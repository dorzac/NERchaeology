No term c o u l d be more a p p r o p r i a t e to d e s c r i b e the f i e l d
seasons spent in S e m i n o l e Canyon State H i s t o r i c a l Park than
Interagency C o o p e r a t i o n . The TPWD staff, Park S u p e r i n t e n d e n t s
Ken Benad and Wayne H a l e y , Emmett "Pancho" Brotherton, and
Emma Lee Duncan not only provided the professional support to
ease our f i e l d l o g i s t i c s but became our v a l u e d friends i n our
home away from home. Austin-based assistance was provided
by Ron R a l p h , a r c h e o l o g i s t , and R i c k W i l k e r s o n , surveyor.
N a t i o n a l Park S e r v i c e rangers, Bob Gamer and M i g u e l
B e n a v i d e s , were of s p e c i a l h e l p the last weeks of the f i e l d
season, t r a n s p o r t i n g our e q u i p m e n t to and from Panther Cave
and towing us into port when we stalled on Lake Amistad.
The h o s p i t a l i t y of our host the first season, Jack S k i l e s
of Langtry, was just one example of h i s continuing interest
and support of a r c h e o l o g y in the Lower Pecos R i v e r r e g i o n .
The second season, our l a n d l o r d , E m i l i o Hinojosa of Comstock,
a l o n g - t i m e friend of our p r i n c i p a l i n v e s t i g a t o r , b e c a m e our
friend as w e l l .
Landowners, John Zuberbueler and Gertrude R i e d e l , saved
us many hours by a l l o w i n g entry to Presa Canyon across t h e i r
property. S i m i l a r l y , Mr. and Mrs. LeRoy Kesler of Del Rio
extended p e r m i s s i o n for us to c o m p l e t e our work at 41VV364
from their s i d e of the Park. W a l t e r K i n g of Comstock g a v e
us the o p p o r t u n i t y to record sites on P a i n t e d Canyon for
c o m p a r i s o n to our s a m p l e w i t h i n the Park. Other r e s i d e n t s
of Comstock and Langtry whose kindess is remembered by the
f i e l d crew a r e B u d d y W h i t e a n d H e l e n S a m p l e .
Numerous p r i v a t e citizens expressed c o n s i d e r a b l e interest
and support of the p i c t o g r a p h survey - most notably, Dr. and
Mrs. D.J. S i b l e y , Rosemary J o n e s , L o u i t a W i l s o n , a n d B o b P a r v i n
The a c q u i s i t i o n of prior rock art d o c u m e n t a t i o n was m a d e
p o s s i b l e t h r o u g h the g e n e r o s i t y of Dr. D a v i d G e b h a r d , The
University of C a l i f o r n i a at Santa Barbara, Dr. Terry Grieder
of the U n i v e r s i t y of Texas at A u s t i n , The Texas M e m o r i a l
M u s e u m , and the W i t t e Museum of San Antonio. Partial f u n d i n g
for the r e p r o d u c t i o n of Dr. G e b h a r d ' s p h o t o g r a p h i c c o l l e c t i o n
was s u p p l i e d by the U n i v e r s i t y of Texas at A u s t i n t h r o u g h the
offices of the V i c e - P r e s i d e n t for Research and the a s s i s t a n c e
of Ross S h i p m a n . P e r m i s s i o n to r e p r o d u c e K i r k l a n d ' s o r i g i n a l
water colors was granted by the Texas M e m o r i a l M u s e u m .
The a n a l y s i s p e r i o d d e p e n d e d upon the t a l e n t s of many
people. Dr. Clara Ho of the Bureau of Economic Geology, The
U n i v e r s i t y of Texas at A u s t i n , ran the p h o s p h a t e tests and
p r o v i d e d an e x p l a n a t i o n of the process. M i c h a e l Zolensky,
whom we met t h r o u g h the r e c o m m e n d a t i o n of D e n i s e S c h m a n d t Besserat of the UT M i d d l e East Center, d i d the p o r t i o n of
t h e p i g m e n t a n a l y s i s reported a s A p p e n d i x I I . H a r o l d V i n e g a r ,

of S h e l l O i l Company, H o u s t o n , and Stephen Smith of Dynatech
Corporation in Massachusetts, discussed the thermal properties
of rocks w i t h us. Bob S l o c u m of the U n i v e r s i t y of Texas at
A u s t i n and Dr. Robert Egan of the U n i v e r s i t y of N e b r a s k a
i d e n t i f i e d and described the l i f e cyle of l i c h e n . Dr. Mason
Hale of the S m i t h s o n i a n Insitution corresponded regarding his
e x p e r i m e n t s w i t h l i c h e n growths on Mayan r u i n s . T. L i n d s a y
Baker of the P a n h a n d l e P l a i n s M u s e u m , Canyon, Texas, shared
his enormous knowledge of early w i n d m i l l technology. Ed
McCarson, now of Carta V a l l e y , provided i n v a l u a b l e information
on the early site of Flanders and on the construction of the
wi n d m i 1 1 .
Radiocarbon dating of samples from Black Cave was supported
by grants from Sigma Xi and the U n i v e r s i t y Research Institute.
Dr. W i l l i a m W. Newcomb, Jr. was most h e l p f u l in o b t a i n i n g the
latter f u n d i n g . The University of Texas R a d i o c a r b o n Laboratory
staff, Alejandra Varela and Salvatore Valastro, deserve special
m e n t i o n for t h e i r assistance w i t h these assays.
Pentax Corporation p r o v i d e d the photographic equipment
for the documentation of 41VV364 and Del Foster of San Antonio
gave freely of his technical expertise in photogrammetry.
Dennett, M u e s s i g and Associates, Ltd. of Iowa City, Iowa
a c c o m p l i s h e d the stereophotogrammetric recording of the rock
art. This major task, w h i c h taxed the ingenuity of photographers
and archeologists a l i k e , was largely accomplished through the
efforts of Sara Dennett, Bob Ryan and Hans M u e s s i g . They shared
our f i e l d experiences l i k e veterans and returned to Iowa with
our sincere thanks for a job well done. .
T h i s m a n u s c r i p t benefitted from the comments and c r i t i c i s m s
of Ron R a l p h , Drs. E. Mott D a v i s , James A. Neely, R i c h a r d P.
S c h a e d e l , Joel D. G u n n , and W i l l i a m W. Newcomb, Jr. Dr.
Newcomb's experience with Lower Pecos pictographs was of
i n e s t i m a b l e v a l u e to our a n a l y s i s .
The p h o t o g r a m m e t r i c plots i l l u s t r a t e d in this report
were drafted by Dennett, M u e s s i g and Associates. A d d i t i o n a l
maps and figures were drawn by Sandy P. Hannum and Carol R.
F abac.
P h o t o g r a p h i c p l a t e s were prepared by D o u g l a s B. Comstock.
Typing and p r o o f r e a d i n g were shared by Deborah S m i t h , Carol
Fabac and Leland C. Bement.
F i n a l l y , s a v i n g the best for last, let me sing the praises
of the fabled Gunga Patrol. Over the l o n g f i e l d seasons, the
crew n e c e s s a r i l y c h a n g e d b u t , in some senses, stayed the same.
Despite the heat, the arduous packing in and out of the canyons,
the sometimes l e s s - t h a n - i d e a l l i v i n g c o n d i t i o n s , their professional
a t t i t u d e and sense of humor never f a i l e d . In order of a p p e a r a n c e ,
the cast i n c l u d e d D a v i d G. R o b i n s o n , R i c h a r d P. W a t s o n , Bruce A.
N i g h t e n g a l e , James R. P l i s k a , and Leland C. Bement. Lee Bement
a l s o p r o v i d e d a l l the artifact d e s c r i p t i o n s for t h i s report.
M a r g a r e t J. K l u g e joined in the work at 41VV364. Three cheers
for the Patrol, the best to be found.

In almost every set of acknowledgements, the statement
is made "this project could not have been carried out without
...". In this case, that is fact. Our p r i n c i p a l investigator,
D a v i d S. D i b b l e , shared his expertise in the region and prompted
m u c h of the i n t e r p r e t i v e content of this report. More than
that, he g a v e each and every one of the crew the o p p o r t u n i t y
to learn to know and l o v e the Lower Pecos.

of E u r o p e a n c u l t u r e are g e n e r a l l y g r o u p e d as H i s t o r i c rock

sequencing based on material c u l t u r e , stratigraphy, and radiocarbon assays .
The formation of S e m i n o l e Canyon State Historical Park
is the c u l m i n a t i o n of over forty years of r e c o g n i t i o n of the
rock art of the Lower Pecos River region as a v a l u e d and
e n d a n g e r e d p u b l i c resource (Pearce a n d Jackson 1933; K i r k l a n d
1937; Jackson 1938; Graham and Davis 1958; Gebhard 1960, 1965).
In 1973, a c t i n g u p o n the r e c o m m e n d a t i o n of the Texas H i s t o r i c a l
Committee, archeologists, art h i s t o r i a n s , and interested
citizens, Texas Parks and W i l d l i f e Department (TPWD) a c q u i r e d
1,430 acres of the Fate Bell Ranch a l o n g the western bank of
S e m i n o l e Canyon in Val Verde County.
In 1976, an a d d i t i o n a l
670 acres along the east bank of Seminole Canyon, and i n c l u d i n g
the lower reaches of Presa Canyon, were a c q u i r e d . I n i t i a l
development was completed and the park dedicated in October of
1980.
The primary objectives in e s t a b l i s h m e n t of the Park, as
set forth in the Master P l a n for d e v e l o p m e n t , are the preserv a t i o n of the v a l u a b l e and f r a g i l e a r c h e o l o g i c a l resources
(TPWD 1973: 11). Toward that e n d , s p e c i a l s t u d i e s on p i c t o g r a p h d e t e r i o r a t i o n and the i m p a c t of p u b l i c access on a l l
a r c h e o l o g i c a l sites were r e c o m m e n d e d . In 1980, TPWD and the
Texas A r c h e o l o g i c a l Survey (TAS), The U n i v e r s i t y of Texas at
A u s t i n , entered a n Interagency C o o p e r a t i o n Contract d e s i g n e d

After c o n s u l t a t i o n with TPWD archeologists and officials of the
Texas A n t i q u i t i e s Committee, work was i n i t i a t e d under the
a u t h o r i z a t i o n of State A n t i q u i t i e s Permit No. 234. Later studies

THE NATURAL SETTING OF S E M I N O L E C A N Y O N P A R K

To the casual v i s i t o r a p p r o a c h i n g Seminole Canyon, the
r o l l i n g h i l l s , sparsely green with thorny shrubs and scattered
grasses, appear monotonously b a r r e n . Once in the Park, the
p r e c i p i t o u s canyon w a l l s p r o v i d e a d r a m a t i c contrast. In the
summer, the sun r e f l e c t i n g from the w h i t e l i m e s t o n e is o p p r e s s i v e and in the w i n t e r , the w i n d s cut to the bone. No wonder
t h e n , that t h i s e n v i r o n m e n t has been d e s c r i b e d as stark, h a r s h ,
and h o s t i l e . But t h i s d i s t r e s s e d c o u n t r y s i d e is not the h a b i t a t
of the p r e h i s t o r i c hunters and gatherers, nor of the first
E u r o p e a n s to i n t r u d e into the Lower Pecos.
The accounts of the first e x p l o r e r s to penetrate the
r e g i o n , and the eye-witness t e s t i m o n i a l s of local ranchers,
are viewed by W i l l i a m s - D e a n (1978: 229) in conjunction with
the p a l e o b o t a n i c a l data:
The e v i d e n c e is fragmented, and scattered over 6000
years of coprolites, bones, S p a n i s h records, and
ranchers boyhood memories, but the e v i d e n c e a l l suggests
the same type of general l a n d s c a p e : increased s o i l cover
s u p p o r t i n g g r a s s l a n d v e g e t a t i o n o n t h e u p l a n d s w i t h water
present in t h e p o t h o l e s a n d a g a v e a n d p r i c k l y pear a v a i l a b l e , a n d t h e rocky, r u g g e d canyons p r o b a b l y covered w i t h
woody s c r u b v e g e t a t i o n s i m i l a r to that found today.
There was t h e n , in the not too d i s t a n t past, more s o i l , more
v e g e t a t i o n , more water, and more game. The p r e c o n c e p t i o n of
s m a l l b a n d s of hunters and gatherers as wretched nomads on a
constant round just to stave off s t a r v a t i o n and m a l n u t r i t i o n
has been d i s p e l l e d by e t h n o g r a p h i c studies. Instead, a p i c t u r e
emerges of people nourished by an eclectic d i e t , attuned to
the a v a i l a b l e resources, with a technology adequate to their
needs, and with more l e i s u r e time than their a g r a r i a n fellows.
The e x p e n d i t u r e of time and energy in the rock art alone
testifies to a s u r p l u s w h i c h could be devoted to r i t u a l or
aesthetic expression.
A shorter l i f e span was e x p e c t e d l y t h e i r l o t . A c c i d e n t s ,

The effects of recent a l t e r a t i o n s to the l a n d s c a p e and

cut sequence which followed can be correlated w i t h i n c r e a s i n g
aridity and t e m p e r a t u r e s , and frequent f l o o d i n g . The m a g n i tude of recent floods has resulted in the f l u s h i n g of the canyon bottoms, the eradication of much of the natural v e g e t a t i o n ,

Prior to the s u b m e r g e n c e of the mouth of S e m i n o l e Canyon by
Lake A m i s t a d , p a s s a g e to the Rio G r a n d e via the canyon bottom

In contrast to the r e l a t i v e l y s t r a i g h t p a t h of the lower

dense v e g e t a t i o n at every turn. M i n o r t r i b u t a r i e s are l e s s

The acreage of the Park is computed at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2100
acres h o r i z o n t a l l y ; the a c t u a l l a n d surface, i n c l u d i n g the
sheer v e r t i c a l w a l l s of the canyons, far exceeds that figure.
It is w i t h i n the latter that the rock art is found on the
natural c a n v a s of smooth l i m e s t o n e surfaces and in the h o l l o w e d
shelters w h i c h make such welcome h a v e n s from c o l d winds in
w i n t e r and hot sun in summer.
The b o u n d s of the Park were e s t a b l i s h e d p r i m a r i l y on the
extent of the rock art, and do not i n c l u d e the headwaters of
the canyons. Therefore, the water catchment areas are beyond
the control of TPWD, a serious p r o b l e m d i s c u s s e d in later
r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s for c o n s e r v a t i o n and p r e s e r v a t i o n . S i m i l a r l y ,

of s i t e s o u t s i d e the area i n t e n s i v e l y surveyed.
The u p l a n d areas of the Park are u n d i f f e r e n t i a t e d flats
fringed by low r o u n d e d h i l l s , outcrops of the B u d a l i m e s t o n e
formation. T r a v e l between the u p l a n d flats and the canyons
below is by m e a n s of the s l o p e s in the u p p e r r e a c h e s and the
t r i b u t a r i e s in the lower.
The flood p l a i n of the Rio G r a n d e , w h i c h m u s t h a v e figured
p r o m i n e n t l y in the economy and travel routes in prehistory,
is now under the waters of Lake A m i s t a d .
Four d e s c r i p t i v e terms w i l l be used to i n d i c a t e the v a r i o u s
t o p o g r a p h i c s e t t i n g s of p r e h i s t o r i c sites or resources - u p l a n d
refers to the h i g h mesas or i n t e r f l u v i a l d i v i d e s w h i c h , in the
Park, are never far from the canyon resources; lower s l o p e s are
the g e n t l e r projections in the u p p e r canyon systems w h i c h afford
easy access to the canyon; canyon bottom and rim are selfe x p l a n a t o r y . A fifth d i s t i n c t i o n u s u a l l y m a d e , the steep,

been subjected to alteration over a long period of slow degradation
SOILS
A recent soil survey of Val Verde County (Soil Survey Staff
1982) has been i s s u e d and soil u n i t s w i t h i n the Park are m a p p e d .
G e n e r a l l y , three topographic s i t u a t i o n s reflect v a r y i n g types and
depths of sediments.
Most common is the Lantry Rock-outcrop c o m p l e x , s h a l l o w
rocky soil with 45 to 70 percent exposed bedrock. Found on
steep to very steep s l o p e s , this a s s o c i a t i o n p r e v a i l s a l o n g the
numerous feeder canyons and the m a i n Seminole-Presa system. Susc e p t a b i l i t y of t h i s t h i n and v a r i a b l e soil m a n t l e to erosion is
accentuated by the sparsity of v e g e t a t i v e cover and the l a r g e
exposures of bedrock. Archeological material found on this type
is g e n e r a l l y d i s p l a c e d from its o r i g i n a l context.
F r i n g i n g the steeper s l o p e s , on more gentle gradients, are
areas of the Zorra Rock outcrop c o m p l e x , s h a l l o w stony soils with
l i t t l e w a t e r h o l d i n g capacity. T h e e r o s i o n a l hazard i s s t i l l h i g h
but rock outcrops, which cover 20 to 30 percent of the surface,
act in consort with low ground cover, to retard e v a p o r a t i o n and
runoff (TPWD 1973: 87).
Two areas of V a l v e r d e silty clay loam are generally referred
to t h r o u g h o u t t h i s report as "flats". Found on the east and
west banks of Seminole Canyon, this deep soil is moderately perm e a b l e and has the h i g h e s t water retention c a p a b i l i t y of any type
w i t h i n the Park. However, surface c r u s t i n g , w h i c h forms r e a d i l y ,
tends to slow absorption. The o n - g o i n g erosion in these areas
is seen in the r i l l s and g u l l i e s and in the d e f l a t i o n of s o i l s
exposing artifacts of all time periods on the same surface. The
effects of h i s t o r i c c o n s t r u c t i o n i n c l u d e the entrapment of deeper
sediments in l o w - l y i n g sections a l o n g the r a i l r o a d e m b a n k m e n t .
Archeological sites found on these flats are burned rock
m i d d e n s and hearths, often exposed by erosional c h a n n e l s r u n n i n g
from the fringing low h i l l s of Buda limestone. Two cycles, one
of a g g r a d a t i o n f o l l o w e d by a period of d e g r a d a t i o n , can be detected at these l o c a t i o n s . S u b s e q u e n t to the period of o c c u p a t i o n ,
cultural debris was s h a l l o w l y buried by sediments washed in from
the adjacent s l o p e s . Presently, the d e g r a d a t i o n process is ree x p o s i n g the features. Thus, differential v i s i b i l i t y can be presumed to b i a s the a r c h e o l o g i c a l record in favor of the narrower
flats restricted by the s u r r o u n d i n g h i l l s . It is p o s s i b l e , but
not demonstrated, that sites of these types remain buried in the
w i d e r expanses of c a l i c h e flats such as l i e a l o n g the east b a n k
of S e m i n o l e Canyon just south of U.S. 90.
Small areas of Langtry cobbly loam and S h u m l a l o a m are m a p p e d
in the northern segments of the Park. The former is now the s i t e

of the m a i n t e n a n c e yard and r a n g e r h e a d q u a r t e r s . These
d e v e l o p e d areas of the Park were e x c l u d e d from our survey.
The g e n e r a l l y m e a g e r s o i l cover is i n part a p r o d u c t of
modern l a n d use. The i n i t i a l breakup of the subsurface
l i m e s t o n e and c a l i c h e layers is c r e d i t e d to the s h a r p hooves
of l i v e s t o c k ( W i l l i a m s - D e a n 1978: 28).
Denudation of the
g r o u n d cover by o v e r g r a z i n g exposed the t h i n s o i l s to e r o s i o n .
On the l i m e s t o n e benches w h i c h step down to the c a n y o n rim
a b o v e the Rio G r a n d e , some s e m b l a n c e of e a r l i e r c o n d i t i o n s
may be r e f l e c t e d by 5 to 10 cm. of soil r e t a i n e d by n a t u r a l l y
o c c u r r i n g l i m e s t o n e blocks w h i c h act as a dam a g a i n s t runoff. These s e d i m e n t s are now cut by c h a n n e l i n g of the runoff
from these h i l l s , and are often d i s p l a c e d and swept into the
R i o G r a n d e , e x p o s i n g t h e bedrock. T h e a s s u m p t i o n is made
that t h i s a c t i v e d e g r a d a t i o n s i m i l a r l y occurred t h r o u g h o u t

D i s m a n t l i n g of C a i r n A, 41VV364 pp.146 -159).
The f l u s h i n g of the canyon bottoms by m a s s i v e floods
( A p p e n d i x I ) h a s r e s u l t e d i n barren floors a n d s t e r i l e g r a v e l
beds. Remnants of the s o i l s once deep in portions of the
canyons can s t i l l be seen at a few of the a r c h e o l o g i c a l sites
- most notably a l a r g e shelter at the m o u t h of a s m a l l t r i b u tary to S e m i n o l e Canyon just north of the Rio G r a n d e (41VV335).
A m a s s i v e rock f a l l has protected an i s l a n d of s o i l w h i c h i n
turn supports h u g e and a n c i e n t oak trees such as those des c r i b e d in t h e r e c o l l e c t i o n s o f l o n g - t i m e r a n c h e r s ( W i l l i a m s Dean 1978: 239).
The converse is better i l l u s t r a t e d at
other s h e l t e r a n d rock a r t sites w h e r e i n d e e p c u l t u r a l d e p o s i t s
reported in the 1930's are now only s h i f t i n g beds of g r a v e l s
(see 41VV72 , for e x a m p l e ) .
The loss of m u c h of the surface s e d i m e n t s has p r i m a r i l y
affected a r c h e o l o g i c a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s by the d i s r u p t i o n of
the o r i g i n a l context of the s i t e , the d i s p l a c e m e n t h o r i z o n t a l l y
and vertically of cultural material, and the probable eradic a t i o n of some sites and the e x p o s u r e of others.
CLIMATE
Generally described as semi-arid, the modern climate
r e g i m e is c h a r a c t e r i z e d by temperature r a n g e s from 11 to 111
d e g r e e s F. and an a n n u a l r a i n f a l l of l e s s t h a n 18 i n c h e s .

NATURAL SETTING

sparse v e g e t a t i o n do l i t t l e to retard r a p i d runoff, thus m u c h
of this d e l u g e r a i n f a l l is lost. The most catastrophic flood
on record for the last 10,000 years (Patton and D i b b l e 1982)
resulted from the effects of H u r r i c a n e A l i c e in 1954.
P a l e o e n v i r o n m e n t a l reconstructions (Bryant 1969, 1977;
Bryant and Shafer 1977) s u g g e s t a g r a d u a l trend in a r i d i t y
since the terminal Pleistocene when the big game s t i l l s u r v i v e d
in a cooler, wetter l a n d . This drying trend, interrupted by
s l i g h t m e s i c i n t e r l u d e s , c o n t i n u e s u n t i l today.
One m e s i c i n t e r l u d e , w e l 1 - d o c u m e n t e d by the fauna! and
p o l l e n records from Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain 1968;
Bryant 1969), allowed the expansion of bison herds into the
region ca. 2500 years ago. The artifact a s s e m b l a g e recovered
i n a s s o c i a t i o n w i t h m a s s i v e bison k i l l s i n d i c a t e s a t t e n d a n t
hunters followed the herds, p e r h a p s from a central Texas homeland (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Corroboration of the increased
h u m i d i t y is seen in the sedimentary record at Arenosa Shelter
(Patton and D i b b l e 1982). D u r i n g the period r a d i o c a r b o n - d a t e d
from 3200 to 2400 years a g o , d e p o s i t i o n a l l e v e l s i n d i c a t e more
frequent but less severe f l o o d i n g - a p o s s i b l e r e f l e c t i o n of
the increased vegetational control of runoff. As second such
migration of the bison around A.D. 1200 is tentatively suggested
in s u r r o u n d i n g areas ( D i l l e h a y 1974; Lynott 1979; C o l l i n s 1972)
but whether t h i s i m p l i e s any c l i m a t i c v a c i l l a t i o n in the Lower
Pecos region has yet to be documented. E t h n o g r a p h i c references
(Griffen 1969; 93-94) to bison hunting in the Lower Pecos suggest
that at the time of European contact, grasslands were a g a i n
s u f f i c i e n t to s u p p o r t l a r g e h e r b i v o r e s .
D u r i n g the t i m e of the p e o p l e a r c h e o l o g i c a l 1 y known as
the P a l e o i n d i a n , the area was a parkland savannah replete with
large game a n i m a l s . The t r a d i t i o n a l picture of their l i f e s t y l e
is one of dietary efficiency d e p e n d e n t upon the h u n t i n g of
these mega fauna in an e n v i r o n m e n t q u i t e different from that of
today. By the time the p e o p l e w i t h whom we are l a r g e l y c o n c e r n e d ,
the undifferentiated hunter-gatherers of the Archaic Period,
began to l e a v e traces of their occupation, the savannah had
retreated and the t r a n s i t i o n to the current s e m i - a r i d c l i m a t e
had b e g u n . Yet as w i l l be more f u l l y d e v e l o p e d in the l a t e r
discussions of the i m p a c t of m o d e r n m a n , c l i m a t e is not the
sole determinant of aridity. Under prior conditions of deeper
s o i l s and denser v e g e t a t i o n , the increased retention of the
a v a i l a b l e m o i s t u r e c o u n t e r m a n d e d to some degree the h a r s h effects
of sun and w i n d . T h u s , the e f f e c t i v e r a i n f a l l was greater
whether or not the actual amounts which fell were the same or
more than today.

comitant diversity of flora and fauna. By i m p l i c a t i o n , this
diversity provided optional resources responsive to fluctuations
in effective r a i n f a l l . A clas sificatory system d e v i s e d by
Flyr (1966) s p e c i f i c a l l y for the Amistad D i s t r i c t r e l i e d upon
topographic distinctions to describe four vegetational units V e g a - T e r r a c e , Cliff-Canyon, U p l a n d s ( H i l l s ) , and U p l a n d (Flats).
The first, a l t h o u g h not represented in the Park, formerly
bordered the Rio Grande and is now inundated by Amistad Reservoir
An inventory of the Park flora, taken prior to its d e v e l o p ment, stresses the d i v e r s i t y of s p e c i e s , a t t r i b u t a b l e to the
numerous micro-environments promoted by the broken terrain.
Three broad categories were defined based on physiography slopes and draws, u p l a n d s h r u b s and g r a s s l a n d s , and canyons
(TPWD 1973: 88).
Both cl assificatory nomenclatures are roughly
equatable; the first is more generally a p p l i c a b l e while the
second is P a r k - s p e c i f i c .
Vega-Terrace V e g e t a t i o n
A l t h o u g h no e x a m p l e of t h i s u n i t was i n c o r p o r a t e d by
the Park, the p r o x i m i t y to the R i o G r a n d e made it an integral
part of the a b o r i g i n a l subsistence rounds. Flyr (1966) reports most of the major species g r o w i n g in t h i s setting were
m o d e r n i n t r o d u c t i o n s - bermuda g r a s s , reeds, t a m a r i s k , tree

Cliff-Canyon Vegetation/Canyons
The narrow, s t e e p - s i d e d canyons are d o m i n a t e d by oak
g r o v e s , favored browsing areas for the white-tailed deer.
Other trees commonly found along the canyon bottoms and on
the t a l u s slopes in front of o c c u p i e d shelters are m o u n t a i n

NATURAL SETTIMG

U p l a n d s (Flats)/Upland Flats and Grassland
Variations in the d i s t r i b u t i o n of cenizo, yucca, kidneywood, guayacan, desert yaupon, acacias, agarita, white and
black brush, and prickly pear characterize the u p l a n d flats.
Cedar encroaching from the north, has firmly established a
hold on the overgrazed u p l a n d s ; l i t t l e is yet to be seen in
the Park. Grasses, reported as sparse in the early assessment
of the Park, are now r e e s t a b l i s h i n g themselves on the deeper
s o i l s . It is here that the dichotomy between pasture and
parkland is most d r a m a t i c a l l y i l l u s t r a t e d . This was most
apparent d u r i n g the drought of 1980 when the fence l i n e
separated two e q u a l l y brown and desiccated areas. The later
summer rains caused a m i r a c u l o u s r e j u v e n a t i o n w i t h i n the
Park. Long dormant p l a n t s sprang up; d r i e d - u p shrubbery
bloomed; and the grasses grew h i p - h i g h . The l o n e t a l l tree,
a mesquite so d i s t i n c t i v e it is used as a landmark on the
trail to the Rio Grande, appeared dead but sprouted new leaves.
The excessive spring rains of 1981 first produced a riotous
mass of blooming plants set against a background of green.
As they continued, some of the plants such as the ocotillo
and leather plants, appeared to sicken from a surfeit of water.
One side effect of the drought not ameliorated by the rains
was the r e d u c t i o n in stands of l e c h e g u i l l a on the rocky slopes
a b o v e the canyons. Favored by the j a v e l i n a to the extent that
ranchers tolerate their presence as a control m e c h a n i s m of
t h i s currently non-useful p l a n t , the l e c h e g u i l l a had been
decimated to the p o i n t that r e j u v e n a t i o n was s e r i o u s l y i m p a i r e d
D e s c r i p t i o n s of the floral c o m p o s i t i o n reported around
the turn of the century sharply contrast w i t h those of today
and the v a r i a n c e is p a r t i a l l y a t t r i b u t a b l e to the economic rel i a n c e on livestock (see W i l l i a m s - D e a n 1978: 30-33 for a
d i s c u s s i o n of this contrast). Sections of the Park have been
removed from grazing for five years (with the exception of
occasional forays by escapees from n e i g h b o r i n g ranches) and
clearly i l l u s t r a t e the effects of the combination of browsing
and grazing domesticates. The r e e s t a b l i s h m e n t of the older
order is beyond the present c a p a b i l i t y of the deteriorated
soils but reflections of the early explorer's accounts of
grasslands are now to be seen on the u p l a n d flats. The erasure of the stands of tall trees from the canyon bottoms by
the recent floods is only m a r g i n a l l y recouped by small groves

FAUNA
The earliest fauna documented in a s s o c i a t i o n w i t h man
are the e x t i n c t b i s o n of Bonfire S h e l t e r , s t a m p e d e d to t h e i r
deaths a b o u t 10,000 years ago ( D i b b l e 1965; D i b b l e and L o r r a i n e
1968; D i b b l e 1970). S t i l l e a r l i e r s p e c i e s of l o n g - v a n i s h e d
m e g a f a u n a - e l e p h a n t , c a m e l , and horse - l i e d e e p e r in the
same site. The r e l a t i o n s h i p of man to that l e v e l has yet to
be t h o r o u g h l y v e r i f i e d .
As was the case w i t h the flora, the bone a r c h e o l o g i c a l 1 y
recovered from d e p o s i t s d a t a b l e to the l a s t 8000 years is of
w i l d a n i m a l s found in the r e g i o n today. The most n o t a b l e exception is the modern bison bone so incontrovertibly represented at B o n f i r e Shelter in d e p o s i t s d a t a b l e to 2500 years
ago, and to a lesser degree at other sites i n the area ( D i b b l e
n.d.; Ross 1965; Prewitt 1970). The presence of this large
h e r b i v o r e , a u g m e n t e d by the p o l l e n record from B o n f i r e and
the D e v i l ' s Mouth Site, formed the b a s i s for a proposed m e s i c
i n t e r l u d e w i t h concomitant e x p a n s i o n of the g r a s s l a n d h a b i t a t
(Bryant 1969; Bryant and Shafer 1977). It is p o s t u l a t e d
that b i s o n herds and t h e i r attendant hunters i n t r u d e d into the
Lower Pecos for a brief t i m e u n t i l , u n d e r i n c r e a s i n g l y a r i d
c o n d i t i o n s , the g r a s s l a n d s retreated once a g a i n . On the other
h a n d , L o r r a i n (1966: 223) sees no s i g n i f i c a n t e c o l o g i c a l imp l i c a t i o n s for the Lower Pecos in s u c h a brief i n c u r s i o n .
This is undoubtedly a product of her estimation of this bone
d e p o s i t of 800 a n i m a l s r e s u l t i n g from a s i n g l e e v e n t , a v i e w
not h e l d by the excavator ( D i b b l e and L o r r a i n 1968: 43).
Less e c o n o m i c a l l y i m p o r t a n t a n i m a l s p r o v i d e some i n d i c a t i o n s of an altered e n v i r o n m e n t . The few r e m a i n s recovered
of g o p h e r s and badgers, no l o n g e r r e s i d e n t in the area,
suggest deeper s o i l s s i n c e eroded (Raun 1966: 216). The
p r e v a l e n c e of c o t t o n t a i l s over j a c k r a b b i t s in the a r c h e o l o g i c a l
d e p o s i t s , the converse of the present r a t i o , may reflect a
s h i f t in response to a r i d i t y w h i c h favors the j a c k r a b b i t
(Raun 1966; Word and Douglas 1970). An a l t e r n a t i v e expanation
is the greater v u l n e r a b i l i t y of c o t t o n t a i l s to snares or traps
(Raun 1966). Some c a u t i o n is i n t r o d u c e d into the a s s u m p t i o n s

of p r e v i o u s faunal c o m p o s i t i o n as a reflection of the specific
h a b i t a t by the presence of the t r e e - l o v i n g porcupine, both
in the past and today (Raun 1966: 210).
During the duration of our field season, white-tailed
deer were seen throughout the Park but favored the brushy
draws near 41VV226 and the t r i b u t a r y heads to S e m i n o l e Canyon.
In the Presa Canyon segment, they were most common in the
oak groves near the canyon bottom in the u p p e r reaches.
Seriously weakened by the d r o u g h t of 1980, several were seen
h a n g i n g , feet snared between the u p p e r wires of the park
fence. As a consequence, TPWD removed an upper strand to reduce the potential for accidental death.
J a v e l i n a , recent migrants to the area, were often flushed
from the debris-choked canyon bottoms. Rock and ground
squirrels were r e l a t i v e l y common; only g l i m p s e s were c a u g h t
of a gray fox who i n h a b i t s upper S e m i n o l e .
P o r c u p i n e , raccoon, and both striped and hog-nosed skunks
were seen a l i v e and dead a l o n g the h i g h w a y . The only r i n g t a i l e d cat seen had been struck by a car on U.S. 90 near the
Park entrance.
Jackrabbits and cottontails were l e g i o n ; d u r i n g the drought
they browsed the roadsides in droves. By the 1981 field
season the p o p u l a t i o n appeared on a down cycle but still
numerous .
The b i r d p o p u l a t i o n , d o m i n a t e d by v u l t u r e s , was most
n o t a b l e for canyon wrens, c l i f f s w a l l o w s , l a r k b u n t i n g s , M e x i c a n o r i o l e s , c a r d i n a l s , k i l l d e e r , a n d scaled q u a i l . Predatory b i r d s , seen most frequently from the canyon bottoms, were
red-tailed hawks and great horned owls.
The amphibians, and r e p t i l e s proliferated after the s p r i n g
rains of 1981.
Frogs and lizards were abundant and apparently
supported a plethora of snakes in turn. Black racers, coachw h i p s and water snakes were c o m m o n ; p o i s o n o u s snakes were not
often encountered but rock rattlers, western d i a m o n d b a c k s ,
and one coral snake were seen.
WATER RESOURCES

The concept of water as the governing factor in preh i s t o r i c u t i l i z a t i o n of the Lower Pecos forms the basis for
m u c h of the proposed a d a p t i v e m o d e l s of a b o r i g i n a l c u l t u r e ,
a n a l o g i e s to the western Desert C u l t u r e as proposed by J e n n i n g s
(1957; K e l l e y 1959; Johnson 1964) and to a n c i e n t and modern
C o a h u i l t e c a n groups (Taylor 1964). The a p p l i c a b i l i t y of
those models to the Seminole Canyon area is b i a s e d by two
considerations - the proximity of the permanently flowing
Rio Grande and the d i s t r i b u t i o n of semi-permanent water in
the upper reaches of the canyon. A third factor to be considered is what c o n s t i t u t e s " e n o u g h " water. The needs of

m o d e r n t e c h n o l o g y a n d l i v e s t o c k h a v e t r a n s l a t e d into t h e
d e s i g n a t i o n of S e m i n o l e W a t e r i n g H o l e as the "only p e r m a n e n t
water between U.S. 90 and the Rio Grande" p r i m a r i l y because it
was the source most adequate for the needs of the l a r g e labor
forces employed in railroad construction. Even t h i s failed in
the s p r i n g of 1882 (San A n t o n i o D a i l y Express A p r i l 8, 1882)
p r o b a b l y as a r e s u l t of d r o u g h t c o m p o u n d e d by o v e r - c o n s u m p t i o n .
The d i s t r i b u t i o n of the water in the canyons today perhaps a l s o reflects three modern-day factors w h i c h are at
present u n q u a n t i f i e d . The effects of the i m p o u n d m e n t of
Amistad R e s e r v o i r on the water t a b l e may be seen in the depths
of recently d r i l l e d w e l l s w h i c h local ranchers state are much
shallower than was necessary in the past (see W i 1 1 i a m s - D e a n
1978: 24 for corroborative statements). The f l u s h i n g of the
canyon bottoms, and the r e p l a c e m e n t of s e d i m e n t s and v e g e t a t i o n
w i t h m o b i l e g r a v e l beds, m a y h a v e p e r c e p t i b l y a l t e r e d t h e
catchment p o t e n t i a l . Thirdly, the denudation of s o i l s and
v e g e t a t i o n on the u p l a n d s has lowered the r e t e n t i o n c a p a b i l i t i e s ,
thus the a v a i l a b i l i t y of seep s p r i n g water.
The oft-used explanatory m e a s u r e for site d i s t r i b u t i o n distance to a v a i l a b l e water - is rendered suspect by the presumed alterations in the catchment c a p a b i l i t i e s of the canyons
and by the e p h e m e r a l i t y of the casual water. A d d i t i o n a l l y ,
d i s t a n c e in S e m i n o l e and Presa canyons is a f u n c t i o n of the
most r e a s o n a b l e route to the canyon bottoms. C o n s i d e r a t i o n
w a s g i v e n t o c a l c u l a t i n g t h i s factor b u t , g i v e n t h e a b o v e
v a g a r i e s , a n y q u a n t i f i c a t i o n o r m e a s u r e m e n t seems m e a n i n g l e s s .
T h e v a r i a b i l i t y i n a v a i l a b l e water w a s a m p l y demonstrated
d u r i n g the course of t h i s project. D u r i n g the h e i g h t of the
drought in 1980, six sources remained a c t i v e in the upper
canyons. In S e m i n o l e Canyon, water was s t i l l to be found at
the permanent s p r i n g s at 41VV72 and in front of two large
rock s h e l t e r s , 41VV545 and 41VV74. J a c k s o n (1938) reports
that the p o o l s in front of the latter were c o n s i d e r e d as
p e r m a n e n t by the l o c a l l a n d o w n e r s . Water r e t a i n e d in p o o l s
by 41VV75 further downstream is d i s c o u n t e d b e c a u s e of p r o x i m i t y
to the r e s e r v o i r . In Presa Canyon, p o o l s were retained by
g r a v e l beds in front of 41VV212 and 222, and Infierno Spring
s t i l l flowed, a l t h o u g h sparingly.
Stagnation promoted the growth of a l g a e . A concomitant
reduction in the h a b i t a t of a m p h i b i o u s species resulted in a
d r a m a t i c i n c r e a s e i n biomass per pond. At t h i s t i m e , for
e x a m p l e , n i n e s m a l l water s n a k e s were constricted i n t o a comm u n a l e x i s t e n c e in the s m a l l pool by Infierno S p r i n g .
C o n v e r s e l y , after the heavy s p r i n g r a i n s of 1981, Presa Canyon
was a f l o w i n g stream w i t h pools in front of B l a c k Cave in
excess of 5 feet deep. The canyon bottom was i m p a s s a b l e ,
and turtles, frogs, and small fish were abundant. W i t h i n two
weeks the runoff ceased, l e a v i n g water impounded in natural
c o n c a v i t i e s (tinajai,} and flowing from seep l i n e s in the
canyon w a 1 1 s .

NATURAL SETTING

The assumption made here is that prior to the differential eroding of soil mantles, the scouring of the canyon,
and the increasing general aridity, water would be at least
as p l e n t i f u l or more so than it is today. F l u c t u a t i o n s in
the past, of greater m a g n i t u d e and l o n g e r d u r a t i o n than the
d r o u g h t of 1980, u n d o u b t e d l y greatly i n f l u e n c e d the movements
of the p r e h i s t o r i c occupants, c a u s i n g c o n s t r i c t i o n s and exp a n s i o n s centered around the major r i v e r s , but it s h o u l d be
kept in mind that the entire Park is well w i t h i n a day's travel
from the Rio Grande.
To assume a dependence on the canyon bottom water leaves
u n e x p l a i n e d the occupation of rimrock shelters where direct
access was perhaps too easy a descent and too d i f f i c u l t an
ascent. Adjacent to one such s m a l l s h e l t e r , 41VV336, h i g h
above S e m i n o l e Canyon, the t r a v e r t i n e d flow pattern of s m a l l
seep s p r i n g s in an adjacent a l c o v e p r o v i d e s an a l t e r n a t i v e
to a total r e l i a n c e on the river or the canyon water. W h e n
activated by sufficient p r e c i p i t a t i o n , the flow from this
seep, if contained, could temporarily serve the immediate
needs of a short-term occupation by a l i m i t e d number of i n d i v i d u a l s . Analogous situations are probably a factor in the
a p p a r e n t d i f f e r e n t i a l use of rimrock s h e l t e r s where some more
c o m m o d i o u s l o c a t i o n s are i g n o r e d in favor of l e s s s p a c i o u s
accomodations. Travertined remnants of l a r g e r seep s p r i n g s
were found in Panther C a v e , 41VV335, and in the t r i b u t a r y
c o n t a i n i n g 41VV140. Perhaps the most i m p r e s s i v e e x a m p l e of
this in-house p l u m b i n g is in Parida Cave, now o v e r l o o k i n g
Amistad Reservoir just east of the mouth of the Pecos R i v e r .
This spring was reported a c t i v e by Jackson (1938) and A l e x ander (1970).
A l t h o u g h the a v a i l a b i l i t y of water was c e r t a i n l y c r i t i c a l
to the a b o r i g i n a l i n h a b i t a n t s , m u c h as it is to the ranchers
of today, the a s s u m p t i o n that the c u l t u r a l p a t t e r n i n g of the
occupation of the area now known as S e m i n o l e Canyon Park was
predicated u p o n this one resource is s i m p l i s t i c . The water
territoriality proposed for the modern and a n c i e n t C o a h u i l tecans (Taylor 1964) was rooted in the n u c l e a t i o n around
isolated sources. If tethered nomadism, w h e r e i n groups are
l e a s h e d to restricted areas by c r i t i c a l shortages, is to be
a p p l i e d here, the tether m u s t be considered to be a c l o t h e s l i n e a l o n g the major water courses or a d e n d r i t i c c o n f i g u r a t i o n

P R E S E N T V I E W S O F L O W E R PECOS P R E H I S T O R Y

By the time the first map makers came to the Lower Pecos
the area had become known as P a i n t e d C a v e s (Emory 1857;
Y o u n g 1853). The e a r l i e s t p h o t o g r a p h s located at the Barker
Texas History Center are railroad-era ( T u r r i l l n.d.) and show
the t r a i n station known as P a i n t e d C a v e , named for the rock
art in Parida Cave.
Formal a r c h e o l o g i c a 1 work in the r e g i o n began in the
1930's under the sponsorship of private and academic i n s t i tutions. The W i t t e M u s e u m in San A n t o n i o promoted the excav a t i o n s at E a g l e Cave (Davenport 1938) and the S h u m l a caves
(Martin 1933). The S m i t h s o n i a n concentrated on Moorehead
Cave (Setzler 1932-39), now h i g h l y v i s i b l e from the U.S. 90
crossing of the Pecos River. Texas Technological U n i v e r s i t y ' s
i n v e s t i g a t i o n s centered on M u r r a h C a v e (Holden 1937). The
m a t e r i a l s recovered from these projects have been reanalyzed
to structure them for more m e a n i n g f u l c o m p a r i s o n w i t h l a t e r
a r c h e o l o g i c a l i n v e s t i g a t i o n s (Scheutz 1956, 1961, 1963;

The only l a r g e scale e x c a v a t i o n of any site w i t h i n the
Park took p l a c e in 1932 (Pearce and J a c k s o n 1933; Thomas 1933).
The U n i v e r s i t y of Texas sponsored J a c k s o n ' s t r e n c h i n g of Fate

A l t h o u g h the rock art of the Lower Pecos had been known
to m o d e r n man since the m i d - n i n e t e e n t h century, i n t e r e s t
fluoresced in the 1930's. C h r o n o l o g i c a l l y , the first attempt

San Antonio but as no attempt was made to . show anything but
the form of the most b r i l l i a n t p l a n t i n g s , they are more of

Of i n e s t i m a b l e v a l u e are the m e a s u r e d water colors of
Forrest K i r k l a n d . A consummate draftsman, obsessed by his

PRESENT VIEWS

77, 83, 201, 217, 230, and 377 were a l l c o p i e d by K i r k l a n d .
Their notes and articles (Kirkland n.d., 1937a, 1937b, 1938,.
1939) also reflect the artist's thoughtful i n s i g h t s into
the problems of chronology and deterioration.
The greatest v a l u e to our assessment l i e s in K i r k l a n d ' s
intent to present the pictographs as faithful reproductions
of what was painted by the prehistoric artist. Thus s l i g h t
breaks and f l a k i n g were ignored (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:
22) and the form of the figure interpreted from the remaining
paint, augmented by his i n e x h a u s t i b l e patience for detail and
intimate knowledge of the conventions, stylizations , and
motifs of the different styles of rock art. Using his drawings
it is often p o s s i b l e to discern in the most faded pictographs
the form and relationship of the figures. S l i g h t errors in
omission (cover i l l u s t r a t i o n ) a t t r i b u t a b l e to the c o m p l e x i t y
of the p a n e l s , are more than compensated for by his g e n e r a l
l e v e l of accuracy and f i d e l i t y of r e n d i t i o n .
It would be an error to compare the current c o n d i t i o n of
the p i c t o g r a p h s w i t h his d e p i c t i o n s of five d e c a d e s ago because K i r k l a n d ' s i n t e n t was to p e r c e i v e t h r o u g h the eyes of
the artist. For that, we must turn to the p h o t o g r a p h i c record
and notes of the second p i o n e e r in Lower Pecos rock art
s t u d i e s , A.T. Jackson (n.d., 1938), but an assessment of the
m e r i t s of the a r t i s t i c a p p r o a c h resurfaces in r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s
for further rock art s t u d i e s .

for comparison of rock art deterioration over the last 50

After a hiatus during World War I I , a r c h e o l o g i c a l interest
was resurrected in a new form, p r i m a r i l y as a result of i n d i v i d u a l effort (Butler 1948; Taylor 1949a, 1949b). Herbert C.
Taylor introduced the concept of precise g r i d d e d excavations
with strict vertical control, u s i n g a Park site 41VV84 as an
example. Unfortunately, the report concentrates on the method
and the r e s u l t s are only s u m m a r i l y reported. Taylor a l s o attempted to order the c u l t u r a l s e q u e n c e of the r e g i o n in the
context of s i m i l a r efforts in the Big Bend r e g i o n to the west.
This then was the b a c k g r o u n d for S u h m , K r i e g e r and J e l k s
(1954) summary of the Lower Pecos c u l t u r a l s e q u e n c e as the
southeastern area of the T r a n s - P e c o s .
The late 1950's and 1960 r s were a p e r i o d of i n t e n s e
a c t i v i t y , h a s t e n e d by the p e n d i n g c o n s t r u c t i o n of the A m i s t a d

that t h i s was a p e r i o d devoted to c h r o n o l o g y b u i l d i n g ; more
than that, t h i s time saw the first broad area! surveys i n t e n d e d
to evaluate and select sites for further study (Graham and
D a v i s n.d., 1958; Parsons n . d . , 1962; D i b b l e and Prewitt 1967),
the systematic e x c a v a t i o n of numerous s h e l t e r s and b u r i e d
terrace sites (Alexander 1970; C o l l i n s 1969; D i b b l e 1965,
1967; E p s t e i n 1960, 1963; Johnson 1961, 1964. 1967 ;
McClurkan 1968; Nunley, Duffield and Jelks 1965; Parsons 1965;
Prewitt 1966, 1970; Ross 1965; Sorrow 1968), the i n c e p t i o n
of p a l e o e n v i r o n m e n t a l s t u d i e s (Story and Bryant 1966; D i b b l e
and Lorrain 1968) and the a p p l i c a t i o n of the a n t h r o p o l o g i c a l
or art h i s t o r i c a l approaches to the study of rock art (Gebhard 1960, 1965; Grieder 1965, 1966).
The thrust of the i n t e n s i v e s a l v a g e o p e r a t i o n s was by
d e f i n i t i o n confined to areas to be i n u n d a t e d by the R e s e r v o i r .
P e r i p h e r a l areas such as the Park were i n c l u d e d in some p h a s e s ;
most p e r t i n e n t were the p r e l i m i n a r y inventory by Graham and
Davis (1958), a more concentrated survey effort by Parsons
(1962, n.d.) and the rock art s t u d i e s of G e b h a r d (1960, 1965).
In 1960, a r e l a t i v e chronology of the rock art was proposed by G e b h a r d based on the s u p e r i m p o s i t i o n of f i g u r e s
w i t h i n a panel and on stylistic s i m i l a r i t i e s . T h i s prel i m i n a r y study was later refined into a type and phase sequence
based l a r g e l y on t h i r t e e n sites now w i t h i n or c l o s e to the
Park. H i s s a m p l e of p i c t o g r a p h s had been e n l a r g e d as a result
of a d d i t i o n a l survey of the area s p e c i f i c a l l y oriented toward
the r e c o r d i n g of rock art (Parson n . d . , 1962). In 1962,
Texas Archeol ogi cal Salvage. Project a r c h e o l o g i s t s recorded
n i n e a d d i t i o n a l sites on S e m i n o l e and Presa canyons; five
c o n t a i n e d rock art, four of w h i c h had been drawn by K i r k l a n d
(41VV201, 217, 226, and 230). G e b h a r d ' s (1965) f i n a l report
proposed a t y p o l o g i c a l framework ordered c h r o n o l o g i c a l l y and
s u b d i v i d e d into phases based on style and super i m p o s i t i o n s
of figures. He then analyzed the p i c t o g r a p h s w i t h i n each
s i t e , a s s i g n i n g them to these categories. Of most interest
to t h i s study are sites 41VV72-77, 83, 201, 212, and 217.
P h o t o g r a p h s and l i n e d r a w i n g s of all p e r t i n e n t p a n e l s were
made and p r o v i d e the most c o m p l e t e d o c u m e n t a t i o n of these
sites from t h i s period of i n v e s t i g a t i o n . T h u s , c o m p a r a t i v e

U n f o r t u n a t e l y , G e b h a r d ' s f i n a l study is an u n c i r c u l a t e d

In 1967, N e w c o m b ' s c o m p i l a t i o n and a n t h r o p o l o g i c a l
study of K i r k l a n d ' s water colors was p u b l i s h e d by the U n i v e r s i t y of Texas Press. The c l a s s i f i c a t i o n system employed
t h r o u g h o u t t h i s report is Newcomb's; his i n t e r p r e t a t i o n is
preferred because this we!1-i11ustrated volume is more r e a d i l y
a v a i l a b l e for reference and because his c l a r i t y seems a p p r o p r i a t e to the l e v e l of i n f o r m a t i o n .
Newcomb defines two major classes of prehistoric art in
the Lower Pecos and both are c h r o n o l o g i c a l l y d i s t i n c t . The
earlier Pecos R i v e r Style is d i v i d e d into four p h a s e s based
on the e v o l u t i o n of a dominant motif, the shaman f i g u r e , and
is e q u i v a l e n t to G e b h a r d ' s Types 1 and 2 (Table 1). N e w c o m b ' s
later Red M o n o c h r o m e style is G e b h a r d ' s Late Red F i g u r e Style.
A d d i t i o n a l l y , two less frequent styles are pertinent to the
rock art found in the Park - the Red Linear and P a i n t e d P e b b l e
styles, neither of w h i c h were w e l l represented in the recorded
rock art at the time of these prior analyses. The brief summary of c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of each of the p i c t o g r a p h styles then
relies upon two p r i m a r y sources - Gebhard (1965) and N e w c o m b
( K i r k l a n d and Newcomb 1967) - both of w h i c h are based on only
selected s a m p l e s of the r e m n a n t u n i v e r s e of Lower Pecos rock
art.

As part of the A m i s t a d s a l v a g e o p e r a t i o n s , test excav a t i o n s were carried out at two sites now w i t h i n the Park Fate Bell Shelter (Parsons 1965) and Black Cave (Parsons 1962).
At the former s i t e , the objective was to a s c e r t a i n if any
intact c u l t u r a l d e p o s i t s had e l u d e d the d e t e r m i n e d efforts of
decades of relic hunters. Two test pits were created by
s q u a r i n g the w a l l s of pot holes to expose c l e a n p r o f i l e s and
a t h i r d u n i t , 3 x 8 ft., w a s e x c a v a t e d . Even t h e latter w a s
affected by looters' who collected from the unattended u n i t
d u r i n g the f i e l d e x c a v a t i o n s (Parsons 1965: 10). T h i s l i m i t e d
t e s t i n g , in the o p i n i o n of the excavators, confirmed the
integrity of some of the deposits, especially at the lower
depths. The f e a s i b i l i t y of more e x t e n s i v e e x c a v a t i o n s w h i c h
were recommended at that time are d i s c u s s e d in the Recommendations (see pp. 183-184).
Test excavations at Black Cave (41VV76) were prompted by
the l a n d o w n e r ' s report of metal arrow p o i n t s recovered from
the site. A l t h o u g h the shelter deposits were greatly eroded
by recent floods, the p o s s i b i l i t y that e v i d e n c e for a historic
a b o r i g i n a l component m i g h t be recovered was e x p l o r e d . The
one test p i t , 5 x 5 ft., was opened to a d e p t h of 2 ft.; only
a few specimens of M i d d l e and Late Archaic dart p o i n t styles
were recovered. The e x c a v a t o r s c o n c l u d e d t h a t ' m o s t of the
recent d e p o s i t s had been destroyed by the 1954 flood and t h e i r
sole recommendation was a suggestion to further investigate
old floor remnants cemented to the w a l l of the s h e l t e r (see
pp. 73-77).
Since the cessation of the Amistad S a l v a g e Project, the
pace of a r c h e o l o g i c a l i n v e s t i g a t i o n has slowed; a p e r c e p t i b l e
s h i f t in o r i e n t a t i o n occurred in the 1970's. The e c o l o g i c a l
approach, which dominated American archeology as a whole during
t h i s time, had been a p p l i e d to p r e v i o u s work in the Lower Pecos
(e.g. Story and Bryant 1966) but reached its clima'x in the
National Science Foundation supported work of Texas A & M
U n i v e r s i t y (TAMU) at H i n d s Cave, north of the current study area
(Shafer and others 1975; Shafer and Bryant 1977). A l e x a n d e r
(1974) and M a r m a d u k e (1978) had attempted to a p p l y an environmental approach to d e l i n e a t e change; the perspective of the
H i n d s Cave study was to d e r i v e from e n v i r o n m e n t a l data an e x p l a n atory model for s t a b i l i t y . W i t h the e x c e p t i o n of some of the TAMU
analyses (Andrews and Adovasio 1980; Shafer and Bryant 1977) and
s m a l l area surveys (Prewitt and D i b b l e 1974; M a r m a d u k e and
Whitsett 1975; M c N a t t 1981), the majority of the work reported
from the Lower Pecos in the last decade has been in the form of
d i s s e r t a t i o n s (Maslowski 1978; C o l l i n s 1974; M a r m a d u k e 1978;
W i l l i a m s - D e a n 1978; A l e x a n d e r 1974; Lord n.d.); masters theses
(Dering 1979; Chadderton 1981); or i n d i v i d u a l articles (Shafer
1975, 1976, 1977, 1980, 1981; T u r p i n and others 1979; Patton and
D i b b l e 1982; Kochel and Baker 1982).
Concurrent with the field work for this report, the Texas
Department of P u b l i c Safety, D i v i s i o n of Highway Design, undertook the reconstruction of a h i s t o r i c s i t e , 41VV580, m o v i n g a

The current l e v e l of u n d e r s t a n d i n g of the span of human
o c c u p a t i o n of the Lower Pecos, a l t h o u g h somewhat s u p e r i o r to
many other areas of Texas, can only be g e n e r a l i z e d to accomodate the prehistoric rock art. The chronology of s h e l t e r
o c c u p a t i o n s is w e l l corroborated strati g r a p h i c a l l y and by
radiocarbon assays but the r e l a t i o n s h i p of rock art to those
h a b i t a t i o n s is based almost solely on s u b j e c t i v e and r e l a t i v e
styli stic criteria.
Chronology of P r e h i s t o r i c O c c u p a t i o n of the Lower Pecos
A refined c h r o n o l o g y of p r e h i s t o r i c o c c u p a t i o n of the
Lower Pecos has been e s t a b l i s h e d by the e x c a v a t i o n s of numerous
rock s h e l t e r s and b u r i e d terrace sites. Two systems of nom e n c l a t u r e are in c u r r e n t u s a g e (Table 2). The more t r a d i tional d i v i d e s the regional prehistory into Late P a l e o i n d i a n ,
A r c h a i c and Late P r e h i s t o r i c (or N e o - A m e r i c a n ) p e r i o d s . The
A r c h a i c Period s u b s u m e s Early, M i d d l e a n d Late s u b d i v i s i o n s .
The second system proposes a per t o d i z a t i o n based on t i m e diagnostic artifacts corroborated by radiocarbon dates and
strati g r a p h i c a s s o c i a t i o n s (Story 1966; C o l l i n s 1974). The
advantage of the latter l i e s in the a v o i d a n c e of a m b i g u i t y
between d i s c r e t e p e r i o d s of time and the i m p l i e d c u l t u r a l
stages of d e v e l o p m e n t . The former, however, w i l l be
used t h r o u g h o u t t h i s text because the c h r o n o l o g y of the rock
art, a major focus of t h i s study, is at best poorly d e v e l o p e d
and the a s s i g n m e n t to a more s p e c i f i c time period m i g h t erroneously i m p l y more secure contextual d a t i n g . A d d i t i o n a l l y ,
Newcomb's a n a l y s i s (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967), the one r e l i e d
upon most for the project b a c k g r o u n d , is set w i t h i n the
framework of A r c h a i c and Late P r e h i s t o r i c . F i n a l l y , the
t i m e - d i a g n o s t i c s recorded d u r i n g the survey are a l l s u r f i c i a l
f i n d s , often i d e n t i f i e d in the f i e l d and left i n p l a c e . Site
a s s i g n m e n t s are to a g e n e r a l t i m e - s p a n p r e d i c a t e d on one or
two projectile point styles a n d , u n t i l more d e f i n i t i v e c o l l e c t i o n s are m a d e , the generalized framework seems a p p r o p r i a t e
to the level of the data acquired.
The time d i a g n o s t i c s and their r e l a t i o n s h i p s to the
various periods shown in Table 2 are, with the exception off
the Infierno m a t e r i a l s , based on r a d i o c a r b o n assays from
Arenosa Shelter ( D i b b l e 1967; Valastro, Pearson and D a v i s 1967;
V a l a s t r o and D a v i s 1970a, 1970b; V a l a s t r o , D a v i s and Varela
1977), Bonfire Shelter ( D i b b l e 1965; D i b b l e and Lorrain 1968;

(Ross 1965) and the D e v i l ' s M o u t h S i t e (Sorrow 1968). The
d i v i s i o n between t h e Early a n d M i d d l e A r c h a i c p e r i o d s is

and Late Archaic is conversely dependent upon the types such
as M0n-£e££ and CaAtiov-llle. dart points considered to represent a relatively sudden c h a n g e in subsistence patterns.
LATE P A L E O I N D I A N

PERIOD

At present, the e a r l i e s t known o c c u p a t i o n of the r e g i o n
has been w e l 1 - d o c u m e n t e d at Bonfire Shelter (41VV218) where
Fo£4om and P£a-cnvlew projectile points were found in association with extinct bison bone. This strata was radiocarbon
dated at 10,230 years ago (Dibble 1965; D i b b l e and Lorrain
1968; D i b b l e 1970). S l i g h t l y later temporal diagnostics,
such as Gotovid>t<ivia. dart p o i n t s , were recovered at two sites,
the D e v i l s Mouth (41VV188) (Johnson 1964) and Baker Cave
(Word and D o u g l a s 1970; Hester 1980; C h a d d e r t o n 1981), in deposits d a t a b l e to a p p r o x i m a t e l y 7000 years ago. No e v i d e n c e
for the b i g - g a m e economy c o n s i d e r e d an i n t e g r a l trait of the
P a l e o i n d i a n s u b s i s t e n c e was found at the later sites but the
data from Bonfire Shelter confirmed the presence of paleovenatic peoples in the area 10,000 years ago.
A R C H A I C PERIOD

By far the preponderance of the archeological m a t e r i a l s
analyzed from a l l the e x c a v a t i o n s in the A m i s t a d R e g i o n can
be a s s i g n e d to this p e r i o d . The A r c h a i c 1ifeways reflected
in the shelter deposits are t r a d i t i o n a l l y v i e w e d as those of
small b a n d , n o m a d i c hunters and gatherers w i t h a h i g h l y a d a p ted yet l i m i t e d technology. S u b d i v i s i o n s w i t h i n the A r c h a i c
are based on c h a n g e s in projectile point m o r p h o l o g y . S l i g h t
subsistence changes, restricted to shifts in emphasis on
a v a i l a b l e plants and a n i m a l s , have been detected in the shelter
deposits (Word and Douglas 1970; Alexander 1974; Dering 1979;
Lord n . d .) . The increased u t i l i z a t i o n of u p l a n d resources
through time is also proposed as a response to p o p u l a t i o n
growth or i n c r e a s i n g m a r g i n a l i t y of the resource base (Alexander
1974; M a r m a d u k e 1978). However, the o v e r r i d i n g theme of
s t a b i l i t y permeates t h e a r c h e o l o g i c a l l i t e r a t u r e concerned
w i t h this period a n d h a s l a r g e l y i n f l u e n c e d proposed m o d e l s
of the p r e h i s t o r i c c u l t u r a l systems. The general consensus of
most of the a r c h e o l o g i s t s , at l e a s t as presented in their p u b l l i s h e d reports, is summarized by Newcomb:
However described t e r m i n o l o g i c a l 1 y , it was a selfcontained, i n w a r d - l o o k i n g tradition, anciently
adapted and committed to a relatively static existence
in an u n c h a n g i n g world. Introduction of the bow and
arrow, sometime between A.D. 600-1000, presaged a
quickening of cultural change, possibly population
m o v e m e n t s and end of the o l d t r a d i t i o n as s u c h . But

Period is based on the d e p i c t i o n of the bow and arrow
rather than the dart and a t l a t l so common in the Pecos R i v e r

The mechanisms of a l t e r a t i o n in projectile point size

on the l e v e l of the study of the i n t r u s i o n of the b i s o n

the a r c h e o l o g i c a l d e p o s i t s is best v i e w e d as an effective
tool for p e r i o d i z a t i o n of the c h r o n o l o g y , and not as i n d i c a tive of the end of the Archaic lifeways. G i v e n that interpretation, no v a l i d objection can be raised a g a i n s t the

HISTORIC PERIOD

TPWD has c o m p i l e d a narrative history of the area surr o u n d i n g the Park b e g i n n i n g with the e a r l i e s t S p a n i s h
contacts and c a r r y i n g t h r o u g h the r a i l r o a d era (Dolman 1980).
The e x p e d i t i o n of deSosa i n 1590 a p p a r e n t l y crossed Presa
and S e m i n o l e canyons (Schroeder and Matson 1965: 41, Map 2)
but t h i s short foray left no i d e n t i f i a b l e mark u p o n the
Park. The I n d i a n v i e w of the white c o l o n i s t s is v i v i d l y
expressed at Vaquero Shelter (41VV77) in upper Presa. Canyon
but the scene portrayed is a permanent s e t t l e m e n t o u t s i d e
the Lower Pecos r e g i o n .
The A m e r i c a n p e n e t r a t i o n of the r e g i o n , p r o m p t e d by the
need for trade and m i l i t a r y routes began in earnest in the
mid-1800's. The U n i t e d States-Mexico B o u n d a r y Survey prov i d e d m u c h of the i n f o r m a t i o n necessary to map the region
(Emory 1857). Pacification attempts through the third-quarter
of the n i n e t e e n t h century c u l m i n a t e d in 1880 in the establ i s h m e n t of a m i l i t a r y road from the D e v i l s R i v e r to a

STYLE

The most a n c i e n t art of the Lower Pecos is a l s o the
most p r e v a l e n t . Somber in theme and v i v i d in c o l o r a t i o n ,
these p o l y c h r o m e p a n e l s are found in every rock art site in
the Park except 41VV72, 201, and 408. The c e n t r a l m o t i f is
anthropomorphic or costumed human figures, often of towering

of the Pecos R i v e r style as r e l i g i o u s or c e r e m o n i a l art.
Rare instances of humor detract l i t t l e from the dominant,
o v e r - r i d i n g formality of the style.
The predominance of the shaman theme is one of v i s u a l
i m p a c t ; numerous other forms are present, often in m i n i a t u r e
form. Any v i v a c i t y found is restricted to the latter.
Striped a n d s o l i d deer, b i r d s , f i s h , t u r t l e s , a n d e n i g m a t i c
geometric forms are common; only the panther assumes an
a n i m a l i s t i c stature on a par with the shaman.
The age and span of the Pecos R i v e r Style is undefined.
Only a general corollary with the A r c h a i c Period can be assumed from the s i m i l a r i t y of p a i n t e d objects to those found
in the a r c h e o l o g i c a l d e p o s i t s - a t l a t l , dart, and p r i c k l y
pear p o u c h e s . The s o p h i s t i c a t i o n and c o m p l e x i t y of the
pictographs, and the internal e v o l u t i o n of style, are seen
as evidence for great a n t i q u i t y and a long d e v e l o p m e n t a l
span (.Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 60). The differences in
p r e s e r v a t i o n between different styles prompted G e b h a r d (1965:
119) to s p e c u l a t e on a span of 2500 to 3000 years for the
rock art of the Lower Pecos as a w h o l e . As noted by both,
their estimates are based on inference and not substantiated
by any absolute e v i d e n c e . U n t i l further i n v e s t i g a t i o n s prov i d e a d d i t i o n a l temporal c o n t r o l s , general A r c h a i c a f f i l i a t i o n
is the most d e f i n i t i v e statement that can be m a d e .
Newcomb d e f i n e d four p e r i o d s w i t h i n t h e Pecos R i v e r
Style based on i n c r e a s i n g s t y l i z a t i o n of the s h a m a n m o t i f
through time. Seen as a transition from c o m p l e x i t y in design to an abstraction in w h i c h symbols conveyed the concept
of objects, these periods signify an i n t e r n a l e v o l u t i o n .
I m p l i e d is a c u l t u r a l c o n e s i v e n e s s by w h i c h the m e a n i n g of
the a b s t r a c t i o n was a c o n v e n t i o n understood by the s o c i a l
u n i t . Thus darts became p r o j e c t i l e p o i n t s , feet, h a n d s , a r m s ,
and legs are omitted, and geometric forms u n i n t e l l i g i b l e to
us are so repetitive that an ideogram is i m p l i e d .
Gebhard (1965: 9-10) sees a reduction in scale t h r o u g h
time and a tendency toward a b s t r a c t i o n , w h e r e i n a dart becomes
a s l a s h e d l i n e , and w h i c h c u l m i n a t e s i n the h u m a n f i g u r e
r i t u a l i z e d into a geometric p a t t e r n . The r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s
of deer shot w i t h darts are seen as a late emergence.
It s h o u l d be noted that w h i l e both Gebhard and Newcomb
p e r c e i v e a s i m i l a r trend t h r o u g h time, their periods and
p h a s e s a r e o n l y r o u g h l y e q u i v a l e n t a n d n e i t h e r a r e based i n
a f i n i t e c h r o n o l o g y . One a s s u m p t i o n can be m a d e w i t h some
security. By the time of the Red M o n o c h r o m e Style, the Pecos
R i v e r Style had run its separate course. It may be, however,
that its remnant splendor, by e x a m p l e , prompted i m i t a t i o n ,
much as it seems today to i n v i t e the 1 e s s - t h a n - a r t i s t i c
a t t e n t i o n of modern s c r i b e s . The r e s u l t was the e x p r e s s i o n

RED M O N O C H R O M E STYLE

O r i g i n a l l y c a l l e d by K i r k l a n d (1938: 20), the " V a l V e r d e
Flooded Shelter Style", Red Monochrome is the latest defined
style in the r e g i o n . Only three major p a n e l s are known 41VV72 in u p p e r S e m i n o l e Canyon (Fig. 4), 41VV78 in nearby
P a i n t e d Canyon, and one site in M e x i c o . Few in number and
d e c i d e d l y different from the e a r l i e r styles, these s o l i d red
murals are dated to the Late Prehistoric Period by the graphic a l l y d e p i c t e d bow and arrow.
Characteristics which differentiate Red Monochrome from
the Pecos R i v e r Style are the l a c k of o r n a m e n t a t i o n , the
c o m p o s i t i o n of m u r a l s in horizontal bands of h u m a n f i g u r e s
a c c o m p a n i e d by n a t u r a l i s t i c a n i m a l s of n u m e r o u s s p e c i e s , the
frontal posture w i t h arms raised and l e g s s p r e a d , and the
o c c a s i o n a l d i s p l a y o f m a l e g e n i t a l s . More s u b t l y , t h e figures
are not endowed w i t h s u p e r n a t u r a l q u a l i t i e s , and seem l i f e l i k e portraits of a band. As is i m p l i e d by the name, all
the f i g u r e s are of r e d d i s h h u e . The m e n t i o n of b l a c k monochrome figures by Graham and Davis and Gebhard has not been
s u b s t a n t i a t e d ( K i r k l a n d and Newcomb 1967: 81).
The s u d d e n e m e r g e n c e of a f u l l y d e v e l o p e d art style at
a l a t e time i n p r e h i s t o r y has led to the c o n c l u s i o n that the
Red Monochrome a r t i s t s were i n t r u s i v e into the r e g i o n ; their
rarity and i n t e r n a l s i m i l a r i t i e s are seen as an i n d i c a t i o n
of the r e l a t i v e l y brief span of t h i s i n c u r s i o n ( K i r k l a n d and
Newcomb 1967 : 89).
G e b h a r d (1965: 36) who s u b s u m e s the Red M o n o c h r o m e s u n d e r
his Type 5, Late Red Figure Style, suggests that this intrus i v e art has a f f i n i t i e s w i t h western modes of d e p i c t i n g the
h u m a n f i g u r e in p r o t o - h i s t o r i c or early historic times.
Among the n a t u r a l i s t i c a n i m a l s portrayed, one deer at 41VV78
is drawn w i t h i n t e r n a l organs connected to its outstretched
t o n g u e with a l i n e . Newcomb ( K i r k l a n d and Newcomb 1967: 84)
i n t e r p r e t s t h i s as a heart l i n e , a common m o t i f in N o r t h
American art, and he cites Schaafsma's s u g g e s t i o n that this
trait is of A t h a p a s c a n i m p o r t , e i t h e r d e v e l o p e d or adopted
from P l a i n s groups. The latter is of some interest in the
l i g h t of the e m e r g i n g e v i d e n c e for an i n t r u s i o n of A t h a p a s k a n
speakers into the r e g i o n very late in prehistory (see 41VV446,

The most salient characteristic of the Red Linear style
is the graceful a n i m a t i o n and c o n t a g i o u s v i t a l i t y conveyed by
the m i n i a t u r e stick f i g u r e s . In both e x a m p l e s of t h i s style

are e n e r g e t i c a l l y engaged in g r o u p a c t i v i t i e s (Fig. 5).
F l u i d l y abstract y e t v i s u a l l y c o h e s i v e , these s m a l l r e d
figures are i n marked contrast to the s t a t i c , sometimes somber
Pecos R i v e r s h a m a n s , but both styles may be c o n t e m p o r a n e o u s

s i m i l a r i t i e s and on the d e p i c t i o n of the a t l a t l , the Red

s o l e l y on the c o m p o s i t i o n at 41VV201 where the theme is
d e c i d e d l y s e x u a l . That this is the d o m i n a n t topic of the
Red L i n e a r style (Gebhard 1965: 3; K i r k l a n d and Newcomb 1967:
93) is not borne out at Fate B e l l S h e l t e r where a g r o u p of
s m a l l red f i g u r e s wends i t s . way across the 1 e d g i n g of the

PRESENT VIEWS

p e b b l e s so common in the s h e l t e r d e p o s i t s . In his refined
t y p o l o g y , Gebhard (1965: 26-28) p l a c e d this style in his Type
3, Late Pecos Style, Phase 2, and enlarged it to i n c l u d e
several b o x - s h a p e d h u m a n figures (Fig. 6a) and geometric
forms found in his s a m p l e of sites in the S e m i n o l e Canyon
area. G i v e n t h i s new d e f i n i t i o n of the style, the name is
p e r h a p s unfortunate as it i m p l i e s a generic r e l a t i o n s h i p between these p i c t o g r a p h s and the p e b b l e s w h i c h has not been
d e m o n s t r a t e d . The r e a l i t y of t h i s t y p o l o g i c a l d i v i s i o n is
a matter for broader s c a l e study; the d e f i n i t i o n can not be
tested u s i n g the same data from S e m i n o l e Canyon from w h i c h
it was d e r i v e d .
M i s c e l l a n e o u s Red F i g u r e Styles
Under the general category Type 5, Late Red F i g u r e s ,
Gebhard (1965: 37-39) i n c l u d e s m i s c e l l a n e o u s d r a w i n g s at
several sites in the Park. H i s Phase 2, Red L i n e Style,
seen at Fate B e l l S h e l t e r , is l i k e the Red M o n o c h r o m e , cons i d e r e d an i n t r u s i v e form. The most s t r i k i n g e x a m p l e of his
Phase 3, M i s c e l l a n e o u s is the dark red s h i e l d f i g u r e in Fate
B e l l Annex (Fig. 6b) w h i c h he sees as of very l a t e date and
perhaps a f f i l i a t e d w i t h s i m i l a r motifs from t h e P l a i n s .
HISTORIC P E R I O D ROCK ART

U n l i k e the previous classifications by stylistic criteria,
this category is a c h r o n o l o g i c a l c a t c h - a l l for a b o r i g i n a l art

METHODS AND TECHNIQUES
ACQUISITION OF PRIOR ROCK ART DOCUMENTATION

In order to assess the rates of rock art deterioration,
c o m p a r i s o n w i t h r e p r o d u c t i o n s made over the last f i v e decades
was e s s e n t i a l . The scattered d i s t r i b u t i o n of sources was
traced and, when feasible, copies were a c q u i r e d . The m a i n
repositories are the Texas A r c h e o l o g i c a l Research Laboratory,
the Texas A r c h e o l o g i c a l Survey, the Barker Texas History
Center, and the Texas Memorial Museum, (all at the University
of Texas at Austin), and the Witte M u s e u m . I n d i v i d u a l ' s
collections of photographs studied are those of Dr. David
Gebhard of the U n i v e r s i t y of C a l i f o r n i a at Santa Barbara,
Dr. Terence Grieder and Dr. W i l l i a m W. Newcomb of the
U n i v e r s i t y of Texas at A u s t i n . More s p e c i f i c i n f o r m a t i o n

in A p p e n d i x I I I .
Gutzeit and Carson's 1931 water colors are a v a i l a b l e
for study in the W i t t e M u s e u m in San Antonio. Color s l i d e s
of the o r i g i n a l work are o b t a i n a b l e through the Witte but

The works, notes and p h o t o g r a p h s of Mr. and Mrs. Forrest
K i r k l a n d are stored in the Texas Memorial Museum (TMM), The
U n i v e r s i t y of Texas at A u s t i n . Jackson's p h o t o g r a p h s and

Laboratory (TARL), his notebooks and other m e m o r a b i l i a at the
Barker Texas History Center. A d d i t i o n a l l y , TARL and TAS records
of site forms and notes of l a t e r projects were h e a v i l y u t i l i z i e d .
Numerous color 35 mm. s l i d e s , taken by Graham and D a v i s in 1958
and Parsons in the 1960's, are stored at TMM. D a v i d G e b h a r d
loaned his b l a c k and white and color transparencies from his
1960's s t u d i e s for r e p r o d u c t i o n . Those of sites w i t h i n the Park
were c o p i e d for TPWD by TAS and are on f i l e at TMM. The r e m a i n der were acquired by the University and are retained at TARL.
A l t h o u g h S e m i n o l e Canyon was o u t s i d e his major area of study,

Panther and Red L i n e a r s i t e s taken in 1962. Many of the
recent photographs i l l u s t r a t e d in this report were taken by
David S. D i b b l e , the Principal Investigator.
Of the m a t e r i a l s generated by t h i s project, all rock art

METHODS OF ROCK ART R E C O R D I N G

D u r i n g 1979, TAS and Dennett, Muessig and Associates,
Ltd. of Iowa City conducted an e x p e r i m e n t in a r c h e o l o g i c a l
s i t e m a p p i n g w i t h s t e r e o p h o t o g r a m m e t r y (Turpin a n d others
1979), a p r e c i s e t e c h n i q u e used in a r c h i t e c t u r e and e n g i n e e r i n g . Two sites were thus m a p p e d , one, a rock art s i t e ,
41VV78.
In t h i s process, o v e r l a p p i n g p h o t o g r a p h s taken perp e n d i c u l a r to a common base l i n e are used to construct a
t h r e e - d i m e n s i o n a l o p t i c a l model from w h i c h accurate measurements can be made. The images created on f i l m , w h e n mounted
in a plotter, are s i m i l a r to three d i m e n s i o n a l m o d e l s seen
through a stereoscope. W h e n scaled u s i n g a measured d i s t a n c e
or the known d i m e n s i o n s of any object w i t h i n the s t e r e o p a i r s ,
an accurate map or p l o t of any of the features portrayed can
be p r o d u c e d .
T h e e q u i p m e n t used i n that e x p e r i m e n t w a s W i l d H e e r b r u g g
fixed base cameras - the C-120 and the C-40.
Two w i d e a n g l e
stereometric cameras are m o u n t e d on a p e r m a n e n t base bar w i t h
their axes p a r a l l e l and p e r p e n d i c u l a r to the base. Both are
operated from t e l e s c o p i c t r i p o d s w h i c h can be extended to a
h e i g h t of 2.6 m. For the d o c u m e n t a t i o n of the S e m i n o l e Canyon
rock art, a t h i r d camera was a l s o used. The P - 3 2 is a s i n g l e
m e t r i c camera operated from a t h e o d o l i t e w h i c h is used to estab l i s h a m e a s u r e d base l i n e . All p l o t s were produced on an
A-40 A u t o g r a p h plotter.
Two months were expended in the documentation of the major
rock art sites in the Park (Table 3). In A p r i l - M a y 1980, Sarah
Dennett and Hans M u e s s i g , a s s i s t e d by two to four TAS crew
m e m b e r s , recorded Fate B e l l A n n e x , Fate Bell S h e l t e r , V a q u e r o
Shelter, part of B l a c k Cave, and e x p e r i m e n t e d with 41VV72.
This month was a d m i t t e d l y a p e r i o d of trial and error, and w h e n
the m a g n i t u d e of the task, c o m p l i c a t e d by camera shutter m a l functions, became apparent, the crew w i t h d r e w to regroup. In
A p r i l - M a y 1981, Sarah Dennett and Bob Ryan r e t u r n e d , and w i t h
c e r t a i n m o d i f i c a t i o n s p l u s e x p e r i e n c e g a i n e d t h e p r e v i o u s year,
r a p i d l y c o m p l e t e d B l a c k C a v e , Panther C a v e , R e d L i n e a r , a n d
selected retakes of shots at Fate Bell Shelter.
The b a s i c procedure, in its f i n a l stages of r e f i n e m e n t ,
c o n s i s t e d of e s t a b l i s h i n g camera p o i n t s on l i n e s p a r a l l e l to
the rock art p a n e l s so that o v e r l a p p i n g c o v e r a g e was i n s u r e d .
The exact l o c a t i o n of each p o i n t on t h i s cord, and of i s o l a t e d
s t a t i o n s p l a c e d for a d d i t i o n a l c o v e r a g e , was surveyed by theod o l i t e u s i n g brass caps i n s t a l l e d by TPWD as p e r m a n e n t d a t u m .
T i e - i n points and camera a i m i n g points were affixed to the
s h e l t e r w a l l s w i t h a d h e s i v e tape, a n d t h e i r l o c a t i o n s m a p p e d .
Sketch maps i n d i c a t i n g the camera s t a t i o n s are i n c l u d e d in the

the type of f i l m , the shutter speed and settings, the a n g l e and
p o s i t i o n of the camera, and the camera used were recorded.

From these m a p p e d l o c a t i o n s , four d u p l i c a t e sets of
s t e r e o p a i r s were m a d e - two in color and two in b l a c k and
w h i t e . The b l a c k and w h i t e f i l m was Agfa Gervaert 6x9 cm.
g l a s s p l a t e s ; color f i l m was cut from Kodachrome 4x5 sheets
to fit the 6x9 format. Commonly, l a r g e figures extend from
floor to c e i l i n g ; to incorporate the entire d e s i g n , stereopairs were taken at v a r i o u s a s c e n d i n g a n g l e s from the same
station. Stereopairs are referenced by their station w i t h i n
the site, thus PC 15 U is the u p p e r frames taken in Panther
Cave from station 15.
A d d i t i o n a l l y , where p o s s i b l e , camera set-ups across the
canyon were used to plot the o v e r a l l c o n f i g u r a t i o n of the
shelters. The reservoir and c h a i n - l i n k fence at Panther
Cave precluded long shots and v e g e t a t i o n obscures the field
of v i e w at B l a c k Cave. B l u e l i n e s of plots of Fate B e l l and
Fate Bell Annex were used as f i e l d maps for a d d i t i o n of rock
art panel p o s i t i o n s not v i s i b l e from these stations.
A s t a d i a rod was i n c l u d e d in every shot as a scale. A
c o l o r control c h e c k e r was either taped to the wall or to the
s t a d i a rod for later d e t e c t i o n of f a d i n g or a l t e r a t i o n in the
r e p r o d u c t i o n of these colors.
S e l e c t e d p a n e l s in all major rock art sites were plotted
and are stored at the Texas M e m o r i a l Museum. A d i s t i n c t i o n

m u s t be made between t h i s type of p l o t t i n g and an a r t i s t ' s
measured d r a w i n g s . T h e plots d e l i n e a t e t h e a c t u a l d i s t r i b u t i o n of remnant p a i n t on a three-dimensional surface, thus
reflect i r r e g u l a r i t i e s of the l i m e s t o n e surface, f a d i n g and
s p e l l i n g . The h u m a n eye, on the other h a n d , c o m p e n s a t e s for
v a g a r i e s in a known symbol and translates the c o n f i g u r a t i o n
of the p a i n t e d object into a form a c c e p t a b l e to the c u l t u r a l
v o c a b u l a r y of the i n d i v i d u a l . Nowhere was t h i s more g r a p h i c
than the h a n d p r i n t at Vaquero Shelter (Fig. 7). To the eye,
it is a perfectly formed h u m a n h a n d ; the plotted d e l i n e a t i o n
seems m a l f o r m e d . To our s u r p r i s e , the actual h a n d p r i n t is as
plotted but not as p e r c e i v e d . One wonders then how often
p e r c e p t i o n i n t e r v e n e s in i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s of the symbols of
this long past c u l t u r e .
S i m u l t a n e o u s l y w i t h the stereophotogrammetry, 35 mm.
c o l o r coverage was taken. B l a c k and w h i t e 35 mm. was used
to document the field procedures, but as the crew was often
f u l l y o c c u p i e d , t h i s coverage is spotty.
At each s i t e , the TAS f i e l d crew attempted to characterize the evidence for deterioration and propose p r o b a b l e
c a u s e s . S a m p l e s for s p e c i a l analyses were l a r g e l y c o l l e c t e d
at t h i s time.

composition was p o s s i b l e , samples were then collected w i t h
s p e c i f i c q u e s t i o n s in m i n d . For e x a m p l e , is there a b a s i c
difference between u n d e r p a i n t e d and o v e r p a i n t e d p a n e l s ? It
now seems f e a s i b l e to detect stratigraphy in the p a i n t i n g s
w i t h i n a g i v e n site. It may a l s o be p o s s i b l e to test intersite c o m p a r i s o n s of p i g m e n t on s t y l i s t i c a l l y s i m i l a r p a i n t i n g s
to determine if they were contemporaneously drawn.
Speculation on the constituents of the pigments has
generally considered the reds as hematite, the yellow as
l i m o n i t e , the blacks as manganese d i o x i d e s or carbon (Jackson
1938; K i r k l a n d 1937; G e b h a r d 1965). A p p e n d i x II l i s t s the
constituents of each s a m p l e . It now seems that the composition is more complex than s i m p l e iron oxides forming the red
and yellow colors. A n a l y s i s of w h i t e p i g m e n t is s t i l l in
progress but at present the iron o x i d e s and gypsum are all
that have been detected.
The black samples are common manganese
d i o x i d e s . One specimen, b e l i e v e d to be carbon from smokeb l a c k e n i n g on the c e i l i n g of Fate Bell Shelter, also produced
manganese d i o x i d e patterns. The characteristic w a v e - l e n g t h of
carbon may be o v e r w h e l m e d by the more d i s t i n c t m a n g a n e s e o x i d e s .
However, in the future, some c a u t i o n s h o u l d be exercised in
d i f f e r e n t i a t i n g between smoke b l a c k e n i n g and common m i n e r a l
s t a i n i n g , e s p e c i a l l y if the d a t i n g of m i n u t e carbon s a m p l e s
becomes feasi ble .
THE A R C H E O L O G I C A L S U R V E Y

The a r c h e o l o g i c a 1 survey and r e e v a l u a t i o n of p r e v i o u s l y
recorded sites was c o n s i d e r e d as a n c i l l a r y to the d o c u m e n t a t i o n
of the rock art. Therefore, it was c a r r i e d out in three stages
of formality. D u r i n g the i n i t i a l photography in A p r i l 1980,
the P r i n c i p a l I n v e s t i g a t o r conducted a reconnaissance l e v e l
survey, either alone or accompanied by one of the field crew
who could be spared from the photography. Sites known to him
from previous work or located d u r i n g this time were flagged
and plotted on maps for l a t e r systematic r e c o r d i n g . S i m u l t a n e o u s l y , the f i e l d s u p e r v i s o r and any a v a i l a b l e crew m e m b e r
b e g a n the r e e v a l u a t i o n of p r e v i o u s l y recorded sites. New sites
noted d u r i n g this r e e v a l u a t i o n were s i m i l a r l y f l a g g e d or p l o t t e d
for further recording.
During the last week of A u g u s t 1980, a crew of four, this
author, Bruce N i g h t e n g a l e , James P l i s k a and Leland Bement,
systematically surveyed both banks of Presa Canyon and the
east bank of Seminole Canyon, recording sites in those areas
and others known from the r e c o n n a i s s a n c e . The method of survey
was dictated by the t o p o g r a p h y . The general pattern was to
space transects a l o n g contour l e v e l s w h i c h afforded a v i e w of
the t e r r a i n between the crew m e m b e r s . The m e a n d e r i n g canyon
often caused the crew to come together to cross t r i b u t a r i e s ,
only to spread out a g a i n on the next mesa. These broad noses

Likelyl o o k i n g overhangs on the opposite side of the canyons were
marked on the maps for later i n s p e c t i o n ; more often than not,
the rimrock s h e l t e r s are only v i s i b l e from the v a n t a g e p o i n t
of the o p p o s i t e s i d e .
The last week in September, 1980, Bruce N i g h t e n g a l e and
I returned to record sites not completed d u r i n g August, and
to continue the survey. Due to highway construction, we were
restricted to the west bank of Seminole Canyon. Much of this
f i e l d period was devoted to recording the numerous sites on
the i n t e r f l u v i a l flat just south of U.S. 90. This week ended
in the e x c a v a t i o n of C a i r n A, 41VV364, d e s c r i b e d on pages 146159.
Lee Bement and I returned in the last week of December
with the specific intention of relocating sites recorded
in 1962-68 which had not yet been reevaluated, and of invest i g a t i n g p r o m i s i n g locations p r e v i o u s l y marked on the maps.
In M a r c h , 1981, an a d d i t i o n a l three days were spent
p r e p a r i n g for the May f i e l d season, a c q u i r i n g p i g m e n t s a m p l e s
for s p e c i a l a n a l y s e s , and a u g m e n t i n g the r e c o r d i n g of sites
w i t h specific information.
The final stage of the survey was completed in conjunction w i t h photography done in May, 1981.
The portion of
Seminole Canyon inundated by the reservoir was surveyed by
boat. A l s o at t h i s time, the P r i n c i p a l I n v e s t i g a t o r and
the f i e l d s u p e r v i s o r v i s i t e d the newly recorded or relocated
sites to f o r m u l a t e the r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s . F i e l d c h e c k i n g of
the recorded sites c o n t i n u e d i n t e r m i t t e n t l y through A u g u s t
and September of 1981 .
The a r c h e o l o g i c a l survey was completely surficial; no
subsurface
p r o b i n g was done and very few artifacts were
c o l l e c t e d . Any e x c e p t i o n s to the latter p o l i c y are noted in
the s i t e d e s c r i p t i o n s , and j u s t i f i c a t i o n is p r o v i d e d . As a
r u l e , the only items removed from the Park were those so
o b v i o u s l y exposed that they were v u l n e r a b l e to c o l l e c t i o n or
those whose d i a g n o s t i c or comparative v a l u e was exceptional,
and some whose function was not d e t e r m i n a b l e in the f i e l d .
Artifacts removed from sites whose spatial patterning seemed
intact were photographed and returned to their o r i g i n a l
l o c a t i o n s w h i c h h a d been f l a g g e d i n t h e f i e l d . A l l r e t a i n e d
artifacts are curated at the Texas A r c h e o l o g i c a l Research
Laboratory, The U n i v e r s i t y of Texas at A u s t i n .
Documentation of sites consisted of recording on standard
University of Texas site survey forms, plotting on TPWD 1" =
200' aerial mosaics and USGS 7.5' q u a d r a n g l e maps, photography, and d r a w i n g s of d i a g n o s t i c artifacts. Copies of a l l
records are on f i l e at TPWD, TARL and the Texas H i s t o r i c a l
Commi ss i on .

the state (41=Texas), the two letters refer to the county
(VV=Val Verde), and the final d i g i t s theoretically sequence
the site's r e c o r d i n g in that county. In t h i s case, gaps in
the n u m e r i c a l s e q u e n c e in Val Verde County had resulted from
reservation of numbers by previous surveyors as far back as
1968. At the request of TARL, the sites in Seminole Canyon
were a s s i g n e d those n u m b e r s , so that site d e s i g n a t o r s are
more of a n o m i n a l d e v i c e . In so far as was p o s s i b l e , site
numbers were assigned g e o g r a p h i c a l l y and those newly recorded
in the 41VV364-377 series are on Presa Canyon or on the east
b a n k of S e m i n o l e Canyon. Sites numbered from 41VV393-398
are at the northern end of the Park between the header tributaries to Seminole Canyon and those in the 400 series are
west of S e m i n o l e or in the s m a l l p l o t east of the c o n f l u e n c e
of S e m i n o l e and the Rio Grande.
Of the sites p r e v i o u s l y recorded, those numbered between
41VV72-145 were located in the first area! survey conducted
by Graham and D a v i s in 1958. Those in the 200 series res u l t e d from Texas A r c h e o l o g i c a l S a l v a g e Project and Texas
Historical Commission surveys prior to the construction of
Amistad Reservoir (Parsons n.d., 1962). Sites in the 500
series were recorded by TPWD after the e s t a b l i s h m e n t of the
Park or by the Texas H i g h w a y Department a r c h e o l o g i s t s in
a n t i c i p a t i o n of the w i d e n i n g of U.S. 90.
Site D e f i n i t i o n
Sites were d e f i n e d on the b a s i s of the presence of
features or of t e m p o r a l l y or f u n c t i o n a l l y d i a g n o s t i c artifacts
a c c o m p a n i e d by other c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l , s u f f i c i e n t to i n d i c a t e
a more than passing use of the l o c a t i o n . In considering
s i t e d e f i n i t i o n in t h i s r e g i o n , it s h o u l d b e kept i n m i n d
that at v i r t u a l l y every c o n f l u e n c e and on every f l a t in the
Park, some evidence of prehistoric activity can be found.
U n l i k e other areas of the state, where a l i m i t e d flake or
b u r n e d rock scatter c o n s t i t u t e s a s i t e , in S e m i n o l e Canyon
some more s t r i c t c r i t e r i a m u s t be a p p l i e d to d i f f e r e n t i a t e
group a c t i v i t y from fleeting passage. Other than q u a r r i e s ,
only three p r e h i s t o r i c sites were d e f i n e d w h i c h l a c k features.
These l i t h i c or c e r a m i c / 1 i t h i c scatters were c o n s i d e r e d as
sites b e c a u s e the n u m b e r of tools or d i a g n o s t i c artifacts
allowed some functional or chronological interpretation.
I s o l a t e d a r t i f a c t s , l i g h t f l a k e or b u r n e d rock s c a t t e r s , and
some rock features were m a r k e d on the TPWD maps and t h e i r
presence noted in the f i e l d l o g . The e x c e l l e n t q u a l i t y of
the maps used a l l o w s for very precise plotting and relocation
of these areas in the future.
A second factor in site d e f i n i t i o n was the s e g r e g a t i o n
of the numerous sites found in r e l a t i v e l y close proximity

such as on the i n t e r f l u v e between the headers to S e m i n o l e
Canyon. The d e c i s i o n to d e f i n e site b o u n d a r i e s as s p e c i f i c a l l y as p o s s i b l e from s u r f i c i a l i n d i c a t i o n s was made in
c o n j u n c t i o n w i t h TPWD in order to f a c i l i t a t e c u l t u r a l resource
management and Park d e v e l o p m e n t .

Site Typology
For convenience in description and analysis, a site
typology was d e r i v e d w h i c h Was based on features w h i c h convey
functional or c h r o n o l o g i c a l information. The major rock
art sites treated in the first section are a class unto
t h e m s e l v e s because of the o r i e n t a t i o n of t h i s project, but
the differences between them and the f o l l o w i n g minor rock
art sites are q u a n t i t a t i v e rather than q u a l i t a t i v e in many
respects. These m i n o r rock art sites are rather a r b i t r a r i l y
d e f i n e d and range from c o m p l e t e p a n e l s to i s o l a t e d blotches
of paint. The d i v i s i o n between this class and rock shelters
w i t h o u t rock art may be only d e s c r i p t i v e of the extent of
the deterioration or destruction of the art.
Surface sites are classed as h i s t o r i c s i t e s , q u a r r i e s ,
burned rock sites, stone a l i g n m e n t s , and artifact scatters.
The l a s t three are not m u t u a l l y e x c l u s i v e so sites c o n t a i n i n g
examples of more than one feature are i n c l u d e d under the
g e n e r i c w h i c h best accomodates t h e i r primary m o r p h o l o g i c a l
characteristics.
T h i s t y p o l o g y , as is the case w i t h most c l a s s i f i c a t o r y
systems, is an i n t e r p r e t i v e aid intended to p r o v i d e a frame
of reference. W i t h i n each class, v a r i a t i o n s i m p l y differences
in f u n c t i o n , c h r o n o l o g y , or present c o n d i t i o n . Attempts
to c l a r i f y the effects of these factors m u s t rely on a
l a r g e r s a m p l e of the v a r i o u s site types from o u t s i d e the Park.
Si te R e e v a l u a t i on
The r e e v a l u a t i o n and relocation of a l l previously recorded sites t u r n e d out to be one of the most t i m e - c o n s u m i n g
aspects of the survey, e s p e c i a l l y in Presa Canyon. Here,
e i t h e r d u r i n g the o r i g i n a l recording or in later transfer of
site locations from the rather gross 15' USGS quadrangle
m a p s , an e n t i r e b l o c k of sites had been m i s p l a c e d one bend
downstream. To c o m p o u n d the error, some site d e s c r i p t i o n s
were a p p l i c a b l e to l o c a t i o n s where other sites were plotted.
Several days were spent s e a r c h i n g a b o v e B l a c k Cave for reported b u r n e d rock m i d d e n s before, in an i n s i g h t f u l flash,
Lee Bement r e a l i z e d that by m o v i n g the site l o c a t i o n s upstream one b e n d in the canyon, the sequence was corrected

( F i g . 1). Sites relocated by t h i s tactic are 41VV214, 217,
220 and 221. In a d d i t i o n , the t r i n o m i a l s on some sites in
Presa Canyon had been n u m e r i c a l l y interchanged and were thus
both incorrectly plotted and described in later reports. The
site numbers and l o c a t i o n s h a v e been c l a r i f i e d for 41VV145,

w h i c h only l o c a t i o n a l data was a v a i l a b l e , have been fully
recorded and updated site forms have been filed on all prev i o u s l y recorded sites in the Park. An e q u i v a l e n c y table,
r e l a t i n g the v a r i o u s d e s i g n a t o r s of sites to their correct
t r i n o m i a l s , is i n c l u d e d (Table 4), but future investigators
should be particularly alert to possible past confusion in
reference to 41VV145, 214, 217, 220 and 221.

RESULTS OF THE S U R V E Y

Seventy a r c h e o l o g i c a l sites (Fig. 1, T a b l e 5) are now
l i s t e d in S e m i n o l e Canyon State H i s t o r i c Park and are thus
Texas state a r c h e o l o g i c a l l a n d m a r k s . The majority a l s o fall
w i t h i n t h e S e m i n o l e Canyon N a t i o n a l R e g i s t e r D i s t r i c t . Prior
to this survey, thirty-one sites had been reported w i t h i n the
Park - fourteen rock art sites, e i g h t rock s h e l t e r s , one quarry,
five burned rock m i d d e n s , one artifact scatter, and two historic
sites. One rock s h e l t e r , 41VV587, was s u b s e q u e n t l y destroyed
by highway construction and one historic site, 41VV588, a
r a i l r o a d - e r a b a k i n g oven, was moved into the Park (Patterson
1980). S i t e 41VV446, I n f i e r n o Camp, was c o n s i d e r e d as on
Park l a n d s in the TPWD inventory of 1979 but only a s m a l l
portion w i t h few d e f i n e d features is a c t u a l l y w i t h i n the
b o u n d a r i es .
T h i r t y - e i g h t sites were added to the Park i n v e n t o r y
by this survey - two rock art sites, two shelters w i t h remn a n t rock art, n i n e burned rock s i t e s , four q u a r r i e s , t w e l v e
sites with stone a l i g n m e n t s , three open l i t h i c or ceramic
scatters, and six h i s t o r i c sites (Table 5). From these l i s t s ,
it is apparent that the emphasis of earlier surveys on rock
art and o c c u p i e d shelters concentrated on the canyons to the
e x c l u s i o n of the more m u n d a n e sites of the slopes and u p l a n d s .
In a d d i t i o n , it was to our a d v a n t a g e that the new site types
(Fig. 8) d e s c r i b e d as c i r c u l a r stone a l i g n m e n t s and o b l o n g
c a i r n s had been first i n d e n t i f i e d in t h i s region by the
P r i n c i p a l I n v e s t i g a t o r in 1974.
The s u r v e y crew was therefore
a l e r t to the m o r p h o l o g y of the features, the l i k e l y t o p o g r a p h i c
s e t t i n g , a n d t h e artifact a s s e m b l a g e s w h i c h c h a r a c t e r i z e these
sites.
D e s p i t e the i n t e n s i t y of t h i s survey, it is s t i l l q u i t e
probable that a d d i t i o n a l sites, e s p e c i a l l y of the new site
types, w i l l be found w i t h i n the Park. The subtlety of s m a l l
features, constructed of n a t i v e m a t e r i a l s w h i c h b l e n d into the
b a c k g r o u n d , was s t r i k i n g l y demonstrated by the d i f f i c u l t y we
often had in r e l o c a t i n g sites even when we knew where they
were. For e x a m p l e , 41VV369, an i s o l a t e d stone r i n g a b o v e
V a q u e r o S h e l t e r , was first seen on a t r i p u n c o n n e c t e d w i t h the
survey d u r i n g the h e i g h t of the d r o u g h t of 1980.
Subsequent
r e c o r d i n g took p l a c e after the r a i n s had promoted the growth
of v e g e t a t i o n w h i c h effectively obscured the feature. If its
l o c a t i o n had not been known, it is d o u b t f u l that the c i r c u l a r i t y
of this a l i g n m e n t would have been r e c o g n i z a b l e through the brush
A second factor in s i t e v i s i b i l i t y is the c o n t i n u i n g exposure
of a d d i t i o n a l features in the h e a r t h f i e l d s on the c a l i c h e flats
This process was a m p l y demonstrated by our r e - e v a l u a t i o n of the
area of s i t e 41VV542 and in the l a t e emergence of s i t e 41VV418
after e x t r e m e l y heavy r a i n s in 1982.

further e x a m i n e d to d e t e r m i n e if it merits site d e s i g n a t i o n .
A s i n k h o l e on the east bank of S e m i n o l e Canyon across from
Fate B e l l Shelter, is a restricted surface o p e n i n g w h i c h ,
after an i n i t i a l drop of about 5 m., opens into a floored
c a v e r n 30 x 65 m. in area. B o u l d e r s r o l l e d into the o p e n i n g
to protect l i v e s t o c k had to be removed prior to entry; the
o p e n i n g is restricted to a shaft just l a r g e e n o u g h for a
full-grown person. Bones on the talus cone beneath the
o p e n i n g proved to be r a b b i t and sheep. However, s i m i l a r
s i n k h o l e s h a v e y i e l d e d h u m a n bone and may h a v e served as
b u r i a l v a u l t s (41VV342, TARL files). This cavern s h o u l d be
further i n v e s t i g a t e d by m a p p i n g and testing of the subsurface
material in the talus cone. It could be expected that ongoing deposition of washed-in sediments would obscure intentional disposal of the dead in this convenient s i n k h o l e .

The narrative descriptions of the seventy sites w i t h in the Park are ordered according to site type as defined by
their primary features. For cross-reference, a d d i t i o n a l
c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s are t a b u l a t e d in n u m e r i c a l order (Table 5).

M A J O R ROCK ART SITES (.7)

Several criteria were used to judge the s i g n i f i c a n c e of
rock art sites. 41VV72, the Red Monochrome site; 41VV201, the
Red L i n e a r s i t e ; a n d 41VV77, t h e h i s t o r i c a b o r i g i n a l p i c t o g r a p h ,
are all r e p r e s e n t a t i v e of a d i s t i n c t and r e l a t i v e l y u n c o m m o n
style of rock art. 41VV73, 74, 76, and 83 hold a p r o f u s i o n of
Pecos R i v e r and other styles in a fairly good state of preserv a t i o n . In a d d i t i o n , prior documentation, since the 1930's,
is a v a i l a b l e for a l l seven of these sites, p r o v i d i n g a b a s i s
for judgements on s i t e c o n d i t i o n s over the past 50 years. W i t h
the s o l e e x c e p t i o n of 41VV72 whose i m a g e r y is v i r t u a l l y o b l i t e r a t e d , these sites were documented by c o n v e n t i o n a l and stereophotography (Table 3) and are the major topics of the conservator's statements (Silver n.d.). 41VV75, often c o n s i d e r e d a
major rock art site, has been relegated to secondary status
b e c a u s e of its a d v a n c e d state of d e t e r i o r a t i o n , a c o n d i t i o n w e l l e s t a b l i s h e d before the 1930's ( K i r k l a n d n.d.; Pearce and J a c k s o n
1933) .

RESULTS OF THE

41VV72, S e m i n o l e W a t e r i n g H o l e
41VV72 is one of o n l y two l a r g e p a n e l s of Red Monochrome figures recorded on the Texas s i d e of the Rio Grande
( K i r k l a n d and N e w c o m b 1967: 81); one is known from the
M e x i c a n s i d e . In early s t u d i e s , 41VV72 was t h o r o u g h l y
documented ( K i r k l a n d 1937b: Plate 16; K i r k l a n d and Newcomb
1967: 82-85; Jackson 1938: Site 85).
Its o m i s s i o n from
later projects can perhaps be attributed to Graham and Davis'
n e g a t i v e e v a l u a t i o n of the p i c t o g r a p h s in 1958.
Serious
damage has been inflicted by v a n d a l s , flooding, and extensive
l i c h e n c o l o n i z a t i o n . The other nearby Red Monochrome site,
41VV78, is m u c h more v i v i d and has suffered less from the
r a v a g e s of man and nature.
Two of the most d a m a g i n g factors are a d i r e c t f u n c t i o n
of the l o c a t i o n of 41VV72 on the first bend of S e m i n o l e Canyon,
400 m. s o u t h of U.S. 90 and b e h i n d a permanent water source
known l o c a l l y as S e m i n o l e W a t e r i n g H o l e . Low in the canyon
w a l l , the shelter is washed by runoff from very r a i n ; the toll
of m a s s i v e flooding is measured by the v i r t u a l d i s a p p e a r a n c e
of a l a r g e b u r n e d rock m i d d e n reported by K i r k l a n d (1937b:
113) and Jackson (1938: 221) as l y i n g on the bank in front of
the o v e r h a n g . The a p p e a r a n c e of t h i s m i d d e n must h a v e been
s t r i k i n g for K i r k l a n d to h a v e named 41VV72 as "the type
station for the b u r n t rock m o u n d c u l t u r e . " ( K i r k l a n d 1937b:
113). This m i d d e n was reported as washed and covered w i t h
g r a v e l i n 1958 (Graham and D a v i s n.d.) but s t i l l a p p a r e n t l y
r i c h , d e e p a n d q u i t e e x t e n s i v e . Some traces m a y l i e b e n e a t h
the a c c u m u l a t e d g r a v e l beds and the intensity of o c c u p a t i o n
is s t i l l i n d i c a t e d by the numerous mortar h o l e s , in excess
of 100, on the bedrock benches facing the shelter. The loss
of t h i s m i d d e n represents more than s i m p l y the washout of one
more canyon bottom site. W i t h it, and the s i m i l a r feature at
41VV78, went one p o s s i b i l i t y for a s s o c i a t i n g the Red Monochrome style w i t h h a b i t a t i o n a l d e b r i s , and by e x t e n s i o n , a
more s p e c i f i c t i m e p e r i o d .
S c o u r i n g of the w a l l s by the f l o o d - b o r n e sands and
g r a v e l s w h i c h now o b s c u r e the canyon floor can be c r e d i t e d
w i t h some of the f a d i n g of the red p i g m e n t s . It s h o u l d be
noted however that K i r k l a n d d e s c r i b e d three h u m a n figures
(Fig. 4), once red, w h o s e v e s t i g a l s h a p e , then as now, was
only d i s c e r n a b l e as a yellow s t a i n , attributed by him to the
p e n e t r a t i o n of the rock surface by the p i g m e n t b i n d e r . Three
p i g m e n t s a m p l e s from 41VV72 were submitted for p i g m e n t
a n a l y s i s ; a l l f a i l e d to r e g i s t e r a m i n e r a l pattern ( A p p e n d i x
II). The reasons for t h i s are as yet u n d e t e r m i n e d and
a d d i t i o n a l analyses are planned.
The r o u t i n g of h i s t o r i c roads and r a i l r o a d s , and the
a v a i l a b i l i t y o f t h a t most p r e c i o u s s u b s t a n c e , water, drew

a c h i e v e d some s e m b l a n c e of i m m o r t a l i t y , or infamy, by inscribing their names over the pictographs (Fig. 9a). One
series has been p a i n t e d w i t h a t h i c k , b l a c k l i q u i d p a i n t and
a second w i t h a c o r r o s i v e s u b s t a n c e w h i c h b l e a c h e d the gray
l i m e s t o n e surface.
A t h i r d a g e n t a d v e r s e l y affecting the p i c t o g r a p h s at
41VV72 is the once-dense growth of l i c h e n w h i c h encroached
upon the panel from a b o v e . The p e d o g e n i c a c t i o n of l i c h e n is
a function of both m e c h a n i c a l and c h e m i c a l processes (Ascaso
and G a l v a n 1975). Root growth a c t i v e l y creates m i n u t e
c a v i t i e s in the l i m e s t o n e and weak acids released by the
organism etch the rock surface and substrate. The absence of
l i c h e n on the lower segment of the s h e l t e r may be attributed
to h i g h water erasure as scars from previous growth can be
detected to the current l e v e l of the p o o l .
The now-dead o r g a n i s m s were r e s i d e n t i n the s h e l t e r when
the panel was p a i n t e d ; red p i g m e n t covers some traces of l i c h e n
The colony f l o u r i s h e d , e x p a n d i n g to obscure major portions
of the m u r a l , then died sometime prior to 1932.
Photographs
by Jackson (n.d.) e x a c t l y mirror the d i s t r i b u t i o n of l i c h e n
today. The reasons for the d e m i s e are p r o b a b l y e n v i r o n m e n t a l .
The l i c h e n has been i d e n t i f i e d as one of the crustose type,
a s l o w - g r o w i n g , h a b i t a t - s p e c i f i c s p e c i e s (Egan 1980). Its
spread over the figures indicates a c o n s i d e r a b l e span of
growth; the agents of d e s t r u c t i o n were p r o b a b l y dead by 1880
as no r a i l r o a d graffiti bear the scars of l i c h e n growth.
The Red M o n o c h r o m e style is g e n e r a l l y a t t r i b u t a b l e to
Late P r e h i s t o r i c p e o p l e s (A.D. 600 to contact) based on the
bow and arrow clearly illustrated at both 41VV72 (Fig. 4) and
41VV78. The l i c h e n growth at 41VV72, however, may p r o v i d e
the means for n a r r o w i n g t h i s broad s p a n to a more specific
i n t e r v a l . T h e s u p e r i m p o s i t i o n o f p i g m e n t upon l i c h e n , w i t h
the s u b s e q u e n t encroachment of the colony upon the f i g u r e s ,
indicates the p a i n t i n g s were drawn d u r i n g a time when these
h a b i t a t - s p e c i f i c s p e c i e s (Egan 1980) f l o u r i s h e d in a more
h u m i d e n v i r o n m e n t (Neck 1981) u n t i l a l t e r a t i o n s , such as
d e s s i c a t i o n , h a l t e d t h e i r growth prior to 1880.
G i v e n their
extremely slow growth rate, it may be a s s u m e d that these
favorable conditions lasted for a considerable l e n g t h of time,
m e a s u r a b l e in decades rather than years. That t h i s mesic
state was not l o c a l i z e d to 41VV72 may be demonstrated by the
d e m i s e of c o l o n i e s in a s i m i l a r s i t u a t i o n at 41VV222 in Presa
Canyon, a l t h o u g h no exact c o r r e l a t i o n between these two sites
is possible. Taking into consideration the suggested o r i g i n
of the Red M o n o c h r o m e style in northern, i n t r u s i v e groups,
it seems p o s s i b l e that a m e s i c i n t e r l u d e , s i m i l a r to the
one detected at Bonfire S h e l t e r in deposits d a t a b l e to 2500
years ago ( D i b b l e 1965; D i b b l e and L o r r a i n 1968; Bryant 1969;
Bryant and Shafer 1977) may coincide with the time span of
these p i c t o g r a p h s . One p o s s i b l e c l i m a t i c i n t e r v a l ca. A.D.

a yellow stain to i n d i c a t e their o r i g i n a l form.
K i r k l a n d b e l i e v e d this stain resulted from the

Lower Pecos ( D i l l e h a y 1974; C o l l i n s 1972; Lynott 1979) and
drastic c l i m a t i c c h a n g e on the more northern P l a i n s (Bryson
1980). C e r t a i n l y , a p r o b l e m for future consideration is an
attempt to detect this i n t e r v a l in e n v i r o n m e n t a l studies of
datable archeological deposits w i t h i n the region.
A second a l t e r n a t i v e for future consideration is the
d a t i n g of the l i c h e n b o d i e s t h e m s e l v e s . L i c h e n s a m p l e s from
41VV222 have been collected to determine the residual organic
content of the l i c h e n scars. The new r a d i o c a r b o n d a t i n g
techniques under development at several institutions (e.g.
P a v l i s h and B a n n i n g 1980) w h i c h r e q u i r e only fractions of the
s a m p l e size needed for c o n v e n t i o n a l assay, may be a p p l i c a b l e
to the p r o b l e m s of d a t i n g the Red Monochrome style at 41VV72.
The stereophotogrammetric r e c o r d i n g of 41VV72 o r i g i n a l l y
p l a n n e d was a b a n d o n e d w h e n , d e s p i t e the use of v a r i o u s filters
and infra-red f i l m s , no satisfactory i m a g e s were c a p t u r e d .
D u r i n g later comparisons of the p h o t o g r a p h s of the 1930's
w i t h the c o n d i t i o n of the rock art today the contrast in the
clarity of the figures seemed o v e r w h e l m i n g proof of extreme
f a d i n g . It was o n l y d u r i n g a s i m i l a r a n a l y s i s of 41VV77 that
the different s e n s i t i v i t y of films to the spectrum emerged as
a c o n t r i b u t i n g factor. In the 1930's, f i l m r e s p o n s i v e to the
lower end of the spectrum had not become commonly a v a i l a b l e ,
so reds a p p e a r e d b l a c k , thus e m p h a s i z i n g the p r e d o m i n a n t l y

It has p r e v i o u s l y been noted that to judge the current
appearance of the pictographs a g a i n s t K i r k l a n d ' s i l l u s t r a t i o n s
is a case of the real v e r s u s the i d e a l (Fig. 4). His i n t e n t
was to show the art through the eyes of the artist, to show
them as they were. His educated use of a r t i s t i c l i c e n s e was
soundly based in a thorough knowledge of the tradition, conv e n t i o n s , and repertoire of forms. Here, however, the encyclop e d i a of style was l i m i t e d to one other s i t e , 41VV78, There

assume that only the most c l e a r were s e l e c t e d , and that K i r k l a n d ' s panel is reconstruction and the t r i u m p h of the human

In summary, three agents of destruction are v i s i b l y

Fate B e l l Annex s e e m i n g l y has l i t t l e coherence in
artistic t h e m a t i c s , p o s s i b l y a result of time d i f f e r e n t i a l
in p a i n t i n g s . As is e v i d e n t at a l l sites proximal to the
r a i l r o a d - e r a c o n s t r u c t i o n camps, h i s t o r i c graffiti d a t a b l e to
the 1880's has been inscribed on the shelter walls. Fortunately, w a s h o u t of the canyon so lowered the floors that
most of the rock art was spared by its i n a c c e s s i b i l i t y .
As the first site s c h e d u l e d for photogrammetry, Fate
B e l l Annex was a l e a r n i n g e x p e r i e n c e for a l l of us. Twentysix stereopairs were taken from 26 stations and one overall
pair was shot from across the canyon. Plots of the c o n f i g u ration of the shelter (Fig. 10) and of most of the rock art
are on f i l e at TMM.
41VV74, Fate B e l l Shelter
One of the l a r g e s t and best known s h e l t e r s in the Southwest, Fate B e l l is famous not only for its pictographs and
the d e p t h and extent of the p r e h i s t o r i c c u l t u r a l d e p o s i t s ,
but for the m a g n i t u d e of the d i s r u p t i o n of those d e p o s i t s by
decades of r e l i c h u n t i n g . L o o k i n g now l i k e a m i c r o c o s m of
the l a n d s c a p e of the moon, f u l l of craters and m o u n d s of backd i r t , the shelter was chosen by Jackson for excavation in 1932
because it was the l e a s t d i s t u r b e d in S e m i n o l e Canyon (Pearce
and Jackson 1933). In the one month allocated for excavation,
a T-trench was dug from the t a l u s to the w a l l , and a l o n g the
back w a l l . A second trench was p l a c e d a l o n g the w a l l in the
upstream end. V e r t i c a l p r o v e n i e n c e control was m a i n t a i n e d to
some degree, recorded i n i n c h e s below the surface.
A l t h o u g h the majority of the p u b l i s h e d information
(Thomas 1933; Pearce and Jackson 1933) is devoted to a d e s c r i p tion of material c u l t u r e , features recorded i n c l u d e d seven
sotol p i t s , e i g h t b u r i a l s (one w h i c h c o n t a i n e d t h e r e m a i n s
of four i n d i v i d u a l s and two w i t h no s k e l e t a l m a t e r i a l ) , b u r i e d
bedrock mortars, and a l a r g e a b r a d i n g stone w i t h n u m e r o u s
grooves s i m i l a r to the b o u l d e r now part of the TPWD g u i d e d
tour e x h i b i t s . Items r e l a t a b l e to the rock art were bars of
pressed y e l l o w ocher, a c h a r c o a l p e n c i l , s h e l l or stone
palettes, and red-stained metates and manos. During our docum e n t a t i o n of the site, one l i m e s t o n e p e s t l e w i t h red p i g m e n t
on the s t r i k i n g end was c o l l e c t e d from the surface.
D e s p i t e the p r e s u m e d intact n a t u r e of the d e p o s i t s , Jackson comments that s p e c i m e n s of all types of projectile p o i n t s ,
both dart and arrow p o i n t s , were found at all l e v e l s , contrary
to h i s e x p e r i e n c e in the burned rock m i d d e n s of C e n t r a l Texas.
No r a t i o n a l e for this uniform d i s t r i b u t i o n was preferred, but
as s t r a t i g r a p h i c s e p a r a t i o n of arrow and dart p o i n t s is well

demonstrated in undistubed sites in the region, the most
reasonable e x p l a n a t i o n is prior m i x i n g of the deposits.
Testing of 41VV74 , as part of the salvage operations prior
to Amistad Reservoir impoundment, consisted of squaring the
w a l l s of two p o t h o l e s and e x c a v a t i n g one a d d i t i o n a l u n i t . In
the o p i n i o n of the excavators, the d e p o s i t s retained s u f f i c i e n t
i n t e g r i t y , e s p e c i a l l y with depth, to warrant e x t e n s i v e excav a t i o n (Parsons 1965). As a r e s u l t of these prior i n v e s t i gations the TPWD Master Plan (1973: 68) includes as part of
the interpretive program, a recommendation for a small archeological dig to be done during the h i g h use months.
In 1975, TPWD a r c h e o l o g i s t s m a p p e d the shelter i n t e r i o r
with compass and tape. A p l a n map and seven cross sections
were made a v a i l a b l e to us for our study. In 1981, near the
close of our second field season, acting upon an assessment
of rock art deterioration accelerated by the chemical reaction
of ashy dust so prevalent in the shelter (Land 1977), the
TPWD staff sprayed the deposits w i t h polyvinyl acetate, a
soil s t a b i l i z e r . The r e s u l t is a p l a s t i c i z e d , c o h e s i v e 5 cm.
layer r e m i n i s c e n t in texture of astroturf. This c o a t i n g is
renewed at r e g u l a r i n t e r v a l s due to p e n e t r a t i o n and break up.
The p i c t o g r a p h s of Fate B e l l Shelter are among the best
documented of the Pecos R i v e r style. Those on the projecting
w a l l s above the floor are well preserved (Fig. 11); the lower
murals are v i r t u a l l y destroyed.
Partially buried by accumul a t e d d e b r i s , the b a s a l segments are o b l i t e r a t e d ; the h i g h e r
p a n e l s are affected by s p a l l i n g and m i n e r a l d e p o s i t i o n .
The majority of the rock art in Fate B e l l is Pecos R i v e r
style; s u p e r i m p o s i t i o n s w i t h i n the style contributed to phase
designations derived by Gebhard (1965). At the far upstream
end of the shelter, h i g h above the current floor, a group of
Red Linear figures wends their way across the l e d g i n g of the
c e i l i n g into a c o m p o s i t i o n of b l a c k s e m i c i r c l e s and crossed
l i n e s ( F i g . 5b, c). As at 41VV201, the m i n i a t u r e figures
v i v i d l y convey a sense of a n i m a t i o n and v i t a l i t y . Other shared

in this case, apparently l a n c e s . Associated geometries, the
looped l i n e s , are i d e n t i c a l to those at 41VV201. The i l l u s trated figures are far a b o v e reach and were only d i s c e r n a b l e
through the t e l e p h o t o l e n s . T h i s v i g n e t t e seems to be a true
p i c t o g r a p h in the s t o r y - t e l l i n g sense. In G e b h a r d ' s a n a l y s i s
of this c o m p o s i t i o n of Red L i n e a r f i g u r e s , he reports two
bows and five batons or flutes, thus the basis for his correl a t i o n w i t h the Southwestern flute-player theme and the dating
of the style to the Late Prehistoric Period. Whether the
h a n d - h e l d instruments are in fact bows is not v e r i f i a b l e and
they may s i m p l y be the rods or staffs so c o m m o n l y portrayed
on the Red L i n e a r p a n e l s .

a g r e e d that these c e i l i n g p a n e l s and those on the far u p s t r e a m
end of the shelter must have been p a i n t e d from scaffolds or
l a d d e r s ( K i r k l a n d and N e w c o m b 1967: 50; G e b h a r d 1965: 49).
As Fate B e l l is the focus of the o r g a n i z a t i o n of the
Park, the deterioration of the rock art has been of p r i m e concern. A h y d r o t h e r m o g r a p h has been i n s t a l l e d to m o n i t o r v a r i a b i l i t y in h u m i d i t y and temperature. The coating of the
d e p o s i t s to control the e v e r - p r e s e n t dust was the first
measure taken to reduce that hazard. Modern graffiti, sprayp a i n t e d in i r i d e s c e n t g r e e n , has been covered by a c r y l i c
p a i n t w h i c h b l e n d s w i t h t h e n a t u r a l color o f t h e w a l l s ( R a l p h
1981, see pg. 193).
These measures are the first step towards
p r e s e r v a t i o n of the p i c t o g r a p h s .
S i x t y - s e v e n camera s t a t i o n s were e s t a b l i s h e d w i t h i n t h e
shelter; three were necessary for the o v e r a l l c o n f i g u r a t i o n
i l l u s t r a t e d in Figure 12. The dust was a nemesis, coating
every object, not to the e x c l u s i o n of the workers who were
forced to wear dust masks when in the rear of the site. Although cameras were cleaned every n i g h t , e v e n t u a l l y one

41VV76, B l a c k Cave
B l a c k C a v e , in m i d - P r e s a Canyon, is one of the most
p h y s i c a l l y i m p r e s s i v e shelters in the Park (Fig. 13a).
Because of its r e l a t i v e l y low p o s i t i o n in the r i g h t w a l l of
the c a n y o n , the site has been s e v e r e l y subject to d e p o s i t i o n a l
and erosional events in the p a s t . Presently, washouts of
the shelter deposits have left isolated huge boulders p i l e d
i n a p y r a m i d in the center of the s h e l t e r . V i v i d p i c t o g r a p h s
lie h i g h on the downstream w a l l (Fig. 13b) and faded p a n e l s
can be discerned on the upstream periphery. Small figures
a r e i n t e r s p e r s e d a m o n g t h e s p a l l l i n e s left b y a n c i e n t surfaces; others lie on the p r o j e c t i n g l e d g e s in the rear of the

two h i g h l y e l a b o r a t e scenes of shamans surrounded by i m p a l e d

style and theme w h i c h may i m p l y the same a u t h o r s h i p . The
first downstream p a n e l , afforded some s l i g h t protection by a
curve in the w a l l and by a stunted tree, is s i g n i f i c a n t l y
b r i g h t e r than its n e i g h b o r i n g counterpart.
These two p a n e l s also convey some t e c h n i c a l i n f o r m a t i o n .
Both seem "Master of the A n i m a l s " - shamans surrounded by
m i n i a t u r e deer in v a r i o u s stages of b e i n g speared. Composed
of small dots of color, these precursors to the " p o i n t i l i s t "
school of French I m p r e s s i o n i s t p a i n t e r s m u s t h a v e used a
l i q u i d based paint to achieve this special effect. Whether
as a s i g n a t u r e or a r i t u a l o b l i t e r a t i o n , the f i n a l a p p l i c a t i o n
is an arc of red crossing the m a i n figures as though splattered from a b r u s h . The faded p i c t o g r a p h s a l o n g the downstream overhang are further obscured by manganese d i o x i d e
s t a i n s e n c r o a c h i n g from d r i p l i n e s a l o n g the r i m . Traces of
paint can be seen under and through this b l a c k stain, i m p l y i n g
that other p i c t o g r a p h s are now b u r i e d by the o v e r c o a t i n g .
Test excavations were conducted in B l a c k Cave in search
of a h i s t o r i c a b o r i g i n a l component s u g g e s t e d by the l a n d owners c o l l e c t i o n of metal arrowpoints from the site (Parsons
1962). The results were e s s e n t i a l l y n e g a t i v e ; only a few
M i d d l e and Late A r c h a i c dart p o i n t s were recovered from the
one s h a l l o w test pit. It was c o n c l u d e d that the 1954 flood
had destroyed any recent c u l t u r a l d e p o s i t s .
In t h i s r e g a r d , it is of some i n t e r e s t to note that

E v i d e n c e from Bonfire S h e l t e r i n d i c a t e s that
the d o m i n a n t processes r e s p o n s i b l e for this f i l l s e q u e n c e
were waning by 10,000 B.P. ( D i b b l e and Lorrain 1968: 24-27).
Sometime prior to 6800 years a g o , major erosion reduced the
d e p o s i t s in B l a c k C a v e to the l e v e l of the a n g u l a r u n c o n f o r m i t y .
The a c c u m u l a t i o n of c u l t u r a l d e p o s i t s then b e g a n a r o u n d
6800 r a d i o c a r b o n years ago when f i l l w i t h i n the shelter was
some 2 m. higher than at present. This d e p o s i t i o n was prob a b l y c o n t i n u o u s w i t h g e n e r a l l y h i g h e r v a l l e y f i l l than i s
currently present. This f i l l sequence c o n t i n u e d for at least
1300 years u n t i l , sometime after 5500 B.P., another major
erosional event stripped the majority of the deposits,
l e a v i n g only these cemented remnants of the former floors.
W i t h i n the Park, such remnant s p a l l l i n e s are exposed at
Fate B e l l A n n e x , P a n t h e r C a v e , and in the lower stretches
of Presa Canyon ( A p p e n d i x I).
Some narrowing of the p o s s i b l e time of the last proposed cut sequence is p r o v i d e d by other features at t h i s
s i t e and at Fate B e l l A n n e x . The l a r g e elaborate p i c t o g r a p h s
at B l a c k C a v e were p r o b a b l y p a i n t e d from floors now t r a c e a b l e
only as s p a l l l i n e s (Fig. 13). However, here and at Fate Bell
Annex, a b o r i g i n a l rock art l i e s beneath the old floor remnants
i n d i c a t i n g a p r e h i s t o r i c w a s h o u t of the s h e l t e r d e p o s i t s . The
test p i t excavated in the B l a c k C a v e at the h i g h e s t p o i n t in
t h e site produced only M i d d l e a n d Late A r c h a i c t i m e d i a g n o s t i c s
(Parsons 1962) yet the radiocarbon dates i m p l y an e x t e n s i v e
Early Archaic occupation. That the flood of 1954 was not
solely r e p o n s i b l e for the f l u s h i n g of the shelter is corroborated
by K i r k l a n d ' s ( K i r k l a n d and N e w c o m b 1967: 95) p h o t o g r a p h of
the site. The s p a l l l i n e s beneath the major p i c t o g r a p h s are
clearly e v i d e n t and the floor l e v e l v i s i b l e in the photograph
is m u c h as it is today.
A l t h o u g h s e v e r a l events may h a v e c o n t r i b u t e d to the
removal of the s h e l t e r f i l l , it seems q u i t e p o s s i b l e that the
second proposed cutting episode occurred d u r i n g the M i d d l e
A r c h a i c Period, thus e x p l a i n i n g the recovery of only M i d d l e
and Late A r c h a i c dart p o i n t styles in the extremely l i m i t e d

the M i d d l e and Late A r c h a i c d e p o s i t s to the i s o l a t e d pockets
at the h i g h e s t e l e v a t i o n s and perhaps d i s p l a c e d the soughtafter historic component. The n e g a t i v e correlation between
v a l l e y f i l l a n d flood m a g n i t u d e i m p l i e s events o f l e s s e r
force c o u l d h a v e affected t h e d e p o s i t s d u r i n g t h e period
i n d i c a t e d by the radiocarbon dates. As the v a l l e y floor
was cut deeper, more d i s c h a r g e was necessary to reach the
h i g h e r e l e v a t i o n s in the s h e l t e r . The 1954 flood c e r t a i n l y
had t h i s c a p a c i t y but it can be a s s u m e d from the p l a c e m e n t of

RESULTS OF THE SURVEV

Some i n t e n s i f i c a t i o n was o b t a i n e d but l i t t l e was g a i n e d in the
way of contrast between the red p i c t o g r a p h s and the dark grey
w a l l s . The use of a newly d e v e l o p e d 35 mm. copy f i l m , Kodak
technical p a n , at Vaquero Shelter (Fig. 15b) and the Red Linear
Site ( F i g . 18) proved more s u c c e s s f u l , in part because the
b a c k g r o u n d l i m e s t o n e is l i g h t e r than at 41VV72 and Fate B e l l
Annex. Continued e x p e r i m e n t a t i o n with s p e c i a l films s h o u l d
succeed in a l l o w i n g a clearer d e f i n i t i o n of the form of some of
the more faded pictographs but it s h o u l d be kept in m i n d that
t h e i r c l a r i t y is e x a g g e r a t e d .
Jackson (1938: 224) considered the b u r n e d rock m i d d e n s
of 41VV214 as a p o s s i b l e o c c u p a t i o n s i t e for the a b o r i g i n e s
r e s p o n s i b l e for 41VV77. The only typed artifact found at
41VV214 was a triangular biface, possibly an Aba-4o£o dart
p o i n t of l i t t l e v a l u e in temporal a s s i g n m e n t s , but the morphology of the c i r c u l a r m i d d e n s is c o n s i d e r e d a l a t e characteristic. P e r h a p s more p e r t i n e n t is the newly recorded stone

41VV83, Panther Cave
Once r e a c h e d only by a r d u o u s t r e k k i n g down the b o u l d e r strewn lower reaches of S e m i n o l e Canyon, Panther Cave is now
the most often v i s i t e d site in the Park. A c c e s s i b i l i t y from
Lake A m i s t a d prompted the Texas H i s t o r i c a l C o m m i s s i o n to
erect a tall c h a i n - l i n k fence across the m o u t h of the shelter
t o d i s c o u r a g e v a n d a l i s m ; t h e N a t i o n a l Park S e r v i c e m a i n t a i n s
a dock for the c o n v e n i e n c e of boaters to the s i t e . Once
h i g h in the canyon w a l l , the formerly e x t e n s i v e t a l u s cone
is now covered by the waters of the r e s e r v o i r w h i c h l a p only
a few meters below the shelter floor. L i t t l e remains of
c u l t u r a l e v i d e n c e except mortar h o l e s , an o c c a s i o n a l chert
a r t i f a c t , and the p i c t o g r a p h s .
Panther Cave must h a v e tested a l l of K i r k l a n d ' s powers
of o b s e r v a t i o n . A p r o f u s i o n of o v e r p a i n t i n g confuses the
eye just as the mass of color d e l i g h t s it. Towering figures
extend across the w a l l and onto the c e i l i n g , central themes
are large red striped figures with curious h i p - l e v e l tassels
or h o r n - l i k e projections on the head ( F i g . 16) and the preo c c u p a t i o n w i t h l e a p i n g cats for w h i c h the s i t e is named.
P a n e l s are found in three general l o c a t i o n s d e s i g n a t e d

expected, the panels on the exterior w a l l s are faded and
barely discernable. The p a i n t i n g s in the lateral alcove downstream are better preserved than those on the upstream e n d ,
p e r h a p s b e c a u s e of protective v e g e t a t i o n . The c o r r e l a t i o n
between exposure and degradation is verified w i t h i n the m a i n
body of the shelter by progressive deterioration a l o n g a
c l i n e from interior to exterior. Figures on the we!1-protected

l i t t l e c h a n g e in the past fifty years (Figs. 3, 16, 17).
In addition to the toll taken by natural exposure to
the elements, agents actively affecting the condition of the
pictographs are mineral s t a i n i n g a l o n g seep l i n e s , burrowing
insects, l i m i t e d p l a n t growth, and s p a l l i n g of both sealer
and p l a t u l a r types. A l a r g e area of the upstream i n t e r i o r
wall is obliterated by a white stain, presumably calcium
carbonates deposited by a seep spring. Pigment is stll v i s i b l e
t h r o u g h the t h i n n e r portions of t h i s d e p o s i t and it may be
presumed that p i c t o g r a p h s l i e b e n e a t h . T h e m i n e r a l c o m p o s i t i o n
of this stain s h o u l d be determined, and removal considered.
S i m i l a r s t a i n i n g , but of different colorations, affects several
sites in the Park; a suitable test site for removal techniques
is 41VV377 in Presa C a n v o n .
The extant i n s e c t holes c o i n c i d e with those v i s i b l e on
the photographs of the 1930's i n d i c a t i n g l i t t l e expansion of
the colony. S i m i l a r l y , plants w h i c h have e s t a b l i s h e d tenuous
root h o l d s in c r e v i c e s along the w a l l s have few a l t e r n a t i v e s
for growth and can be removed w i t h r e l a t i v e ease.
The most profound v a n d a l i s m of any of the figures probably
took place sometime in prehistory, because of its antiquity
it is now considered ritual o b l i t e r a t i o n . The largest of the
l e a p i n g panthers has been defaced by s c r a t c h i n g to the height,
of a normal person's reach. A s m a l l e r b l a c k s h a m a n figure
has been drawn to o v e r l a p the panther (Fig. 17).
Because of the extensive o v e r p a i n t i n g , Panther Cave was
l a r g e l y u t i l i z e d by Gebhard (1965) to define types and phases
by super i m p o s i t i o n s . Panther Cave was also the source of
p i g m e n t s a m p l e s used to study the s t r a t i g r a p h y of o v e r p a i n t i n g
(See A p p e n d i x II). Flecks of red p a i n t of s i m i l a r shade from
o b v i o u s l y superimposed figures were submitted. Taken from
two separate yet adjacent areas, and from two l e v e l s of p a i n t i n g ,
the four s a m p l e s p r o d u c e d two sets of i d e n t i c a l patterns
e q u a t a b l e to the l e v e l . That the p i g m e n t s from each l e v e l were
identical sets, d i s t i n g u i s h e d by l e v e l , suggests the underp a i n t i n g s were drawn as a unit, then at a later date were
p a i n t e d over by a second m u r a l . T h i s a p p r o a c h to the a n a l y s i s
of s u p e r i m p o s i t i o n was an e x p e r i m e n t i n i t i a t e d l a t e in the
field season and c e r t a i n l y merits further t e s t i n g . A suggested
corollary is the comparison of s t y l i s t i c a l l y s i m i l a r designs
from different sites to d e t e r m i n e if the p i g m e n t c o m p o s i t i o n
covaries.

A remnant course of p l a t u l a r s p a l l s a l o n g the l e d g e

late in J a n u a r y . Cracks in the exterior layers foretell the

The type of s p a l l i n g prevalent at Red Linear is descript i v e l y termed as s e a l e r , the detachment of t h i n p l a t e s from
the " s k i n " of the bedrock. The size of the recently d e t a c h e d
spall is larger than average at Red Linear probably because
of its l o c a t i o n a l o n g the c u r v a t u r e of the w a l l .
The causes of this p e e l i n g of the l i m e s t o n e are specul a t i v e at this time but s i m i l a r processes are active at a

laboratory for experiments in retarding scalar s p a l l i n g because
of the a l m o s t c o m p l e t e d e t e r i o r a t i o n of the p i c t o g r a p h s .

The spall indicated in this view was recovered from the base of the overhang on January 31,
1982, within a few days of its detachment. Probable cause is high humidity followed by a
hard freeze. The blank areas in the upper corners are due to the need to shade the pictograph from intense sunlight. The photograph was taken using high contrast Kodak Technical

The site was c l a s s i f i e d by Graham and D a v i s (1958: 24)
as one of t h e i r s m a l l s h e l t e r s . The o v e r h a n g is 25 m. l o n g

was too s m a l l for m e a n i n g f u l a n a l y s i s .
The w a l l s of the shelter are soft and c r u m b l i n g to
c h a l k y dust. The fate of the p i c t o g r a p h s is c l e a r l y i l l u s trated by the d e t e r i o r a t i o n of the site number VV84 w h i c h

ago ( F i g . 9b). The p r e s e r v a t i o n of the b l o t c h e s on the exterior curve of the end wall can be attributed to the denser
nature of the n a t i v e rock or to the m i n e r a l c o a t i n g w h i c h
has protected the w a l l from erosion.

this became generally accepted by field workers in the area.
The l o c a t i o n , as p l o t t e d in the f i l e s at TARL was that of
K i r k l a n d ' s site and u n t i l c o m p a r i s o n of the d e s c r i p t i o n by
Graham and D a v i s with our r e e v a l u a t i o n of the s i t e , the
a s s u m p t i o n was m a d e that 41VV145 was i n d e e d "Angel Shelter"
w h i c h is in fact across the canyon and 100 m. downstream.
T h i s is in part due to the v i s i b i l i t y of the l a t t e r w h i l e
the real 41VV145 is h i d d e n from v i e w by dense v e g e t a t i o n .
In a d d i t i o n , G r a h a m and D a v i s do not refer to 41VV145 in the
p u b l i s h e d report of their survey, and a l t h o u g h the site form
c l e a r l y states that the shelter is in the r i g h t w a l l of the
canyon, no mention is made of the pictographs, perhaps because of their extremely poor c o n d i t i o n .
To resolve this a m b i g u i t y , site records and map plottings
were amended to show 41VV145 as Graham and D a v i s o r i g i n a l l y
reported it, and a new site number (41VV377) was a s s i g n e d to
the well known, but never formally recorded, A n g e l S h e l t e r .
41VV145 is a s h a l l o w o v e r h a n g , 40 m. l o n g and 4 m. deep,
just a b o v e the canyon floor on the north (right) bank of
Presa Canyon, 450 m. downstream from B l a c k C a v e and 100 m.
upstream of 41VV377. A l a r g e soil bank is r e t a i n e d in front
of the o v e r h a n g and supports a dense growth of v e g e t a t i o n
w h i c h m i g h t obscure the remains of the extensive burned rock
m i d d e n d e s c r i b e d in the o r i g i n a l site report. The floor of
the shelter has been affected by major f l o o d i n g of Presa Canyon
w h i c h has r e m o v e d or d i s p l a c e d m u c h of the d e p o s i t ; a l i g h t
scatter of b u r n e d rock and f l i n t f l a k e s remains in the
western, downstream end. Only two tools - both l a r g e biface
fragments - were seen.
Rock art is s t i l l v i s i b l e a l o n g the e a s t e r n h a l f of the
rear w a l l but u n f o r t u n a t e l y most of it is o n l y red streaks
and b l o t c h e s of u n d e c i p h e r a b l e pattern. D i s c e r n a b l e patterns
are a red box s h a p e , an adjacent red s n a k e - l i k e l i n e composed
of short dashes m u c h l i k e those on the exterior panels of
B l a c k C a v e , a red h o l l o w - b o d i e d s h a m a n , a b l a c k s t i c k f i g u r e ,
and a red l i n e composed of a streamer with short p a r a l l e l
l i n e s e x t e n d i n g down in a f r i n g e - l i k e p a t t e r n i d e n t i c a l to
one on the upstream exterior w a l l at Panther Cave. A l t h o u g h
the majority of the r e m a i n i n g f i g u r e s are r e d , the p i c t o g r a p h s
are Pecos R i v e r Style.
The color 35 mm. s l i d e s t a k e n of the most c o m p l e t e

the s p a l l i n g and f a d i n g of the c o l o r s . It is p o s s i b l e t h a t ,
w i t h p a t i e n c e , an artist c o u l d produce a r e p l i c a of some of
the original designs. Alternatively, the experimental use
of h i g h - c o n t r a s t films m i g h t accentuate the reds sufficiently
to o b t a i n a s e m b l a n c e of t h e i r c o n f i g u r a t i o n . The s p a l l i n g

The u p p e r m o s t p a n e l now contains only one stylized h u m a n

T h i s site was o r i g i n a l l y a s s i g n e d the t r i n o m i a l number
41VV221 but was reported as 41VV217 (Parsons n.d., 1962).
Incorrect p l o t t i n g of both site locations, and that of comp a n i o n sites 41VV214 and 220, c o m p o u n d e d the c o n f u s i o n because the plotted l o c a t i o n of 41VV217 c o i n c i d e d w i t h the
a c t u a l l o c a t i o n of this minor rock art site. The error was
perpetuated 'in p r i n t by later analyses (Gebhard 1965: 114115) and the site's c o r r e l a t i o n with K i r k l a n d ' s Presa Canyon
Site 1 ( K i r k l a n d and Newcomb 1967: P l a t e 29) became accepted
(Anderson 1974: 24).
In a l l fairness to these a u t h o r s , our
survey party suffered from the same confusion because the
permanent f i l e s at TARL had been c h a n g e d on the site form
for 41VV217 but not on the ones for 41VV221. O n l y d u r i n g
our search for the m i s s i n g 41VV221 did the c o n t r a d i c t i o n become a p p a r e n t . To u n r a v e l t h i s G o r d i a n knot, the site

41VV377

41VV377 is a w e l l - k n o w n , but never formally registered,
rock s h e l t e r w i t h rock art, h i g h in the south (left) bank of
Presa Canyon 600 m. downstream from Black Cave and 800 m. upstream from Red L i n e a r . In the past, this site was erroneously
assumed to be 41VV145 as recorded by Graham and Davis (n.d.) in
1958 despite the fact that the o r i g i n a l site form clearly states
that 41VV145 is in the r i g h t bank of Presa Canyon. T h i s
mistake was perpetuated in print (Anderson 1974: 24;
Parsons 1962) and the correlation with K i r k l a n d ' s Pressa [sic]
Canyon Site 2 (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 68) was g e n e r a l l y
accepted. The location of 41VV145 was m i s p l o t t e d on TARL
permanent map f i l e s to c o i n c i d e with that of Pressa Site 2
and the name "Angel Shelter" given to the site based on the
f l y i n g creature drawn on the shelter w a l l a l t h o u g h t h i s design is more zoomorphic than cherubic (see K i r k l a n d and
Newcomb 1967 : Plate 29-3).
Site records h a v e been a m e n d e d to show 41VV145 as
o r i g i n a l l y reported on the opposite side of the canyon and
100 m. upstream; and the site i l l u s t r a t e d by K i r k l a n d has
been assigned the trinomial 41VV377. This rimrock shelter
is h i g h l y v i s i b l e from the upstream a p p r o a c h but is well
hidden from downstream by rock fall and v e g e t a t i o n . A large
pool is u s u a l l y retained in the canyon floor d i r e c t l y in
front and a l a r g e c r e v i c e between two r a p i d l y d e t e r i o r a t i n g
limestone blocks marks the center of the shelter. The l i m e stone is very soft and f o s s i l i f e r o u s , p o w d e r i n g to a fine
chalk w h i c h covers the entire interior. A trench has been
dug p a r a l l e l i n g the rear w a l l , p r o b a b l y in search of b u r i a l s .
The p i c t o g r a p h s are more e l a b o r a t e than shown in K i r k l a n d ' s
work. In a d d i t i o n to the b i r d , or butterfly, or a n g e l , or
trimotor p l a n e , for w h i c h the s h e l t e r was n a m e d , several
figures are i d e n t i f i a b l e - two black and red shamans, a red
a n d b l a c k c e n t i p e d e - l i k e o u t l i n e , a n d several very s m a l l
black figures h i g h on the upstream w a l l . The position of
the latter, well beyond reach from the present floor, is
r e m i n i s c e n t of s i m i l a r p a n e l s in other sites such as Fate
B e l l Shelter. Unfortunately, the black paint b l e n d s with the
darkened w a l l s and is very d i f f i c u l t to d i s c e r n in p h o t o g r a p h s .
Serious damage has been i n f l i c t e d by extensive l i c h e n
c o l o n i z a t i o n . The w a l l s are l i t e r a l l y covered w i t h the same
species that marred 41VV72. 41VV377 ranks as one of the most
r a p i d l y d e t e r i o r a t i n g rock art sites in the park because of
the p o w d e r i n g l i m e s t o n e and the l i c h e n . E x p e r i m e n t s in removal of the l i c h e n and re integration of the scars (see .

the first bend downstream from Vaquero Shelter and d i r e c t l y
across the canyon from 41VV214. 41VV370, another b u r n e d rock
site, l i e s directly upslope south of this small shelter.
Four continuous l o b e - l i k e alcoves under the rimrock show
some evidence of prehistoric occupation. The central alcove
is the l a r g e s t , 14 m. l o n g and 12 m. deep. The u p s t r e a m l o b e ,
10 m. l o n g and 4 m. d e e p , is separated from the central section
by a s m a l l a l c o v e , 5 m. l o n g and 2 m. deep. The fourth section
is formed by the downstream corner of the overhang and is 6 m.
long and 12 m. deep. The roof is s p a l l i n g and large flat sections of c o l l a p s e d roof cover the lower area w h i c h a l s o contains
burned rock, probably t a l u s from the m a i n o c c u p a t i o n area. C u l tural m a t e r i a l consists of four mortar holes in a b o u l d e r under
the central o v e r h a n g , a l i m i t e d scatter of burned rock, a few
flint flakes, one core, and fragmentary mussel s h e l l . No tools
or diagnostic artifacts were found. The shelter is o b v i o u s l y
favored by j a v e l i n a and the t h i n , ashy cultural deposit is
c o m p l e t e l y o v e r l a i n by m a n u r e .

T h i s site number had been a s s i g n e d and an approximate
l o c a t i o n indicated on a 15' USGS q u a d r a n g l e map but no description of the site was on f i l e at TARL. In December,
the site was relocated when a fragment of burned rock and
one f l i n t f l a k e were n o t i c e d just a b o v e the water l i n e on
the west bank of S e m i n o l e Canyon. The s h e l t e r is not d i r e c t l y
a c c e s s i b l e from the r e s e r v o i r but is e a s i l y entered from the

The s h e l t e r is 24.5 m. w i d e and 7 m. d e e p ; the roof
slopes from a m a x i m u m h e i g h t of 7 m. under the o v e r h a n g to
3 m. in the m a i n p o r t i o n . The t a l u s is on a very steep s l o p e

The soft, honeycombed w a l l s of the shelter are a c t i v e l y e r o d i n g , forming
benches and recent roof s p a l l s . The ashy, c h a l k y f i l l is
o v e r l a i n w i t h a t h i n layer of t h i s weathered l i m e s t o n e and
shows the effects of a n i m a l b u r r o w i n g . Fifteen mortar h o l e s
were counted in the be.nch at the southern end of the s h e l t e r
and thirteen in the bench at the northern end. B u r n e d rock,
a mano fragment, mussel s h e l l , numerous large chert flakes,
a primary flake scraper, a l a r g e knife of b l a c k chert, and
six biface fragments, i n c l u d i n g one Langtiy and one F^ol i k e dart p o i n t bases were recorded. S l i d e s of a b l a c k

to find this figure in the. s h e l t e r .
Two s m a l l alcoves just south of the shelter at a p p r o x i mately the same e l e v a t i o n were e x a m i n e d . A seep s p r i n g had
once formed a s m a l l pool in the uppermost, and may h a v e been
a source of water for the shelter's occupants. The slope to
the canyon floor is p r e c i p i t o u s , and access to canyon bottom

41VV545 i m m e d i a t e l y catches the eye of all v i s i t o r s to
the Park h e a d q u a r t e r s who often assume that t h i s large shelter
is the subject of the gui ded tours. Situated on the second
major bend on the east ba nk of S e m i n o l e Canyon some 400 m.
south of U.S. 90, t h i s hu ge shelter is h i g h l y v i s i b l e from
the o b s e r v a t i o n deck. Un fortunately, c a t a s t r o p h i c f l o o d i n g

bottom. R e m n a n t floors a re v i s i b l e at a h e i g h t of 2 m. above
the current surface.
The o n l y e v i d e n c e of human o c c u p a t i o n of the shelter is
mortar h o l e s ; the destruc t i v e force of the floods w h i c h
created h a v o c w i t h the de posits is i l l u s t r a t e d by three
mortar holes in a h u g e bo u l d e r in the center of the shelter

This s m a l l shelter was recorded in 1974, prior to the
w i d e n i n g of U.S. 90, by a r c h e o l o g i s t s of the Texas Department
of P u b l i c Safety and Transportation. The site was located
on the east (left) bank of Seminole Canyon just south of
U.S. 90; it has now been destroyed by construction of the
new h i g h w a y b r i d g e . The shelter was v i s i t e d by the survey
crew in A p r i l , 1930. The only c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l seen was
two chert flakes. This s m a l l cave was so low in the canyon
that the interior would have been frequently washed by h i g h
water .

some 500 m. above its juncture with Seminole Canyon (Fig. 1).
The northern park boundary passes across the nose of t h i s

across the canyon floor below the confluence of the two trib u t a r i e s . The site consists of in excess of 100 stone c i r c l e s
formed by six or e i g h t p a i r e d l i m e s t o n e b l o c k s (Fig. 8a),
probably pole supports for grass or hide-covered huts.

The suggested f u n c t i o n of these features as b u r i a l c a i r n s

Rock supports for a h i s t o r i c fence p a r a l l e l the tributary

is p r o b a b l e that construction m a t e r i a l s were gathered from
other rock features at the site, thus severely h i n d e r i n g any
spatial interpretation of the o r i g i n a l patterning.
Some reflection of remnant integrity may be seen in the

functioned in h i d e - p r e p a r a t i o n , from a l i m i t e d area at the
foot of the intact r i n g . The only t e m p o r a l l y d i a g n o s t i c a r t i fact found in proximity to any of the features was a broken
PeAd-tz arrow p o i n t found a m i d s t the four c a i r n s . Other
c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l noted on the rim is p r o b a b l y an a d m i x t u r e

Two s i m i l a r c a i r n s are located about 20 m. south, closer
to the r i v e r . . One is a l s o a l i g n e d n o r t h - s o u t h but the other
follows the contour l i n e and may be a n a t u r a l feature. The
size of the former is c o m p a t i b l e w i t h the two c a i r n s at the
h i g h e r e l e v a t i o n - 2.5 m. by 1 m.
The fifth and s i x t h rock p i l e s are remnants of a historic
fence l i n e w h i c h may a l s o have affected the c o n f i g u r a t i o n of
the other features at the site. One is s i m p l y four rocks
t i l t e d on end with a space in the center for a post; the
second is an u n d i f f e r e n t i a t e d p i l e on the same l i n e as the
first.
The two areas of the site are separated by a steep,
b e n c h i n g i n c l i n e . This h a s r e s u l t e d in c o n s i d e r a b l e w a s h i n g
of s e d i m e n t s across the lower benches and into the Rio Grande.
Atop the d i v i d e where erosion has been less severe, e n o u g h
s o i l r e m a i n s i n t a c t to o b s c u r e the lower courses of the c a i r n s .
The sandy clay s o i l s of the site thus vary in d e p t h from bedrock to 15 cm. and support b l a c k b r u s h , m o u n t a i n l a u r e l ,

Prior to the construction of Lake Am is tad, sheep w h i c h
grazed on the v e g a s of the Rio Grande were d r i v e n up H i d d e n
T r a i l , the only access l i v e s t o c k path to the u p l a n d s (Brotherton n.d.). This route comes up the deeper (western) of the
two m i n o r t r i b u t a r i e s w h i c h bound the site. At present, t h i s
t r a i l is s t i l l the easiest route to the reservoir and the one
used d u r i n g the survey. The site is thus d i s t u r b e d by modern
activity, i n c l u d i n g accessibility to collectors, which may
account for the lack of diagnostic artifacts observed. This
s i t e is i d e a l l y s i t u a t e d for e x p l o i t a t i o n of the flood p l a i n
of the R i o G r a n d e , the u p l a n d resources of the t r i b u t a r i e s ,
and the quarry sites recorded to the north. In a d d i t i o n to
the i d e n t i f i e d use of the area as an open camp site and a
historic t r a i l , some s p e c u l a t i o n on the c o - m i n g l i n g of A r c h a i c

has led to a r e t h i n k i n g of the s p a t i a l a n a l y s i s of the site.
A large rock shelter in the tributary wall just beneath
t h i s site and s l i g h t l y u p s t r e a m is d e v o i d of p r e h i s t o r i c
c u l t u r a l d e p o s i t s but the m o d e r n d e b r i s attests to its s u i t a b i l i t y as a c a m p i n g spot. The downstream s l o p e of the s h e l t e r

The r e s e m b l a n c e between these features and those reported as r e c t a n g u l a r c a i r n s renders their separate c l a s s i f i c a t i o n suspect. Their t o p o g r a p h i c l o c a t i o n , t h e i r size,

41VV401, The Rock W a l l
A rock w a l l (Fig. 21b) has been erected on the north rim
of the first s t e e p - w a l l e d tributary (.RH) to S e m i n o l e Canyon
on the r i g h t s i d e , south (downstream) of Fate B e l l S h e l t e r .
The w a l l p a r t i a l l y obstructs a trail from the canyon bottom
a p p r o x i m a t e l y 100 m. from the m o u t h of the tributary. From
this site, a direct view is afforded into a r o c k s h e l t e r , 41VV139, on the opposite wall of the tributary and a b o v e the
canyon floor.
E i g h t large s l a b s of n a t u r a l l y fractured l i m e s t o n e have
been propped up by s m a l l e r , blockier chunks to form a 5 m.

60 cm. h i g h , and 8 cm. in m a x i m u m t h i c k n e s s . The bedrock
just beneath the wall s t i l l shows the fracturing scars of the
s l a b s ; the t a b u l a r c a p p i n g rock was s i m p l y r a i s e d on end and
supported by a v a i l a b l e blocks of limestone. At one time the
wall was at least 6 m. l o n g , the eastern 1 m. has c o l l a p s e d
into r u b b l e .
The w a l l sits d i r e c t l y on bedrock. 2 to 4 cm. of s e d i ment has been trapped b e h i n d the l a r g e s l a b s , s u p p o r t i n g low
thorny weeds and mossy p l a n t s . Large b l a c k b r u s h e s grow at
both ends.
No c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l was found at the site and an
estimate of age may o n l y be d e r i v e d from the fracturing of
the w a l l . One large s l a b has split into three, and many of
the support b l o c k s are c r u m b l i n g . The d i s i n t e g r a t i o n of the
eastern one meter is a l m o s t complete. A d d i t i o n a l l y , fracture
scars are smoothed by wind erosion.
The w a l l p a r t i a l l y obstructs the only trail from the
bottom of the s i d e canyon near its c o n f l u e n c e w i t h S e m i n o l e .
Passage is s t i l l p o s s i b l e through a narrow gap at the western
end, i n d i c a t i n g this structure was not intended to c o n t a i n

were constructed u s i n g rock p i l e s as post supports. The w a l l

Q U A R R I E S (5)
F i v e q u a r r i e s are now recorded w i t h i n the b o u n d a r i e s of
the Park. O n e , 41VV219, was recorded by Parsons (1962) and
four, 41VV393, 405, 406 and 417, by t h i s survey. 41VV405 and
part of 41VV219 correspond to the o u t c r o p p i n g s of old g r a v e l s

from the bedrock a l o n g c e r t a i n contour l e v e l s of t r i b u t a r i e s
to S e m i n o l e Canyon. The Park contains an a b u n d a n c e of good
quality chert, and other l o c a l i t i e s where minor exposures
were noted are shown on maps furnished to TPWD. Site d e s i g nations were g i v e n to these five quarry l o c a t i o n s because of
the m a g n i t u d e of the resource.
41VV219
This quarry site was recorded by Parsons in 1962 as part
of the Texas A r c h e o l o g i c a l S a l v a g e Project survey prior to
the construction of Amistad N a t i o n a l R e s e r v o i r . The site is
located on the western b a n k of S e m i n o l e Canyon at its conf l u e n c e w i t h the Rio Grande and extends from the 1225 ft.
e l e v a t i o n to the top of the m e s a , a p p r o x i m a t e l y 50 ft. above.
The lower e l e v a t i o n s consist of t a b u l a r f l i n t n o d u l e s e r o d i n g

The h i g h e r e x p o s u r e s are coterminous w i t h the old g r a v e l s as
m a p p e d by S h a r p s and Freeman (1965) and consist of s u b a n g u l a r ,
rounded c o b b l e s . The more t a b u l a r n o d u l e s are p r i m a r i l y tan
and grey v a r i e t i e s of chert; the old g r a v e l s are p r e d o m i n a n t l y
white and p i n k .
E x c e l l e n t e x a m p l e s of the b e d d i n g of t a b u l a r chert w i t h i n

of u t i l i z a t i o n of t h i s quarry can be seen than at similar sites
across the canyon. This very p r o b a b l y is the r e s u l t of less

of t r i b u t a r i e s Rl and R2, e x t e n d i n g across the park boundary
to the first major tributary to the Rio Grande west of S e m i n o l e
Canyon. Chert c o b b l e s of v a r i o u s colors and shape, r a n g i n g

t e s t i n g , cores and core f r a g m e n t s , and a few l a r g e flakes. One
l a r g e , extremely p a t i n a t e d b i f a c e , one Panda-ie. dart p o i n t , and
one g u n f l i n t were the o n l y tools noted. The Panda£e p o i n t is
on the northern extremity of the site and has no a s s o c i a t e d

Artifact D e s c r i p t i o n s - 41VV405
One l a r g e core tool was c o l l e c t e d on the p r e l i m i n a r y
r e c o n n a i s s a n c e of 41VV405. This tool is l e a f - s h a p e d ,
p o i n t e d on one end and r o u n d e d on the o t h e r , and is
r h o m b i c in cross s e c t i o n . Lateral edges have been shaped
by the p e r c u s s i o n r e m o v a l of l a r g e f l a k e s . The b l a d e is
strongly b e v e l e d but t h i s is caused more by the n a t u r a l
s h a p e than by f l a k i n g . The m a t e r i a l is very coarse g r a i n e d
chert.
L e n g t h : 12.6 cm. W i d t h : 6.1 cm. T h i c k n e s s : 2.8 cm.
One u n u s u a l f l a k e was c o l l e c t e d from the d o w n s l o p e of
41VV405 near the head of the tributary to S e m i n o l e Canyon
w h i c h b o u n d s the s i t e on the south (Rl). D u r i n g the

41VV406
41VV406 is a quarry site comprised of tested cobbles and
flakes. Chert n o d u l e s are eroding from the bedrock a l o n g
the 1250 ft. contour bench of the first and second t r i b u t a r i e s
(Rl and R2) to S e m i n o l e Canyon north of the Rio Grande. The
raw material is found at this elevation along both tributaries
the h e a v i e s t use is seen a l o n g the north rim of Rl in an area
150 to 160 m. l o n g and 10 m. wide. Under one tree, in excess
of 60 flakes of s i m i l a r chert were counted. The chert
varieties here are grey and tan in contrast w i t h those at the
adjacent old gravel outcrop, 41VV405. Raw m a t e r i a l s from the
two sites are also differentiated by shape. The old g r a v e l s
are s u b - r o u n d e d and less a n g u l a r than the t a b u l a r n o d u l e s at
this site.
41VV417
This quarry consists of tested c o b b l e s , cores and f l a k e s
scattered from the 1225 ft. contour to the top of the flat
on the northern rim of the first tributary (R6) to S e m i n o l e
Canyon south of its juncture with Presa Canyon. The chert
c o b b l e s eroding from the l i m e s t o n e bedrock are a n a l o g o u s to
those found downstream at 41VV406. Among the e v i d e n c e for
heavy use of t h i s resource were numerous retouched flakes.
A R T I F A C T SCATTERS (4)

Three sites were recorded w h i c h are featureless but
w h i c h c o n t a i n e d n u m e r o u s artifacts of d e f i n a b l e type. In two
cases, 41VV365 and 373, the artifact scatter is on the northern
fence l i n e b o u n d i n g the Presa Canyon segment of the Park, and
the sites extend outside the jurisdiction of TPWD; a third,
41VV371, is on the southern side of Presa Canyon o p p o s i t e B l a c k

41VV365 c o n s i s t s of a l i g h t ceramic and l i t h i c scatter
found in the easement of the northern boundary above B l a c k
Cave (41VV76) in Presa Canyon and 150 m. north of 41VV364,
the b u r i a l c a i r n s . The site area is not w e l l - d e f i n e d and
may w e l l extend onto the a l k a l i flat to the north.
On the i n i t i a l discovery, seven sherds, three steeplyb e v e l e d end scrapers (Fig. 22m-o), one large biface, and a
few p r i s m a t i c b l a d e s were recorded. On s u b s e q u e n t v i s i t s an
a d d i t i o n a l six sherds, w h i c h had been exposed by recent r a i n f a l l , were c o l l e c t e d . The artifact a s s e m b l a g e is c o m p a r a b l e
to that of 41VV446, Infierno Camp, w h i c h l i e s on the next
i n t e r f l u v e to the west. The a c c e s s i b l e area around the recovered artifacts was i n t e n s i v e l y surveyed for features s u c h
as the stone c i r c l e s of I n f i e r n o Camp. None were found. The
c l o s e s t water source is the i n t e r m i t t e n t seep by B l a c k C a v e ,
a horizontal d i s t a n c e of a b o u t 125 m. and a c c e s s i b l e down the
s l o p i n g nose just east of the canyon. More permanent water
sources are 41VV222, some 350 m. up Presa Canyon, and the
s p r i n g in Infierno Canyon w h i c h b o u n d s this h i g h flat on the
west. It is thus p o s s i b l e that the artifacts are p e r i p h e r a l
to the m a i n body of the site w h i c h l i e s above and to the west.
S l o p e w a s h from t h i s h i g h e r area and some d i s t u r b a n c e from
cattle traffic are e v i d e n t . It is a l s o p o s s i b l e that the
a b s e n c e of v i s i b l e features is a t t r i b u t a b l e to b u r i a l or that
p o l e supports such as those so e v i d e n t at Infierno Camp were
not necessary in the deeper s o i l of t h i s flat. A t h i r d a l t e r n a t i v e i s , of course, that the site area is l i m i t e d to that
d e f i n e d by t h i s survey and that its importance is d e r i v e d from
the recovery of pottery, o n l y the third such surface site recorded in the Lower Pecos R i v e r r e g i o n . Because of the s i m i l a r i t y of the artifacts to those of Infierno and the rarity
of ceramics in the r e g i o n , the sherds and end scrapers were
c o l l e c t e d for c o m p a r i s o n to the I n f i e r n o s a m p l e .

Ceramics - thirteen sherds were recovered from 41VV365;
a l l appear to be from the same v e s s e l . The fragments
range in m a x i m u m thickness from 2 to 4 cm. The paste
is l i g h t tan with a darkened core. There are a p l a s t i c
i n c l u s i o n s of c a l c i t e , rounded quartz s a n d , and b l a c k
and grey r o u n d e d and a n g u l a r v o l c a n i c m a t e r i a l . The surface of most of the sherds are r o u g h e n e d , p r o b a b l y from
w e a t h e r i n g , as one s m a l l fragment has a s l i g h t l y redder
p o l i s h e d f i n i s h . The constituents of these c e r a m i c s are
similar to those recovered from 41VV424, a site located
at Bakers C r o s s i n g , some 35 km. north of U.S. 90. Perhaps of more importance are characteristics shared w i t h
pottery reported from sites in the A b i l e n e r e g i o n (Ray
1935; G r i f f i n 1935) where the artifact a s s e m b l a g e is
markedly l i k e that of Inflerno Camp and 41VV365.
41VV371
A scatter of l i t h i c d e b r i s and six tool fragments were
found d i s p e r s e d over a flat t r i a n g u l a r bench on the south s i d e
of Presa Canyon o v e r l o o k i n g Black Cave (41VV76) and 41VV222,
a p e r m a n e n t water source. The site is b o u n d e d on the west
by an old ranch fence; the gate normally used on the way down
to B l a c k C a v e is just a few meters south of t h i s l i t h i c
scatter. A jog in this fence l i n e marks the intersection of

other stacked rocks but no p a t t e r n i n g or r e l a t i o n s h i p to
the fence can be d i s c e r n e d . The a r t i f a c t s were found l y i n g
on bedrock or trapped in s m a l l s e d i m e n t pockets on the downs l o p e end of the flat bench. In a d d i t i o n to numerous flakes
and b l a d e s , three l a r g e biface fragments and three dart p o i n t
fragments were recorded. Two of the dart p o i n t s are v a r i e t i e s
of the En-601 type; the t h i r d is a t h i n , t r i a n g u l a r form of
undefi ned type.
This site corresponds in t o p o g r a p h y and artifact recovery
to the site of the b u r i a l c a i r n s , 41VV364, on the o p p o s i t e
side of the canyon. However, the site area has been d i s t u r b e d
by modern c o n s t r u c t i o n and the runoff from h i g h e r slopes has
displaced much of the l i t h i c material.

This l i t h i c scatter extends a l o n g both sides of the
northern fence l i n e on the rim of Presa Canyon d i r e c t l y a b o v e
rock art site 41VV212. The density of c h i p p i n g d e b r i s i n
t h i s area was first noted d u r i n g an a r c h e o l o g i c a l survey prior
to fence c o n s t r u c t i o n (Dibble 1978b). R e e x a m i n a t i o n of the

two dart p o i n t bases. A few fragments of burned rock were
a l s o scattered t h r o u g h o u t the area w i t h no n o t i c e a b l e concent r a t i o n s . Two p o s s i b l e stone features are p a r t i a l l y b u r i e d

are v i s i b l e from the right-of-way. Limestone blocks have
been used to shore up the gaps between the fence and the b e d rock .

T h i s site was reported to TPWD a r c h e o l o g i s t s by Park
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t , Ken B e n a d , in 1978.
Described as a burned
rock scatter with accompanying l i t h i c material, the site lies
a l o n g the e m b a n k m e n t of the a b a n d o n e d Southern P a c i f i c r a i l road just south of the R9 tributary to S e m i n o l e Canyon.
D u r i n g the r e e v a l u a t i o n of the site in 1980, burned rock,
l i t h i c m a t e r i a l , and historic refuse were found in the emb a n k m e n t from the Park road crossing of the r a i l r o a d bed to
the tip of the tributary, a common s i t u a t i o n for the entrapment of w a s h e d - i n c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l . The most p r o b a b l e source
for this redeposited material is a portion of site 41VV402
w h i c h now l i e s just to the south. S c r a p i n g of the surface
of the a l k a l i flat for construction material for the embankment resulted in the a r t i f i c i a l i s o l a t i o n of the c u l t u r a l
material now eroding from the bed. The only features present
at the site are rock p i l e supports for what was apparently an

B U R N E D ROCK F E A T U R E S

(14)

These sites, whose primary features are burned rock
c o n c e n t r a t i o n s , may be s u b d i v i d e d into two categories based
on the d i s t r i b u t i o n of the burned rock and the t o p o g r a p h i c
l o c a t i o n s of the sites. The burned rock m i d d e n s p r e v i o u s l y
recorded, 41VV214, 220, 222, and 543, and those newly recorded,
41VV370, 372, 394, 395, and 398, are e x t e n s i v e a c c u m u l a t i o n s
of b u r n e d Buda and Georgetown l i m e s t o n e w i t h v a r y i n g admixtures
of other c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l s such as l i t h i c tools, l i t h i c
d e b r i s , and mussel s h e l l . They are g e n e r a l l y situated on
g e n t l e slopes in the upper reaches of both Presa and S e m i n o l e
canyons w i t h easy access to the canyon bottoms, thus to water.
M o r p h o l o g i c a l l y , a l l but 41VV395 and 416 are m o u n d e d concentrations, some with d i s t i n c t c i r c u l a r components. 41VV395
is i n c l u d e d under t h i s general h e a d i n g but here the scattered
d i s t r i b u t i o n of the b u r n e d rock and the accompanying tool kit
i m p l y a different f u n c t i o n . The tools noted or c o l l e c t e d are
c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of m u l t i f u n c t i o n a l camp a c t i v i t i e s ; dart p o i n t s ,
k n i v e s , gouges and scrapers p r e d o m i n a t e (Fig. 23) with cores,
flakes, battered c o b b l e s and f l a k i n g d e b r i s common.
The second category of burned rock sites is four loc a l i t i e s where s m a l l hearths are e r o d i n g from the c a l i c h e flats
b o r d e r i n g the canyons (Fig. 19c).
Many of the features rem a i n b u r i e d ; s i t e b o u n d a r i e s were c h a n g e d as erosion exposed
a d d i t i o n a l hearths. Numerous e x a m p l e s of these hearth f i e l d s

41VV214 consists of three b u r n e d rock m i d d e n s on the
lower benches d e s c e n d i n g to Presa Canyon. The uppermost two
rock concentrations are c i r c u l a r and conform to the d e s c r i p tion of t y p i c a l sotol p i t s . The l a r g e s t m i d d e n , closest to
the canyon floor, is more d i s p e r s e d downslope and forms two
oval adjacent mounds. F l i n t d e b r i s is v i s i b l e but the heavy

and a s m a l l , b o r d e r i n g oak grove - obscures m u c h of the
c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l . Tools noted are one flake scraper, one
d r i l l fragment, three biface and two u n i f a c e fragments, and
one Abatoto dart point. This site is m o r p h o l o g i c a l l y more
intact than most of those of this type recorded d u r i n g the

assessment of burned rock m i d d e n m o r p h o l o g y .
41VV220
This site was d e s c r i b e d by Parsons in 1962 as a s m a l l
burned rock m i d d e n occupying an area of approximately 3/4
acre on the first terrace a b o v e Presa Canyon o n e - h a l f m i l e
downstream of 41VV214, and was plotted on a 15' USGS quadr a n g l e map at a l o c a t i o n just upstream from B l a c k Cave and
adjacent to the r i g h t b a n k w i n d m i l l . The site records h a v e
been corrected to show 41VV220 as s p i l l i n g onto the canyon
floor from the lower s l o p e of the north (right) bank on the
t h i r d bend downstream from Vaquero Shelter and on the first
bend upstream from 41VV212, a d i s t a n c e of a b o u t 400 m.
T h i s l a r g e burned rock m i d d e n is v i r t u a l l y obscured by
a dense growth of oak trees and thorny understory. The site
is composed of burned Buda and Georgetown l i m e s t o n e w i t h
a c c o m p a n y i n g mussel s h e l l fragments a n d l i t h i c d e b r i s . O n e

forms the canyon w a l l . No d i a g n o s t i c artifacts were found.
This site is subjected to h i g h water w a s h i n g ; the conc o m i t a n t edge erosion has resulted in c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l d i s persed across the canyon floor. The m a i n body of the site

scattered burned rock, f l i n t flakes, and fragmentary mussel
s h e l l . The erosive effect of the h i g h water w a s h i n g of Presa
Canyon can be seen in the scatterings of c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l
across the canyon floor. H i g h water marks on the s h a l l o w overhang a b o v e the pools i n d i c a t e d a two meter rise after a

The permanent pools under the shelter of t h i s s h a l l o w

P a i n t e d Canyon. No traces of the p a i n t were found on the

at 41VV72 and the s c o u r i n g action of flood-borne g r a v e l s

debitage, unifacial and bifacial tool fragments, and at
least four dart p o i n t bases, p r i m a r i l y of the En.6oi type.
This debris extends east across the rim to an area designated
as B because of the recovery of six s m a l l arrow points ( F i g .
22e-j) w i t h i n a 3 m. diameter. The disturbed remains of a
p o s s i b l e c i r c u l a r stone a l i g n m e n t c o n t a i n e d two of the s m a l l

H i s t o r i c d e b r i s is scattered across the site and the p i l e s of
stone may be associated w i t h the use of 41VV226 in modern times.
The h i s t o r i c use is e v i d e n c e d by the d r y - l a i d masonry wall
across the front of the shelter and the recent p a i n t i n g s on

Burned Rock Hearths

(4)

41VV376
Six hearths of Buda and Georgetown limestone (Fig. 19c)
are eroding from the c a l i c h e flat on the east bank of S e m i n o l e
Canyon about 600 m. south of U.S. 90. The topographic situation
is s i m i l a r to that of sites 41VV402, 418 and 542 on the west bank
of the canyon - the hearths and l i t h i c material is scattered
across the flat between a cima of Buda l i m e s t o n e and the
heads of two west-flowing tributary canyons. The site was
d i v i d e d into three areas, A-C, for c o n v e n i e n c e because of .the
d i s t a n c e between features. No difference in f u n c t i o n is i m p l i e d
by this d i v i s i o n .
Area A c o n t a i n s two h e a r t h s ; one is a 2.5 x 2 m. o v a l ,
the other a larger rectangle 4 x 2.2 m. The hearths are about
16 m. a p a r t ; the eastern park fence bisects t h i s area. The
associated l i g h t l i t h i c scatter i n c l u d e d two cores, flakes and
a biface fragment. Seventy-five meters to the south, in Area
B, three hearths primarily of Buda limestone p a r a l l e l the
park road. Two are c i r c u l a r and a v e r a g e 3.2 and 2.4 m. in
d i a m e t e r . The t h i r d is m u c h s m a l l e r , .8 x 2 m. A s s o c i a t e d
l i t h i c s i n c l u d e flakes, one b i f a c e fragment, and one En-6ci
dart p o i n t base. Area C is one scattered hearth of Georgetown
l i m e s t o n e with some Buda and t a b u l a r sandstone fragments,
a p p r o x i m a t e l y 250 m. south of the m a i n body of the site. F l i n t
debris extends into the o c o t i l l o forest to the west. The entire
s i t e area is deflated and m u c h of the c u l t u r a l material is exposed in erosional r i l l s .
41VV402, the Hawktrap Site
One of the n o t a b l e features a l o n g the park t r a i l l e a d i n g
to the Rio G r a n d e is a t a l l post erected atop a k i d n e y - s h a p e d
c i m a of Buda l i m e s t o n e . This post o r i g i n a l l y supported the
hawk trap for which this site is named. The site location is
best d e s c r i b e d as e n c i r c l i n g the northern l o b e of t h i s outcrop and extending across the flat to the head of the R8
tributary on the western bank of S e m i n o l e Canyon. A l t h o u g h
cultural material is continuous, the site was d i v i d e d into
Areas A and B because of p o s s i b l e f u n c t i o n a l differences.
Area A contains at least seven hearths and three hearth
remnants of burned Buda l i m e s t o n e e r o d i n g from, or exposed on,

o f t h e h i l l . T h e a c c o m p a n y i n g e x t e n s i v e l i t h i c d e b r i s consists
of f l a k e s , b l a d e s , biface fragments, dart p o i n t fragments, and
core remnants of variously colored cherts. These materials
are most e v i d e n t in e r o s i o n a l r i l l s caused by runoff from the
h i l l . Temporally d i a g n o s t i c artifacts i n c l u d e one Pa.nda.ie., two
Lang&iy, and one VdtmLLLa.^ dart p o i n t bases. One Pi^d-iz arrow
p o i n t was found on the southern p e r i p h e r y .
Area B is the portion of the site west and north of the
h i l l . This area is not marked by a gap in the l i t h i c scatter
but it does seem to reflect less domestic use and more e v i d e n c e
of l i t h i c r e d u c t i o n . Three scatters of b u r n e d B u d a l i m e s t o n e
were plotted but the p r e d o m i n a n t artifacts are cores, core
remnants, and flakes. One Monte.lt and one possibly reworked
ffi-io dart p o i n t s , and one broken d r i l l fragment were found in
the central portion of this area; one Pa.nda.lz dart point on
the s l o p e of the h i l l south of the concentrated m a t e r i a l seems
more of an isolated find.
It is p r o b a b l e that this site once extended across the
flat from tributary R8 to R9. Construction of the r a i l r o a d
resulted in the artificial separation of materials now recorded
as 41VV402 and 541.
41VV418
The site is just now e r o d i n g from the c a l i c h e flat between
the B u d a outcrops on the west bank of S e m i n o l e and a s m a l l

of the w a l k i n g trail is 80 m. south and site 41VV542 is 200 m.
northeast.
41VV418 is an e x c e l l e n t e x a m p l e of the effects of the
d e g r a d a t i o n process now affecting these c a l i c h e flats. The
area had been i n t e n s i v e l y surveyed d u r i n g the 1980 f i e l d season
and no features were apparent. After a heavy rain in May, 1982,
three h e a r t h s were exposed in a g u l l y r u n n i n g from a flattopped h i l l to the s m a l l t r i b u t a r y . L i t h i c d e b r i s was a l s o
noted but no tools or temporal d i a g n o s t i c s were found.
The area of the s i t e , e s t i m a t e d from surface exposure
is probably considerably less than the actual extent. Erosional

Recorded in 1978 by Gary Moore for TPWD, the site was
then d e s c r i b e d as a b u r n e d rock r i n g m i d d e n w i t h three adjacent hearths. The s i t e is on the west bank of S e m i n o l e Canyon

south of 41VV402. R e e v a l u a t i o n of the site in 1981 extended
the b o u n d a r i e s from the f i s h - t a i l end of the R6 and R7 t r i b u taries to the base of the low f r i n g i n g h i l l s . West of the
park road w h i c h traverses the o r i g i n a l l y recorded features,
the s i l t y clay s e d i m e n t s are deep. B u r i e d b u r n e d rock conc e n t r a t i o n s are just e m e r g i n g from the d e f l a t e d surface and
a r e exposed i n r i l l s a n d g u l l i e s . F i v e l a r g e l y b u r i e d hearths
and two l a r g e r concentrations were p l o t t e d . Scattered chert
flakes, biface fragments, the bases of an Early A r c h a i c dart

Less l i t h i c material is exposed here than at the adjacent
41VV402. E r o s i o n is less severe and it may be a s s u m e d that
much of the cultural material remains b u r i e d .
HISTORIC SITES (8)

The l o c a t i o n of that water source is u n d e t e r m i n e d but it seems
most p r o b a b l e that both the s p r i n g (41VV397) and the permanent
pools (41VV72) were exploited to some degree. Access with
horse-drawn v e h i c l e s w o u l d be most f e a s i b l e at the former and

41VV368
The dam (Fig. 19d) from w h i c h Presa Canyon takes its
name was constructed across the head of the canyon ca. 1908.
The d a t i n g of this structure is from the account of John
Z u b e r b u e l e r whose father E m i l b u i l t it shortly after a c q u i r i n g
this portion of the ranch from his father in 1906.
The 40
i n . h i g h dam was constructed of n a t u r a l l i m e s t o n e b l o c k s
mortared w i t h concrete. The structure is 4 ft. w i d e at the
base; the northern s i d e is i r r e g u l a r l y constructed; the
southern is s t e p p e d . The dam was effective and h e l d water
throughout most of the year, backing it up beyond the present
l i m i t s of the Park, u n t i l it was destroyed by the m a s s i v e
flood of 1954.
Twenty-nine ft. of the eastern end s t i l l
stand. No attempt was made to r e b u i l d it b e c a u s e , by then,
w i n d m i l l s were p r o v i d i n g for most of the stock w a t e r i n g needs.
41VV375
An e x t e n s i v e scatter of h i s t o r i c d e b r i s and the footings
of at l e a s t four h i s t o r i c structures lie on the east b a n k of
Seminole Canyon, 100 m. south of U.S. 90. The site is bounded
on the east by the park road, on the north by the stone p o l e
supports of an old t e l e g r a p h l i n e , on the west by S e m i n o l e
Canyon, and on the south by an u n n a m e d tributary. L i m e s t o n e

The h i s t o r i c d e b r i s at t h i s site is very s i m i l a r to that

cattle d r i v e s and m i l i t a r y encampments in the general area
but the extent of 41VV375 seems more a p p r o p r i a t e to the
l a r g e r a i l r o a d camps of 1882.
41VV396
A mixed scatter of h i s t o r i c and p r e h i s t o r i c artifacts
covers the knoll which saps the interfluvial d i v i d e between
the first (R13) and the second (R12) t r i b u t a r i e s to S e m i n o l e
Canyon on the west bank, 300 m. south of U.S. 90. This site
is directly above and between 41VV72 to the east and 41VV397,
the collapsed w i n d m i l l , to the west, and is only 60 m. south
of a prehistoric site, 41VV395.
The historic component contains artifacts s i m i l a r to
those found on the east bank of S e m i n o l e Canyon at 41VV375 tin cans, a flattened tin canteen, fragments of hand-blown
bottles, m i l k g l a s s , earthenware, a n d some u n i q u e i t e m s :
a metal heel tap with a cut-out heart design, a harmonica
part, and a piece of a coffee g r i n d e r . P r e h i s t o r i c m a t e r i a l
is p r i m a r i l y cores, core fragments, and primary f l a k e s . One
dart point base of u n d e f i n e d type was found.
The h i s t o r i c m a t e r i a l is probably refuse from r a i l r o a d
construction worker c a m p s ; the p r e h i s t o r i c m a t e r i a l is i n d i c a t i v e of l i t h i c r e d u c t i o n , perhaps of raw m a t e r i a l from 41VV393,
the quarry w h i c h l i e s only a few h u n d r e d meters to the north.

The tower of a c o l l a p s e d w i n d m i l l stands a s t r i d e a small
spring in the R12 tributary, just south of 41VV226. The first
structure was b u i l t by Pat S u l l i v a n , who l e a s e d the ranch from
Patty W i l k i n s from 1920 to 1930 (McCarson n.d.). Two sets of
b l a d e s attest to the r e b u i l d i n g of the structure.
Of the two m i l l s for w h i c h there are r e m a i n s , the e a r l i e r
was an open twin back-geared "Perkins Steel" made by the
P e r k i n s W i n d M i l l a n d E n g i n e Company o f M i s h a w a k a , I n d i a n a , ca. 1915-1920. This is a c o m p a r a t i v e l y rare m i l l

to have functioned as a forge for the railroad (Ralph, in

first, C & I, was made by Cunningham and Ihmsen, Pittsburg
between 1865 and 1879 (Toulouse 1971: 132-33). A MGCo is
the mark of the Modes Glass Company, L o u i s v i l l e , Kentucky
a r o u n d 1880 (Toulouse 1971: 360-61; 323-24). The function
of the structure as a s a l o o n has not been h i s t o r i c a l l y documented but is suggested by the p r e p o n d e r a n c e of bottles in
the refuse and by the p u r p l e shot glass found here and put
on d i s p l a y by TPWD in the Visitors Center.
Adjacent to the r e c t a n g u l a r ruins are at l e a s t two

T e m p o r a l l y d i a g n o s t i c artifacts range in age from A r c h a i c
through the Late P r e h i s t o r i c . From one 5 m. area, two steeply
b e v e l e d end scrapers (Fig. 22f), one arrow p o i n t base, two
dart p o i n t bases, and the brass t r i g g e r g u a r d from a flintlock rifle were recorded, a typical mixture of all ages of
m a t e r i a l , common to this interfluve.
Of some interest, but not i n c l u d e d in this s i t e area,
are several p i l e s of t a b l u a r l i m e s t o n e b l o c k s on the canyon
rim at the end of a dirt road a b o u t 160 m. east of this
structure. Here the l i m e s t o n e has n a t u r a l l y fractured into
r e l a t i v e l y flat slabs w h i c h would be ideal for construction.
A l t h o u g h no confirming evidence was found, it seems l i k e l y
that these p i l e s were stacked for transport to c o n s t r u c t i o n

On September 6 and 7, and October 4 and 5, 1980, the
easternmost oblong cairn at 41VV364, designated as Cairn A,
was opened by a TAS f i e l d crew u n d e r the authority granted
by State A n t i q u i t y P e r m i t No. 253. Margaret K l u g e , R i c h a r d
P. Watson, Leland C. Bement and I donated our l a b o r , and
Dr. David S. D i b b l e supervised the work. Eighteen working
days were expended on this aspect of the project.
The goal of the i n v e s t i g a t i o n was twofold: in a d d i t i o n
to testing the h y p o t h e s i s that these c a i r n s were mortuary
features, a newly developed stereophotogrammetric process
was used to determine its u t i l i t y in the m a p p i n g of archeological sites. As the system is s t i l l under m o d i f i c a t i o n at
this w r i t i n g , the procedures are summarized p e n d i n g i s s u a n c e

The success of the plotting process is dependent upon the
i n c l u s i o n of six known p o i n t s w i t h i n each p a i r of p h o t o g r a p h s .
Each of the stereopairs is taken c o n s e c u t i v e l y w i t h the same
camera; the distance between stations is r o u g h l y computed at
a ratio of 60 percent of the distance to the object. The
camera was h a n d - h e l d , e l e v a t i o n above the feature was a c h i e v e d

c a i r n was selected for d i s m a n t l e m e n t because it was a p p a r e n t l y
intact and because it was easier to work on the edge of the
site without major d i s t u r b a n c e to the other features. The grid

b l o c k s . Level 2 is the second course of rocks and the s e d i ments to bedrock. This definition, of course, creates uneven
l e v e l s but the a v e r a g e e l e v a t i o n of the top of Level 2 is 27 cm.
below the mean e l e v a t i o n of Level 1.
The limestone blocks w h i c h form the feature are identified
by course. Course 1 is the surface-exposed upper layer of
large blocks (Fig. 24a); Course 2 is the b u r i e d b l o c k s w h i c h
d e f i n e the bottom of Level 1 (Fig 24b); Course 3 is m i s c e l l a neous rocks in the f i l l between the second course and bedrock
(Fig. 24c).
These b l o c k s were a p p a r e n t l y deposited in a p l a n n e d
sequence. The size of the rocks decreases with depth (Fig. 24).
Measurements of m a x i m u m d i m e n s i o n s were taken on the majority
of b l o c k s . The m a x i m u m circumference and the average d i m e n s i o n s
were computed by course. The forty-six blocks considered to be

o n e - h a l f times as large as those in Course 2 (N=59) and twice
the size of Course 3 components (N=21). This size differential
w o u l d be even greater had a l l the s m a l l e r rocks in the bottom of
the cairn been measured. Numerous fist-sized stones were
discarded under the pressure to complete the excavation in the
a l l o t t e d time.
In addition to the increase in smaller rocks with depth,
the bedrock on the southern end of the c a i r n was a c t i v e l y exf o l i a t i n g , probably as a r e s u l t of moisture retention on the
downslope end. Therefore, the configuration of the bedrock in
this section is not that of the o r i g i n a l surface upon w h i c h the
c a i r n was b u i l t (Fig. 24d).
Some i n d i c a t i o n s of c o l l a p s e were noted in the second
course. The t i l t of the s l a b s was down and inward toward the
center of the feature. At the far southern end, a narrow fissure, r u n n i n g p a r a l l e l to the canyon r i m , was u n c o v e r e d . F i l l
of t h i s crack was removed to the depth of a trowel; bottom was
not reached.
C A I R N FILL
The upper 5 - 10 cm. was a consolidated root mat, p r i m a r i l y
composed of grass and resurrection-type p l a n t s . The roots of
l e a t h e r p l a n t s crisscrossed the entire i n t e r i o r of the feature,
i n t e r l a c i n g the l i m e s t o n e b l o c k s .
The s e d i m e n t s were s t r u c t u r e l e s s and f r i a b l e w i t h a h i g h e r
organic content than was found in the a b u t t i n g trench. The
i n c r e a s e d clay content w i t h d e p t h was a p p a r e n t , e s p e c i a l l y in
screening. No d e f i n i t e a n i m a l burrows were detected; one c i r c u lar dark stain 5 cm. in d i a m e t e r , possibly a snake hole, was
recorded in the central p o r t i o n i m m e d i a t e l y adjacent to the
second projectile point r e m o v e d .
E l e v e n soil s a m p l e s were taken from w i t h i n and i m m e d i a t e l y
adjacent to the c a i r n . Two more were c o l l e c t e d from a l o c a t i o n

of Economic Geology, The University of Texas at Austin, for
p h o s p h a t e a n a l y s i s . An acid-extraction t e c h n i q u e was used to
c a l c u l a t e the percentage of fixed c a l c i u m p h o s p h a t e s . No determination of p o s s i b l e phosphates fixed with iron typical in
a c i d i c s o i l s was made; the pH of the f i l l samples ranged from
7.6 to 8.0, a l l m i l d l y a l k a l i n e . The six samples, two from
Level 1 and two from Level 2 of the cairn and one from each l e v e l
of the a b u t t i n g trench, all register v i r t u a l l y the same l e v e l of
phosphates (Table 7). The two samples from outside the site area
contained less than one-third as much.

THE ARTIFACTS, 41VV364

Four projectile points (Fig. 25a-d) and one smooth p e b b l e
were recovered from a 30 cm. area measured horizontally in the
center of the c a i r n . The first one e n c o u n t e r e d , a Sc.att.onn
type arrow point, was recovered 5 cm. below the surface in
Level 1. The p o s s i b i l i t y that this specimen m i g h t be i n t r u s i v e
or d i s p l a c e d m u s t be c o n s i d e r e d ; it was contained w i t h i n a s m a l l
pocket of s n a i l shell fragments suggesting a small cavity into
w h i c h these a n i m a l s crawled and d i e d . The second specimen,
the larger of the two dart p o i n t s , was uncovered <in i-cta in
Level 2 a few centimeters upslope and 14 cm. below the Scalioin
point. The smaller of the dart points was found on the screen
w h i l e processing f i l l from Level 2 in the center of the c a i r n .
The fourth projectile point, a broken Pe.td.lz arrow point, was
recovered d u r i n g the screening of the f i l l in the center of
the cairn from 10 cm. above the bedrock.
Surface c o l l e c t i o n of the site produced six Ent>cn dart
points, one untyped m e d i a l fragment, and one basal fragment of
a p o s s i b l e Gotondn-ina. dart point. Two Ent>oti specimens were
collected on later t r i p s to the site; from their l o c a t i o n
in the area between the dismantled cairn and its i m m e d i a t e
n e i g h b o r it is apparent that they either eroded from the
surface or were washed into that p l a c e s u b s e q u e n t to our
m a i n i n v e s t i g a t i o n of the site. In contrast to the specimens
from the cairn, only two of these surface finds are complete,
f i n i s h e d artifacts.
Numerous secondary and tertiary flakes were found on the
surface and in the f i l l of the cairn and the trench. Laboratory a n a l y s i s confirmed our i n i t i a l f i e l d i m p r e s s i o n that the
size of the l i t h i c d e b r i s decreased w i t h d e p t h ; those recovered
from Level 2 were predominantly small t h i n n i n g flakes. The
h i g h density of l i t h i c debitage on the surface and the numerous
tools recovered is i n d i c a t i v e of i n t e n s i v e use of the area,
probably prior to construction of the cairns as is borne out
by the e q u a l l y h i g h d e n s i t i e s of s i m i l a r d e b r i s w i t h i n the

THE RECONSTRUCTED CAIRN

The construction sequence of the feature can be inferred
from the l a y e r i n g of the courses and the frequency and v o l u m e
of chert flakes recovered from the f i l l . Based on the q u a n t i t y
of f i l l , w h i c h far exceeded the estimates made from the surficial
a p p e a r a n c e , and on the decrease in the size of l i t h i c d e b i t a g e
w i t h d e p t h , the a s s u m p t i o n is made that c o n s i d e r a b l y more s o i l
was present at the site when the cairns were b u i l t . Such a
s i t u a t i o n can be seen at 41VV407 where only the tops of the
u p p e r course of rocks protrude from the ground.
Consideration was g i v e n to the g r a d u a l a c q u i s i t i o n of the
c o n s i d e r a b l e f i l l by r e d e p o s i t i o n from the s l o p e s above and
the e n t r a p m e n t of water or w i n d - b o r n e s e d i m e n t s by the c a i r n .
W h i l e the certainty of t h i s as a factor is demonstrated by the
o n - g o i n g erosion and r e d e p o s i t i o n seen today, it does not
account for the d i r t between the courses - rarely did l i m e s t o n e
meet l i m e s t o n e as w o u l d be expected had sediments s i m p l y been
trapped around the b l o c k s and in the c a i r n . It is also d i f f i c u l t
to i m a g i n e the torrent necessary to deposit heavy artifacts on
the surface of the top of the feature, some 30 to 40 cm. a b o v e
present g r o u n d l e v e l . S o r t i n g o f t h e l i t h i c d e b i t a g e , w i t h t h e
larger flakes near the top, also contradicts the characteristics
of water-borne d e p o s i t i o n .
A s h a l l o w p i t , scraped down to b e d r o c k , w o u l d form the
semblance of a grave. The dirt from the surrounding surface
w h i c h i n c l u d e d l a r g e q u a n t i t i e s o f l i t h i c d e b r i s , a n d numerous
s m a l l rocks first covered the body; then, two layers of progress i v e l y l a r g e r s l a b s served to seal in the corpse and deter
scavengers. Although perhaps not intentional, this mound was
also a g r a v e marker. The t i l t of the s l a b s towards the i n t e r i o r
of the c a i r n c o u l d r e s u l t from c o l l a p s e as t h e i r s u p p o r t , the
body, d e c o m p o s e d .
THE D A T I N G OF 41VV364

Based on the i n c o m p l e t e Pe^d-cz p o i n t , found just a b o v e
bedrock in the heart of the feature, the site is dated to the
Late Prehistoric Period, c.a. A.D. 800 or later. The e i g h t dart
p o i n t s of the En&on type found on the surface and the two Late
A r c h a i c style p o i n t s found w i t h i n the c a i r n o v e r l a p in age
( D i b b l e 1967: 73).
The basal fragment, possibly of a Late Paleoi n d i a n Gotondntna dart p o i n t , was p e r i p h e r a l to the m a i n site
area a n d , e v e n , if the t y p o l o g i c a l a s s i g n m e n t is correct on t h i s

CAIRN A

very fragmentary s p e c i m e n , its r e l a t i o n s h i p to the c a i r n s is
spati a l l y weak.
The two complete dart points recovered from the cairn
contribute l i t t l e to the d a t i n g of the feature but their
presence may i n d i c a t e the folly of a s s u m i n g an A r c h a i c a f f i l i ation on the basis of l i m i t e d m i s c e l l a n e o u s dart point styles.
It may be that the ethnographic reality of the coeval use of
lance and bow is mirrored in the artifacts from Cairn A.
Three of the four projectile points in the cairn are complete specimens. This, and the concentration of these artifacts
in the center of the feature, may suggest purposeful i n c l u s i o n .
Alternatively, they may have simply been part of the surrounding
l i t h i c debris mixed with the earth used to fill the feature.
CONCLUSIONS
The burial function of these features was not confirmed by
the recovery of skeletal material or teeth. However, the h i g h
phosphate l e v e l s , the purposeful construction of the feature,
the recovery of numerous artifacts from the f i l l , and the
archeological and ethnohistorical documentation of s i m i l a r
features in the same topographic setting all conjoin to
support that interpretation.
Until further evidence is acquired to refine or alter this conclusion, it seems the best
explanation for the site.
The sequence of construction proposed and the chronological
placement of these features is based on a sample of one. This
first step into the investigations of mortuary practices during
at least the Late Prehistoric Period can only serve as a basis
for comparison and the conclusions improved by further work.
Only four days were allotted for the investigations at the
site; thus, several tasks were left undone which would have
contributed to the interpretation. The large blocks w h i c h form
the perimeter of the feature were left in place (Fig. 24d) and
only one small a b u t t i n g trench was excavated on the exterior.
If future work is undertaken at this or s i m i l a r sites, a larger
area outside the feature should be opened to see if the fill
characteristics mirror those of the interior. The small trench
yielded numerous tertiary flakes s i m i l a r to those w i t h i n but
no v o l u m e t r i c measurement was made. Some water screening of
the most promising segments of the fill would greatly assist
in i d e n t i f y i n g small fragments of bone or teeth; the natural
exfoliation of the limestone creates l i t e r a l l y hundreds of
small concretions to be examined on the screens.
A d d i t i o n a l investigations into the functions and age span
of this type of site are recommended. Most promising are the
s i m i l a r features at 41VV364 and 407 (See Recommendations Sites W i t h Exceptional Scientific Merit).

u p l a n d and lowland resources. The latter consideration accounts
in part for the c o n c e n t r a t i o n of sites in the u p p e r reaches of
the canyons and a l o n g the most e a s i l y traversed t r i b u t a r y systems. The dearth of prehistoric u t i l i z a t i o n of the u p l a n d s

use of quarry site 41VV219 in comparison to the i n t e n s i v e

may be one e x a m p l e of the effects of t h i s factor.

most i n t e n s i v e l y used area, p r e h i s t o r i c a l 1 y a n d h i s t o r i c a l l y ,
the upper reaches of S e m i n o l e Canyon near the p e r m a n e n t water
sources at 41VV72 and 397. Here a l l resources are h a p p i l y

b r u n t of h i s t o r i c l a n d use.
Seep s p r i n g s , such as those in 41VV83 and 335, also
p r o v i d e d an a l t e r n a t i v e to the canyon bottom water for such
rimrock sites as 41VV336. S i m i l a r seeps are the source of
m u c h of the casual water found in pools along the canyon
floors, such as i n front of 41VV408, or in the m i n o r t r i b u t a r i e s , as by 41VV140.
A c c e s s i b i l i t y is seen as a key d e t e r m i n a n t of u p l a n d l a n d

found at the heads of h a n g i n g t r i b u t a r i e s (i.e. a b o v e 41VV84)
where ascent or descent is precipitous. This preference is
so c o n s i s t e n t that an e x p l a n a t i o n for absence in such a topog r a p h i c setting must be sought. One such location w i t h i n the
Park is on the flats a l o n g the upper western bank of S e m i n o l e
Canyon where historic l a n d use may have o b l i t e r a t e d the e v i d e n c e for p r e h i s t o r i c o c c u p a t i o n . In other i n s t a n c e s , such
sites may r e m a i n b u r i e d under a c c u m u l a t e d s e d i m e n t s as did

CULTURAL RESPONSE AS A D E T E R M I N A N T IN SITE LOCATION

The e v i d e n c e f r o m - s i t e s of the Infierno Phase suggests
that late in prehistory, new people with a distinctly different
m a t e r i a l c u l t u r e entered the Lower Pecos. W i t h the i n t r u s i o n
of these foreign groups, came a preference for h i g h places with
s w e e p i n g v i e w s . Rooted in the e v o l u t i o n of a separate c u l t u r a l
system, this preference was in many ways e n v i r o n m e n t a l l y effic i e n t . If the primary s u b s i s t e n c e base was d e p e n d e n t upon
h u n t i n g , as is suggested by the stone tools, the v a n t a g e p o i n t s
offered a wide perspective on the movements of a n i m a l s , i n c l u d i n g those of other h u m a n s . The d e e p , s t e e p - s i d e d t r i b u t a r i e s
would serve admirably as traps for a n i m a l s drawn to the water
and forage often found there, yet the camps are d i s t a n t e n o u g h
not to a l a r m the prey. A l t h o u g h p r o x i m i t y to water was i m p o r tant, t h e i r storage c a p a b i l i t i e s are better demonstrated than
those of the A r c h a i c p e o p l e , and p e r h a p s somewhat relaxed that
restriction. Ethnographic descriptions of water containers
used by the desert t r i b e s m e n of N o r t h e r n M e x i c o refer to g o u r d s
and b l a d d e r s made of a n i m a l s k i n or i n t e r n a l organs (Griffen
1969: 106), in a d d i t i o n to the c e r a m i c v e s s e l s represented
in the Lower Pecos by a few sherds.
Whether for convenience or cosmology, the majority of the
c a i r n s are a l s o on h i g h p l a c e s , the canyon r i m s . The r e l a t i o n s h i p of the b u i l d e r s of stone c i r c l e s to those of the cairns,
other t h a n in their common p r e d i l i c t i o n for h e i g h t s , is a
question beyond the l i m i t s of current i n f o r m a t i o n .

be related to other c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l . The p a u c i t y of m a t e r i a l s
of t h i s age can not be c o n s i d e r e d as d e f i n i t i v e e v i d e n c e that
there was l i t t l e or no u t i l i z a t i o n of the area. This p o i n t is
further d i s c u s s e d under the I n t e r p r e t a t i o n s of Site Patterns.
The Archaic Period
Only two artifacts of Early A r c h a i c age were i d e n t i f i e d .
The b a s a l p o r t i o n of a Gcwei (Shafer 1963: 64) dart p o i n t was
c o l l e c t e d adjacent to the burned rock m i d d e n s of 41VV370.
A l t h o u g h c a t a l o g u e d under that site n u m b e r , t h i s s p e c i m e n was
on the periphery of the l i t h i c scatter s u r r o u n d i n g the b u r n e d
rock features, in the deflated, cleared corridor along the
Park fence right-of-way. Therefore, its a s s o c i a t i o n w i t h the
features is u n c e r t a i n .
The second Early A r c h a i c dart p o i n t - the basal portion
of a s p e c i m e n s i m i l a r to the Be££ (Sorrow, Shafer and Ross
1967: 12-14) type d a t a b l e in Central Texas to the span 6000
to 7000 B.C. (Prewitt 1981: 11) - was also exposed on the
deflated surface of a b u r n e d rock site, 41VV542.
Despite the scarcity of artifacts c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of t h i s
time p e r i o d , the o c c u p a t i o n of B l a c k Cave t h r o u g h o u t the
Early A r c h a i c is a m p l y demonstrated by the series of r a d i o carbon dates derived from remnant hearths cemented to the
upstream w a l l of the s h e l t e r (Table 6, F i g . 14). The presumed fate of the b u l k of the a s s o c i a t e d m a t e r i a l , erasure
by m a s s i v e e r o s i o n a l events of r e g i o n a l extent, p r o v i d e s one
e x p l a n a t i o n for the p a u c i t y of Early A r c h a i c and P a l e o i n d i a n
o c c u p a t i o n a l d e b r i s t h r o u g h o u t the Lower Pecos.
The earliest time period well-represented in the m a t e r i a l s
recorded is the M i d d l e A r c h a i c . Five Pandaie. dart points,
d a t a b l e to the range from 2100 to 4000 B.C. (Table 2), were
found, but none were in a secure context. One was i m b e d d e d i n
a l u m p of c h a r c o a l - a s h m a t r i x on the h i g h l y d i s r u p t e d surface
of a l a r g e rock shelter, 41VV75, and one was on the lower t a l u s
of a nearby s m a l l s h e l t e r , 41VV141. Two were recorded a d j a c e n t
to the hearths around the c-tmo. at the head of the same s m a l l
t r i b u t a r y (41VV402) and the fifth was c o l l e c t e d from the quarry
s i t e , 41VV405. The l a s t three were p e r i p h e r a l to the m a i n body
of the sites and i m p r e s s i o n i s t i c a l l y a p p e a r to be i s o l a t e d
artifacts.
Interestingly, a l l five ?anda.l& points came from the west
bank of S e m i n o l e Canyon, four of them from sites a l o n g the same s m a l l tributary (R8) and the fifth only a few h u n d r e d
meters d i s t a n t . A l t h o u g h no c o n c l u s i o n s can be d e r i v e d
from the p e r h a p s fortuitous d i s t r i b u t i o n of t h i s early style,
the other t i m e - d i a g n o s t i c s found i n the i m m e d i a t e v i c i n i t y
attest to the l o n g - t e r m use of the sites in t h i s area, 41VV141,

route to m i d - S e m i n o l e Canyon and p r o v i d e s a good e x a m p l e of the
affect of a c c e s s i b i l i t y on p r e h i s t o r i c settlement.
The b u l k of the t i m e - d i a g n o s t i c artifacts noted d u r i n g the
survey are of M i d d l e to Late Archaic age. The numerical supremacy of En-6oi type dart p o i n t s is b i a s e d by the recovery of
e i g h t specimens from 41VV364. As a general rule, all burned
rock m i d d e n s bear e v i d e n c e of a M i d d l e to Late A r c h a i c occupation, perhaps reflecting the hypothesized regional shift toward
economic e x p l o i t a t i o n of the u p l a n d resources (Marmaduke 1978:
272-273). The Park was not d e s i g n e d to incorporate a represent a t i v e s a m p l e of the topography of the area, and l i t t l e of
the true u p l a n d e n v i r o n m e n t is i n c l u d e d w i t h i n its b o u n d s .
However, u p l a n d sites w h i c h were noted or recorded (41VV330,
331, 334 and 420) on access roads to Presa Canyon are very
s i m i l a r to those on the lower slopes and u p l a n d flats within
the Park.
The few temporally d i a g n o s t i c artifacts noted in the
s h e l t e r s of the Park also i n d i c a t e M i d d l e to Late A r c h a i c
o c c u p a t i o n s . The w h o l e c o n t i n u u m was reflected in the a r t i fact a s s e m b l a g e s from Fate B e l l S h e l t e r (Pearce and Jackson
1933; Thomas 1933) but the o n l y type m e n t i o n e d by Taylor (1949a)
in his t r e n c h i n g of 41VV84 is Langtly S-temmed, an early name
for the Langtny and l/a£ 1/eide dart p o i n t s most c o m m o n l y found
in the shelters by this survey.
S i m i l a r l y , all the newly recorded rock s h e l t e r s w i t h rock
art are tentatively assigned to the Pecos River style, therefore to the A r c h a i c Period, or to the Red L i n e a r style w h i c h
is as yet i n s e c u r e l y dated. U n f o r t u n a t e l y , so l i t t l e r e m a i n s
in most of them that c o m p a r i s o n s to the l a r g e r sites are made
d i f f i c u l t . That rock art is to be f o u n d in so many s m a l l
shelters suggests that its execution was not l i m i t e d to cerem o n i a l e v e n t s performed s o l e l y by l a r g e s o c i a l a g g r e g a t e s . If
r i t u a l art, then the ritual was incorporated into everyday life.
The Late Prehistoric Period
The r e s u l t s of t h i s survey and o t h e r i n v e s t i g a t i o n s c a r r i e d
out i n the past few years h a v e b e g u n to p l a c e t h i s period i n a

on the e x c a v a t i o n of rock s h e l t e r s and d e e p l y s t r a t i f i e d
terrace sites, wherein the m a s s i v e A r c h a i c deposits provided
the m a x i m u m a n a l y s i s u n i t s , had so b i a s e d the a c c u m u l a t e d data
that the l i m i t e d e v i d e n c e for the Late Prehistoric was obscured.
The e m e r g i n g refinement of t h i s p e r i o d and the r e d e f i n i t i o n of
its a t t e n d a n t lifeways is d e p e n d e n t u p o n i n f o r m a t i o n gathered
from surface sites not p r e v i o u s l y reported in the r e g i o n .
Of p r i m a r y i m p o r t a n c e to t h i s d i s c u s s i o n is Infierno Camp

small t r i a n g u l a r arrow points, steeply b e v e l e d end scrapers,
ceramics, and p r i s m a t i c b l a d e s ; and a preference for h i g h ,
open camp grounds seems to indicate an intrusion of Plains
I n d i a n s , p e r h a p s A t h a p a s k a n s p e a k e r s , sometime l a t e i n prehistory ( D i b b l e 1978a).
Another trait new to the Lower Pecos c u l t u r a l assemb l a g e s may be the b u i l d i n g of c a i r n s at 41VV364 as mortuary
features, d a t a b l e to the Late Prehistoric Period. W h e t h e r
that a s s i g n m e n t is borne out by other such sites has yet to
be tested.
W i t h only two s i t e s , one camp and one c a i r n site, upon
w h i c h to propose a shift in s e t t l e m e n t patterns or b u r i a l
practices, the current survey was conducted w i t h the goal of
confirming the reoccurance and d i s t r i b u t i o n of these sites
w i t h i n an adjacent area. A l t h o u g h that goal met w i t h some
success, the i n c e p t i o n , d u r a t i o n , and c u l t u r a l i m p a c t of the
proposed i n t r u s i o n has yet to be d e t e r m i n e d . The f o l l o w i n g
s u g g e s t i o n s are hypotheses to be tested by further broad
area! surveys.
Evidence for the Late Prehistoric Period occupation, as
t r a d i t i o n a l l y d e f i n e d , was found in some shelters w i t h i n the
Park - Fate Bell (Pearce and Jackson 1933), 41VV367, a small
s h e l t e r w i t h scanty d e p o s i t s , and 41VV72. A l l c o n t a i n rock
art to a varying degree but only the pictographs at 41VV72
are of the l a t e Red M o n o c h r o m e style. The p o s s i b l y Late
Prehistoric Red Linear style is found in Fate B e l l amidst
a p r o f u s i o n of Pecos R i v e r style art.
The continuity of certain aspects of the subsistence
pattern may be seen in the burned rock u p l a n d sites, for
e x a m p l e , at 41VV402 where the full range of M i d d l e A r c h a i c
to Late P r e h i s t o r i c styles was seen. More g r a p h i c a l l y , 41VV448 at the head of nearby P a i n t e d Canyon and close to the
l a r g e Red M o n o c h r o m e p a n e l at 41VV78, is a c l a s s i c r i n g m i d d e n
and hearth site where the only projectile p o i n t s recorded are
Pe/id^z arrow p o i n t s , a h a l l m a r k of the Late P r e h i s t o r i c Period
over broad areas of Texas.
A l l the stone c i r c l e s and o b l o n g c a i r n s are t e n t a t i v e l y
a s s i g n e d to the Late P r e h i s t o r i c Period. These sites i n d i cate a shift in l o c a t i o n a l preference sometime d u r i n g the
later phases of the period. The cairn d i s m a n t l e d at 41VV364
is d a t a b l e to the Late Prehistoric based on the recovery from
the f i l l of a Pe,fid^iz arrow p o i n t , but as yet the date of this
presumed mortuary practice has not been e s t a b l i s h e d . Simil a r l y , at the stone c i r c l e site 41VV409, two fragments of
one Peicicz p o i n t were peripheral to the main site area. By

Four of these are s i m i l a r to
the PeAcUz style, but in order to a v o i d any i m p l i c a t i o n s ofa genetic r e l a t i o n s h i p to local forms, they are currently
considered as untyped. 41VV369 consists solely of one intact
stone circle at the head of Presa Canyon just upstream from
Vaquero Shelter, the historic rock art site. No associated
cultural material was found but the construction t e c h n i q u e
is identical to that of Infierno Camp. 41VV365,' an open

A p r e l i m i n a r y c o m p a r i s o n of the ceramics from Infierno
Camp, 41VV365, J a v e l i n a Bluff (McClurkan 1968), and the
D e v i l ' s Mouth Site (Johnson 1961, 1964; Sorrow 1968) was
a u g m e n t e d by the d o n a t i o n of a c o l l e c t i o n from 41VV424, a
site reported in the TARL files (Word n.d.). The pottery is
calcite-tempered or brown p l a i n ware with a dark core. It
is not s i m i l a r to the m i c a c e o u s pottery g e n e r a l l y c o n s i d e r e d
to be t y p i c a l l y A p a c h e a n . The closest affinities w i t h i n this
sample apparent on a gross level are between 41VV424 and 41VV365 (Neely 1980). P e t r o g l y p h i c a n a l y s i s of a s a m p l e of
sherds from each site is currently underway but of more than
passing interest is a report of pottery sites and the a n a l y s i s
of those sherds from the A b i l e n e area (Ray 1935; Griffin
1935). The l a r g e w h i t e i n c l u s i o n s d e s c r i b e d for that pottery
are the most striking superficial characteristic of the Lower
Pecos sherds .

of the old ways is seen in the shelters and burned rock
middens but intrusions are apparent in the introduction of
a f u l l y d e v e l o p e d art style, the Red Monochrome, and in the

a b a s i c a l l y u n c h a n g i n g economy augmented by the i n t r o d u c t i o n
of the bow and arrow. Sometime around A.D. 600, arrow points
g r a d u a l l y appear in the a r c h e o l o g i c a l d e p o s i t s in the stratig r a p h i c sense and co-exist w i t h Late A r c h a i c style dart
p o i n t s for h u n d r e d s of years. This presence, in the context
of s u b s i s t e n c e d e b r i s w h i c h r e m a i n e d b a s i c a l l y u n c h a n g e d
throughout the Archaic, formed the basis for the proposed
c o n t i n u a t i o n of e s t a b l i s h e d lifeways u n t i l h i s t o r i c times.
How the Red Monochrome rock art and the practice of c a i r n
b u r i a l affect t h i s perception of a s t a b l e system has yet to
be e x p l a i n e d but l i m i t e d data suggests i n t r o d u c t i o n of both
traits from the north and west, possibly during a c l i m a t i c
i n t e r v a l s i m i l a r to that seen at Bonfire Shelter d u r i n g the
Archaic Period ca. 2500 years ago.
Sometime late in prehistory, now estimated to be pos.tA.D. 1400 to as late as h i s t o r i c t i m e s , an i n t r u s i v e group

the repercussions of the w h i t e man, can only be suggested
after more secure d a t i n g . The d u r a t i o n of t h e i r stay is
only reflected by the refuse of some of the features, and
t h e i r i m p a c t on the r e s i d e n t p o p u l a t i o n is u n d e t e r m i n e d .
The Historic Period
U n t i l the d a t i n g of the o c c u p a t i o n of Infierno Camp is

in the Park d u r i n g h i s t o r i c times is the reported recovery
of four metal arrow points from B l a c k Cave (Parsons 1962)
and the w e l l - k n o w n p a n e l at Vaquero S h e l t e r (Fig. 7). One
other p o s s i b l e a b o r i g i n a l h i s t o r i c artifact from the Park

SITE PATTERNING

A m e r i c a n m a n u f a c t u r e or use is not known.
The presence of the E u r o p e a n , s p o r a d i c a l l y represented
by the a d v e n t of the early explorers (Schroeder and Matson
1965) and the sometimes f u t i l e attempts by the Army to
pacify the area (Dolman 1981), left no d i s c e r n a b l e mark on
the Park until the advent of the railroad era in 1881. All
the historic sites of Euro-American o r i g i n are of this age
or later, and a l l but two are d i s t i n c t l y the consequence of
r a i l r o a d construction. These sites are a l l in the upper
reaches of the Park or p a r a l l e l i n g the abandoned railroad
embankment. The camps w h i c h p r o b a b l y housed the laborers
were located on the east and west bank of S e m i n o l e Canyon
just above the permanent water s u p p l i e s of 41VV72 and 397.
Their distance from the e m b a n k m e n t is a t t r i b u t e d by Patterson (1980) to the use of 41VV226 as a powder magazine. Other
structures attendant on the railroad are found at 41VV414,
540 (a forge), 544 (the Old Saloon Ruins), and the newly
restored b a k i n g oven (41VV588) moved into the Park in 1980
(Patterson 1980) .
The two other h i s t o r i c sites recorded symbolize the
rancher's t e c h n o l o g i c a l d r i v e for water. 41VV368, the dam
at the head of Presa Canyon, was b u i l t in the first decade
of t h i s century as a response to i n s u f f i c i e n t water to m a i n t a i n l i v e s t o c k . 41VV397, t h e c o l l a p s e d w i n d m i l l just south
of U.S. 90, is roughly e q u i v a l e n t in age to the d a m .
Unfortunately, the most pronounced impact of the techn o l o g i c a l age was upon the rock art in the shelters c l o s e s t
to the r a i l r o a d . Here g r a f f i t i d a t a b l e to that era has
marred every site. The more remote s h e l t e r s were not beyond
the range of such v a n d a l i s m . B l a c k C a v e , in the far reaches
of Presa Canyon, has the date 1884 i n s c r i b e d on a b o u l d e r .
Had the practice of a d d i n g o n e ' s name to the a r t i s t i c s i g n a tures of the past been p r a c t i c e d only d u r i n g the r a i l r o a d
p e r i o d , it c o u l d now be l o o k e d u p o n as a h i s t o r i c artifact.
S a d l y , our current society has not yet outgrown that c h i l d l i k e urge and the modern slang found in the shelters along the
R i o Grande dates that graffiti to today. Somehow, the
i n s c r i p t i o n s of names and dates by i t i n e r a n t workers of 100
years 'ago are more a c c e p t a b l e than the e x p l i c a t i v e s preferred
by more recent passersby.
I N T E R P R E T A T I O N S OF SITE PATTERNS

The i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of s i t e p a t t e r n i n g must take into
consideration the effects of differential preservation of
c u l t u r a l deposits. Factors w h i c h h a v e most i n f l u e n c e d the
s a m p l e of p r e h i s t o r i c sites w i t h i n the Park are both normal
and accelerated n a t u r a l processes, such as erosion and s e d i m e n t a t i o n , and the d i s t u r b a n c e s caused by modern v a n d a l i s m or

construction.
The primary effects of modern man on the spatial distribution lie in the total eradication of sites which results
from major construction, such as that of the railroad which
a r t i f i c i a l l y separated 41VV402 and 541, assumed to h a v e once
been one large site. Intra-site distribution is a by-product
of fences and livestock enclosures; this is illustrated at
41VV371, 374, and 404. In the m a i n , however, the Park has
remained undisturbed by major modifications, e s p e c i a l l y along
Presa and the lower reaches of S e m i n o l e Canyon.
Natural processes have taken a greater toll throughout
prehistory and history. It may be presumed that the sites
known today are only a fraction of those once present, and
that this sample is not representative of the range which
once existed. The catastrophic floods of recent and e a r l i e r
times have eradicated any hope of determining the full extent
of prehistoric utilization of the lower elevations. The
effect of the most recent floods is demonstrated by the comparison of descriptions of sites at i n i t i a l recording and
those of our reevaluations . M i d d e n deposits reported at
41VV72 (Jackson 1938: 221; K i r k l a n d 1937b: 113), 41VV145
(Graham and Davis n.d.), 41VV212 (Gebhard 1965), and 41VV222
(Parsons n.d., 1962) are now seriously depleted or vanished.
Similarly, the association between low-lying middens and
nearby shelters is no longer demonstrable. The corrosive
effect of water-borne sand and gravel on rock art is notable
at 41VV72, 145, 212, and perhaps, 230. The washout of rock
shelter midden deposits, seen at 41VV73, 76, 139, 140, 230,
335, and 545, predates the first normal recording of the sites.
The contention that many more low-lying sites were
occupied than are now recorded is borne out by e v i d e n c e from
two rock shelters in the Park. Jackson (1938: 222) briefly
mentions a site described as a shelter with midden deposits
and pictographs, and plots the site on the west bank of Seminole Canyon upstream and adjacent to 41VV230, Lookout Shelter.
The latter, a p i c t o g r a p h site illustrated by K i r k l a n d , is
now often i n u n d a t e d by Amistad Reservoir. Both of these
sites were omitted from Graham and Davis 1 1958 inventory despite their familiarity with Jackson's reference. A d d i t i o n a l l y ,
Graham and Davis had a most knowledgeable informant in W.E.
(Ed) McCarson, who had also assisted both Jackson and K i r k l a n d .
The l o g i c a l c o n c l u s i o n is that both Lookout Shelter and its
neighboring pictograph site had been destroyed prior to 1958.
The occupation of a second shelter w i t h i n the Park is
inferred from much more circumstantial evidence. A large
shelter at the confluence of the Rio Grande and the westernmost Park tributary is now barren. However, on the rim above
l i e s the dense l i t h i c scatter recorded as 41VV407 w h i c h includes M i d d l e to Late Archaic dart point fragments, characteristically found above occupied shelters. Testimony to

the s u i t a b i l i t y of the site for c a m p i n g is the modern l i t t e r
deposited by boaters on Lake A m i s t a d . The w a l l s are of the
powdery consistency seen, for e x a m p l e , at 41VV84 (Fig. 9b)
and pic to graphs w o u l d r a p i d l y erode. The gentle slope of
the floor is such that h i g h water w o u l d be c h a n n e l e d a l o n g
the w a l l s , g a i n i n g momentum s u f f i c i e n t to f l u s h out c u l t u r a l
deposits. It seems u n l i k e l y that t h i s commodious shelter
w o u l d have been ignored in favor of the s m a l l e r sites located
further upstream on this same tributary and a l o n g the Rio
Grande since access to the Rio Grande flood p l a i n a l o n g t h i s
stretch is only granted by a trail a few meters away.
The catastrophic floods of recent times are often considered a secondary effect of modern l a n d - u s e practices,
most notably o v e r g r a z i n g and the s u b s e q u e n t increase in
erosion. The a r c h e o l o g i c a l and g e o m o r p h o l o g i c a l e v i d e n c e ,
however, now demonstrates that f l o o d i n g affected the archeol o g i c a l record throughout prehistory (Patton and D i b b l e 1982;
Kochel and Baker 1982). The c u t - a n d - f i l l sequence i n d i c a t e d
by hearth remnants at B l a c k Cave (pp. 73 - 77) i l l u s t r a t e s
one b i a s in the c u l t u r a l s e q u e n c e , -i. e.. the q u e s t i o n a b l e
sparsity of P a l e o i n d i a n and Early A r c h a i c o c c u p a t i o n of the
region. From the strati grap-hi c position and radiocarbon
d a t i n g of these features - the r e m a i n s of o n c e - e x t e n s i v e
c u l t u r a l deposits now a p p a r e n t only as remnants cemented to
the s h e l t e r w a l l s 2 m. above the current floor - two c u t t i n g
and two f i l l i n g episodes are i n d i c a t e d . The first c u t t i n g
e p i s o d e occurred p r i o r to ca. 6800 B.P. and reduced the
previous fill to the l e v e l of an a n g u l a r unconformity underl a i n b y l a t e P l e i s t o c e n e s p a l l s . C u l t u r a l d e p o s i t s then
a c c u m u l a t e d for at least 1300 years (Table 6) u n t i l a second
erosional event cut even deeper into the shelter f i l l ,
l e a v i n g only these few features p a r t i a l l y intact. Later
d e p o s i t i o n of M i d d l e and Late A r c h a i c c u l t u r a l m a t e r i a l was
u n d o u b t e d l y subjected to e q u a l l y drastic w a s h i n g but the
small d e p o s i t of that age that r e m a i n s a l l o w s no estimate
of p o s s i b l e time(s) of s u b s e q u e n t erosion. B l a c k Cave c l e a r l y
demonstrates tha<t Early A r c h a i c o c c u p a t i o n of the site extended over a c o n s i d e r a b l e period of time and that, except
for the preservation of these traces, the e v i d e n c e was o b l i terated by severe erosion. It may be assumed that any Paleoi n d i a n d e p o s i t s w o u l d h a v e been s i m i l a r l y eradicated by the
pre-6800 B.P. t r u n c a t i o n of the f i l l .
The r e g i o n a l extent of these processes is to be seen in
s i m i l a r s p a l l remnants at numerous l o c a t i o n s such as E a g l e
Cave, Fate B e l l Annex, Panther Cave and along the lower
reaches of Presa Canyon, and may correlate w i t h m a s s i v e
flood l e v e l s at Arenosa Shelter between 9550 and 5360 r a d i o carbon years ago (Patton and D i b b l e 1982: F i g . 5). The
i m p l i c a t i o n s of t h i s v a r i a b l e p r e s e r v a t i o n may thus be extended to the r e g i o n a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the e a r l i e s t occup a t i o n s of the Lower Pecos. For e x a m p l e , had a c c i d e n t a l

not p r e v a i l e d at Bonfire S h e l t e r , the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of
Lower Pecos P a l e o i n d i a n lifeways w o u l d be based on the
evidence from the Devil's Mouth Site and Baker Cave where
deposits s l i g h t l y later than those at Bonfire yielded no
indications of an economy based on big game hunting. Thus,
the model for t h i s period w o u l d read l i k e that for Central
and South Texas where the s u b s i s t e n c e base is b e l i e v e d to
have been g e n e r a l i z e d h u n t i n g and g a t h e r i n g . A l t h o u g h Bonfire is u n i q u e in the region, a site of such antiquity
demonstrates that the organizational ability to effect mass
slaughter was part of the social system at this early date
(Dibble 1970: 254).
Secondly, the location of the site, on
the southernmost fringe of the known d i s t r i b u t i o n of mass
k i l l sites, incorporates the Lower Pecos into a c o n t i n e n t wide complex of cultural traits. To assume that the scarcity
of Paleoindian material i m p l i e s only l i g h t u t i l i z a t i o n of
the region by non-resident bands is to ignore the numerous
locations a l o n g the entrenched canyons s u i t a b l e for s i m i l a r
stampede s l a u g h t e r ; erosional events such as those i n d i c a t e d
at B l a c k Cave w o u l d h a v e effectively eradicated all traces
of such k i l l s .
Similarly, the second cutting episode evidenced at Black
Cave reduced the Early Archaic component to a few remnant
features. T h r o u g h o u t the region, Early A r c h a i c deposits are
restricted to the shelters a b o v e the reach of h i g h waters
(e.g., H i n d s Cave, Baker Cave, E a g l e Cave, Conejo Shelter)
or on the mainstem rivers where the force of flooding is
less than in the restrictive tributary canyons (e.g., D e v i l ' s
Mouth, D e v i l ' s Rockshelter, Arenosa Shelter). Those in lowl y i n g sites, such as B l ac k Cave, were l o n g ago destroyed.
As the canyons cut, only floods of greater m a g n i t u d e had the
capacity to flush the shelters. Thus, the p r o b a b i l i t y of
M i d d l e and Late Archaic components s u r v i v i n g is greater.
Long-term environmental deterioration, accelerated by
historic land modifications, has also affected the u p l a n d
sites, a l t h o u g h less d r a m a t i c a l l y . The c u l t u r a l material
deposited over the m i l l e n i a now rests on a common deflated
surface and sheetwash redeposition of artifacts results in
additional mixture. A l t h o u g h sites are not completely
eradicated, their temporal r e l a t i o n s h i p to other sites at
any g i v e n point is rendered a m b i g u o u s . The four dart point
fragments a t t r i b u t a b l e to Late P a l e o i n d i a n or Early A r c h a i c
types were a l l found on severely deflated surfaces, either
as isolated artifacts or in the v i c i n i t y of cultural material
characteristic of M i d d l e and Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric
occupations. It should be noted here that s a m p l i n g bias undoubtedly resulted from our recording methods. Areas of
dense c u l t u r a l d e b r i s were m u c h more thoroughly searched
for d i a g n o s t i c artifacts, thus i n c r e a s i n g the p r o b a b i l i t y
of f i n d i n g a greater range of s p e c i m e n s .

SITE PATTERNING

Whether because of recency or frequency, the majority
of the sites w i t h i n the Park have M i d d l e to Late A r c h a i c
components and a more c o m p l e t e d i s t r i b u t i o n a l pattern is
granted by the larger s a m p l e size. From the results of this
survey, it is a p p a r e n t that site density is much greater than
i n d i c a t e d by p r e v i o u s recordings. Those sites i n c l u d e
i n h a b i t e d rock s h e l t e r s , rock art sites, and open burned
rock m i d d e n s . A l l of the sites a t t r i b u t a b l e to the A r c h a i c
Period can be a s s i g n e d to one or more of those three catagories. G i v e n the duration of the Archaic, the sheer l e n g t h
of occupation would expectedly w e i g h t the p r o b a b i l i t i e s of
i d e n t i f y i n g residues of that period. S i m i l a r l y , the paucity
of Late P a l e o i n d i a n and Early A r c h a i c m a t e r i a l s seems partially attributable to differential preservation or to burial
by subsequent o c c u p a t i o n a l d e b r i s . Despite the u n q u a n t i f i e d
effect of these factors on the representativeness of the site
inventory, the trend towards a h i g h e r density of sites and
i n t e n s i t y of o c c u p a t i o n in the later p h a s e s of the A r c h a i c
(Alexander 1974; M a r m a d u k e 1978) is a p p a r e n t l y reflected in
the sites from S e m i n o l e Canyon. Whether this trend is illusory and a product of p r e s e r v a t i o n a l s e l e c t i v i t y , rather
than increased p o p u l a t i o n , is a q u e s t i o n to be tested in
future broad areal surveys.
The c o n t r a d i c t i o n s between the site data from S e m i n o l e
Canyon and r e g i o n a l m o d e l s of p r e h i s t o r i c a d a p t a t i o n bear

CULTURAL CONTINUITY AND STABILITY

Two r a t i o n a l e s are most often presented to account for
the c u l t u r a l conservatism w h i c h purportedly p r e v a i l e d throughout the l o n g span of the A r c h a i c stage, v i r t u a l l y u n t i l the
time of E u r o p e a n contact in the Lower Pecos: 1) i s o l a t i o n
from e x t e r n a l c u l t u r a l i n f l u e n c e s (Johnson 1967: 79-81) and
2) e n v i r o n m e n t a l response - either p o s i t i v e l y t h r o u g h the
d e v e l o p m e n t of an a d a p t i v e technology (Shafer 1981) or
c o n v e r s e l y t h r o u g h l i m i t a t i o n s i m p o s e d by an i m p o v e r i s h e d
n a t u r a l h a b i t a t (Kelley 1959; J o h n s o n 1967: 73-74). The
l a t t e r is strongly based in a n a l o g i e s to e t h n o g r a p h i c a l ly
or a r c h e o l o g i c a l l y documented c u l t u r e s w h i c h operated in

or e n v i r o n m e n t but rather to q u e s t i o n the u t i l i t y of the
concept of s t a b i l i t y (Jennings 1957: 284) when the data
now suggest that neither factor was a constant throughout
prehi story.
I s o l a t i o n , or the Q u a r a n t i n e d C u l t u r e
The Lower Pecos Archaic stage is t r a d i t i o n a l l y viewed as
an i n d i g e n o u s d e v e l o p m e n t , r e l a t i v e l y free of external i n f l u ences, because of the l a c k of p a r t i c i p a t i o n in major trade
or diffusion networks, and to the paucity of attractive resources (Johnson 1967: 73-81). Thus, no i m p e t u s for c u l t u r a l
change was d e r i v e d from exposure to a l t e r n a t i v e t e c h n o l o g i e s ,
and alterations in the material culture would result from the
slow process of a d a p t a t i o n rather than i n f u s i o n from i n t r u s i v e
groups or d i f f u s i o n from adjacent c u l t u r e s . I s o l a t i o n c a n n o t
be attributed to physical restrictions; no natural barriers
exist to deter contact.
At present, no e v i d e n c e contradicts the first a s s u m p t i o n ,
that distance from major trade or diffusion routes resulted
in l i t t l e or no exchange of exotic goods w i t h the more complex c u l t u r e s far to the south and to the east (Kelley 1952;
Johnson 1967). However, projectile points characteristic of
the Early and Late Archaic periods are generally s i m i l a r to
those found t h r o u g h o u t central Texas; only in the M i d d l e
A r c h a i c did r e g i o n a l i z a t i o n of the artifact styles p r e v a i l .
The changes in projectile point morphology w h i c h are used to
differentiate t h e s u b d i v i s i o n s w i t h i n t h e A r c h a i c Period c a n
be reviewed in the context of their s p a t i a l d i s t r i b u t i o n .
A l t h o u g h it is true that a morphological change can result
from a factor as s i m p l e as a c h a n g e in h a f t i n g , in the case
of the d e f i n i t i o n of the Early and Late A r c h a i c , e n v i r o n m e n t a l
and subsistence data suggest shifts, not only in point styles,
but also in procurement strategies. The emergence of the
r e g i o n a l l y - s p e c i f i c projectile p o i n t s , s u c h as Panda£e dart
points, the demarcator of the M i d d l e A r c h a i c , in contrast to

The first i n t r u s i o n , w e l l - d o c u m e n t e d at Bonfire S h e l t e r ,
is b e l i e v e d to h a v e o r i g i n a t e d in the P l a i n s or central Texas
and to have coincided with the extension of the bison range
into the Lower Pecos ( D i b b l e 1965; D i b b l e and Lorrain 1968;
D i l l e h a y 1974: 183) d u r i n g a m e s i c i n t e r l u d e about 2500 years
ago (Bryant 1969; Patton and D i b b l e 1982). This discrete time
i n t e r v a l marks the i n c e p t i o n of the Late A r c h a i c Period and is
identified by dart points styles such as Monte.ll, Ca.AttioV'iZ.le.,
and Ma.tiAka.lt. In this case, the intrusion was apparently
prompted by a s i g n i f i c a n t increase in the Lower Pecos natural
resource base and represents a change in subsistence strategy.
A second i n t r u s i o n , the appearance of the fully d e v e l o p e d
Red Monochrome rock art style, can only be r o u g h l y attributed
to the Late Prehistoric Period. It has been hypothesized that
this style had o r i g i n s in the Western P l a i n s (Kirkland and
Newcomb 1967: 84; Gebhard 1965: 36) and may have resulted from
large-scale c l i m a t i c fluctuations in adjacent regions. At
present, however, the reason for the i n g r e s s of the Red Monochrome artists is unknown. No change in the faunal resources,
such as that seen at Bonfire Shelter in e a r l i e r times, is
suggested in the art; only game a n i m a l s a r c h e o l o g i c a l 1 y or
presently known in the region are i l l u s t r a t e d in this style,
and no changes i n m a t e r i a l c u l t u r e can be securely correlated
w i t h the p i c t o g r a p h s . An association w h i c h merits i n t e n s i v e
study is between the introduction of this rock art style and
the sites, such as 41VV448, w h i c h bear only purely Late Prehsitoric artifacts.
The last i n t r u s i o n , best defined at Infierno Camp, is
c l e a r l y d i s t i n g u i s h e d by u n i q u e artifacts and features w h i c h
also suggest a northern o r i g i n in the Plains (Dibble 1978a).
The r a d i c a l differences between the m a t e r i a l r e m a i n s attrib u t a b l e to t h i s c u l t u r e and those of the t r a d i t i o n a l l y d e f i n e d
Archaic stage of the Lower Pecos are so great that a phased e s i g n a t i o n w i t h i n the Late P r e h i s t o r i c Period is proposed.
The reason for the Infierno o c c u p a t i o n r e m a i n s as yet undetermined but, by this late date, it may well be that migration
from a d v e r s i t y was more of an i m p e l l i n g force than any attraction
to the Lower Pecos resource base. However, the presence of
b i s o n in the region in proto-historic times is e t h n o g r a p h i c a l l y
documented (Griffen 1969: 93-94) and t h i s resource may have
drawn hunters to the Lower Pecos from the P l a i n s . Only a more
secure d a t i n g of the Infierno Phase w i l l p e r m i t d e t e r m i n a t i o n
of the factors w h i c h i n f l u e n c e d its i n t r o d u c t i o n to the r e g i o n .
Of paramount importance to the question of cultural
s t a b i l i t y is the source of the data w h i c h suggests or demonstrates that i s o l a t i o n d i d not p r e v a i l t h r o u g h o u t the d u r a t i o n
of the Lower Pecos A r c h a i c stage. E v i d e n c e for the l a s t two
was c o n t a i n e d in u p l a n d , exposed sites or in rock art w h i c h
can not be related to any occupational debris. Only the first,
the i n g r e s s of the b i s o n hunters from a P l a i n s - t y p e h a b i t a t ,
is e v i d e n c e d in s h e l t e r d e p o s i t s , and then only at B o n f i r e

g i n s of the Southern P l a i n s . A d d i t i o n a l l y , each of the three
i n t r u s i o n s is c l e a r l y demonstrated at o n l y one or two sites
in the entire region. Were not Bonfi re Shelter, Infierno Camp,
and the two large Red Monochrome p a n e l s known, the sole e v i dence for the presence of foreign groups w o u l d lie in scattered
upland sites or as minor components in rock shelter deposits.
Efforts to d e l i n e a t e e v i d e n c e for c h a n g e in rock shelter
deposits h a v e proved so ineffectual that the latest projects
have sought to find the reasons for s t a b i l i t y . G i v e n the
extensive areas of the Lower Pecos w h i c h r e m a i n an a r c h e o l o g ical v o i d , to g e n e r a l i z e from s t a b i l i t y in m i d d e n deposits
to s t a b i l i t y of the entire c u l t u r a l system is to ignore the
numerous a l t e r n a t i v e s for h a b i t a t i o n and e x p l o i t a t i o n . It
may well be, as is the case in the Late Prehistoric Period,
that adequate data are not d i s c e r n i b l e in m i d d e n deposits
and only broad regional surveys can isolate trends or changes
in patterning t h r o u g h o u t the Archaic Period.
E n v i r o n m e n t a l Response and E t h n o g r a p h i c A n a l o g y
Attempts to e x p l a i n the static nature of the A r c h a i c
a d a p t a t i o n h a v e r e l i e d upon analogy to the Desert C u l t u r e as
defined by J e n n i n g s (1957) for Great B a s i n p r e h i s t o r i c groups
and to the model for C o a h u i l t e c a n groups proposed by Taylor
(1964). Jenning's model presents a primary desert efficiency
s i m i l a r to C a l d w e l l ' s (1958) primary forest efficiency and
Braidwood's (1952) primary v i l l a g e efficiency w h e r e i n adaptation is so finely tuned to the h a b i t a t that homeostasis is
a c h i e v e d . A b a s i c flaw in the a p p l i c a t i o n of these e x p l a n a tory d e v i c e s may be v i e w e d from two p e r s p e c t i v e s - the a p p l i c a b i l i t y of the e n v i r o n m e n t a l e q u a t i o n and the contrasts between essential characteristics of these social systems and
those of the Lower Pecos.
A b a s i c p r e m i s e of J e n n i n g s ' (1957: 284) concept of the
widespread Desert Archaic is "that the Desert Culture w i l l be
found wherever l i f e is h a r d , and full e x p l o i t a t i o n of the e n v i ronment is r e q u i r e d for s u r v i v a l . " A corollary to the m a r g i n a l
existence proposed for the desert d w e l l e r s w i t h w h i c h J e n n i n g s
d e a l t is that "The l a c k of a r t i s t i c d e v e l o p m e n t and of l e i s u r e
time for elaborate games seems to re-inforce an e a r l i e r interpretation that there was l i t t l e l e i s u r e and a r e l a t i v e l y b l e a k
e m o t i o n a l 1 i fe."
A l t h o u g h the e n v i r o n m e n t of the Lower Pecos d u r i n g the
A r c h a i c may not h a v e been what we w o u l d c o n s i d e r l u s h , the
strictures imposed by c o n d i t i o n s as harsh and h o s t i l e as they
are sometimes portrayed w o u l d not a l l o w the fluoresence of the
e l a b o r a t e a n d h i g h l y d e v e l o p e d Pecos R i v e r style p i c t o g r a p h s .
No attempt has been made to q u a n t i f y the l a b o r i n v o l v e d in the
execution of even one of the l a r g e p a n e l s , but it is a p p a r e n t
that s u f f i c i e n t l e i s u r e time or s u r p l u s a l l o w e d s p e c i a l i s t s to

devote c o n s i d e r a b l e effort to aesthetic or r i t u a l expression.
Attempts to r e c o n c i l e the concept of the Desert Culture
w i t h the r i c h aesthetic l i f e of the Lower Pecos d w e l l e r s d u r i n g
the A r c h a i c Period are c o n t i n g e n t upon the accurate placement
of the Pecos R i v e r style rock art in time. If this art form
is as old and as l o n g - l a s t i n g as the m a t e r i a l traits of the
A r c h a i c , s t a b i l i t y is i m p l i e d ; if of briefer d u r a t i o n , s i g n i ficant c h a n g e in the less t a n g i b l e aspects of c u l t u r e and
perhaps a period of economic prosperity are suggested.
Taylor's (1964) thesis is based on extant desert groups
w i t h w i d e l y separated water sources w h i c h mandated a proprietary
social control, or water t e r r i t o r i a l i t y , to insure that nomadic
groups had access to these l i m i t e d s u p p l i e s . A d d i t i o n a l l y , a
b a l a n c e had to be m a i n t a i n e d between two d e t e r m i n a n t s of settlement, the water of the v a l l e y floor and the vegetal resources
of the s l o p e s , or monto.. Thus, Taylor (1964: 199) saw the
system of the modern C o a h u i l t e c a n s as a compromise i n t e n d e d to
r e c o n c i l e the factors of "...the natural c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the
terrain and food s u p p l y , yet t i e d , l i k e a p i c k e t e d horse, to
the l o c u s (or l o c i ) of s o c i a l l y r e c o g n i z e d or s o c i a l l y sanctioned
r i g h t " , a c o n d i t i o n he c a l l e d tethered n o m a d i s m . This concept
was e x t e n d e d from the h i s t o r i c p o p u l a t i o n to the b i o l o g i c a l l y
and c u l t u r a l l y u n r e l a t e d p r e h i s t o r i c p o p u l a t i o n s , and a cont i n u i t y in c u l t u r a l a d a p t a t i o n to e n v i r o n m e n t was p o s t u l a t e d .
If t h i s model is to be a p p l i e d to the Lower Pecos, it
must be recognized that three permanently f l o w i n g r i v e r s
traverse the r e g i o n . T h u s , any tether to water w o u l d not be
bound to s p e c i f i c p l a c e s , but to these major courses w i t h
d e n d r i t i c extensions into the tributary canyons w h i c h often
h e l d f l o w i n g or casual water. Therefore, seasonal rounds were
m u c h more l i k e l y governed by the a v a i l a b i l i t y of resources
other t h a n water. It s h o u l d be remembered, that in the case
of S e m i n o l e Canyon, the entire canyon system is w i t h i n a day's
w a l k of the Rio Grande and some l i m i t e d s u p p l i e s of water were
a v a i l a b l e at i n t e r v a l s a l o n g the way.
T e r r i t o r i a l i t y , in t h e r i g i d sense, w o u l d b e extremely
d i f f i c u l t for s m a l l n o m a d i c bands to enforce a l o n g l o n g stretches
of these r i v e r s . If s o c i a l s a n c t i o n s served to reserve s p e c i f i c
areas for a related g r o u p , both the s a n c t i o n s and the areas are
d i f f i c u l t to detect i n the a r c h e o l o g i c a l sense. The rock art
may h a v e been a s y m b o l i c statement of o w n e r s h i p but how it was
so e m p o w e r e d is beyond a r c h e o l o g i c a l d e f i n i t i o n .
T h u s , the e s s e n t i a l c o n s e r v a t i s m of the c u l t u r a l systems
of the C o a h u i l t e c a n s , seen by Taylor as a product of t h e i r
u n i q u e e n v i r o n m e n t a l s i t u a t i o n , was a r e s u l t of s p e c i f i c
g e o g r a p h i c factors not i n h e r e n t to the Lower Pecos. However,
when p e o p l e l i v e in s y m b i o s i s w i t h t h e i r n a t u r a l h a b i t a t a s
c l o s e l y as was the case i n the Lower Pecos, it is l o g i c a l to
assume t h a t e n v i r o n m e n t was a s i g n i f i c a n t d e t e r m i n i s t i c component in their c u l t u r a l a d a p t a t i o n .

PROBLEMS IN P A L E O E N V I R O N M E N T A L RECONSTRUCTION
In the Lower Pecos, the e m p h a s i s on strictures i m p o s e d
by l i m i t e d n a t u r a l resources has a p p r o a c h e d the l e v e l of
e n v i r o n m e n t a l d e t e r m i n i s m (Kelley 1959; Taylor 1964; J o h n s o n
1964, 1967; Bryant and Shafer 1977). T h u s , it is of primary
i m p o r t a n c e that the c l i m a t i c sequence d e s c r i b e d for the r e g i o n
be refined to accomodate f l u c t u a t i o n s suggested by the arche o l o g i c a l record and to determine the effects of d i f f e r e n t i a l
p r e s e r v a t i o n of d e p o s i t s through time and space.
The effect of c l i m a t i c c h a n g e on b i o t i c c o m m u n i t i e s ,
i n c l u d i n g that of m a n , has been amply demonstrated in North
American prehistory (Bryson, B a e r r e i s and W e n d l a n d 1970;
Bryson and Murray 1975; Bryson 1980; G u n n and Adams 1981).
In the span of Lower Pecos prehistory, three major c u l t u r a l
periods are d e f i n e d on the b a s i s of d i f f e r i n g s u b s i s t e n c e modes
directly a t t r i b u t a b l e to p a l e o e n v i r o n m e n t a l a d a p t a t i o n - the
Late P a l o i n d i a n b i g - g a m e e x p l o i t a t i o n ( D i b b l e 1965; D i b b l e a n d
Lorrain 1968; D i b b l e 1970), the g e n e r a l i z e d A r c h a i c d e p e n d e n c e
on x e r i c flora and fauna (Kelley 1959; J o h n s o n 1964; 1967)
and the Late A r c h a i c mass h u n t i n g strategy ( D i b b l e 1965; D i b b l e
and Lorrain 1968; D i b b l e 1970). In these three i n s t a n c e s ,
the p a l e o e n v i r o n m e n t a l c o n d i t i o n s can be c o n s i d e r e d as a major
c o n t r i b u t i n g factor in d i s j u n c t i o n s in the c u l t u r a l trajectory.
Most attempts to reconstruct past h a b i t a t s in the Lower
Pecos have depended upon a r c h e o l o g i c a l 1 y d e r i v e d data. Time
controls e s t a b l i s h e d for trends seen in p o l l e n and faunal
analyses and paleoflood frequencies rely upon radiocarbon
assays o r i g i n a l l y obtained to date cultural deposits (e.g.,
Bryant 1969; Bryant and Shafer 1977; Patton and D i b b l e 1982).
The c l i m a t i c sequence thus derived can then be most easily
viewed in its r e l a t i o n s h i p to human occupation of the region.
R e c a p i t u l a t e d , the proposed view of the environmental
sequence since the Late Pleistocene is as follows (Bryant
1977: 15-16). Late f u l l - g l a c i a l pinyon pine woodlands
were replaced by l a t e - g l a c i a l parklands ca. 10,000 to 7,000
years ago. These grasslands supported l a r g e herbivores,
and their attendant hunters, the Late P a l e o i n d i a n people.
A widespread erosional period is postulated between 7000 and
4000 B.P. on the basis of unconformities seen in the stratig r a p h i c profiles at Arenosa Shelter and the D e v i l ' s Mouth
Site, l e a d i n g Bryant (1977: 17) to favor Haynes' (1968: 610612) interpretation of a hot and dry A l t i t h e r m a l between 7500
and 6000 B.P. followed by more mesic conditions from 6000 to
3000 B.P. A generalized trend toward aridity continued until
today, broken only by a mesic i n t e r l u d e about 2500 years ago
s i g n a l l e d by the expansion of the b i s o n p o p u l a t i o n s into the
region. Since that time, no disjunction in the drying trend
has been detected in the environmental e v i d e n c e (Bryant 1969;
Bryant and Shafer 1977; Shafer and others 1975; Shafer and
Bryant 1977).

erosional e p i s o d e s d o c u m e n t e d at that site suggest that differential p r e s e r v a t i o n of d e p o s i t s may h a v e so b i a s e d the
representation of P a l e o i n d i a n and Early A r c h a i c o c c u p a t i o n s
in the Lower Pecos that any settlement pattern or p o p u l a t i o n
density estimates for those periods are rendered suspect.
S i m i l a r l y , increased p o p u l a t i o n can not be a s s u m e d solely from
h i g h e r observed site frequencies in later p e r i o d s . The hypothesized trend towards e x p a n s i o n of the resource base d u r i n g
the M i d d l e and Late A r c h a i c s h o u l d be e x a m i n e d in the context
of e n v i r o n m e n t a l data; a t t r i b u t i n g it to p o p u l a t i o n pressure
is non-explanatory (Cowgill 1975) since h u n t i n g and g a t h e r i n g
groups u s u a l l y m a i n t a i n a p o p u l a t i o n e q u i l i b r i u m c o n s i d e r a b l y
beneath the carrying capacity of their h a b i t a t ( B i r d s e l l 1968)
If p o p u l a t i o n d i d i n c r e a s e , an increase in resources, e i t h e r
e n v i r o n m e n t a l l y or t e c h n o l o g i c a l l y produced, is s u g g e s t e d .
The effects of the erosional events demonstrated at
B l a c k Cave are not restricted to the i n a n i m a t e record of
c u l t u r e . The p o p u l a t i o n s that were forced to a d a p t to these
c h a n g i n g natural c o n d i t i o n s p r o b a b l y selected c u l t u r a l m e a n s
of s u r v i v a l . It w o u l d not be s u r p r i s i n g if those changes
are interpreted today as the t r a n s i t i o n from P a l e o i n d i a n to
Early Archaic s u b s i s t e n c e modes and, later in time, as the
r e g i o n a l i z a t i o n of projectile p o i n t styles w h i c h mark the
Middle Archaic.
The r e g i o n a l extent of the c u t - a n d - f i l l sequences seen
at B l a c k Cave is suggested by the c o r r e l a t i o n of the e a r l i e s t
unconformity (pre-6800 B.P.) with s i m i l a r e v i d e n c e throughout
the a l l u v i a l sequences of the Greater Southwest (Haynes 1968:
Table 1) and w i t h p h y s i c a l l y s i m i l a r traces in other l o w - l y i n g
s h e l t e r s and canyons in the area. T h i s q u e s t i o n is c e r t a i n l y
a topic for primary concern in future environmental studies.
Many of the d i s c r e p a n c i e s between w h a t is known of the
c l i m a t i c sequence and the e v i d e n c e for c u l t u r a l c h a n g e is a
function of the s a m p l e bias toward long-term occupational
sites w i t h A r c h a i c d e p o s i t s . The concentration of e x c a v a t i o n s
i n t h e d e e p l y s t r a t i f i e d shelters m a k e s d i s t i n g u i s h i n g t h e
cultural static from the natural evidence d i f f i c u l t . In
a d d i t i o n , the l a c k of i n t e g r a t i o n w i t h the g r o w i n g body of
i n f o r m a t i o n from adjacent areas, such as central and southern
Texas, the Greater Southwest, and the Great P l a i n s , has res u l t e d in a narrowed perception of the effects of e n v i r o n m e n t
upon c u l t u r e . Often it is the case that short-term f l u c t u a tions are more apparent on the margins, in the transitional
zones such as the Lower Pecos. More d r a s t i c c l i m a t i c deteri o r a t i o n , s u c h as the e x t e n s i v e d r o u g h t s ca. A.D. 1200 on
the P l a i n s (Bryson and Murray 1975; Bryson 1980) and in the
Southwest, may h a v e had r e p e r c u s s i o n s in the Lower Pecos,

Three basic concerns are reflected in the recommendations
for the c o n s e r v a t i o n or more i n t e n s i v e study of the e n t i r e
spectrum o f sites w i t h i n t h e Park. F i r s t , i n d i v i d u a l sites
w h i c h h a v e the p o t e n t i a l to c o n t r i b u t e to the u n d e r s t a n d i n g
of the history or prehistory of the area are s i n g l e d out.
These sites are recommended for further work s o l e l y upon
the b a s i s of t h e i r s c i e n t i f i c v a l u e , e i t h e r as d e t e r m i n e d by
t h i s survey or by previous i n v e s t i g a t i o n . Secondly, the
question of the i m p a c t of p u b l i c access is addressed. Areas
of the Park are rated a c c o r d i n g to the degree of i m m e d i a t e
impact under the current state of park d e v e l o p m e n t and s p e c i f i c
recommendations for ameliorating these effects are offered.
F i n a l l y , a s u g g e s t i o n for future park d e v e l o p m e n t w h i c h
m i g h t o b v i a t e the need for extreme p r o t e c t i v e measures" is

Despite the apparent contradiction of recommending dis

C a i r n Sites
The d i s m a n t l e m e n t of C a i r n A, 41VV364, served to tentat i v e l y confirm the b u r i a l f u n c t i o n of these features. However,

recovered at the bottom of the c a i r n , the Scaltoin p o i n t may
h a v e been d i s c o u n t e d as i n t r u s i v e , and the c a i r n s dated to the
Archaic Period on the basis of the two untyped dart points.
The p o s s i b i l i t y that the Pe-td-cz s p e c i m e n reached its p o s i t i o n
by some n o n - h u m a n agency is remote, but by the same token t h i s
one fragmentary artifact cannot be c o n s i d e r e d as d e f i n i t i v e .

c o n s e r v a t i o n of e x a m p l e s for future study. D i s m a n t l e m e n t of
c a i r n features at both 41VV364 and 407 is r e c o m m e n d e d .
The p o t e n t i a l of s i m i l a r c o n s t r u c t i o n s at 41VV398 and 374
has been s e r i o u s l y d i m i n i s h e d by the extent of m o d e r n m o d i f i c a t i o n s to the s i t e areas; the d e s i g n a t i o n of 41VV398 as prehistoric is only tentative due to the i n t e n s i v e l a n d use of
t h e area d u r i n g r a i l r o a d a n d s u b s e q u e n t c o n s t r u c t i o n . A d d i t i o n a l l y , the c a i r n s of 41VV404 do not conform to the o r i e n t a t i o n and p o s i t i o n , r e l a t i v e to the canyon, w h i c h seem to
c h a r a c t e r i z e the b u r i a l c a i r n s . The f u n c t i o n of these features
can only be determined by further a n a l y s i s s u c h as careful

work merited at 41VV404 is offered in the f o l l o w i n g s e c t i o n .
The s m a l l r e c t a n g u l a r c a i r n s of 41VV366 and 403 were
p l a c e d in the prehistoric period because of the l i t h i c m a t e r i a l
proximal to the former and because their construction is diss i m i l a r to known historic survey markers (Emory 1857). Howe v e r , t h i s a s s i g n m e n t is o n l y s u g g e s t e d ; l i t h i c m a t e r i a l s u c h
as t h a t at 41VV366 is common on s i m i l a r h i g h rims t h r o u g h o u t
the area and the c o i n c i d e n c e here may be fortuitous. The
s a l i e n t characteristic of both, the situation on h i g h points
w h i c h afford s w e e p i n g v i e w s of the canyons, w o u l d seem to prov i d e the r a t i o n a l e for t h e i r construction but w h e t h e r it was
p r e h i s t o r i c or h i s t o r i c b u i l d e r s who used these v a n t a g e p o i n t s
is yet to be d e t e r m i n e d . The o p e n i n g of one of these features,

Rock She!ters
As is the case t h r o u g h o u t most of the Lower Pecos, the
m i d d e n d e p o s i t s in v i r t u a l l y a l l o f t h e rock s h e l t e r s h a v e
been d i s r u p t e d to the degree that further e x c a v a t i o n w o u l d
seem f r u i t l e s s . However, 41VV408, w h i c h h a d r e m a i n e d h i d d e n
from the a r c h e o l o g i s t s who p r e v i o u s l y surveyed in the a r e a ,
seems to h a v e been s i m i l a r l y m i s s e d by the c o l l e c t o r s .
The rock art of 41VV408 does not r e a d i l y conform to the
e s t a b l i s h e d p h a s e s or types set forth by K i r k l a n d and Newcomb
(1967) or G e b h a r d (1960, 1965). H o w e v e r , c e r t a i n a t t r i b u t e s
are r e m i n i s c e n t of the Red L i n e a r f i g u r e s of both Fate B e l l
S h e l t e r and the Red L i n e a r Site. In the former, a p r o c e s s i o n
of s m a l l red f i g u r e s w i n d s its way across a f a u l t l i n e , l o o k i n g
for a l l the world l i k e a North American hunter-gatherer version

of the s h e l t e r w a l l , across a f a u l t l i n e , to the a d j a c e n t face
( F i g . 20).
As at Red L i n e a r , the f i g u r e s are i t h y p h a l l i c and
p o s s i b l y a c c o m p a n i e d by d o g s . At all three s i t e s , the f i g u r e s

are in p r o f i l e , a rarity among the frontal 1y-posed static Pecos
R i v e r Style p a n e l s . Perhaps t h i s c o n v e n t i o n served to emphasize the o b v i o u s m a s c u l i n i t y so p r o m i n e n t l y d i s p l a y e d . The
s i m i l a r i t y of the art of 41VV408 to the Red Linear Style is
only t h e m a t i c . The fine l i n e s and graceful a n i m a t i o n that so
v i v i d l y convey the i m p r e s s i o n of m o b i l i t y in the p a n e l s at
the Red Linear Site and Fate B e l l Shelter are sadly l a c k i n g .
N e v e r t h e l e s s , at present, t h i s is the closest a f f i n i t y to any
known style of the Lower Pecos.
The deposits at 41VV408 are not v i s i b l y disturbed by
v a n d a l s and the quantity of complete stone tools exposed on
the surface seems to confirm the i s o l a t i o n of the site.
Natural forces, such as slopewash and a n i m a l b u r r o w i n g , h a v e
caused m i n o r d i s p l a c e m e n t and the c h a n n e l i n g effect of the
s l o p i n g floor results in d a m p e n i n g of the d e p o s i t s , thus preservation of n o n - l i t h i c items cannot be expected.
Four
c o m p l e t e projectile points were recovered from the surface of
the shelter directly beneath the c l e a r e s t of the r e m a i n i n g
rock art figures. The three p o i n t s w h i c h c o u l d be a s s i g n e d
to a definite type, two Langtx.y and one l/a£ 1/eAde. dart points,
i n d i c a t e an o c c u p a t i o n between 2800 and 4100 years ago. A l t h o u g h the c u l t u r a l deposit in 41VV408 is c o n s i d e r a b l e , the
massive depth characteristic of the long-term use shelters
such as Fate B e l l and 41VV75 are not present, s u g g e s t i n g perhaps a d i s c r e t e i n t e r v a l of o c c u p a t i o n d u r i n g the M i d d l e
A r c h a i c Period. If e x c a v a t i o n s served to confirm t h i s poss i b i l i t y , an i n f e r e n t i a l date for the execution of the rock
art c o u l d be presupposed. A d m i t t e d l y tenuous, this a p p r o a c h
seems to present the sole method of g a i n i n g even an a p p r o x i mation of the age of the style. Further development of
d a t i n g t e c h n i q u e s f o r m i n u t e s a m p l e s is o b v i o u s l y preferable
but its v i a b i l i t y for rock art p i g m e n t s or b i n d e r s has yet
to be demonstrated.
41VV408 is w i t h i n the p u b l i c segment of the Park but
access from state-owned l a n d is d i f f i c u l t w i t h o u t s p e c i a l
e q u i p m e n t . However, h a l f of the s i t e , the upper u n o c c u p i e d
part, is on p r i v a t e l a n d and more a c c e s s i b l e from that d i r e c t i o n
It is a l s o p o s s i b l e , but d i f f i c u l t , d e p e n d i n g upon reservoir

Park l a n d s for the most part. Electronic m o n i t o r i n g of this
site is j u s t i f i e d by its i s o l a t i o n from other protective

A d d i t i o n a l l y , test e x c a v a t i o n s
are warranted by the u n i q u e , u n d i s t u r b e d nature of the dep o s i t s and by the p o s s i b i l i t y of r e l a t i n g these d e p o s i t s to

upon the u t i l i t y of a d d i t i o n a l probings of the considerable

In 1981, near the close of our second field season, TPWD,

the m o t i v a t i o n for the placement of u n i t s would be influenced

A t h i r d factor to be w e i g h e d is the i n e v i t a b i l i t y of increased dust content in the a i r c a u s e d by e x c a v a t i o n . If the

The east bank of S e m i n o l e Canyon remains closed to the

on a h i g h point d i s t a n t from the canyon rim where access
from the reservoir is p o s s i b l e and where the scenic view is

procedure s u c h as t h i s w o u l d a l s o i n i t i a t e a program of further
study into the u p l a n d sites, a recommendation of many previous
researchers in the Lower Pecos R i v e r R e g i o n (Anderson 1974;

P l a n , (TPWD 1973: 9) that these sites are g e n e r a l l y l i g h t
l i t h i c scatters, has been shown to be premature.
F i n a l l y , it is recommended that the site c o m p l e x e s in any

a r c h e o l o g i c a l site. P e n a l t i e s for v a n d a l i s m or a r t i f a c t c o l l e c t i o n s h o u l d be d e f i n e d as they are on signs w i t h i n the major

c o n t e n t i o n by some a r c h e o l o g i s t s that by d r a w i n g a t t e n t i o n to
these less obvious sites, the i n v i t a t i o n to looting is extended.
G i v e n the k n o w l e d g e of the professional c o l l e c t o r , it is most
p r o b a b l e they w o u l d r e c o g n i z e the l o c a l i t i e s as sites. Prom i n e n t display of the law concerning the a r c h e o l o g i c a l v a l u e

The inventory of the c u r r e n t state of the p i c t o g r a p h s

RATES OF D E T E R I O R A T I O N

Comparison of the 1932 p h o t o g r a p h i c record of Jackson
(n.d., 1938) and that of 1981 i n d i c a t e s v a r i a b l e rates of
deterioration correlate well w i t h the degree of exposure to
d e s t r u c t i v e factors. Protected figures, internal to the
shelters, have often changed l i t t l e over the past five
decades (see Figs. 3, 16). M u c h more recent p i c t o g r a p h s at
Vaquero Shelter are in the process of d i s a p p e a r i n g due to
exposure (Fig. 15). Thus, r e l a t i v e c o n d i t i o n is no key to
the age of the p a i n t i n g s u n l e s s a l l other factors are e q u a l .
In terms of i m m e d i a c y , efforts to conserve remnant art are most
i m p e r a t i v e at the open sites.
The oft-expressed sentiment of l o c a l residents that
deterioration has accelerated in l i v i n g memory may be attrib u t a b l e to the d e v a s t a t i n g effects of the catastrophic floods
of 1954 and 1974, to v a n d a l i s m promoted by increased access
v i a Amistad Reservoir, and to the ashy dust layers d e p o s i t e d
on the w a l l s by both s c i e n t i f i c and u n c o n t r o l l e d e x c a v a t i o n s
of the s h e l t e r deposits. The role of other suggested hazards,
such as the increased h u m i d i t y caused by the i m p o u n d m e n t of
A m i s t a d Reservoir or the increase in acid r a i n due to modern
t e c h n o l o g y , can not be readily assessed because no record of
prior l e v e l s or e v a l u a t i o n s of their p r o b a b l e impact exist.
However, the absorption of p o l l u t a n t s from the atmosphere is
not as h i g h in rural environments nor in s e m i - a r i d regions
w i t h i n f r e q u e n t , heavy r a i n f a l l as it is in urban areas or
those w i t h more uniform p r e c i p i t a t i o n ( W i n k l e r 1975: 95-98).
It is now apparent, however, that only a fraction of the
rock art sites w h i c h once existed are recorded today, and that
the most f r a g i l e p i c t o g r a p h s h a v e deteriorated to o b l i v i o n . The
S e m i n o l e Canyon area was one of the most t h o r o u g h l y s t u d i e d
in the Lower Pecos region yet the inventory of pictographs was
i n c o m p l e t e . L i t e r a l l y scores more m u s t a w a i t r e c o r d i n g and
these w i l l most p r o b a b l y be s m a l l , s e c l u d e d shelters overlooked in the quest for m o n u m e n t a l art.

it would be a threat to be reckoned w i t h , as is w e l l - i l l u s t r a t e d
i n a c c e s s i b l e sites a l o n g Lake A m i s t a d . V a n d a l i s m w i t h i n t h e
Park is c o n s i d e r a b l y reduced by the c e r t a i n k n o w l e d g e that
p e n a l t i e s can be a p p l i e d ; no such i n h i b i t i o n operates outside
its c o n f i n e s . The sites a c c e s s i b l e from the R e s e r v o i r are
c o n s i d e r e d most s e r i o u s l y in d a n g e r of future defacement.
As is stated in the preceding section on the impact of
access to the a r c h e o l o g i c a l sites as a w h o l e , the s i t e s on
S e m i n o l e Canyon w h i c h are a c c e s s i b l e by boat or from the nature

these, 41VV230 is u n d e r water, Panther C a v e is fenced, and
41VV335 i s v a n d a l i z e d a l m o s t beyond recovery. H o w e v e r , 4 1 V V 408 is as yet u n d i s t u r b e d and s h o u l d be protected. As the

The o v e r r i d i n g need in the Park is to make reparations

so poorly preserved that the o n l y a l t e r n a t i v e at p r e s e n t may
be r e c o n s t r u c t i o n .
The m o d e r n i t y of the g r a f f i t i at Fate B e l l S h e l t e r is
e v i d e n t in the o b s c e n i t i e s and the use of i r i d e s c e n t spray
p a i n t . D u r i n g the early assessments prior to the c o n s t r u c t i o n
of A m i s t a d R e s e r v o i r , the surveyors marked each a r c h e o l o g i c a l
site with a green p a i n t e d t r i n o m i a l p l a c e d in an area genera l l y d e v o i d of rock art ( F i g . 9b). At that t i m e , t h i s was a
safeguard i n d i c a t i n g t h a t the site had been recorded.
Given
the rugged t e r r a i n , poor m a p s , and i n a c c e s s i b i l i t y of many of
the sites, this m a r k i n g functioned to identify the sites w h e n
r e l o c a t e d . F o r t u n a t e l y , in Fate B e l l S h e l t e r , humanSj as
i m i t a t i v e creatures, a d d e d m u c h o f their more b l a t a n t g r a f f i t i
to the barren areas m a r k e d by the surveyors.
In N o v e m b e r , 1981, the first e x p e r i m e n t s in r e m o v a l were
carried out by TPWD staff m e m b e r s and conservators from the
Texas M e m o r i a l M u s e u m ( R a l p h 1981). Four L i q u i t e x waterbased a c r y l i c tube p a i n t s and four dry p i g m e n t s m i x e d w i t h
a c r y l i c m e d i u m (ivory w h i t e , t i t a n i u m b l a c k , r a w s i e n n a a n d
raw umber) were b l e n d e d to m a t c h the l i m e s t o n e c o l o r a t i o n .
Three coats were a p p l i e d w i t h a r t i s t s b r u s h e s or wadded p a p e r
b l o t t e r s . These p a i n t s were c h o s e n for s t a b i l i t y and r e v e r s i b i l i t y ; a l l c a n b e removed w i t h a l c o h o l o r acetone.
Attempts to strip the green o i l - b a s e d paint u s i n g acetone, water, g l a s s fiber and steel wire brushes were uns u c c e s s f u l . Red crayon graffiti proved w a t e r - s o l u b l e so it
was scored w i t h a wet g l a s s fiber brush and b l o t t e d to t h i n
and remove the c o l o r . Some s p r e a d i n g of a t h i n , p i n k f i l m
resulted.
At present, the re i n t e g r a t i o n of the graffiti is potentially the least harmful approach. Additional coatings
may be needed because of the p h e n o m e n o n noted by the Park
staff d u r i n g a period of heavy fog; the graffiti became v i s i b l e
t h r o u g h the a c r y l i c o v e r c o a t i n g for the d u r a t i o n of the h i g h
h u m i d i t y . These procedures seem most a p p l i c a b l e at 41VV72
where m u c h of the a u t o g r a p h y was etched u s i n g a m i l d c a u s t i c
substance w h i c h bleached the lettering onto the darker surface
of the s h e l t e r .
Biological

Growths

Four forms of b i o l o g i c a l growth are d e t r i m e n t a l to the
rock art to v a r y i n g d e g r e e s . In many of the s h e l t e r s , s m a l l

Although
no specific tests for the presence of v a r i o u s k i n d s of

bacteria (those w h i c h take their energy from s u n l i g h t ,
c h e m i c a l o x i d a t i o n and reduction rather than from organic
substances in the s o i l ) are c h e m i c a l l y d e g r a d i n g the n a t i v e

The c o m p l e x processes by w h i c h stone n a t u r a l l y decays
are d i s c u s s e d in d e t a i l by W i n k i e r (1975). Factors w h i c h

in S e m i n o l e Canyon are summarized in h i g h l y s i m p l i f i e d terms
to a c q u a i n t the reader w i t h some of the processes w h i c h contribute to the e x f o l i a t i o n ( f l a k i n g or s p a l l i n g ) of the l i m e s t o n e .
The c o m p l e x interaction of m o i s t u r e and s a l t s are the
most d a m a g i n g factor in stone decay ( W i n k l e r 1975: 102).

Water p e r c o l a t i n g or p a s s i n g t h r o u g h s m a l l c a p i l l a r i e s

a p p r o a c h e s e q u i l i b r i u m w i t h the s a l t content of the rock. Solu b l e salts tend to m i g r a t e toward the surface of the rock where
e v a p o r a t i o n from the c a p i l l a r y pores forces c r y s t a l l i z a t i o n .
The h i g h e s t c o n c e n t r a t i o n is thus always near the surface,
d i m i n i s h i n g rapidly with interior distance. The efflorescing
of these d i s s o l v e d salts r e s u l t s in the m i n e r a l a c c r e t i o n s

in t u r n , absorb m o i s t u r e even u n d e r c o n d i t i o n s o f r e l a t i v e l y

the o r g i a s t i c group at the Red L i n e a r site (Fig. 18).
The thermal e x p a n s i o n of trapped salts and m o i s t u r e is
accentuated by the temperature extremes c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of
a r i d or semi-arid regions. Just as the concentration of salts
is near the end of the c a p i l l a r i e s , the temperatures are most
extreme at the rock surface. Both heat e v a p o r a t i o n and frost
a c t i o n cause v o l u m e t r i c changes and exert h y d r a u l i c pressure.

rock. T h i s surface i n d u r a t i o n can be q u i t e p r o t e c t i v e if,
as is often the case in the Lower Pecos, it is composed of
c a l c i t e or c a l c i u m s u l f i t e . The e n t r a p p e d salts weaken the

Four forms of limestone e x f o l i a t i o n are apparent to

a) Granular deterioration is prevalent at 41VV 8 4 (Fig.

In these s i t e s , the c a l c i t e in
the highly fossiliferous limestone dissolves, l e a v i n g the

41VV84, 377 and 410 is to be found at the end of the w a l l s

chief contribution l i e s in the increase in the frequency of
sites known to h a v e once h e l d rock art. The common d e n o m i nator in these sites is t h e i r l o c a t i o n a l o n g the same b e d d i n g

of the limestone beds. Thus, the l i t h o l o g y of the parent rock
p r o b a b l y controls the s p a l l i n g process at these sites.

is c o m p l e t e l y exposed a b o v e the normal l e v e l of stream flow,
41VV145 is obscured by dense v e g e t a t i o n on the channel floor.
Some evidence for scalar s p a l l i n g was seen at 41VV212, also
on the r i g h t bank of Presa Canyon, but the effects of f l o o d i n g

in the retardation or reattachment of scalar s p a l l s (Silver

that a stratigraphy in s u p e r i m p o s e d p a n e l s can be d e f i n e d .

of l a c u n a e in the p i c t o g r a p h s .
Rock Art D a t i n g
One of the most serious p r o b l e m s in r e l a t i n g the rock
art to its c u l t u r a l context is the present i n a b i l i t y , to a s s i g n
the various styles to a specific period in time. A l t h o u g h the

The d a t i n g of the rock art remains one of the most p e r t i n e n t
tasks and s h o u l d rank as a foremost objective of further

Two a p p r o a c h e s to the a n t h r o p o l o g i c a l study of the
Lower Pecos rock art are suggested by the data garnered by
t h i s study. The f i r s t is at the l e v e l of the i n d i v i d u a l
a r t i s t and is f e a s i b l e w i t h i n a l i m i t e d area such as the Park
and its i m m e d i a t e v i c i n i t y . The second is of b r o a d e r scope
and focuses on l a r g e r t e r r i t o r i a l ranges as reflected by
thematic continuity.

P a r a l l e l s noted in our l e s s - t h a n - r i g o r o u s a t t e n t i o n to
t h i s p o s s i b i l i t y l i n k Panther Cave to 41VV335, a l o g i c a l
p a i r i n g c o n s i d e r i n g their p r o x i m i t y (Fig. 1). One of the
s o l e r e m a i n i n g p i c t o g r a p h s in 41VV335 is a panther o u t l i n e d
with red dashes, possibly signifying hair, very l i k e a
panther and b e a r - l i k e a n i m a l found a m i d s t a profusion of
o v e r p a i n t i n g in Panther Cave. The execution of a l o n g
s i n u o u s l i n e j o i n i n g several short p a r a l l e l , p e r p e n d i c u l a r
l i n e s at Panther is a l s o found at 41 Ml 45 in Presa Canyon.
In turn, 41VV145 and B l a c k Cave share the c o n v e n t i o n of
streamers composed of numerous short interior horizontal
wavy l i n e s . The most d i s t i n c t i v e style in the Park w i t h i n
the range of the Pecos R i v e r ' a r t is to be found at B l a c k
C a v e on the exterior p a n e l s . Here the French i m p r e s s i o n i s t
school found early e x p r e s s i o n in figures composed l a r g e l y
of dots of color of a l i q u i f i e d o a i n t a p p l i e d w i t h a brush.
Destroyed as 41VV75 is today, one l a r g e remnant figure
is strikingly l i k e those on the c e i l i n g of its sister site,
41VV74, Fate B e l l Shelter. A s m a l l figure w i t h r a d i a n t
hair (cover i l l u s t r a t i o n ) , o v e r l o o k e d by K i r k l a n d at P a n t h e r
Cave, has a twin u p - r i v e r at Parida Cave and a third is i l l u s trated at Lookout S h e l t e r (Kirkland and Newcpmb 1967: Plate 22)
F i n a l l y , a s t r i k i n g l i k e n e s s between the h e a d d r e s s e d
l e a d e r in the Red L i n e a r site and he of Fate B e l l S h e l t e r
(Figs. 5b-c), is a p p a r e n t . Other s i m i l a r i t i e s between the
two s i t e s are the l o o p e d - l i n e g e o m e t r i e s w h i c h may be an
i d e o g r a m for huts or a v i l l a g e of h u t s , and the i m p l i c a t i o n s
for s o c i a l s t r a t i f i c a t i o n m a n i f e s t e d in the l a r g e r size of
l e a d i n g figures and in their costumes. A d m i t t e d l y , the
s i m p l i c i t y of many of the Red L i n e a r stick figures l e a v e s
m u c h leeway i n i m i t a t i v e l i c e n s e b u t other p a r a l l e l s between
the c o m p o s i t i o n s as a w h o l e may reflect the i d i o s y n c r a t i c
style of one artist. For e x a m p l e , the s i n u o u s S - s h a p e d
m e m b e r s of the o r g i a s t i c g r o u p s at the Red L i n e a r site are
d u p l i c a t e d by one s m a l l f i g u r e h i g h on the w a l l at Fate B e l l .
At present, t h i s m a n n e r of c o n v e y i n g m o t i o n has been i d e n t i fied at only these two l o c a t i o n s .
The proposition that the path of the i n d i v i d u a l in prehistory can be a r c h e o l o g i c a l 1 y traced, the subject of recent
study ( H i l l and G u n n 1977), seems most p l a u s i b l e i n the context of such a p e r s o n a l e x p r e s s i o n as art even w i t h i n the
d i c t a t e s of r i t u a l c i r c u m s c r i p t i o n . At t h i s l e v e l of a n a l y s i s ,
i n d i v i d u a l figures would be the comparative classes and
s t y l i s t i c s i m i l a r i t i e s the criteria to be tested by p i g m e n t
and b i n d e r a n a l y s e s when a m e t h o d to do so is perfected.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The A r t i s t as a M e m b e r of a S o c i a l G r o u p
Thematic continuity is a tool for the d e f i n i t i o n of
spheres of i n f l u e n c e based on p h i l o s o p h i c a l or social coh e s i o n . M u c h in the same way as c u l t u r a l areas h a v e been
s t a t i s t i c a l l y defined by artistic types and other m a t e r i a l
r e m a i n s , the u n i f i e d themes i n p r e l i t e r a t e art can be q u a n titatively derived (Paul and Turpin 1978). It has been
proposed that the extent of the Pecos R i v e r Style art as a
w h o l e reflects the e x p l o i t a t i o n range of a l i n g u i s t i c a l l y
or s o c i a l l y related g r o u p (Shafer 1977) rather than the
g e o l o g i c constraints of s u i t a b l e surfaces for rock art. The
known extent of Pecos R i v e r art, however, closely a p p r o x i mates the exposures of Georgetown l i m e s t o n e w h i c h were
a p p a r e n t l y favored by the p r e h i s t o r i c artists.
W i t h i n the larger body of the style as a whole, e m p h a s i s
on v a r i o u s motifs may serve to i d e n t i f y s u b g r o u p s and t h e i r
range. For e x a m p l e , the p a n t h e r s and horned s h a m a n of
Panther Cave are so c o h e r e n t l y drawn and so f a i t h f u l l y reproduced at a site on the Pecos R i v e r ( K i r k l a n d and Newcomb
1967: Plate 33) that an u n d e r l y i n g s o c i a l concept, myth, or
totem is s u g g e s t e d . The d i s t r i b u t i o n of such a r t i s t i c themes
may d e f i n e the extent of the s o c i a l g r o u p w h i c h h e l d it in
commo n.
G i v e n the o v e r w h e l m i n g q u a n t i t y of recorded rock art,
and the even greater a m o u n t as yet u n d o c u m e n t e d , a q u a n t i t a t i v e study seems most p r a c t i c a l . The c l a s s i c a l art
h i s t o r i c a l a p p r o a c h w o u l d s e e m i n g l y be defeated by the m a s s
of potential v a r i a b l e s easily managed by computer-assisted
a n a l y s e s . S e r i a t i o n of d o m i n a n t themes may a l s o r e v e a l an
i n t e r n a l e v o l u t i o n w h i c h is e q u i v a l e n t to a r e l a t i v e
chronology.
The t h e m a t i c a p p r o a c h is w e l l beyond the scope of the
present study and beyond the j u r i s d i c t i o n of TPND. It is
offered only in the hope that if l a r g e - s c a l e rock art s t u d i e s
are c a r r i e d out in the future, p r o v i s i o n s for t h i s aspect of
the social connotations of rock art w i l l be made.
SUMMARY OF ROCK ART RECOMMENDATIONS

The i n t e n t of t h i s first p h a s e in the study of the rock
art of S e m i n o l e Canyon State H i s t o r i c a l Park was to i d e n t i f y
and i n v e n t o r y the a r c h e o l o g i c a 1 r e s o u r c e s , to assess their
current condition in comparison with previous documentation,
and to i s o l a t e problem areas in a n t i c i p a t i o n of a long-term
c o n s e r v a t i o n program. The f i r s t s t e p , the i n v e n t o r y , is
l a r g e l y c o m p l e t e . Some a l t e r n a t i v e s u g g e s t i o n s a r e p r e s e n t e d
for i m p r o v i n g rock art d o c u m e n t a t i o n in the m i n o r sites where
p h o t o g r a p h i c m e t h o d s were i n a d e q u a t e . A r t i s t i c r e c o r d i n g i s

rates of d e t e r i o r a t i o n p r e v a i l in r e l a t i o n s h i p to the degree
of e x p o s u r e and the c o m p o s i t i o n of the l i m e s t o n e surfaces.
Causal factors are described from the point of view of careful o b s e r v a t i o n . The i n t r i c a c i e s of the processes and the
p o s s i b l e deterrents fall w i t h i n the p r o v i n c e of the trained
conservator.
Areas of a d d i t i o n a l a r c h e o l o g i c a l research w h i c h are
considered h i g h l y relevant i n c l u d e further analysis of the
p i g m e n t s to test for p i c t o g r a p h s i m i l a r i t i e s and s t r a t i g r a p h y ,
a p p r o a c h e s to rock art d a t i n g , and a n t h r o p o l o g i c a l studies
of p i c t o g r a p h styles.
Rock art c o n s e r v a t i o n is a f i e l d in its infancy and m u c h
of our i n q u i r y into experimental techniques met with frust r a t i o n . Few efforts h a v e succeeded or been tried in
a n a l o g o u s e n v i r o n m e n t s . Only a l o n g - t e r m c o n s e r v a t i o n effort
w h i c h considers the s p e c i f i c factors o p e r a t i v e in the Lower
Pecos w i l l find some s o l u t i o n to the p r o b l e m s of the v a n i s h i n g
rock art. The concern of TPWD has been expressed in their
i n i t i a l attempts to address factors of v a n d a l i s m and the
harmful effects of m i d d e n dust on the p i c t o g r a p h s , and their
s u p p o r t of t h i s b a s e l i n e study. The i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of the
second p h a s e of i n q u i r y is d e p e n d e n t upon the expertise of
t r a i n e d conservators. Using S e m i n o l e Canyon as a laboratory,
progress toward s o l u t i o n of some of the many i l l s w h i c h
p l a g u e the rock art can serve as a model for the entire
Lower Pecos.

GEOMORPHOLOGV

c h a n n e l s (Kochel 1980; Kochel and Baker 1982). S h a l l o w caves,
often the h a b i t a t s of p r e h i s t o r i c p o p u l a t i o n s , formed in nearly
vertical bedrock w a l l s along the outside of meander bends by
the c o m b i n e d a c t i o n of e x f o l i a t i o n , m e c h a n i c a l w e a t h e r i n g
( e s p e c i a l l y i c e - r e l a t e d erosion c a l l e d cryoclastism (Washburn
1979)), and f l u v i a l erosion. This study of the geomorphol ogy
and Quaternary history of S e m i n o l e Canyon and its major t r i b u t a r i e s and rock s h e l t e r s was conducted to d e f i n e factors
affecting the future preservation of rock art on the shelter
wal1s.
CLIMATE
The Seminole Canyon-Pecos River region presently experiences a harsh, s e m i - a r i d c l i m a t e . R a i n f a l l generally increases
from west to east across the r e g i o n from about 30 to 60 cm/yr.
in Val Verde County (Fig. 1-1). A summary of average monthly
p r e c i p i t a t i o n for selected stations (Table 1-1) in the region
is shown in F i g u r e 1-2. Most of the rainfal 1 occurs in late
spring or early fall in association with frontal squall lines
or v i o l e n t h u r r i c a n e s , or easterly waves. A n n u a l p r e c i p i t a t i o n
falls p r i m a r i l y between April and October w i t h peaks common in
May-June and September-October. Scattered, localized thunderstorms cause most of the severe flash floods common in S e m i n o l e
Canyon.
Average monthly m i n i m u m temperatures u s u a l l y occur in
January and February (7-13°C); m o n t h l y m a x i m u m temperatures
occur in July and A u g u s t (27-30°C). E v a p o r a t i o n rates are
four to e i g h t times greater than a n n u a l p r e c i p i t a t i o n and
a r e h i g h e s t between A p r i l a n d September w h e n h i g h temperatures
and powerful southerly winds p r e v a i l .
GEOLOGY
R e g i o n a l G e o l o g i c Structure
The Cretaceous rocks of the S e m i n o l e Canyon area are
r e l a t i v e l y u n d e f o r m e d , a n d d i p o n l y s l i g h t l y toward t h e G u l f
of M e x i c o . In the southeastern part of Val Verde County, the
rocks are part of a broad s y n c l i n e known as the R i o G r a n d e
embayment. East of the S e m i n o l e Canyon area, three major
Paleozoic tectonic features u n d e r l i e the Cretaceous sedimentary rocks; t h e D e v i l s R i v e r U p l i f t , t h e V a l V e r d e B a s i n ,
a n d t h e O u a c h i t a Fold B e l t (Fig. 1-3). T h e D e v i l s R i v e r U p l i f t

Stratigraphy
Four Cretaceous formations are exposed in the S e m i n o l e
Canyon drainage basin (Fig. 1-4). In order, from oldest to
youngest, the formations are: S a l m o n Peak L i m e s t o n e , part of
the Segovia Member of the Edwards Limestone (Ksa); Del Rio
Clay (Kdr); Buda Limestone (Kbu); and B o q u i l l a s Flags (Kbo).
The B o q u i l l a s Formation caps mesas at h i g h e r e l e v a t i o n s just
off the Park (Fig. 1-4). The r e l a t i v e strati graphic positions
of these u n i t s can be seen in a g e n e r a l i z e d g e o l o g i c c o l u m n
in Table 1-2).
The S a l m o n Peak F o r m a t i o n , assumed to be e q u i v a l e n t to
the Segovia Member (Rose 1972) of the Edwards L i m e s t o n e , is
a r u d i s t - b e a r i n g l i m e s t o n e d e p o s i t e d in a s e m i - r e s t r i c t e d
m a r i n e b a s i n d u r i n g the end of the Cretaceous times. It is
l i g h t gray, r e l a t i v e l y pure limestone and d o l o m i t e and is
t y p i c a l l y t h i c k - b e d d e d . The a v e r a g e t h i c k n e s s of the u n i t is
less than 200 meters (Bureau of Economic Geology 1977)
The Del Rio Clay rests u n c o m f o r m a b l y on the S a l m o n Peak
l i m e s t o n e and marks the b e g i n n i n g of U p p e r Cretaceous d e p o sition. This u n i t outcrops in a narrow band throughout the
northern h a l f of S e m i n o l e Canyon State Park and t h i n s westward until it pinches out over the Terrell Arch near the
T e r r e l l - V a l V e r d e County l i n e (Fig. 1-3). Four l i t h o l o g i c
types are recognized in the Del Rio Formation and l i s t e d
in order of d e c r e a s i n g a b u n d a n c e are: l i m e y and s i l t y
claystone, laminated siltstone, coqufna limestone, and
nodular limestone (Freeman 1968). In many areas, the Del
Rio s l o p e s are l i t t e r e d by l a r g e s l u m p b l o c k s of B u d a L i m e stone. The average thickness of the u n i t is less than 25 meters
The Buda L i m e s t o n e forms a f a i r l y resistant c a p r o c k - l i k e

F L U V I A L SYSTEMS IN SOUTHWEST TEXAS

Southwest Texas has one of the most catastrophic r a i n fall and runoff r e g i m e s of any r e g i o n in the U n i t e d States.
A c o m b i n a t i o n of intense local thunderstorms, h i g h d r a i n a g e
densities, h i g h local relief, thin-to-non-existent soil
cover, sparse vegetaton, and steep slopes p r o v i d e a geomorphic setting c o n d u c i v e to flash flooding (Patton and Baker
1976; Kochel and Baker 1982). Streamflow records of the
nearby Pecos and D e v i l s rivers document torrents of water
rampaging through normally dry canyons (International Boundary
and Water Commission 1900-1977; Kochel and Baker 1982). The
morphology of the stream channels appears to be adjusted to
infrequent, h i g h m a g n i t u d e flows. The flood of June 1954 is
a striking example of flood response in this region. It is
l i k e l y that the clean-swept appearance of bedrock canyons in
the lower Pecos region is in large part due to the effects
of this catastrophic flood.
Recent studies of paleoflood hydrology in the lower
Pecos and D e v i l s rivers indicate that the recurrence interval
for the 1954 flood is at least 2,000 years (Kochel and Baker
1982). Comparisons of aerial' photographs from 1954 (preflood) and 1980 document the widespread removal of a l l u v i u m
as the Pecos River and many of its tributaries scoured to
bedrock d u r i n g the 1954 event (Kochel 1980). Readjustment
of channel morphology to the average flow c o n d i t i o n s may
require hundreds of years in semi-arid regions l i k e southwest Texas. In contrast to the d e v a s t a t i n g changes produced
by the 1954 flood, Kochel (1980) showed that the 1974 flood
on the Pecos River (estimated to have been the 500 to 700
year event by Kochel and Baker (1982)) had v i r t u a l l y no
effect on channel morphology. Channel floors had s t i l l not
had time to accumulate a l l u v i u m and c o l l u v i u m or to readjust
to low-flow conditions.
Unl ike perennial streams, ephemeral streams of the Seminole Canyon area do not possess pool and riffle sequences
typical of meandering streams (Leopold and others 1964).
However, Figure 1-4 shows that if the d i s t r i b u t i o n of major
gravel bars and/or g r a v e l - b o u l d e r accumulations are m a p p e d ,
a pattern s i m i l a r to a l l u v i a l channels emerges, Leopold and
others (1964) observed s i m i l a r gravel accumulations in Arroyo
de los Frijoles in New Mexico and observed that a l t h o u g h the
gravel is transported by i n d i v i d u a l flood flows, the zones
of a c c u m u l a t i o n remain r e l a t i v e l y stationary through time.
In Seminole and Presa canyons, the major zones of gravel
a c c u m u l a t i o n are on the i n s i d e s of meanders (point bars), in
the central parts of straight reaches exceeding 0.5 km, in
l e n g t h , and in areas of significant t a l u s a c c u m u l a t i o n . Other
wise, the canyon floors are r e l a t i v e l y devoid of a l l u v i u m .
These g r a v e l deposits are l i t t l e modified by minor flows.
Only the infrequent l a r g e m a g n i t u d e floods are c a p a b l e of
reshaping channel-floor a l l u v i u m .

GEOMORPHOLOGY OF THE S E M I N O L E CANYON DRAINAGE BASIN
D r a i n a g e B a s i n Morphometry

The d r a i n a g e basin serves as a geomorphic u n i t with regard to the i n p u t of r a i n f a l l and output of surface runoff
in the m a i n c h a n n e l . Basin morphometry plays a very important role in c o n t r o l l i n g the response to p r e c i p i t a t i o n . The
most s i g n i f i c a n t morphometric parameters relating to flood
response are basin area, d r a i n a g e density, first order channel
frequency, basin relief, ruggedness number, and basin shape.
These, and other parameters, are defined in Table 1-3. Table
1-4 shows the v a l u e s for the m o r p h o m e t r i c parameters in Seminole Canyon and how they compare with s i m i l a r studies in
other parts of the United States. Seminole Canyon b a s i n
morphometry compares closely with that of the lower PecosD e v i l s R i v e r region (Kochel 1980) and central Texas (Patton
and Baker 1976), suggesting rather flashy flood responses
would be expected. Drainage density, basin relief, and first
order channel frequency are h i g h , hence, the efficiency of
intercepting and c h a n n e l i n g p r e c i p i t a t i o n into the m a i n canyons
is r e l a t i v e l y h i g h . In a d d i t i o n , the Seminole Canyon basin
is fairly equant, therefore, runoff from various parts of the
basin a r r i v e s at downstream locations synchronously, contrib u t i n g to flashy downstream hydrographs.

S e m i n o l e and Presa canyons. Cross sections were surveyed at
each station u s i n g a hand l e v e l , t a p e , and stadia rod (Fig.

used to estimate flood peak d i s c h a r g e s . The M a n n i n g e q u a t i o n

These estimates suggest a peak d i s c h a r g e for the m o u t h
of Presa Canyon of about 1,350 m 3 / s (48,000 cfs) and a b o u t
1,750 m 3 / s (61,330 cfs) for S e m i n o l e Canyon just upstream
of the juncture w i t h Presa Canyon. A v e r a g e rates of runoff
for these d i s c h a r g e s are between 41 and 45 3 m /km 2 at peak

C h a n n e l Floors
Three d i s t i n c t i v e c h a n n e l floor m o r p h o l o g i e s occur in
S e m i n o l e and Presa canyons: open reaches floored by l i m e s t o n e
bedrock or t h i n (less than 1 m.) gravel m a n t l e s ; reaches choked
by a c c u m u l a t i o n s of b o u l d e r y t a l u s and a l l u v i u m w h i c h has entrapped finer s e d i m e n t s and p r o v i d e d a f o u n d a t i o n for v e g e t a t i o n ; a n d r e a c h e s d i s p l a y i n g v a r i o u s l a r g e - s c a l e bedforms,
such as g r a v e l bars, p e n d a n t b a r s , and p o i n t bars (Fig. 1-8)
s i m i l a r to those d e s c r i b e d by G u s t a v s o n (1978) on the Nueces
R i v er .
G r a v e l p o i n t bars occur a l o n g the i n n e r m a r g i n s of most
major m e a n d e r bends in S e m i n o l e Canyon. These p o i n t bars
t y p i c a l l y are g r a d e d from c o b b l e s to pea-sized g r a n u l e s from
their lower to upper surfaces. The vegetation t r i m - l i n e
a l o n g the u p p e r bar marks the a p p r o x i m a t e extent of recent
large discharges. In mixed-load and gravel streams, chute
bars (McGowen and Garner 1970) are formed, but none were

b o u l d e r s (Fig. I-8a). D u r i n g floods, these b o u l d e r s act as
flow o b s t a c l e s and e s t a b l i s h flow s e p a r a t i o n and horseshoe
vortex scour systems. After flood waters recede, a scoured
trough appears i m m e d i a t e l y upstream and lateral to the o b s t a c l e
Downstream, a narrow, elongated and s t r e a m l i n e d tail of g r a v e l
is deposited which represents the shape of m i n i m u m h y d r a u l i c
resistance ( m i n i m a l drag) d u r i n g flood flow. Pendants bars
are p a r t i c u l a r l y common in Presa Canyon near km. 0.6 and 1.0
and in S e m i n o l e Canyon near km. 0.3 and 1.2 (Fig. 1-4). In
open, g r a v e l - c o v e r e d reaches of the canyon, l a r g e m i d - c h a n n e l
l o n g i t u d i n a l bars are found (Fig. I-8b). These bars are typic a l l y 1 to 2 meters t h i c k , from 10 to 50 meters l o n g , and
e x h i b i t steep a v a l a n c h e faces of 35-40° up to a meter h i g h .
Longitudinal gravel bars are composed mostly of 1 to 4 cm.
diameter g r a v e l but c o n t a i n a w i d e assortment of g r a v e l sizes
in lesser q u a n t i t i e s . A l t h o u g h these bar types are most
common in straight stretches (-c.e. in Presa Canyon near km.
0.6, 1.3, 2.3 and S e m i n o l e Canyon km. 1.0), they a l s o occur
a l o n g some lower p o i n t bars (-i.e.. S e m i n o l e Canyon km. 0.9).
In other areas, s i g n i f i c a n t quantities of gravel are moved
in an i l l - d e f i n e d form. These areas are typified by s w e l l s
of g r a v e l and adjacent swales swept c l e a n to bedrock; l o c a l
relief of 1 to 2 meters is common. This type of g r a v e l
floor m o r p h o l o g y is found in Presa Canyon near km. 0.4, 1.6,
2.7, 3.1-3.5, and 4.0, and in S e m i n o l e Canyon near km. 0.2
and 1.3 (Fig. 1-4). A l l g r a v e l bedforms show s i g n s of recent
a c t i v i t y a n d , w i t h the e x c e p t i o n of p e n d a n t and p o i n t b a r s ,

same r e l a t i v e l o c a t i o n s t h r o u g h time as gravel is e x c h a n g e d

in a steady state. Leopold, Wolman and M i l l e r (1964) suggest
t h i s process in e p h e m e r a l streams is r e l a t e d to p o o l - r i f f l e
systems in p e r e n n i a l streams.
A l l u v i a l F i l l Remnants
A former e p i s o d e of v a l l e y a l l u v i u m and s u b s e q u e n t deg r a d a t i o n is suggested by the remnants of t h i s f i l l in some
rock shelters, s h a l l o w c h a n n e l - w a l l a l c o v e s , terraces in some

In this section, a brief down-canyon g e o m o r p h i c d e s c r i p tion of Presa Canyon w i l l be p r o v i d e d for the h i k e r . N u m b e r s

F i g u r e 1-4. At km. (0.2) several s m a l l t r i b u t a r i e s entering
Presa Canyon from the south are draped w i t h 1 to 2 meters of
slackwater sand representing 8 to 10 major floods. Each
flood u n i t is characterized by c o u p l e t s of l i m e s t o n e gravel
d e p o s i t e d by the tributary stream, o v e r l a i n by s i l t y l i m e stone sand from backwaters of Presa Canyon. The c h a n n e l
w a l l s are bounded by p r o m i n e n t concave bedrock flares about
3 meters h i g h and the floor contains numerous s o l u t i o n and
a b r a s i o n features characteristic of bedrock streams, such as
i n n e r c h a n n e l s , p o t h o l e s , and scattered g r a v e l bars (0.30.5). The c h a n n e l floor becomes i n c r e a s i n g l y strewn w i t h

major westward meander is approached. At km. (0,6), V a q u e r o

l a r g e l y on bedrock in a r e l a t i v e l y s t r a i g h t stretch. T h i n
a c c u m u l a t i o n s (1-2 m.) of g r a v e l in some areas form pendant

for the e x c a v a t i o n of the cave m a t e r i a l , ca. 6800 B.P.

S e m i n o l e Canyon, just downstream from Fate B e l l S h e l t e r .
At this site, the a l l u v i a l material is horizontally stratified, about a meter t h i c k , and rests about 6 meters above
the l o c a l S e m i n o l e Canyon c h a n n e l floor. The horizontal
beds in the s e d i m e n t s are s l i g h t l y deformed from l o a d i n g
and/or impact of overlying talus (Fig. 1-11). E v i d e n c e of
c l i m a t i c c h a n g e in southwest Texas (Bryant 1969; Bryant and
Shafer 1977) i n d i c a t e s to me that the major e p i s o d e s of
t a l u s a c c u m u l a t i o n a l o n g the c h a n n e l w a l l s occurred in the
late Pleistocene when h u m i d , cool conditions promoted intense
c r y o c l a s t i s m . Because the a l l u v i u m is beneath the t a l u s ,
it must h a v e been deposited prior to this time. Across
from the mouth of a major tribuary to Seminole Canyon (km.
3.0, F i g . 1-4), a d d i t i o n a l r e m n a n t s of the a l l u v i a l f i l l

41VV545 (Shelter B, F i g . 1-4) contains more remnants of
this f l u v i a l f i l l i n g episode. Like the deposits under the
t a l u s , these g r a v e l s i n d i c a t e a m a x i m u m f i l l t h i c k n e s s between
6 to 8 meters a b o v e the present c h a n n e l floor. This degree
of f i l l is m u c h greater than that typically produced by catas t r o p h i c floods in Texas bedrock streams (Baker 1977; Patton
and Baker 1977; Kochel 1980) .

Downstream from V a q u e r o S h e l t e r , Presa Canyon makes a
s h a r p bend to the r i g h t . In this area, the c h a n n e l rests on
bedrock, except for a few pendant gravel a c c u m u l a t i o n s in the
lee of large talus boulders (0.6-1.0). Toward 41VV212 (Shelter C, F i g . 1-4) (1.0-1.4), i n c r e a s i n g amounts of g r a v e l
a p p e a r i n t h e c h a n n e l . Large l o n g i t u d i n a l bars w i t h steep
a v a l a n c h e faces 1 to 2 meters h i g h occur. S e e p a g e from
ephemeral springs has truncated some of the bars, exposing
bedrock floors 1 to 2 meters below the bar surfaces (1.21.3). At km. (1.4), Presa Canyon turns s h a r p l y r i g h t . Here,
the c h a n n e l is choked w i t h 3 to 4 meters of b o u l d e r s and
gravel w h i c h s u p p o r t scattered trees and s h r u b s . A r o u n d the
outside of the bend is a sediment ring probably left by a
high-water pool. A large point bar deposit on the i n s i d e
of the bend is graded from boulders and c o b b l e s to pea-sized
g r a v e l and sand (1.4-1.5). Just downstream from the bend
(1.6), a l o n g the outer w a l l , a l a r g e a c c u m u l a t i o n of t a l u s

As the canyon a p p r o a c h e s a major l o o p to the left (1.72.2) the c h a n n e l opens up into a b e d r o c k c h a n n e l with a 3 to
4 m e t e r - d e e p central inner c h a n n e l . At 41VV222, Shelter D
(Fig. 1-4) (2.5-2.6), the Presa channel is f i l l e d by a large
gravel p o i n t bar at a major bend to the right. Parsons (1962)

afforded by the l o c a t i o n of the shelter above the l e v e l of
flood flows and by the b u t t r e s s i n g effect of large roof f a l l
blocks at the cave entrance.
The l o n g , s t r a i g h t reach of Presa Canyon (3.0-3.6) below
B l a c k Cave contains large t a l u s b l o c k s a n d a l l u v i a l g r a v e l .
Some blocks are house-sized and r e t a i n gravel s w e l l s up to

the a l l u v i a l f i l l p i c t u r e d in F i g u r e I-9c. From km. (3.8)

41VV545 (Shelter B, F i g . 1-4) is on the outside of the
next meander bend to the right. This shelter is partially
s h i e l d e d from f l u v i a l erosion by large blocks from roof-fa 11
at its entrance (1.4-1.5). Shelter B provides an excellent
record of f l u v i a l f i l l i n g up to 8 meters above the channel
floor. The r o u n d e d , cross-stratified, and imbricated f l u v i a l
sediments dominate the f i l l , and are interstratified with
platy a n g u l a r roof e b o u l i s (Fig. 1-12).
In this straight bedrock reach between 41VV545 and Fate
Bell Shelter (1.5-2.1), few gravel bars occur. Along the
left wall of a tributary entering the canyon from the north
(2.0) are c a l i c h i f i e d sediments from the a l l u v i a l f i l l i n g
episode. Along the outside wall of the next major bend to
the left (1.25) are two l a r g e rockshelters, Fate B e l l (1.25)
and the Annex (1.2). In Fate Bell Shelter, the roof an
w a l l s are actively exfoliating w h i c h poses an immediate
threat to some of the p a i n t i n g s . The north-northeast exposure permits winter winds and rains access to the site.
Both Fate Bell and the Annex lie well a b o v e documented peak
flood stages in Seminole Canyon, and neither contain any
record of f l u v i a l sedimentation.
In the next few hundred meters (2.2-2.5) large housesized talus blocks have caused an a c c u m u l a t i o n of fine-grained
cobbles and g r a v e l . About 100 meters downstream from Fate
B e l l on the r i g h t bank, the a l l u v i a l fill r e m n a n t s are overl a i n by talus (Fig. 1-11) (2.3). A l o n g the left bank, just
opposite a major tributary entering from the west (2.8) yet
another remnant of the former a l l u v i a l f i l l occurs in a small
bedrock wall a l c o v e about 7 meters above the channel floor.
A p p r o a c h i n g the major bend to the left of S e m i n o l e
Canyon (3.8), increasing amounts of t a l u s are in the c h a n n e l .
For the most part, Seminole Canyon is c l e a r of a l l u v i u m or
t a l l u v i u m between km. 2.5 and the c o n f l u e n c e with Presa Canyon.
An inner s o l u t i o n channel has formed a l o n g this reach and
follows an irregular course in the c h a n n e l floor.
STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ROCKSHELTERS

Major rockshelters in the Park are shown in Figure 1-4.
A l l except V a q u e r o Shelter lie a l o n g the o u t s i d e of meander

Major factors w h i c h affect the p r e s e r v a t i o n p o t e n t i a l
of the p a i n t i n g s i n c l u d e direction of exposure, the presence
of buffer b l o c k s , l o c a t i o n w i t h respect to the f l u v i a l r e g i m e ,
e x f o l i a t i o n , joint frequency, bed t h i c k n e s s , and the a c t i v i t i e s

the s h e l t e r l i e s above the m a x i m u m flood stage, the p o t e n t i a l

the other two s h e l t e r s d e s c r i b e d , the floor of t h i s shelter
is e s s e n t i a l l y at l o c a l base l e v e l . Therefore, most of the
shelter l i e s w i t h i n the modern flood regime. The basal 2
meters of rounded limestone gravel and cobbles rest on top
of the angular e b o u l i s . The gravel u n i t is dominantly horizontally bedded. However, in some areas, large-scale foreset cross-beds i n d i c a t e a down-canyon flow d i r e c t i o n (toward

Comparison W i t h Other Rockshelters
S e m i n o l e Canyon rockshelters appear to have formed by
a c o m b i n a t i o n of processes i n c l u d i n g cryoclastic a c t i v i t y ,
f l u v i a l erosion, differential weathering, and exfoliation
u n r e l a t e d to frost a c t i o n . R o c k s h e l t e r s formed by one or
more of these processes h a v e been d e s c r i b e d t h r o u g h o u t

parts of the world (Farrand 1975; L a v i l l e and others 1980).
The formative sequence for the Seminole Canyon shelters

the cycle is repeated. Groundwater g e n e r a l l y becomes concentrated at s l o p e breaks l i k e those at the rear base of the
rockshelters and promotes s a p p i n g and s u b s e q u e n t roof c o l l a p s e .
Once formed, the s h e l t e r s may be f i l l e d by deposits from
many processes, i n c l u d i n g c r y o c l a s t i s m , f l u v i a l processes,
eolian processes, s o l i f 1 u c t i o n , and human a c t i v i t y ( L a v i l l e
and others 1980). Cryoclastic deposits tend to be a n g u l a r
and platy in form. Clast size appears to be a function of
the c l i m a t i c regime in w h i c h they were produced. Studies
of e b o u l i s in Bonfire Shelter, a few km. west of Seminole
Canyon (Dibble and Lorrain 1968), and in the Perigord
region of France ( L a v i l l e and others 1980) suggest that
periods of intense, d e e p - p e n e t r a t i n g freezes tend to produce coarse e b o u l i s ; m i l d e r h u m i d c l i m a t e produces l a r g e
a m o u n t s of fine e b o u l i s s i n c e the e x f o l i a t i o n is l i m i t e d
to s h a l l o w depths along shelter walls and c e i l i n g s .
G e o m o r p h i c e v i d e n c e suggests that the major f i l l i n g
episode occurred in the Pleistocene. S i m i l a r sedimentation
in nearby Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain 1968) and in
shelters of Abri Pataud in France (Farrand 1975) is of late
Pleistocene a g e .
From a pa 1 e o c l i m a t i c v i e w p o i n t , it would be v a l u a b l e
to know whether limestone s p a l l is a c t i v e l y forming today in
these r o c k s h e l t e r s . Since the a c c u m u l a t i o n of such debris
is r e l a t i v e l y slow and r a n d o m , such data are very d i f f i c u l t
t o o b t a i n . A d d i t i o n a l c o m p l i c a t i o n s a r i s e s i n c e r e l i c hunters
h a v e d i s t u r b e d the c h a r a c t e r of flo.or d e p o s i t s in recent years.
For the most part, in the s h e l t e r s , s i g n i f i c a n t q u a n t i t i e s of
e b o u l i s do not appear to be a c c u m u l a t i n g . However, a l o n g
some of the canyon w a l l s , i n c i p i e n t shelters may be forming
where limestone blocks have s p a l l e d . The appearance of patches
of w a l l , d e v o i d of desert v a r n i s h , also suggests recent rockf a l l s . U n t i l lengthy q u a l i t a t i v e studies are conducted to
measure present rates of s p a l l and/or t a l u s a c c u m u l a t i o n
and some method of q u a n t i f y i n g rates of desert v a r n i s h formation is d e v e l o p e d , a n u n e q u i v o c a l p a l e o c l i m a t i c i n t e r p r e t a t i o n
of s h e l t e r s t r a t i g r a p h i e s can not be m a d e based s o l e l y on the
p h y s i c a l a p p e a r a n c e s . A d d i t i o n a l c o m p l i c a t i o n s occur because
the p r e c i s e m e c h a n i s m w h i c h produces the e b o u l i s is not f u l l y
understood (Farrand 1975). Most workers a t t r i b u t e e b o u l i s
directly to freeze-thaw action in areas of seeping water or
atmospheric precipitation. It is not known, for e x a m p l e , to
what extent a l t e r n a t e wetting and drying w i t h o u t frost action
can i n d u c e s p e l l i n g . For that matter, there is c o n s i d e r a b l e
controversy over the r e l a t i v e effectiveness of the intensity
(magnitude) and frequency of frost-thaw c y c l e s in frost-wedging
(French 1976; W a s h b u r n 1979; L a v i l l e and others 1980). Laboratory e x p e r i m e n t s h a v e not succeeded in m i m i c k i n g P l e i s t o c e n e

indicate that small fragments are produced by more and h i g h e r
s a t u r a t i o n of the bedrock. These e x p e r i m e n t s a l s o showed
that l a r g e r q u a n t i t i e s of d e b r i s per freeze-thaw cycle are
produced by greater frost intensity and h i g h e r bedrock saturat i o n . Therefore, the size and quantity of s p a l l are a
c o m p l i c a t i n g factor in p a l e o c l i m a t i c i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s . In
g e n e r a l , the size of the eboulis appears to be i n v e r s e l y
p r o p o r t i o n a l to the frequency and i n t e n s i t y of freeze-thaw
cycles and saturation of the bedrock w h i l e the q u a n t i t y
produced is directly p r o p o r t i o n a l to these factors (Farrand
1975).
C o n s i d e r a b l y less f i n e - g r a i n e d e b o u l i s is e v i d e n t in
Sem.inole Canyon shelters than was encountered in B o n f i r e
Shelter ( D i b b l e and Lorrain 1968). M u c h of the fine s e d i ment in Bonfire is a t t r i b u t e d to runoff from the adjacent
s l o p e s of a l a r g e t a l u s cone. R a d i o c a r b o n dates of b i s o n
bone beds in Bonfire Shelter i n d i c a t e that the major e p i s o d e
of s p a l l formation at the base of the site was P l e i s t o c e n e
( D i b b l e and Lorrain 1968). D i b b l e interpreted the a l t e r n a t i n g strata of fine- and c o a r s e - g r a i n e d e b o u l i s to p a l e o c l i m a t e . The basal bouldery zone is b e l i e v e d to have formed
i n a moi s t c l i m a t e characterized by frequent freeze-thaw
cycles (late Pleistocene). O v e r l y i n g f i n e - g r a i n e d l i m e s t o n e
s p a l l s a n d s i l t suggested p r o g r e s s i v e c h a n g e toward i n c r e a s i n g
a r i d i t y . These i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s are supported by the p a l y n o l o g i c a l record from the A m i s t a d r e g i o n (Bryant 1969; Bryant and
Shafer 1977). P o l l e n from the basal b o u l d e r y s p a l l u n i t were
predominantly pine and suggest a f u l l - g l a c i a l climate with
a v e r a g e m i d - s u m m e r temperatures a b o u t 4 to 5°C below present
(Bryant 1969). U n f o r t u n a t e l y , the sedimentary record in
S e m i n o l e Canyon is not s u f f i c i e n t l y v a r i e d or d e t a i l e d to

evinced from t h e u n s t a b l e b l o c k s i n c h a n n e l w a l l s , i n c i p i e n t

Rockshelters form in thick-bedded limestone units along
the o u t s i d e of l a r g e meanders.
Cryoclastism, solution, dess i c a t i o n , h y d r a t i o n , differential w e a t h e r i n g , and other processes l i k e l y played a major role in the formation and sedim e n t a t i o n of these shelters.

probably i n v o l v e d in localizing the d e v e l o p m e n t of rockshelters.
D u r i n g l a r g e f l o o d s , m a c r o t u r b u l e n t e r o s i o n a l processes, such
as c a v i t a t i o n (Barnes 1956), are c a p a b l e of d e l i v e r i n g shock

were i n i t i a t e d , the c h a n n e l floors may h a v e been h i g h e r .
Studies of slackwater sedimentation in the lower Pecos R i v e r
i n d i c a t e s that between 1 and 4 meters of d o w n c u t t i n g may h a v e
occurred in t h i s area d u r i n g the past 10,000 years (Kochel
1980). Rockshelters above local flood stages were sedimentf i l l e d w i t h a n g u l a r e b o u l i s a n d later e x c a v a t e d . S h e l t e r s

c l e a n - s w e p t a p p e a r a n c e of bedrock c h a n n e l floors is in part
due to the tremendous competence of recent c a t a s t r o p h i c
flood flows such as the H u r r i c a n e A l i c e flood of J u n e 1954
w h i c h affected the entire lower Pecos-Devils R i v e r region.
Slope-area estimates of peak discharges in S e m i n o l e and Presa
canyons indicate that the flood was competent to transport
large boulders in suspension as the r a m p a g i n g waters were
confined between vertical canyon w a l l s . S i m i l a r floods are
capable of totally i n u n d a t i n g many rockshelters in the area
and would have removed traces of prehistoric occupation in
these sites. Only the sites more than 5 to 6 meters above
local c h a n n e l floors or with blocked e n t r a n c e s would h a v e
been spared f l u v i a l erosion. Factors affecting the preserv a t i o n of the p a i n t i n g s in these sites i n c l u d e d i r e c t i o n of
exposure to w i n d , r a i n , and s u n ; joint frequency; e x f o l i a t i o n ;
and the a c t i v i t i e s of man.

INTRODUCTION

An important part of the d e s c r i p t i o n of I n d i a n rock art
is a characterization of the mineral based pigments. These
m i n e r a l s can not be a d e q u a t e l y i d e n t i f i e d on the b a s i s of
color alone. The m e c h a n i s m s operative in the p r o d u c t i o n of
colors of p i g m e n t m i n e r a l s i n c l u d e the effects of electron
exchange between transition of the natural mineral pigments
used in their e x e c u t i o n . In this process, a t r a n s i t i o n metal
e l e m e n t - one of those elements in the m i d d l e of the p e r i o d i c
chart - is present w i t h i n a m i n e r a l in the form of ions
whose electronic charges are continuously fluctuating between
two different v a l u e s . This charge f l u c t u a t i o n is caused by
a c o n t i n u o u s exchange of electrons between ions, and as the
charge of each ion changes, a s m a l l amount of energy is
absorbed or emitted. If the amount of energy i n v o l v e d in
the electron transfer f a l l s w i t h i n the range of the v i s i b l e
part of the electro-magnetic spectrum, color results. The
colors of most p i g m e n t m i n e r a l s are thus caused by the presence
of major concentrations of such transition metal elements
as iron and manganese.
These colors may be m o d i f i e d by the
presence of i m p u r i t i e s of other t r a n s i t i o n m e t a l e l e m e n t s
such as v a n a d i u m , c h r o m i u m , and n i c k e l . The a p p e a r a n c e of
p i g m e n t m i n e r a l s can be futher modified by the manner in
w h i c h l i g h t is scattered by the i n d i v i d u a l m i n e r a l g r a i n s
w i t h i n the p i g m e n t , and so is therefore d e p e n d e n t upon the
sizes and shapes of these g r a i n s . Thus it is a p p a r e n t that
color may not be an accurate manner in which to judge the
m i n e r a 1 o g i c a l c o m p o s i t i o n of a p a i n t p i g m e n t . M i n e r a l o g i c a l
i d e n t i f i c a t i o n s can be made on a m u c h sounder b a s i s u s i n g
x-ray diffraction.
When a sample is irradiated with x-rays a portion of
these rays are reflected from p l a n e s of atoms in the s a m p l e
as from a mirror. This is c a l l e d d i f f r a c t i o n . At a p a r t i c u l a r a n g l e for each p a r a l l e l set of p l a n e s the reflected
x-ray beam w i l l be at a m a x i m u m . A t a b u l a t i o n of these
a n g l e s , a l o n g w i t h the intensity of each reflected beam, can
act as a s i g n a t u r e and be used as a m e a n s of i d e n t i f i c a t i o n .
In order to correctly identify a s u b s t a n c e , however, it is
necessary to i r r a d i a t e a sample from a l l p o s s i b l e d i r e c t i o n s
in order that a l l p o s s i b l e atomic p l a n e s can be b r o u g h t to
their u n i q u e r e f l e c t i n g o r i e n t a t i o n w i t h respect to the
i n c i d e n t x-ray beam. This c o n d i t i o n can be met by g r i n d i n g
up a s a m p l e , as is u s u a l l y done, and p l a c i n g the powdered

sample Ln to to into the x-ray beam. The assumption here
is that each g r a i n is in a random orientation w i t h respect
to all others, and when taken together grains are present
in all p o s s i b l e orientations. The weakness of t h i s method
is that many grains of a sample are necessary in order to
insure that a complete powder pattern w i l l be collected.
If only one grain is a v a i l a b l e for a n a l y s i s , it is
necessary to rotate the sample within the x-ray beam in such
a way as to bring all of the atomic p l a n e s to their diffracting
positions. This condition is e s s e n t i a l l y met by the G a n d o l f i
x-ray camera (Fig. II-l). In this camera the sample is
s i m u l t a n e o u s l y rotated about two i n c l i n e d axes. The development of the Gandolfi x-ray camera has made p o s s i b l e the
nondestructive characterization of even s i n g l e crystals
under ten micrometers in diameter, many times smaller than
the previous m i n i m u m sample-size requirement. Thus, the
study of v a l u a b l e objects, such as rock art pigments, can be
a c c o m p l i s h e d without causing v i s i b l e damage.
E X P E R I M E N T A L METHODS

A finely drawn l i n d e m a n n glass c a p i l l a r y was placed into
a G a n d o l f i camera sample mount (see Fig. Il-la) and was
anchored into place with some "Cenco tackiwax". The free
end of this c a p i l l a r y was then drawn to a t h i c k n e s s c o m p a r a b l e
to that of the sample by touching it to a heated p l a t i n u m
wire and p u l l i n g it q u i c k l y away. The g r a i n to be i d e n t i f i e d
was fastened to the end of the resultant glass fiber with
either "Cenco tackiwax", c o l l o d i o n d i s s o l v e d in amyl acetate,
or clear n a i l p o l i s h . The last a d h e s i v e was preferred because
it did not scatter x-rays as much as did the former two.
The sample h o l d e r was then mounted into the Gandolfi camera
(see Fig. Il-lb) and was a l i g n e d so that the sample was at
the exact center of the camera. The s a m p l e centering had to
be precisely done in order that a usable x-ray pattern could
be c o l l e c t e d in the least time. F i l m was wrapped around the
sample, i n s i d e the camera, and recorded the a n g u l a r p o s i t i o n s
and i n t e n s i t i e s of the diffracted x-ray beams. Run d u r a t i o n s
varied up to six days, d e p e n d i n g upon the v o l u m e and density
of the s a m p l e .
E X P E R I M E N T A L RESULTS A N D DISCUSSION

The r e s u l t i n g m i n e r a l o g i c a l i d e n t i f i c a t i o n s of the p i g m e n t s
are shown i n Table I I - l . The clear i n c r u s t a t i o n a l m a t e r i a l
was gypsum - CaSOi»'2H 2 0 - and calcite - CaC0 3 . These m i n e r a l s
are i n d i c a t e d in parentheses in Table I I - l . Both of these
phases are u b i q u i t o u s in arid regions.

AMALVS1S OP PIGMENT

The black pigment was shown to consist of either h o l l a n d i t e
- B a M n 8 O i 6 . m a n g a n i t e - M n O O H , or p y r o l u s i t e - MnOz •
These are a l l common m a n g a n e s e oxides w h i c h can be expected
in desert areas. Other manganese oxides may be identified
in future a n a l y s e s ; however, these three m i n e r a l s are probably sufficient to permit the separation of b l a c k p i g m e n t s
at t h i s time.
The red to y e l l o w p i g m e n t s c o n s i s t , either a l o n e or together, of maghemite - jFezQ3 (a rare form of iron oxide),
l e p i d o c r o s i t e - yFeOOH, hematite - Fe 3 0 4 , g o e t h i t e - jFeQ(OH),
and a k a g a n e i t e - 3FeOOH. Of these m i n e r a l s , h e m a t i t e is
generally g i v e n as the constituent of red p i g m e n t . L i m o n i t e ,
a m i x t u r e of 1 e p i d o c r o c i t e and other iron h y d r o x i d e s , is
usually c a l l e d upon as the constituent of yellow pigment or
ocher. It is i n t e r e s t i n g to note that p i g m e n t s w h i c h range
in color from red to y e l l o w can a c t u a l l y consist of a l m o s t
any combination of these iron oxides and hydroxides, i n d i c a t i n g
that the specific iron m i n e r a l s present in the p i g m e n t can
not be predicted from the pigment's color.
The m i n e r a l o g i c a l c o m p l e x i t y of the i d e n t i f i e d p i g m e n t s
can p r o b a b l y serve as a basis for r e g r o u p i n g artworks.
D u p l i c a t e samples, taken from the same figures and run
separately, reflected the same m i n e r a l o g i c a l c o m p o s i t i o n s ,
thus supporting the hypothesis that particular pigments can
be a c c u r a t e l y m i n e r a l o g i c a l l y c h a r a c t e r i z e d .
In order to d e t e r m i n e if s u p e r i m p o s e d p i g m e n t s can be
m i n e r a l o g i c a l l y d i s c r i m i n a t e d , samples from three overpainted
p a n e l s were e x a m i n e d (Table II-2). In a l l cases, the p i g ments from s e q u e n t i a l l y o v e r p a i n t e d artworks were found to
c o n s i s t of d i s t i n c t l y different m i n e r a l o g i e s . The v a r i a t i o n
d i s p l a y e d by the second g r o u p i n g is exactly m i r r o r e d by that
in the third g r o u p i n g , possibly i n d i c a t i n g that the lower
p a i n t i n g s were executed synchronously, as were the later
p a i n t i n g s . In a d d i t i o n , the m i n e r a l o g y of the e a r l i e s t
p a i n t i n g in the second and t h i r d sequences is i d e n t i c a l to
the m i n e r a l o g y of the e a r l i e s t p a i n t i n g of the first sequence,
possibly i n d i c a t i n g that these works were executed synchron o u s l y as w e l l .
F i n a l l y , a p o s s i b l e e x a m p l e of smoke b l a c k e n i n g on the
c e i l i n g of Fate B e l l Shelter was s a m p l e d (Table II-l). T h i s
s a m p l e was shown to a c t u a l l y c o n s i s t of iron and m a n g a n e s e
oxides. This may be an example of an artwork w h i c h has
l a r g e l y been eroded away, or o x i d e s w h i c h have b l e d from an
adjacent, h i g h e r p a i n t i n g . Some c a u t i o n has to be exercised
in the x-ray a n a l y s i s of smoke b l a c k e n i n g , however, as more
s t r o n g l y x-ray s c a t t e r i n g iron a n d m a n g a n e s e m i n e r a l s w o u l d
effectively mask the presence of any carbon s t a i n i n g .

support to the hypothesis that a characterization of the
m i n e r a l o g i c a l c o m p o s i t i o n of p a i n t p i g m e n t s can serve as a
basis for the regrouping of artworks. How these regroupings
can serve in the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the rock art has yet to
be shown, but there is an i n d i c a t i o n that it w i l l be p o s s i b l e
to detect w h i c h p a i n t i n g s were executed synchronously.
More d e t a i l e d work w i l l be needed before t h i s h y p o t h e s i s ,
or any other, can be seriously advanced.
