ABSTRACT
The Madison County Special Utility District (SUD) plans to install 3.3 miles of
new six-inch water line in Madison and Walker counties, Texas. Only one mile
(3.64 acres) of the total project area was required to be examined by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC). Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA)
conducted the field survey on May 21, 2014 and Antiquities Permit 6882 was
awarded to this project. The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore of BVRA.
Jesse Todd (Project Archaeologist) and Brett Lang (Field Assistant) conducted the
fieldwork. The duration of the field survey (two persons) was 24 hours including
travel to and from the project area. No prehistoric or historic sites were found and it
is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as planned.
Copies of the final report will be housed at the THC, the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library, the Madison County SUD,
various repositories, and BVRA. The records and all relevant documents will be
placed in permanent curation at the Sam Houston Memorial Museum in Huntsville,
Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The Madison County SUD plans to install 3.3 miles of 6-inch waterline
along Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 247 in Madison and Walker counties (Figure 1)
with the vast majority of construction (92.5 %) to take place in Madison County.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is entirely within Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) right-of-way (ROW) associated with F.M. 247. The
linear AP, which has been estimated at 30 feet wide, begins in Walker County
about 120 meters south of Bedias Creek where an existing waterline will connect
to the proposed one in Madison County (Figure 2). From this beginning point, it
will proceed along the east side of FM 247 for a distance of approximately 2350
feet. Then, it shifts to the west side of the road and continues for a distance of
approximately 2930 feet at which point further archaeological survey is not
required. The width of the trench for the waterline will be 24â and the pipe will
have a minimum of 5 feet of cover.
There are two stream crossings depicted on the topographic quadrangle. A
third drainage is a very minor gully that is almost indiscernible in the field as a
former stream channel. The flowing streams are Bedias Creek and the upper
reaches of a tributary of Bedias Creek. The tributary crosses the road in two
places. The branch to the north is defined here as a âcutoff channel.â Bedias
Creek will be crossed using the horizontal directional boring method and the pipe
will be installed at a depth of at least 10 feet below the lowest point of the existing
creek bed, estimated to be 40 feet below the ground surface. The entry point will
be approximately 260 feet south of the creek and the exit point will be
approximately 250 feet north of the creek.
The tributary is located approximately 1600 feet north of Bedias Creek and
will also be crossed using the horizontal directional boring method. The proposed
entry point will be approximately 90 feet south of the tributaryâs southern bank and
the proposed exit point will be approximately 100 feet north of the tributaryâs
northern bank. The pipe will be installed at the same depth as at Bedias Creek.
The project area is depicted on the 7.5â USGS topographic quadrangle Baker Lake
(3095-343).
The vegetation in the APE is mixed. The predominant trees consisted of
scattered oaks. Plants comprising the understory were identified in the field as
blackeyed-susans, saw greenbriar, prickly pear cactus, grama grasses,
buttercups, various berry vines, and other miscellaneous perennial species.

The proposed water line passes through three soil types and very close to
a fourth. The types definitely in the APE are identified in the soil survey by
Neitsch (1994:Sheet 23) as Elmina loamy fine sand, 1 to 3 percent slopes (EmB),
Gowker clay loam, frequently flooded (Go), and Tonkavar loamy fine sand, 1 to 8
percent slopes (ToD). At the crossing of Bedias Creek in Walker County, the
water line passes in or very near an area of Nahatche loam, frequently flooded
(Na).

The Elmina soils are described by Neitsch (1994:26) as those found in the
uplands and on divides. Although these soils can consist of deep sands to 58
inches, other soils in this series are much more shallow with clay occurring
sometimes at 10 inches or less beneath the surface. This soil also has a
perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet.
Gowker soils are described by Neitsch (1994:31) as occurring in the
floodplains of minor streams. Areas where this soil is present are known to flood
at least once every two years for several days. A perched high water table is
found at a depth of 0.5 to 2.5 feet. In a typical profile, the surface layer consists
of clay and clay loam to a depth of about 45 inches. Some form of clay loam
continues to a depth of at least 80 inches in most cases.
Tonkavar soils are described by Neitsch (1994:44) as an upland soil with a
surface layer of loamy fine sand about 6 inches thick. Loamy soils continue until
they reach a stratum of weakly cemented sandstone at 80 inches or less.
The Walker County portion of the APE passes through or very close to a
mapped area of Nahatche loam. This soil is described by Neitsch (1994:37) as a
level soil found on the flood plains of small streams and some rivers. It floods
more often than one every two years for a few days. The seasonal high water
table of 0.5 to 1.5 feet keeps this soil saturated for periods of a few days to a few
weeks, mainly during the winter and early spring.
The tributary located approximately 1600 feet north of Bedias Creek will also
be crossed using the horizontal directional boring method. The proposed entry
point will be approximately 90 feet south of the tributaryâs southern bank and the
proposed exit point will be approximately 100 feet north of the tributaryâs northern
bank. The pipe will be installed at the same depth as at Bedias Creek.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the presence of previously recorded
sites and surveys in the project area and vicinity. The soil surveys for Madison
County (Neitsch 1994) and Walker County (McClintock et al. 1979) were checked
for the types of soils within the APE. Relevant archaeological reports documenting
work in the two counties were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of
prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. The Principal Investigator and
Project Archaeologist performed these tasks.
The field survey was conducted on May 21, 2014 by Jesse Todd (Project
Archaeologist) and Brett Lang who was his assistant. The first two tests were
dug with shovels and an auger was used to excavate the rest of the tests
because the underlying B-Horizon could not be reached with shovels. The
excavated soil was screened using quarter-inch hardware cloth. The results of
testing were documented by a Log of Shovel and Auger Tests (Appendix I) and
field notes. Eighteen tests were excavated and all holes were backfilled.
The field survey began at the north end at Nauls Road and proceeded in a
general south-to-southeast direction. The end point is about 100 meters south of
Bedias Creek and about 20 meters south of the borehole exit point. All tests were
spaced 100 meters apart except where otherwise noted on the Log of Shovel and
Auger Tests. Munsell readings were taken of the soil in each test and recorded in
the field notes. The first 10 tests were dug on the west side of FM 247. They were
excavated in ditches and along the edges of benches or hills when possible. Tests
were dug until the B-Horizon or a natural obstacle was reached. These obstacles
consisted of clay, sandstone bedrock, disturbed soils, stream deposited soils, or
what appeared to be a perched water table.
Test 11 was placed about 10 meters north of the point where the proposed
water line turns to the east and crosses FM 247 through boring. It was dug at the
entry point and Test 12 was dug on the east side of the road at the exit point close
to the cutoff channel. Tests 13-17 were dug on the east side of the road with
number 13 placed about 100 meters south of Test 12 and about 3 meters north of
the main channel of the tributary. Test 14 was placed about 3 meters south of the
tributary and encountered bedrock. Tests 15-17 were placed 100 meters apart and
dug until wet soils prevented further excavation. The final test (18) was placed at
the entry point for boring beneath Bedias Creek. It was dug on the south side of
the creek and was the only test excavated in Walker County.
Location information was obtained through the USGS 7.5â topographic
quadrangle Baker Lake and a hand-held GPS. The project was documented
through field notes, various forms, and digital photography (see Appendix II).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Madison County is poorly represented in the archaeological record in
terms of numbers of site recorded. The project area is located in the Prairie
Savanna Archeological Study Region of the Eastern Planning Region as defined
by the Department of Antiquities Protection (now Archeology Division) in
Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:6) (Figure 3). According to Kenmotsu and Perttula
(1993:11), Madison County in 1997 contained 0.001 - 0.1 site per square mile
and was one of the counties with the lowest density of recorded sites in Texas.
Although Madison County is located in the Prairie-Savanna study region, as
defined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), it is immediately adjacent to the
Southeast Texas planning region to the south and the Northeast Texas planning
region to the east (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:6). Therefore, Madison County
probably shares cultural traits with these nearby regions.
As of May 26, 2014, there were 43 prehistoric sites, 9 historic sites, and 4
sites with prehistoric and historic components recorded at TARL (Appendix III).
Archaeological investigations that have recorded sites in Madison County include
a survey of the proposed Milican Reservoir by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. (Kotter
1982), a survey of a transmission line by Jane Rathbun (1982), a survey of
borrow pit sites on the Ferguson Unit in Madison County by Molly F. Godwin
(1998), a survey along State Highway 21 by William E. Moore (2005), a survey of
land on the Ferguson Unit in Madison County by Timothy K. Perttula and Bo
Nelson (2008, 2011), and a survey of a pipeline project by Rebecca Mehok et al.
(2012).
Other sites were recorded by individuals on personal time with the most
notable being sites 41MA27 â 41MA30 documented by the author (Moore 2013).
These sites are on private property and one of these (41MA27) contains an
abundance of artifacts from Paleo-Indian through Late Prehistoric as well as
Caddoan sherds. The artifacts are surface finds but they represent a long-term
occupation with evidence of trade or interaction with other groups. One of the
more significant finds at this site is a Pelican point (Figure 4) made of
Georgetown Chert, a raw material only found in an area approximately 150 miles
to the west. These sites are also significant because of an abundance of
ceramics, including fragments of Caddoan vessels that were described by
Timothy K. Perttula (2013a, 2013b) in the Journal of Northeast Texas
Archaeology and La Tierra.

It is difficult to identify sites according to type or function in many cases
because of limited data collected during a Phase I survey. Types of prehistoric sites,
according to site forms and reports, in Madison County are lithic scatters, camps (one
with burials), and unknown prehistoric. Caddo ceramics have been found at
41MA27-41MA30 (Perttula 2013); but there is no evidence of a pure Caddo site in the
county. The age of prehistoric sites is also difficult to determine in most cases;
however, artifacts reported from the area suggest occupations from Paleo-Indian
times through the Late Prehistoric. Historic sites dating from the 19th century through
the present are common in the county and region.

9

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Examination of the files at TARL and the Atlas revealed that this area has
not been examined by a professional archaeologist and that no sites have been
recorded in the APE or nearby. Fifty-six prehistoric and historic sites in Madison
County have been recorded at TARL. Most prehistoric sites are located on sandy
hills and terraces adjacent to streams and artifacts from these sites date from the
Paleo-Indian period through the Late Prehistoric. Trade with distant groups is
indicated by artifacts at 41MA27 made from Georgetown chert and Caddoan
ceramics at sites 41MA27-41MA30.
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found and it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned with no further
consultation with the THC. Should evidence of an archaeological site be
encountered during the construction of the road, all work must stop until the THC
can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the THC.
