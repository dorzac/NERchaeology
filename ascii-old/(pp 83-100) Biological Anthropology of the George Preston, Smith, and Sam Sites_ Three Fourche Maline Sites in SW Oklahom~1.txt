BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE
GEORGE PRESTON, SMITH, AND SAM SITES:
Three Fourche Maline Sites
in Southeastern Oklahoma and Northeastern Texas

William M. Bass and Carol J. Loveland

ABSTRACT
The biological attributes of the Fourche Maline people of southeastern Oklahoma and northeastern Texas have been poorly documented due to the fragmentary nature of most of the burials. Skeletal material from three sites
(George Preston, Sam, and Smith) attributed to the Fourche Maline culture is
discussed. Cranial and postcranial measurements and interment practices from
these and other Fourche Maline sites are compared and evaluated. The data
suggest that the Fourche Maline people were characterized by rather high, long
skulls, with narrow foreheads. Flexed or semiflexed burials were most common,
but orientation of the head was extremely variable, indicating little concern for
that aspect of burial custom.

INTRODUCTION

The Fourche Maline culture of southeastern Oklahoma and northeastern
Texas has been known archeologically for many years. Bell and Baerreis (1951 :
27) suggested that the focus was an Archaic culture that had survived in basically
its original form through the Early and Middle Woodland stages. Chapman
(1952:140-143) and Bell and Baerreis (1951:27-33) felt that the sources of
Woodland influences in Fourche Maline came from the north or west. Orr
(1952:243-244) postulated that strong ties existed between Fourche Maline
and Tchefuncte. Tchefuncte was an Early Woodland culture dating to about
500 B.C. in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Later researchers (Sears 1964:269;
Greengo 1964:121) contested this early date and suggested that Fourche Maline
is most similar to Marksville and Troyville, which date from about 100 B.C. to
A.D. 500.
More recently Galm (!978a:244-245) reported that Bell had recommended
elevation of Fourche Maline to phase status and restriction of the designation
to the time encompassed by the Woodland period. A series of radiocarbon
dates from sites in the Wister Valley, Oklahoma, bracket this phase from about
A.D. 1 (perhaps as early as 200 B.C.) to between A.D. 800 and 1000 (Galm
and Flynn 1978:156). Radiocarbon dates from the McCutchan-McLaughlin
site range from 300 B.C. to A.D. 765 (Powell and Rogers 1980:Table 1).
Bell (1953:314), Orr (1952:242-243), and Wycoff (1970:98)characterized
this culture as exhibiting the following traits: (1) sites consisting of large accuBulletin of the Texas Archeological Society

mulations of village debris in the form of midden deposits, (2) flexed burials
(occasionally multiple) in middens, (3) rare occurrence of grave offerings, and
(4) artifacts and other debris (mussel shells, potsherds, animal bones, ftrecracked stones) scattered throughout the midden deposit. Galm has suggested
"that contracting stemmed (Gary Style) poifits and a thick ware ceramic type
(Williams Plain) may be the hallmarks of components of this phase" (Galm
1978b:74). He cautions, however, that use of these traits in the identification of
Fourche Maline components on a regional level is not desirable.
In work at the Scott site, Bell (1953:320) noted that most burials were not
marked by grave outlines. He suggested that the bodies were placed on the
ground surface and covered with debris from the surrounding midden. A similar
situation was noted at the Wann site by Sharrock (1960:22), at the Sam site
by Proctor (1957:49), and at the Williams Mound by Newkumet (1940:3).
However, Proctor did note that a few of the graves had been "scraped several
inches into the clean subsoil" (Proctor 1957:49). Galm and Flynn (1978:51)
reported that three burials from the Scott site were associated with distinct
pits ranging in depth from 20 cm to 62 cm; the remaining burials apparently
were not placed in specially prepared pits.
Many burials have been recovered from Fourche Maline sites, but most of
them are in fragmentary condition. Therefore, very few papers (Hammett 1978:
333-346; McWiltiams 1970:101-136; Powell and Rogers 1980:1-98) have included biological descriptions of Fourche Maline skeletal material. Hammett
(1978:333) examined 10 individuals from nine burials exposed at the Scott
site and three individuals from the Wann site; all of these burials were obtained
during the 1977-1978 Phase II Investigation of the sites by the University of
Oklahoma (Galm and Flynn 1978:3). In her report, Hammett included sex, age
of death, pathologies, interment conditions, and limited metric data (four
cranial measurements, two cranial indices, and stature estimation based on left
femur length) (Hammett 1978:333-346).
McWilliams (1970:101-136) looked primarily at nonmetric trait variation in
his comparison of the skeletal material from the Sam and Wann sites. However,
he did discuss burial practices, pathologies, and life expectancy in his report
and included some measurements (maximum length and breadth of the cranium
and several long bone measurements).
Powell and Rogers (1980:1-98), in their comprehensive report on the McCutchan-McLaughlin site, explored the nature and quality of the tifeway of the
Fourche Maline people as they considered such topics as demography, nonmetric traits, stature and sexual dimorphism, paleopathology, and interment
practices. Only limited measurements (primarily postcranial) were given in their
paper.
MATERIALS
In March 1979, Dave Wright, an amateur archeologist and part-time employee
of the Museum of the Red River in Idabel, Oklahoma, together with his wife,
Cindy, and a friend, Mike Lankford, excavated a multiple burial at the George
Preston site in northeastern Texas. Portions of three skeletons were recovered
and given to Dr. William M. Bass of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
The George Preston site is situated in extreme southern Lamar County on
an active floodplain bordering the North Sulphur River (Figure 1). The midden,

which is approximately 70 feet long and 25 feet wide, is oriented north-northwest to south-southeast.
A secondary and primary terrace system containing Caddoan materials occurs
to the north of the site. The soil type in the area is commonly referred to as
blackland gumbo. The region straddles the border between the post oak prairies
to the south and west and the pine forests to the east. Artifacts collected from
the vicinity of the midden consisted principally of Kent, Gary, and Yarborough
points. In the grave fill there were numerous small pieces of animal bone, potsherds, mussel shells, hickory nutshells, and copper fragments. Gregory Perino
(personal communication, September 3, 1980) attributed the burial to the
Fourche Maline focus.
In addition to the multiple burial discussed above, the writers have included
a summary of previously unpublished measurements taken by Bass in 1958 as
part of his work with the Smithsonian Institution Missouri Basin Project. The
burials are from the Sam and Smith sites, which are located in the Wister Valley
in LeFlore County, Oklahoma (Figure 2). The Sam site was excavated in 1940
in conjunction with the archeological work sponsored by the Works Progress
Administration (Proctor 1957:45-47). McWflliams (1970:101-136) reported
on some of the skeletal material presented here; however, the two samples are

not mutually inclusive. Furthermore, the major thrust of his investigations
centered around nonmetric traits; thus, he included only two cranial measurements-maximum length and breadth-and several long-bone measurements in
his discussion. The skeletal material from the Smith site has not been discussed
previously from a biological perspective.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The three skeletons from the George Preston site were oriented west to east,
with the heads at the west (Figure 3). They were all poorly preserved, the worst
being Burial 1, which was very fragmentary. The fragmentary nature of the
skeletal material made it impossible to obtain many measurements; those that
were taken, following Bass (1971:1-128), are given in Table 1. The nonmetric
traits that could be observed are given in Table 2. There was no visible grave
outline.
Burial 1 was a female in a semiflexed position, with the legs and sktfll turned
toward the right. The skull, which had some post-mortem warping, was dislocated up and away from the rest of the skeleton, probably as a result of
swelling and shifting of the soil. The skull was 48 cm below ground level. The
individual was determined to be 25-35 years of age, based upon dental attrition
(Miles 1963:204; Brothwell 1965:69).
Dental wear was advanced in the first molars. The left maxillary first molar
was worn unevenly, and the pulp cavity was exposed. Unfortunately, the
maxilla was missing, making it impossible to determine whether the tooth was
abscessed. The other teeth showed more flattened and less severe wear, with the
exception of the left mandibular first premolar, which had a peglike appearance.
The crown was almost worn away, and the tooth looked as if it might have been
broken.

Burial 2 was in a semiflexed position with the legs and skull facing left. The
right arm of Burial 2 was under the head of Burial 3. The left arm of Burial 2
also touched Burial 3. Perhaps Burial 3 was placed in the arms of Burial 2. The
skull was 48 cm below the surface, and the legs were 43 cm below ground level.
There was a lump of red ocher over the chest cavity, and some copper scraps
were found near the right hand. The ocher and copper had stained the first
and second metacarpals, the first proximal and distal phalanges, and one rib
fragment green. Analysis of epiphyseal closure (McKern and Stewart 1957:
1-179) indicated that the individual was 15 to 17 years old at the time of death.
Burial 3 was also semiflexed, with the skull facing left and the legs turned
toward the right. The skull was 45 cm below the surface and the legs were 43
cm below the surface. Burial 3 was determined to have been 2 to 4 years old
at the time of death, based upon analysis of tooth eruption (Ubelaker 1978 :
112-113) and length of long bones without epiphyses (Johnston 1962:249254).
No pathologies were noted on any of the skeletons.
Measurements could be made on only five burials recovered from the Smith
site (34LF22) (Table 3). Mean measurements were not calculated because the
sample was so small and the material was in such fragmentary condition. The
remaining 23 skeletons from the site were too fragmentary to measure. No
pathologies were noted on the Smith site burials.
Table 4 provides a brief description of the Sam site burials analyzed by Bass.
The mean measurements of those burials complete enough to measure are given

The numerical differences between males and females is undoubtedly due to
the vageries of preservation rather than to any differences in the burial practices
of the Fourche Maline people. The highest incidence of death occurred between the ages of 20 and 30 for females and between ages 30 and 40 for males.
Cranial proportions expressed as indices provide a useful way of describing
skeletal populations. Table 6 presents the traditional terms used to describe
cranial proportions (Vallois 1965:142-143) and includes indices derived from

the measurements of the Sam skeletal series as well as comparative indices that
were calculated from measurements given by McWflliams (1970:Table 12)and
Hammett (1978:Table 45). The data suggest that the Fourche Maline people
were characterized by rather high skulls and narrow foreheads. Skull shape,
reflected in the cranial index, ranged from narrow or longheaded to average or
medium. Eye orbits were medium. Phenice (1969:69-70) described a similar
cranial configuration for Hopewellian and Central Plains Woodland populations.
Stature estimates for several Fourche Maline populations are shown in Table
7. Male estimates range from 164.3 cm at the Scott site (Hammett 1978:Table
45) to 173.0 cm at the Wann site (McWilliams 1970:Table 4). Female stature
ranged from 159.4 cm at the McCutchan-McLaughlin site (Powell and Rogers
1980:Table 8) to 164.9 cm at the Wann site (McWilliams 1970:Table 4). However, different formulas were used for calculating stature in the two reports.
Because McWilliams (1970:103) used Trotter and Gleserâs (1958:Table 12)
formula for Mongoloid males to calculate the female stature, it is likely that
those estimates utilizing the formulas of Neumann and Waldman (1968:100)
provide the most accurate assessment of stature for the Fourche Maline females.
Interment practices at the Fourche Maline sites are summarized in Table 8.
The flexed position was utilized most commonly, followed by the semi flexed
position. Orientation of the body to the right side was slightly preferred over
orientation to the left side. Orientation of the body in the grave varied greatly
at all sites, indicating little concern for that aspect of burial custom. Most
graves resembled those at the George Preston site, in that there were no discernible grave outlines.
Metric analysis of the burials from the George Preston, Smith, and Sam sites
has added to our limited biological knowledge of the Fourche Maline people.
Further cultural and biological study of these and other Fourche Maline burials
would help to provide a more complete understanding of the Fourche Maline
people and their lifeway. If enough small studies are undertaken, there will
eventually be sufficient data available from which valid conclusions can be
drawn about the prehistoric inhabitants of the northeastern Texas - southeastern Oklahoma area.
