ABSTRACT

Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey for the proposed South Trunk Pipelines. The proposed project consists of two 8inch crude oil pipelines and an 8-inch gas pipeline, all of which are located south of Pecos, Texas and west
of Fort Stockton, Texas in Reeves and Pecos Counties, Texas. This report encompasses only the portion of
the proposed South Trunk Pipelines located on nine tracts of City of Fort Stockton lands in Reeves and
Pecos counties, Texas. The City of Fort Stockton is a political subdivision of the State of Texas. The portion
of the South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton lands is approximately 8.3 miles (13.4 km) in length
and is depicted on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) North of Tucker Hill, Tex. (1970) and
Tucker Hill, Tex. (1970) 7.5 Minute Quadrangle maps. The construction corridor consists of a 50 foot
(15.24 m) wide permanent pipeline right-of-way (ROW) and an additional 50 foot (15.24 m) wide
temporary workspace corridor. The cultural resources survey area of potential effect (APE) consists of the
8.3 mile (13.4 km) by 100 foot (30 m) corridor, totaling 100.7 acres (40.7 hectares).
The cultural resources investigation is intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Antiquities Code of Texas
and the cultural resources survey on City of Fort Stockton lands was completed under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 9014. The entire project was supervised by Gary D. Edington, an ENERCON archeologist who
meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth
in 36 CFR 61.
Prior to the survey, a search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) was conducted by Michael
M. Margolis to locate previously recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) properties, and State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Based on the Atlas, one
archeological site, 41RV7, has been previously recorded adjacent to the APE. An additional six sites,
41RV2, 41RV5, 41RV50, 41RV67, 41PC447, and 41PC448 have been previously recorded within 1-mile
of the APE. Only two of the sites, 41PC447 and 41PC448, have been previously recorded within 1-mile of
the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands. Only one previous archeological survey or study is mapped within
1-mile of the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands.
The cultural resources survey of the South Trunk Pipelines APE on City of Fort Stockton lands was
conducted January 24-26, 2019 by Cody Kiker and Steven Sykes. Reroutes were surveyed on April 8, 2019
by Cody Kiker and Chris Flowers. Portions of the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands were resurveyed on
August 22 and 23, 2019 by Cody Kiker. Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
The cultural resources survey of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines resulted in the recording of four
archeological sites. 41RV201 consists of portions of three poured-in-place formed concrete (PIPFC)
irrigation flumes. Site 41PC934 consists of portions of four similar PIPFC irrigation flumes. The flumes
extend east and west outside of the ROW, but only the portion within the ROW is included in the site. The
flumes are abandoned and no longer functional as they have cracked or broken or been demolished and
disconnected from water sources. These concrete flumes were built in the late 1940s to 1950s as
technologies improved and more materials became available for groundwater pumps after World War II.
With the exception of two one-square mile center pivot-irrigated agricultural fields, the fields formerly
watered by the irrigation flumes are no longer in cultivation. No evidence of intact cultural deposits,
additional features, cultural lenses, or additional cultural materials were observed at the three irrigation
flumes within 41RV201 or the four irrigation flumes within 41PC934. Site 41PC937 is a small lithic scatter
consisting of chert debitage located adjacent to the southernmost concrete flume within site 41PC934. Site
41PC935 is another small lithic scatter consisting of chert debitage. No evidence of diagnostic artifacts,
intact cultural deposits, features, cultural lenses, or additional cultural materials were observed at sites

41PC937 or 41PC935. Ground surface visibility was nearly 100 percent at all four sites. Due to surficial
gravels, cobbles, and caliche, as well as generally shallow soils grading to caliche, there is limited potential
for intact buried cultural deposits at the four sites. The condition of the irrigation flumes at sites 41RV201
and 41PC934 demonstrates an overall lack of integrity. Disturbances from cultivation at site 41PC937 have
also negatively impacted integrity at the site. Due to the lack of additional information potential, sites
41RV201, 41PC934, 41PC937, and 41PC935 are recommended as not eligible for listing on the NRHP or
designation as a SAL, and no further cultural resources investigations are recommended.
The cultural resources survey of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines APE on City of Fort Stockton lands
also resulted in the observation of 18 isolated finds (IFs). None of the 18 IFs observed are diagnostic, and
the majority consist of isolated chert flakes. The 18 IFs lack additional information potential and are
therefore not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or SAL listings.
The cultural resources survey of the South Trunk Pipelines APE did not result in finding any additional
historic or prehistoric artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites and no artifacts were collected on City of
Fort Stockton lands. Therefore, it is recommended that construction of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines
on City of Fort Stockton lands will have no effect on any historic property that may qualify for inclusion
on the NRHP or SAL listings. No further cultural resources investigations are recommended prior to
construction of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton lands. If cultural material,
including sites, features, or artifacts that are 50 years old or older are encountered within the APE during
construction of the South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton lands, work in the area must cease and
the regional THC Archeologist must be notified immediately.

INTRODUCTION

Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey for the proposed South Trunk Pipelines. The proposed project consists of two 8inch crude oil pipelines and an 8-inch gas pipeline, all of which are located south of Pecos, Texas and west
of Fort Stockton, Texas in Reeves and Pecos Counties, Texas (Figure 1). This report encompasses only the
portion of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines located on nine tracts of City of Fort Stockton lands in
Reeves and Pecos Counties. Texas. The City of Fort Stockton is a political subdivision of the State of Texas.
The portion of the South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton lands is approximately 8.3 miles (13.4
km) in length and is depicted on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) North of Tucker Hill, Tex.
(1970) and Tucker Hill, Tex. (1970) 7.5 Minute Quadrangle maps (Figures 2.1-2.4). The construction
corridor consists of a 50 foot (15.24 m) wide permanent pipeline right-of-way (ROW) and an additional 50
foot (15.24 m) wide temporary workspace corridor. The cultural resources survey area of potential effect
(APE) consists of the 8.3 mile (13.4 km) by 100 foot (30 m) corridor, totaling 100.7 acres (40.7 hectares).
Construction of the South Trunk Pipelines will involve the mechanized clearing of vegetation within the
APE and open-cut trenching where the pipelines will be buried. Clearing of vegetation is typically done
with bulldozers. The trenches are typically four to six feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) deep and three to four feet (0.9 to
1.2 m) wide and dug by excavators. State, County, and private roads, including lease roads, are typically
bored under by horizonal directional drilling. Additional impacts within the APE include foot traffic and
general vehicle traffic will range from light-duty pickup trucks to heavy mechanized equipment. Once
construction is complete and the pipeline is operational, all trenches and pits will be backfilled, and all
construction equipment will be removed.
The cultural resources investigation is intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Antiquities Code of Texas
and the cultural resources survey on City of Fort Stockton lands was completed under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 9014. The entire project was supervised by Gary D. Edington, an ENERCON archeologist who
meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth
in 36 CFR 61. No artifacts were collected during the survey. Pursuant to 13 TAC 26.17, notes, records,
photographs, and photograph logs generated during the survey have been prepared for permanent curation
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
Prior to the survey, a search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) was conducted by Michael
M. Margolis to locate previously recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) properties, and State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Based on the Atlas, one
archeological site, 41RV7, has been previously recorded adjacent to the APE. An additional six sites,
41RV2, 41RV5, 41RV50, 41RV67, 41PC447, and 41PC448 have been previously recorded within 1-mile
of the APE. Only two of the sites, 41PC447 and 41PC448, have been previously recorded within 1-mile of
the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands. Only one previous archeological survey or study is mapped within
1-mile of the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands.
The cultural resources survey of the South Trunk Pipelines APE on City of Fort Stockton lands was
conducted January 24-26, 2019 by Cody Kiker and Steven Sykes. Reroutes were surveyed on April 8, 2019
by Cody Kiker and Chris Flowers. Portions of the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands were resurveyed on
August 22 and 23, 2019 by Cody Kiker. Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The APE on City of Fort Stockton lands is situated within the Chihuahuan Basin and Playas biotic province
of the Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). The Chihuahuan Basins and Playas are part of
the larger Chihuahuan Deserts which extend from the Madrean Archipelago of Arizona in the west to the
Edwards Plateau of central Texas. The boundaries of this area are defined by an arid climate with some of
the lowest precipitation rates in Texas, which support desert shrub vegetation dominated by creosote bush
and honey mesquite on the alkaline or gypsiferous soils (Griffith et al. 2007). The elevation of the
Chihuahuan Basins and Playas range from 1,200 to 4,500 feet above mean sea level (amsl) with local relief
varying from 25 to 500 feet (Griffith et al. 2007:10). The major drainages of the approximately 12,625
square mile ecoregion are the Pecos River which carries runoff from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in
northern New Mexico and the Rio Grande which carries runoff from the San Juan Mountains in southern

Page 7

Colorado (Griffith et al. 2007:8-9). Otherwise, the ecoregion is primarily internally drained, resulting in
alkaline soils, but an efficient recharge rate of local aquifers.
The presence of the quality groundwater did not go unnoticed by settlers and early 20th century inhabitants
who made use of the abundant ground water with irrigation well with flow rates between several hundred
to 2000 gallons per minute (Griffith et al. 2007:9). The primary crops on these irrigated agricultural fields
have included cotton, pecans, alfalfa, tomatoes, onions, chili peppers, and the famous melons, particularly
cantaloupe from Reeves County (Griffith el al. 2007; Geiser 2010). The ranching and irrigation based
agricultural practices developed from the late 19th to 20th century in the region have altered the native
environment. In the El Paso area and to the west, aquifer drawdown has led to over a 100 foot decline in
ground water levels from those recorded at the turn of the 20th century and salt build up in soils has led to
the abandonment of many Pecos River Valley agricultural fields which were previously productive
farmlands in the 1900s (Griffith et al. 2007:9). Early settlers and observers described the river as generally
4 to 15 feet deep and up to 100 feet wide with a fast current and fordable in only a few places (Griffith et
al. 2007:9; Hayter 2010). The agricultural and industrial uses of the Pecos River in New Mexico and Texas
have drastically reduced water levels, transforming the Pecos into a gentle, slow river with a shallow,
narrow channel. As an example, the early history of settlement in the region of modern Pecos, Texas was
related to the encampments of cowboys in the region due to the safe ford for cattle across the mighty Pecos
River to the east of the modern town site (Hayter 2010). The historic to modern grazing practices have also
altered the environment in the region. The former grasslands which supported cattle have been reduced by
overgrazing to dessert shrub lands mostly suitable for only sheep and goats (Griffith et al. 2007:8).
The arid climate of the APE results in relatively sparse vegetation and excellent ground surface visibility
(GSV). The dominant creosote bush is an example of the resilient regional flora which can tolerate the
diurnal temperature range, low moisture conditions, and high evapotranspiration rates of the region.
Additional ecotones include the high saline environments of the playas where saltbush and alkali sacaton
may be found along the margins of these dry saltpans and playas (Griffith et al. 2007:8). Honey mesquite,
yucca, and mixed grasses are found intermittently in the region.
The elevation of the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands ranges from approximately 2,840 feet to 3,030
feet (866 to 924 m) amsl. The highest point within the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands is at the southern
edge of the southernmost tract just south of the shorter, lateral pipeline in Pecos County (Figure 2.4). The
lowest point within the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands is at the northern edge of the northernmost tract
one mile south of County Road 20 in Reeves County (Figure 2.1). All of the 8.3 mile (13.4 km) APE on
City of Fort Stockton lands drains internally into a basin west of several agricultural fields and south of US
Highway 285. The APE on City of Fort Stockton lands is underlain by Quaternary Alluvium composed of
sand, silt, clay, and gravel locally indurated with calcium carbonate (caliche) (Barnes et al. 1992).
The soils encountered within the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands are presented alphabetically in Table
1. The soils result from alluvial deposits derived from the decomposition of limestone, gypsum, and igneous
rock. Due to aridity, salinity, alkalinity, and/or shallow depth to bedrock, none of the soils are considered
“prime farmland” (United States Department of Agriculture [USDA] 2019). However, the northern
approximately 4.8 miles (7.7 km) of the APE are within in-use pivot-irrigated agricultural fields and
abandoned concrete flume-irrigated agricultural fields. The shallow, gravelly Upton-Delnorte association
soils are highly unlikely to contain deeply buried cultural deposits. Additionally, the calcium carbonaterich Dalby clay and Reakor soils are unlikely to contain deeply buried cultural deposits. In general, the
degrading topography of the entire area largely precludes the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits.

Reeves County has a subtropical-semi desert climate with relatively short, cool winters and long hot
summers. In winter, the average high temperature is 46°F, with an average low of 29°F. In summer, the
average high temperature is 99°F, with an average low of 83°F (Jaco 1980). The record low in winter is
9°F, recorded on January 11, 1962, and the record high in summer is 118°F, recorded on June 29, 1968
(Jaco 1980). Annual precipitation averages 8.5 inches (22 cm), with 6 (15 cm) of the 8.5 inches (22 cm)
falling from April through September. Thunderstorms occur on an average of 40 days per year (Jaco 1980).
The growing season averages 226 days (Smith 2010). Snowfall is rare, and in 70 percent of winters there
is no measurable snowfall (Jaco 1980). The average humidity ranges from a low of 40 percent in
midafternoon to a high of 70 percent at dawn (Jaco 1980).
Pecos County also has a subtropical-semi desert climate with relatively short winters and long hot summers.
In winter, the average high temperature is 47°F, with an average low of 32°F. In summer, the average high
temperature is 94°F, with an average low of 80°F (Rives 1980). The record low in winter is 4°F, recorded
on January 5, 1972, and the record high in summer is 110°F, recorded on June 22, 1969 (Rives 1980).
Annual precipitation averages 12 inches (30 cm), with 8 (22 cm) of the 12 inches (30 cm) falling from April
through September. Thunderstorms occur on an average of 40 days per year (Rives 1980). The growing
season averages 225 days (Justice and Leffler 2010). Snowfall is rare, and in half of winters there is no
measurable snowfall (Rives 1980). The average humidity ranges from a low of 40 percent in midafternoon
to a high of 70 percent at dawn. The sun shines 80 percent of the time possible in summer and 75 percent
of the time possible in winter (Rives 1980).

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

Based on the archeological record, people have inhabited the region for the last 12,000 years. The
archeological chronology has commonly been broken into five temporal periods. The dates assigned to
those periods differ between authors but generally include the Paleoindian Period (ca. 10,000 to 6,000 B.C.),
Archaic Period (ca. 6,000 B.C. to A.D. 500), Late Prehistoric Period (ca. A.D. 500 to 1500), Protohistoric
Period (ca. A.D. 1500 to 1700), and Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1700 to 1950) (adapted from Boyd 2004,
Perttula 2004, and Raily 2016:54). A summary of the culture history of the region is presented below. For
additional information on the cultural history of the region and a more detailed review, the reader is directed
to the works by Perttula (2004), Railey (2013, 2016), and Turner, Hester, and McReynolds (2011).

Paleoindian Period
Evidence for prehistoric occupation of the area is relatively scarce in the Paleoindian Period (ca. 10,000 to
6,000 B.C.). It is probable that earlier sites have been lost to erosion due to the geological context of the
area (Boyd 1997:7). Paleoindian sites are more common and more reliably dated on the eastern Edwards
Plateau and southern High Plains, although sites and isolated artifacts have been recorded. Although there
is growing evidence for an earlier human presence in the Americas, Clovis is the first well-defined cultural
horizon in the region. The remains of large herbivores are found in association with Clovis artifacts but
there is more recent research supporting the procurement of smaller animals and plants during this time.
The Clovis projectile points are lanceolate in shape and have fluted bases. Subsequent Paleoindian projectile
points include Folsom and Plainview (Turner, Hester, and McReynolds 2011:45). These projectile points
were typically hafted to spears, which were often thrown with the aid of atlatls.
Archaic Period
With the extinction of megafauna, the Archaic Period (ca. 6,000 B.C. to A.D. 500) is generally defined by
broader subsistence practices and an increase in intensity of resource exploitation. The climate transitioned
from the dryer Altithermal in the Early Archaic through the Late Holocene Wet Period to the relatively dry
Late Archaic Medieval Period (Railey 2016:59-83). Additionally, temperatures appear to have increased
which resulted in changes to the biotic community and the subsequent subsistence strategies of the Archaic
Period populations of the region. Fire cracked rock and oxidized rock is relatively common during this
period and likely results from hearths and ovens. Although resource exploitation is inferred to be more
intense, subsistence appears to be focused on seasonal mobility tied in part to bison hunting (Boyd 1997).
Campsites and rock shelters have been identified from this period, mostly from the Late Archaic. Projectile
points are normally barbed spear or dart points, and plant-processing tools increase through time (Johnson
and Holliday 2004). There is an increase in the number of recorded sites in the region attributed to the Late
Archaic in terms of both diagnostic points and radiocarbon dates (Railey 2016:75, 86). The overall inference
is an increase in the population of the region during the Late Archaic (Railey 2016:75).
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric or Ceramic Period (ca. A.D. 500 to 1500) is marked by the presence of ceramics and
smaller projectile points indicating the switch from atlatl and spear to the bow and arrow (Johnson and
Holliday 2004). This period is also known as the Formative Period in the nearby western Trans-Pecos
because of the area’s inclusion within the Jornada Mogollon culture of the greater Southwest archeological
region (Railey 2016: 9). Due to further drying of the climate, bison appear to become scarcer in this region.
Trading is inferred to have occurred with Southwestern groups including the Jornada Mogollon (Boyd
1997). Brownware pottery was imported from the Puebloans and habitation structures from this period
include pit houses. Campsites were still likely used during parts of the year and would be representative of
seasonal mobility. Subsistence practices in the Southern High Plains of the Texas Panhandle to the northeast
included the introduction of maize by A.D. 1000 (Drass 2008), and maize has been found in caves to the
west in the Guadalupe Mountains, and to the south on the Marfa Plain (Railey 2016:99-101, 132). However,
the region continued to be dominated by mobile hunter-gatherers (Railey 2016:132), and regional
subsistence in Reeves and Pecos counties does not include evidence of cultivated resources (Railey 2016:
99-101, 132). In the latter part of the period, prestige goods like Olivella shell beads, turquoise, non-local
pottery, and obsidian become more common.

Protohistoric Period
The Protohistoric Period (ca. A.D. 1500 to 1700) begins with direct and indirect European influences in the
region. This period is also known as the Post-Formative or Post-Pueblo Period in the nearby western TransPecos and New Mexico (Railey 2016:134-140). European settlement did not begin to seriously disrupt
aboriginal habitation until after A.D. 1700. European diseases, probably introduced by explorers and early
traders, did have impacts as early as A.D. 1528. At least 30 epidemics were recorded among Texas tribes
between A.D. 1528 and 1890 (Ewers 1974). Further to the west in the project region Railey defines this era
as the Post-Formative Native Americans (After A.D. 1450). There is widespread abandonment of the
villages and associated lifestyle on the southern High Plains, the Jornada Mogollon and even the Casa
Grandes Region (Railey 2016:134). There is limited evidence of sites dating to the Post Formative Period
in the study region and in Southeast New Mexico (Railey 2016:137). With the abandonment of the village
lifeway, the nomadic bison hunters either did not leave a record that is temporally recognizable via
radiocarbon dating, or material culture that can only be attributed to this era. Railey refers to this as a ‘low
archaeological visibility” problem for sites from the Post-Formative Period (2016:140). Whether
populations totally abandoned the region remains unclear.
Historic Period (A.D. 1700 to 1950)
Spanish explorers began expeditions in the Gulf of Mexico beginning in the early 1500s followed by
Catholic missionaries accompanied by Spanish soldiers. The Spanish, while teaching locals Christianity
and farming, attempted to make loyal Spanish citizens. The first missions were established in Mexico, but
were later built in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas (Campbell 2003:36-38). The French,
partially to stem the advance of the Spanish, wanted to increase their fur trading territory and gain control
of the Mississippi River valley. By 1682, LaSalle, a Frenchman, launched an expedition down the
Mississippi River that claimed all of the lands drained by the river for France followed by a colonization
effort to settle the mouth of the Mississippi River. Subsequent to the French incursion into the region, the
Spanish increased the rate of establishing settlements in Texas (Campbell 2003:41-45, 48).
The Spanish mission system did not expand during the eighteenth century. Native American attacks and a
lack of colonists contributed to the decline of Spanish settlement in Texas. In 1762, the Spanish acquired
Louisiana from the French, which slowed the need to settle east Texas. In 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to
France, who then sold it to the United States. From 1800 to the 1820s, the population of Texas decreased
as a result of the effects of the Mexican Revolution. In 1821, Mexico finally became an independent nation,
separate from Spain. This newly independent country encouraged Anglo-American settlement within
Texas; this effort was led by Stephen F. Austin. Austin came to an agreement with the Mexican government
in which he would bring settlers to Texas and, in return, he would be rewarded with land and money. By
1830, ten thousand Anglo-Americans, mostly from the American southeast, had settled in Texas (Campbell
2003:105-110).
Texas operated as an independent nation for 10 years (1836 to 1846) and during this time, the Mexican
government never truly recognized its independence. In 1846, Texas was annexed by the United States and
it was now up to the U.S. government to settle the border dispute with Mexico. The Mexicans claimed the
international border as the Nueces River, while the U.S. claimed the Rio Grande as the demarcation line.
After two years of skirmishes and an attack on Mexico City, the United States succeeded in its efforts; with
the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Mexico recognized the Rio Grande as the border and ceded the entire
southwest to the Pacific Ocean to the U.S. (McComb 1989:57).
At the time of annexation by the United States, west Texas was relatively unexplored territory, home to
various Native American groups. Settlers began slowly pushing into this territory in the mid-nineteenth
century. In 1848, the U.S. Army stationed troops in west Texas and created travel routes through this new
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton Lands

territory, which would become corridors for pioneers traveling to California. These included the Chihuahua
Trail, which led from Mexico to Indianola, Texas, and Horsehead Crossing and Castle Gap in Crane County,
all of which were utilized as trade networks during the prehistoric period as well as forming part of a historic
transportation corridor linking Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. Castle Gap functioned as a primary route for the
U.S. Cavalry, California Forty-niners, cattle drives, stage coaches, and wagon trains.
During the Civil War, Texas was a large contributor to the Confederacy, but differed significantly from
other southern states. Texas was a frontier state, with a diversified population of Mexicans, AngloAmericans, and Native Americans. The state also had a large European immigrant population, many of
whom were small farmers. Two-thirds of the farmers in the state were non-slave holding, which meant that
the agricultural economy was maintained following the Civil War. In addition, cattle ranches were a large
industry, resulting in economic diversity. Thus, Texas was not as negatively impacted economically as other
southern states during post-Civil War Reconstruction (Campbell 2003:209, 213).
The Native American groups of Texas saw the defeat of the Confederacy and the weakening of Texas as a
chance to regain lands they had lost. During this period, the Comanche and Apache occupied the areas of
west Texas. In response to this increase of Native American attacks, the United States sent troops to
reoccupy several forts. By 1874, a major campaign was initiated in Texas that took away Native Americans’
horses, destroyed their villages, and forced them to return to their reservations. The consolidation of Native
Americans on reservations allowed Anglo-Americans to settle permanently in west Texas (Campbell
2003:291, 295).
Following these campaigns, the military sent troops to conduct detailed expeditions of the former Native
American lands. By 1876, several of the counties northeast of the APE were surveyed by parties from Fort
Concho. Ranchers moved into these areas and began raising large herds of cattle, as the demand for beef
had risen after the Civil War. New cattle trails developed throughout west Texas, where large herds were
driven hundreds of miles north to the mid-western railroad routes. In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway
extended their rail lines through west Texas; up to this point, rail transportation was only available in east
Texas. Between the 1870s and 1890s, 8,000 miles of railway track were laid, connecting the entire state.
The new railroads significantly reduced the time and distance it took the cattle industry to transport their
herds to market (Campbell 2003:297, 306).
The expansion of the railroad connected the rural communities of west Texas with the booming cities to
the east. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, cattle ranchers began to fence off their herds and create
small communities on the frontier. In 1895, a law was passed that broke up these larger ranches, allowing
farmers to purchase smaller tracts of land. This led to the end of open-range ranching and attracted
additional settlers. West Texas communities generally grew slowly due to poor soil conditions and the
difficulty of accessing water. People began to farm corn and cotton on the newly settled land, but ranching
was still the dominant economic activity of west Texas at the end of the nineteenth century.
Reeves County is located in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas and is bordered to the northeast across the
Pecos River by Loving and Ward Counties, to the southeast by Pecos County, to the southwest by Jeff
Davis County, to the west by Culberson County, and along a very narrow 2.5 mile (4.0 km) strip to the
north by Eddy County, New Mexico. Reeves County covers 2,538 square miles (6,573 km2) of primarily
flat to undulating lands, with mountainous areas found in the southern point of the county (Smith 2010).
The Texas and Pacific Railway was constructed through the area in 1881 with railway section houses at
Pecos and Toyah, and in 1883 Reeves County was separated from Pecos County to the southwest, and
Pecos was designated the county seat in 1884 during the formal organization of the county (Smith 2010).
By 1885, the community of Pecos reported 150 residents and the community of Toyah reported 75 residents,
and by 1890, Reeves County had a population of 1,290 persons (Smith 2010). The census of 1900 counted
1,847 residents in the county, with 63 farms being reported totaling 900,000 acres of farmland and 51,000
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton Lands

Page 12

head of cattle (Smith 2010). Intermittent droughts affected the region, as noted above, and the acres of
farmland and size of the cattle herds in the county fluctuated over the next 20 years, but the population had
increased to 4,457 residents (Smith 2010). The discoveries of oil in the county in the 1920s contributed to
the economy, but the large boom experienced in the Hendrick Field to the east did not extend into Reeves
County, and it was not until the 1930s that oil fields in Reeves County brought significant economic and
population growth, and by 1940 the population had increased to 8,006 residents (Smith 2010). The 1950s
discoveries of the of the Toyah Gas Field and the Geraldine-Ford Field were significant in the county, but
again did not compare to the “giant fields” discovered elsewhere in the region. Nevertheless, the population
of the county enumerated in 1960 was 17,644 and had declined to 16,526 residents in 1970, and then to
15,801 residents in 1980. The population decline is intriguing as the area experienced a significant oil boom
in the 1970’s and early 1980s (Smith 2010). The 1990 census listed 15,852 residents, in 2010, 13,783
residents were counted, and the current July 1, 2018 estimated population is at 15,685 residents (Smith
2010b; USCB 2019a). Since inception in 1883, the economy has been based on agriculture and mineral
extraction, with oil and gas development being the primary economic activity over the last nine decades,
while crops have included cotton, hay, wheat, barley and fruits and vegetables such as onions, peppers,
pecans and peaches, and cantaloupes (Smith 2010b, Jaco 1980).
Pecos County is also located in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas and is bordered to the northeast across the
Pecos River by Ward, Crane, and Crockett Counties, to the southeast by Terrell County, to the southwest
by Brewster and Jeff Davis Counties, and to the northwest by Reeves County. Pecos County covers 4,776
square miles (12,370 km2) of primarily flat to undulating lands, with greater elevations found in the southern
and southeastern portions of the county and a relatively small area at the western point of the county (Justice
and Leffler 2010). By 1840, traders were crossing through the area on both the Comanche and Chihuahua
Trails. In 1859, the United States Army established Fort Stockton at Comanche Springs along the trails to
guard the San Antonio–El Paso and Butterfield Overland mail routes as well as trade routes. The town of
St. Gall, named for Peter Gallagher, who purchased the land for the town, was established in 1868 (Justice
and Leffler 2010). Pecos County was established in 1871 by the Texas legislature from part of Presidio
County. The county was formally organized in 1875 at St. Gall, which became the county seat. In the 1880s,
the army decommissioned the fort and St. Gall was renamed Fort Stockton. The closing of the army post
led to an economic downturn and many of the traders and ranchers emigrated from the area. In 1883, the
county lost land to the formation of Reeves and Terrell Counties and in 1885, more land was lost to the
formation of Val Verde County (Justice and Leffler 2010). By 1890, there were only 12 ranches covering
14,564 acres (5,894 hectares), with 227 cattle and 150 sheep. By 1900, the population was 2,360 and there
were 95 ranches covering 2,159,000 acres (873,716 hectares), with 74,000 cattle and 142,000 sheep. By
1910, the population had fallen to 2,071 and the number of ranches and farms had declined to 56, with
109,000 cattle and 61,000 sheep. In 1913, the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway Company of Texas
built a railroad across the county, leading to land speculation and a population boom. By 1920, the
population had risen to 3,058 and there were 207 ranches and farms in the county. Between 1926 and 1990,
over 1.5 billion barrels of crude oil were produced in Pecos County (Justice and Leffler 2010). By 1994,
the population of the county was 15,983 (Justice and Leffler 2010). The 2010 census counted 15,507
residents, and the current July 1, 2018 estimated population is at 15,673 residents (USCB 2019b).

METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources survey followed the THC’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. The APE
was surveyed by using parallel pedestrian transects spaced no more than 50 feet (15 m) apart. The entire
100 foot (30 m) wide APE within the proposed South Trunk Pipelines APE on City of Fort Stockton lands
was subjected to intensive pedestrian survey for cultural resources.

Cultural Resources Report: Proposed South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton Lands

Page 13

Shovel testing density within the survey corridor followed minimum standards outlined by the THC’s and
the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) practices and procedures, which call for 16 shovel tests per
mile is settings which have the potential for buried deposits. Shovel testing is not required in areas with
slopes greater than 20 percent or which do not exhibit potential for buried deposits. Shovel test pits are also
not excavated in areas with standing water or in areas in which underground utilities are present.
Shovel tests generally measure 30 cm in diameter and are excavated by digging to bedrock, a stratigraphic
deposit (e.g. subsoil) that is determined to be below Holocene aged deposits, or to 80-100 cm (dependent
on soil matrix consistency and hardness). All shovel test pit fill is passed through ¼ inch mesh screen or
gone through by hand if the soil will not pass through the screen. Shovel test pits are excavated in arbitrary
10 cm levels unless stratigraphic changes are observed. The cultural resources survey of the 100 foot (30
m) wide APE met the minimum standards outlined by the THC’s and the CTA’s practices and procedures
(13 TAC 26.5 and 26.20).

BACKGROUND RESEARCH

Pre-field background research was conducted to determine if any cultural resources have been previously
recorded within the proposed South Trunk Pipelines APE or within 1-mile of the APE. This research assists
in determining the types of resources in the area and the probability of encountering those resources during
fieldwork Prior to the survey, a search of the Atlas was conducted by Michael M. Margolis to locate
previously recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, NHRP properties, and SALs. One
archeological site, 41RV7, has been previously recorded adjacent to the APE. An additional six sites,
41RV2, 41RV5, 41RV50, 41RV67, 41PC447, and 41PC448 have been previously recorded within 1-mile
of the APE. Only two of the sites, 41PC447 and 41PC448, have been previously recorded within 1-mile of
City of Fort Stockton lands.

Site 41RV2 is a prehistoric rock shelter with rock art. The shelter is approximately 6.5 by 24 feet (2.0 by
7.3 m). The site was recorded by (or based on information supplied by) Donny L. Hamilton in March 1969.
No other information was provided on the site form. The site was not assessed for NRHP eligibility. Site
41RV2 will not be disturbed by construction of the South Trunk Pipelines.
Site 41RV5 is a series of prehistoric open occupation sites with graves along the slopes and tops of mesas
recorded by Donny L. Hamilton in March 1969. Artifacts observed include Harrell, Perdiz, Lerma, and
Toyah arrow points, non-diagnostic bifaces, scrapers, two manos, red ochre, Olivella and mussel shell

beads, a stone pendant, a bone or ivory pendant, and fetish rocks. Graves at the sites include crevice burials
as well as stone-covered surface burials. An unknown number of the graves were excavated either at the
time the site was recorded or prior to recording. Due to their location along the tops and slopes of stonecapped mesas, the sites have been subject to repeated washing and erosion and there is little to no soil depth
at the sites. An abandoned native limestone rock house of Mr. Elkins is located between two of the mesas.
No other information about the stone house is provided on the site form. The site was not assessed for
NRHP eligibility. Site 41RV5 will not be disturbed by construction of the South Trunk Pipelines.
Site 41RV7 is a series of prehistoric open occupation/campsites recorded by Donny L. Hamilton in May
1979. The site consists of low density scattered clusters of artifacts, including fire cracked rock and burned
caliche, chert and quartzite debitage, scrapers, choppers, hammerstones, drills, non-diagnostic bifaces, and
projectile points. Site 41RV7 was revisited by Natural Resources Group in March 2015. During the survey,
two shovel tests were excavated within the site, both of which were negative for buried cultural material.
Based on surficial gravels and shallow depth to caliche bedrock, there is little to no potential for intact
buried cultural deposits. Additionally, the site was estimated to be 25–50% disturbed, most of which is from
the construction of pipelines and facility pad sites. The site was not assessed for NRHP eligibility. However,
avoidance of the site was recommended. Site 41RV7 is located adjacent to the South Trunk Pipelines APE.
Site 41RV50 is a prehistoric open occupation/campsite with petroglyph rock art along the slopes and top
of a mesa recorded by the Center for Big Bend Studies at Sul Ross State University in March 2004. The
mesa-top portion of the site consists of a ring midden of burned rock and well as a scatter of lithics including
two late Archaic dart points (San Pedro and Figueroa), biface preforms, utilized flakes, debitage, and
groundstone. The mesa-slope or mesa-shelf portion of the site consists of hundreds of pecked and carved
petroglyphs found on a level to slightly-sloped limestone shelf below the mesa-top. The petroglyphs are
found both isolated and in clusters. The petroglyphs are both abstract and anthropomorphic, simple and
complex. In addition to the rock art, other portions of the site are exposed on the surface, but there are also
areas of the site with potentially more than three feet (one meter) of sediment, and therefore, the potential
for buried intact cultural deposits. The site is estimated to be 20% disturbed and subject to artifact collecting.
The site form states that the site has potential to be both a SAL and for listing to the NRHP. Site 41RV50
will not be disturbed by construction of the South Trunk Pipelines.
Site 41RV67 is a prehistoric open occupation/campsite recorded by the Natural Resource Group in March
2015. The site consists of a very low density scatter of six flakes and an unmodified stone with fossils. At
least one shovel test was excavated within the site and was negative for buried cultural resources. The site
was determined to have very little research value and the site is recommended as not eligible for listing to
the NRHP and no further work is recommended. Site 41RV67 will not be disturbed by construction of the
South Trunk Pipelines.
Sites 41PC447 and 41PC448 were recorded by SB Houston in June 1991 during the cultural resources
survey for West Texas Utility Transmission Lines. However, site forms were never submitted to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, which maintains the Atlas, and therefore there is no further information
on these two sites.
No other sites have been previously recorded within 1-mile of the APE. Based on the Atlas, there is one
additional project mapped within 1-mile of the APE. The Delaware Basin NGL Pipeline crosses the
proposed South Trunk Pipelines north of Toyah Lake, less than 1-mile from the north end of the APE and
approximately 20 miles (32 km) north of the City of Fort Stockton lands.
Overall background research of the region suggests that the APE is located within a larger area where
climatic conditions, burrowing rodents, and the effects of ranching and oil and gas exploration have each
effected the cultural landscape leading to two types of general settings. Wind erosion and extensive
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton Lands

bioturbation from rodent burrowing, and sheep and cattle grazing have exposed the upper surface of the
landscape within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas. With the exception of a few geomorphological
locations, archeological sites of all ages may be located on the exposed ground surface and/or were never
buried (Hall 2006:2-7). The majority of archeological sites are located on eroded surfaces and therefore
lack vertical integrity and stratigraphy (Hall 2006:2-15). While intact archeological deposits may be
encountered where depositional processes, such as (a) colluvial; (b) eolian sand deposits associated with
the playa margins; (c) upland playa and lake fill deposits; and (d) within and adjacent to extant and/or
extinct draws and/or drainages of Late-Pleistocene to early Holocene age (Hall 2006:2-7, 2-11; Johnson
and Holliday 2004:285, 290, 294). The APE on City of Fort Stockton lands is located within the areas of
eroded and exposed surfaces, and sites would be expected to be resting on the surface, or ephemerally
exposed by shifting sand dunes.

RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the South Trunk Pipelines APE on City of Fort Stockton lands was
conducted January 24–26, 2019 by Cody Kiker and Steven Sykes. Reroutes were surveyed on April 8, 2019
by Cody Kiker and Chris Flowers. Following comments by the THC, portions of the APE on City of Fort
Stockton lands were resurveyed on August 22 and 23, 2019 by Cody Kiker. All aspects of the project were
supervised by Gary D. Edington, an ENERCON archeologist who meets U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s
Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61. Fieldwork was conducted in
accordance with the THC Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. The cultural resources survey APE
on City of Fort Stockton lands consists of the 8.3 mile (13.4 km) by 100 foot (30 m) corridor, totaling 100.7
acres (40.7 hectares).
The nine tracts of City of Fort Stockton land are organized into two blocks: a larger, northern block
composed of six tracts in Reeves and Pecos Counties and a smaller, southern block composed of three tracts
in Pecos County. Within the larger, northern block, the four northernmost tracts contain current and/or
historically-irrigated agricultural fields, one tract contains both a historically-irrigated agricultural field and
non-irrigated grazing land, and the southernmost tract contains only non-irrigated grazing land. The smaller,
southern block contains only non-irrigated grazing land.
In January, the weather was cold, often near freezing in the morning, but becoming warmer and drier by
the afternoon. In April, the weather was warm and dry in the morning, becoming hotter and drier in the
afternoon. In August, the weather was hot and dry. Skies were generally clear and sunny with light to
moderate variable winds. Terrain within the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands is very gently sloped up
from north to south (Figures 2.1-2.4). Soils within the APE on City of Fort Stockton were generally silty to
sandy, with calcic soils, caliche and limestone gravels exposed from erosion of the underlying bedrock, and
surficial quartzite, chert, rhyolite, basalt and other volcanic gravels eroded and transported from the Barrilla
Mountains southwest of the APE (Figures 3-10). Vegetation was dominated by creosote bush, tarbush,
locust, and honey mesquite, as well as scattered, patchy grasses. Other common, but less abundant
vegetation included saltbush, althorn, and alkali sacaton (Figures 3-10). GSV throughout the APE averaged
80 percent, and was generally almost 100 percent (Figures 3, 4, 7-10) except for an approximately 3,300
foot (1,006 m) long portion of the APE within a fallow, center pivot irrigated agricultural field straddling
the Reeves-Pecos County line with some small, patchy areas of denser grasses where GSV varied from 40
to 80 percent (Figures 5 and 6). These grasses were somewhat thicker as they grew up and out, but were
still generally sparse with thin stems near the ground surface, increasing visibility.
The APE on City of Fort Stockton lands has been subject to multiple ground disturbing activities, including
cultivation, livestock grazing, transmission line construction and maintenance and oilfield disturbances,

including pipeline construction and maintenance, well pad construction and maintenance, and lease road
construction and maintenance as well as bioturbation by pack rats, ground squirrels, and other animals.
No portion of the APE in the smaller, southern block of City of Fort Stockton tracts is closer than 1,650
feet (503 m) from a natural water source and no portion of the APE in the larger, northern block of City of
Fort Stockton tracts is closer than 4,600 feet (1,402 m) from a natural water source.
Due to distance from natural water sources, shallow soils, generally moderate to high levels of surficial
gravels, disturbances by oilfield and cultivation activities, and bioturbation, the soils within the APE on
City of Fort Stockton lands were determined to possess limited potential to contain buried cultural deposits.
As a result, no shovel tests were excavated within the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands.

The cultural resources survey of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines APE on City of Fort Stockton lands
resulted in the recording of four archeological sites, from north to south, 41RV201, 41PC934, 41PC937,
and 41PC935.
Sites 41RV201 and 41PC934
Site 41RV201 contains three limited portions of typically one mile (1.61 km) long, west to east-oriented
PIPFC irrigation flumes (Figures 11-16, Appendix A: Figure 1, Appendix B). Site 41PC934 contains four
limited portions of typically one mile (1.61 km) long, west to east-oriented PIPFC irrigation flumes (Figures
17-23, Appendix A: Figures 2 and 3, Appendix B). All seven PIPFC irrigation flume portions in sites
41RV201 and 41PC934 are partially buried and have nearly identical dimensions. The flumes are 72 inches
(183 cm) across from edge to edge at the top of the channel, 12 inches (30 cm) across from edge to edge at
the bottom of the channel, and 27 inches (69 cm) deep from top to bottom of the channel. The thickness of
the concrete varies from four inches (10 cm) at the top, outer edges of the flume to two inches (5 cm) at the
sloped sides of the flume. The base of all flumes was buried and unable to be excavated due to the
continuous nature of the flumes and so the thickness of the concrete at the base of the flumes is unknown.
Each flume is located approximately 0.5 mile (0.8 km) north and south of the next flume. The flumes are
no longer in use and in a state of disrepair such that they could not be used as they are no longer watertight. Multiple flumes have sections of concrete that are cracked, broken, and fallen over, or portions have
been bulldozed or otherwise destroyed. None of the wells or short feeder flumes connecting the wells to the
long west to east-oriented flumes are located within the proposed South Trunk Pipelines APE. However,
two of the wells and feeder flumes were located nearby outside of the APE. The short feeder flumes are
also cracked, broken, and no longer connected to the wells or longer field flumes. The wells lack pumps
and are not in use, although modern electrical control boxes and duct-taped PVC pipes are present in the
vicinity of the open casing wellheads. The wells are visible on the 1970 USGS topographic maps,
suggesting the current hardware and pipes are replacements and not original.
No other artifacts or features were observed in association with the concrete irrigation flumes. GSV was
extremely good in the vicinity of the flumes, averaging 80 percent on the south side of the flume and nearly
100 percent on the north side of the flume. Caliche, chert, rhyolite and other gravels were common on the
surface in the vicinity of the flumes (Figures 11-23). Like the rest of the APE on City of Fort Stockton
lands, soils in the area of the sites are relatively shallow, generally grading to clay or clay loam with caliche
within five to seven inches (13 to 18 cm). In addition to natural disturbances including erosion and
bioturbation by burrowing animals as well as artificial disturbances from oil field activities, the area has
also been disturbed by several decades of cultivation. The combination of these effects as well as surficial
caliche and other gravels suggests a low potential for intact buried cultural deposits, and therefore no shovel
tests were excavated at sites 41RV201 and 41PC934.
Archival research on the specific concrete irrigation flumes within the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands
did not provide additional information on them. Research at the West of the Pecos Museum and Reeves
County Library in Pecos, Texas and the Annie Riggs Memorial Museum in Fort Stockton, Texas as well as
multiple rural water districts in Reeves and Pecos Counties failed to provide meaningful information on
construction or abandonment dates, design and engineering, or original ownership. Most records relating
to irrigation deal with surface water irrigation systems, including earthen ditches, dams, and canal systems
constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and connected to the Pecos River or Toyah Creek in
Reeves County or Comanche Creek in Pecos County (Taylor 1902). According to Longenecker et al, the
Pecos Pump [Groundwater] Irrigation Area is located nearby to the north, in Pecos County, south and
southeast of the town of Pecos (1963:4). However, the irrigation area does not extend to the Reeves-Pecos
county line or into Pecos County (Longenecker et al. 1963:4). The irrigation flumes at sites 41RV201 and
41PC934 are likely part of a different irrigation area or system, or they may have been added to the Pecos
Pump Irrigation Area after 1963.
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton Lands

Page 22

By the mid-20th century, groundwater irrigation systems were replacing older surface water irrigation
systems. Surface water irrigation systems were less reliable: they relied on rainfall and were affected by
upstream water use (Hughes 1978). In fact, there are accounts of water rights disputes being settled by the
mysterious death or disappearance of one party or the forced removal of dams (Hughes 1978: 100).
Additionally, the ditches, canals, and dams were prone to being washed out by floods, as happened in 1904
in Barstow, a few miles east of Pecos, devastating the area (Hughes 1978: 107). Wells with mechanized
pumps were more reliable and the concrete irrigation flumes at sites 41RV201 and 41PC934 were likely
built between 1940 and 1950, when Reeves and Pecos Counties saw a jump from less than one percent
irrigated land to greater than 25 percent irrigated land (Gutman and Sample 1995: 156). Others note that
mechanical innovations lead to a general increase in irrigation agriculture throughout all of Texas after
World War II (Dethloff and Nall 2010). The first center-pivot irrigation system was patented on July 22,
1952, but by 1954 only a few systems had been sold because the early models were difficult to operate and
needed improvements (Alfred 2011). Systems became more reliable and economical in the late 1950s and
into the 1960s after the original inventor sold the patent to Valley Manufacturing (Alfred 2011). According
to the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), Pecos and Reeves Counties were thriving irrigated areas
until 1976-77, when rising fuel costs for multiple groundwater pumps made irrigation cost-prohibitive.
“Now there are many acres of idle cropland, empty concrete-lined irrigation canals, wells with pump motors
removed, and vacant cotton gins.” (TWDB 1986: 26). Additionally, “some producers are switching from
graded furrow method to center pivot, low pressure systems to save on labor and energy costs” (TWDB
1986: 26). Between 1969 and 1978, Reeves and Pecos Counties saw a drop from 5 to 25 percent irrigated
land to less than one percent irrigated land (Gutman and Sample 1995: 157). Of the 4.5 square miles of City
of Fort Stockton land that were formerly watered by the concrete irrigation flumes, less than two square
miles are watered by modern center pivot irrigation. The remaining land is no longer irrigated or in
cultivation.

Sites 41PC937 and 41PC935
Site 41PC937 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located in an abandoned agricultural field adjacent to the
southernmost PIPFC irrigation flume of site 41PC934 (Figures 24-29, Appendix A: Figure 3, Appendix B).
Site 41PC937 consists of multiple chert artifacts, including one primary flake, 10 secondary flakes, and
seven tertiary flakes (Figures 24-29) and measures approximately 75 feet (23 m) by 75 feet (23 m). No
evidence of intact cultural deposits, features, cultural lenses, diagnostic artifacts, or additional cultural
materials were observed at the site.
Site 41PC935 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located in non-irrigated grazing land south of the abandoned
agricultural fields (Figures 30-32, Appendix A: Figure 3, Appendix B). Site 41PC935 consists of multiple
chert artifacts, including one non-diagnostic biface, one unifacial core, two primary flakes, five secondary
flakes, and one tertiary flake (Figures 31 and 32) and measures approximately 120 feet (37 m) north to
south by 50 feet (15 m) east to west. No evidence of intact cultural deposits, features, cultural lenses,
diagnostic artifacts, or additional cultural materials were observed at the site.

Isolated Finds
The cultural resources survey of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines APE on City of Fort Stockton lands
also resulted in the observation of 18 isolated finds (IF) (Appendix A: Figures 1-5). These IFs, #17-20, 2330, 32-34, and 39-41, are described in Table 3. None of the 18 IFs observed are diagnostic, and the majority
consist of isolated chert flakes.

Photos of the majority of IFs are not included in this report. The majority of IFs are non-diagnostic lithic
debitage made from locally available materials, and photos would provide little to no additional information
beyond what is included in Table 3. IF #18 is only IF with rhyolite material (Figure 33). IF #29 is the only
IF with lithic tools, however, they are non-diagnostic (Figures 34 and 35). The wellhead at IF #40 is shown
in Figure 36.
The cultural resources survey of the South Trunk Pipelines APE on City of Fort Stockton lands did not
result in finding any additional historic or prehistoric artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites.

RECOMMENDATIONS

ENERCON, in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
for the proposed South Trunk Pipelines. The proposed project consists of two 8-inch crude oil pipelines and
an 8-inch gas pipeline, all of which are located south of Pecos, Texas and west of Fort Stockton, Texas in
Reeves and Pecos Counties, Texas. This report encompasses only the portion of the proposed South Trunk
Pipelines located on nine tracts of City of Fort Stockton lands in Reeves and Pecos Counties. Texas. The
City of Fort Stockton is a political subdivision of the State of Texas. The portion of the South Trunk
Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton lands is approximately 8.3 miles (13.4 km) in length and is depicted on
the USGS North of Tucker Hill, Tex. (1970) and Tucker Hill, Tex. (1970) 7.5 Minute Quadrangle maps.
The construction corridor consists of a 50 foot (15.24 m) wide permanent pipeline ROW and an additional
50 foot (15.24 m) wide temporary workspace corridor. The cultural resources survey APE consists of the
8.3 mile (13.4 km) by 100 foot (30 m) corridor, totaling 100.7 acres (40.7 hectares).
The cultural resources investigation is intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Antiquities Code of Texas
and the cultural resources survey on City of Fort Stockton lands was completed under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 9014. The entire project was supervised by Gary D. Edington, an ENERCON archeologist who
meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth
in 36 CFR 61.
Prior to the survey, a search of the Atlas was conducted by Michael M. Margolis to locate previously
recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, NRHP properties, and SALs. Based on the Atlas, one
archeological site, 41RV7, has been previously recorded adjacent to the APE. An additional six sites,
41RV2, 41RV5, 41RV50, 41RV67, 41PC447, and 41PC448 have been previously recorded within 1-mile
of the APE. Only two of the sites, 41PC447 and 41PC448, have been previously recorded within 1-mile of
the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands. Only one archeological survey or study is mapped within 1-mile
of the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands.
The cultural resources survey of the South Trunk Pipelines APE on City of Fort Stockton lands was
conducted January 24-26, 2019 by Cody Kiker and Steven Sykes. Reroutes were surveyed on April 8, 2019
by Cody Kiker and Chris Flowers. Portions of the APE on City of Fort Stockton lands were resurveyed on
August 22 and 23, 2019 by Cody Kiker. Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the THC
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
The cultural resources survey of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines resulted in the recording of four
archeological sites. 41RV201 consists of portions of three PIPFC irrigation flumes. Site 41PC934 consists
of portions of four similar PIPFC irrigation flumes. The flumes extend east and west outside of the ROW,
but only the portion within the ROW is included in the site. The flumes are abandoned and no longer
functional as they have cracked or broken or been demolished and disconnected from water sources. These
concrete flumes were built in the late 1940s to 1950s as technologies improved and more materials became
available for groundwater pumps after World War II. With the exception of two one-square mile center
pivot-irrigated agricultural fields, the fields formerly watered by the irrigation flumes are no longer in
cultivation. No evidence of intact cultural deposits, additional features, cultural lenses, or additional cultural
materials were observed at the three irrigation flumes within 41RV201 or the four irrigation flumes within
41PC934. Site 41PC937 is a small lithic scatter consisting of chert debitage located adjacent to the
southernmost concrete flume within site 41PC934. Site 41PC935 is another small lithic scatter consisting
of chert debitage. No evidence of diagnostic artifacts, intact cultural deposits, features, cultural lenses, or
additional cultural materials were observed at sites 41PC937 or 41PC935. Ground surface visibility was
nearly 100 percent at all four sites. Due to surficial gravels, cobbles, and caliche, as well as generally
shallow soils grading to caliche, there is limited potential for intact buried cultural deposits at the four sites.
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton Lands

Page 38

The condition of the irrigation flumes at sites 41RV201 and 41PC934 demonstrates an overall lack of
integrity. Disturbances from cultivation at site 41PC937 have also negatively impacted integrity at the site.
Due to the lack of additional information potential, sites 41RV201, 41PC934, 41PC937, and 41PC935 are
recommended as not eligible for listing on the NRHP or designation as a SAL, and no further cultural
resources investigations are recommended.
The cultural resources survey of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines APE on City of Fort Stockton lands
also resulted in the observation of 18 IFs. None of the 18 IFs observed are diagnostic, and the majority
consist of isolated chert flakes. The 18 IFs lack additional information potential and are therefore not
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or SAL listings.
The cultural resources survey of the South Trunk Pipelines APE did not result in finding any additional
historic or prehistoric artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites and no artifacts were collected on City of
Fort Stockton lands. Therefore, it is recommended that construction of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines
on City of Fort Stockton lands will have no effect on any historic property that may qualify for inclusion
on the NRHP or SAL listings. No further cultural resources investigations are recommended prior to
construction of the proposed South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton lands. If cultural material,
including sites, features, or artifacts that are 50 years old or older are encountered within the APE during
construction of the South Trunk Pipelines on City of Fort Stockton lands, work in the area must cease and
the regional THC Archeologist must be notified immediately.
