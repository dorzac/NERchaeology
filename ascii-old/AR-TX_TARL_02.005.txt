Illustrations: The illustrated ceramic vessels are Titus phase carinated bowls in the
collections of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin. The drawings were
prepared by Don L. Herron, also of Austin. The Ripley Engraved pendant triangle motif
on the front cover is from 41TI7 (Russell Brothers Farm) in the Big Cypress Creek
subcluster, and its intrasite provenience is unknown. Depicted on the dedication page is
a Ripley Engraved scroll motif carinated bowl from 41FK5 (Bruce J. Connally Farm), in
the Three Basins subcluster.

This review and analysis of the recorded archeological
sites in the Cypress Creek basin of northeast Texas and
northwest Louisiana was prepared as a master's thesis in 1981
(Thurmond 1981) • Since that time, it has been ut il ized by
archeologists working in the northeast Texas area as an easy­
to-use compendium of information on both the known archeolog­
ical resources and the history of archeological investigation
in the Cypress basin.

Given the original purpose of the study, only twenty
copies were printed in 1981. Most of these were distributed
to university libraries in Oklahoma and Texas. With my per­
mission, the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of
Reclamation printed an additional fifty copies in 1983, and
distributed them to their own staff members and those of the
U.s. Army Corps of Engineers in need of the information.
In order to make the Cypress basin study more readily
available to the archeological community, this 1990 edition
has been reprinted by The University of Texas at Austin,
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. The original type­
written manuscript was scanned by the UT computation Center
using a Kurzweil 4000 scanner, and was converted to an ASCII
file on disc. Using the Wordstar 5.5 Professional word proc­
essing program, the author then edited and reformatted the
manuscript to its present form.
The data presented by the study have been selectively
updated. A cOllf>rehens ive update to incorporate the data from
all sites recorded within the study area since 1981 was
deemed impractical and unnecessary. No major survey projects
have been performed in the Cypress basin during the 1980s,
and most of the site information added since 1981 has been
simple locational data, too limited in nature to be of sig­
nificant interpretive vaLue. I have therefore used my own
judgment in updating the ~resentations of specific sites
within the Cypress basin for which significant new data have
become availabLe.
specifically, the presentations of the following sites
have been updated: 41MR2, the WheLan Estate site; 41TT4, A.P.
Williams Farm; 41TT12, L.A. Hale Farm; 41TT13, the Alex
Justiss site; 411T108, the Tankersley Creek site; and
41TT110, the Benson's Crossing site. Two new sites have been
added: 41MR62, the Forrest Murphey site, a site on Lake O'
The Pines which apparently had both CLovis and late Paleoin­
dian components; and 41TT310, a muLticomponent site on Lake
Bob Sandl in.
The suggested calendric timespans of the Caddoan periods
and phases presented in Table 8 have been shifted back a
century, reflecting recent interpretations of the route of
the De Soto expedition by Charles Hudson and Frank Schambach
that suggest Spanish contact with the Cypress cluster during
the Titus phase in 1542, and the fairly rapid depopulation of
the western Cypress basin thereafter, probably as the result
of epidemic disease.
The period referred to in the 1981 version of this study
as "Transitional Early to Late Caddoan" has been renamed the
"Middle Caddoan period" in harmony with current usage by

Caddoan area archeologists. Likewise, sites referred to in
1981 as "Transitional Whelen phase to Titus phase" are herein
termed "late Whelan phase" following Susan Lisk (1984). The
discussion of the Titus phase subclusters in Section 7.3.4
has been rewritten to conform with the version published in
the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society (Thurmond
1983) •

To the following individuals, I express my appreciation
for their guidance and advice at various points during the
course of this study. Ross Fields and Jim Hester made sub­
stantial contributions to the organization of the data col­
lection process at its inception. Jim Neely and Mott Davis
offered much useful advice and criticism during the course of
the writing. Jack Jackson provided his expertise in the
identification of the mold-made ceramic pipes in certain of
the Cypress basin collections. Kerza Prewitt, Rick Watson and
Bruce Wilson advised me on techniques of drafting and repro­
duction. Darrell Creel significantly influenced my use of the
available radiocarbon dates from the Cypress basin.

Carolyn Spock of the Texas Archeological Research Labo­
ratory has been instrumental in arranging and facilitating
the publication of this study. Her considerable efforts to
this end are gratefully acknowledged. I likewise express my
appreciation to Carolyn and to Dee Ann Story for their help
in editing and proofreading. Figure 35 was redrafted by
Others made important contributions of data and logisti­
Sandra L. Hannum of Austin, and Figures 28-33, 36 and 37 were cal support. LaVerne Herrington granted me free access to the

provided assistance in the conservation of certain iron
artifacts in the TARL collections. Milton Bell and Joe Denton
provided access to the specimens from Cypress basin sites in
the archeological collections of the Texas Department of
Pete Thurmond
Highways and Public Transportation. Bill Drlsgers shared the
Deceri>er I 1989

The present population of the Cypress basin is approxi­
mately 150,000, with 35% living in urban areas and 65% in
rural areas (Arbingast et al. 1973: 130-132). The city of
Shreveport occupies the far southeastern corner of the basin,
and numerous smaller communities are scattered across the
basin's remainder, particularly in its northwest quadrant.
Roughly 40% of the basin is presently under forest. The
remaining 60% is occupied by, in decreasing order of areal
importance, pastureland, reservoirs, cultivated land, urban
areas and industrial or mining operations. The primary
sources of employment in the area at the present time are
forestry, livestock husbandry, oil/gas production, coal
mining and electricity generation, and heavy industry
(steel).
1.3 Summary of Organization and Content
The organization of this study is relatively simpLe.
Chapters 2·4 provide background information necessary to an
interpretation of the data base. In Chapter 2, the natural
environment of the Cypress basin is summarized with two
objectives in mind: 1) to familiarize the reader with the
general character of the environment from an archeological
point of view; and 2) to examine the groundwater hydrology of
the basin in some detail. The latter is relevant to the
distribution of archeological sites, in that reliable water
supplies can be found in the form of springs far from any
major watercourse in many parts of the basin. Chapter 3
relates the history of archeological investigation in the
Cypress basin, emphasizing methodoLogical strengths and
weaknesses and the character of data produced by each insti­
tution or individual. The data resources exploited by the
present study and the methods of data coLlection are de­
scribed in detail in Chapter 4.

CHAPTER 2
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE CYPRESS BASIN
2.1

Introduction

The present study does not follow an explicitly environ­
mental approach, relating site locations to specific mi­
croenvironments in an attempt to deduce prehistoric subsist­
ence strategies. Rather, its primary emphases are culture
history and the more general distribution of components of
different time periods and (where possible to identify)
different social groups across the topographic and hydrologic
landscape. Therefore, most of the information presented in
this chapter is quite brief and generaLized, and is intended
to serve only to familiarize the reader with the basic char­
acter of the modern natural environment of the basin. The
provision of more detailed information is largely limited to
those areas which bear upon the hydrology of the basin, as I
wish to address its potentiaL effects upon aboriginal site
distributions.
2.2 Cl imate

The Cypress basin is characterized by a relatively mild
climate. The mean annual temperature ranges from 18 to 19
degrees C across the basin (Arbingast et al. 1973: 15), and
the mean monthly temperature varies from 8 degrees C in
January to 28 degrees C in August (Chandler and Beffort 1973:
5). The mean maxfnun July temperature is 35 degrees C, and
the mean mfninun January temperature is 2 degrees C (Mahler
1973: 3). Diurnal variation in temperature is seldom greater
than 10 degrees C. The first freeze in winter usually occurs
in mid-November, and the last freeze in mid-March, providing
a safe growing season of roughly 230 days (Arbingast et al.
1973: 18-19). The growing season is therefore optimal for
most cultigens, with a sufficiently long frost-free period to

along the valley margins.
The occurrence of Paleoindian components on the flood­
plain landforms of east Texas streams outside the Cypress
basin suggests that most of the valleys of the region have
been relatively stable (barring lateral channel migration) at
least since late Pleistocene times. At the Doering site in
the Addicks Dam Reservoir basin (Yheat 1953: 175, 205), one

from a floodplain rise bordering a stream of similar order to

Yarbrough site on the upper Sabine River, Johnson (1962: 180­
183, Fig. 8) found two Clovis, one Plainview, two San Pa­
trice, three Meserve/DaLton and ten other Paleoindian projec­
tile points on a floodpLain rise.
There are in fact very few contexts in which rapid
deposition occurs in this environment. Upland surfaces are
either slowly eroding or stable. Terraces and floodplain
rises are stable or very slowly aggrading, and most flood­
plain floors aggrade at a slow rate. The deepest excavated
archeological site in the Cypress basin was Benson's Crossing
(41TT110), a terrace site in the northwest part of the basin,
where 10,000 years of occupational debris extended less than
two meters below the surface. ArcheoLogical sites with
sealed, stratified cultural deposits are rare in most of
northeast Texas. Typically, the debris of multiple components
is mixed together in a deposit of no more than 50 to 100 em
in depth, and the subsurface distribution of artifacts and
associated materials at such sites is probably seldom at­
tributable to depositional processes. As noted above, archeo­
logical sites tend to occur on sandy soils, which also happen
to be the preferred habitat of the plains pocket gopher
(~ bursarius), and various other burrowing animals.
It
seems highly likely that much of the subsurface distribution
of artifacts in northeast Texas is the result of bioturbes­
cence-related downward displacement (cf. Brown 1975a, Hofman
1986). However, deep stratified sites have been documented
along Big Sandy Creek to the immediate southwest of the
Cypress basin (Perttula et al. 1986), and may occur elsewhere
in areas of massive unconsolidated sand deposits.
2.4 Geology and Soils
The geologic units outcropping in the Cypress basin can
be divided into two major outcrop groups, upland and valley.
Exposed on the slowly eroding slopes of the uplands are
sedimentary clastics of the Paleocene Midway group and the
Eocene Yilcox and Claiborne groups. The Midway and Wilcox
groups have not been subdivided into formations in this area,
but the Claiborne group is separated into five formations (in
reverse stratigraphic order): the Carrizo, Reklaw, Queen
City, Yeches and Sparta formations. As noted in Section 2.3,

Treatments of the lithology and soils of the basin are
combined in this section because variation in the character
of parent material tends to be the most important pedogenic
variable in the region. The geologic units outcropping in
the basin are mapped in Figure 2. Pleistocene terraces and
Holocene floodplain alluvium are mapped as a single unit
because terraces in the western part of the basin are gener­
ally too small to map on the relevant scale, and no accurate
information as to their distribution was available for Caddo
Parish or Miller County. Table 1 describes the composition,
color, depth, hydrological characteristics, potential for
aboriginal raw material procurement and soils associations of
each geological unit, in stratigraphic order. All soil clas­
sifications used in this study follow the U.S. Department of
Agriculture Seventh Approximation (Soil Survey Staff 1975).
The geologic structure underlying the Cypress basin is illus­
trated in Figure 3, a structural contour map of the contact
between the Midway and Yilcox groups. The relationship be­
tween the geologic structure and outcrop lithology is summa­
rized in Section 2.4.1, and Section 2.4.2 discusses the soils
of the study area and their archeological significance.
2.4.1

The reader will undoubtedly note, in studying Figure 2,
the symmetry of the outcrop lithology. The Queen City forma­
tion occupies the center of the basin, with Sparta and Wilcox
formation remnants scattered through the central and north­
east sections of its outcrop area. To either side, outcrops
of the Reklaw and Carrizo formations successively occur. This
outcrop symmetry is the product of a major synclinal struc­
ture which underlies the Cypress basin, the East Texas embay­
ment (Fig. 3). At the time of their deposition, the Tertiary
units outcropping in the basin dipped to the southeast. Such
is still the case in the northwest part of the basin, but
subsequent uplift to the southeast, termed the Sabine Uplift.
has created a broad structural basin which crosses the study
area on a southwest to northeast axis. Thus, the Tertiary
units have been gently folded, and erosion has exposed out­
crops of each on either side of the basin.
Several lesser structural features should be briefly
noted. The floor of the East Texas embayment is not level,
and several subsidiary structural basins occur within the
study area: the Avinger, Linden and Ida basins (Fig. 3). The
general pattern of embayment and uplift in the eastern half
of the Cypress basin has been disrupted by the Rodessa fault
zone, which crosses under Big Cypress Bayou in the vicinity
of Jefferson, trending northeast. The geologic units have
been downthrown 30 to 60 meters on the south side of the
fault (Broom 1971: 6). In the western end of the basin, a
minor structural ridge termed the Kelsey anticline has dis­
rupted the northwest side of the East Texas embayment, bring­
ing the Carrizo and Reklaw formations to the surface west and
northwest of Gilmer. No evidence of faulting is discernible
at the surface along the anticline (Smith et al. 1966: 5).
Its uplift has elevated the topographic relief, and there is
a high occurrence of springs in its vicinity (Fig. 4).

TABLE 1. GEOLOGIC UNITS OUTCROPPING IN THE CYPRESS BASIN
Quaternary Alluvium
Alluvial deposits of both the modern floodplains and Pleistocene terrace remnants are jointly considered here. The flood·
plains are largely composed of unconsolidated clay and silt, but isolated lenses of sand and gravel occur in buried channel
fill and levees. At the surface, localized sandy knolls occur as levees along modern and abandoned channels, and as isolated
terrace remnants scattered across the floodplain. Terrace remnants along the valley margins also tend to have a higher sand
content than the modern floodplain floor alluvium, suggest;ng that a more xer;c climate may have obtained during the Pleisto­
cene. The alluvium tends to be pale brown in the Cypress basin proper, and reddish brown along the Red River. Valley fill
depth ranges from 10 meters in the western Cypress basin to 25 meters or more in the east. The areal extent of the alluvial
deposits increases eastward with stream magnitude (Fig. 2). Seep springs of limited and intermittent discharge often occur at
the bases of the streamside scarps of valley margin terrace remnants. small cobbles of low grade cherts and orthoquartzites
can be found in tow density concentrations at the bases of terrace scarps and along modern stream channels, and fine textured
alluvial deposits offer clays suitable for use in ceramic manufacture. The soils on the terraces are commonly typic dystro­
chrepts or typic paleudalfs, while typic udipsamments occur on the sandy floodplain rises and the floodplain floor;s occu­
pied by typic udifluvents and aquic udifluvents.
Sparta Formation ~ Sand)
The formation is primarily composed of fine- to medium- grained quartz sand, with a limited admixture of silt and clay.
lenses of sandy clay occur, increasing upward through the unit in frequency. An indurated, dark brown ferruginous sandstone
forms the base of the unit. The overlying beds weather to a light gray or red. The depth of the Sparta formation in the
Cypress basin never exceeds 15 meters, and it occurs only as small, irregularly shaped erosional remnants at the highest
elevations in the central and northeast parts of the basin (Fig. 2). Gravity springs occasionalLy occur along the contact
with the underlying Weches formation, but their discharge is quite limited and intermittent. The Sparta formation is not
hydraulically connected to any other unit, and the small size of the outcrops severely limits recharge. The ferruginous
sandstone at the base of the formation is sufficiently indurated for use in ground stone tool manufacture. OUtcrops of the
unit are commonly associated with srenic paleudults and typic paleudults.
Weches Formation
Glauconite, quartz sand and clay alternate in thin beds which are locally cross·bedded to lenticular. The entire formation
tends to be quite resistant to erosion due to cementation by glauconite, limonite and siderite, forming prominent scarps
along ridgecrests and hilltops. Outcrops of the Weches formation co-occur with those of the Sparta formation, and the resist­
ance of the former is largely responsible for the survival of the latter. The Weches formation typically outcrops in a narrow
band around the perimeter of each of the remnants mapped in Figure 2, with the overlying Sparta formation occupying the
greater part of the surface exposure of each such remnant. The glauconitic beds weather to a grayish green, and the clay beds
to a dark reddish brown. Thickness of the unit ranges from 3 to 15 meters, thinning eastward. The formation is relatively
iq>ermeable, and functions as an aquaclude for both the overlying Sparta formation and the underlying Queen City formation.
Springs are thus known to occur at both its upper (gravity) and lower (artesian) margins. The green and brown pigments which
occur so frequently in Caddoan graves in the Cypress basin may have been procured in part from Weches formation outcrops.
Typic paleudults, typic udorthents and lithic udorthents have formed on outcrops of this unit.
Queen City Formation (Queen City Sand)
Thin beds of gray to brown silty clay and greenish gray glauconitic quartz sand alternate with more massive beds of argilla'
ceous quartz sand, the latter weathering to a light gray or brown. The clay and glauconite beds tend to increase in thickness
to the east. Strongly indurated beds of ironstone are also fairly common. Maximum depth of the formation is about 120 meters.
The Queen City formation forms the dominant lithology of the central 70% of the Cypress basin, striking southwest to north­
east (Fig. 2). The interbedding of permeable and impermeable layers produces numerous structural settings conducive to
groundwater transport, and many springs are known to occur in the outcrop area (Table 3). Ferruginous sandstone, low grade
orthoquartzites, glauconitic and ferruginous pigments and potters clay can all be acquired from Queen City outcrops. The most
commonly associated soil types are arenic paleudults and typic paleudults.
Reklaw Formation
The formation is composed of two members, an upper one of brownish black to brownish gray silty clay, and a tower one of
brown, fine grained argillaceous quartz sand. Thickness of the clay member ranges from 10 meters in the west to 30 meters in
the east, and that of the sand member from three meters in the west to five meters in the east. Two narrow outcrop belts
occur to either side of the Queen City outcrop, following the same directional trend (Fig. 2). The upper member of the Reklaw
formation functions as an aquaclude, and the lower member as an aquifer that is hydraulically connected with the underlying
Carrizo formation. Potters clay and sandstone suitable for ground stone tool manufacture can be procured from the Reklaw
formation. Outcrops of the upper clay member prodUce soils classifiable as typic udorthents and lithic udorthents, and those
of the lower sand member are associated with typic paleudults.
~ Formation (Carrizo Sand)
The composition of this unit is much like that of the Sparta formation, being dominated by fine-grained quartz sand,

12

which

weathers to various shades of red and brown. Thin beds of silt and clay occur infrequently, and indurated ledges of ironstone
are fairly common in its upper part. Maximum thickness of the formation is about 15 meters, decreasing eastward. Two very
narrow outcrop belts Lie to the immediate east and west of those of the Reklaw formation, following the same directional
trend. The eastern outcrop of the carrizo formation is much narrower than the western one, seldom exceeding 1 km in width,
and could not be mapped on the scaLe of the base map used in this study (Fig. 2). The sand beds of the unit function as
aquifers and the cLay beds as aquacludes, producing muLtiple structuraL settings conducive to spring discharge, if at a
somewhat lesser frequency than is true for the Queen City formation. The sandstone of the Carrizo formation is too poorly
consolidated for use in ground stone tool manufacture, but potters cLay is probabLy available. The very Low silt/clay content
of the unit as a whole has inhibited argillic horizon formation, and the most commonly associated soils are typic quartzip­
samments, typic udipsamments, typic dystrochrepts and lithic dystrochrepts.
l.Iilcox Group
The l.Iilcox group is a very complex system of interlensing, discontinuous beds of quartz sand, sandy and silty cLay and lig­
nite. The quartz sand accounts for 30 to 50% of its mass, but the individual beds tend to be thin and discontinuous. The unit
contains abundant plant fossils, and weathers to various shades of gray, brown, yelLow and red. Thickness ranges from 150 to
300 meters. Outcrops of the Wilcox group dominate the upland lithoLogy of the northwest and southeast ends of the Cypress
basin (Fig. 2). Some small remnants of the Reklaw and Carrizo formations occur within Wilcox areas at higher elevations. The
interbedding of permeable and impermeable layers produces numerous aquifer/aquaclude oppositions, and many springs have been
recorded in Wilcox group outcrop areas (Table 3). Siltstone, petrified wood, ferruginous sandstone and ferruginous pigments
can all be procured from l.Iilcox outcrops. The complex variation in parent material composition over very short distances
produces an analogous complexity of soiLs. Typic udipsamments, typic dystrochrepts, arenic paleudults and typic paleudults
aLL occur, and individual plots of a given soil group tend to be quite small.
Midway Group
The Midway group, a Paleocene unit, is the oLdest unit outcropping in the Cypress basin, and is quite different in composi­
tion from all of the previously described deposits. The group is composed of dense, calcareous clay, with some thin beds of
hard limestone, and weathers to a medium gray. TotaL thickness of the Midway group exceeds 180 meters. There is only one
small outcrop of this unit in the far southeastern corner of the basin (Fig. 2). The unit is aLmost completely impermeable,
and forms the effective base of groundwater flow. The clay might be suitable for ceramic manufacture, and limestone for use
in the manufacture of stone effigy pipes and other such items could be acquired from some Localities. Soils associated with
outcrops of the Midway group can be classified as typic paleudalfs and mollic paleudalfs.

2.4.2 Summary of Soils
Like that of the surface geology, a discussion of the
soils of the Cypress basin can profitably be divided into
upland and valley associations. The soils of the uplands are
of early Pleistocene age, for the most part. Sandy parent
material, high rainfall variably distributed through the
seasons, dense forest vegetation and the great age of the
landforms have combined to produce ultisols with sandy ochric
epipedons and underlying argillic horizons in most areas. The
sandy surface horizons of these soils are easily worked with
hand tools, but they have been severely leached of nutrients
and are of low available base content and high acidity.
Without nutrient supplementation, such soils can only be
farmed for a few years, and then must be allowed to lie
fallow for a decade or more. A swidden pattern would be the
simplest horticultural adaptation to these soils. Where the
soil is excessively high in sand or clay content, psamments
and orthents tend to occur, respectively. Both are probably
unsuitable for horticulture. The former are excessively weLL
drained and too devoid of nutrients in their upper leveLs to
support shallow rooted vegetation, and the latter would be
very difficult to work with hand tools.

soils are periodically flooded by water laden with silt and
organic matter. Therefore, although the soils are still
relatively acid on an absolute scaLe, their nutrient content
is much higher than that of the upland soils. Probably the
most attractive vaLley soils, from a horticultural point of
view, are those of the floodplain rises and valley margin
terraces, which are sandier, better drained and which offer a
much lower risk of flood damage than those of the floodplain
floor. The relative recency of the parent material has al­
lowed only limited time for the development of soil horizons,
and the most common soils are psamments, fluvents and dystro­
chrepts.

2.6 Hydrology
The hydrology of an area can be approached from a number
of different viewpoints: water supply, flood potential, geo­
morphological effects and so forth. The effects of fluvial
processes on the topography of the Cypress basin have been
briefly discussed in Section 2.3. The objective of the fol­
lowing discussion is to isolate those hydrologic factors
affecting aboriginal water supply. It is likely that the
hydrology of the basin influenced aboriginal settlement
patterns in a profound way. Specifically, the pattern of
groundwater discharge in the Cypress basin is such as to
provide quite reliable water supplies in the uplands, far
from any substantial watercourse. As this situation is of
considerable archeologicaL importance, the relevant environ­
mental data will be presented in detail in the discussion
which follows.
In any region, there are typically three primary sources
of surface water available: natural lakes, streams and
springs. Natural lakes are not common in the Cypress basin.
The only natural impoundment of any size is Caddo Lake, which
is apparently of fairly recent origin (Gibson 1969: 7-9). The
only natural impoundments that occur with any frequency are
the sLoughs or oxbow lakes on the floodplains of the major

watercourses. The water of these lakes is often quite clear
and potable, but most are shallow and can be expected to dry
up in late summer. And again, this source of water is avail­
able only aLong the major watercourses. Mechanisms for the
natural impoundment of upland streams are lacking. There is
no recorded evidence of aboriginal dam construction, although
it is certainly possible that impoundments of small upland
streams existed. Outcrops of bedrock suitable for such a
purpose are rare in the Cypress basin, given its humid cli­
mate, and any aboriginal impoundments therefore would proba­
bly have been of wood and/or earth construction. One can well
imagine that such structures would be fairly rapidly erased
by post-abandonment erosion and modern CUltivation practices.
In short, floodplain sloughs are virtuaLly the only demon'
strable lacustrine water source.
The streams of the basin represent a somewhat more
Ubiquitous but less predictable water source. Stream flow is
dependent on three potential sources: 1) direct runoff, or
precipitation which flows directly across the ground surface
and into the stream; 2) delayed runoff, or precipitation
which infiltrates the sandy surface horizon of the upland
ultisols and then percolates downslope along the top of the
argillic horizon to emerge into a stream channel; and 3)
groundwater discharge, the effluent through springs and seeps

basin, it is interesting to note that, according to Broom
(1971: 26-27), spring-fed streams and small impoundments
continue to meet virtually all of the water needs of beef
cattle in Cass and Marion counties. Some well water is with­
drawn for livestOCk, but is used primarily to sustain poul­
try. Farm wells are stilL typically quite shallow, extending
no more than 15 meters below the surface at any point in the
landscape to reach a reliable water suppLy. Springflow also
continues to be seasonally dependable. Smith et al. (1966: 8,
12-15, Table 2) found springs to be flowing throughout 1964,
a year when rainfall across the Cypress basin was 45 to 70%
below normal.

Streams dependent only on direct runoff are intermittent
in flow to an extreme, and are not reliable water sources.
Smi th and Welborn (1967) have performed flow studies on such
a stream, Pin Oak Creek, in Hill and limestone counties,
Texas. The basin of the creek is 45.6 sq km in area. It lies
entirely within the BLackland Prairie, and thus drains an
area of very slowly permeable silty clays and clays. No
springs are known to occur within its basin. Mean annual
rainfall is lOS cm. The topography is gently rolling, and 80%
of the basin has been contour terraced, with the other 20%
under forest. The authors found that stream flow peaked
within six hours after each rainfall event, and dropped to

seriation can then be used to define the diachronic relation­
ships of these assemblages to one another, and detailed local
chronologies can be developed. The interpretive utility of
single component sites in a region where stratified sites are
rare and hard to find can not be understated.

Further, in areas of low site density, it can more
plausibly be assumed that proximate sites exhibiting similar
artifact assemblages (taking into account any differences
possibly attributable to site function) are contemporaneous
and related. Settlement problems are therefore much more
easily addressed in such areas. Models of intersite pattern­
ing and chronology developed in upland areas can then be used
to unravel the complexity of the more intensively occupied
As is discussed below in Chapter 3, Section 3.3, many of valleys.
the more important archeological sites on record in the
Cypress basin were discovered and investigated by A.T. Jack­
son and other UniVersity of Texas archeologists in the 1930s.
Much of the uplands were under cultivation at that time, and
very serious erosion occurred. Jackson and his colleagues
operated under no topographic constraints or biases, and
located sites wherever they could be found through leads from
local informants. Many of the sites recorded were in the
uplands, distant from any major watercourse. The largest
Caddoan cemetery on record in the basin, H.R. Taylor (41HS3),
lies just below an interfluvial divide (Fig. 20). Even an
Early Caddoan mound (Minnie Garrison, 41W016) was found high
in the uplands of the western Cypress basin.
Archeological survey of the uplands has also suffered
from the concentration of most research prior to the 1980s on
reservoir basin salvage. Most of the intensive surveys per­
formed in northeast Texas (prior to the lignite surveys of
recent years) have been confined to the valleys of major
watercourses, and such is certainly the case in the Cypress
basin.

Water supply is a very unpredictable phenomenon in the
Cypress basin. As the spring information indicates, sources
of water can be found in many unexpected places, far into the
uplands. Nor, as the comparison of Big Sandy and lake Fork
creeks has shown, is drainage basin area a reliable index of
water supply stability along streams. The base flow of a
stream during extended dry periods is a function of ground­
water discharge rather than direct or delayed runoff. The
surface area of its drainage basin is therefore Largely
irrelevant to the question of water supply stability. The
sustained flow of a stream is dependent upon the hydrologic
characteristics of the geologic strata outcropping in its
basin, and the presence of structural settings conducive to
aquifer discharge.
One should not conclude that I am suggesting that site
density in the uplands is ever likely to approach that along
the major watercourses. All of the available evidence sug­
gests that sites do tend to occur at a much higher density in
the stream valleys than in the surrounding uplands (Chapter
7). Causes for this pattern are not difficult to identify.
The valleys probably offered greater biotic diversity to food
collectors and better soils to horticulturalists. The point
is rather to demonstrate the danger of the opposite assump­
tion; i.e., that sites will occur only aLong the larger
streams. This is simply not the case.
It is perhaps misguided to assume that low site density
is undesirable for archeological research. In some ways, the
opposite is true. The more marginal upland areas may offer
ideal laboratories within which to address problems of chro­
nology and settlement system. Sites in areas of low density
are more likely to be single coq:x>nent, and thus may permit
the definition of synchronous artifact assemblages. Intersite

1) Locations were classified as definite springs only where a
positive identification of the presence of a spring could be
made in the published hydrology literature or on a USGS
1:24,000 scale (7.5') topographic map. Archeological sites at
which springs have been reported (Fig. 4) are not included in
this table as it was often iq:lOssible to determine the exact
location of the spring itself.

current archeological techniques. However, the fact remains
that these individuals excavated more sites within the Cy­
press basin than any single project or investigator since
(with the possible exception of some private individuals),
producing a very large body of site-specifiC archeological
information. Eighteen cemeteries, four mound sites and eight
middens were tested or completely excavated.
The collection of intact or restored ceramic vessels
reeovered from mortuary context during the 1930s, comprising
some 1,528 specimens, offers a substantial basis for inter­
site comparisons of ceramic attributes. Early formulations of
a regional chronology (c.f. Krieger 1946; Suhm et al. 1954)
relied heavily on this material, and its research potential
is far from exhausted. If an analysis of these collections is
preceded by a careful and critical assessment of their pro­
venience reliability on a site-by-site basis, specimens of
dubious context can be weeded out. The remaining material can
then be sorted into individual grave lots, each representing
an assemblage. Reliable feature associations of artifacts of
this nature are rare in northeast Texas.
The present study primarily utilizes the cemetery data,
and secondarily data from middens, to suggest certain refine­
ments In local chronology, to theorize about the nature of
Late Caddoan sociopolitical organization and to attempt a
preliminary identification of Late Caddoan social group
boundaries in the study area (Chapter 7). The analysis of the
grave goods in the present study has of necessity been rela­
tively cursory, given the size of the data base under consid­
eration. It should by no means be considered that the prob·
lems J address have been resolved. The intent is rather to
identify those regional problems most in need of further
Investigation which can be pursued on the basis of the infor­
mation compiled by the early UT investigators and others, and
to formuLate hypotheses relative to those probLems which
might provide fruitful direction to future research.
3.4 FerreLL's Bridge Reservoir: 1951-1960
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a large
reservoir in the middle reaches of Big Cypress Creek during
the 1950s. Referred to as Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir at the
time, the impoundment has since been renamed Lake 0' The
Pines (Fig. 1). The former designation will be used to refer
to the reservoir in this study.
The archeological saLvage work associated with the
Ferrell's Bridge project was financed entirely by federal
funds. A reconnaissance survey of the reservoir basin was
funded by the Smithsonian Institution in 1951. The River
Basin Survey office in Austin was responsible for the recon­
naissance, and the actual field work was performed by E.O.
Miller and E.H. Moorman, under the supervision of Robert L.
Stephenson and Edward B. Jelks. An unsystematic survey of
small, scattered sections of the basin recorded 31 sites
(41CP3, 6-9; 41HS6-10i 41MR1, 2, 5-21; 41MX9; and 41UR3) and
revisited one previously recorded site (41TT7). The survey
methodology was a combination of tracking down leads provided
by local informants and the inspection of easiLy accessibLe
landforms deemed to be likely locations for archeological
sites. All visibLe materials were collected from the surface

each site in an uncontrolled manner. Testing was limited
random, uncontrolled shovel tests. Approximately 70% of
reservoir basin was under forest at this time (Miller et
1951).

More intensive archeologicaL investigations were per­
formed by The University of Texas (UT) from 1957 to 1960,
during and subsequent to the cLearing of the basin, under the
financial auspices of the National Park Service. Edward B.
Jelks and E. Mott Davis were responsible for the administra­
tion of the investigations. An intensive, systematic survey
designed to inventory all identifiable cultural resources
within the reservoir basin was never undertaken. A second
reconnaissance survey was performed by William A. Davis in
the spring of 1957, following a methodology much like that of
Miller and Moorman. Limited survey continued on an intermit­
tent basis throughout the course of the project. Thirty-six
sites were recorded in and around the basin from 1957 to 1960
(41CP10; 41HS11, 12; 41MR3, 4, 27, 28A-D, 28F-H, 29-35, 59;
41MX8, 20-22; 41TT44; and 41UR9-18).
The relatively low number of aites recorded reflects a
primary commitment of resources at an early stage of the
project to the excavation of known sites. Twenty-three sites
were tested (41CP8; 41HS10; 41MR4, 10, 11, 14, 27, 28A-D,
28F-H, 31, 32, 34; 41MX8; and 41UR9, 13, 14, 16, 18), five
were partially excavated (41MR1, 2, 12; and 41UR11, 12) and
one was completely excavated (41UR10). All excavations were
made by handi no machine equipment was used. Caddoan sites
were concentrated upon in the excavations: of the primary
components at each site, five were mound sites, with or
without associated occupation areas (41CP8; 41MR2; and
41UR10, 11, 18); 20 were occupation areas 41HS10; 41MR1, 4,
10, 14, 27, 28A-D, 28F-H, 31, 32; 41MX8; and 41UR3, 9, 13,
14); and one cemetery was partially excavated (41MR12). Only
one purely preceramic site received significant attention
(41UR12). Reports of the excavations at seven sites were
prepared (E. Davis 1958; Jelks and Tunnell 1959; TunnelL
1959a, 1959b; E. Davis and Gipson 1960; E_ Davis and Golden
1960; W. Davis and E. Davis 1960).
In short, the Ferrell's Bridge investigations were
strong on the provision of detailed intrasite information of
specific site types, but weak in the assessment of overall
site density and distribution. A substantial number of sites
received a level of investigation sufficient to permit a
comfortable evaluation of the chronological and functionaL
characters of their components (a rare occurrence in north­
east Texas), but the number of sites recorded was undoubtedly
far exceeded by the number which passed unrecorded. A total
of 64 archeoLogical sites was recorded during the course of
the Ferrell's Bridge project in a reservoir basin comprising
some 155 sq Ian. Th i s emphas i s on excavat i on and its resul ts
are in marked contrast to those of the subsequent Southern
Methodist University (SMU) investigations to the northwest,
where resources were concentrated on inventory surveys, at
the expense of testing and excavation. For example, at Lake
Bob Sandlin, 136 sites were recorded in a reservoir basin
covering roughly 40 sq km, but only seven sites were tested,
and none were excavated to any substantial degree. This point
will be returned to in the discussion of the SMU investiga­
tions which follows (Sec. 3.5.5).

Perhaps the greatest research contribution of the
Ferrell's Bridge project was its intensive investigation of a
number of Caddoan mound and occupation sites belonging to a
ceramic complex termed the Whelan complex by E. Mott Davis
(1958). Similar components have been identified by this study
beyond the confines of the reservoir (Fig. 14). On the basis
of certain ceramic attributes, Davis believed the complex to
be cont~raneous with the Bossier focus defined by Webb
(1948b) to the east, and precedent to the surrounding and
adjacent sites of the Titus focus as defined by Krieger
(1946) and Suhm et al. (1954). I am in agreement with those
interpretations. The Ferrell's Bridge data have played a
crucial role in the development of the local chronology as a
whole, as will become clear in succeeding chapters.

3.5.2 Lake Swauano
This reservoir is on Swauano Creek in Titus County (Fig.
and is now referred to on most maps as Welsh Reservoir.
It will be referred to in this study by its original name,
Lake Swauano. Covering roughly 12 sq km, the reservoir was
constructed by the Southwestern Electric Power Company
(SWEPCO) of Shreveport as a source of cooling water for an
associated electric generating plant. SWEPCO funded the
archeological investigation as part of an environmental
assessment prepared by Sargent and Lundy, Inc., a Chicago
engineering firm.

3.5 Southern Methodist University: 1968-1975
Southern Methodist University (SMU) has been largely
responsible for all of the reservoir-related archeological
investigations which have occurred in the Cypress basin since
Ferrell's Bridge. Five major projects have been completed by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and various local reservoir
authorities during this period: an enlargement of Caddo Lake
in 1968-1969; and the construction of four new reservoirs in
the northwestern quadrant of the basin from 1969 to 1978:
Welsh Reservoir (Lake Swauano), Lake Cypress Springs, Lake
MonticeLLo and Lake Bob Sandlin (Fig. 1). In the discussion
which follows, a short summary of each archeological project
is provided, and then the overall character of the SMU inves­
tigations is addressed.
3.5.1

Caddo Lake Enlargement

In August of 1968, Jon L. Gibson, under the direction of
James V. Sciscenti, conducted a reconnaissance survey around
the margins of Caddo Lake for SHU (Gibson 1969). The project
was necessitated by the construction of a new dam by the u.s.
Army Corps of Engineers immediately downstream of the origi­
nal one (Sec. 1.2), raising the lake level one meter, and
flooding an additional 20 sq km. Funding for the reconnais­
sance was provided by the National Park Service.
Gibson does not describe his survey methods, but does
state that less than three weeks was devoted to the field
work. One would assume that only a small sample of the total
study area was actually surveyed. Gibson also consulted the
field notes of Clarence H. Webb in Shreveport. Eleven sites
are described in the report; seven in Caddo Parish, two in
Marion County and two in Harrison County. Four of the sites
had been previously recorded by Webb (16CD8, 16CD17, 16CD19
and 41HS240), and seven were recorded by Gibson's reconnais­
sance (x16CD2, 4, 5, 7; 41HS241; 41MR51, 60).
The recommendations of Gibson's report (ibid.) did not
incLude a suggestion that a full inventory survey be made.
Two sites were recommended for testing (16CD19 and x16C03),
and two for complete excavation (41HS240 and 41MR51). No
further archeological work was funded prior to inundation.
The sites inundated included two rather famous ones: Harri­
son Bayou (41HS240) and Swanson's Landing (16CD8). The sites
played a role both in Ford's (1936) original isolation of the

An archeological reconnaissance of the reservoir basin
was performed in 1973 by SHU, under the direction of Olin F.
McCormick III (1973a). The study was intended by SMU only to
represent a preliminary assessment of the cultural resources,
and McCormick (ibid.:5) notes that lithe reconnaissance was
designed to cover the entire reservoir and plant area in a
cursory mamer." A crew of ten students spent three days
walking over 30% of the total project area, concentrating on
easily accessible areas in cultivation or pasture, where
landforms deemed to represent likely site locations occurred
(floodplain rises, terrace remnants and upland projections
into the fluvial floodplain). Thirty-four archeological sites
were recorded in this mamer (41T1223-256), and one previous­
Ly recorded site was visited (41TT13). No surface coLLections
of artifacts were made, and no testing was done.
The data presented on these sites in the present study
is entirely derived from McCormick's report (ibid.), and is
necessarily rather terse and generalized due to the nature of
the data presentation therein. The artifacts and associated
materials appearing on the surface were not quantified, nor
were they described in sufficient detail to permit chronolog­
ical classifications beyond Preceramic or Ceramic in most
cases. The Lake Swauano data have played no significant role
in the interpretive segment of this study.
3.5.3

The previous appellations of the lake were Franklin
County Reservoir and Big Cypress Reservoir. Located on the
upper reaches of Big Cypress Creek in Franklin County (Fig.
1), the reservoir covers roughly 17 sq km. The impoundment
was constructed by the Franklin County Water District to
serve as a water supply for the town of Mount Vernon, some 18
km to the northwest.
An archeological reconnaissance of the reservoir basin
was jointly funded by the National Park Service and the Texas
Water Development Board. It was performed in the fall and
winter of 1968-1969 by a joint team from Southern Methodist
University and the Texas State Building Commission (Hsu et
al. 1969). The total number of person days and the percentage
of the reservoir basin actually covered by the reconnaissance
are not stated in the report. As at lake Swauano, the survey
apparently concentrated on likely landforms in easily acces­

3.5.4 Lakes Monticello and Bob Sandlin
In the late 196Os, the Titus County Fresh Water Supply
District No.1 developed plans for a single reservoir, to be
called Titus County Reservoir, which would impound Big Cy­
press, Blundell and Brushy creeks downstream of Lake Cypress
springs. The reservoir was to serve as a water supply for the
municipality of Mount Pleasant, and secondarily for flood
control and recreational purposes. At the same time, a con­
sortium of electric power companies (Dallas Power and Light,
Texas Electric Service and Texas Power and Light) represented
by Texas Utilities Services, Inc., was deveLoping plans for
the construction of a coal-fired electric generating plant
and lignite strip mine near Winfield (Fig. 1). Such plants
require a substantial quantity of water for cooling purposes,
and a small reservoir was needed adjacent to the power plant.
In 1970, after brief negotiations between the local
reservoir authority and the utilities consortium, it was
agreed to divide Titus County Reservoir into two impound­
ments. A smaller reservoir, called Lake Monticello, was
constructed by the utilities consortium on Blundell Creek,
and now serves as a cooling pond for the Monticello power
pLant. The reservoir authority constructed a second and much
larger lake on Big Cypress and Brushy creeks for the purposes
originally envisioned. The reservoir is now called lake Bob
Sandlin, but has also been referred to as Bob Sandlin Reser­
voir and Cherokee Trails Reservoir in the past. Lake Monti­
cello covers some 14 sq km, and Lake Bob Sandlin about 40 sq
km. The two reservoirs were completed in 1975 and 1978,
respectively.
An archeoLogical reconnaissance of the entire Titus
County Reservoir basin was performed in the fall and winter
of 1968-1969, concurrent with the Lake Cypress Springs
project. Subsequent archeoLogicaL investigations concentrated

3.5.4.2 Lake Monticello
Both the survey and mitigation phases at Lake Monticello
were performed by SMU, under the supervision of Olin F.
McCormiCK III. The work was entirely funded by Texas Utili­
ties Services, Inc. An intensive survey of the reservoir
basin and small portions (ca. 20%) of the associated mining
area was conducted from May of 1971 to January of 1972 on an
intermittent basis, involving a total labor investment of 180
person-days (McCormick 1973b). The survey was conducted by
walking over only those areas where the surface was relative­
ly visible, that is, areas in pasture, in cultivation, or
that had been recently cleared, comprising roughly 60% of the
reservoir basin. Heavily wooded areas and marshes were not
surveyed. Surface collections were not made on a regular
basis, and no testing was done during the survey. Fifty-nine
archeological sites were recorded (41FK41-43; and 41TT127­
166, 168-183) and eight previously recorded sites were visit­
ed (41FK3; and 41TT12, 16, 23-25, 27, 28) within the present
study area. A number of sites were recorded in the mining
area which are not inside the Cypress basin, and which there­
fore have not been included in this study.
All of the information provided in this study for
41TT127-166 and 41TT168-183 is derived from McCormick's
(ibid.) report of the results of the survey, and from survey
forms on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
in Austin. The site descriptions in the report, presented in
a tabular format, quantify site area where possible, but
contain no description or quantification of the artifact
sample from each site. Rather, the sites are classified in
terms of postulated activities believed to have occurred
there (e.g. food preparation, lithic manufacture, etc.) and a
very simple chronological dichotomy (Archaic or Neo­

not descr i bed at all.
All of the SMU projects suffered from a rather myopic
attempt at an environmentally-oriented classification of
sites according to function. The concept itself is a positive
and potentially productive one, but the categories of their
modal were never justified on any archeologicaL or ethno­
graphic basis. The modal was used as a classificatory scheme
without testing. No account was taken of the mixing of non­
contemporaneous materials in multicomponent sites. At the
worst (McCormick 1973b), sites were simply classified accord­
ing to presumed functional type with no description whatsoev­
er of the artifact assemblage.

All visible materials were coLlected from the surface of
each site recorded by the reconnaissance, but no testing was
done. The data on site area and artifact associations record­
ed on the survey forms (which are on fiLe at the Texas Arche­
ologicaL Research Laboratory in Austin) and reported by GSRI
(ibid.) are quite detailed in most cases. This information
has proven useful to the present study, in particular because
GSRI recorded a number of sites along an important and very
poorLy documented segment of Big Cypress Bayou between the
Ferrell's Bridge project area and Caddo Lake. To my knowl­
edge, the channelization project has not progressed beyond
the planning stage, and no further archeologicaL investiga­
tions associated with that project have taken place.

It seems fundamental that one can not undertake a set­

the archeological division of the department within the past
decade: 41CP21, 41C5119, 41FK33, 41H517, 41H533, 41TT13,
41TT108 and 41UR25. Although exact figures of area excavated
vs. total site area are not available, it is clear that the
intensity of investigation of these sites has varied consid­
erably. The testing of 41CS119, 41FK33 and 41UR25 was quite
cursory, intended only to establ ish the depth and condition
of the archeological deposit at each site. Somewhat larger
but still very limited areas were excavated at 41CP21 and
41TT108, recovering substantial artifact samples but failing
to identify any cultural features. Major portions of 41H517,
41HS33 and 41TT13 were excavated. The results of the investi·
gations at 41H517 have been published (Luke 1978: Weir 1971,

cal work occurred at Lake Bob Sandlin prior to its fiLling in
the fall and winter of 1978.
3.7.4 Proposed Black Cypress and Marshall (Little Cypress)
Reservoirs (added 1989)
A very preliminary assessment of the archeological
resources of two proposed reservoirs on Black Cypress Bayou
and LittLe Cypress Creek has been performed by Northern and
Skiles (1981) for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. No actual
survey was done, and no sites were formally recorded. The
study was an overview stage analysis as prescribed by the
Council of Texas Archeologists guidelines (1985). A number of
the avocationsl archeologists and collectors in both project
areas were interviewed to gain an initial impression of the
character of the sites present. Northern and Skiles supply a
useful listing of these individuals, and recommended that any
survey be preceded by the recording of their collections and
site location information (op. cit.: 52).

basin in 1975 for the Texas Historical Commission: 41HS31,
41MR57, 41MR58, 41TT104, 41TT105 and 41TT222. The sites were
identified through historical documentation, and their loca·
tions determined from county courthouse property ownership
records. The field work concentrated on making assessments of
the conditions of the sites thus identified. No surface
collections were made, and no testing was done. The results
of the survey have never been published, as Malone died in
1977 before completing the report.

3.8.5 Private Collectors
attempt both.
The less promising side of the avocational archeological
activity which continues to take place within the Cypress
basin is the work of numerous local artifact collectors who
seek only to recover specimens for their collections. Such
individuals typically do not utilize careful excavation
techniques, do not document what they find, and do not cata­
log their artifacts as to provenience. The result of such
activity, if sufficiently intense, is the destruction of an
archeological site. The severity of this problem can not be
understated; I am aware of over 50 active collectors in the
Bob Sandlin Reservoir area alone. Many sites have been and
continue to be seriously disturbed or destroyed by such
activity.
It is very difficult to convince a collector that it is
the information, and not the artifacts themselves, in which
archeologists are interested. Many individuals guard their
information and their knowledge (particularly of site loca­
tions) jealously, and through suspicion of the motives of
archeologists, refuse to share the information they could
offer.
In many ways, the prospect for the future is disturbing.
There is no one coming to the fore among the younger individ­
uals of the area who shares the interest in careful documen­
tation of a Clarence Webb or Bob Turner. And again, the
"",l1lber of "hardcorell collectors becoming active is stagger­
ing, as the renewed economic development of the area draws in
individuals who hold no sense of identity with or responsi­
bility for the region. Large scale archeological projects can
also pLaya substantial role in exacerbating the intensity of
collector activity. Purchase of Large tracts of Land, as for
a reservoir, opens them to public access, and the related
archeological salvage work tends to emphasize the presence of
archeological sites. Collectors have been known to shadow
survey crews, and the activity involved in recording a site
tends to telegraph its location. If intensive investigation
is carried out at a site, it is a virtuaL certainty that
collectors will descend upon it as soon as the archeologists
have left.
Under these circumstances, it is more than ever the
responsibility of professional archeoLogists to work with
private collectors with two objectives in mind: education and
documentation. First, the more sophisticated aspects of an
interest in prehistory must be conveyed to the Local resi­
dents, and an appreciation of the complexities and potential
personal satisfaction of the pursuit of problems rather than
specimens should be aroused. Second, we should take it on
ourselves to, wherever possible, document the results of the
activities of the private collectors in the areas where we
work. It is possible to do both profitably. Much of the
information which was accumulated in the Bob Sandlin area
during the 1978 UT Austin fieLd school was acquired from or
with the help of private collectors.

3.9 SlIIIllary
Compared to many parts of Texas, the archeological
investigation of the Cypress basin has been relatively in­
tense, beginning early in the twentieth century and continu­
ing up to the present day. A considerable body of data has
been amassed, and a synthesis and assessment of the existing
data base is long overdue. Archeological research can not
progress in sophistication and productiveness unless we
periodicaLLy synthesize the information gathered up to the
present, identify those probLems in need of further investi­
gation, rank them in terms of relative priority, and devise
means of addressing them.
Any attempt at such a synthesiS must accommodate the
extreme variability in the quality and character of the
existing data which has resulted from a corresponding diver­
sity in the character of the archeological investigations
responsible for their accumulation. The preceding review of
archeological research in the Cypress basin has attempted to
convey something of that diversity by addressing the method­
ology and objectives of each investigator or project. Nor has
the intensity of archeological work been uniform across the
basin; some areas have been quite carefully surveyed and have
experienced numerous excavations, but the greater part of the
basin remains completely unexplored. The relative intensity
of investigation within the basin is illustrated in Figure 5.
It is highly recommended that the reader refer back to that
illustration in attempting to assess the site distribution
maps which follow in Chapter 5 (Figs. 7-16).
The manner in which the present study has attempted to
deal with the diversity of the data base is described in
Chapter 4, and the data are presented in Chapters 5 and 6.
The classifications used in ordering the data are deliberate­
ly simplistic; such is the strategy of the present study in
attempting to impose some uniformity upon that diversity.
Other students can undoubtedly devise more productive means
of ordering the data for comparative purposes, but it is
hoped that the present study will at least succeed in estab­
lishing the research potential of existing collections,
documentation and publications from the Cypress basin, and
will provide some useful direction to future research in the
area.

Definition of the Study Area

At the inception of this study, I was interested in
performing a synthesis of the available archeoLogical infor­
mation from a portion of northeast Texas smalL enough to be
manageable within the constraints of a master's thesis, but
sufficientLy Large to permit the discerning of broad geo­
graphic trends. A major drainage basin seemed a reasonable
choice as it offered a rapid and accurate circumscription of
a study area, independent of modern political boundaries. The
cypress basin was chosen for four reasons: 1) it is of a size
suitable to balance the areal considerations noted above; 2)
I had previously worked in the area, and was already familiar
with the northwestern end of the basinj 3) a large number of
sites had been recorded in the basin and 4) previous archeo­
Logical interpretations of northeast Texas and northwest
louisiana indicated that the Cypress basin would straddle the
boundary between two major late prehistoric aboriginal social
groups, one centered on the mainstem of the Red River and the
other in the uplands to the northwest.
Two U.S. GeoLogicaL Survey (USGS) topographic map series
were used as working base maps in this study: the 1:250,000
scale (1 degree) series where broad overviews of the basin
were called for, and the 1:24,000 scale (7.5 ' ) series for
more detailed purposes. In order to preciseLy define the
limits of the study area, the drainage divides between the
cypress basin and the neighboring Sulphur basin to the north
and the Sabine basin to the south were first determined on
the four 1:250,000 scale maps which incorporate the study
area eEL Dorado, Shreveport, Texarkana and Tyler). The di­
vides were located by following the topographic highs between
the finger tributaries of Cypress Creek and those of the
neighboring drainages. In the east, the low lying topography
along the interface between the Cypress Creek and Red River
drainages made an accurate definition of the divide impossi­
ble. By chance of nature, the northern and southern bound­
aries of the Cypress basin each carry to within 500 meters of
the present Red River mainstem (Fig. 1). Therefore, for ease
of definition, these two gaps were arbitrarily jumped, and
the study area was carried to the west bank of the Red River.

sources, primarily from Gibson 1969; Moore 1912; Neuman 1969;
Webb 1948, 1959; and Webb and McKinney 1975. It would have
been preferabLe to also consult the records and coLlections
of Clarence H. Webb in shreveport and louisiana State Univer­
sity (lSU) in Baton Rouge, but the financial constraints of a
graduate student made this impossible.
Hoffman (1969: 102) reported that no archeoLogicaL sites
had been recorded in the Arkansas section of the Cypress
basin as of the time of that writing. A conversation by
teLephone with the staff of the Arkansas Archeological Survey
in Fayetteville in the fall of 1980 confirmed that no sites
had been reported in the relevant portion of Miller County as
of that date. No organized archeological survey had been
performed in that area.
Thus, the majority of the archeological sites included
in this study (437 of 478) have been recorded in the Texas
section of the Cypress basin. The primary sources of informa­
tion which I consulted on Texas sites were the records and
collections of the Texas Archeological Research laboratory
(TARl) of The University of Texas at Austin. TARL acts as a
central repository of archeological information in Texas,
with which most institutions performing archeological re­
search in the state coordinate site documentation. It is
common practice to, at a minimum, provide site survey forms
and site location plottings on USGS 1:24,000 scale topograph­
ic maps to TARl. Furthermore, many of the better documented
sites in the Cypress basin have been investigated by The
University of Texas, and all of the documentation and collec­
tions from those sites are housed at TARl.
The information collected at TARl was supplemented by an
investigation of the records and collections of the Texas
Department of Highways and Public Transportation (TDHPT)
Archeology Division in Austin, and by consultation of all
identifiable published reports containing site-specific data
from the study area.

It should be emphasized at this juncture that the only
artifact collections which I have actually viewed and classi­
fied are those at TARl and TDHPT, and certain private collec­
tions from the northwest part of the basin. In all, I have
analyzed the coLlections from 166 of 478, or roughly 35% of
the recorded sites in the Cypress basin.

Ill.IJj)ers and

The trinomial Ill.IJj)ers of the sites plotted on each 7.5'
quad were listed on its margin, and a roster was compiled
from the maps of the sites to be studied in each parish or
county. The data collection process thereafter consisted
simply of proceeding from one such political subdivision to
the next, consulting all available sources of information for
each site, one site at a time.
A printed form was used to ensure a standardized collec­
tion of information throughout the course of the study. The
following data were compiled for each site: 1} site designa­
tions; 2) the county or parish in which the site was located;
3) the name of the 7.5" quad on which the site was Located;
4) a summary of the archeological investigations known to
have taken place at the site; 5) a list of the known pub­
lished references; 6) a description of any cultural features
recognized; 7) a classification of any artifacts or associat­
ed materials recovered or noted in the field; 8) the site
area in square meters; 9) a size classification of the tribu­
tary drainage basin in which the site was located; 10) a
classification of the geomorphological landform with which
the site was associated; 11) the chronological classification
of the components interpreted as present: 12) an Interpretive
classification of the intensity or function of each compo­
nent; 13) a description of the last known condition of the
site, and the date of that assessment; 14) any relevant
remarks and 15) the date on which the site was inventoried
during the present study. Items 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 13-15 are
self-explanatory. Further details regarding items 1, 4, 7 and
9-12 are presented below.

Where available, information regarding the investigation
of each site was recorded from the documentation on file at
TARL and from published reports. Recorded in a descriptive
format were the nature of the investigations performed, the
identities of the institutions responsible and the date(s) on
which the work occurred. A classification which has been
developed to facilitate the reporting of this information is
defined in Section 5.2.
4.3.3 Classification of Incorporating Drainage Basin
In order to study the distribution of archeological
sites within the hydrologic structure of the Cypress Creek
drainage system, four categories of subsidiary basin were
devised. The catchment categorized for each site was that of
the largest order stream within a one kilometer radius of the
center of the site. The intent of this classification is
merely to provide a gross characterization of the potential
runoff contribution to the largest nearby stream water
source.
The categories are defined as follows: a "major basin"
is greater than 100.1 sq Ian in areai an "intermediate basin"
ranges from 100.0 sq Ian to 10.1 sq km in area; a "minor
basin" is from 10.0 sq km to 2.1 sq km in area; and an
"upland basin" is a finger tributary basin 2.0 sq km or less
in area.
4.3.4 Classification of Geomorphological Landform

A series of landform categories was devised to examine
the associations of archeological sites with specific topo­
graphic positions. Two classification schemes were created,

narrow flakes were then removed to produce a very steep,
bifacially beveled edge around the entire specimen. This
final edge trimming was very carefully controlled, so that
the bevels are of very uniform width and edge sinuosity is
minimal. Overall, the high quality of workmanship and materi­
al is comparable to that of Gahagan bifaces of the Early
Caddoan peri od (Shafer 1973; Webb and Dodd 1939) and the
Anderson bifaces of the historic Allen phase (Cole 1975).

4.3.5 Classification of Artifacts
As a primary objective of this study is the identifica­
tion of components relating to specific temporal periods, the
classification of artifacts concentrated on the identifica­
tion of chronological diagnostics. Heavy reliance was there­
fore placed on the existing typology for both ceramic and
lithic artifacts, primarily following Brown 1971; Ford 1955;
Ford and Willey 1940; Newell and Krieger 1949; Suhm and Jelks
1962: Suhm et al. 1954: and Webb 1959. Certain other authors
were followed in the definition of specific typological
categories; primarily Dickson (1970) on the dart point type
Calf Creek; Duffield (1963a) on the dart point type Dawson;
Hoffman (1967) on the ceramic pipe type Red River; Jelks
(1965) on the biface type Perkin; Johnson (1962) on the dart

graved; and Wood (1963) on the arrow point type Homan. Arti­
facts and associated materials which could not be classified
typologically were sorted into descriptive categories.

The only known occurrences of Galt bifaces are in Titus
and Belcher phase contexts (Sec. 4.3.6, Table 8). In addition
to the sites listed in Table 7, specimens of the type were
apparently associated with the central individual of each
Titus phase multiple burial at 41CP17 (Sec. 6.3.1.8). No
descriptive details are available for those specimens, which
are in private collections. Incidence of the type thus ap­
pears to be limited to the late prehistoric occupations of
the two major social groups represented archeologically in
the Belcher and Titus phases. It is also quite possible that
the Galt bifaces served as badges of rank or office; probably
the latter. The sociopolitical implications of the bifaces
are discussed in Chapter 7.

4.3.6 Chronological Classification
An outline of the chronologicaL classification used in
the present study is provided in TabLe 8. Included in that
outline are estimates of the caLendric time span covered by
each chronoLogical unit and a statement of the artifacts
considered diagnostic of each such unit. As noted in Section
3.6, a detailed discussion of the deveLopment of the relevant
regionaL chronology, if adequately performed, would be a
substantial undertaking and is beyond the scope of this
study. However, a brief sunnary of the basic published
sources is provided below. Departures from previously defined
chronologies of the area are also noted, and are discussed in
more detail in Chapter 7.
A literature review of the preceramic chronology can be
profitably divided into Paleoindian and Archaic. This separa­
tion, and the further subdivision of the Paleoindian stage
into early and late periods on the basis of the presence or
absence of Clovis or Folsom fluted projectile points, foLLows
current interpretations of sites which have been excavated in
the Southwest and the Southern Plains. The preceramic culture
sequence of the Southeast is much more poorly understood, due
to a dearth of stratified sites. Probably the best summaries
of the western Paleoindian data are to be found in the publi­
cations of Hester (1975>, c. Johnson (1974), E. Johnson
(1976), Jennings (1974) and Sellards and Evans (1960). I
diverge from some researchers (c.f. Krieger 1946) in consid­
ering Meserve/Dalton, San Patrice and early side-notched
(Webb et al. 1971) project.ile points diagnostic of a late
Paleoindian rather than an Early Archaic or "Protoarchaic"
horizon, but this is reaLLy just a difference in semantics.

Within the Archaic, a basic division of the contracting
stem dart points as later and those with straight or expand­
ing stems as earlier is based on the verticaL distribution of
projectile points at seven sites in eastern Oklahoma and
eastern Texas: Doering and Koss (Wheat 1953: 204-211), Resch
(Webb et al. 1969: Fig. 26, Table 2), Sawmill (Jelks 1965:
224-226, Table 4), Scott (Bell 1953: Fig. 94), Wolfshead
(Duffield 1963b: Fig. 19, Table 2) and Yarbrough (Johnson
1962: 215, Fig. 18). At most or all of these sites, biotur­
bescence of the sort noted in Section 2.3 may be largeLy
responsible for the vertical distribution of the cultural
materiaLs. However, straight or expanding stem dart points do
tend, on a statistical basis, to occur at greater depths
below the surface than contracting stem ones at all seven
sites. One would assume that downward displacement is a time­
reLated phenomenon, and that the oLder specimens have si"1'ly
had more time to work downward (Brown 1975a).

1970).
Within the Ceramic end of the aboriginal time spectrum,
a growing awareness of a "pre-Caddoan" or Early Ceramic
horizon has developed over the past 30 years (Bell 1953: 314;
Proctor 1957; Ray 1960; Sharrock 1960: Jelks 1961: 29, 34-35,
44-50, Plates 4 and 9; Johnson 1962: 268-280; Duffield 1963b:
84, 118-122; Jelks 1965: 22-78, 113-116, 135, 216-218;
McClurkan et al. 1966: 3-26: Webb et al. 1969: 95-96; Davis
1970: 38-39; Shafer 1973: 185, 1975: 250-251; Shafer et ale
1975; 18-20; BobaLik 1977; Creel 1979: 145-148; Fields and
Thurmond 1980: 31, 46-49). Throughout northeast Texas and
eastern Oklahoma, numerous associations of rather distinctive
ceramics with contracting stem dart points have been noted.
North of the Sabine River, the most common early pottery is a
clay or clay and bone tempered ware referred to as Williams
Plain (c.f. Brown 1971: 42-57). A sandy paste ware is more
common to the south of the Sabine, but the distributions of
the two wares do overlap. Jelks (1965: 105-113, Fig. 59)
defined the sandy paste ware as a type, Bear Creek Plain.
There is substantial evidence that the Early Ceramic compo­
nents are contemporaneous with the Tchefuncte (Ford and
Quimby 1945) and Marksville/Troyville (Ford and Willey 1940;
Ford 1955) cultures of the lower Mississippi valley.
The division of the Caddoan chronological span into
early and late periods is the same as that first proposed by
Krieger in 1944 and 1946 in his definition of the Gibson and
Fulton aspects under the Midwestern Taxonomic system. further
subdivision herein of the Early Caddoan period into Periods 1
and Z parallels the chronological units defined by E.M. Davis
(1970) and Wyckoff (1971) as "Caddo 1" and "Caddo 2". This
separation is based on the presumption that the ceramics of
the Alto focus, as defined by Krieger (1946) and Suhm et al.
(1954), predate those of their Sanders and Haley foci, a
concept which has not been concLusively proven and remains
quite debatabLe. I have to think that the definition of Early
Caddoan phases at this point in time would be highly inappro­
priate, given our lack of understanding of the mechanisms of
sociopolitical integration operant during the period and our
inability to identify spatiaLLy distinct social or ethnic
groups.
The aboriginal chronology subsequent to Early Caddoan
Period 2 is divided on an east/west axis, as noted in Table
8. This in essence follows the separation made by Webb
(19480, 1959) and Krieger (1946) in their original defini­
tions of Late Caddoan local cultures in northeast Texas and
northwest Louisiana. I believe social groups on the level of
organ; zat i on termed "confederaci es" by Swanton (1942) can be
identified in the material culture after about A.D. 1300. Two
such groups, each presumably composed of multiple constituent
tribaL groups, apparently existed in late prehistoric times
within the Cypress basin: one along the mainstem of the Red
River and one in the uplands to the west. The eastern group
can possibly be associated with the Kadohadacho confederacy
(Swanton 1942: 5-16: WilLiams 1964), while the western group
does not appear to have been recognized ethnographically.

The contracting stem dart points are the most commonly
occurring diagnostics of the Late Archaic period as defined
in this study. Dart points of the expanding stem type Ensor
are also included in the Late Archaic on the basis of their
vertical distribution at the Youngsport Site (Shafer 1963:
Table 1) and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir (Sorrow et al. 1967:
Fig. 72) in Central Texas_ The remainder of the straight and
expanding stem dart points are further subdivided into Middle
and Early Archaic periods largely on the basis of the stra­

b) Late Pateoindian (8000-6000 B.C.): projectile points of the types Meserve/DaLton, Plainview,
and scottsbluff; early side-notched dart points; and Albany beveled bifaces.

2) Archaic (6000-200 B.C.): typologically unclassifiable, non-Paleoindian dart points: Perkin pikes; miscellaneous
bifacial lithic tools; a high relative incidence of lithic debitage; numerous ground stone tools; polished stone
gorgets, boatstones' and grooved axes; and Clear Fork gouges.

B) Ceramic (200 B.C. - A.D. 1650): pottery of unknown characteristics.
1) Early Ceramic (200 B.C. to A.D. 800): sandy paste ware, Williams Plain and pottery of Marksville/Troyville
period types, in the absence of Early Caddoan pottery.
2) Caddoan (A.D. 800-1650): pottery exhibiting Caddoan paste and thickness characteristics; and arrow points.
a) Early Caddoan (A.D. 800-1300): dominance of body sherd assemblage by plain, incised, punctated and finger­
nail-impressed specimens, if more than 20 sherds; pottery of the types Hickory Fine Engraved, Carmel Engraved,
Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Pennington Punctated-Incised; and Red River pipe fragments.
i) Period 1 (A.D. 800-1100): pottery of the types Davis Incised, Holly Fine Engraved, Kiam Incised, Spiro
Engraved and Weches Fingernail-Impressed: Coles Creek Incised, and other Coles Creek period ceramic
types.
ii) Period 2 (A.D. 1100-1300): pottery of the types Canton Incised, Haley Engraved, Maxey Noded Redware,
Sanders Engraved and Sanders Plain.
WESTERN CYPRESS BASIN
The material culture on either side of a north/south line which might be drawn somewhat west of Caddo Lake clearly differen­
tiates after A.D. 1300 (if not earlier), presumably reflecting the development of distinct social groups. separate chronolo­
gies are therefore presented for each area for the period A.D. 1300-1650.
a) Middle Caddoan (A.D. 1300-1400): ceramic assemblages exhibiting a fusion of Early Caddoan Period 2 and
Whelan phase concepts.
b) Late Caddoan (A.D. 1400-1600): pottery of the types Bullard Brushed and Maydelle Incised; high incidence in
sherd collection of brushed body fragments; ceramic elbow and biconical pipes.
i) Whelan Phase (A.D. 1400-1500): Ripley Engraved exhibiting motifs B-K in Figure 6, in which the border
elements are often filled with carelessly executed, curvilinear hatchuring: Pease Brushed-Incised; and
arrow points predominantly of the types Seal lorn and Perdiz.

ii) Titus Phase (A.D. 1500-1600): pottery of the types Bailey Engraved, Harleton Applique, Karnack
Brushed-Incised, La Rue Neck Banded, Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved and Wilder Engraved; and arrow
points predominantly of the types Bassett, Maud, Talco and Reed. Ripley bowls exhibit motifs A-H in
Figure 6, executed most commonly in broad, deep excising and engraving.
Caveat: One should be aware that the incidence of brushing as a utility ware decorative technique during the Late Caddoan
period declines westward in the Cypress basin, and brushing (or the lack thereof) is not a reliable time marker for the
westernmost components.

tributes. The Late Caddoan period is divided into the Whelan
phase, largely following Davis' (1958) definition of the
Whelan complex, and the Titus phase, following Krieger's
definition of the Titus focus (Krieger 1946; Suhm et al.
1954). I use the term "phase" to designate the chronological
subdivisions of a tightly circumscribed local culture. The
definition of a separate terminology to deal with the spatial
element of the old McKern "focus" concept is deferred to
Section 7.3.4.
Webb (1948b, 1959) has been followed in the eastern
Cypress basin in the definition of the Late Caddoan Bossier
and Belcher phases which are equivalent to his Bossier and
Belcher foci. As was explained in Section 4.2, all of the
information from the eastern Cypress basin presented in this
study is derived from published sources. Not having had the
opportunity to view the relevant sherd and vessel collec­
tions, I have simply followed the existing eastern Late
Caddoan chronology.
The chronological classification was employed in prac­
tice precisely as outlined in Table 8. Each component at a
given site was classified to the most detailed level possible
on the basis of the available information. For example, if it
were known only that sherds had been found at a particular
site in the Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir area, the site would
be classified as Ceramic. If it were known that a substantial
number of those sherds were brushed, the ceramic component
would be classified as Late Caddoan. And if it were known
that many of those brushed sherds were classifiable as the
type Pease Brushed-Incised, the Late Caddoan component would
be classified as Whelan phase.

The term "component", as used in this study, merely
signifies the aboriginal use of a site during the stated time
period. There may be multiple components at a given site, and
each component may represent multiple uses of the site during
the time period in question. The latter is undoubtedly true
of many Archaic "components".
The vast majority of the sites included in this study
are known only on the basis of surface collections. The
interpretation of multicomponent sites therefore must often
be made without benefit of contextual information. Generally
speaking, if the diagnostics of a particular time period (as
defined in Table 8) were present at a given site, a component
relating to that period was identified.

4.3.7

Intensity of Use/Functional Classification

An attempt has been made to characterize the intensity
and (if possible) the functional nature of the use of each
site during a given time period. Barring excavation, such
inferences must largely be drawn from the areal extent and
density of artifact surface scatter at a given site. Surface
indications of archeological sites in the heavily vegetated
northeast Texas area are subject to a bewildering number of
extraneous variables. Land use at the time of survey dramati­
cally affects the character of the surface indications. One
simply can not see the ground in a northeast Texas forest, be
it upland or floodplain. Even in an improved pasture, site
indications will be obscured unless some form of subsurface
disturbance has recently occurred. The magnitude of disturb­
ance and the agency of exposure are very important. For

40

example, rodent disturbance, a road cut and cultivation would
each convey a very different image of the same site. Topo­
graphic position is also a factor, as sites on upland slopes
are much more likely to be exposed by erosion than those in
floodplain or terrace settings. Also relevant are the activi­
ties of private collectors, the effects of which will vary
according to the proclivities of the individual collector.
Some collect only intact projectile points, some also collect
sherds, and some will scour the surface of a site clean of
cultural material. The mere detection of archeological sites
in such an environment is a severe problem. Interpretations
of sites based on surface indications must therefore be
recognized as necessarily subjective and tentative in nature.
With these problems and other weaknesses and inconsist­
encies of the data base discussed in Chapter 3 in mind,
developed a fairly simple classification of site use, based
largely on somewhat arbitrary criteria of surface indica­
tions, and employed this classification in a flexible manner,
taking into account the condition of the site at the time it
was recorded.
Preceramic sites were classified merely in terms of
intensity of use. A "limited use area" is a cooponent from
which fewer than 10 diagnostics of the period in question
were recovered. A "heavy use area ll is a cooponent from which
10 or more diagnostics are known.
Functional categories were devised for Ceramic coopo­
nents, with separate criteria for the Early Ceramic and
Caddoan periods. Ambler (1973: 145) and Shafer (1975: 18)
have assumed that the introduction of early pottery to the
southern part of the east Texas area was not accompanied by
significant change in the Late Archaic subsistence or settle­
ment patterns. which were in turn presumed to be intensive
food collection and transhumance. However, there is substan­
tial evidence of the limited cultivation of indigenous plants
in Woodland (and possibly earlier) contexts to the north and
east of Texas (c.f. Fowler 1971; Gilmore 1931; Jones 1936;
Payne and Jones 1962; Yarnell 1964). Although there is no
direct evidence of horticulture in the Cypress basin, the
data of the present study indicate that a settlement pattern
sufficiently stable to engender the construction of daubed
pole and thatch structures developed during the Early Ceramic
period. Two principal cooponent types were therefore defined
for the period. An Early Ceramic "limited use area" is a
cooponent at which fewer than 25 diagnostic sherds were
recovered from an area of less than 1000 sq m. A "small
settlement" is defined if any two of the following four
criteria are present: 1) 25 or more diagnostic sherdsj 2)
site area of 1000 sq m or greater; 3) wattle-impressed daub;
and 4) a midden accumulation. An Early Ceramic settlement was
not identified if a substantial Caddoan component other than
a cemetery was present. As noted in Table 8, an Early Ceramic
component was not identified at all if Early Caddoan diagnos­
tics were present. The manufacture of pottery classifiable as
Williams Plain is known to have continued into the Early
Caddoan period (Brown 1971). Contracting stem dart points
were not considered for purposes of defining the component
type, although probably a part of the Early Ceramic artifact
assemblage, as they could derive from a prior Late Archaic
component at any given site. Finally, a single mound center
(16C052) has been documented at which a single burial mound

quite similar to that at the Bellevue Site (Fulton and Webb
1953) occurred.
A simiLar but somewhat more diverse suite of functional
types was defined for the Caddoan components. Thresholds of
surface diagnostic recovery and site area were doubled on the
presumption that Caddoan settlements were probably occupied
for longer periods than Early Ceramic ones, as reliance on
horticuLture progressiveLy increased. It also seems likeLy
that the incidence of ceramic manufacture was higher in the
Caddoan components. Thus, a Caddoan "limited use area" is a
component from which fewer than 50 diagnostic sherds were
recovered from an area of Less than 2000 sq m. A "small
settlement ll is defined if any two of the following four
criteria are present: 1) 50 or more diagnostic sherdsj 2)
site area greater than 2000 sq m but less than 15,000 sq mj
3) wattle-impressed daub; and 4) a midden accumulation. If
200 or more diagnostic sherds have been recovered from an
area of 15,000 sq m or greater, and wattle-impressed daub or
midden acclIllUlations are present, a "large settlement" is
defined. A "mound center" is identified if one or more arti­
ficial earthen mounds is present. A "small cemetery" contains
fewer than 15 graves, and a "Large cemetery" contains 15 or
more. Various functional combinations (e.g. smaLL settlement
and small cemetery) have been noted.
One functional category of aboriginal site which was
typically difficult to assign to any more discrete time
period was defined. A "lithic procurement area" is a site
where abundant resources of lithic material suitable for tool
manufacture occur in association with primary stage of reduc­
tion lithic debris.
Another independent functional cLassification was estab­
lished for historic Anglo-American components. Three of these
categories are defined archeologically. A "domicile" is a
component at which the physical remains of a structure
(foundations, bricks, etc.) and a broad range of household
refuse have been noted. A "limited use area" is defined if no
structural remains were visible. A "cemetery" is identified
if graves were present. Four other functional categories have
been documented historically: "pottery ki In'', "iron foundry",
"military installation" and "townsite".
For components of all time periods, if the data were
insufficient to permit an assessment of intensity or func­
tion, a classification as "cooponent type unknown" was made.
It must be stressed that the criteria enumerated above
were designed for the interpretation of sites known only from
surface collections. Excavated sites were interpreted accord­
ing to the number of diagnostics recovered relative to the
percentage of the site excavated. For example, the recovery
of 21 Gary dart points from a particular site would not be
considered indicative of a heavy use area if 50% of the site
had been excavated. Naturally. any cultural features identi'
fied at excavated sites were taken into account in their
interpretations.
Again, even for surface sites, the criteria of
cation have been employed not as absolutes, but as
guidelines. In each case, the factors of land use,
of disturbance, topographic position and private

the condition of a given site is noted parenthetically. FOr
example, "Destroyed (1970)" indicates that the site was
reported destroyed in 1970.
5.5 Artifact Classification
To reduce the bulk of Table 9, ceramic vessel typologi­
cal names are abbreviated by dropping the decorative tech­
nique part of the name. For example, Karnack Brushed-Incised
is referred to simply as "Karnack". Where a single place
name has been used for more than one type, the first letters
of the respective techniques are added to differentiate them.
The names of ceramic types which are not of common occurrence
in the Cypress basin (e.g. 8etdeau Incised) or which do not
appear to be well known (e.g. Carmel Engraved) are always
stated in full to avoid potential confusion. Finally, if two
or more type names are listed, separated by a virgule (e.g.
Ripley/Taylor), the specimens in question exhibit traits of
both ceramic types, and could not be assigned to either with
confidence.
Where available, quantities are stated for each artifact
class. If none is stated, none was available. This is only a
problem where the data have been derived from a published
report. A parallel problem which merits comment is that, for
data derived from written sources, artifact class specificity
is limited to the level of detail and sophistication of that
source.
An asterisk appearing to the immediate right of a site
trinomial number in Table 9 indicates that most or all of the
artifact collection was classified by the author. Otherwise,
the data have been collected from the published reference(s)
listed and/or from documentation on file at TARL.
5.6 Site Condition
Seven categories have been devised to permit an abbrevi­
ated reporting of site condition in Table 9. "Undisturbed"
means that, at the time of the most recent documented visit
to the site, there were no visible signs of disturbance_ This
undoubtedly overestimates the occurrence of truly pristine
sites (if any such sites exist). At "disturbed" sites, at
least a part of the archeological deposit has clearly been
displaced by some natural or human agency (e.g. burrowing ro­
dents or plowing), but none of the deposit has been physical­
ly removed from the site. Even this lowest level of disturb­
ance will involve some translocation of artifacts and de­
struction of cultural features. A classification as "partial­
ly destroyed" indicates that a portion, but probably less
than 50% of the archeological deposit, has been physically
removed from the site, as through gully erosion or road fill
removal. "Largely destroyed" indicates the removal of a
majority of the depoSit, and "destroyed" its entire removal.
Sites which are now on the shorelines of reservoirs are
classified as destroyed. A separate category, "inundated",
has been established for sites which have been flooded by a
reservoir, and which lie below the elevation of the conserva­
tion pool (and thus, presumably, the effects of wave action).
It is not clear what damage inundation may do to a site if it
occurs rapidly. "Condition unknown" indicates that no infor­
mation regarding the condition of the site is available.

J. Dieckman reports collecting 5 Southwestern
sherds; 1 Gila PoLychrome, 1 Tonto Polychrome,
2 Maverick Mountain Redware (1 vessel); 1 Gary
dart point; 1 battered cobble; and 1 pitted
stone at the site in 1953. He also reports
observing Caddoan sherds at the time of this first
visit, but states he saw nothing on subsequent visits.
E. Mott Davis visited the site 9/30/60 and found no
artifacts, although the landowners reported finding
many in the past. Provenience of the Southwestern
sherds is therefore equivocal. If accurate,
however, their presence dates the reported Caddoan
component to the period A.D. 1250-1450.

1971: 41-56, 164-174; Webb and McKinney 1975.
Mounds Plantation was first visited by Clarence B. Moore
in 1911. Moore referred to the site as Pickett Landing. The
presence at that time of farm dwellings on all but one of the
mounds deterred any excavation therein. Testing of the sur­
face within the mound group was unfruitful (Moore 1912: 524­
525).

Most or all of the mounds were apparently rectangular in
plan, with steep sides and flat tops, at the time of Moore's
visit in 1911. Subsequent cultivation, removal 01 fill for
leveling and erosion have lowered their height (in some cases
radically), increased their horizontal dimensions, and al­
tered their shapes. It is not possible to estimate accurately
the original dimensions of most of the mounds. Moore recorded
the dimensions only of Mound " which was 50 x 70 meters at
the base and 5 meters high, and of Mound 2, which measured 45
x 45 x 3.5 meters (Moore 1912: 524·525). Since that time,
Mound 1 has been cut down to ca. 2 meters in height, and
roughly half of Mound 2 has been destroyed. The dimensions
reported for the other mounds by Webb and McKinney (1975: 42­
44) are as follows: Mound 3, 36 x 36 x 3 meters; Mound 4: 40
x 40 x 5 meters; Mound 5, 60 x 60 x 4 meters; Mound 6, 50 x

123

50 x.6 meters; Mound 7, 40 x 40 meters, height barely per­
ceptible; Mounds 8 and 9, 18 x 18 x .6 meters. Mounds 4, 6
and 7 had been drastically altered by the landowner prior to
the taking of these measurements. Mounds 3 and 5 have since
been destroyed. These last two are the mounds investigated by
Webb and Mcl< i nney •

and two intrusive Belcher phase single interments were iden­
tified (ibid.: 48-70). A summary of the floor dimensions,
individuals interred and grave offerings is provided in Table
10. This information has been adapted from webb and McKinney
(1975: 48-70). An asterisk (*) indicates the identification
of an apparent paramount individual within each burial.

The stratigraphy of Mound 5 can be interpreted as fol­
lows. A midden deposit underlaid the mound. The midden was
covered with 18-20 cm of red sandy clay loam by the aborigi­
nal occupants, and then Burial Pits 6 and 10-14 were excavat­
ed and filled. A primary mound 1.5 meters in height was
raised over the burials, with a core of red sandy clay loam
and a cap of compact red clay. Burial pits 1 and 5 were
excavated from the surface of the primary mound, and Mound 5
was enlarged to its final size. Burial Pits 2, 3 and 7-9 and
the two intrusive Belcher phase burials originated from this
surface. Webb and McKinney (ibid.: 121) point out that none
A single burial, that of a child, was found by IJebb in of the Coles Creek/Early Caddoan burial pits crosscut one

period was of relatively short term.
association was a plain ceramic vessel (ibid.: 45).

Of the three borrow pits, No. 1 is the largest, measur­
ing roughly 64 x 70 meters. It is subrectangular in plan.
Borrow Pits 2 and 3 are both oval in plan, and measure 40 x
75 meters and 37 x 50 meters, respectively. Webb found a
trash filled pit eroding from the east edge of Borrow Pit 1
in about 1950. The pit was about 50 cm in diameter and 30-45
cm in depth. Burned clay and charcoal were found at its base,
and the fill contained 440 sherds, mostly plain, and many
exhibiting the paste and thickness characteristics of the
type Williams Plain (ibid.: 44).

All other subsurface investigations conducted by Webb
and McKinney concentrated on Mounds 3 and 5. The landowner
began leveling Mound 3 in 1959 and struck a burial 60 cm
below the crest of the mound. McKinney was contacted, and
allowed to test the mound prior to its destruction. A trench
3.35 meters in width was cut through the center of the mound.
At a depth of 10 cm below the burial which had been de­
stroyed, a second was found, containing 1 individual and 5
ceramic vessels: 2 Belcher Ridged jars, 2 Hodges carinated
bowls, 1 Keno bottle and 1 highly polished deer mandible
(ibid.).

The 940 ceramic sherds and 55 arrow points and that have
been reported from the surface of Mounds Plantation are
included in Tables 11 and 12. Also collected from the surface
were 7 Red River pipe fragments (1 bowl, 6 stem); 23 miscel­
laneous bifaces; Z small polished stone chisels; 1 celt; 1
battered cobble; 2 polished pebbles; 7 Catahoula sandstone
tabular abraders; 1 pitted stone; 2 quartz crystal fragments
and 2 blue pigment fragments (ibid.: 44). The results of the
radiocarbon assays of three samples from Burial Pit 5 are
listed in Table 13.

Webb and McKinney bel ieve the primary cOfl1X>l1ent at
16CD12 relates to a period of transition from the lower
MissiSSippi valley Coles Creek culture to an Early Caddoan
one. The sequence of burials in Mound; and the stratigraphy
of Mound 3 certainly support that interpretation. In Mound 5,
Early Caddoan ceramics occur only in the burial pits excavat­
ed after the erection of the primary mound. The non-perisha­
ble grave offerings in the earLiest pits (BuriaL Pits 6 and
10-14) were relatively few in number, and the only chronolog­
ical diagnostics present were arrow points of the Coles Creek
period types CoLbert and Homan. Early Caddoan ceramics are
Most of the ceramics from Mound 3 are of Coles Creek and also more common in the upper midden of Mound 3 than in the

spot served as a center of ceremonial feasting during those
periods, with possibly two structures represented, one sub­
mound and one atop the mound. The Late Caddoan use of Mound 3
was apparently limited to the placement of burials in intru­
sive pits (Webb and McKinney 1975: 47).
The cross-section of Mound 3 revealed two dark, organi­
cally stained midden deposits, one premound and one atop the
mound. Both middens contained nunerous sherds and animal
bones. The remains of a structure, 14 meters in diameter and
surrounded by a low (70-90 cm high) embankment of earth,
overlaid the premound midden. The structure had a prepared
floor of white sand. Two major units of mound fill overlaid
the ruins of the structure, with no evidence of significant
time lapse between their deposition (ibid.; 46-47).

Late in 1959 the landowner began removing fill for use
in leveling from Mound 5. McKinney visited the site in Febru­
ary of 1960 and discovered the remains of a disturbed burial
associated with the fragments of a Belcher Ridged jar. An
agreement was reached to permit excavation of the mound,
which occurred from the fall of 1960 to the summer of 1961
(ibid.; 48).
Excavation of Mound 5 revealed that it had been used
solely as a receptacle for burials. Fifteen Coles Creek/Early
Caddoan burial pits, containing a total of 57 individuals,

The problem of the transition from Coles Creek to Early
Caddoan is glossed over in the chronology used in the present
study by lLlJlling the two together U1der the rubric of "Early
Caddoan" (Table 8). However, the reality of the transition is
strongLy indicated by the excavations at Mounds Plantation,
Mound Pond (41HS12: Table 9) and Crenshaw (Durham and Davis
1975: 1-10). An understanding of the relationship between the
lower Mississippi valley cultures and those of northeast
Texas during not only the CoLes Creek and Early Caddoan
periods, but also during the preceding period here referred
to as "Early Ceramic", is undoubtedly essential to an under­
standing of the development of Caddoan culture per see One is
led to suspect that many of the roots of Caddoan culture lie
along the Red River mainstem during the period 200 B.C. to
A.D. 800.

The chronology of structures and burials at the Belcher
site is summarized in Table 14, and descriptions of the
structures are provided in Table 15. Four basic structural
forms are suggested: 1) House 4: subrectangular in plan, with
vertical walls, a gabled roof and an extended entranceway; 2)
Houses 2, 6-8: circular in plan, with vertical walls, a
conical roof and an extended entranceway; 3) Houses 1, 5:
circular in plan, with vertical walls, a conical roof and no
extended entranceway; and 4) Houses 3A, 3B: oval in plan,
with the classic Caddoan conoidal form (c.f. Swanton 1942:
148-153) and no extended entranceway.

A UT crew under the direction of A.T. Jackson excavated
a cemetery and tested a nearby mound in May of 1931. A total
of nine graves was identified in a discrete cemetery (desig­
nated Area A on Figure 17) on a terrace remnant adjacent to
Greasy Creek. A summary of the contents of the graves is
provided in Table 22. The skeletal material had largely or
entirely decomposed in all of the graves, and no determina­
tions of age or sex were made. However, the dimensions and
orientations of the grave pits (not provided here) suggested
extended, supine inhumations aligned on east-west axes
(Jackson 1931b).

In addition to the specimens of grave-specific proven­
ience, the following artifacts were recovered in general
excavation or from the surface in Area A: 100 CaddOan sherds:
15 Ripley carinated bowl rim (including pendant triangle
motif), 3 Taylor carinated bowl rim, 1 Belcher E. bottle
body, 2 noded rattle bowl body, 2 Killough jar rim, 2 Bullard
jar rim, 1 Maydelle jar rim, 1 randomly punctated jar rim, 4
plain olla neck, 2 plain bowl rim, 3 Harleton body, 4 brushed
body, 47 plain body (many from pol ished vessels) and 13 plain
base; 1 Gary dart point preform; 1 crude, somewhat rectangu­
lar, very thick biface; 1 retouched flake and 1 unmodified
pebble. The chronological similarity of the sherds to the
whole vessels from the graves, and the dominance of the sherd
collection by engraved/polished and other speciality wares,
suggest that the sherds derive from grave vessels destroyed
by plowing. There are far too few utility ware sherds for
occupational debris. The lithic specimens probably derive
from a Late Archaic limited use of the terrace.
The UT crew also tested a small mound (designated Area B
in Figure 17) 400 meters to the northeast of the cemetery, on
the floodplain of Greasy Creek, directly adjacent to the
channel. This testing was very poorly documented, even by the
standards of the day. The horizontal dimensions of the mound
are not stated in Jackson's report, but it was apparently
relatively small, 1.5 meters high, and circular in plan. The
only feature encountered was a concentration of charcoal of
unstated dimensions, apparently also circular in plan, from
45 to 90 em (i.e., ca. 45 cm in thickness) below the surface
of the mound. This feature was apparently substantially
smaller than the mound in horizontal dimensions, and occupied
its southeast quadrant. Portions of a bowl were found within
the charcoal. This vessel is not specifically identified in
the collection, but there is an unprovenienced, fragmentary
Ripley Engraved carinated bowl exhibiting a carelessly ex­
cised version of a circle and nested triangle motif similar
in execution to a vessel from Burial 1 at 41UR1 (Sec.
6.3.7.1). It seems quite probable that the mound is of arti­
ficial origin and is substantially earlier than the cemetery
at 41CP2, possibly dating to the Whelan phase. In reference
to the mound, see the description of 41CP4 (Sec. 6.3.1.3).
One wonders if a cremated burial Like that documented in
Mound A at 41UR10 (Sec. 6.3.7.4) might be represented in Area
B of 41CP2.

The large number of ceramic vessels of the type RipLey
Engraved, the presence of types Bailey Engraved, Taylor
Engraved, Wilder Engraved, Harleton Applique and Karnack
Brushed-Incised, and the presence of Talco arrow points all
indicate a Titus phase origin for the cemetery. Burial 8
certainly stands out from the group in the character of its
inclusions, but it is not clear whether these differences are
attributable to chronologicaL or status-related factors. The

tion of his property. Jackson, Turner and R.R. Nicholas of
Daingerfield all attempted and failed to receive permission
to excavate.

6.3.1.2 41CP3*, George W. Rumsey Farm

The 12 vessels purchased by Jackson are now in the TARL
collections, and include the following: 4 Ripley carinated
bowls (2 continuous scroll motif, 1 interlocking horizontal
scroll motif and 1 circle and nested triangle motif), 1
Ripley globular jar (scroll and circle motif), 1 untyped
engraved carinated bowl, 1 untyped engraved compound bowl, 2
Maydelle jars, 1 untyped utility jar, 1 plain carinated bowl
and 1 plain simple bowl. Turner (1978: 93) reports his pur­
chased collection to contain vessels of the types Ripley
(including pendant triangle, scroll, scroll and circle,
continuous scroll and bisected diamond motifs), Taylor,
Wilder, Harleton, Killough, La Rue, Karnack, Bullard, Pease,
Maydelle, Haley E., Hardy, Canton, Dunkin and Pennington.
Without knowing grave associations, it is very difficult to
interpret this assemblage, but it is possible that Early
Caddoan Period 2, Whelan phase and Titus phase components are
all present. The number of graves exposed to date at the site
is not known, but one would assume that the 52 known ceramic
vessels represent at least five or six burials.
The occupation area is apparently 30 meters away from
the cemetery (direction unknown). Turner excavated a test pit
in this area and found sherds, non-human bones and freshwater
mussel shells up to one meter below the surface. Only the
surface collections made by Jackson in 1930 and Miller and
Moorman in 1951 were available to me at TARL. Turner has
retained his collection and has not yet published a descrip­
tion thereof. The two collections present at TARL had been
mixed and could not be entirely separated, and so are pre­
sented as a body: 157 Caddoan sherds: 4 Ripley carinated bowl
rim (2 pendant triangle, 2 scroll and circle motif), 6 sherds
from a large, red-slipped, shell-tempered compound bowl with
a Ripley-like scroll motif on the shoulder, 3 sherds from a
red-slipped Belcher E. bottle, 1 Ripley/Taylor carinated bowl
rim, 1 Taylor/Wilder bottle body, 3 Maydelle jar rim, 7
miscellaneous engraved bowl rim, 1 engraved and red-slipped
bowl rim, 1 red-slipped bowl rim, 1 incised and punctated jar

Very limited testing in a search for graves was per­
formed for UT by A.T_ Jackson in 1931. Three ceramic vessels
which had been exposed by erosion were purchased from the
landowner at that time. Three concentrations of surface mate­
rial were noted along a 500 meter span of Greasy Creek, in
close proximity to 41CP2. These have been designated Areas A,
B and C on Figure 17. The three ceramic vessels (1 Ripley
carinated bowl, pendant triangle motif, 1 Harleton jar and 1
Maydelle jar) are from Areas A and C, suggesting at least 1
burial in each area. There were discrete midden deposits in
Areas A and B, but their dimensions and the character of any
associated cultural material are not known. Jackson did not
test either midden. Dart points were found in Areas B and C.
The following artifacts are known to be from 41CP4, but
are of unknown intrasite provenience: 24 Caddoan sherds: 1
Harleton jar rim/body juncture, 1 plain bowl rim, 1 engraved
body, 1 punctated body, 7 brushed body, 11 plain body and 2
unclassified; 3 Gary dart points; 1 small, ovaloid biface and
1 large ferruginous sandstone biface.
On the basis of the artifact collection, it appears
there were Titus phase burials at 41CP4. The presence of the
two middens could suggest one contemporaneous or two non­
contemporaneous small settlements, relating either to the
nearby late Whelan phase cemetery at 41UR1 or to the Titus
phase cemetery at 41CP2 (Fig. 17). The proximity of 41CP4 to
the Whelan phase component at 41CP8, 2 km to the north, is
suggestive. At 41CP8, a midden in Area A and a lesser concen­
tration of surface material in Area D apparently accompany a
small mound in Area E. It is possible that these segments of
41CP8 on the one hand, and Areas A of 41CP2 and A and/or B of
41CP4 on the other, represent either paired, contemporaneous
nuclear centers on an equivalent sociopolitical level, or
sequent sites tracing the movement of such a center during
the Whelan phase. Such interpretations must remain specula­
tive at present.

1978.

Miller et al. 1951; Tunnell 1959b; Pearson et al. 1965;
E. Davis 1969: 54; Yyckoff 1971: 127-132; Turner 1978: 93.

R.L. Turner and R.W. Walsh removed 44 burials in con­
trolled excavations on weekends from May of 1963 to October
of 1967. Two additional graves were Looted by unknown private
coLLectors during the course of these excavations, and Turner
(p.c.) reports that Billy Jack Anderson of Mt. PLeasant
removed approximately 25 graves in the earLy 1970s. Thus,
roughly 70 graves are known to have existed.

E_O_ Miller and E.H. Moorman made an uncontrolled sur­
face collection in April of 1951. The mound was tested and
the occupation areas were individually surface collected by
E.M. Davis and C.D. TunneLL in November of 1957. Similarly
controlled surface collections were repeated by E.M. Davis in
1958. All of these investigations occurred under the auspices
of the Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir project.

A summary of the contents of the graves excavated by
Turner and Yalsh is provided in Table 23. No information
pertaining to the graves removed by the other individuals is
available. A radiocarbon assay of A.D. 1520-1660 (Tx-666) has
been obtained from a saqlle of woody charcoal associated with
Burial 10 (Valastro and Davis 1970). An excellent plan of the
cemetery is provided by Turner (1978: Fig. 3), and is not
reproduced here. All of the buriaLs were extended, supine,
oriented on a roughly east-west axis, and with the exception
of two double burials (Nos. 21 and 23), were singLe inter­
ments. Burial 19 contained a GaLt biface of non-Local chert,
measuring 22.2 x 4.5 em (thickness not stated by Turner),
nearly identical in form to those from 41HS3 (Burial 54) and
41FK2 (Burial 2).

A summary of the specimens recovered from 41CP8 is
provided in Table 24. The site is composed of five discrete
areas, designated A through E in Figure 17. Area A is a very
dense concentration of occupation debris on a floodplain rise
adjacent to Prairie Creek, associated with a dark brown
greasy soil. Large, dark outlines associated with concentra­
tions of wattle-impressed daub may mark the Locations of
structures. The number and size of these features has not
been recorded. Area D is a similar but smaller and much less
dense artifact concentration on the same floodplain rise as
Area A, 100 meters to the northeast (Tunnell 1959b: 10, 11,
14). The dimensions of the two areas have not been recorded,
but it appears from sketch maps of the site that Area A is
roughly 100 meters in diameter and that Area D is 70 meters
in diameter. The artifact collection from Area A appears to
contain materials relating to three components. Certainly a
small Late Archaic component is present. One could interpret
the Late Caddoan material in one of two ways: either as a
single late Whelan phase component; or as two components, one
Yhelan phase and one Titus phase. The presence in substantial
numbers of both Talco arrow points and RipLey pendant trian­
gle motif carinated bowl rims on the one hand, and of Perdiz
arrow points and Pease body sherds on the other, suggests to
me that the latter interpretation is more likely. Combina­
tions of these particuLar diagnostics do not occur at any of
the sites (listed in Fig. 14) which do appear to be late
~helan phase. It is therefore probable that small settlements
occupied Area A during both the Yhelan and Titus phases. The
high incidence of brushed sherds in Area 0 certainly demon­
strates that at least the bulk of the materials from the area
is Late Caddoan in origin. The only typologically classifia­
ble specimen is a single Pease sherd, but it seems quite
possible that Area D was used during both Late Caddoan compo­
nents, probably as an outdoor activity area.

Valastro and Davis 1970; Wyckoff 1971: 174-181;

Turner (1978: 9-11) believed there were two Titus phase
components at the site. His late component graves were marked
by the dominance of stemless Talco and Maud arrow points and
Ripley carinated bowls exhibiting the pendant triangle motif.
Early component graves contained mostly stemmed arrow points
of the types Bassett and Perdiz, classic Ripley bottles, and
Ripley carinated bowls exhibiting the horizontal diamond,
bisected diamond and interlocking horizontal scroll motifs.
The scroll and continuous scroll (the latter is termed trian­
gular by Turner) Ripley motifs appeared in graves of both
components, but were much more common in the earlier graves.
Yi lder Engraved bottles occurred in both components. As is
discussed in Chapter 7, the distinctions in material culture
ascribed to change through time by Turner seem more likely
attributable to factors of synchronic social group variation.

Assuming that the general east-west orientations of the
graves may reflect aboriginal use of the position of the sun
at sunset to determine the preCise cardinal orientation of
each grave, Turner (1978: 49-52) made a very reasonable
argument that most of the interments occurred in late winter,

At least three components can be identified at 41CP10:
1) a Middle Archaic limited use area; 2) a Middle Caddoan
cemetery; and 3) a Titus phase cemetery. The small settlement
could relate to either cemetery, or could represent another
separate component. This is an archeological site of regional
interpretive importance, and it is hoped that a more detailed
description of the 1967 TAS excavations will eventually be
published.

Problematic though the information may be, it is clear
from the artifact classification provided by Sullivan that
there were multiple components at the site; certainly Early,
Middle and Late Archaic, Early Caddoan and at least two Late
Caddoan components (Table 26). Complex though this mixture
may have been, the horizontal separation of the preceramic
and ceramic components and the presence of intact features
indicate that extensive excavation could have gone far to
sort out this complexity and identify the functional nature

surface or subsurface, from 41CP14. The site was a very northern edge of the terrace. The precise number of graves

found is not clear, but there seem to have been at least 35.
The graves were arranged in fairly regular north-south rows
of seven to eight per row, with the feet of each of the
interred to the west. Most of the graves were single inter­
ments, 1.8 to 2.4 meters in depth. However, the row closest
to the northern edge of the terrace (and thus the creek) was
composed of five or six deep shaft graves, ranging from 3.7
to 5.5 meters in depth. All of these were multiple inter­
ments.
Herrington was able to obtain detailed information on
one such grave. The pit was about 4 meters deep and measured
3.0 x 2.5 meters at its floor. Three individuals lay side-by­
side in extended, supine position on a floor covered with a
layer of white sand. Grave offerings placed around the in­
terred included numerous ceramic vessels of the types Ripley
Engraved and other Titus phase types, large caches of Maud
and Bassett arrow points, several petaloid celts and biconi­
cal ceramic pipes, caches of lithic debitage and a Galt
biface ca. 20 cm in length. The latter was associated with
the central individual. According to several sources, all of
the deep graves contained such a biface, 20 to 23 cm in
length, of non-local chert. None of the single interments
contained a Galt biface.
Herrington viewed another grave shaft soon after excava­
tion, but after removal of the grave goods, ~ich measured
3.7 (E-W) x 1.8 (N-S) x 3.7 meters. This grave also was
reported to have contained three individuals and numerous
offerings, including a Galt biface. One collector informed
her that he had excavated a third pit which was 4.3 meters in
depth and 3.1 x 2.4 meters in horizontal dimensions at the
floor, but would relate no further details.
These collectors are probably fortunate to have survived
their digging at the site. The alluvium composing the terrace
was a fine stream-sorted sand extending in excess of 10
meters below the surface. For the sake of speed, at least one
shaft grave was looted by first removing the plowzone to
locate the grave pit outline, then excavating a narrow shaft
about a meter in diameter to the base of the pit, some 5
meters below the surface. From that point, the collector
tunneled horizontally to obtain the grave goods. On one of
her visits to the site, Herrington caught two collectors in
full swing. It was late in the day. and presuming the two
would soon be forced by nightfall to cease work, she informed
them that if found present the next morning, they would be
arrested and prosecuted. The two left the site, procured
Coleman lamps, and returned to work throughout the night in a
driving rain to clear the second of the shafts described
above (3.7 meters in depth).

and character of these additional specimens is not known.
The contents of these three graves indicate a Titus
phase affiliation. There is not sufficient information re­
garding the contents of the other graves to rule out the
possibility that there may also have been Whelan phase buri­
als in the cemetery. However, all sources agree that no Early
Caddoan material was recovered from any grave.
At the least, then, three components can be identified
at 41CP17: 1) a Middle Archaic limited use area: 2) a Whelan
phase settlement; and 3) a Titus phase cemetery. Given the
quantity of the Archaic material recovered from a very simi­
lar topographic setting at the nearby 41TT110, it is quite
possible that there were substantial and multiple Archaic
components buried deep below the surface.

The locations of these test pits within the site were not determinable from the records available to me. The specimens from the grade-all trenches were
collected from the tops of the backdirt piles, as this material was not screened. Wondering why I bothered to sort this out by excavation unit? I give up.

* The Ripley Engraved carinated bowl rims include the scroll, scroll & circle and interlocking horizontal scroll motifs. Many of the Ripley Engraved and other
engraved sherds exhibit the carelessly-executed curvilinear hatchures characteristic of Whelan phase contexts.

vations were not sufficiently extensive to detect the fea­
tures present. Three components can be detected in the arti­
fact collection: 1) a Middle Archaic limited use area; 2) an
Early Ceramic limited use area; and 3) a Late Whelan phase
small settlement.
6.3.1.10 41CP27*, Lilly Creek

D. Laden of Pittsburg has repeatedly made uncontrolled
surface collections from this large (ca. 100,000 sq m) prec­
eramic site on his grandfather's property. I recorded his
collection of lithic tools from the site in 1978, with the
assistance of students in the UT field school at Benson's
Crossing. The Laden collection contains a total of 426 speci­
mens: 364 dart points: 161 Gary, 20 Kent, 2 Elam, 2 untyped
straight stem, 18 Edgewood, 10 Ellis, 5 Lone Oak, 12 Palmil­
las, 3 Pedernales, 5 Trinity, 66 Yarbrough, 2 Wesley, 7
untyped expanding stem, 4 Bulverde, 3 Calf Creek, 1 Carroll­
ton, 10 Morrill, 20 Wells, 2 Dawson, 1 stemless triangular, 1
Plainview, 4 Meserve, 1 Folsom-like and 4 miscellaneous
untyped; 1 Pogo stemmed biface; 12 ovalold blfaces; 14 sub­
triangular bifaces; 12 bifaces of irregular shape; 22 dart
point or other biface blade fragments; and 1 prismatic blade
(probably Paleoindian) exhibiting edge retouch. Laden did not
collect lithic debitage or ground stone tools. There are no
ceramics or arrow points at the site. Components dating from
the Early and Late Paleoindian and Early, Middle and Late
Archaic periods are indicated. The site was undoubtedly
subjected to repeated use during all three periods of the
Archaic.

The following specimens were incidentally recovered in
the search for graves: 85 Caddoan sherds: 12 Ripley carinated
bowl rim (including the scroll, scroll and circle and contin­
uous scroll motifs), 5 Harleton jar body, 1 Killough jar rim,
3 La Rue jar rim, 1 randomly punctated jar rim, 3 plain jar
rim, 3 engraved body, 3 punctated body, 2 fingernail im­
pressed body, 1 appliqued body, 3 brushed body, 43 plain body
and 5 plain base; 1 Reserve or Tularosa Corrugated Ware body
sherd; 1 petaloid celt poll fragment; 1 battered and abraded
cobble; 1 pitted stone and 1 unmodified cobble. The corrugat­
ed body sherd is diagnostic of the Reserve or Tularosa phases
of the MogoLlon area, dating A.D. 1000-1300 (D. Robinson, p.
c.). Given that no screening was done and that these speci­
mens represent incidental recoveries, it is possible that a
small Caddoan settlement was present. The composition of the
ceramic collection would suggest an occupation contemporane­
ous with the Titus phase cemetery.
The presence of the Southwestern sherd is problematic.
Its chronoLogical placement is at least 300 years earlier
than I wouLd expect the Titus phase to date. It is of course
possible, given the somewhat haphazard curation histories of
the old UT collections, that the sherd was erroneously placed
in the 41FK2 coLlection at some point in the past. The non­
mortuary specimens were not documented by Jackson, and it is
not possible to verify the provenience of the corrugated
sherd. Two components may be then identified at the site: 1)
a single Early Caddoan Period 1 grave; and 2) a Titus phase
small cemetery and possibLe small settlement.

skeletal material remained in any of the graves, but the
dimensions of the pits suggested single, extended interments
(Jackson 1931a).

SUMMARY OF GRAVE GOODS

Burial 1
1) large bottle with a tall, tapering neck, an ovaloid body
and a broad, flattened base. Nine fine engraved horizontal
lines encircle the upper extremity of the neck. The upper
third of the body is raised 3-4 mm in a four-sided area which
appears square when viewed from above; this area is covered
by randomly distributed, tiny punctations. The rest of the
body is plain.
2) Small Hickory jar with a spheroidal body and a tall,
cylindrical neck. Groups of fine engraved horizontal Lines
encircLe the upper body (6) and the upper extremity of the
neck (4). The remainder of the exterior surface is plain and
polished.

3) Petaloid celt.
Burial 2
1) Spiro carinated bowl with an inverted, convex-waLled rim,
a thinned and squared Lip and a spheroidal body. The motif is
one of opposed concentric haLf circles.
2) A plain carinated bowl, simiLar in form to number 1.
3) A Spiro bottle with short, tapering neck, ovaloid body,
and broad, flattened base. The body is covered by alternating
concentric circle and nested triangle motifs in a complex
design.
4) A pLain, inverted-rim, conoidal jar with broad,
base and squared lip.

1) A Williams Plain-like jar with an inverted rim, a conoidal
body, and a broad, flattened and extended base. Three care­
lessly-executed horizontal incised lines encircle the rim;
the body is plain and unevenly burnished. The vessel is quite
heavy for its size due to the very thick, extended base.

2) A Hickory jar with taLL,

cylindrical neck, spheroidal
body, and broad, flattened base. Seven horizontal engraved
lines encircle the neck, evenly spaced to cover it. A singLe
2rai Led line demarcates the neck/body boundary. The body is
pLain and burnished. Two opposing suspension holes have been
drilLed through the upper neck.
3) Miniature everted-rim jar with thinned lip and globular
body. Two carefully-executed horizontal incised lines (not
overhanging) encircle the rim. A row of dentate punctates
made through a trailed line marks the rim/body boundary. The
body is plain and burnished_

4} Spiro spheroidaL bowl with an exterior-collared, vertical
rim and two opposing rim tabs. Horizontal engraved lines
encircle the rim, and the rim/body boundary is marked by a
single trailed Line. The body is divided into panels by
groups of vertical engraved lines, and each panel is bifur­
cated by a group of diagonal lines, with concentric semicir­
cles to either side.

Jackson 1934d; Turner 1978: 93.
Jackson completely excavated a cemetery in Area A and
excavated about 20% of a midden in Area B in June of 1934.
The structure of the site is iLlustrated in Figure 19. There
were 11 graves, all oriented roughly east-west. The skeletal
material had largeLy or entirely decomposed in aLL of the
graves. A classification of the contents of the graves is
presented in Table 32. The ceramics and arrow points from
mortuary context would indicate a Titus phase origin for the
cemetery. Jackson apparently excavated a sufficiently Large
area to estabLish the extent of the cemetery with a fair
degree of certainty. One grave, Burial 7, had been partially
looted by the tenant farming the land at that time. Large
quantities of charcoal were mixed into the fills of seven
graves_ The charcoal was definitely in secondary context
(Jackson 1934d).
Again, of the two middens (Fig. 19), onLy that in Area B
was investigated and described. It apparently formed a low
rise 15 meters in diameter and one meter high at the center.
The soil of the midden was dark and greasy with decomposed
organic matter, and it contained numerous sherds and large
quantities of charcoal, ash, burned clay and faunal material
(ibid.).

The number and character of specimens removed by the tenant are not known.

Five 60 cm wide trenches were excavated through the Area
B midden to the top of the argillic horizon, a11 on an east­
west axis. The average depth of the deposit was 75 cm. A
trash fi lled pit 104 cm deep and 60 Cm in diameter was found
beneath the center of the midden. It contained ash, charcoal,
sherds and faunal material. It seems possible that this
feature was a centerpost, and that the outline of a structure
underlay the midden. The excavations did not expose a suffi­
ciently broad area to permit the identification of the post­
holes of the structural wall, if such existed (ibid.).
The specimens recovered from the midden can be classi­
fied as follows: 576 Caddoan sherds: 27 Ripley carinated bowl
rim (scroll, continuous scroll, scroll and circle and alter­
nating nested triangle motifs); 1 Avery compound bowl shoul­
der, 28 miscellaneous engraved rim (most probably from Ripley
bowls), 1 red-slipped and engraved bowl rim, 9 Maydelle jar
rim, 6 miscellaneous incised jar rim, 6 punctated jar rim, 3
punctated and appliqued jar rim, 3 fingernail-impressed jar

A burial was exposed by erosion in the spring of 1931
and emptied of its contents by the landowner. Her use of a
hoe to this end apparentLy destroyed all but two of the
vessels in the grave (original total is unknown), and the
fragments of the others were discarded. M.M. Reese of UT
purchased the two remaining vessels in May of 1931, and
excavated a broad area around their source in a search for
additional graves. Only one was found, apparently quite close
to the location of the first. The known contents of the
graves are summarized in Table 33.

Jackson (1934d) reports, but did not collect, bones of
deer, turkey, rabbit, squirrel, raccoon, tortoise and turtle,
freshwater mussel shells and charred hardwood nuts in the
midden. Present in the collection, but of unknown intrasite
provenience, are 16 dart points: 11 Gary, 1 Kent, 1 Yar­
brough, 1 Calf Creek and 2 blade fragments; 1 small, ovaloid
biface; 2 retouched flakes; 3 abraded cobbles and 1 pitted
stone. Early to Late Archaic limited use of the site is thus
suggested.

The ceramic vessels are quite similar to those from
41FK2, 41FK4 and 41TT111 in execution of the border elements
on the Ripley bowls, and in the paste characteristics, wall
thickness and decorative details of the Harleton jars. None
of the vessels exhibited any brushing.

The ceramics from the cemetery and the midden are quite
similar, and it is likely that the two are contemporaneous.
The character of the utility ware from both contexts is
striking; brushed vessels are conspicuously rare for so late
a component. By far the most common utility vessels are: 1)
Harleton jars with punctated or roughened rims and appliqued
chevrons on the upper part of the body, which is otherwise
plain; and 2) an everted rim jar with punctated or incised
rim and plain body, quadrated by four vertical applique
fillets, similar to the type McKinney Plain. Although the
samples are much smaller, this also seems to be the case in
the Titus phase components at 41FK2 and 41TT11', also in the
far northwestern extremity of the basin. Comparative informa­
tion on such a detailed level is difficult to come by in this
section of the basin, as most of the work has been done by
SMU. However, this appears to be a spatial pattern, and not a
chronological one.

On the basis of this information, four components can be
identified at 41FK5: 1) a Late Pateoindian limited use area;
2) a Middle Archaic limited use area; 3) a Late Archaic
limited use area; and 4) a Titus phase small cemetery.

The following specimens were recovered as isolated finds
in the course of the excavations: 9 dart points: 2 Gary, 1
Kent, , Palmillas, 3 Yarbrough and 2 Meserve; 3 miscellaneous
bifaces and 1 pitted stone.

6.3.2.5 41FK7*, P.G. Hightower Farm
Jackson 1934b.
A tenant cultivating the land in 1934 reported plowing
up ceramic vessels in two spots and a human skeleton in a
third. The character of the vessels is not recorded. Jackson
excavated a broad area in the vicinity of these contacts, and
found three burials. The unusual nature of the graves war­
rants a detailed description of each.

158

Burial 1
Depth: 66 cm at the head, 74 em at the hips and 51 em at
the feet. Horizontal dimensions at grave floor: length = 150
em, width at shoulders = 38 cm, width at feet = 18 cm. The
interred was extended and supine, with the feet pointing
east-northeast. The skull exhibited occipital deformation.
Condition of the skeletal material ranged from poor to very
poor, and the ribs, carpals, tarsals and phalanges had com­
pletely disintegrated. The only fairly definite inclusion was
a hematite concretion of the size and character used in
grooved axe manufacture. A pit had been abraded into the
center of one face of this stone, but its smooth surface had
subsequently been interrupted by numerous shallow scratches,
extending beyond but concentrated upon the central depres­
sion. Nineteen chert flakes and a small hematite pebble were
found scattered through the grave filL, but could be inciden­
tal inclusions or the result of rodent disturbance. A large
sherd was found above the grave, but sufficiently close to
the surface to have been in the plowzone. The tenant plowed
up a ceramic vessel and a metal arrow point above the grave,
but these also cannot be considered definite associations.
Nothing is recorded concerning the sherd and vessel, but the
arrow point is in the TARL collections. It is made from a
thin piece of iron, is diamond-shaped in outline, and meas­
ures 3.5 x 1.9 x .2 cm. The distal third of the specimen
exhibits beveled edges produced by grinding. Again, it was
merely found on the surface above Burial 1 and can by no
means be considered in reliable association.

Burial 2
TotaL depth of the feature was 117 cm. From 69 to 76 cm
below the surface a layer of tabular, soft, hematitic sand­
stone fragments was found. The stones were Laid flat and
contiguous in a mosaic pattern, so as to form a pavement 1.75
meters (M-S) x 1.98 meters (E-Y), roughly circular in plan.
There were 748 of these stones, ranging in size from 2.5 x
2.5 x 1.3 cm to 15.2 x 10.2 x 3.8 cm. The material is more
specifically a poorly consolidated ferruginous sandy clay,
bright red in color. Numerous small fragments of charcoaL
were found inmediateLy above and below the rock layer. Two
Gary dart points, 1 Yarbrough dart point, 2 dart point blade
fragments and 1 retouched fLake were found scattered through
the feature fill, but could certainly be incidental inclu­
sions or rodent introduced. Disturbed fill extended 41 cm
below the rock layer, but was cuLturally sterile, and no
skeletal material (human or otherwise) was found. Although
Jackson labeled this feature a buriaL, its actual function
cannot be determined. One might note that it seems curious
that the pit should have been excavated and backfilled the
extra 41 cm, if the only purpose of the stones was to line a
utilitarian pit of some sort.

animal bones. One of the Latter was a deer ulna in the early
stages of awl manufacture. Also found in the grave fill were
2 bifaces and 3 pitted stones.
The following specimens were recovered as isolated finds
from the surface and excavations: 2 plain ceramic pipe frag­
ments; 1 CatahouLa arrow point; 31 dart points: 17 Gary, 1
Edgewood, 1 Elam, 1 lone Oak, 1 Yesley, 1 Yilliams, 2 Yar­
brough, 2 untyped expanding stem, 1 Bulverde, 1 lange, 1
Morrill, 1 Wells and 1 San Patrice; 1 small, tabular celt; 1
Clear Fork gouge; 13 bifaces; 1 uniface; 1 retouched flake; 4
abraded cobbles; 1 abraded slab; 8 pitted stones; 2 abraded
tool fragments and 4 hematite pigment stones. Jackson (1934b)
notes the presence of sherds on the surface in at least two
portions of the site, but none were collected.
The isolated finds suggest a late Archaic heavy use and
late Paleoindian, Early Archaic, Middle Archaic and Caddoan
limited use of the site. It is possible the ceramics noted by
Jackson derived from the Caddoan component. Chronological
placement of the three features described above cannot be
made. Given the crudity of excavation techniques and documen­
tation during the 19305, one cannot be certain of the associ­
ations of such small objects as dart points, bifaces and
pitted stones on a site with substantial preceramic compo­
nents. It is certainly possible that one or more of the
features are of Archaic origin, but this cannot be conclu­
siveLy demonstrated. The metal arrow point found in the
vicinity of Burial 1 must be considered an isolated find, and
its cultural origin is problematic. The specimen could cer­
tainly relate to a European contact period aboriginal limited
use of the site, and not necessarily by a Caddoan-speaking
group. Various displaced groups are known to have traversed
northeast Texas in the late 1700s and early 1800s.

6.3.2.6 41FK32*, A.D. Stocks Site
Sullivan 1975: 50.
The site was recorded by T. Harrington and M. Wendorf of
SHU in January of 1975 during the Bob Sandlin Reservoir
survey. Three burials were located by probing and excavated
by Mr. Stocks and his children in the early 1970s. I record­
ed the contents of two of the graves with the assistance of
several UT students in 1978. A description of the grave goods
is presented in Table 34. The burials were single interments,
extended and supine, with the feet oriented to the west. The
site was intensively probed, so it is likely that few or no
additional graves were present.

Burial 3
The pit was 94 em deep and measured 53 x 31 cm at the
floor. It contained a bundle of the disarticulated bones of a
human child, 10-12 years of age, intermixed with various

All of the vessels from both graves are grog-tempered.
Specimen 3 in Burial 1 and Specimens 4 and 8 in Burial 2 are
nearly identical to vessels 2-4 at 41TT36.

4) Untyped bottle with short, slightly flaring neck; tall, ovaloid body and flat, well-defined base. Body divided into four
panels by vertical excised lines, each containing a carelessly-engraved interlocking scroll motif of unique design. In each
panel, the space between the scroll is bifurcated by a single line, and in three panels discoid or circular elements float
within this space. Three of the circular elements contain equal-arm crosses. The scroll arms are outlined by heavy, careless
excising and contain numerous hourglass-shaped elements filled with curvilinear hachures. Elements of these designs could be
considered prototypical of the types Ripley Engraved and Wilder Engraved. The exterior is polished.

Burial 2
1) Cluster of arrow points, 3 Perdiz, 1 Scallorn; all pointed toward foot of grave, suggesting a quiver of arrows alongside
body.

2) Yarbrough dart point with distal end smoothed from use.
3) Plain, globular jar with everted, concave-walled, peaked rim; spheroidal body; poorly-defined base. Inflection between rim
and body quite curvilinear, lip rounded. Exterior surface burnished.
4) Plain, inverted-rim bowl with two opposing rim tabs and flat, well-defined base. Convex-walled rim curves
body with no clear break between the two. Exterior surface is polished.

5) Ripley bottle with tall, columnar neck; biconical body with sharp inflection between upper 2/3 and lower 1/3; flat, well­
defined base. The motif which occurs four times on the upper body is one of two nested, vertical rectangles, each carefully
cross-hatched at the corners to form a negative diamond. Exterior surface is polished. Design quite similar to Ripley hori­
zontal diamond carinated bowl motif.
6) Plain compound bowl with thinned lip; tall, everted, peaked rim; very short and poorly-defined shoulder; tall, conoidal
body; and flat, broad, well-defined base. The inflection and carination demarcating the shoulder are quite curvilinear.
Exterior surface is well-smoothed.
7) Plain carinated bowl with rounded lip; four opposing rim tabs; short, vertical rim; poorly defined carination;
conoidal body and poorly defined, convex base. Exterior surface is poorly smoothed.

8) Plain compound bowl with rounded lip; short, everted rim; very short, barely perceptible shoulder; tall, globular body;
convex, poorly defined base. Inflection at base of rim is angular, but shoulder/body carination is quite curvilinear. Exteri­
or surface is well-smoothed.
9) Plain cylindrical jar with rounded lip and flat, weLL-defined base. Virtually identical in form to Specimen 3 in Burial 1.
Exterior surface is poorly-smoothed.

The burials were found in an area of occupation debris,
about 10,000 sq m in areal extent, on a floodplain rise
bordering Stouts Creek. Little is known regarding the occupa­
tion debris, but the SMU survey form reports that 50 or more
incised, punctated and plain sherds, 1 biface, 23 flakes and
chips and 2 bone fragments were observed by Harrington and
Wendorf in 1975. Of the sherds from the surface at 41TT36,
93.8% were incised, punctated or plain. The Caddoan occupa­
tion at 41FK32, probably a small settlement, is almost cer­
tainly contemporaneous with the burials, and this component
may be slightly later than the small settlement at 41TT36
(Figs. 12 and 13). I believe these components trace the early
stage of transition from Early to Late Caddoan in the Cypress
basin, and thus relate to the Middle Caddoan period.

6.3.2.7 41FK35*
The site was recorded by D.A. Story and
in May of
1978. D.W. Lindley of Pittsburg and another private collector
conducted uncontrolled excavations at the site from April to
June of 1978. Lindley donated the bulk of his collection to
UT in 1978; I recorded the portion he retained.

Mr. Lindley encountered a midden deposit of dark, greasy
soil, containing numerous sherds and other specimens. He also
reported that a second collector found two graves. Each was a
single interment, extended and supine, with the feet oriented
to the west. The two graves together contained 1 Ripley
bottle, 1 Avery compound bowl, several plain carinated bowls
and Maud arrow points.

Lindley's collection contained material from the surface
and from both midden and non-midden excavated contexts. He
could not separate the materials by context, so the summary
of his collection which follows includes all three: 117
Caddoan sherds: 4 rim sherds from a Simms shouldered bowl, 1
Ripley carinated bowl rim (scroll motif), 1 Maydelle jar rim,
3 fingernail-impressed jar rim (1 vessel), 1 punctated jar
rim, 1 brushed and fingernail-impressed jar rim, 2 brushed
jar rim (1 vessel), 1 sherd from a peaked-rim jar with a
zoomorphic appendage, 2 plain rim, 1 engraved body, 2 finger­
nail-impressed body, 1 fingernail-impressed and brushed body,
1 fingernail-impressed and appliqued body, 1 Harleton body, 2
appliqued body, 7 brushed body, 1 red-slipped body, 72 plain
body, 6 plain base and 7 unclassified; 2 wattle-impressed
daub fragments; 3 arrow points: 2 Alba and 1 Maud; 22 dart
points: 7 Gary, 4 Kent, 1 Ellis, 6 Yarbrough, 1 Morrill, 1
Meserve and 2 blade fragments; 19 unmodified flakes and
chips; 1 tabular celt; 1 grooved axe; 1 battered quartz
crystal; 1 grooved abrader, 3 burned rock fragments; 10 bone
fragments and 2 shell fragments.

A cemetery was partially looted by private collectors in
1930. The remainder was excavated for UT by a crew under the
direction of B_B_ Gardner and A.T. Jackson in 1931. The UT
crew excavated 64 graves, and the collectors had found seven,
so a total of 71 is known to have existed (note that the
cemetery at 41CP5 also contained about 70 graves). A plan of
the graves excavated by UT appears as Figure 20, and a sum­
mary of the contents of those graves is presented in Table
35. The position of the site within the Cypress basin is
shown in Figure 15.
Eleven of the vessels procured by the collectors were
photographed by Jackson: 3 Ripley carinated bowls (2 pendant
triangle and 1 continuous scroll motif), 1 Ripley shouldered
jar (continuous scroll motif), 1 Taylor carinated bowl, 2
Taylor bottles, 2 Wilder bottles, 1 Harleton jar and 1 plain
bottle.
The graves excavated by UT had been placed in a cluster,
densest near its center, some 25 x 40 meters in area (Fig.
20). All were oriented roughly east-west. Skeletal material
was largely or entirely decomposed, but, where possible to
determine, the interments were uniformly single, extended,
supine and oriented with the feet to the west. Grave pits
seldom cross-cut one another, suggesting fairly short term
use, and possibly the use of perishable grave markers (wood
or mounded earth?). Grave length, width and depth ranged from
75 to 285 cm (mean = 180, sd = 50), 50 to 130 cm (mean = 85,
sd = 20), and 45 to 160 cm (mean = 110, sd = 108), respec­
tively. Thus, grave width and depth exhibit a fair degree of
uniformity, and grave length presumably varied with the
height of the interred. The floors of many of the graves were
covered with a layer of grayish-white sand, as deep as 15 cm,
often reaching its maximum depth below the head of the in­
terred (this practice has also been documented at 41UR2).

The number, kind and quality of non-perishable offerings
varied considerably from grave to grave, and most of the
differences appear to be attributable to status distinctions
based on age and sex. There is no sharp dichotomy of mortuary
treatment on a scale comparable to that at 41CP17. Given the
paucity of preserved skeletal material, it is possible to
conclusively determine the age and sex of the interred in
only a few cases. Burials 41, 50 and 61 were children, Burial
52 an adolescent, Burial 53 an adult female and Burials 12,
14, 15, 44-45, 47, 51 and 60 were adults of unidentified sex
(Jackson 1931e). However, I have attempted to reconstruct the
age and sex composition of the cemetery, based on a few
assumptions about the grave goods. Clusters of arrow points
at the side of the body, all parallel to one another and to
the longitudinal axis of the body, suggest quivers of hafted
arrows, which one would expect to accompany an adult male

FIGURE 20. 41HS3, H.R. TAYLOR FARM. The site is a large Titus Phase cemetery near Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir. A
summary of the contents of the graves is presented in Table 35. The classification of graves illustrated in this
plan is hypothetical, as explained in the text. Seven additional burials were looted by collectors, but their
locations and contents were not recorded. Adapted from Jackson 1931e.

graves containing five or fewer vessels and few other offer­
ings could be interpreted as those of adolescents of either
sex. A classification of the graves according to these crite­
ria produces a count of 26 adult males, 25 adult females, 8
adolescents and 3 children (Fig. 20). Burials 52 and 53 are
correctly classified by this scheme. This is all undoubtedly
an oversimplification, but the composition inferred is a
reasonable one, and correlates well with that of 41CP5 where
skeletal preservation was much better.

components. As is further discussed in Chapter 7, we can
begin to suggest the identification of subsidiary social
groups within the Titus phase on the basis of such differ­
ences in the ceramics.

Two graves suggest status differentiation of another
order. Burial 45 was one of the largest in the cemetery,
measuring 236 x 104 cm. in horizontal dimensions at the floor,
and contained by far the largest number of offerings of any
grave in the cemetery. The presence of an undoubtedly traded
Keno bottle of exceptional quality, very well-made arrow
points of non-local materials and a quartz crystal further
distinguish the grave from its neighbors. From what little
skeletal material remained, it is impossible to determine
whether Burial 45 was a single or double interment. The size
of the grave pit and the number and character of offerings is
certainly similar to that of Burials 21 and 23 at 41CP5, both
double burials (Turner 1978: Fig. 8, 32-35).

Webb (1948: 123, 125) analyzed a sample of 237 sherds
from the site and found 29.8% to be diagnostic of the Bossier
phase, 5.2% diagnostic of the Early Caddoan period and 65.0%
chronologically non-diagnostic. The Bossier phase diagnostics
were sherds of the types Maddox E. (.8%), Taylor (2.0%),
Pease (27.0%), "Dunkin Incised, late Variant" (14.3%) and
"Maddox Brushed" (41%). The "Dunkin" sherds are from everted­
rim jars with complicated pattern incised rims, and many are
probably assignable to the types Maydelle and Pease.

The survey found 14 Caddoan sherds: 2 red-slipped body,
2 incised body, 1 appL iqued body, 2 brushed body and 7 plain
body; and 1 wattle-impressed daub fragment. The excavations
encountered numerous posthoLes, a trash-filled pit and a
possible hearth. No posthoLe patterns were recognized. A
large collection of artifacts and associated materials was
recovered: 3687 Caddoan sherds: 4 Ripley carinated bowL rim
(scrolL motif), 1 Taylor carinated bowL rim, 18 engraved rim
(many probabLy Ripley), 1 zoomorphic effigy bowl rim, 30

points: 1 Bonham, 2 Perdiz, 1 Bassett, 1 crude untyped and 1

fragment. Apparently many of the incised, punctated and
incised, punctated and brushed, incised and appliqued,
brushed and appliqued and brushed body sherds are classifia­
ble as Pease (~. Davis 1961).
Despite the inability of the excavators to identify any
structural outlines, the size of the collection and the
presence of wattle-impressed daub suggest a settlement. The
area of the site was recorded as about 15,000 sq m on the
Miller and Moorman survey form, but the problem of site
boundaries was not addressed by subsequent investigations. It
is possible that a fairly large settlement is represented,
and the character of the coLlection suggests a singLe Whelan
phase component. Given the absence of Archaic diagnostics,
the paucity of lithic specimens in general is intriguing. The
site is less than 2 km northwest of the Whelan phase mound
center at 41MR2, and it seems extremely likely that the two
are contemporaneous and related. It is unfortunate that 41MR1
couLd not have been more fully investigated.

known area of occupation around the mounds lay to the immedi­
ate southeast of Mound A, covering an area of approximateLy
2000 sq m.
The excavations concentrated on Mound A, its associated
occupation area, and Mound B. Mounds C and D were not inves­
tigated. Mound A contained the remains of four superimposed,
circular structures (designated Houses A-D) without extended
entranceways and apparently with no interior features other
than central hearths and centerposts. All four structures
were presumably of the classic Caddoan conoidal form de­
scribed in early European accounts (Swanton 1942: 148·154).
The diameters of the structures were as follows: House A: 5.2
meters; House B: 5.8 meters; House C: 6.0 meters; and House
D: 6.4 meters. House D was constructed on the original flood­
plain floor. Subsequent structures originated at higher
Levels in the mound due to occupationaL accumuLations of soiL
and ash, and not as the result of any deLiberate capping. The
destruction of House A, the latest, was accompanied by some
burning and was followed by the placement of a relatively
steriLe earth cap to form the final, rounded surface of the
mound. The depth of accumuLation of occupational debris
prior to final capping suggests that each structure was used
for quite some time prior to its repLacement by a subsequent
structure (E. Davis 1958: 23-33).
Two structures (designated Structures
and 2) were
identified on the fLoodplain floor to the immediate southeast
of Mound A. Structure 1 was a small (3.1 meters in diameter),
circuLar affair, with no discernible entrance gap and no
interior features. Davis (1958: 34-35) has interpreted the
posthole pattern as the foundation of an elevated granary.
Structure 2 was also circuLar in plan, but was much larger
than Structure 1, measuring 7.9 meters in diameter. There was
no extended entrance, and the position of the entrance is not
known. Interior features included several isolated postholes,
two trash filled pits and a central hearth underlain by a
posthole. There was a deep (ca. 30 em) accumulation of dark
brown midden deposit on the floor of the structure which
contained numerous sherds and bone fragments. It is likely
that the midden derives from use of the structure for trash
disposal after its abandonment (but while it was yet stand­
ing), as the deposit was entirely within its perimeter.
Structure 2 has been interpreted as a domicile (ibid.: 36­
38).

Four components can be identified on the basis of the
preceding data: 1) a Middle Archaic limited use area: 2) a
Late Archaic heavy use area: 3) a Whelan phase small mound
center and small settlement and 4) an Early Historic Anglo­
American limited use area. There are three Whelan phase
components within 2 Km of 41MR2: 41MR1, a relatively large
settlement; 41MR32, a limited use area: and 41MR33, a small
settlement (Fig. 21). Further, 41MR2 and 41UR10 are quite
similar to one another in site plan, topographic location and
apparent function, and may represent the nuclear centers of
two contemporaneous social groups centered on Big Cypress
Creek (Fig. 14). The two sites are about 15 km apart, with
41UR10 upstream of 41MR2.
1989 ADDENDUM: Since this writing, Susan Lisk (1984) has
performed a detailed analysis of the ceramics from 41MR2. The
sherds were cLassified using a traditional sorting into
decorative technique and typological categories in order to
examine the temporal placement of the site. Lisk then sorted
the sherds into vessel batches as far as possibLe, foLLowing
recent analyses by Kleinschmidt (1982) and Driggers (1985) in
order to perform a functional analysis of the collection. She
also provides a useful and detailed description of the exca­
vations.

interior. I would not consider either of these sherds diag·
nostic temporally or spatially within the Cypress basin, as
similar treatments on bottles in particular tend to be ubiq­
uitous. lisk classifies eight sherds as pendant triangle
motif (ibid.: Table 4), but since neither illustrated example
conforms to the motif as used by Turner (1978) or myself as a
diagnostic trait, I would have to question these assignments.
This is all important because, on the basis of these
eight "pendant triangle" Ripley sherds and twelve sherds
which she classifies as HarLeton (ibid.: 111), Susan believes
the component at 41MR2 to be late Whelan phase. I really can
not see it, as I suspect few or none of the "pendant trian­
gle" Ripley sherds really fit the motif description, and I do
not feel the small number of sherds referable to Harleton
(12) versus the large number of PeaSe sherds (425) is very
significant. Rather, I SUspect we are seeing the earliest
stage of the same process we see operant at Chastain (41UR18,
Section 6_3.7.9) of the deveLopment of Harleton from Pease_ I
continue to believe that 41MR2 dates more toward the middle
of the Whelan phase than to its upper end. However, I like
Susan's idea of calling components like Chastain "Late Whelan
phase" rather than "transitional Whelan phase to Titus phase"
(a definite mouthful), as I did in my original study, and I
have adopted it in this updated version.
Lisk analyzed the stratigraphic distribution of the
sherds from mound context to see if there were any discerni­
ble changes in the ceramics from one zone to the next, and
there were not (ibid.: 162-172). This suggests that the use
of the Whelan site occurred over a relatively short period of
time. The results of the vesseL batch analysis are interest­
ing. Jars dominate the collection (which is surprising for a
"ceremonial center"), suggesting that the storage and prepa­
ration of foodstuffs were primary activities at the site_ A
major redistribution function through ritual feasting may be
indicated. The intrasite distribution of the vessel batches
suggest a relative concentration of bowls (presumed serving
vessels) in Mound A, and of jars in the non-mound Structure 2
(ibid.: 180). We might infer therefrom that the storage and
preparation elements of the redistribution function were
performed in Structure 2, and that the feasting occurred in
the Mound A structures.

Lisk (1984: Table 3) identified the foLlowing types in
the sherd collection: Ripley Engraved (195), Pease Brushed­
Incised (425), Maydelle Incised (66), La Rue Neck Banded
(25), Harleton Applique (12), Barkman Engraved (13), Belcher
Washington
Ridged (12), Sinner Linear Punctated (11),
Stamped/Combed (5), Killough Pinched (3), HolLy Fine Engraved
(2) and GLassell Engraved (1). She appropriately emphasizes
the strong similarity in decorative elements of the Ripley
vessels from 41MR2 to the Frankston phase type Poynor En­

Angelina basins, and to the east and northeast along the Red
River.
Surprisingly, Lisk believes the pendant triangle motif
to be present in the colLection of RipLey sherds from 41MR2.
However, she has lumped together both carinated bowl rim and
bottLe body sherds exhibiting a pendant triangle element in
her analysis, and it is not possibLe to sort out how many are
from each vessel form. The two sherds iLLustrated (ibid.:
Fig. 15) as examples of this motif reatly are not. One is a
carinated bowl rim exhibiting an aLternating nested triangle
motif with pendant triangle eLements on the inside of the
diagonals forming the triangles, not on the upper and lower
border lines (see Figure 6-A). The other is a bottle body
with a curvilinear design containing similar elements in its

features were recognized. The area of the site was never
quantified, but it was apparently small. Two discrete concen­
trations of cultural material were noted and designated Areas
A and B (Fig. 26). The vast majority of the material is from
Area Bi only a small quantity of debitage and a few sherds
were recovered from Area A.

latter graves is presented in Table 36. Burial 8 was excavat­
ed in early 1957 by E.M. German of Lone Star and R.R. Nicho­
las of Daingerfield. Burials 1-3 were excavated by the UT
crew in the fall of 1957. German and NichoLas found Burials
4-7 in 1958. That same year, W.A. McCain of Avinger found two
ceramic vessels in a very small, uncontrolled excavation: it
is not clear whether or not the vessels were in a grave.
Davis and Golden recorded these private collections in late
1958 and early 1959. only the specimens from Burials 1-3 are
in Austin; the others have been retained by the collectors.
It is not known who removed the three undocumented graves.
That this had occurred was clear from the presence of three
empty grave pits at the time of the UT excavations.
All of the documented burials were singLe, extended,
supine interments, oriented with the feet of the interred to
the west. The presence of Ripley carinated bowls exhibiting
the pendant triangle motif in every grave indicates that all
are of Titus phase age.
A number of isolated artifacts, not in a clear feature
context (although many must certainly have been in pits),
were found in the cemetery area: 11 ceramic vessels: 1 Ripley
carinated bowl (scroll motif), 1 Taylor carinated bowl, 3
Simms shouldered bowls, 1 Wilder bottle, 1 Wilder olla, 1
zoomorphic effigy bowl, 1 Bullard jar and 2 plain bottles
(this includes the 2 vessels found by McCain); several sherds
of a Ripley carinated bowl; 2 petaloid celts; 4 dart points:
1 Gary, 1 Frio, 1 Yarbrough and 1 Wells; 1 subtriangular
biface; 1 grooved axe and 13 pitted stones. It appears highly
likely that at least nine of the ceramic vessels are from an
unrecognized grave or graves (Davis and Golden 1960: 25-28).

Only a single feature was recognized in the occupation
area, a trash-filled pit measuring 146 x 76 x 46 cm (ibid.:
30-31). No structure was recognized, despite the fact that
well over 75% of the small occupation area was excavated.
However, the soil was extremely saturated with water at the

The cemetery and occupation area appear to have been
contemporaneous, and may represent a single Titus phase
component. It is quite likely that the known popuLation of
the cemetery is an underestimate, given the soil conditions
under which the excavations took place. I have heard vague
reports from several collectors that many additional graves
were found at 41MR12 after the termination of the ferrell's
Bridge Reservoir project, but I have been unable to confirm
these reports.

ciation with the type of deposit typifying such sites on the
Southern Plains, is most intriguing. Site 41MR62 should serve
notice on northeast Texas archeologists to be sensitive to
the potential recurrence of contemporaneous deposits, and
where identified and threatened, such landforms should be
intensively machine tested.

one is struck by the small size and Low artifact density
of the occupation area. This certainly must have been a
short-term and/or low intensity use settlement. I wonder
whether the area might not represent a special function
structure, such as a field house, used seasonally by the
occupants of a larger nearby settlement.
Considering the number interred, the cemetery surely
must relate to a more substantial settLement than that on the
site. The survey recovered only two sherds from the surface
of the site, which would never have been excavated had not
R.R. Nicholas discovered a vessel eroding from the side of a
road which runs through it. If the site had not been excavat­
ed, we would know it as a two sherd Caddoan limited use area.
It seems highly likeLy that such low intensity settlements
are much more common than we have previously realized. Many
of the sites classified as Caddoan "I imited use areas" in
this study are undoubtedly components of this sort. The only
settlements which the criteria of surface visibility used by
the author are likely to detect, in the absence of wattLe­
impressed daub, are the more intensely used general habita­
tion sites.

Jackson 1930b; Turner 1978: 93.
A UT crew under the direction of A.T. Jackson excavated
a small cemetery of four graves in September and OCtober of
1930. The graves were in a tight cluster on the floodplain
floor of a minor watercourse, Prairie Branch (not the same
stream as that shown in Figure 17). The burials appear to
have all been single, extended, supine interments, with the
feet oriented to the west. A summary of the contents of the
graves is presented in TabLe 37. Burial 2 had been partially
looted by a private coLLector, and Jackson was neither able
to purchase nor to photograph the five vessels which had been
removed (Jackson 1930b).
Recovered from the surface and as isolated finds in the
excavations were the following: 14 dart points: 10 Gary,
Wells and 3 blade fragments; 3 miscellaneous bifaces; 3
retouched flakes and 1 abraded slab fragment.

One would assume, given the number and variety of sherds
and the neavy representation of utility ware sherds, that a
settLement was present in the occupation area. Both the
set t Lement and the cemetery appear to be of Titus phase
origin. An earlier Middle Archaic limited use of the occupa­

A cemetery at the site was looted by local individuals
in the spring of 1930, and the recovered artifacts (including
at least 40 ceramic vessels) were sold. Jackson spent four
days at the site with a UT crew in September of 1930, col­
lecting artifacts from the surface and from the looters'
backdirt, and testing for the presence of additionaL graves.
None were found, and it is clear from JaCKSon's photographs
that the site had been severely disturbed (JacKson 1930a).
The number of graves and the character of the specimens
removed by the looters is not known.

Eight complete or nearly complete ceramic vessels were
recovered from backdirt piles or partially looted graves:

This is obviously a mixed bag, and it is difficult to
sort out. The complete vesseL collection indicates that there
were both Early and Late Caddoan (probably Titus phase)
components to the cemetery. Much of the sherd collection
derives from only a few vessels, and it is likely that frag­
ments of shattered grave vessels are mixed in. However, at
Least a portion of the sherd collection seems to be occupa­
tion debris, particularly many of the Williams and thinner
plain Caddoan sherds. Given the presence of both EarLy Cad­
doan Period 2 diagnostics and Williams, it is possible there
was a component at 41MX6 contemporaneous with 41TT11, 23 km
to the northwest (Fig. 12). The dart point collection sug­
gests MiddLe and Late Archaic Limited use areas.

6.3.5.4 41MX8*, Freeman Site
Two uncontrolled surface collections were made by E.M.
Davis in 1959 and 1961. Very limited test excavations were
conducted under the direction of U.A. Davis in October of
1959. All of the work occurred as a part of the FerrelL's
Bridge Reservoir project. R.R. Nicholas of Daingerfield has
also made an uncontrolled surface coLlection of the site.

6.3.5.5 41MX9*, Lone Star SteeL Site
MiLLer et aL. 1951.
Documentation of this site at TARL is very poor. Miller
and Moorman made an uncontrolled surface collection in 1951
for the River Basin Survey during the first Ferrell's Bridge
Reservoir survey. At some tater point in time the site was
apparently tested by private individuals; one burial and a
midden were found. The buriaL contained three ceramic ves­
sels: 1 Ripley carinated bowL (scroLL and circle motif); 1
Wilder olla and 1 Maydelle jar. The surface and testing
collections have been mixed and could not be separated. The
two together contained 82 Caddoan sherds: 9 Ripley carinated
bowl rim (7 pendant triangle, 2 scroll and circle motif), 1
miscellaneous engraved rim, 1 red-slipped rim, 1 Maydelle jar
rim, 2 miscellaneous incised jar rim, 1 punctated jar rim, 1
La Rue jar rim, 1 Bullard jar rim, 2 Karnack jar rim, 1
miscellaneous brushed rim, 1 Bailey bottle body. 3 miscella­
neous engraved body, 3 incised body, 2 Cowhide/Foster/Keno
body (curvilinear trailed lines and shell temper), 1 Killough
body, 2 Harleton body, 1 brushed and punctated body, 8
brushed body, 39 plain body and 2 unclassified; 1 Talco arrow
point; 5 smalL, crude bifaces and 2 unmodified deer ulnae. It
seems quite likely from the composition of the collection
that the private excavators did not keep everything found,
but seLected in favor of diagnostics. The surface scatter at
the site apparently extends over an area of about 6000 sq m.

Testing detected one posthole and a hearth overlying a
posthoLe (presumably the centerpost of a structure) in adja­
cent 5 x 5 foot squares. The posthole and hearth/posthole
were only 1.5 meters apart, so it Seems likely that ·the

GoLdschmidt 1934c, 1935a: 10-15; Turner 1978: 93.
The UT crew under the direction of W. Goldschmidt com­
pletely excavated a smaLL cemetery of ten graves and tested a
nearby midden on Dragoo Creek in 1934 (Fig. 22). The burials
seem to have all been Single, extended, supine interments,
oriented with the feet pointing in a generally westerLy
direction (Goldschmidt 1934c). Two rows of graves can be
discerned, and none of the grave pits cross-cut one another.
The contents of the graves are summarized in Table 39.
Goldschmidt's excavations were sufficiently extensive to
define the limits of the cemetery. It seems likely that the
six vessels purchased by Goldschmidt, which had previously
been exposed by erosion and collected by the Landowner,
derive from Burial 2.

The midden appears to have been roughly circular and 15·
20 meters in diameter. No other descriptive details have been

The dart point, bifaces and pitted stone probably derive
from a Middle Archaic Limited use of the site. The ceramic
collection from mortuary context is dominated by what I wouLd
consider to be Whelan phase diagnostics. However, the limited
presence of Harleton and absence of later arrow point types
would suggest that the graves may date to an early stage of
the transition from Whelan phase to Titus phase. Such dis­
tinctions are more difficult to make in the sherd collection,
but the general similarity of that material to the grave
vessels makes it highly likely that the cemetery and the
small settlement represented by the midden are contemporane­
ous and related.
1989 ADDENDUM: As part of an assessment of the Monticel­

Company, personnel of Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc.
located and shovel tested 41TT4 in 1984 (Bond 1984). The site
was found to actually be 650 meters southeast of its plotted
location at TARL. The backdirt piles and depressions of
Goldschmidt's 1934 excavations were still visible. Extensive
surface examination and shovel testing of the surrounding
area failed to Locate the midden, and Bond (ibid.: 23) con­
cluded that erosion and agricultural disturbance had probably
destroyed most of the habitation area. The site was deemed
lacking in further research potential.

Domination of the mortuary ceramics by Ripley bowls

sugsest that the cemetery at 41TT6 is later than that at
41TT4 (only 3 km to the northwest), probably dating to the
Titus phase. A number of interesting comparisons can be drawn
between these proximate assemblages:
1) the Ripley bowl motifs at 41TT6 were executed by
means of heavy excising, in contrast to the use of fine
curvilinear hachure to fill border elements at 41TT4;
2) there is an overwhelming dominance of the carinated
form among the Ripley bowls at 41TT6, but a multiplicity of
forms at 41TT4:
3> relative to 41TT4, there is a considerable diversifi­
cation in the motifs used on Ripley carinated bowls at 41TT6,
including the introduction of the pendant triangle and inter­
locking horiZontal scroll motifs:
4) the incidence of Wilder bottles increases to a point
of parity with those of the type Ripley at 41TT6:
5) by contrast, there is a marked reduction

Goldschmidt 1934a, 1935: 8-10: Turner 1978: 93.
Goldschmidt supervised the excavation by a UT field crew
of a small cemetery of 10 documented graves in June of 1934.
The plan and topographic position of the cemetery are illus­
trated in Figure 23, and the specimens associated with each
grave are listed in Table 40. Very little skeletal material
was preserved, but the graves appear to follow the Titus
phase pattern of single, extended, supine interments with the
feet of the interred oriented in a generally westerly direc·
tion (Goldschmidt 1934a). No cultural features other than the
graves were recognized in the excavations. An adequately
large area was excavated to define the extent of the ceme­
tery.

The most common utility jar at Caldwell is an everted­
rim jar with three to four horizontal rows of punctations
around the rim and a plain body. These vessels are often
quadrated by four vertical applique fillets running down the
rim and body, and are referable to the type McKinney Plain.
This is quite simiLar to the situation at 41FK2 and 41FK4,
but for the much higher incidence of HarLeton jars at those
sites. Jars of the former sort seem to be most common in the
western part of the basin during the Titus phase.

Many of the sherds in the collection from 41TT6 appear
to be from plow-shattered grave vessels. If one excludes the
Canton, Williams, sandy paste and unclassified Caddoan
sherds, 57.3% of the remainder appear to derive from en­

midt inadvertentLy tapped into a substantial Early Caddoan
Period 2 component. The presence of both Canton and WilLiams
suggests contemporaneity with 41TT11, 6 km to the northeast
(Fig. 12). It is not cLear if Gary dart points continue into
the Early Caddoan period along with WilLiams ceramics, but it
is possible there was a Late Archaic limited use of the site.
Given the presence of a Palmillas dart point, a Middle Archa­
ic limited use is also suggested.

second of those surveys.
There was apparently a cemetery on the floodplain floor
of Swauano Creek, and a scatter of occupationaL debris on a
nearby upland projection. Excavations were limited entirely
to the cemetery. The burials were in pure sand, resulting in
extremely poor skeletal preservation and making it impossible
for the excavators to recognize grave pits. Only three buri­
als in which some skeletal material remained were recognized
as such. Gardner (1930) does note finding 42 "caches" of 2-15
vesseLs, apparently referring to any spot where two or more
vessels were found in close proximity to or in direct contact
with one another. If each sucn cache represented a burial,
there were roughly 45 graves identified_ A total of 236
ceramic vessels was recovered. Given that, for a sample of
195 burials at 11 cemeteries covered by this study (41CP2,
41CP5, 41FK2, 41FK4, 41HS3, 41MR12, 41MX', 41MX2, 41TT4,
41TT6 and 41UR2), the mean number of vessels per grave is
8.89 (SO = 4.16), a more likely estimate of the number of
graves at 41TT7 is 236/8.89 = 27. One would presume there
were roughly 25 to 30 graves, and that many of the "caches"
were clusters of vessels within graves which contained two or
more such clusters.
Specimen inventory numbers were cataloged onto the
specimens from the UT investigations, but no provenience
information was recorded in reference to those designations.
In short, there is no intrasite provenience information for
the collection. A summary classification will therefore be
presented on the same format as for a surface collection: 236
ceramic vessels: 79 RipLey carinated bowLs (22 pendant trian­
gle, 11 scroll, 15 scroll and circle, 26 continuous scroll, 2
alternating nested triangle, 2 interlocking horizontal
scroll, 1 bisected diamond motif), 20 Ripley compound bowls
(2 pendant triangle, 8 scroll, 7 scroll and circle, 3 contin­
uous scroll motif), 7 Ripley peaked compound bowls (4 scroll
and circle, 3 continuous scroll motif), 2 Ripley conoidal
bowls (1 continuous scroll, 1 interlocking horizontaL scroll
motif), 13 RipLey bottles, 6 RipLey everted rim jars, 1
TayLor globular jar, 4 Wilder bottles, 1 Wilder olla,

The composition of the ceramic vessel collection indi­
cates that the cemetery dates to the Titus phase. In compari­
son to the Titus phase components to the immediate southeast,
the absence of BeLcher phase ceramic types and the virtual
absence of the types Taylor Engraved and Karnack Brushed­
Incised is striking. The small settlement (estimated area is
4000 sq m) overlooking the cemetery is surely late Caddoan,
but the problem of its potential contemporaneity with the
cemetery can not be addressed on the basis of the artifacts
recovered from its surface.

A mound on the fLoodpLain of Hart Creek was cross sec­
tioned, a midden on the floodplain to the southwest of the
mound and an occupation area on a terrace remnant to its east
were tested, and an uncontrolled collection of the entire
site was made by a UT crew under the direction of W.R.
Goldschmidt in June and July of 1934. A small cemetery on the
terrace to the east of the mound was excavated by E.M. Ger­
man, R.L. Turner, B.L. Anderson and S. Scarbrough in the
19505. K.M. Brown made additional surface collections and
re-exposed one of Goldschmidt's mound profiles in 1971. The
mound was razed later that year by the landowner.
The dimensions of the mound in 1934 were 73 (N-S) x 49
(E-W) x 4.6 meters. Local residents reported that, prior to
clearing, the mound had been about a meter taller and clearly
rectanguLar in plan, with steep sides and a broad, fLat
platform on top. A probable borrow pit was still visible to
the immediate east of the mound in 1934 (GoLdschmidt 1934b).
Goldschmidt

183

used a team and moldboard to sink a

trench

about 5 meters wide through the center of the mound, along
its short axis, down to the original sub-mound surface. The
resuLting cross section revealed that the mound was entirely
artificial in origin, having been constructed in four major
episodes. Slope wash accumulations indicated that there had
been significant time lapses between the succeeding construc­
tion events. There were probably four sequent structures
represented in the mound: one on each of the three platforms
raised prior to its final capping, and one on the original
ground surface underneath the center of the mound. It is
possibLe that a fifth structure had been built atop the finaL
cap, but any such evidence would have been destroyed by
erosion.
The actual physical remains of two structures were
identified by the excavators. There was a heavy concentration
of wattle-impressed daub and charcoal atop the center of the
third platform, presumably having resulted from the destruc­
tion by fire of 8 structure immediately prior to the raising
of the mound to its final level. On the premound surface, the
southern half of a circular structure was exposed, flanked to
the east and west by north-south running lines of postholes
(recall that Goldschmidt's trench followed an east-west
axis). The latter probably represent portions of a rectangu­
lar perimeter wall which had enclosed the structure. The
exposed perimeter walls were 17 meters apart, and the struc­
ture was 11 meters in diameter. Two midden deposits, roughly
2 x 4 meters in area, and several isolated postholes were
found within the structure. Actually, somewhat less than haLf
of the structure was exposed, and it is not possibLe to
determine if there was a central hearth. No entranceway was
identified, so the entrance was probably on the northwest,
north, or northeast side of the structure. A third midden
deposit, 1.5 meters wide and at least 4 meters long (it was
not completely exposed) ran along the interior side of the
east perimeter wall. A random scatter of postholes and pits
and a concentration of charcoal and ash about 3 meters in
diameter found immediately beyond the western perimeter wall
suggest an outdoor activity area, possibly in part beneath a
canopy of some sort (Goldschmidt 1934b).
All of the material from sub-mound and mound contexts,
from a midden about 300 meters southwest of the mound, and
from the nearby 41TT37 (Fig. 12) was apparently Early Caddoan
Period 2. late Caddoan material was found on the surface of
the mound and in its vicinity. Both Early and late Caddoan
occupational debris were found on the terrace to the east of
the mound (K.M. Brown, p. c.). The following specimens,
including both Goldschmidt's and Brown's collections, have
been recovered from those areas: 2112 Caddoan sherds: 1
pedestal vessel leg fragment, 30 Sanders E. carinated bowL

and 1 wooden plug. In 1957, E.M. Davis photographed a long,
narrow, triangular, well-made biface from 41TTll in the
collection of E.M. German of Lone Star which is quite similar
to a specimen in the TARl collection from 41TT12.
The cemetery excavated by Turner et al. is reported to
have been composed of seven graves containing ceramic vessels
of the types Ripley (including the pendant triangle, scroll,
scroll and circle carinated bowl motifs), Wilder, Cass and La
Rue, and arrow points of the types Talco and Maud (Turner
1978: 93). I do not know its location within the site.
A single radiocarbon date has been assayed from 41TT11
(Valastro et al. 1975: 83). Sample Tx-1306 was collected by
K.M. Brown in 1971 from his fresh exposure of Goldschmidt's
trench in the mound. The sample was collected from several
lenses and zones of mound fill within the second platform. It
was composed of woody charcoal which had apparently been
derived from earlier midden deposits incorporated as mound
fill. The charcoal was therefore produced prior to the con­
struction of the second mound platform. A 1-sigma range date
based on the 5568 year half-life of 540!70 B.P., or A.D.
1340-1480, was assayed.
Uithin the TARL collection, the ratio of plain to
brushed body sherds, 16 to 1, strongly suggests that the
EarLy Caddoan component represents the most intensive use of
the site. Certainly, on the basis of Brown's observations,
most or all of the mound construction occurred during the
Early Caddoan occupation. There is, however, a substantial
late Caddoan component indicated, probably Whelan phase or
late Whelan phase. Given the concentration of this material
noted by Brown around the mound, it is not inconceivable that
a late Caddoan group took advantage of the mound as a conven­
ient, floodproof place to raise a domicile. Again, positive
evidence of such an occurrence wouLd have been destroyed by

At least six components can be recognized at 41TT12:
Late Paleoindian, Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Late Caddoan
(possibly Titus phase) and early Historic Anglo-American
limited use areas: and the primary component, an EarLy Cad­
doan Period 1 mound center and large occupation. The Gary
dart points may indicate a Late Archaic component or may
relate to the Early Caddoan settlement.

*************************************************************
The ceramics indicate that the Early Caddoan component
at 41TT12 is substantially earLier tnan at 41TT'1. The former
is presumably on an equivalent time level with the Davis Site
(41CE19) to the south (Story and Valastro 1977) and the
Harlan Site to the north (SeLL 1972: Brown et al. 1978).

187

Keith appears to be roughly contemporaneous with the sites of
the Spiro phase to the north (Brown et al. 1978). If so, Hale
should date roughly A.D. 1000 to 1250, and Keith A.D. 1250 to
1400. These and other problems of chronology are discussed in
greater detail in Chapter 7. However, one might note at this
juncture the substantially higher incidence of sherds classi­
fiable 8S Williams Plain at 41TT12 relative to 41TT11. A
perusal of the crude classifications presented here indicates
that much could be learned in comparing the utiLity wares at
Keith and Hale by means of an attribute anaLysis.
Finally, it should again be stressed that Jackson's
primary interest in his testing of 41TT12 was a search for
graves. Had the excavations been more carefuLly conducted, it
is extremely likely that more occupational features, particu·
larly structures, would have been identified.
1989 ADDENDUM: Since this writing, 41TT12 has been
placed on the National Register of Historic Places, thanks to
the efforts of Ulrich Kleinschmidt and Susan Lisk. Most of
the site has been donated to Southern Methodist University by
Texas Utilities Mining Company; only the borrow pit, the
extreme northern edge of Mound 2, Mound 6 and the southwest­
ern half of the midden south of Mound 1 remain on private
property (Bond 1982, 1984). Espey, Huston and Associates,
Inc. conducted extensive shovel testing of the site in 1982
in order to determine its boundaries. The soils over the site
were found to be quite shallow, with an A horizon ranging
from 5 to 15 cm in depth underlain by an argillic B. The
results of the shovel testing are not detailed, but Bond
(1982: 10-11) recommended site boundaries encompassing an
area roughly 300 meters in diameter (90,000 sq m), not too
different from my 1981 estimate of 85,000 sq m. That portion
of the site now owned by SHU has been fenced and posted, and
it is to be hoped that this important resource is now safe
from further disturbance.

It is clear from Bell's presentation that the records
from the 1950s work at the site are SKetchy and incomplete.
Bell provides a detailed inventory of burial associations by
grave lot (ibid.: Tables 3 and 5), but does not specify
numbers of vessels and arrow points of specific types there­
in. Vessels of the types Ripley, Taylor, Wilder, Avery, Cass,
Harleton, La Rue, Bullard and McKinney, and a bowl exhibiting
a Simms motif on a Womack-like form are illustrated. The
Ripley carinated bowls include the pendant triangle, scroll,
scroll and circle, interlocking horizontal scroll and contin­
uous scroll motifs. Quantities of each type are not provided
in Bell's report. Nor does Bell provide detailed information
on the arrow points from the 1950s excavations, although
some of the side-notched specimens (c.f. type Reed) from the
burials are illUstrated (ibid.: Fig. 41).
The structure of the cemetery has been reconstructed by
a relation of the notes from the 1950s excavation to the
results of the 1975 blading of the site (ibid: 43-48). The
burials were oriented east-west, with the head to the east,
and the interred were extended and supine. Buri als containing
similar quantities and qualities of grave goods tended to be
clustered within the cemetery, suggesting grouping of the
interred by status.

the presumed knapper's toolkit in Burial 14 than that pub.

FIGURE 25. 41TT28. GOPHER RUN SITE. Illustrated is a plan of the SMU excavations at the site. The primary components were apparently Early
Caddoan Period 1 and Titus phase small settlements. There were also substantial Archaic components. Adapted from McCormick 1974.

McCormick (1974: 55-78) reports that the following
specimens were recovered by the testing: 4952 Caddoan sherds:
263 engraved, 284 incised, 179 punctated, 14 appliqued, 3
neck-banded, 172 brushed, 3161 plain, 68 "other" and 808
unclassified: 1 mud dauber nest: 3 ceramic pipe stem frag­
ments (the only illustrated specimen is from a Red River
pipe); 1 ceramic pipe bowl fragment: apparently large but
unquantified amounts of wattLe-impressed daub and other
burned clay fragments; 41 arrow points: 12 Alba, 1 Harrell, 2
"LiverlllOre" (in northeast Texas?), 1 Bonham, 4 ScalLorn, 7
Perdiz, 3 Cliffton, 5 Cuney, 2 Starr, 3 Maud and 1 TaLco; 53
dart points: 39 Gary, 1 Kent, 1 PedernaLes, 2 Carrollton, 2
Morrill and 8 Wells; 1 chipped drill: 32 misceLLaneous bi­
faces: 18 biface preforms; 37 retouched fLakes and chips; 82
cores and core fragments; 9992 unretouched fLakes and chips;
3 battered cobbles; 1 abraded cobbLe; 2 pitted stones; 1
grooved abrader: 1 Clear Fork gouge: a large but unspecified
quantity of burned rock fragments and 5 unidentified bone
fragments. McCormick (ibid.) also classified typologically 45
of the sherds listed above: 4 Ripley, 2 Poynor, 3 Avery, 2
Bowie, 1 Maddox E., 3 Holly, 1 Spiro, 4 Maydelle, 6 Canton, 1
Davis, 1 Karnack, 1 Pease, 6 Bullard,S La Rue and 5 Harle­

find many of these identifications hard to believe,
and the only illustration of sherds from 41TT28 provided by
McCormick (1974: Fig. 35) is not comforting: 2 Harleton body
sherds are illustrated sideways and a MaydeLle rim is upside
down; the upside down rim is clearly from an everted rim jar,
but is cLassified as Canton: and a Holly sherd is cLassified
as Spiro. ALong these same lines, one might note that in his
breakdown of the sherds by decorative technique McCormick
(ibid.: 72) states that three were neck-banded, but in the
typoLogical breakdown (ibid.: 73), five are classified as La
Rue. A Bonham arrow point is ilLustrated and correctly iden­
tified (ibid.: Fig. 25e), but does not appear in the distri
bution table of projectile points which McCormick presents
(ibid.: 57).

distributed around 41TT12 ca. A.D. 1000-1200. If so, the
apparent mate of 41TT28 would have been 41TT151 (Fig. 12). In
this light, it is interesting to note the implication in the
two presumed centerposts underneath the hearth described
above of two sequent structures having been built on precise­
ly the same spot. A formalized set of kinship relations may
be suggested on both an intrasite and intersite leveL in the
Early Caddoan sites around 41T112.
The sherds illustrated by McCormick (1974: Fig. 35)
suggest that the Late Caddoan component was primarily Titus
phase, and probably related to the components at 41FK2 and
41FK4. However, this is onLy an impression on a subjective
level. The dart point collection clearly indicates Early and
Middle Archaic components, probably limited use areas. The
presence of Williams PLain is consistent with the situation
at 41TT12; if anything, there was probably more of it (relat­
ing to the Early Caddoan component) than McCormick realized.
The Gary dart points are more troubLesome, and it is simply
not clear whether their manufacture continued into the Early
Caddoan period with that of Williams Plain or not. It is
possible (and by no means unLikely) that there was a substan­
tial Late Archaic component at 41TT28.

the settlement system implications of 41TT36 are the chrono­
logical implications of a comparison of its mortuary ceramics
with those at 41FK32, previously described in Section
6.3.2.6. The two share very similar incised and plain ware,
differing only in the character of their engraved wares: a
crude Holly-like bowl at 41TT36, and two proto-Ripley bottles
at 41FK32. The samples are exceedingly small, but the two
sites may trace the earliest stage of an indigenous develop­
ment of local Late Caddoan cultures, culminating in the Titus
phase, from a terminal Early Caddoan Period 2 base.

Benson's Crossing was a very Large site, covering some
130,000 sq m of a terrace remnant on the north side of Big
Cypress Creek. The site extended almost a kilometer aLong the
streamward edge of the terrace, averaging 120-150 meters in
width. The density of occupational debris was greatest along
the terrace edge and tended to drop off rather abruptLy
beyond a distance of 25 meters from that edge.
Most of the excavation, both controlled and uncon­
trolled, was concentrated on the western end of the site. One
SHU test pit encountered a concentration of charcoal, burned
cLay and burned rock fragments at the base of the pLowzone,
which was interpreted by SulLivan (1975: 74) as a hearth. The
SMU investigations recovered 107 Caddoan sherds: 2 red­
slipped, 1 incised,S brushed and 99 plain; 1 arrow point
preform; 4 dart points: 2 Gary, 1 Edgewood and 1 blade frag­
ment; 1 miscellaneous biface; 5 retouched flakes; 3 cores;
343 unretouched flakes and chips; 1 abraded slab; unstated
quantities of burned rock and wattle-impressed daub and 5
bone fragments (ibid.: 39, 74-78). The exact Location of the
SMU test pits is not clear, but they were apparentLy quite
close to the midden later excavated by UT.
Private collectors recovered an enormous number of
artifacts from the western end of the site. The author and
students in the field school were able to record the collec­
tions of seven individuals which contained the following
specimens: 457 Caddoan sherds: 8 red-slipped rim, 11 engraved
rim, 8 incised rim, 6 incised and punctated rim, 2 punctated
rim, 4 fingernail-impressed rim, 6 neck-banded rim, 1 brushed
and punctated rim, 2 brushed rim, 39 plain rim, 12 red­

Perkin pikes; 9 non-local chert retouched flakes; 3 Clear
Fork gouges; 1 tabular celt; 1 grooved axe; 2 polished peb­
bles; 1 battered cobbLe: 2 abraded cobbles; 3 abraded sLabs
and 6 pitted stones. The sherds included 1 crude Ripley-like
rim fragment, 1 Sanders E.-like rim fragment, 1 Avery-like
rim fragment, 1 possible Avery bottle body fragment and 2
possible Pease jar body fragments. Much of this material,
particularly the sherds, Wattle-impressed daub and arrow
points, appears to have been found quite close to the UT
midden excavations. Dart points and lithic debris were found
at depths of up to 1.5 meters below the surface of the ter­
race.
In addition to the Caddoan midden, the UT field school
identified a cluster of burned rocks, roughly 3 meters in
diameter, which is believed to represent a discard pile, and
four isolated postholes. Extensive machine testing was con­
ducted in the immediate vicinity of the midden in an attempt

to locate the presumed associated domiciliary structure, but
none was found. However, the area between the midden and the
terrace edge (a distance of about 40 meters) had been virtu­
alLy obliterated by private collector digging, and it is
known that wattle-impressed daub was found in that area. It
therefore seems quite probable that a structure was originaL­
ly present, but that its remains had been destroyed prior to
the UT excavations_
Analysis of the lithic specimens and associated materi­
als recovered by the field school had not been c~leted as
of this writing, but W.G. Driggers graciously provided a
classification of the ceramic sherds, which total 22,736 in
number. Most of the material is from the midden. Driggers
divided the coLlection into specimens larger and smaller than
1/2 inch, and subdivided the former group into rim, body, and
base fragments. Of the 1410 rims, there are 211 red-slipped,
320 engraved, 246 incised, 129 incised and punctated, 190
punctated, 76 neck-banded, 14 brushed and punctated, 17
brushed and appliqued, 37 brushed and 170 plain. There are
8720 body sherds: 533 red-sl ipped, 3 engraved, 584 incised,
277 punctated, 34 incised and punctated, 32 appl iqued, 17
punctated and brushed, 1151 brushed and 6089 plain. The base
sherds include 226 plain and 2 incised. Of the 12,378 sherds
smaller than 1/2 inch, 1116 are red-slipped, 97 engraved, 452
incised, 197 punctated, 10 incised and punctated, 6 neck­
banded, 6 appliqued, 511 brushed and 9983 were plain.
The collection is overwhelmingly dominated by plain
sherds (72.4%), which are followed in frequency by red­
slipped (8.1%) and brushed (7.6%). It is also interesting
that the frequency of incising and punctation (here using the
term to include fingernail impression) among the body sherds
at 41TT110 (10.3% combined) is not all that different from
the percentage in the colLection from the nearby Early Cad­
doan component at 41TT12 (13.6%). However, 12.9% of the plain
body sherds at 41TT12 fall within the Williams Plain range of
paste and thickness, and there are fewer than ten such sherds
in the 41TT110 collection, none of those from the midden.
Very few of the sherds in the field school collection
from 41TT110 are typologically classifiable. Within the
engraved sherds there are some very crudely executed carinat­
ed bowl rims and compound bowl shoulders which exhibit the
Ripley scroll and scroll and circle motifs. The border ele­
ments 00 these sherds are frequently filled with the curvi­
linear hachures common to Whelan phase contexts. A few com­
pound bowl shoulders and conoidal bowl rims are likewise
quite carelessly engraved with the Avery alternating concen­
tric semicircle motif in which one ring of each element is
spurred. Many of the incised and punctated jar rims could be
classified as MaydeLLe, and some of the brushed jar rims as
Bullard. A few of the brushed and punctated sherds could be
classified as Pease.
One very interesting sherd in the field school collec­
tion is a red-sl ipped body fragment, possibly from a conQidal
bowl, on which has been engraved a crudely executed and
highly stylized feathered serpent motif. one might recall
that Woodall (1967) reports a "rattlesnake motif" on a bottle
in a Middle Caddoan grave at 41CP10, reviewed in Section
6.3.1.6.

*****************************************************************************************************************************
The final major body of information to be covered in
this summary of Benson's Crossing is that pertaining to the
two graves (designated Burials 1 and 2) found by collectors
subsequent to the field school excavations. The burials were
found after the lake had risen to the edge of the terrace,
saturating the soil of the site. The collectors found the
offerings in each grave by probing in the mud with their
hands. Therefore, the information which these individuals
could provide regarding the layout and orientation of the
graves must be accepted with caution. It was their impres­
sion, however, that both were single, extended, supine inter­
ments with the grave goods distributed in an arc about the
head. Burial 1 was oriented with the feet to the west, and
Burial 2 with the feet to the north. The burials were appar­
ently less than a meter apart and were within 10 meters of
the midden excavated by the field school. Ceramic vessels
were the only grave goods recognized by the collectors, but
given the manner of excavation, smaller artifacts could
easily have been missed. The vessels are described in Table
45. Temper was assessed only for vessels having a preexisting
break in the surface.

the engraved ware of Avery

Despite the proximity of the graves to the midden, it
seems unlikely that the features are related. The graves are
probably somewhat later than the midden. The cultural origin
of the graves is probLematic, as the ceramics do not relate
to the local tradition. There is a strong similarity to some
of the Avery and Nash vessels at the Sam Kaufman site, rough­
ly 90 km to the north of 41TT110 in Red River County (c.f.
Skinner et al. 1969: Figs 12d, 13h, 14b, 20c and 22c, d). The
Avery bottles are similar to specimens illustrated by Suhm
and Jelks (1962: Plate 2g, k) from Bowie County, Texas and
McCurtain County, Oklahoma. ~ilson (1962: Plate 55: 22)
illustrates a body sherd from the A.Y. Davis site in McCur­
tain county which exhibits an hourglass-shaped element at the
center of a concentric circle motif, quite similar to the
central motifs of vessels 1 and 9 in Burial 1 and vessel 5 in
Burial 2. An affiliation with the McCurtain phase groups to
the north on the Red River is certainly suggested, and the
dissimilarity of the material to that of other sites in the
surrounding area may indicate an incursion into the area by a

The compound bowls have very large strap handles on their
rims, and there is never a clear break between the shoulder
and body; the decoration continues uninterrupted across both.

over the years, usually while plowing. We recorded his ceram­
ic vessels, about a fourth of his sherd collection and about
a third of his lithic collection. Scott did not collect
lithic debitage or plain sherds, and our recording concen­
trated on chronologically diagnostic rim sherds and intact
projectiLe points. The following material was thus recorded:
5 ceramic vessels: 1 Avery conoidal bowl, 1 Ripley bottle, 1
La Rue jar, 1 untyped engraved carinated bowl and 1 untyped
incised utility jar; 37 Caddoan sherds: 16 Ripley carinated

abraded cobbles; 2 abraded slabs; 1 grooved abrader and 4
pitted stones. The ceramic vessels were found eroding from a
terrace scarp on the eastern edge of the site and apparently
derive from two burials.
Components dating to the Late Paleoindian, Early, Hiddle
and Late Archaic and Late Caddoan periods are indicated by
this collection. Use of the site appears to have become
progressively more intense during the preceramic periods,
culminating in a quite heavy use during the Late Archaic. A
Titus phase component is indicated by the ceramic vessels and
sherds.

The three sites 41TT110, 41TT114 and 41TT119 occupied
the same terrace on the north side of Big cypress Creek in
the lake Bob Sandlin area. Wherever professionals or collec­
tors excavated in this terrace, cultural material of consid­
erable quantity and chronological diversity was found, de­
spite a dearth of artifacts on its surface. It seems likely
that a high density of habitation debris occurred all along
the streamward edge of this landform. One must assume that
similar concentrations of archeological materials occur in
valley margin terraces throughout the Cypress basin. These
sites will be buried, and can be detected only through test­
ing. Such landforms should be intensively tested as a matter
of course during any archeological salvage project in north­
east Texas.

cally cLassifiable, but some of the jar rims may be referable
to the types Canton Incised, Dunkin Incised and Kiam Incised,
and others to MaydelLe Incised.

A single aboriginaL feature was identified by the test­
ing, a 54 x 41 em concentration of 22 burned ferruginous
sandstone fragments (incLuded in the count above) and char­
coal, interpreted as a probable hearth. Testing determined
the limits of the site to be 380 x 85 meters, or 32,300 sq m.
Distinct concentrations of Caddoan sherds and wattle-im­
pressed daub were noted in the northeastern and southern
parts of the site (ibid.: 58). It was noted that most of the
lithic material was not recovered from these parts of the
site, and these specimens are presumed to derive primarily
from Archaic use of the site.
If the Caddoan sherds derive from a single component,
the composition of the collection wouLd seem to relate to the
Middle Caddoan period. Although the sample from 41TT310 is
quite small, the incidence of brushing and red-slipping
compares favorabLy with the data from ~1TT110, and it is
possible that the two sites are contemporaneous. A small
settlement is suggested by the site area and presence of
daub. Limited use during the Middle and late Archaic is
suggested by the dart points, and the Historic Anglo-American
material is interpreted by Prikryl (ibid.) as indicative of a
mid to late 19th century domicile.

The graves were all single interments, with the interred
placed in extended, supine poSition and oriented with the
feet to the west. The offerings in each grave were placed at
the feet of the interred, in contrast to the usual Titus

grave. A summary of the grave goods in presented in Table 47.

Jackson supervised the excavation by a UT crew of a
cemetery of 18 graves in June of 1931. The buriaLs were
tightly grouped in an area of about 750 sq m. Very little
skeletal material was present, but the graves appeared to
follow the Titus phase pattern of single, extended, supine
interments with the feet oriented in a westerly direction. As
at 41CP17 and 41HS3, a layer of grayish-white sand covered
the floors of many of the graves (Jackson 1931d). A grave­
specific cLassification of the artifacts and associated
materiaLs is presented in Table 48. The presence of Ripley
carinated bowls exhibiting the pendant triangle motif and/or
Talco arrow points in all but Burial 18 strongly indicate
that use of the cemetery occurred entirely during the Titus
phase.

on two occasions by small UT crews under the direction of
E.M. Davis in October of 1957 and by E.B. Jelks in November
of that year. A total area of about 15 sq m was excavated in
a site encompassing an estimated 15,000 sq m.

JeLks and Tunnell 1959: Tamers et al. 1964; Pearson et

E.M. Davis and B. Golden recorded the site for UT in
October of 1957. Four mounds were noted and designated A-D
(Fig. 27). A National Park Service crew excavated Mound A in
December of 1957. In September of 1958 and February of 1959,
a larger UT crew excavated the three remaining mounds and
tested the surrounding floodpLain floor for evidence of an
immediateLy adjacent occupation. None was found. A detai Led
report of these investigations has been published by JeLks
and Tunnell (1959).

Seven components can be identified at 41UR10: Late
Paleoindian, Early, MiddLe and Late Archaic, Early Caddoan
and Titus phase limited use areas, and a Whelan phase mound
center. As is discussed in Chapter 7, it ;s quite possible
that the Whelan phase components at 41UR9, 41UR10, 41UR13,
41UR14 and 41UR15 (Fig. 27) form a synchronous settlement
system, possibly contemporaneous with and on an equal hierar­
chical level to one formed by 41MR1, 41MR2, 41MR27, 41MR32
and 41MR33 (Fig. 21) about 15 km downstream (Fig. 14).

The dimensions of the mounds were as follows: Mound A:
10.7 (E-W) x 8.5 (N-S) x .6 meters; Mound B: 16.8 x 16.8 X .9
meters; Mound C: 18.9 (E-W) x 15.9 (N-S) x .9 meters; Mound
0: 18.3 x 18.3 x .8 meters. Mound A covered the grave of a
single juvenile male in a sub-mound pit, associated with 1

The site was recorded by a private individual, S. White­
side of Tyler, in December of 1957. In 1958, a UT crew under
the direction of E.M. Davis and W.A. Davis excavated approxi­
mately 60% of the mound at the site and performed extensive
testing around the mound in an unsuccessful search for an
adjacent occupation area.
The mound was roughly circular, 16.8 meters in diameter
and .8 meters in height. Its sequence of construction has
been interpreted as follows by Davis and Gipson (1960: 17­
19): 1) a pit 5.5 meters in diameter and 9-12 cm deep was
excavatedi 2) a low embankment was built around the pit with
the baekdirt; a structure (designated House A) was built
within the pit, and its floor was lined with puddled claYi 3)
the structure was presumably used for a time, and was then
destroyed; 4) the debris was removed, a second, larger struc­
ture (House B) was erected and a second prepared clay floor
was laid down; 5) the second structure, presumably after a
period of use, was destroyed by fire and 6) sand was very
soon afterward piled over the burned remains to form the
mound.

House 2: 4.3 meters in diameter; circular in plan; centered
over House 1: entrance to west (not extended): central hearth
underlain by posthole; 30 em deep midden accumulation on

at The University of Texas at Austin. The 1-sigma range based
on the 5568 year half-life is 480!110 B.P., or A.D. 1360-1580
(Tamers et ale 1964).
At least five components can be identified on the basis
of the preceding information: Late Paleoindian, EarLy, Middle
and Late Archaic limited use areas and a Whelan phase or late
Whelan phase mound. The exact chronologicaL status of the
last component rust be left somewhat equivocal. The mound is
certainly quite close to the classic Whelan phase in time.
However, the proximity of 41UR11 to 41UR18, where Pease and
apparently early forms of Harleton occur in the same grave,
and the occurrence of Harleton sherds in the collections from
the two sites, are suggestive. It is possible that 41UR11 and
41UR18 are slightly later than the classic Whelan phase
components, occurring at a point in time where the cluster of
ceramic concepts we call Harleton had begun to develop out of
the cluster we term Pease. Although the mortuary associations
at 41UR18 are reliable, it is possible that the Harleton
sherds at 41UR11 are later than the mound and derive from a
Titus phase limited use of the site. Along these lines, one
might note the Ripley pendant triangle sherds at 41UR10 and
the sherds of the possible Hudson vessel at 41UR11.

W.A. Davis made an uncontrolled surface collection of
the site in June of 1958 and supervised its partial excava­

the Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir project. A report of the
results has been published by E.M. Davis and W.A. Davis

No features were recognized. The site was on an upland
projection on a slope sufficiently high above the floodplain
of Big Cypress Creek to be in a net erosional environment
(Fig. 27). Tnerefore, the debris of tne multiple preceramic
occupations indicated by tne dart point collection was quite
mixed, with no stratigraphic separation of components. The

The latter assignment must be considered problematic at best,
as we can not be sure how much (if any) of the late Caddoan
ceramic material in the collection actually derives from the
site. The mound appears to have been roughly contemporaneous

noted collecting a deer ulna fLaking tool from the surface of
the midden, but this specimen has been lost or stolen. There
is no intrasite provenience documentation on the collection,
but one would assume that the Early and Late Caddoan material
derive from the mound and midden, respectively.

The mound was circular in plan, roughly 23 meters in
diameter and one meter high. Jackson dug a 1.8 x 1.2 meter
pit somewhere in the mound, presumabLy at its center, and
encountered three ca. 3 em thick lenses of charcoal at depths
of 30, 76 and 102 em below the surface of the mound. All
three lenses extended beyond the margins of the test pit. A
few sherds were recovered from "beneath the charcoal" (Jack­
son 1930e). The area of the midden waS not recorded.

However, I have a very hard time believing that all of
the Titus phase materials in the TARL collection for 41W016
actually derive from the site. The Ripley pendant triangle

sherds are totaLly out of context this far west in the Cy­

7.2.2 Component Function by Chronological Period

OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

A number of interesting trends can be noted in comparing
the relative frequencies of component functional types from
one period to the next in TabLe 52 and Figure 28. During the
Preceramic periods, there is a steady increase in the total
number of components from 28 in Paleoindian times to 102
during the Late Archaic. These figures exclude components of
unknown function. Table 53 and Figure 29 include all chrono­
logically classifiable components, and the total number of
components dating to each period can be found in the last
column of Table 53. The trend is the same in either set of
data; a steady growth in the total number of components from
one Preceramic period to the next. Further, there is a moder­
ate increase in the proportionate representation of heavy use
areas relative to limited use areas during the Preceramic,
suggesting an increase in the intensity of use of individual
sites. As is discussed in greater detail in Section 7.6, the
data indicate steady population growth during the Preceramic,
and perhaps some related changes in subsistence practices,
the size of social group territories and the character of
intergroup exchange networks.

7.1

Introduction

The primary objectives of this study are to provide an
inventory of recorded archeoLogicaL sites in the Cypress
basin and, by noting some (and by no means aLL) of the pat­
terns visibLe in the existing data base, to propose fruitfuL
directions for future archeoLogicaL research in the vicinity
of the study area. Having compLeted the inventory of recorded
sites, a number of interpretive probLems are now addressed in
a somewhat cursory fashion. The intent is not exhaustiveLy
to expLore any particuLar probLem, as each wouLd require a
Lengthy analysis in itseLf, and most couLd probabLy not be
resoLved on the basis of the current data. It is mereLy hoped
that the discussion which foLLows wiLL serve to provide some
useful problem orientations to future students of the area.
It has been repeatedLy noted in the preceding chapters
that the history and character of archeoLogicaL data coLLec­
tion in the Cypress basin have been haphazard and variabLe to
an extreme. Various biases have been identified as affecting
the validity of this or that portion of the site sampLe, or
the sampLe as a whoLe. I am therefore of the opinion that any
anaLysis or interpretation of the data must remain on a
tentative LeveL. Section 7.2 briefLy summarizes the distribu­
tion and functionaL character of the recorded sites in the
basin. Sections 7.3 through 7.5 address certain probLems of
chronoLogy and sociaL group identification, sociaL organiza­
tion and demography, respectively. FinaLLy, in Section 7.6, a
number of recommendations pertaining to cuLturaL resource
management are presented.

The relative frequency of Limited use areas also has
some interesting impLications during the Ceramic periods. The
simiLarity in proportionate representation of such components
between the Late Archaic (80.4%) and EarLy Ceramic (80.0%)
periods wouLd lead one to concLude that any changes in the
settlement or subsistence patterns which may have accompanied
the introduction of pottery were at least initiaLLy minimal.
By contrast, the frequency of occurrence of limited use areas
during aLL of the Caddoan periods is strikingLy Low, and
steadily decLines from 27.5% during the Early Caddoan period
to 15.4% by Belcher/Titus phase times. It is possible (aL­
though certainly debatable) that this Preceramic/Ceramic
contrast in Limited use area frequency might in part be due

of collections performed for the present study can serve to
demonstrate the complexity of the problem, and to propose
some preliminary interpretive constructs.

7.2.5 Spring-Adjacent Components

The discussion which follows focuses on the archeologi­
cal sites in the central and northwestern parts of the Cy­
press basin, where I have had the opportunity to personally
analyze many of the artifact collections. All of the informa­
tion from Ceramic components in the eastern part of the basin
is derived from published sources, and the established chro­
nology for that area has therefore been followed without any
attempt at enhancement.

If one considers the relative frequency of spring-adja­
cent components dating to different chronological periods,
there are marked differences from one period to the next
(TabLe 57, Fig. 33). However, such a comparison does not take
into account the fact that the total number of identifiable
components per period also varies considerably. For example,
if there were little chronological variation in the frequency
of spring-adjacent components, one would expect a period with
twice as many components overall as another period to have
twice as many spring-adjacent components. Table 58 addresses
this problem by examining the difference between the relative
frequency of spring-adjacent components of each period and
the overall frequency of components of that period. By sub­
tracting the two figures for each period, the bias of overall
component frequency is el iminated.
The relative occurrence of components of each period
adjacent to springs is not all that different from the fre­
quency of components per period, indicating that there are
few strong associations of the components of a particular
period with springs. The primary exception to this observa­
tion is the lack of spring-adjacent components during
Whelan/Bossier phase times. This reflects the occurrence of
sites of the two phases along the mainstems of Big Cypress
Creek and the Red River.
7.3 Ceramic Chronological and Spatial Trends
7.3.1

Introduction

Discussion of problems of culture sequence and chronolo­
gy in this section concentrates on the Ceramic end of the
scale, and the Caddoan periods in particular. The data of the
present study offer no opportunities for the refinement of
the Local Preceramic chronology. Preceramic temporal units
and their diagnostics were defined at the inception of the
study on the basis of previous work in surrounding areas
(Section 4.3.6, Table 8). Existing chronological models have
been followed without alteration in the identification and
classification of Preceramic components, without the benefit
of stratigraphic confirmation of the presumed diagnostic
sequence at any site within the Cypress basin.
By contrast, the present Cypress basin data base pro­
vides a wealth of potential insight into the Ceramic culture
sequence. Again, stratified sites are lacking, but contempo­
raneous artifact assemblages can be identified in burials,
middens and single-component sites, and then seriated. The
process is not as simple as it might seem, however, as there
is a complex interplay of synchronic social group and chrono­
logical factors reflected in the Ceramic (and particularly
the Late Caddoan) material culture of the study area. To
unravel this complexity, detailed attribute analyses of
existing artifact collections and archeoLogical investigation

The basic organizational terminoLogy employed by the
chronologicaL classification of this study departs from
previous usages. Other students of the area have generally
followed the modified Midwestern Taxonomic System classifica­
tion defined by Krieger (1946) and SUhm et al. (1954), which
classified the culture sequence hierarchically into stages,
aspects and foci, in order of scale. Each successive level of
the system encompassed both a larger geographic area and a
longer time span. The system was a useful innovation, in that
it concentrated on both the identification of local cultures
and their genetic relationships. However, Krieger's terminol­
ogy has its drawbacks. The spatial and chronological parame­
ters of the cultures described are merged at each level of
the system. Early and Late Caddoan geographic specializations
are classified by the same term, focus. It is highly likely
that two entirely different sociocultural phenomena are so
grouped, and it is perhaps only in Late Caddoan times that
one may plausibly speak of "local cultures." The regional
, variations which Krieger was able to identify among the Early
Caddoan components, such as the Alto and Sanders foci, in
many cases cover much larger geographic areas than their Late
Caddoan counterparts, and probably are the result of entirely
different sociopolitical mechanisms.
The present study largely side-steps this difficulty by
the use of two chronological terms. Prior to the Late Caddoan
end of the time scale, the chronological classification is
divided into "periods" (e.g. Middle Archaic period) which are
simply temporal divisions with no spatial implications of
internal relevance to the Cypress basin. Components of the
Late Caddoan period are further subdivided into phases. The
term "phase" is here used speCifically to denote chronologi­
cal change within the Late Caddoan local cultures labeled
foci by Krieger. Thus, Krieger'S Titus focus is temporally
divided into the Whelan and Titus phases.
The primary element lacking in my approach is a substi­
tute for the spatial element of the term focus. Story has
formulated a model of Late Caddoan sociopolitical organiza­
tion for the local cultures identified by Krieger as the
Frankston and Allen foci (Story and Creel 1981: 30-34, Fig.
8) which is directly applicable. The two foci are interpreted
as the prehistoric and historic archeological manifestations
of a single major Caddoan social group, the Hasins; Confed­
eracy, as defined by Swanton (1942). This "confederacY" is
seen as a weakly hierarchical sociopolitical structure with
two levels of integration. Story's terminological equivalent
of Swanton's confederacy, the "affiliated group", represents

have detected a concentration of sites of the period relative
to the rest of the basin. It is possible that we see therein
the remains of a discrete population. I find it interesting
that this set of Middle Caddoan sites clusters around the
locations of 41TT12, an Early Caddoan Period 1 mound center,
and 41TT11, a mound center relating to Early Caddoan Period
2. This may all be survey bias deriving from the concentra­
tion of survey activity in the vicinity (Fig. 5). Yet one

is noteworthy that the Whelan phase components seem
most densely clustered in the middle reaches of Big
Creek, and occur much less frequently in the far
part of the basin. To my knowledge, no identifiable
~helan phase components have been identified outside the
Cypress basin. As will become clear in the Section 7.3.4
discussion of Titus phase subclusters, the most westerly
components on that time level are difficult to relate geneti­
cally to the Whelan phase. Interestingly enough, interviews
with private collectors and avocational archeologists (North­
ern and Skiles 1981) indicate that Whelan phase sites occur
along the middle reaches of Little Cypress Creek (Fig. 1),
but none of these sites have been recorded to date.

7.3.3.4 Whelan Phase
The Whelan phase components (Fig. 14) represent the
earliest clear crystallization of the Late Caddoan local
culture defined herein as the Cypress cluster (Sec. 7.3.1).
Perhaps the best exaq>les are at the Whelan (41MR2), Reed
(41UR1) and Harroun (41UR10) sites. The engraved vessels of
these components are almost exclusiveLy classifiable as
Ripley Engraved, with Taylor Engraved and Wi lder Engraved
occurring IILICh less frequently. The most common associated
vessel forms are carinated bowls with everted or vertical
rims and rounded or rolled-out lips; cClq)Ound bowls wi th tall
rims (often peaked) and well-defined shoulders; and bottles
with tall, cylindrical necks and biconical bodies. A single
Poynor Engraved globular bowl, almost certainly of non-local
orIgIn, occurred in burial association at the Reed site
(41UR1). The Ripley bowls exhibit the scroll, scroll and
circle, continuous scroll, alternating nested triangle,
horizontal diamond and bisected diamond motifs. The border
elements of the Ripley motifs are commonly filled with care­
lessly-executed curvilinear hatchures.

7.3.3.5 Titus Phase
Components of the Titus phase are perhaps the best
documented of the Cypress basin chronological units due to
the frequent occurrence of cemeteries during the phase (Fig.
15). The following discussion represents a gross generaliza­
tion of the spatial differentiation which can be seen in the
Titus phase ceramics, and is intended merely to provide the
reader with a basic awareness of the contrasts between the
material culture of the Titus phase components and that of
the precedent ~helan phase. Much of the information presented
below applies only to the eastern Titus components, which are
spatially coincident with those of the ~helan phase.
As during the Whelan phase, Ripley Engraved tends to
dominate the engraved ware of the Titus phase. However, there
is a considerable diversification in the engraved ware; the
types TayLor Engraved and Wilder Engraved are much more
frequent than during the Whelan phase, and the types Bailey
Engraved and Johns Engraved appear for the first time. The
Ripley pendant triangle motif appears to be an innovation
limited to the Titus phase. The designs on the engraved wares
tend to be more carefully executed than those of the ~helan
phase, and the careless curvilinear hachures within border
elements of the earlier phase are largely replaced by broad,
deeply excised areas. Vessel forms are much the same as
during the Whelan phase.

The utility wares are distinctly different from those of
the Early Caddoan periods. Although the vessel forms are much

same frequencies. On the Ripley bowls, the pendant triangle motif is more common than all others combined, but the scroll,
scroll and circle and continuous scroll motifs also occur at significant frequencies. Bailey Engraved, Johns Engraved and
Wilder Engraved are all relatively minor types within the engraved ware, but Bailey is the more common of the three. Brushed
ware dominates the utility vessels, with Bullard Brushed and Karnack Brushed-Incised the most common types. Harleton Ap­

*************************************••*•••••***••*******.******************•••***••*.****.******.***********•••*************
From the pubLished descriptions (Turner 1978, Bell
1981), three of the Titus phase cemeteries appear to contain
discrete clusters of burials containing assemblages at­
tributable to the Tankersley Creek and Swauano Creek subclus­
ters. The sites are 41CP5, Tuck Carpenter; 41CP12, the Johns
site; and 41TT13, the Alex Justiss site (Fig. 35). If such is
the case, we may be seeing the sharing of defined cemetery
areas by neighboring communities of two constituent groups.
To summarize, what is being suggested here is that a
third Caddoan confederacy in addition to those of the Hasinai
and Kadohadacho existed in late prehistoric, protohistoric
and early historic times, centered geographically on the
upper Cypress Creek, White Oak Bayou and Lake Fork Creek
basins. Following Story's model, the archeological manifesta·
tion of this postulated sociopolitical entity has been termed
the Cypress cluster. Two sequential teq>oral units have been
defined within the Cypress cluster, the Whelan and Titus
phases. There is evidence that the geographic distribution of
Cypress cluster components extended beyond the Cypress basin
only during the Titus phase, but this has not been conclu­
sively established. If such is the case, a substantial west­
ward expansion of the affiLiated group represented by the
Cypress cluster is indicated from Whelan phase to Titus phase
times. Components of the Titus phase are sufficiently well­
documented to permit the identification of four distinct
spatial variations In the their associated assemblages, even

on the basis of the relatively crude modified typological
classification employed by the present study. These spatial
subgroups, herein termed subclusters', are tentatively identi­
fied with the constituent groups of Story·s model.
I have previously suggested that the failure of ethnog­
raphers to recognize the Cypress cluster might reflect its
position off the beaten path, in the uplands far to the west
of the Red River and off the most direct route between the
Kadohadacho in the Great Bend region and the Hssinei in the
upper Neches/Angelina basins (Thurmond 1981, 1985). Both of
the latter groups were initially recorded by the De Soto
expedition in 1542 (Swanton 1939, 1942), and were fairly well
documented during the 1700s due to Spanish miss ionizing of
the Hasinai and French trading with the Kadohadacho. However,
I have never liked negative evidence arguments, and I have
always been uncomfortable with the concept that the Cypress
cluster was sin.,ly "bypassed" in the late 1600s and early
1700s.
Continued research into the route and effects of the
1539-1543 De Soto expedition across the southeastern United
States (cf. Brain 1985; Hudson 1985, 1986, 1988; Schambach
1989) has provided the evidence for a more tenable explana­
tion of the absence of the Cypress cluster from seventeenth
and eighteenth century European accounts. Reconstruction of
the route through northeast Texas and the locations of abo­
232

riginal groups encountered have always been probLematic, as
the most detailed account (the Ranjel narrative) terminates
in central Arkansas. The expedition was on its last leg by
the time it reached Texas, and was moving about erratically
(Schambach 1989: 10). The most recent reconstruction (Schamb­
ach 1989: Fig. 2) of the route of De Soto's army through
northeast Texas in 1542 (by then under the command of Luis de
Moscoso, following De Soto's death in Arkansas) indicates the
party crossed through the center of the Cypress cluster (Fig.
35), probably following an ancient aboriginal trail variously
known in historic times as the Hasinai Trace, the Cherokee
Trace or Trammell's Trace, which apparently crossed Big
Cypress Creek in the vicinity of 41T1110 (Wedel 1978: 3;
Perttula at al. 1986: 184). Far from being off the beaten
path, it appears that the Cypress Cluster sat astride a major
overland route between the Kadohadacho and Hasinai confedera­
cies.
Both Hudson (1986) and Schambach (1988: 20, 25, Fig. 2)
believe that the Lacane, which Moscoso encountered in travel­
ing between the Kadohadacho and Hasinai areas, were located
in the upper Cypress basin. If so, identification with the
Titus phase of the Cypress cluster seems to be obvious,
although Schambach does not make this specific connection. He
does however explicitly identify the Belcher phase as the
archeological manifestation of the "Naguatex chiefdom" en­
countered by the expedition on the Red River (ibid.: 20-23),
and suggests that the Texarkana phase likewise equates to the
Nissohone/Amaye on the Sulphur and Red rivers, upstream of
the Belcher phase sites. Turner (1978: 98-100) offers a
possible confirmation of the passage of the De Soto expedi­
tion through the Cypress Cluster, noting the occurrence of
"chalice-like" stemmed vessels and spoon· like ceramic ladles
at the Titus phase components 41CP5, 41CP12 and 41FK4, strad­
dling Schambach's proposed route through the area (Fig. 35).
Turner suggests that these forms, which do not seem to occur
in Whelan phase or earlier contexts within the basin, were
modeled after Spanish stemmed glasses and spoons observed by
the Cypress cluster inhabitants during the passage of the
expedition.

at present that the Cypress cluster existed as a viable
entity at the time of the 1542 spanish incursion, but that
the area had been virtually abandoned before the inception of
significant Caddoan-European interaction in northeast Texas
in the late 1600s. The apparent interaction with the Wichita
indicated at Culpepper and Ford is at first gLance puzzling,
given the late dates of Pearson and Gilbert, but it has been
suggested that the Wichita may have been well south of the
Red River by 1650 (Duffield and Jelks 1961: 74).
So what happened to these people after 15421 It is
apparent that the passage of the De Soto expedition through
the Southeast was disruptive to an extreme (Dobyns 1983;
Perttula et al. 1986: 186-189; Dye 1989; Murray 1989:49).
Treatment of the aboriginal groups encountered was brutal,
with many casualties in battle (or massacre), and the Spanish
subsisted by pillage. A more lasting and pernicious effect
was the microbial baggage the Spanish carried with them:
chicken pox, smallpox, malaria, measLes and typhoid fever.
Lacking immunity to these heretofore unknown diseases, the
Native American populations were devastated by epidemics
following the passage of De Soto's army. Perttula (with
others 1986: 187) has suggested that Caddoan groups in north­
east Texas experienced a resultant process of severe and
ongoing population decline after 1542, accompanied by the
depopulation of many areas and the consoLidation of the
survivors into a smaller number of sociopolitical entities.

It is therefore entirely possible that the Cypress
cluster fell victim to the De Soto expedition, in that epi­
demic disease so devastated the population as to result in
the abandonment of the area, probably by the early 1600s. It
is likely that the survivors gravitated to surviving communi­
ties in the Hasinsi and Kadohadacho areas, although the
components at Culpepper and Ford suggest that some of the
Three Basins subcluster population interacted with Wichita
groups to the west, and may have been drawn out onto the
plains. Swanton (1939) equated the Lacane of the 1500s with
the northern Hasinai Nacao of the 1700s, and it is possible
that the Naeao represent remnants of Cypress cluster groups
which moved south of the Sabine in the 1600s to join the

7.4.2 Mound Building

Harroun to cover a single interment (Sec. 6.3.7.4).

There are certainly striking contrasts between the mound
sites of different time periods and, during the Late Caddoan
period, in the mound bui lding behavior of the western and
eastern parts of the basin. The overall trends seem to be: 1)
a general decrease through time in the size and complexity of
the mound centers, and 2) the survival of mound building to a
later date during the Late Caddoan period in the eastern
extremity of the present study area, along the Red River.

There are no known instances of mound building in a
Titus phase context. The construction of mounds apparently
ceased upstream of the Red River valley at the end of the
Whelan phase (Fig. 15). However, one Belcher phase mound
component has been documented within the present study area,
at the Belcher site (16CD13). A single mound and an adjacent
low platform were raised, but there apparently was not a
surrounding occupation area (Sec. 6.2.1.2).

The largest and most complex mound centers on record in
the Cypress basin, the Hale (41TT12) and Mounds Plantation
(16CD12) sites, date to Early Caddoan Period 1. Hale covers
more than 85,000 sq m, and includes two very large platform
mounds and four smaller ones (Sec. 6.3.6.5). Mounds Planta­
tion was even larger, extending over an estimated 400,000 sq
m and incorporating three large platform mounds, a large
burial mound and five smaller mounds (Sec. 6.2.1.1). There is
a definite structure to both sites, with the mounds grouped
around an open plaza at each, and the major concentrations of
occupation debris tending to occur about the site periphery.
Two lesser mound components are known to occur during Early
Caddoan Period 1, the Thompson Mound (16CD32) and Mound Pond
(41HS12) sites, at each of which a single relatively small
platform mound was associated with an occupation area of
unknown size (Table 9).

To summarize, mound building during Early Caddoan Period
occurred all across the Cypress basin, and was character­
ized by both very large, internally structured, multi-mound
centers and by much smaller, single-mound components. Only
three Early Caddoan Period 2 mound components are known, at
the extreme eastern and western ends of the basin. All are
relatively small, single-mound components. There is a pletho­
ra of Boss i er and Whe l an phase mound components, but the
mounds tend to be quite small, and are very rarely associated
with burials. Mound building almost completely terminates
during the Belcher and Titus phases; only one small Belcher
phase mound component is on record within the study area.

Large, multiple·mound components on the scale of Mounds
Plantation are not known to occur within the Cypress basin
during any of the subsequent periods, and later mound sites
are seldom associated with immediately adjacent occupation
areas of any size. Three mound components are known for Early
Caddoan Period 2, at the Belcher (16CD13), Keith (41TTll) and
Garrison (41WD16) sites (Secs. 6.2.1.2, 6.3.6.4 and 6.3.8.1;
Fig. 12). In all three cases, only a single platform mound
occurs, although that at Keith was quite large (75 x 50 x 5
meters). Associated occupation areas are, again, either quite
small or non-existent.
During the Bossier and Whelan phases, mound components
are still quite common in the central and eastern parts of
the basin, but the size of the components, and particularly
of the mounds themselves, tends to be much smaller than
during Early Caddoan Period 1. Mound components are not known
to occur in the western third of the Cypress basin after
Early Caddoan Period 2 (Figure 14).

I f mound size may be cons i dered an i ndi cator of the
ability of some ranked group or individual office holder
within the relevant societies to command corvee labor, there
is certainly a strong suggestion of the steady erosion of
that ability through the Caddoan time span from an Early
Caddoan Period 1 maximum. Yet it is interesting that mound
building continues into the Late Caddoan period through most
of the basin, and into protohistoric times along the Red
River. It is clear that Late Caddoan sociopolitical organiza­
tion in the Cypress basin was more complex and intense than
Krieger (1946) believed, and that the sociopolitical "de­
cline" of the area did not occur synchronously across the
basin. That a more complex organization should have survived
along the Red River than in the uplands to the west is hardly
surpr1s1ng, given the role of the former as an artery of
regional travel and trade in prehistoric and historic times
(Joutel 1714; Swanton 1942).

Finally, it is worthy of note that there are hints as to
the settlement systems which produced the EarLy Caddoan
Period 1 and Whelan phase mound components. The existence of
at least two different sizes of mound component during the
former period has been noted: large, multi-mound centers and
much smaller, single·mound components. It seems quite possi­

In other words, there seem to be at least three spatial
clusters of Whelan phase settlements, cemeteries and limited
use areas, each with one or more mound components at its
center. This apparent pattern could be due to survey bias
(Fig. 5). However, this is just the sort of site distribution

achievement, and inherited rank is indicated. The number of
individuals buried in association with status markers in each
burial group (ranging from 4 to 12, mean = 9) suggests the
existence of a ranked class structure during both the Early
and Late Caddoan components at Belcher.

As noted, these data are entirely from mound context. It
is in fact remarkable that so few Early Caddoan non-mound
graves have been found within the Cypress basin, relative to
the number of Late Caddoan ones, given the concentration of

high status graves of the western Cypress basin appear to be
adult males in most cases. Thus, in contrast to the indicated
social stratification of the Early Caddoan and Belcher phase
contexts, there is a suggestion for the Cypress cluster of a
social structure in which high status seems to have been
limited to 8 very few adult maLes, possibly office holders.
It is certainly tempting to compare the two varieties of
archeologically identifiable elevated status with the two
principal officer holders of the historic Hasinai sociopolit­
ical structure, the xines; and caddi (Swanton 1942; Wyckoff
and Baugh 1980).
In short, it is suggested that a more complex social
organization survived into the Late Caddoan period in the Red
River valley portion of the present study area than in the
more westerly Cypress cluster territory. True social strati­
fication appears to continue into the protohistoric Betcher
phase, but the social structure of the contemporaneous Titus
phase groups appears to have been relatively egalitarian.
This contrast may be largely a matter of degree, however.
Both may have been kinship-based systems, with that of the
Red River valley having been more intensely expressed. Thus,
accession to positions of high status, and in particular to
political or religious office, might have been limited by
birth, perhaps to a single lineage. To the east, the entire
kin group might have enjoyed elevated status, while to the
west a particular kin group may have served merely as a
source of office holders. The proposed contrast is one be­
tween a system in which the kin of the office holder shared
his high status and one in which they did not. Such poLiticaL
systems could thus be quite simiLar to one another in basic
structure, with one exampLe simply representing a more in­
tense manifestation than the other. This is aLL obviousLy
quite speculative.
Only one of the known Cypress cluster components does
not appear to fit the geographic dichotomy of social struc­
ture proposed above: the cemetery at Lower Peach Orchard
(41CP17). Deep shaft burial pits are known to have occurred
at the site, some containing multipLe individuals. It is
possible that the graves also contained Galt bifaces and
Titus phase ceramics, but this has not been clearly estab­
lished. Until the material from 41CP17 can be documented, no
definite conclusions can be drawn, but it is possible that
the sociopolitical structure of the Cypress cluster was at
least locally more complex than the data from the better
documented components would suggest.

This is a very simplistic way to view prehistoric demo­
graphic change. Yet onLy one case clearly does not fit the
overall trend; that of the Early Ceramic components, which
seem surprisingly infrequent. It should be recalled that the
existence of an Early Ceramic period has been recognized only
in recent years, and that much of the LSU and SHU published
data are not amenabLe to the identification of such compo­
nents (see discussion in Chapters 3 and 4). It ;s possible
that the known frequency of EarLy Ceramic components underes­
timates their actual occurrence, and it seems likeLy that
some of the components cLassified as late Archaic are actuaL­
ly Early Ceramic sites from which no sherds were recovered
due to small sample size. Early Caddoan components may be
less readily recognized on the basis of a small sherd collec­
tion than Late Caddoan ones. The advent of body brushing and
applique substantially increased the percentage of the sur­
face area of ceramic vessels which is chronologically diag­
nostic in many parts of the Cypress basin.
It is perhaps the Preceramic periods which can best be
compared in terms of component frequency, as all are classi­
fied on the basis of variations in dart pofnt morphology.
Such data are more likely to be found in publ ished reports,
as a long-established dart point typology is in ubiquitous
use (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Particularly interesting is a
comparison of the relative frequency of occurrence of the
diagnostics of different periods at multicomponent sites
which experienced exceptionally heavy use during the Precer­
amic. The data from fourteen such Cypress basin sites are
sUlTlTlarized in Table 64 and Figure 37. A steady increase in
the intensity of use of each site from one period to the next
is indicated. It might be recalled from Table 52 and Figure
28 that the incidence of heavy use areas relative to limited
use areas progressiveLy increases during the Preceramic
periods. Thus, both the total number of components and the
intensity of use of individual sites increase from one Prec­
eramic period to the next.

7.5 Prehistoric Demography
It is not possible to estimate the aboriginal population
of the Cypress basin during any particuLar chronological
period on the basis of the existing archeoLogicaL informa­
tion. However, one can detect evidence of steady relative
growth in popuLation from one period to the next. Table 63
and Figure 36 examine the ratio of the number of identified
components of each chronologicaL unit to the length of that
unit in years. These ratios mereLy permit the comparison of
component frequencies between units of different lengths. As
can be seen from the tabLe, the ratios steadiLy decrease
through time from a maximum of 100:1 during the PaLeoindian

Future archeological research should begin with a work­
ing familiarity with the present data base. Sufficient infor­
mation has been gathered within the Cypress basin to permit
an efficient and fruitful focusing of research on specific
and relatively sophisticated problems. I hope the present
study will serve other archeologists both as a convenient
compendium of the existing data base, and as a source of
guidance as to major unresolved archeological problems within
the basin.

Archeological surveys should strive to avoid the mis­

It should be clear from the review of archeological
investigation within the Cypress basin presented by this
study that the intensity of subsurface investigation employed
by most of the major projects has been woefully inadequate.
One simpLy can not make a definitive assessment of an indi­
vidual site on the basis of surface indications in the south­
eastern forest environment, other than under exceptional
circumstances of disturbance. Detection of the mere presence
of a site is often impossible without extensive shovel test­
ing on most landforms, and backhoe testing on alluvial/collu­
vial landforms where sites are apt to be deeply buried. Such
testing should be incorporated from the inception of any
inventory survey.

Figure 36. The frequency of occurrence of components attributable to each chronological period or phase within the Cypress
basin is depicted relative to the length in years of each such temporal unit. For example, there are 40 recorded Paleoindian
components in the Cypress basin, and the defined length of the Paleoindian period is 4000 years (Table 8); 40/4000 = .01. By
contrast, the ratio for the Belcher and Titus phases combined is 77/100 = .77. A progressive increase in aboriginal popula­
tion is indicated, with a relative explosion in population and site formation in Caddoan times. See table 63 for the numeric

Numerous research problems have been noted as in need of

No comprehensive review thereof will be made, but one criti­
cal data need should be emphasized. \.Ie must make a concerted
effort to record, by whatever means necessary and possible,
the remaining Caddoan mound sites within the Cypress basin
and its environs. These components are our most readily
identifiable keys to unraveling the sociopolitical organiza­
tion, social group compoSition and settlement system
hierarchies of the area during most of the Caddoan periods.
Many of the smaller mounds in particular, like those of the
Whelan phase components, probably have yet to be recorded. A
welcome step in the right direction is an inventory of the
known mound sites within the basin of the Sabine River near­
ing completion by the Texas Historical Commission (Perttula,
Gaither and Skiles 1989).
