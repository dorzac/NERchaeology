ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company conducted an intensive archeological survey along the existing and
proposed new right-of-way for the State Highway (SH) 46 widening (CSJ# 0215-02-029)
in Comal County, Texas. The survey was conducted in compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas (13 TAC 26) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (36
CFR 800), under TAC Permit #4200. The project is considered linear; the total distance
for the planned road expansion is approximately 21.5 miles, with a typical expansion
width of approximately 50 feet. The survey took place on publicly owned right-of-way
(ROW) and private property. The total SH 46 project area is approximately 515 acres
(330 acres of existing ROW, 185 acres of proposed expanded ROW). Archeologists
surveyed the existing ROW, plus all areas of the expanded ROW where private
landowners had granted right-of-entry.
Archeologists secured right-of-entry to
approximately 83 acres, or 67,000 linear feet (20.4 km) located on private property,
equating to approximately 40% access to proposed expanded ROW. The survey involved
pedestrian survey supplemented with 260 shovel tests, of which 30 were positive. Due
to shallow soils, backhoe trenching was not warranted. The survey studied accessible
areas adjacent to three known archeological sites (41CM47, 41CM146, and 41CM232)
and documented five new archeological sitesâSites 41CM296-41CM300.
Site
41CM299 is an historic stock tank, cut into the bedrock and lined with limestone
blocks on two sides. It is fed by a natural spring whose waters fill the tank through a
channel cut into the bedrock. Sites 41CM296 and 41CM300 are minor surficial and
shallowly buried lithic scatters lacking features and organic preservation while Sites
41CM297 and 41CM298 are expansive lithic quarry sites generally limited to the
ground surface. None of the prehistoric sites contained any diagnostics, or intact
features, thus precluding the need for further study.
None of the sites are
recommended as NRHP/SAL eligible. In addition, three farmsteads identified in the
projectâs Historic Resource Survey Report as NRHP eligible were identified and assigned
trinomials (Sites 41CM303-41CM305). Proposed expanded ROW adjacent to Site
41CM305 is recommended for survey once right of entry is attained. Improvements in
the vicinity of the other two sites will not affect them as they were found devoid of
NRHP-contributing archeological elements (Site 41CM304) or were limited to the
opposite side of the roadway (Site 41CM303).
No artifact collections were made for this project. All site forms and project related
records will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
In July and September of 2006, Hicks & Company undertook an intensive linear
archeological survey along approximately 21.5 miles of proposed SH 46 road widening
from 2,000 feet east of Loop 337, immediately west of New Braunfels to Anhalt, three
miles west of US 281 in Comal County, Texas. The existing roadway consists typically
of a 100-foot right-of-way with two 12-foot travel lanes in each direction and a dedicated
center turn lane over a small segment. The ultimate proposed roadway would consist of
two 11-foot lanes in each direction, one 14-foot shared use travel lane in each direction,
and 5-foot sidewalks in each direction. A paved median would separate the travel lanes.
The overall new typical right-of-way (ROW) width would be 150 feet, with more required
at grade-separated intersections (approximately 350 feet) and turnarounds
(approximately 240-260 feet, see Figure 1). The proposed expanded ROW varies in
relation to the existing highway as it meanders along the project length. In some areas
it is solely south of the highway and solely north of it in others and in still others it is
split by the existing roadway leaving a pair of very narrow (<40 feet) portions of
expanded ROW. The project includes a small, one-quarter-mile (400 m) connector road
near the eastern terminus. The narrow (60-foot wide) additional roadway will connect
FM 1863 with Timber Hollow Road. The projectâs total area of potential effect (APE) is
estimated at approximately 515 acres (330 acres of existing ROW and 185 acres of
proposed new ROW). The APE consists of all existing and new ROW, easements,
detours, and any area affected by the undertaking. The APE is defined on the basis of
current construction plans and schematics at the time of the permit application and
any subsequent modifications may require additional Section 106 action.
Funding for the archeological survey was provided through the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) with oversight from TxDOTâs San Antonio District and
Environmental Affairs Divisions who are overseeing the highway construction.
SH 46 crosses through a rapidly developing landscape at the edge of central Texasâ Hill
Country. Until recently the area was still largely rural. However, new development
spreading from San Antonio and New Braunfels has given the area a much more
suburban character, with dispersed commercial and residential development fanning
out from the roadway. As it extends west, SH 46 traverses virtually entirely open rolling
hills with gravelly, rocky shallow soils and frequent sheets of exposed limestone bedrock
(Figure 2). Variations in terrain are generally less pronounced nearest to New
Braunfels and near Dry Comal Creek and more dramatic near the intersection of SH 46
and FM 3159. Away from these areas, the landscape is virtually identical throughout
its length with predominant rolling hills and minimal level terrain. Away from the
developing portions of the roadway (particularly at the projectâs eastern terminus and
west of FM 3159) the survey corridor exhibits minimal modern disturbance, populated
with ranch grasses, cactus, live oaks and frequent (sometimes very dense) cedar stands.
Shallow sediments dominated the study area with shovel tests very rarely extending
beyond 25 centimeters and large expanses of surficial limestone cobbles and gravels a
common sight within the survey area (Figure 2).

Open Survey Terrain with Typical Surficial Limestone Scatters

Archeologists primarily focused efforts on those portions of the proposed expanded
ROW for which right of entry had been granted. As a result of landowner contact
efforts, surveyors had access to approximately 67,000 linear feet (20.4 km) or 83 acres
of proposed expanded highway ROW. All properties that could not be contacted were
considered the same as those for which right of entry was specifically denied. Since the
survey was considered linear, archeologists followed the accepted linear survey
standards for shovel testing within the expanded ROW (16 tests per mile per 100-foot
ROW). Given that the overwhelming majority of the new ROW is 50 feet wide or less,
most of the project area was surveyed along single study transects. In grade-separated
intersections and turnarounds where expanded ROW extended beyond the 100-foot
standard, surveyors traversed the expansion corridor in three transects, excavating
additional survey lines in accordance with the above-mentioned standards. Areas that
were found to be too disturbed or lacked deposition or ground cover were not shovel
tested. Through the course of survey within the proposed expanded ROW (including the
FM 1863 to Timber Hollow Road connector), archeologists excavated a total of 249
shovel tests and documented five newly-recorded archeological sites (Sites 41CM296Â­
300). Four of the sites are prehistoric (two minor lithic scatter sites [Sites 41CM296
and 41CM300] and two expansive quarry/workshop sites [Sites 41CM297 and
41CM298]) while one, Site 41CM299, is an historic spring-fed stock tank. In addition, a
section of the original State Highway 46, built in the 1880s, and its accompanying stone
fence (now demolished) were also briefly documented.
Since very little of the project corridor had been surveyed previously, archeologists also
observed the existing ROW, assessing its potential to contain intact archeological
sediments. Study in the field indicated that the overwhelming majority of the existing
ROW was in fact disturbed through extensive drainage and topographic grading
(throughout the corridor) and buried utilities (particularly at the projectâs western and
eastern termini). Archeologists excavated 11 shovel tests in the least disturbed portions
of the existing ROW and adjacent to known archeological sites and historic highprobability areas. None of these tests contained any cultural materials, instead

documenting subsurface modification that was not readily visible from the surface.
Scattered elements of Site 41CM298 were encountered on the ground surface along the
existing ROW corridor, however, those findings were exclusively surficial and were not
intact.
In both segments of the project APE (existing and proposed expanded ROW),
archeologists focused study efforts on areas adjacent to known archeological sites and
three historic high probability areas (see below).
Finally, surveyors assessed those portions of expanded ROW for which right-of-entry
could not be attained for archeological potential. Archeologists noted the existing
terrain, ground cover and clearly visible modern disturbance to potentially reduce the
amount of survey that would be required in a future study (should such an operation be
required). Several large portions of inaccessible expanded ROW were found to contain
indications of modern disturbance and other elements incompatible with site
preservation.
Those areas were mapped for inclusion in overall project
recommendations. Much of the unsurveyed corridor was found to require additional
study once access is attained.

NEWLY-RECORDED SITES
During the course of survey, Hicks & Company archeologists documented five newlyrecorded archeological sites. Of these, two sites are described as minor, surficial and
shallowly buried diffuse lithic scatters (Sites 41CM296 and 41CM300), while two are
spatially expansive lithic quarry/workshop sites (Sites 41CM297 and 41CM298) with
abundant early stage reduction debris and minimal finished tools. Finally, Site
41CM299 is an historic spring-fed stock tank with a spring opening and directing
channel hewn from the natural limestone bedrock. None of the sites are considered
eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHPs) or as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs). Sites 41CM296 and 41CM300 were both located
along shallow terraces overlooking dry creekbeds. Sediments in these contexts were
generally shallow, though deeper than the majority of the remaining project corridor.
Site 41CM300 was by far the more artifact-rich with more than 30 flakes recovered in
the upper 25 centimeters of five positive shovel tests. Surficial scatters of larger tested
cobbles and primary reduction flakes were prevalent throughout the site corridor. Site
41CM296 was characterized by only two buried pieces of lithic debitage (found at 0-20
centimeters below the surface [cmbs]) and surficial scatters of tested cobbles.
Sites 41CM297 and 41CM298 covered areas exceeding 20,000 and 42,000 square
meters (respectively). Indeed both sites are likely much larger, however surveyors did
not traverse far beyond the proposed highway right-of-way. Site 41CM298 was very
large and was composed of two distinct quarry/primary reduction areas connected by
diffuse scatters of surficial debitage and cores. Near the siteâs northwestern terminus,
higher on the hillsope on which it was found, artifacts transitioned to a more refined
reduction context with numerous later stage flakes and tool performs as well as
occasional, very diffuse burned rocks. Site 41CM297 is similar to 41CM298 with
generally a light, occasional scatter of diffuse early stage lithics scattered throughout
the survey corridor. A larger proportion of tool performs and early stage tools were
found littering the ground surface in this site than that formerly discussed. Particularly
large, tabular and bifacially reduced quarry blanks were noted in association with one
of these more dense scatters in particular. A karst feature observed near the sites
southern terminus could contain intact prehistoric trash debris, however none was
readily visible from the upper surface. Occasional sightings of a sun-pinked glass jar
and shards added a minor surficial historic element to the overall site definition. With

both sites, sediment deposition was very limited with the overwhelming majority of finds
visible on the ground surface and those items buried mostly found within the first 10 to
15 centimeters.
Site 41CM299 is a historic spring-fed stock tank complex hewn from the shallow
limestone bedrock. Extending over an area of approximately 2,400 square meters (60
meters east-west x 40 meters north-south), the site is divided into three contributing
components. At the eastern terminus is a six-foot (1.8 m) cylindrical hole cut into the
bedrock at the mouth of a natural spring. Extending west from the spring, a deep
channel (level with the base of the spring cut) roughly hewn from the bedrock leads the
groundwater toward a stock tank that marks the second (and largest) site element. The
stock tank is cut into the natural hillslope grade along the southern and eastern edges
but meets a vertical limestone block and mortar/cement wall along the northern and
western edges. Broad earthwork supports the tankâs larger, western wall while the
northern wall butts directly against the existing highway right-of-way fenceline. East of
the wall, a small metal pipe spillway directs overflow down a natural stone cascade and
off the property into the existing drain system across the fence. Archival records
attribute the tank to the Smithson family, the namesake of the community in which it
was found.
Three historic properties adjacent to the proposed ROW identified during a May 2006
Historic Resources Survey as NRHP eligible were assessed for the possibility of
archeological impacts (Sites 41CM303-41CM305). Right of entry was not granted to
parcels related to one of the historic farmsteads (Site 41CM305). Expanded ROW
within those parcels will be surveyed once access to the properties has been attained.
All expanded ROW in the vicinity of Site 41CM303 will be limited to the opposite side of
the highway. As such there is a low probability for impacts to NRHP-contributing
archeological elements at this location. Expanded ROW adjacent to Site 41CM304 was
surveyed and was found devoid of NRHP-contributing archeological elements.
Construction activities will not affect any NRHP-eligible archeological deposits at this
location.
Finally, relic elements of the original State Highway 46 were also traversed during the
course of archeological survey. Remaining elements of the historic road included the
original dirt roadway and demolished blocks from the roadâs original stone fence (now
bulldozed). Archival records indicate that the roadway was initially commissioned in
1888 and later adjusted and improved in 1936 to its current configuration. The short
roadway elements observed during the survey are assigned to the early roadway and
were abandoned during the later highway upgrades. They are now actively used as a
private ranch road. This roadway remnant is not considered significant for inclusion as
a NRHP/SAL.

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
Mason Miller functioned as Principal Investigator. The remaining field survey crew
included Jeff Roberson, Colin Vandergraaf, David Tapia, Nicole Fournier and Matt
Stotts. The full crew traversed all accessible portions of the existing and expanded
ROW and documented archeological sites in the field. Field survey took place from July
17th through the 25th, 2006. Survey of additional roadway elements (the FM 1863 to
Timber Hollow Road connector and improvements east of Loop 337) occurred on
September 26th of that year. Analysis and report production immediately followed and
proceeded through October of that year. All work was conducted under the terms and
conditions of the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (2005) among the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA), TxDOT, the THC and the Advisory Council on Historic

Preservation and the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the
THC in an effort to identify potentially significant historic properties prior to
advertisement of a proposed Public Hearing regarding the overall highway improvement
project. The field survey took place on state owned and private land. Since a ânoÂ­
collectionâ policy was followed for the survey, no artifacts will be curated, however all
field-related notes, drawings, forms and photographs will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory. The report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC
Permit # 4200.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The project lies in Comal County in south central Texas within the Balcones Fault Zone.
The Balcones Fault Zone separates relatively horizontal strata of the Edwards Plateau
toward the northwest from the more steeply dipping strata of the Gulf of Mexico Basin
toward the southeast. Generally faults within the Balcones Fault Zone in Comal
County are northeast trending, normal faults, and most are downthrown to the
southeast. A small percentage of faults are downthrown to the north, and some faults
trend southeast-northwest (Barnes 1983).
The geologic formations that outcrop within the project limits are Lower and Upper
Cretaceous in age. The Lower Cretaceous units include the lower and upper members
of the Glen Rose Formation, the Kainer and Person Formations of the Edwards Group,
and the Georgetown Formation. The Upper Cretaceous units include the Del Rio Clay,
Buda Limestone, Eagle Ford Group, Austin Group, and the Navarro and Taylor Groups,
undivided (Barnes 1983). The majority of the project is within the outcrop areas of the
Glen Rose Formation and Edwards Group, which are both limestone units. Dissolution
of the carbonate bedrock has occurred, which has resulted in the formation of karst,
which is characterized by sinkholes, caves, solution cavities, sinking streams, and large
springs. Direct infiltration of water occurs at the ground surface within karst that
recharges the aquifers in the subsurface.
Generally speaking, soils within the project limits are relatively thin, overlying fractured
limestone and marly limestone bedrock. According to the Soil Survey of Comal and
Hays Counties Texas (USDA 1984), the western portion of the site roughly between FM
3159 and US Hwy 281 is within the Brackett-Comfort-Real Soil Groups described as:
shallow, undulating to steep soils over limestone or strongly cemented chalk, on
uplands of the Edwards Plateau. Most of the central and eastern portions of the site
are within the Comfort-Rumple-Eckrant soil groups described as: very shallow to
moderately deep, undulating to steep and hilly soils over indurated limestone, on
uplands of the Edwards Plateau. A band of the Krum-Medlin-Eckrant soil group
crosses SH 46 west of FM 1863. These soils are described as: deep, very shallow, and
shallow, undulating to steep and hilly soils over clay, shaley clay, and limestone, on
stream terraces, valley fills, and uplands of the Edwards Plateau. An area at the east
end of the project near Loop 337 is within the Lewisville-Gruene-Krum soil groups
described as: deep, shallow, and very shallow, nearly level to gently sloping soils over
loamy, clayey, and gravelly sediments, on stream terraces and valley fills of Blackland
Prairie and Edwards Plateau.
The highway project falls within the Guadalupe River Basin. The headwaters of the
Guadalupe River begin in southwestern Kerr County. The river flows southeasterly to
Guadalupe Bay, which is part of the San Antonio Bay System. The Blanco and San
Marcos Rivers are major tributaries to the Guadalupe River. Surface water features
near the immediate project area include the Guadalupe River and several small
streams, including Blieders Creek, Dry Comal Creek, and Indian Creek. A few small
ponds were observed in the immediate vicinity of the project area. The project area is
located over portions of the Edwards Aquifer Recharge and Contributing Zones.
The southern part of the project overlaps with the Comal Springs ecosystem. The
Comal Springs ecosystem is the largest spring system in Texas and in the southwestern
United States (Brune 1975), originating from the Edwards Aquifer and located mainly in
Landa Park in New Braunfels, Comal County. The system comprises four major spring
runs that feed into Landa Lake and an undetermined number of smaller springs
present in the spring runs and in Landa Lake. The spring runs and Landa Lake form

the headwaters of the Comal River, the shortest river in Texas, which spans 3.1 miles
before its confluence with the Guadalupe River. From Landa Lake, water flows into two
channels, the original âoldâ channel and a ânewâ channel created with the construction
of a hydropower facility. The two channels rejoin 1.6 miles downstream (McKinney and
Sharp 1995).
The Comal ecosystem supports a constant flow of water issuing from the Edwards
Aquifer at the base of the Balcones Escarpment, a stable thermal environment, and
consistently high water quality (McKinney and Sharp 1995; USFWS 1996). Examples of
fish species found in the system include the fountain darter (Etheostoma fonticola),
largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), dusky darter (Percina sciera apristis), and
largespring gambusia (Gambusia geiseri) (USFWS 1996a). Common exotic fish include
blue tilapia (Tilapia aurea), Rio Grande cichlid (Cichlasoma cyanoguttatum) and redbreasted sunfish (Lepomis auritis).
Other common species include the Texas
salamander (E. neotenes), freshwater shrimp (Palaemonetes sp.), and several gastropods
such as Amnicola comalensis, Goniobasis comalensis, and the exotics Thiara granifera,
Melanoides tuberculata, and giant rams-horn (Marisa cornuarietus). Aquatic plants
include Carolina fanwort (Cabomba caroliniana), water primrose (Ludwigia repens),
pondweed (Potamogeton illinoensis), eelgrass (Vallisneria americana), and arrowhead
(Sagittaria platyphylla) (McKinney and Sharp 1995). Three exotic plant species, hydrilla
(Hydrilla verticillata), West Indian hygrophila (Hygrophila polysperma) and elephant ear
(Colocasia esculenta) have significantly altered the ecosystem. Several exotic snail
species also represent a threat to the system.
Endangered species that are found in the Edwards Aquifer around the project area
include the fountain darter (Etheostoma fonticola), Comal Springs riffle beetle
(Heterelmis comalensis), Comal Springs dryopid beetle (Stygoparnus comalensis), and
the Peckâs cave amphipod (Stygobromus pecki). Additionally, the state-threatened
Comal blind salamander (Eurycea tridentifera) has been found in the aquifer from sites
within two miles south of the project area.
Typical surface vegetation in this region is characterized by Live-Oak-Ashe Juniper
woodland interspersed with rangeland. Common species include Plateau Live Oak
(Quercus fusiformis), Ashe juniper (Juniperus ahsei), Mexican Persimmon (Diopyros
texana), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), net-leaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), agarita
(Berberis trifoliolata), evergreen sumac (Rhus virens), Texas mountain laurel (Sophora
secundiflora) huisache (Accacia smalii), mesquite (Prospis glandulosa), mustang grape
(Vitis mustangensis), tasajillo (opuntia leptocaulis) and prickly pear (Opuntia sp.). Other
portions of the project area that coincide with existing road right-of-way have
experienced modification to the extent that very little native vegetation remains within
or adjacent to the right-of-way. Some of the project area and adjacent properties not
already in existing transportation use consist of improved pastureland that has been
seeded with bermudagrass for livestock forage.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
The project area is located within the central Texas archeological region. Specifically, it
lies on the eastern edge of the Balcones Escarpment, characteristic for its numerous
prehistoric sites. Most chronologies for central Texas are based on four main time
periods, representing roughly 12,000 years of habitation. The sequence from Collins
(2004) is as follows: Paleoindian period (ca.11,500-8,800 BP), Archaic period (ca. 8,800Â­
1,200 BP), the Late Prehistoric period (1,200-400 BP), and the Historic Period (400 BP
to present). The 6,600-year Archaic period is typically further subdivided into Early
(8,800-6,000 BP), Middle (6,000-4,000 BP) and Late (4,000-1,200 BP).

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (11,500-8,800 BP)
Though previous theories postulate that Paleoindian peoples were highly mobile and
heavily reliant on big game hunting (Suhm et al. 1954, Hester 1980), more current
investigations have contradicted this model (Collins 2004). One reason for this is that
until recently, few Paleoindian sites within the central Texas area had been well
studied. However, work at sites such as Pavo Real near San Antonio, Wilson-Leonard
in Williamson County and the Gault Site in Bell County have shown that Paleoindian
peoples adhered to a more generalized hunting and gathering strategy in which they
might return to the same site repeatedly on a seasonal basis. Within central Texas
most Paleoindian sites are located along the ecotonal region between the Balcones
Escarpment and the Blackland Prairie, suggesting that these campsites were
intentionally situated to exploit a variety of resources. Faunal remains collected from
sites like Wilson Leonard, Pavo Real and the Gault site support this idea. So too do
lithic artifacts and other features. Paleoindian lithic artifact types comprise a diverse
assemblage derived from biface, flake and prismatic blade technology (Collins 2004), in
addition to engraved limestone, stone bolas and ochre. Projectile points typically
consist of well-made fluted lanceolate points produced from high quality chert. A stonepaved floor found in the Kinkaid Rock Shelter attests to an advanced degree of social
organization and stability (Collins 2004).

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8,800-1,200 BP)
The Archaic spans over 9,000 years of prehistory and is typically divided into
subperiods, which reflect changes in technology, site type, and density.
Lithic
technology changed radically during this time, from one reliant on prismatic blades to
one oriented more toward multidirectional core utilization. Dart points typically became
smaller and stemmed. In general it is posited that Early Archaic occupations were
small, widely distributed, and non-specialized (Black and McGraw 1985). Like the
Paleoindian period that preceded it, the Early Archaic people were highly nomadic
hunter-gatherers practicing a generalized subsistence strategy. Archeologists typically
believe that population density was low during the Early Archaic period, steadily
increasing into the Late Archaic.
Burned rock middens appear first in the early Archaic period. Burned rock midden
sites are considered to be characteristic of central Texas archeology (Black 1989) of the
Archaic period. These fire-cracked and discolored limestone rock features are found in
creek terrace or upland settings and have other cultural materials within and around
them indicating an open occupation site (Black 1989). Burned rock middens are
circular, mounded accumulations some 10-25 meters across, having a basic annular

CSJ#s 0215-01-025, -036, -037; 0215-07-016; 0215-02-029, -046

(concentric) morphology (i.e., a dense ring or rocks surrounding a distinct center and
surrounded by a thinning periphery; Black et al. 1997). The wide variety of plant and
animal remains found within middens suggests that these ovens served as communal
plant and animal processing facilities. Ultimately, it is believed that burned rock
middens are a consequence of perhaps hundreds of cooking fires that were used and
reused in one place over many years (Black et al. 1997).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (1,200-400 BP)
The Late Prehistoric in central Texas is marked initially by the replacement of the dart
and atlatl with the bow and arrow (Johnson 1995). Larger dart points are replaced by
small, thin arrow points. Typical types found in central Texas include Scallorn and
Perdiz. Biface technology appears to lose importance, while other lithic tool types, such
as unifacial end scrapers, flake tools, alternately beveled knives, and drills occur more
frequently on Late Prehistoric sites. Despite this shift in technology, there is every
indication that a broad-based hunting and gathering subsistence persisted into the Late
Prehistoric period, though groups seem to have been less mobile, frequently returning
to campsites on a seasonal basis. Pottery appears for the first time on Late Prehistoric
sites in central Texas. Central Texas pottery was typically made of sandy paste, and
tempered with bone or shell.

HISTORIC PERIOD (400 BP TO PRESENT)
The Tonkawa and Waco Indians occupied the project area at the start of the Historic
Period. Explorers recount Waco Indians camp along springs located north of New
Braunfels, and there was Tonkawa village on the Guadalupe just above New Braunfels.
Interaction between Europeans and these groups was relatively peaceful, though threat
from Comanche raiders continued into the 1850s (Greene, Comal County 2001).
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Spanish and French expeditions
commonly passed through the area that later became southeastern Comal County. The
1691 Camino de los Tejas appears to have passed through the immediate area through
the Comal River valley, crossing the Guadalupe at the east end of present day
Nacogdoches Street. The area was noted during the Teran de los Rios excursion in
1691, by St. Denis in 1714, the Alarcon expedition in 1718-19 (Haas 1968, McGraw,
Clark and Robbins 1998). These references include the trips of Salinas Varona 1693,
and Ramon in 1716, establishing a firm route for the road to Nacogdoches. Spanish
missionaries established the Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe Mission along the
Guadalupe River near present day New Braunfels around 1756. This mission was
originally established as the San Xavier de Horcasitas on the San Gabriel River in
Milam County. However, threats from French traders and explorers, lack of interest
among the indigenous Caddoan populations, a smallpox epidemic, and various other
misfortunes plagued the mission community. In 1755, 41 Indians, Fray Mariano, and
Fray Ortiz moved the mission without permission from the Spanish government to San
Marcos springs in San Marcos (Bolton 1970). The following year they again moved the
site unofficially to Comal Springs on the Guadalupe (known to us as Comal) River. The
mission remained there for less than two years before it was abandoned permanently.
Though a marker for the site lies adjacent to the SH 46 roadway within the project area,
the actual mission site has never been confirmed (see below).
By the mid-nineteenth century the Comal Springs area had been claimed by Juan
Martin Veramendi who also had claims to San Marcos Springs and San Pedro Springs.
Veramnedi, however, never occupied this property. Permanent settlement of the county
began in 1845 when Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels secured title to over 1,000 acres of

the Veramendi grant, including the Comal River and Springs, for the Adesverein.
Comal County was formed in March 1846 from the Eighth Precinct of Bexar County
with New Braunfels as the county seat. In the 1840s and 1850s the area around New
Braunfels witnessed an influx of both German and American settlers attracted to the
rich farm and ranch land. It is estimated that New Braunfels was the fourth largest city
in Texas in 1850. One traveler wrote in 1850 that the city âis situatedâ¦within a
beautiful and picturesque country, abounding with water power, which the Germans
have improved for establishing manufactories of various kinds. (Rankin 1966). County
population rose between 1850 and 1860 and by the eve of the Civil War numbered over
4,000 (Greene Comal County 2001).
Hueco Springs (or Waco Springs), four miles north of New Braunfels, was settled in
1847 when several German families located on the west bank of the Guadalupe River
near springs at what was known as an old Waco Indians campground (Greene Waco
Springs 2001).
Apart from New Braunfels, there are three historic communities located within the
project area. These are the Valley View community (settled late nineteenth century), the
Smithson Valley community (settled 1856), and Anhalt (settled in the 1870s; Haas
1968). The Smithson Valley School (built in 1875) is shown on the 1936 Comal County
road map and on the 1929 USGS Smithson Valley Quad as being located on the north
side of SH 46 near the roadway. The Ufnau School, shown on the same maps, served
the Anhalt community (Haas 1968).
German influence on the social and cultural life of Comal County endured even with the
influx of Mexican immigrants during and after the Mexican Revolution. According to
the 1890 census, 75 percent of the county population was German. The flow of
German immigrants slowed after the Civil War and by 1940 only 1.6 percent of county
residents were native German. County population reached an estimated total of 8,824
in 1920 (Greene Comal County 2001).
Comal County grew rapidly after World War II. With approximately 16,300 residents in
1950, county population expanded by 21 percent in next decade, reaching
approximately 24,000 by 1970 (Greene Comal County 2001). In 1947 New Braunfels
incorporated eight suburbs into the city limits (Greene New Braunfels 2001).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Apart from a 2001 pipeline survey that paralleled the existing right-of-way between
Smithson Valley Road (FM 3159) and Stahl Road, the project area is largely
unsurveyed. Intersecting/adjacent surveys that contact the current project corridor
include three highway surveys, a sewer line improvement survey and an LCRA electrical
upgrade survey.

PREVIOUSLY-RECORDED SITES
According to records at TARL, there are three previously recorded sites within 1/4âmile
of the project areaâ41CM47, 41CM146 and 41CM232. Site 41CM47 is an historic (ca.
1870) German church, located approximately three miles northwest of New Braunfels
and 1,200 feet southwest of SH 46. It was recommended for testing when it was
recorded in 1966. A housing development now occupies the know site area. Site
41CM146 is a lithic procurement locale located approximately 500 feet east of SH 46,
approximately 2.5 miles southeast of Valley View. It was recorded in 1983 as part of an
LCRA electrical transmission line survey running from Zorn to Comfort. It is not

considered eligible for NRHP-listing. Site 41CM232, an Early to Middle Archaic
campsite, was recorded in 1999 by an avocational archeologist who reported finding
over 100 complete and broken points, bifaces, a mano, hand axes, cores and debitage at
the site. The site is located approximately 500 feet south of SH 46, in Valley View on a
hilltop overlooking an intermittent branch of Dry Comal Creek. No eligibility
determination has been made regarding the site. No listed archeological historic
properties nor sites have been previously recorded within the proposed APE (including
the existing ROW).

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Through the course of archeological survey along the proposed expansion of State
Highway 46, Hicks & Company archeologists traversed approximately 12.3 linear miles
of new ROW along the east and west-bound sides of 21 miles of highway, observing a
total area of approximately 78.2 acres (Plates 1-11). In addition, a one-third mile long
segment of proposed ROW slated for a connector road at the FM 1863 intersection was
also surveyed covering an additional 4.5 acres of new ROW along one-quarter mile of
open fields. Following specific standards laid out by the Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) for linear archeological surveys, archeologists excavated a total of 260 shovel tests
with 30 being positive for cultural materials. Due to the paucity of deep alluvial
sediments along the project corridor, backhoe trenching was not employed. A total of
five new archeological sites were recorded during the course of study and areas
adjacent to two of three known sites were examined with somewhat mixed results (areas
adjacent to 41CM47, the historic church site, were too highly disturbed by a housing
development to warrant on-site investigation). Below is a brief summary of the findings
made in the field along the full 21-mile project corridor. To ease in discussion, the
corridor has been divided into four segments from east to west, delineated by major
highway intersections: from 2,000 feet east of Loop 337 in New Braunfels to the FM
2722 intersection, from the FM 2722 intersection to FM 3159, from FM 3159 to US
Highway 281 and from US Highway 281 to the western terminus at Bulverde Road.

EXISTING RIGHT-OF-WAY
Archeologists surveyed the SH 46 highwayâs existing ROW during the course of the field
study. Modern disturbance was readily evident throughout the corridor with generally
nominal opportunity for intact cultural sediments. Along the highwayâs full length,
archeologists noted moderate to extensive drainage grading with concrete culverts
beneath access drives (Figure 3). In other, more dramatically varied topographic
contexts, the existing ROW was artificially leveled with man-made hillslopes and steep
grade-separated hillside cuts. Natural, intact ROW ground surfaces were limited to the
minimum required to solidly maintain the property fenceline (Figure 4).
Where topography was level, modern existing ROW disturbance was also noted with the
presence of numerous buried utility markers, particularly between Loop 337 and FM
2722 and all areas west of FM 3159. These most populated and developed portions
contained the greatest density of buried utility markers (Figures 3 and 5). All portions
of the existing ROW in these areas are clearly heavily disturbed and lack any possibility
of containing intact archeological sediments. However, utility markers were noted in
the least developed areas as well (Figure 5). The 2,000 feet (600 m) of improvements
east of Loop 337 were the most disturbed with abundant utility markers and adjacent
construction (Figure 5a).

Existing Right-of-Way Disturbance in Segment 4

Given the abundant disturbance through the existing ROW corridor, shovel testing was
generally limited. Archeologists excavated a total of 11 negative shovel tests within the
existing ROW, in areas that were the least disturbed or were adjacent to known
archeological sites or historic high probability areas. All shovel tests were negative for
cultural materials. In the existing ROW nearest to Site 41CM146, archeologists placed
three shovel tests (Tests A14, B14 and B15, Figure 6) while historic high probability
areas such as the existing ROW adjacent to the old Smithson Valley School were also
tested (Shovel Tests C16 and 17). Tests revealed a highly modified subsurface with
modern debris (glass) well below the ground surface. Efforts were made to assess the
potential for graves to be found within the existing ROW adjacent to the Letsch
Cemetery (access was not granted onto the property containing the actual cemetery, see
below) however the area was densely vegetated and highly disturbed by drainage
grading (Plate 10, Figure 7). The cemetery was in generally poor condition. One
shovel test excavated within the existing ROW immediately north of the cemetery (Test
6) contained clear indications of highway disturbance and lacked any evidence of
possible burials within the ROW. Within the soil column, archeologists encountered
approximately 30 centimeters of very gravelly mottled gray silty clay overlying
introduced, mottled yellowish tan clay that extended through the terminus of the shovel
test.
Citing clear highway-related disturbance the test was terminated at 40
centimeters in impermeable mottled clays. Since the surrounding existing ROW in the
vicinity of the cemetery appeared similarly highly modified by highway construction and
drainage grading no additional tests were warranted. Approximately five headstones
were visible from the existing ROW approximately 20 to 30 meters south of the
fenceline.

PROPOSED EXPANDED RIGHT-OF-WAY
To study the proposed expanded ROW, archeologists surveyed on foot all areas where
right of entry had been granted. Since the majority of the expansion corridor width was
50 feet or less, surveyors generally traversed the study area along one transect. Those
portions that exceeded this dimension were transected accordingly. Below is a brief
discussion of the results of survey along expanded portions of right-of-way within the
four arbitrary survey segments beginning at the projectâs eastern terminus and
proceeding west to the expansionâs terminus west of US 281.

SEGMENT 1: LOOP 337 TO FM 2722
Segment 1 measured approximately 5.8 km (3.6 miles) with approximately 13,875
linear feet (4.2 km) of expanded right-of-way along the both the east and west-bound
sides of SH 46 (Plates 1 and 2; since all improvements east of Loop 337 are limited to
the existing ROW, this area is not included with this portion of the segment discussion).
The terrain along this portion of the survey corridor is generally level to slightly rolling
at the eastern terminus, gradually transitioning to more pronounced hills toward the
west. Natural vegetation such as cedars, open range grasses and live oaks were limited
mostly to the western 1/3 of the segment, the least disturbed portion of Segment 1.
Including a 2,200 foot (670 m) segment of 150-foot wide (45 m) expanded ROW along
Blieders Creek, archeologists surveyed an estimated total of approximately 14.9 acres
and excavated a total of 44 shovel tests. Of those, seven (Tests B65-67, 72, 74-76) were
positive. All were associated with newly recorded Site 41CM298, a lithic
quarry/workshop site spanning the northern and southern branches of Blieders Creek
(see Site Discussions).
Typical shovel test columns in Segment 1 were very shallow, rarely extending beyond 20
centimeters. Soils were typically 7.5YR3/3 dark brown rocky, gravelly clays and clay
loams immediately overlying limestone bedrock. Shovel tests at the northern and
southern banks of the northern branch of Blieders Creek (within the boundaries of Site
41CM298) encountered the deepest sediments, reaching 40 centimeters through soft
silty clay loam. This area was initially thought to contain the highest potential for
containing buried deposits, however, evidence of extensive, rapid flood-related sediment
excoriation as well as manholes indicated that the deeper sediments were likely heavily
disturbed (see Site Discussions).
Modern disturbance along this portion of the corridor was widespread within the
proposed ROW. Markers for a buried water line as well as accompanying fire hydrants
occupied the majority of the northern portions of the proposed expanded ROW in this
section while buried gas line markers within the expansion corridor were also noted
near the eastern terminus. Shovel testing was limited within these disturbed
segments. New construction not visible on Plates 1 and 2 was also extensive while
residential grading was frequently noted (Figures 3, and 5a, 8).

Particular efforts were made to explore the historic high probability area related to the
possible location of the eighteenth century San Francisco Xavier Mission on the
Guadalupe, which according to a 1936 historical marker that stands near the projectâs
eastern terminus (adjacent to Shovel Tests B49 and B50, Figure 9), could lie in the
project vicinity. The marker identifies itself as the unofficial site of the mission dating
to the mid-1750s. The mission, originally located along the San Gabriel River in Milam
County and later moved to the Comal Springs area, housed up to 41 Indians during its
short period of occupation. By 1758, the mission was abandoned and very little
documentation of the site remains (Castaneda 1938, Bolton 1970). Specific locational
data is contradictory as a second San Francisco Xavier Mission marker at another
location contradicts the one above, placing it farther east, along the Comal River. The
tall, Mission Hill that stands approximately Â¼ mile south of the project corridor was
thought to be the site of the mission, however, the rocky, steep hillslope would not be a
likely mission location as access to croplands and water would have been limited. The
historic elements that do stand near the top of the hill are more likely attributed to a
historic stone chapel. Thorough subsurface testing and extensive surficial examination
revealed no evidence of the missionâs presence within the proposed expanded ROW.
The historical marker is considered NRHP/SAL eligible however it is slated to be moved
outside of the APE and will thus not be impacted.

SEGMENT 2: FM 2722 TO FM 3159
Segment 2 is the longest of the proposed highway upgrade corridor, stretching
approximately ten miles from FM 2722 to FM 3159 (Plates 2-7). The majority of the
segmentâs proposed expanded ROW is generally 50-feet wide, meandering wholly
between the east and west-bound sides of the road. The western third of the segment
splits the expanded ROW between the two sides of the road. One highway turnaround
(east of Herbelin Road) and three grade-separated intersections (FM 2722, FM 3009,
and FM 3159) expand the proposed ROW to 120-300 feet wide.

CSJ#s 0215-01-025, -036, -037; 0215-07-016; 0215-02-029, -046

Through the segment, the terrain is generally open with minimal modern disturbance
noted. Aside from an extensive housing development that occupies most of the eastÂ­
bound side of the FM 2722 intersection (Figure 8), and grading related to a Comal ISD
office building (Figure 10), there was minimal evidence of modern intrusion. The
landscape is typical of its Hill Country setting with gently rolling, rocky, gravelly hills
populated with cedar stands, live oaks and loose patches of ranch grasses and cactus.
Large sheets of exposed limestone bedrock and fields of surficial limestone cobbles
(Figure 2) were clear indications of the segmentâs generally shallow sediments.
Figure 10

Comal ISD Office Building adjacent to Proposed Right-of-Way

Of the full 10 miles of expanded ROW within Segment 2, archeologists had access to
eight linear miles (12.9 km) of properties, covering approximately 51 acres in the
process. A total of 172 shovel tests were excavated within the segment with 23 being
positive for cultural materials. Of those positives, 21 were located within the segmentâs
three newly recorded archeological site boundaries (Sites 41CM297, 299 and 300, see
Site Discussions for detailed description of site discoveries). The remaining two
positives were isolated finds. Soils encountered within the segment were generally
extremely shallow rarely extending beyond 15 centimeters. Shovel Test B28 was
typical, composed of 10 centimeters of 10YR4/2 dark grayish brown soft, gravelly,
blocky clay immediately overlying limestone bedrock. Soils adjacent to Dry Comal
Creek (essentially between the two crossings of Herbelin Road along the east-bound side
of the expanded ROW) were deeper, reaching up to 50 centimeters in depth. Test A45,
dug adjacent to the western Herbelin Road intersection contained 20 centimeters of
grayish brown silty clay loam overlying 30 centimeters of very dark brown compact
clays with strong brown inclusions throughout. The test was terminated at 50
centimeters in these clearly sterile clays.
Shovel Test A45 was among the two isolated positive tests in the segment. Located on a
low terrace, west of the western Dry Comal Creek highway crossing, approximately 200
meters north of the known Site 41CM232 boundary, the test contained a small (1.5 cm)

distal biface fragment tip in the upper 10 centimeters. A piece of modern glass was
found beneath the fragment in the 10-20 centimeter level, indicating that the find was
made in a likely graded/modified context. Three surrounding delineation tests (A46-48)
were negative for artifacts but did contain similar evidence of disturbance. It is likely
that the find is related in some way to Site 41CM232, however it has been too heavily
disturbed and cleared to conclusively tie it to the known boundary.
Shovel Test A60, also located along Dry Comal Creek approximately a half mile east of
A45, contained a single secondary flake in the upper 10 centimeters and no other
materials through its full 40-centimeter depth. Four surrounding negative shovel tests
(A61-62, C25-26) concluded that this too was an isolated find.

SEGMENT 3: FM 3159 TO US 281
Segment 3 extended through approximately 4.5 miles of SH 46 from the FM 3159
intersection to US 281 (Plates 7-10). Over most of the segmentâs length, the proposed
expanded ROW measures 50 feet wide and is split between the east and west-bound
sides of the road. One 130-foot-wide portion of expanded ROW stretches over one half
mile in length along the west-bound side of the highway, approximately one mile east of
US 281. Segment 3âs terrain was generally more level with taller hills through the
eastern 1/3 and a gradual descent toward 281 near Stahl Road. Vegetation in
undeveloped areas was similar to the rest of the corridor with cedars, ranch grasses and
live oaks with commercial and residential frontages populated with turf grass and
ornamental trees and shrubs.
The segment was among the more disturbed of the corridor with restaurants,
convenience stores and office buildings scattered throughout the proposed ROW
(Figure 11). New building construction stood as evidence of the areaâs expansion. The
most pronounced disturbance was found in the western third of the segment, beginning
near Stahl Road.
Archeologists were granted access to approximately 1.5 miles of proposed ROW (11
acres), the majority of which was found along the widened turnaround area. The
dominance of smaller properties within the segment prevented the surveyors from
studying larger expanses. A total of 23 shovel tests were excavated within Segment 3
with none containing cultural materials. Soils within the segment were generally
deeper than other areas, typically reaching more than 30 centimeters in depth. Shovel
Test B41 was typical with 32 centimeters of 10YR3/2 very dark brown crumbly gravelly
clay loam overlying 11 centimeters of dense, black clay with limestone gravels and
caliche.
While no shovel tests were positive for cultural materials, archeologists did cross a
short segment of the original SH 46 as it crossed the turnaround ROW from the south
then turned toward the west just outside the ROW boundary. The ranch access road
was notably more substantial than standard two-track ranch roads.
Following
immediately south of the road, archeologists noted a steady scatter of uncut limestone
cobbles/blocks flush with the ground surface and scattering away from the road. The
propertyâs elderly landowner stated that the road was the original SH 46 and the
limestone scatter was a stone fence that followed the highway but was demolished when
that portion of the road was abandoned in 1936 (Figures 12a and b). Despite thorough

surface inspection and nine shovel tests in its vicinity, no buildings or building
foundation elements or any other related materials were observed. The area bore
evidence of recent cedar clearing and burning, removing any surficial artifacts.
Researchers were concerned that the roadway may have overrun a mid-nineteenth
century route connecting New Braunfels with Fredericksburg (Reimer 1851), however,
archival records indicate that the road observed in the field was commissioned for
construction in 1888 and overseen by a Louis Haag (Haas 1968). Lacking any historic
context, no surrounding buildings and no period artifacts, the road and its bulldozed
fence is not considered historically significant and is not recommended as NRHP
eligible.

SEGMENT 4: US 281 TO BULVERDE ROAD
Segment 4 extends 3.25 miles west of US 281 to its terminus at Bulverde Road (Plates
10-11). Expanded ROW within the segment is much smaller than the rest of the
upgrade corridor, generally less than 20 feet wide, mostly along the east-bound side of
the highway. Only the eastern-most mile of the segment contained expanded ROW with
the remainder of the segment limited to the highwayâs disturbed existing ROW. The
expanded ROW was the most consistently disturbed of the survey with commercial strip
malls, grocery stores, convenience stores, schools and restaurants packed within the
first mile of the segment (Figure 13). Archeologists had access to approximately 0.5
miles of the corridor (1.3 acres) excavating five negative shovel tests in the least
disturbed contexts. Shovel testing was not attempted within the clearly disturbed
context.
Adjacent to Shovel Tests B35 and B36, surveyors noted fragmentary remnants of a
possible historic gate approximately 35 feet (10.6 m) north of the proposed expanded
ROW boundary (Plate 10, Figure 14). The remains of the gate include one standing
and one bulldozed limestone block and mortar pillar lying approximately 12 feet apart
in an east-west orientation. The standing pillar (which is the eastern one), stands
approximately 32 inches (81 cm) tall and is 39 inches (99 cm) wide and 16 inches (40
cm) thick. The pillar is composed of rough-hewn limestone blocks and cement. At the
center of the western half of the pillar, an un-planed cedar post rises an additional
approximately 10 feet (3.0 m) above the pillarâs top.
A concentration of nails
approximately 70 inches above the ground surface (1.7 m) likely held a sign. None of
the nails were of cut varieties and pulled wire nails were predominantly of later form.
The other pillar had been knocked over but appeared to be of similar construction and
dimension. Shovel tests were negative in the area and thorough inspection of the
proposed ROW revealed no neighboring structures or other roadway elements (the
current property access drive is located approximately 20 meters east of the gate
remnant). No structures are defined on the 1929 USGS Smithson Valley quad nor is
anything depicted on the 1936 Comal County highway map at the gateâs location. The
gate is not of unusual construction and does not bear any earmarks of significant
antiquity. Lying outside the currently proposed expanded ROW with no architectural
elements within the proposed ROW, the gate will not likely be affected by the highway
undertaking and is too damaged to warrant any further investigation.
Archeologists attempted to access Letsch Cemetery however were not granted right-ofÂ­
entry to the property containing the potential site. The cemetery, whose earliest
identifiable interment dated to 1890 and the latest to 1923, was described by Poerner
and White (n.d.: 9) as in poor condition and very difficult to see. The headstones were
noted as mostly fallen and illegible. Thorough examination from the existing ROW
revealed five tightly-grouped headstones approximately 20-30 meters to the south
(Figure 15). Shovel testing within the existing ROW revealed 35 centimeters of gravelly,
disturbed sediments overlying introduced yellowish tan clays (Shovel Test 6). The
ground surface was open and extensively graded for drainage while highway gravels and
road debris filled the existing ROW (Figure 7). Based on the abundant surficial
evidence of construction-related disturbance that was corroborated below the surface in
Shovel Test 6, additional testing within the existing ROW is believed to be unnecessary.
Since the cemetery is relatively small and appears to lie at least 20 meters south of the
fenceline, there is minimal likelihood that burials would be found within the existing
ROW.

NON RIGHT-OF-ENTRY AREAS
While archeologists were granted access to approximately 83 acres of the proposed
upgrades, a significant portion of expanded ROW (approximately 102 acres) was not
accessible at the time of survey. Efforts were made to identify portions of those nonROEs that potentially would not require subsequent survey through clear disturbance
or clear surface visibility or minimal deposition from the existing ROW. While minimal,
the generally 50-foot expansion within non-ROE areas was too wide to fully see in most
areas and ground surface visibility was generally not conducive to clearing un-modified
tracts. Clear disturbance, however was more readily apparent and one long segment of
proposed expanded ROW in particular can be excluded from future survey
requirements. Extending from FM 3159 to Old Stahl Road (a distance of approximately
3 miles), mostly along the east-bound side of SH 46 (the final 600 m shifts to the westÂ­
bound side of the road) is a substantial buried water pipeline that follows the highway
approximately 20 to 30 feet off the existing ROW boundary, near the center of any
proposed expansion. The pipeline had been surveyed and cleared in 2001 by the
Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (GBRA; see Previous Investigations, Figure 16).
Other larger disturbed non-ROE areas include buried water lines, gas lines and other
utilities within Segment 1, an electrical substation immediately south of Site 41CM297,
restaurants in Segments 3 and 4 and a variety of areas of commercial and residential
grading throughout the project corridor (see Plates 1-11 [survey is not recommended
on any non-ROE property with listed disturbance]; Figures 8, 11, 13). A large HEB
Grocery Store in Segment 4 was also a significant impact to the limited proposed ROW
(Figure 17).

CONNECTOR ROAD FACILITY NORTH OF FM 1863
At a later stage of schematic development, TxDOT added a small, approximately oneÂ­
quarter-mile (400 m) long, 60-foot-wide (18 m) proposed connector road extending north
and east from SH 46âs intersection with FM 1863 (Plate 1). The short segment,
encompassing approximately 4.5 acres of new proposed ROW, will ultimately contain
one travel lane in each direction and one center turn lane and will connect FM 1863
with Timber Hollow Road. Archeologists had ROE to the entire length of the proposed
additional facility. The area is generally flat to slightly undulating with short grasses
and wildflowers populating the ground surface. Minimal modern development was
noted within the proposed ROW except for a buried sewer line near the southwestern
segment terminus. Five negative shovel tests were excavated along the additional ROW
through 10-30 centimeters of gravelly, rocky 10YR3/3 clay overlying sterile, reddish
brown (5YR3/4) clays. One possibly manipulated chert cobble was found on the
ground surface near the disturbed western terminus amongst several naturallymodified chert cobbles and âgeofacts.â Shovel testing in the cobbleâs vicinity (Shovel
Tests 4 and 5) and thorough surface examination indicated that the possible artifact
was an isolated find and not part of a larger, more significant cultural assemblage.
Conversations with Ms. Connie Krause of the Comal County Historical Society revealed
a possible âIndian burial groundâ that, according to local lore, lay somewhere near the
proposed additional roadway (Connie Krause, personal communication 9/18/06;
Plate 1). According to Ms. Krause, a local octogenarian woman pointed out a low
mound densely populated with trees north of SH 46 west of the Randolph Brooks Bank
and stated that her father had identified the somewhat conspicuous landform as an
âIndian burial ground.â As part of the connector road facility investigation, surveyors
located the mound (observed immediately south of the edge of the Timber Hollow
subdivision) approximately 800 feet (260 m) east of Timber Hollow Road and
approximately 75 meters north of the northern edge of the proposed expanded ROW
(Figure 18). Archeologists visually inspected the unusual landformâs ground surface
and found it to be a natural limestone outcrop. Only a very thin veneer of sediment was

ovserved overlying the bedrock. No cultural materials were observed in any portion of
the outcrop nor were any burials or evidence thereof observed. Lacking any indication
of cultural significance and isolated well away from any proposed impacts, there is little
likelihood that the proposed undertaking will affect any significant cultural materials in
this location.

SITE DISCUSSIONS
Five archeological sites were newly recorded during field investigations along SH 46.
Below is a brief discussion of the findings from each of the sites. The sites are
described in order from east to west. For all of the newly-recorded sites, archeologists
did not venture far outside of the proposed expanded ROW in their site study. As such,
lateral boundaries (particularly those associated with the four prehistoric archeological
sites) are arbitrarily defined at the ROW boundaries though they likely extend some
distance beyond this line.

SITE 41CM298
This site is located along the south side of SH 46 and extends over an area of 1,200
meters within the proposed right-of-way expansion (Plates 1 and 2, Figure 19). The
width of the proposed right-of-way expansion in this area varies from 15 meters in the
eastern half of the site to approximately 50 meters through the western half. The site is
located in an upland setting and is intersected by two crossings of Blieders Creek
(Figure 20a and b). The elevation of the site ranges between 244 meters and 265
meters AMSL. Cedar motts and briars dominate the site with short grass occurring in
previously modified areas. Soils on the site are shallow and bedrock and sterile clay are
exposed over a majority of the site. Impacts to the site mostly are related to the
recreational area through which it runs. East of the southern Blieders Creek crossing,
numerous hiking trails meander through the proposed ROW (likely resulting in that
portion of the site being thoroughly picked over through the years). Near the siteâs
center (between the two creek crossings) the main property entrance has been
thoroughly disturbed and graded. Finally immediately north of the main entrance, the
ground surface is highly excoriated through high-energy flood erosion into the northern
Blieders Creek. Deeper sediments in this setting were compromised by the presence of
approximately 200 meters of buried sewer line (indicated by surficial pipes and
manholes) bisected by the creek (Figure 21).

A total of 29 shovel tests were excavated on the site to depths between 15 and 45
centimeters below the surface (Table 1). Of these 29 tests, four were positive for
cultural material to depth of 20 centimeters. An additional eight were located adjacent
to surficial artifact concentrations. The site is characterized as a broad, diffuse scatter
of lithic materials. Almost all of the identified artifacts are located on the surface.

Lithic materials at the site occur in small to medium clusters interconnected with
isolated finds. Two of these areas represent lithic quarrying activity approximately 300
meters northeast of Blieders Creekâs northern branch and one immediately south of
Blieders Creekâs south branch (Figures 22a and b). These quarry areas contain large
tested cobbles, primary stage flakes, and cores as well as notable bands of exposed
chert nodules eroding from the surface. The remainder of the site has a low density of
lithic debitage, modified flakes, bifaces, utilized cores, and a small number of burned
rocks. Artifacts are primarily concentrated in the northwestern portion of the site and
artifact density was estimated at five artifacts per square meter. No features were
observed on the site. Based on the low density of cultural material, a lack of subsurface
intact archeological deposits, the absence of organic material, and the lack of features,
it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site does not warrant inclusion in
the National Register of Historic Places. No further archeological investigations are
recommended for this site.

SITE 41CM296
This site is located on the north side of SH 46 along a low terrace adjacent to an
intermittent stream (Plate 3, Figures 23 and 24). The site is approximately 40 meters
long and 15 meters wide, at an elevation of 295 meters AMSL, within the proposed
right-of-way expansion. Vegetation on the site consists of short to medium grasses with
scattered mesquite and cedar. Soils on the site are shallow with bedrock exposed along
the opposite bank. The site is characterized by two flakes found during shovel testing
and a very small scatter of two surficial tested cobbles at the Siteâs northwestern
terminus.

A total of nine shovel tests were excavated on the site (Table 2). Two of these tests were
positive for cultural material. Artifacts included two flakes found between 0 and 15
centimeters below the surface. One flake exhibited reworking along one edge. Artifact
density on the site was very low and there is no evidence of features or organic
preservation. Two small tested cobbles were located on the ground surface near the
siteâs northwestern terminus. No features were observed within any portion of the site
area. Due to the low density of cultural material, the lack of diagnostic artifacts, and
the lack of features or organic preservation, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator
that the site is not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and
no further work is recommended.

SITE 41CM297
This site is situated on a deflated upland terrace between two intermittent streams
along the southwest side of SH 46 immediately north of an LCRA electrical substation
(Plate 4, Figure 25). The site is approximately 410 meters in length and more than 50
meters wide and sits at an elevation of 352 meters AMSL within the proposed right-ofÂ­
way expansion. Vegetation on the site is dominated by cedar thickets with greenbriar.
Soils on the site are shallow with bedrock exposed over the majority of the site (Figure
26). The site consists of occasional small surface lithic scatters and historic debris. A
karst feature measuring approximately 71 x 42 centimeters is located approximately 65
meters northwest of the substation fenceline (Figure 25, Figure 27). The karst extends
more than 30 centimeters in depth.

Karst Feature Near the Electrical Substation

A total of 22 shovel tests were excavated on the site, 14 of these were positive for
cultural material (Table 3). All shovel tests were excavated to the bedrock contact at a
depth of five centimeters to 20 centimeters below surface. Artifacts on the site occur
between five centimeters and 20 centimeters below surface and include early stage
flakes, tested cobbles, bifaces, a possible chert punch/drill, pull tab beverage cans,
mid-twentieth century soda bottles, and a sun-pinked clear glass jar (Figure 25). Three
possible burned rock feature remnants were observed on the surface at the northwest
edge of the site, however these are very diffuse and exhibit poor preservation
(Figure 25). Shovel Test D5 (Plate 4), dug adjacent to the karst, contained one piece of
debitage and one burned rock, however no features or more significant finds were made
in the vicinity. Artifact density on the site is variable and scattered, with individual
scatters having a density of five to 20 artifacts per square meter. Overall the site has a
low density of artifacts, however it appears the density of artifacts increases beyond the
edge of the right-of-way to the southwest.

Although there are features on the site, they are on the surface and exhibit poor
preservation. The majority of the artifacts on the site are located on the surface, with
some artifacts occurring in the top 20 centimeters of sediment. Based on the results of
the investigations there appears to be little or no organic preservation. The deflated
nature of the landform has reduced the potential for intact buried archeological
deposits. Due to the lack of organic preservation, poor site integrity, and a lack of
diagnostic artifacts, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site is not
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and no further work is
recommended.

SITE 41CM300
This site is located on a low terrace/peninsula of Dry Comal Creek along the south side
of SH 46 within the proposed right-of-way expansion (Plate 4, Figure 28). The site is
approximately 20 meters wide and 100 meters long and consists of a low-density scatter
of lithic debitage. The elevation on the site center is at 320 meters AMSL. Vegetation
on the site consists of tall grasses and cedar motts. Soils on the site are shallow and
impacts to the site are primarily plowing and erosion.
A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated at the site to depths between 15 and 30 cm
below surface (Table 4). Shovel tests were terminated at bedrock. Of the 12 shovel
tests, five were positive for cultural material to a depth of 22 centimeters. Artifacts
consisted of lithic debitage, modified flakes, tested cobbles, and a crude biface. The
central portion of the site was not shovel tested as clearly shallow sediments directly
overlying limestone bedrock were observed from the surface. A light scatter of lithics
(including a very crude biface fragment) were found on the surface in this area along
with a possibly worked rock nodule extending from the ground surface. Across most of
the site, the artifacts occur in a very low density except in the vicinity of Shovel Tests
C28 and C31, of which C28 contained 21 pieces of debitage and chert shatter within
the upper 20 centimeters of the soil column. No burned rocks were observed. Artifact
density such as this was unique to the survey corridor, however, adjacent shovel tests
did not contain nearly the same artifact density and testing immediately west of C28
was not possible due to an extremely dense cedar thicket. The accumulation did not
exhibit any structure but was rather scattered within the test, likely indicating
disturbance. No features were observed on the site. The deeper and richer soils that
make up the site coupled with a slightly humucky, piled ground surface in some areas,
is an indication that the site area had been at least moderately modified in the past and
had likely resulted in the diffusion of any possible extant features.

Based on the evidence of disturbance, the lack of subsurface intact archeological

SITE 41CM299
Site 41CM299 is an historic spring-fed stock tank, located approximately 150 meters
east of the southeast corner of FM 3159 and SH 46 at an elevation of approximately 399
meters AMSL. The site is situated at the immediate base of two prominent hills on a
gradual northward downhill slope. Split into three main components, the site occupies
an area of approximately 2,800 square meters (40 meters north-south x 60 meters eastwest and is limited to the extant tank components. No neighboring architectural or
artifactual elements (neither historic or prehistoric) were observed in the immediate or
broader vicinity (Plate 7, Figure 29). The site is situated in an open goat-grazing
pasture, virtually devoid of vegetation aside from short, dried ranch grasses.
The largest component of the site, the stock, tank measures approximately 35 x 45
meters, butting closely (~1 m) to the SH 46 ROW fenceline. The tankâs southern and
eastern edges were cut into the natural hillslope grade while the northern and western
walls were vertical, with square and rectangular limestone blocks one course thick.
Where they were observable, the blocks were approximately eight inches (20 cm) tall
and 14 inches (35+ cm) long. Portland cement mortared the blocks together and an
outer, smooth cement face covered the blocks along the exposed, water-facing side.
Adding support to these two stone and concrete walls, an earthen levee rose above the
upper face of the stone walls and was a maximum of 10 to 12 meters thick. The stone
wallsâ upper faces were horizontal and met at a point in the northwestern corner of the
tank (its deepest point according to the landowner). Normally the tank is up to 10 feet
deep (approximately six inches/15 cm beneath the stone wallâs upper edge), however
very dry conditions at the time of survey lowered the water level to approximately four
feet (Figure 29). According to the landowner, in his 12 years on the property, the tank
had never gone dry, something he attributed to an adjacent spring that feeds it.

Located approximately 30 meters to the southeast, the second component of Site
41CM299 is a natural spring (Figure 29). At the springâs exposure to the surface,
individuals have cut a 72-inch (182 cm) diameter cylindrical hole down into the slight
northward hillslope to a depth of approximately 72 inches (182 cm). The natural
limestone bedrock within the hole was extremely smooth with no extant tool marks
visible (likely smoothed through years of water seepage and mineral deposition). Along
the upper meter of the holeâs eastern edge, five to six courses of small, thin limestone
slab blocks have been dry laid to form a retaining wall, meeting the current sediment
grade. While solely filled with dirt at the time of survey, according to the landowner,
during periods of normal rainfall, the base of the hole is wet, slowly feeding the nearby
tank through a trench cut into the bedrock.
Bearing approximately 320 degrees from the spring, a rough-hewn water channel was
cut through approximately 40 inches of bedrock and measured approximately 36
inches (91 cm) wide. From its junction with the spring hole, the trench extended 8.3
meters west to its junction with the tank. Along portions of the trench (particularly
along the northern wall), the limestone bedrock had been cut back in a stair-stepped
fashion (either a result of the natural rock formations or purposely to make for easier
trench access; Figure 29). Tool marks were difficult to locate, however along the
trenchâs northern junction with the tankâs natural grade wall, archeologists did note a
1-meter-wide section of limestone that bore extensive rough hammering marks (Figure
29).
At the opposite side of the tank (1.6 meters south of its northwest corner), a limestone
and cement spillway directed overflow into a metallic pipe then down a jumbled natural
limestone cobble gully and north, into the highway drainage cut. The spillway was
composed of the same materials (limestone blocks and mortar) as in the tank walls,
sloping gently over the edge of the walls into a stone slab funnel that directed water into
the pipe which descended through the earthen levee to its opening at its base.
The property owner stated that the siteâs only recent disturbance was occasional tank
dredging and dumping of dirt in piles along the edges. One such pile was evident at the
time of survey (Figure 29).
Ten shovel tests were excavated in the immediate vicinity of the tank with an additional
five in the surrounding area (Table 5). None contained any evidence of cultural
materials. Shovel Tests C13 and 14 were excavated (respectively) in the spring cut and
water channel. Neither contained any cultural materials through approximately 40
centimeters of soft 10YR5/2 silt. Tests on the natural ground surface, surrounding the
tank routinely were much shallower with extensive gravels and rocks throughout.
Steep southern hillslopes precluded the necessity for shovel testing along the southern
ROW perimeter however surface inspection revealed extensive floodwash and minimal
deposition. The landowner mentioned very occasionally seeing pieces of rusted metal
that he has called wagon parts, however he acknowledged no authority on the subject.
None such artifacts were observed at the time of the survey however modern glass and
trash were seen near the property fenceline immediately north of the spring channel
cut.

According to the landowner, the tank is a somewhat prominent local landmark
associated with cattle drives during the peak of the practice. It is said that the tank
was a meeting and watering point for ranchers as they used the original SH 46 to move
herds through the area. The complexâs precise age is unclear, however the 1936 SH 46
âas builtâ maps for proposed improvements to the roadway do exhibit a spring-fed tank
immediately south of the roadway at this location. The tank is not shown on any other
historical maps of the area. From the 1936 highway plans, the tank was oriented
differently, with the angle formed by the two walls coming together at the northern
corner (Figure 30). According to the map, portions of the tank extending into the
proposed highway were to be removed prior to construction. That portion was
presumably taken out for the highway, leaving the roughly four-sided shape that is
present now. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that this tank restructuring
in the late 1930s resulted in the reorientation and refacing of the tankâs vertical walls,
as stone and concrete along both walls bore similar weathering and material choices
(this can not be certain, though, as access to most of the northern edge was not
possible due to dense vegetation and the tankâs depth).

Figure 30
Close up of 1936 State Highway 46 âAs Builtâ Construction Plans
(North Points down on Map)

The highway construction map lists a Benjamin R. Smithson as the tank propertyâs
owner in 1936. It is assumed that he is the son of Benjamin Franklin Smithson, for
whom the community of Smithson Valley is named. Benjamin F. Smithson is listed as
the parcel owner on earlier General Land Office maps (GLO Comal County 11467 [850,
920] and 11468 [849, 926]). Mr. Smithson, a former Texas Ranger, moved to the area
from Alabama (via Austin and New Braunfels) following his service in the Mexican War
and after marrying Augusta Vogel. Once in the area he acted as the fledgling
communityâs first postmaster (Spurlin 1984; Haas 1968). 1850 census data from
Comal County lists Mr. Smithson living on the property with his wife and then two
daughters (his son would not be born until 1861). Having died in 1904 (Poerner and
White n.d.), and his son following in 1936 (the same year as highway construction;
Cannon and Cannon 1988), it is unclear whether Ben Smithson Sr. or Jr. constructed
the structure. Irrespective of its original builder, the tank can certainly be attributed to
the prominent Smithson family.
According to Hunter (1985), New Braunfels was routinely a stop during mid-nineteenth
century cattle drives from the coastal plains, however, drivers stuck to trails east of the
present Interstate 35 corridor (the Chisolm and Shawnee Trails being the most
prominent; Hunter 1985, Irishman 2005). Terrain and vegetation was much more
conducive to safe cattle drives as the rough, rocky Hill Country in which the tank lies
would not have been good drive locations. There is some likelihood that the tank could
have been a meeting point for some local ranchers who would gather their herds for
transport to New Braunfels, potentially using the now SH 46 corridor to get there,
however, this is an unclear conclusion.
Overall, the tank is very interesting and of some local prominence. The stonework is
not of the finer chiseled German variety prized in the area, however it can definitely be
attributed to a family of local prominence (the Benjamin Smithson family). The tankâs
significance to the local herding and agricultural industry is unclear, as it may have
been a meeting point for local ranchers bringing their cattle to the larger trails east of
New Braunfels, however the area was not conducive to larger-scale cattle drives; it was
too rocky and hilly to safely transport cattle over any distance. Limitations to its

National Register eligibility lie in the absence of surrounding contemporary buildings or
other structures. Had the tank been found in functional association with historic
farmstead structures, its N.R. significance may have been greater. Finally, the tank has
conclusively been altered from its original composition, its northern tip removed to
make way for the 1936 SH 46 construction. This process likely resulted in the refacing
of the tankâs western and northern limestone and concrete walls, further removing its
original construction context, and reducing its National Register potential. The lack of
historic artifacts within any portion of the site area reduces potential for the site to be
eligible under Criterion D. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that while the
tank is associated with persons of local significance, and thus fulfills Criterion B, Site
41CM299 also lacks artifact assemblage and surrounding architecture and thus is not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or as a SAL.

HISTORIC FARMSTEADS
In May of 2006, historic properties surveyors identified a series of 18 historic structures
and resources that lay within the historic properties APE of 150 feet from the edge of
proposed expanded ROW (Hicks & Company 2006). Of these, four structures were
identified as eligible for inclusion as NRHPs. One of these properties is the 1935
Centennial Marker detailing the San Francisco Xavier Mission that is slated to be
moved outside of the project APE (and thus will be unaffected; see Segment 1 above),
while the remaining three are historic farmsteads. Trinomials were established for each
of these historic farmsteads and observations and recommendations for possible
contributing archeological elements that lay within the archeological APE (directly
within the proposed expanded ROW footprint) are each described below in Table 6.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Archeologists conducted an intensive linear survey along the entirety of the existing
ROW and in sporadic properties of proposed expanded ROW along approximately 21.5
miles of proposed expansions along State Highway 46. Areas to which entry had not
been granted were generally surveyed at the reconnaissance level. The survey was
completed by archeologists from Hicks & Company under the direction of the Texas
Department of Transportation during July and September of 2006. Within the existing
ROW, archeologists surveyed highly disturbed, graded and modified context with
minimal soil deposition and no potential to contain intact cultural materials. Eleven
negative shovel tests in the least disturbed areas and adjacent to historic and
prehistoric high-probability contexts confirmed this conclusion. Any construction
within this zone is recommended to proceed without any further investigation.
Within proposed expanded ROW (including the quarter-mile connector between FM
1863 and Timber Hollow Road), archeologists were granted access to approximately
12.2 linear miles (20.4 km, 83 acres) of private land to survey for cultural materials.
During the process, surveyors excavated 249 shovel tests, 30 of which were positive for
cultural materials. Through the majority of the accessible proposed highway expansion
corridor, the landscape was composed of extremely shallow upland sediments with soils
rarely extending beyond 20 centimeters in depth through gravelly, rocky clays and clay
loams. Moderate to good surface visibility allowed surveyors to have clear thorough
observation of the proposed expansion area, clearing the overwhelming majority of the
corridor for expansion. Possible isolated elements of one of the known sites in the
project corridorâs vicinity (Site 41CM232) were found along the projectâs crossing of Dry
Comal Creek, however, the finds (a possible distal biface fragment and a secondary
flake) were found in isolation of one another and of other artifacts as well as outside of
the recorded siteâs landform boundaries. No other artifacts were observed in the siteâs
vicinity. The corridorâs remaining two known sites did not contain any possible
extensions into the proposed upgrade corridor.
Five newly-recorded sites were documented during the course of survey along SH 46
(Sites 41CM296-41CM300). None of the sites are recommended for inclusion in the
NRHP or as SALs. Sites 41CM296 and 300 are very small, diffuse surficial and
shallowly buried lithic scatters with no intact features. Artifacts are limited to minor
early stage debitage (Site 41CM300) and two isolated flakes (Site 41CM296). Site
41CM300âs presence within deeper soil contexts has resulted in a greater artifact
density, however, the site areaâs varied ground surface and evidence of plowing/grading
is a strong indication that the site lacks any intact components. Site 41CM296 is
extremely minor with two surficial tested cobbles and only two small flakes in as many
shovel tests.
Neither site contained intact features and both lacked organic
preservation. Both sites are recommended as NRHP/SAL ineligible with no further
work required for either.
Sites 41CM297 and 298 are expansive, surficial lithic quarry sites with very limited
sediment deposition. While regular occurrences within the site boundaries, surficial
lithic scatters were moderate to light with 5-15 flakes square meters in the densest
portions. Primary and secondary debitage and early stage bifacial tools and quarry
blanks were the primary artifact classes within both site boundaries and no diagnostics
were recovered within either site. Site 41CM298âs deeper soils along both terraces of
the northern crossing of Blieders Creek could have presented the highest likelihood of
containing intact, buried deposits, however clear evidence of modern intrusion in the
form of a buried sewer line with manholes and pipes visible from the surface occupying
the majority of the proposed expanded corridor removed this possibility. Neither site

52

contained organic preservation and features present (primarily three hearth features at
the northwestern terminus of Site 41CM297) were too diffuse to warrant additional
investigation. Site 41CM297âs historic element is also extremely diffuse with only
occasional glass and metallic fragments observed in isolation of accompanying
architectural elements. Neither site is recommended for inclusion on the National
Register. Beyond their initial survey and documentation, neither site, contains any
research value and both are recommended for clearance.
Finally, Site 41CM299, the historic spring-fed tank is recommended as not NRHP/SAL
eligible due to its isolation from any related structures, its alteration from its original
composition during SH 46âs 1936 improvements and its lacking artifact assemblage.
The land upon which the tank is found was initially platted to Benjamin F. Smithson,
the man for whom the community of Smithson Valley was named, however the tank
also could have been built by his son who owned the land at the time of the 1936 SH 46
construction. While of some interest and prominence to locals, the tank does not bear
any unique elements of superior craftsmanship and does not conclusively fulfill
National Register criteria (aside from its association with the Smithson Family). The
tank has clearly been altered and any related structures or artifacts have been removed
leaving the tank in historic isolation. As such no further work is recommended for the
tank site.
Archeological assessments were also made in relation to three historic farmsteads
formally determined NRHP eligible during the undertakingâs Historic Resource Survey.
These sites were given trinomials (41CM303-41CM305) and, where possible, proposed
ROW adjacent to them was surveyed for possible contributing archeological elements.
Access was denied to expanded ROW adjacent to Site 41CM305. The APE near these
locales will require survey once right of entry is attained. All expanded ROW adjacent to
Site 41CM303 is limited to the opposite side of the roadway and thus presents a very
low probability to have impacted contributing archeological elements.
Finally
archeologists surveyed the APE adjacent to Site 41CM304 and found it devoid of
contributing archeological elements. This siteâs APE will not be affected archeologically
by the proposed undertaking.
Elements of the historic State Highway 46, commissioned in 1888 were also traversed
during the course of study. The slightly improved dirt ranch road and now-demolished
limestone stone wall were found in isolation of any related contemporary structures or
artifacts. While the road itself is relatively intact, its accompanying fence is not,
bulldozed to the ground surface presumably some time after the portion of the route
that runs through the current proposed corridor was abandoned. Conversations with
the propertyâs elderly landowner and consultation with archival data indicates that this
was not a historically significant route and the minimal amount of the roadway that
remains do not warrant any additional investigation.
Within areas for which Hicks & Company did not have express permission to access,
the majority of the properties are recommended for further investigation once ROE can
be assured (Plates 1-11). Attempts were made to clear portions of non-ROE properties
for which surface visibility allowed thorough inspection and clearance. While generally
thin, surface vegetation prevented sufficient observation of the full width of expanded
ROW. Certain areas of extensive disturbance were documented, particularly all
proposed expansions south of SH 46 between US 281 and FM 3159 and Stahl Road.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit #4200.

APPENDIX A
SURVEY RESEARCH DESIGN

APPENDIX A â SURVEY RESEARCH DESIGN
SUBMITTED TO TXDOT-ENV 07/06
This research design describes a 100% pedestrian, intensive linear archeological survey
along approximately 21 miles of proposed SH 46 road widening from Loop 337,
immediately west of New Braunfels to Anhalt, three miles west of US 281 in Comal
County, Texas.
The survey will take place on existing ROW and proposed new
accessible ROW currently in private ownership. SH 46 crosses through a rapidly
developing landscape at the edge of central Texasâ Hill Country. Until recently the area
was still largely rural. However, new development spreading from San Antonio and New
Braunfels has given the area a much more suburban character, with dispersed
commercial and residential development fanning out from the roadway. According to
records at TARL, there are three previously recorded sites within 1/4âmile of the project
areaâ41CM47, 41CM146 and 41CM232. Site 41CM47 is an historic (ca. 1870)
German church, located approximately three miles northwest of New Braunfels and
1,200 feet southwest of SH 46. It was recommended for testing when it was recorded in
1966. Site 41CM146 is a lithic procurement locale located approximately 500 feet east
of SH 46 roadway approximately 2.5 miles southeast of Valley View. It was recorded in
1983 as part of an LCRA electrical transmission line survey running from Zorn to
Comfort. It is not considered eligible for NRHP-listing. Site 41CM232, an Early to
Middle Archaic campsite, was recorded in 1999 by an avocational archeologist who
reported finding over 100 complete and broken points, bifaces, a mano, hand axes,
cores and debitage at the site. The site is located approximately 500 feet south of SH
46, in Valley View on a hilltop overlooking an intermittent branch of Dry Comal Creek.
No eligibility determination has been made regarding the site. No listed archeological
historic properties or sites have been previously recorded within the proposed APE
(including the existing ROW).
Apart from a 2001 pipeline survey that paralleled the existing right-of-way between
Smithson Valley Road and Stahl Road, the project area is largely unsurveyed.
Intersecting/adjacent surveys that contact the current project corridor include three
highway surveys, a sewer line improvement survey and an LCRA electrical upgrade
survey. Citing the limited surveys in the area, there is potential for unrecorded
archeological resources to be affected by the SH 46 Road Widening project. Prehistoric
archeological sites would typically occur in this area along hilltops, or adjacent to
streams and watercourses.
Soils in the project area primarily consist of RumpleComfort (RuD), Comfort-Rock outcrop (CrD) and Bracket-Rock outcrop-Comfort (Btd)
association series, which are defined by shallow (11-17 inches) loamy soils over
limestone bedrock. These soils have very little potential to contain buried archeological
materials. Sites tend to be on the surface or only shallowly buried in this area. There
are, however, very thin bands of alluvium associated with the projectâs few water
crossings such as Blieders Creek. While these sediments carry an increased potential
to contain deeper, intact site deposits, their inclusion is generally minimal within the
project corridor, only slightly increasing the overall potential for buried sites. The
project corridor is generally unaltered by modern disturbance with motts of live oak
separated by open pastures. Ground surface visibility is expected to be moderate to
good through most of the projectâs length
Generally regardless of project corridor sediments, historic archeological sites could be
present within much of the project area. In particular, an Official State Historical
Marker from 1936 near the southeastern terminus of the project corridor identifies itself
as the unofficial site of the San Francisco Xavier Mission on the Guadalupe dating to
the mid-1750s. The mission, originally located along the San Gabriel River in Milam

County and later moved to the Comal Springs area, housed up to 41 Indians during its
short period of occupation. By 1758, the mission was abandoned and very little
documentation of the site remains (Castaneda 1938, Bolton 1970). Specific locational
data is contradictory as a second San Francisco Xavier Mission marker at another
location contradicts the one above, placing it farther east, along the Comal River. The
so-called Mission Hill, south of the Highway 46 marker is locally thought to be the site
of the mission, however, no physical evidence is found at that location. This is more
likely the location of the remains of a small historic stone chapel. Despite the
contradictory locational information, the area will still be thoroughly examined for
possible historic elements potentially related to the mission.
Historical sites may also be present that are associated with the Valley View community
(settled late nineteenth century), the Smithson Valley community (settled 1856), and
Anhalt (settled in 1870s). The Smithson Valley School (built in 1875) is shown on the
1936 Comal County road map and on the 1929 USGS Smithson Valley Quad as being
located on the north side of SH 46 near the roadway . A total of 18 historic structures,
cemeteries and markers have been identified along the proposed SH 46 widening
corridor. Six of these are described as NRHP eligible properties including four
farmsteads with multiple contributing elements, one single-family residence and one
State Centennial Marker for the San Francisco Xavier Mission. The remainder includes
a historic cemetery (Letch Cemetery, 1890-1923, Haas 1968), four farmsteads, four
single-family dwellings, a transplanted restaurant and transportation-related rock wall
and bridge. These properties all contained elements that did not fulfill NRHP eligibility
standards of historic significance defined by the Keeper of the National Register (36 CFR
60). Nonetheless, the project APE in these areas will be thoroughly investigated
(wherever right of entry is available) by means of surface inspection and shovel testing.
Shovel testing will be conducted at a rate of 16 tests per linear mile per 100 feet of
expanded ROW width, in accordance with the THCâs minimum standards for linear
archeological survey.
Survey methods may vary from this standard in areas that
clearly lack the possibility of containing archeological properties (i.e. disturbed contexts,
areas of exposed bedrock), and/or in areas with excellent surface visibility (>30%
surface visibility). Given that the overwhelming majority of soils are expected to be
shallow and pre-Holocene in origin and sites are typically shallowly buried, backhoe
trenching will not be employed along the survey alignment. In the unlikely event that
field survey indicates Holocene deposits extend beyond the reach of shovel testing,
mechanical excavation may be eventually required. Investigators will record their
observations and the results of shovel tests through notes, standardized shovel test
forms, and photographs. Site definitions will comply with THC/CTA survey standards
and policy including additional requirements for assessing historical sites and
cemeteries (see below). All archeological sites identified within the proposed right-ofÂ­
way during the survey will be investigated by means of no fewer than six shovel tests in
order to define site boundaries relative to the project corridor. Specific site information
will be recorded on standardized forms and eventually presented to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for inclusion in their archives and, if
necessary, production of new site trinomials. Shovel tests will be excavated to a depth
of one meter, to bedrock, or to culturally sterile soils, whichever is encountered first.
Soil from all shovel tests will be screened through Â¼â hardware cloth.
Survey investigations will follow a modified no-collection strategy. Isolated surface
finds, and non-diagnostic cultural material found in shovel tests will be documented,
counted and returned to their find location, and not saved for curation. Diagnostic
material from sites only will be saved for curation at TARL. If present, these curated
diagnostics may be composed of both held-in-trust and state-associated collections.

The total SH 46 Expansion project area is approximately 390 acres (260 acres of
existing ROW, 130 acres of proposed expanded ROW), of which right of entry on private
property is currently available for approximately only 36 acres. Archeologists are
actively pursuing additional right of entry so this number is expected to increase by the
time fieldwork commences. All areas where right of entry has been granted will be
subject to shovel testing and surface inspection in the above-described fashion. In
addition, since so little of the project corridor has been surveyed, the existing ROW will
be surveyed on foot and supplemented with shovel tests at standard intervals where
warranted. Particular attention will be paid to portions of existing ROW adjacent to
properties where right of entry has not been granted. Additionally, the ground surface
within these no entry areas will be observed for possible cultural materials
(archeological deposits will likely be surficial within this region) or erosion or
disturbance from the existing ROW. This will likely target any follow-up surveys to key
areas, reducing the overall required survey acreage.
In terms of distance, the total area that will be subject to survey investigations
comprises approximately 113,520 linear feet by an average 50-100 feet of width. In
following the above described research methodology, it is anticipated that investigators
will excavate between 250 and 350 shovel tests in support of this project (taking into
account surface visibility, modern disturbance, site discoveries, etc.). The estimated
depth of impact is assumed to extend beyond any depth of human occupation.
Historical archeological sites will be documented not only through field efforts, but also
through survey level archival research. This research will include an attempt to
determine history of ownership and land use for each site through oral interviews or
deed research, and map research, wherever possible. Census records for individuals
associated with the site will be checked, and the names of these individuals will also be
checked in the New Handbook of Texas History. Should research reveal that historical
archeological sites might be associated with significant persons, investigators will make
recommendations for further archival or archeological work, to determine NRHP/SAL
eligibility.
The survey will be conducted in all areas of existing and accessible new ROWs. As
required by National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), subsequent determinations of
eligibility for any identified properties in these areas under Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) will be conducted by TxDOT in consultation with the
SHPO prior to the advertisement of a proposed Public Hearing, scheduled for October
11, 2006. All work will be conducted under the terms and conditions of the First
Amended Programmatic Agreement (2005) among the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA), TxDOT, the THC and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the THC.
The results of the investigation will be compiled into a professional report as required
under Chapter 26 of the THCâs Rules of Practice and Procedure and in conformance
with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (1966, as amended). The
report will describe the project area conditions and cultural background, existing and
newly-documented sites (including newly-produced site trinomials), ownership of the
site properties and NRHP/SAL eligibility of these sites based on the requirements of 13
TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1) and 13 TAC 26.20(2). In addition, the report will include
listed and mapped locations of properties that were not surveyed and recommendations
on the need for further investigations in unsurveyed areas and, if necessary, at site
locations. This report will be submitted to TxDOT-ENV and the THC for review and
comment, then, resubmitted following the address of any of these comments. All
archeological sites located during the survey will be recorded at TARL, and all project
photographs, records, and artifacts will be curated at that facility according to their

standards. Upon acceptance of the draft report by TxDOT-ENV and the THC, 30 copies
of the final report will be sent to TxDOT-ENV (20 of which to be forwarded to the THC)
to satisfy the conditions of the permit.
