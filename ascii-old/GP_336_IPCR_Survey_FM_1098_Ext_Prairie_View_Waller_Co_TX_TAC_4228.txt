ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC conducted an archaeological assessment on property
associated with proposed Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) road widening
Project CSJ Number 0523-01-025 in Waller County, Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit
number 4228 was issued for this project.
Background research indicates there are no previously recorded archaeological
resources within two miles of the project, and fieldwork consisting of a pedestrian survey and
cutbank inspection found the entire Area of Potential Effect (APE) greatly disturbed by
previous construction. Given the extent of disturbances caused by construction in the APE
and the lack of any cultural resources near the APE that might be impacted by the project,
HRA Gray & Pape recommend that no further work be required and that TxDOT Project CSJ
Number 0523-01-025 be cleared to proceed as planned.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), at the request of Berg Oliver
Associates, Inc. conducted an archaeological assessment on property associated with Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Project CSJ Number 0523-01-025 in Waller County,
Texas (Figure 1). The project involves widening of Farm-to-Market (FM) 1098 to 36.6
meters (120 feet). As currently designed, all improvements are to be conducted within the
existing right-of-way (ROW), which is 36.6 meters (120 feet) wide (Appendix A). The Lead
Federal Agency identified for this project is the Federal Highways Administration (FHWA).
The goals of this investigation were to determine if the initiation of this project would
affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to assess the
potential for previously unidentified cultural resources to be located within the project’s Area
of Potential Effect (APE). Texas Antiquities Permit number 4228 was issued for this project.

REPORT ORGANIZATION
This document is organized into six numbered chapters and two lettered appendices.
Chapter I, is an introductory chapter describing the project and report organization. Chapter
II summarizes research design with respect to background research and field methods.
Chapter III summarizes the environmental setting of project area. Chapter IV summarizes
recent cultural resources management investigations in the vicinity of the project in light of
the broader cultural context of the project area in the region. Chapter V presents the results
of archaeological fieldwork, and Chapter VI provides conclusions and recommendations for
the project. Project plans are provided in Appendix A. A copy of the TxDOT provided
Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) is provided in Appendix B.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project area is located along FM 1098 in the town of Prairie View in Waller
County, Texas. The project area is located on the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
(1980) Waller, Texas 7.5 Minute quadrangle map, though cultural resources on the adjacent
USGS (1961) Hempstead, Texas 7.5 Minute quadrangle map also had to be considered in
background research. The nearest water source to the project is an unnamed channelized
tributary branch of Clear Creek crossed by the FM 1098 within the project APE (see Figure
1).

Figure 1

Project plans provided to HRA Gray & Pape at the time of permit application
(Appendix A) indicated that the APE includes a linear corridor, that is approximately 0.88
kilometers (0.59 miles) in length and 36.6 meters (120 feet) in width (Figure 1). Within the
project area, FM 1098 is to be widened between 24.4 and 36.6 meters (80 and 120 feet).
The expansion will begin at United States Highway 290 and extend to Owens Road at
Prairie View A&M University. In total, this APE consists of 3.23 hectares (7.98 acres) of
land.
Existing project plans indicate the 4-layer pavement will be a total of approximately
55.9 centimeters (22 inches), and that roadside drainage ditches will be approximately 60.1
centimeters (24 inches) deep at their centerline. Therefore, the APE depth is expected to be
approximately 0.92 meters (3 feet) to allow for excavation.
It should also be noted that one stream crossing is planned over the unnamed tributary
branch of Clear Creek, south of Echols Street (see Figure 1, Appendix A) in an area where
erosion along the west side of the existing ROW may require bank stabilization. In the
immediate area of the tributary branch of Clear Creek it is possible that the project will
extend beyond the current project ROW. Those plans are not currently available; however, it
should be noted that some bank stabilization projects do not involve deep impacts. Rather,
the placement of riprap, planting of erosion resistant vegetation, and other filling techniques
may be employed to stabilize the stream banks. Since current bank stabilization plans are not
known, the APE in the stream crossing area for this project was considered to extend to the
water line of the stream within the present ROW of FM 1098. It was the understanding of
HRA Gray & Pape that at the time the fieldwork commenced, all existing ROW was
controlled by TxDOT.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Site file research was conducted by James G. Foradas, Ph.D. prior to the field visit
and included reviewing records maintained by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin, Texas, as well as consultation of on-line research archives maintained by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The field visit was also conducted by Dr. Foradas
on October 20, 2006 and required 5.5 person hours to complete. Activities conducted during
the field visit included visual inspection of the project area and the preparation of field maps.
Photographs were also taken of relevant sections of the project area. This short report was
prepared by Dr. Foradas. James S. Hughey was the Project Manager and edited the report.
Graphics for this report were prepared by Tony Scott and Julia Balakirova. Melinda
Mendoza-Scott produced the report.

CHAPTER II. RESEARCH DESIGN

SITE FILE AND LITERATURE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was conducted by consulting on-line research archives maintained
by the THC. Research objectives were to identify all recorded archaeological sites within 1.6
kilometers (1 mile) of a project area and all recorded historic structures located immediately
adjacent to the project’s APE. Literature searches also produced geoscience data concerning
the environmental setting of the project area, such as soil maps and geologic maps.

FIELD METHODS
Archaeological fieldwork on the project started with a pedestrian survey of the entire
APE. During the walkover, the bridge south of Echols Road and its approaches were
inspected and photographed and notes were made on copies of project plan maps and other
field maps. The project area was subdivided into three survey segments to facilitate photo
documentation and field mapping: 1) northbound side of FM 1098; 2) southbound side of FM
1098; and 3) bridge, approaches and unnamed tributary branch of Clear Creek south of
Echols Street.
Areas in the APE determined to be potentially undisturbed during walkover were
subjected to subsurface testing. Typically this begins with the use of 2.54-centimeter (1inch) Oakfield soil probes to detect areas of disturbed soil. If shovel testing appears
necessary in an undisturbed area, shovel tests are excavated within the APE to a maximum
depth of 1 meter (3 feet), or until culturally sterile subsoil is reached. All soil recovered is
screened through ¼ inch wire mesh, except clay soils which are hand sorted. Examination of
the project area determined that the tributary branch of Clear Creek has been channelized and
that riprap has been used to stabilize the banks, portions of which are now eroding. No
cultural resources were detected in the APE; therefore, site delineation, laboratory analysis,
and curation methods are not discussed in this report.

CHAPTER III. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

A review of the TxDOT Houston Area PALM (Abbott 2001), National Web Soil
survey data (National Cooperative Soil Survey [NCSS] 2006), applicable USGS and State of
Texas Bureau of Economic Geology geologic maps, topographic maps and aerial imagery
(USGS 1961, 1980, 2006a-b; Van Siclen 1991), and materials provided by TxDOT (see
Appendix A) was conducted to predict factors that might affect site visibility and integrity
during the survey of the APE.

TXDOT PALM
TxDOT’s PALM (Abbott 2001) covers Waller County and other counties in the
greater Houston area. These maps are based on a combination of data, including soil
associates, landform types, cultural and natural resource distribution, and historic and modern
land use data. The PALM is a cultural resource management tool that predicts the likelihood
of detecting intact prehistoric cultural resources in various topographic settings around
Houston. The model also recommends the type of archaeological survey stratify that should
be implemented for a given PALM unit.
For PALM Unit 1, surface survey is recommended, and deep inspection is
recommended if deep impacts are anticipated. For PALM Unit 2, only surface survey is
recommended. For PALM Unit 3a, no surface survey is recommended and deep
reconnaissance is recommended only if severe impacts are anticipated. For PALM Unit 4, no
survey is recommended.

PROJECT AREA GEOMORPHOLOGY AND SOILS
The portion of Waller County within which the project area lies is underlain by
Pleiocene-age sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments of the Willis formation
(Abbott 2001; Barnes 1968, 1974; Van Siclen 1991). The project area lies in an upland
dissected by the gently sloping alluvial valley of an unnamed tributary branch of Clear Creek
that is the easternmost branch of Clear Creek, which is a tributary of the Brazos River
(Barnes 1968, 1974). The project area is underlain by the coastal member of the Willis
formation, abbreviated “Qwc” in the geologic literature (Barnes 1968) which is locally
characterized as being deeply weathered, lateritic, ferruginous, non-calcareous, and having
loamy textures with minor quantities of fine to pebble sized siliceous gravels. The Qwc
sediments and soils derived from them typically contain abundant iron concretions (Barnes
1968, 1974; Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States
Department of Agriculture [SSS NRCS USDA] 2006).

5

According to the latest National Cooperative Soil Survey (2006) information soils
mapped within the APE consist entirely of Hockley fine sandy loam (Ho) and Wockley fine
sandy loam (WoA and WoB). Hockley series soils are very deep, well-drained, upland soils
that typically exhibit A--E-Btc-Btcv horizonation. Wockley series soils are very deep
somewhat poorly drained upland soils that typically exhibit A-E-Btc-Btcv horizonation (SSS
NRCS USDA 2006). Both the Hockley and Wockley series soils formed in the loamy
sediments of the Willis Formation of late Pliocene age under native vegetation of forest and
prairie (Barnes 1968; SSS NRCS USDA 2006). As would be expected in the deeply
weathered residual soils of the Willis formation, iron concretions are quite common in both
Hockley and Wockley soils, generally increasing with depth (SSS NRCS USDA 2006). This
suggests that the depth to pre-Holocene sediment is quite shallow in the project area (e.g.
Abbott 2001).
According to Abbott (2001: table 2) Hockley and Wockley soils typically have a low
geoarchaeological potential “or likelihood that the soil could contain buried cultural material
in reasonable context” (Abbott 2001:20). The APE is entirely located in PALM Unit 4
(Abbott 2001: figure 66, see Appendix A). No survey is recommended in these areas.
Examination of recent aerial photographs (NCSS 2006; USGS 2006b) of the project
area also indicated that the banks along the tributary branch of Clear Creek on both sides of
FM 1098 have been channelized by previous drainage improvements associated with
detention ponds east and west of the highway (see Figure 1), and that all of the property
within the existing project ROW has been disturbed by largely urban processes as well as
natural erosion. Disturbances visible in the aerial photographs included cement and blacktop
driveways and parking areas, drainage ditches on both sides of the street, and a utility line
along the west side of FM 1098.
Vegetation in the APE consists largely of manicured lawn grasses along the berms of
FM 1098 with the occasional ornamental deciduous or coniferous tree. Denser grass and
brush cover the vegetated portions of the channelized tributary branch of Clear Creek south
of Echols Road. The creek banks are covered with grass and dense low weeds growing in
between what appears to be riprap (see NCSS 2006).

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS

A preliminary search of the THC Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online
indicated that no cultural resources are located in or immediately adjacent to the project APE.
However, a review of the Handbook of Texas History online indicates that historic events
and historic individuals may be associated with the project area. They are most likely related
to the history of Prairie View A&M University, which dates to 1878 and was established on a
former slave plantation (Woolfolk 2001). Woolfolk’s (2001) synopsis of the history of
Prairie View A&M University is a good starting point for understanding the historic context
of the project area which is not detailed here because no cultural resources were detected in
this greatly disturbed project area (see Chapter V). For a brief summary of the university’s
history, Historical Marker Number 8110, titled “Prairie View A&M University” summarizes
the history of the university for visitors. The marker lies on the east side of Owens Road
north of the APE and across from the university.
The search of the site files also indicated that the bulk of recorded cultural resources
anywhere near the project are architectural. Six architectural resources (National Register
Landmarks; 99000611; 99000612; 99000613; 99000614; 99000616; and 99000617) lie
between 0.60 and 1.0 kilometer (0.37 and 0.62 mile) of the APE. These are all in Prairie
View and include Alfred N. Poindexter Veterinary Hospital, on E.M. Norris Street (National
Register of Historic Places [NRHP] Reference Number 99000617); the G.R. Woolfolk Social
and Political Science Building on A.G. Cleaver Street (NRHP Reference Number 99000616);
the W.R. Banks Library on L.W. Minor Street (NRHP Reference Number 99000612); the
Annie Laurie Evans Hall Center for Student Services on L.W. Minor Street (NRHP
Reference Number 99000613); L.C. Anderson Hall on L.W. Minor Street (NRHP Reference
Number 99000611); and Hilliard Hall on A.G. Cleaver St. (NRHP Reference Number
99000614). Evans Hall is the closest and lies approximately 0.60 kilometer (0.37 mile) from
the north end of the APE.
Similarly, the prehistoric context of the area is best understood by starting with Aten
(1983) and Patterson (1996) treatises on the prehistory of southeast Texas. Based on Aten
(1983:27-41) in the early Contact period the area appears to have been situated in a buffer
zone between several Native American groups, namely the Tonkawa to the west-northwest,
the Coco to the south, and the Akokisa to the east. The area may have served a similar
function earlier in the Prehistoric period (Aten 1983). Generally prehistoric groups around
Prairie View most likely were typical of regional inland groups occupying the Brazos River
Valley (see Patterson 1996).
This is evident from the lack of prehistoric cultural resources recorded in the area and
the general lack of recorded sites in Waller County. There are no archaeological sites located
within a 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) radius of the APE, and the nearest recorded archaeological
resource, Site 41WL21 (Iruegas 1993) is over 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away. Site 41WL21,

7

the multicomponent prehistoric and historic Liendo Plantation Slave Quarters Site, is situated
on a higher probability landform, namely the terrace overlooking the floodplain of Ponds
Creek. Portions of the plantation upon which Prairie View A&M University was founded
may also produce similar multicomponent prehistoric and historic sites. However, such
resources are not likely to be recorded in areas of the City of Prairie View mapped as PALM
4 due to their being obscured by urban processes associated with the growth of Prairie View.
Given the environmental and cultural setting of the project area and the paucity of
sites recorded in the Atlas in this part of Waller County (see Abbott 2001; Aten 1983), the
potential to find intact archaeological resources that may be eligible for listing on the NRHP
is low. In addition, resources are likely to be found at shallow depths within the APE and
much of this upland region.

8

CHAPTER V. RESULTS OF THE CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY

SEGMENTS 1 and 2: NORTH AND SOUTHBOUND SIDES OF FM 1098
Survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact that construction
processes might have on cultural resources located within the APE. The project area was
found to be entirely disturbed by previous construction, matching observations in recent
aerial photographs and predictions made in the Houston Area PALM.
Disturbances include construction of the highway and the highway bridge south of
Echols Road, including drainage ditches on both sides of the highway (Plates 1 and 2).
Within the APE, underground water lines for fire hydrants appear to be present along the east
side of FM 1098, overhead power lines are present along the west side. Cement culverts,
some of which are in need of repair, are present under and near many paved driveway
entrances. Portions of the drainage ditch along the east side of FM 1098 are paved with
blacktop near the ditch’s confluence with the tributary branch of Clear Creek by the bridge
south of Echols Road. These processes have greatly disturbed the entire APE along both
sides of FM 1098.

SEGMENT 3: BRIDGE, APPROACHES, AND BRANCH OF CLEAR CREEK
During the walkover the intermittent stream within the tributary branch of Clear
Creek south of Echols Road was flowing, possibly due to recent rains (Plates 3 and 4). In
addition, lower portions of the modern floodplain east of FM 1098 were inundated with very
shallow puddles of standing water or boggy, water saturated soil. It was also determined that
the stream had been channelized for some distance to the east and west of the highway
(Plates 1 and 2) most likely to facilitate drainage from a detention pond east of the highway
(see Figure 1). Concrete riprap and bank stabilizing vegetation (grass and weeds) was
observed on both banks of the channelized stream. Oakfield probes placed on both
landscaped banks of the stream upstream and downstream from the bridge revealed damp
alluvial fill.
Natural disturbances were also visible and included erosion of riprap and roadside
berms along the stream banks. Exposed cutbanks near the mouths of drainage ditches on the
east side of the bridge (see Plate 4) were examined from the surface to the waterline. No
paleosols were evident here or elsewhere in the area, and as mentioned above they are not
likely to be present in the area. Since disturbances for some distance up and down stream
from the bridge appear extensive, no subsurface testing was conducted in the APE.

CHAPTER VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The results of the site file review indicate that no previously identified cultural
resources are located near the proposed project area (see Figure 1). Evans Hall at Prairie
View A&M University is the closest architectural resource, lying approximately 0.60
kilometer (0.37 mile) from the north end of the APE; and the nearest recorded archaeological
site (41WL21) is over 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away.
Field investigations indicate that the proposed project will impact areas of existing
ROW that have been greatly disturbed by previous activities involving road, bridge, and
drainage ditch construction, placement of underground and overhead utility lines; and
channelization, rip rap placement, and other construction associated with improvements to an
intermittent tributary branch of Clear Creek crossed by FM 1098 south of Echols road.
The results of the site file review and the evidence of severe disturbance within the
APE, indicate that no archaeological resources will be affected by the proposed project as
currently planned. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological survey
work be required and that TxDOT Project CSJ Number 0523-01-025 in Waller County,
Texas, be permitted to proceed.
