ABSTRACT
Cultu~al ~esou~ces su~veys and assessments We~e
conducted in po~tions of Hidalgo and Willacy counties,
Texas, du~ing the pe~iod of August to Octobe~ 1980 by
P~ewitt and Associates, Inc.
This wo~k was accompl~shed
unde~ the te~ms of cont~acts with the Galveston Dist~ict,
United State A~my Co~ps of Enginee~s, and with the
Hidalgo County D~ainage Dist~ict No. 1 and the Willacy
County D~ainage Dist~ict No.1.
The pu~pose of the wo~k
was to locate, ~eco~d and assess the info~mation yield
potential of histo~ic and p~ehisto~ic a~cheological sites
which may be affected by the const~uction of majo~ d~ain­
age imp~ovements within the two counties.
Info~mation ~ega~ding sixty-th~ee a~cheological

sites was accumulated du~ing the su~veys and assessments;
ten of these sites We~~ p~eviously ~eco~ded while the
~emaining fifty-th~ee sites we~e located and ~eco~ded
as a ~esult of the p~esent p~oject. In addition to the
fo~mally ~eco~ded sites, fifteen isolated finds we~e
documented.
Nine of the sites a~e histo~ic in age while
fifty-fou~ sites and all of the isolated finds a~e p~e­
histo~ic in age.
Additional wo~k in the fo~m of subsu~face
testing to assess the potential NationaZ Registe~ of
Histo~ic Places eligibility is Wa~~anted at fifteen of the
sites; thi~teen of these a~e included within the Co~ps of
Enginee~s Pe~mit 113?4 alignment while the ~emaining two
a~e located on the alignment of the p~oposed No~th Ditch
which is being pu~sued by the D~ainage Dist~ict.
Ce~tain a~eas a~e identified as sensitive and a~e
~ecommended fo~ a~cheological monito~ing du~ing const~uc­
tion.
Some of these a~eas coincide with known a~cheo­
logical sites which a~e nea~, but not within, the p~oposed
d~ainage imp~ovement channel alignment while othe~s a~e

identified as sensitive on the basis of high potential
fo~ the occu~~ence of a~cheological sit~s as dete~mined
th~ough the application of a site location patte~n p~edic­
tive model developed du~ing the p~esent p~oject. Fou~teen
of the sites a~e not ~ecommended fo~ fu~the~ wo~k in conjunction with the p~esently planned d~ainage imp~ovements.
This is due to the fact that eithe~ (1) the sites lack
physical integ~ity and significant info~mation yield
potential, o~ (2) the p~oject is not expected to di~ectly
o~ indi~ectly affect the sites.

the~e

The a~cheological data accumulated suggest that
may be a dichotomy in the abo~iginal occupations:
xi

a maritime adaptation may be present a~ong the area of
the Laguna Madre on the eastern end of the project
universe whi~e a savannah adaptation may be present on
the Western end.
Within these adaptations, particu~ar~y
the maritime, there is a suggestion of a differentiation
of site types into temporary and semipermanent camps.
One human buria~ was exhumed from a site in the
Laguna Madre estuary system during the project. The
subadu~t individua~ wae buried in a tight~y f~exed postition.
A brief examination of the mortuary data from the Rio
Grande De~ta ~eads to the suggestion that the number of
interments in buria~ sites (sing~e events as opposed to
mu~tip~e-event true cemeteries) may support the temporary
and semipermanent campsite hypothesis. The buria~ a~so
provided the first radiocarbon date for the region; a
samp~e of the human bone yie~ded an assay of 540.t 110
radiocarbon years Before Present.
In the absence of other
estab~ished chorono~ogica~ indicators, this assay aids
aonsiderab~y in estab~ishing precise ahrono~ogica~
aontro~s for this region.
A~though projeati~e points
were found on severa~ of the sites, they have not been
demonstrated to be sensitive tempora~ indicators in
this region.
The historic materia~s recovered are primari~y
post-1900 in age.
However, severa~ of the historic sites
recorded are known to be associated ~itha co~p~ex of
dispersed ranches which operated in the area during the
nineteenth century.
A most significant finding resu~ting
from this project is that the ~ocations·df these dispersed
ranches coincide with natura~ topographic features which
were a~so important to the se~ection of campsites by
prehistoric peop~es.

PREFACE
This report combines the results of archeological
investigations carried out under two separate contr~cts.
A majority of the work was done for the Galveston District.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the terms of Contract
No. DACW64-80-C-0047 and is relevant to the areas which
are to be affected by construction and improvements planned
under Corps of Engineers Permit 11374. The remainder of
the work was done for the local sponsors of the project.
Hidalgo County Drainage District No.1 and Willacy County
Drainage District No.1. and is concerned only with the
segment of the project referred to as the "North Ditch".
Rather than publish two separate reports which would
overlap substantially in content, the contracting agencies
agreed to allow the results of the work to be published
as a single volume.
The work accomplished during this project has
added significantly to the archeological knowledge of a
poorly understood region. Previous work in the area has
consisted largely of surface surveys of varying types and
intensity. and salvage excavations of prehistoric cemetery
sites. There is an acute lack of excavations of campsites
which hampers the effectiveness of the interpretations
made on the basis of surveys such as this one. The need
for intensive excavations is demonstrated by the limited
interpretations proffered in this report. However. it is
hoped that the identification of potentially significant
sites accomplished during this survey will lead to further
work which should eventually serve to alleviate some
of the deficiencies in our knowledge of the archeological
record of the Rio Grande Delta.
The field staff. the laboratory staff and the
special studies consultants have done an admirable job
in compiling a comprehensive report of the findings
made during the surveys and assessmentstn Hidalgo and
Willacy counties. Prewitt and Associates, Inc. are
pleased to include this volume in our Reports of Investigation series.

PART I
Cultural Resources Survey and Assessments Along
Flood Control and Major Drainage Improvements,
Hidalgo and Willacy Counties, Texas

INTRODUCTION
A cultural resources survey and assessment along a
flood control and major drainage improvements project in
Hidalgo and Willacy counties, Texas, was conducted py Prewitt
and Associates, Inc. under terms of a contract issued by
the Galveston District Office of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. Field work began in late August of 1980 and
extended into early October of 1980, and was specifically
directed toward the examination of areas to be affected by
construction activities carried out under the provisions
of Permit No. 11374 issued by the Galveston Engineer District.
The results of the survey and assessment described in this
report conform to the requirements specified by the Corps
of Engineers; the report also conforms to the provisions of
State of Texas Antiquities Permit No. 256 issued by the
Texas Antiquities Committee to the local sponsors of the
project, Hidalgo Count~ Drainage District No.;l and Willacy
County Drainage District No.1.
Willacy and Hidalgo counties are located in extreme
southern Texas. These two counties and adjacent Cameron
County encompass the agriculturally rich subtropical and
semiarid portions of the Rio Grande Delta which lie north
of the international boundary of the United States and
Mexico. The project area is confined to the northern portion of the delta in Hidalgo and Willacy counties.
A total of 6.5 weeks were spent conducting the field
investigations; the basic crew of four persons was augmented
by two additional persons during the final two weeks of work.
The crew was further augmented at various times by special
studies consultants. D. William Day served as Project Archeologist and was in charge of the day-to-day operations and
logistics. Jane Laurens-Day served as Assistant Archeologist
and shared the responsibilities for successfully completing
the project. The Principal Investigator was Elton R. Prewitt.
This report is intended to be complementary to a
previous predictive survey conducted within the same general
sampling universe report by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977).
There is a substantial overlap in the background data included
within the two studies. For this reason, brief summaries of
the previous thorough reviews are included in this report in
lieu of a complete repetition of the detailed information provided by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen. The terminology d~veloped
in the previous report is retained here to the extent possible
in order that the two reports be compatible in their presentation.

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project area extends along the northern portions of the Rio Grande Delta from the Laguna Madre in
east-central Willacy County westward to southwestern
Hidalgo County. Relict distributary channels provide
drainage from the Arroyo Colorado southward to the Rio
Grande; however, the delta region north of the Arroyo
Colorado lacks natural drainage (Willacy County merits
the dubious distinction of being the only county in Texas
which does not encompass part or all of a single creek
or other natural drainageway). The flat, seemingly
featureless, deltaic plain is subject to rapid spontaneous flooding which is frequently prolonged in duration.
To partially alleviate this situation in an agriculturally rich region, it has been proposed that a; series
of improvements be made tb both help control and channel
disperse the damaging surface floodwaters. The plan
to accomplish this massive task includes the improvement
of approximately 142 miles (228.5 kilometers) of existing
artificial channels, the excavation of approximately
53 miles (85 kilometers) of new earthen channels, and the
installation of seventeen pumping stations along the
Arroyo Colorado and North Floodway.
The present cultural resources survey and assessment is concern with the impact these planned improvements may have upon potentially significant prehistoric
and historic sites in the Rio Grande Delta region.
Figure 1 indicates the locations of the various improvements within the current project are~. Key points and intersections have been assigned letter designations by the
sponsors to facilitate intraproject identification. In
addition, the segments frequently have been assigned descriptive names to further aid in the identification of
the channels. These are briefly reviewed below.
The "Main Floodwater Channel" exte~ds from point
D eastward to point A at the outfall and is designed to
allow drainage from central Hidalgo County to the estuary
system of the Laguna Madre in east-central Willacy County.
The "North Main Drain," which is composed of segments G-F,
F-E and E-D, and the "South Main Drain," which is composed.
of segments F-D and the associated "Edinburg Stub," form a
large loop which is designed to move water from south-cenrral
Hidalgo County into the Main Floodwater Channel. The "East

Lateral," composed of segments H-I and I-J, and the
"Southwest Lateral," composed of segments K-L, L-M,
M-N, and N-O, are designed to intercept floodwater and
to channel it into the main drainage system. Additional improvements are to include construction of
lateral segment Q-R in Willacy County, the installation
of seventeen pumping stations along the existing North
Floodway and the Arroyo Colorado, and the channelization
of a short section of the Arroyo Colorado south of the
City of Mercedes in Hidalgo County.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The environmental.characteristics of the'Rio
Grande Deltaic plain are presented in the following
summary. The discussion is limited to the Texas side
of the Rio Grande, and, when possible, is further
restricted to the portions of Hidalgo and Willacy
counties which are wholly encompassed by the deltaic
plain. Observable environmental characteristcs include
those which represent a reconstruction of past environments as eVidenced by relict fluvial and deltaic systems.
Geology
The geologic setting of Hidalgo and Willacy
counties consists of a complicated mixture of past and
present fluvial-deltaic deposits. Figure 2 illustrates
the topographic relief and geologic formations in the
project universe on the deltaic plain. The general
progradation of the surface and the distribution of
the geologic formations are indicated as they are
encountered along the drainage channel pathway.
Geologic formations of the Pliocen~~ Pleistocene,
Holocene, and Recent epochs of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods are observable within Hidalgo and Willacy
counties. Figure 3 indicates the location of various
geologic formations in the two counties. A summary
description follows in which each of the formations
is discussed in order from the geologically oldest to
the youngest.

Pliocene Epoch

The Pliocene Epoch is represented by the Goliad
Formation which is exposed in a small portion of northwestern Wi11acy County and in central and southwestern
Hidalgo County. The Goliad is composed of clay, sand,
sandstone, caliche, limestone, and dark siliceous granules and pebbles in a caliche matrix (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1976). The maximum thickness is 180 meters (600
feet) and the surface is masked by a discontinuous cover
of Lasara Loess which is characterized by stabilized
dunes and eolian depressions. The soils are moderately
permeable loamy upland soils (Ma11ouf, Baskin and Killen
1977: 15).
Pleistocene Epoch.

The Pleistocene Epoch as characterized by Ma11ouf,
Baskin and Killen (1977: 4), includes fourteen or more
major continental glacial advances interspersed by warmer
periods. The epoch ends at about 18,000 years B.P.
(Before Present, calculated from A.D. 1950); both an
early and a late episode of the formation are observable
in Hidalgo and Wi11acy counties. The early Pleistocene
is represented by the Lissie Formation. Beginning in
southwestern Hidalgo County, this formation trends east
and north along a narrow corridor to the northwestern
corner of Wi11acy County. The primary components are
clay, silt, gravel and caliche with a combined maximum
thickness of 120 meters (400 feet). Surface features on
the Lissie include water-bearing depressions, relict clay
dunes, and stabilized longitudinal dunes (Ma11ouf, Baskin
and Killen 1977: 14; Bureau of Economic Geology 1976).
The late Pleistocene is represented by the
Beaumont Formation which is exposed in southern Hidalgo
County and over much of Wi11acy County. Components of
the formation include clay, silt, sand, and gravel with
a maximum thickness of 275 meters (900 feet). Ma11ouf,
Baskin and Killen (1977: 13) describe the topography
as flat to gently undulating and characterize the formation as consisting of mud, sand and silt floodplain
deposits and eolian sands which are incised by relict
interdistributary channels, interf1uve and overbank
ponds, and channel crevasse splays.

HoZocene/Recent Epochs

The Holocene Epoch is believed to have begun
around 18,000 B.P. with the recession of the last major
ice sheet and continued to approximately 4,500 B.P. The
Recent Epoch follows from 4,500 B.P. to the present
(Brown et aZ 1980: 14). Four components resulted from
alluvial, eolian and marine processes which were active
during these epochs. These components, which are set
forth below, overl ie the earl ier Pleistocene and Pl iocene
deposits.
Sand Sheet: The sand sheet overlies the Pleistocene alluvial deposits in northern Hidalgo and Willacy
counties. Included within this Holocene deposit "are the
Norias eolian sand lobe, the El Jardin deflated areas and
the Rudolph sand loess plain (Mallouf, Baskin and Killen
1977: 6).
Stabilized Dune Deposits: The stabilized dune
deposits begin in western Cameron County and southeastern
Hidalgo County and are interspersed to the northwest
across Hidalgo County. These deposits of probable
Holocene age include the Edinburg and Faysville stabilized
dune fields. These eolian deposits overlie the earlier
Goliad, Lissie and Beaumont formations (Mallouf, Baskin
and Killen 1977: 9).
Mud, Silt, and Sand Floodplain Deposits: The mud,
silt and sand floodplain deposits are of Holocene and
Recent origin; they occur along the Rio Grande and appear
in southern Hidalgo County (Fig. 3) and cover much of
Cameron County (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976). Mallouf,
Baskin and Killen, citing Brown (1980), state:
Sediments of this complex fluVial
system are derived from creva~~e
splays, meander belt sands, abandoned
mud-filled channels, overbank floodbasin muds, distributary sands and
silts, interdistributary muds, and both
active and inactive clay-sand dunes (1977:
Sand, Silt, and Clay Barrier-Island/Tidal-Flat
Deposits: This component is located along the easternmost portion of Willacy County and is composed of sand,

INTRODUCTION

silt and clay sediments. These sediments have been reworked
by marine and eolian processes and are expressed as clay
dunes, mari ne pl ai ns, wi nd/tidal fl ats of the Laguna Madre
estuary system, and the sand dunes and beach of the Padre
Island barrier island complex (Mallouf, Baskin and Killen
1977: 11-12).
Cl imate
Subtropical and semiarid climatic conditions generally
prevail over the Rio Grande deltaic plain. Moist Gulf
breezes flow over the region from the southeast approximately
40 percent of the time. From November through February
intermittent temperature drops are brought on by north winds
associated with polar air masses.
The mean annuai temperature is 24° C (74° F) with
a record high of 42° C (107° F) and a record low of -11° C
(12° F). The average annual rainfall is 61.65 centimeters
(24.27 inches) with the peak periods occurring during early
fall and late spring. Forty-one hurricanes which have
affected the deltaic plain have been documented from 1818
to 1980 (U.S. Army Engineer District, Galveston 1979: 11-12).
August and September are usually the months of peak occurrence
of thunderstorms; an average of 24 days of thunderstorms
occur annually (Mallouf, Baskin and Killen 1977: 16).
Flora and Fauna
Hidalgo and Willacy counties are included within the
Tamaulipan biotic province (Blair 1950). The diverse flora
and fauna species in far southern Texas and northern Mexico
include some species endemic to that area. Past historic
accounts from the region suggest vast open plains which
have been subjected to an increase in brush density from
1840-1900 (Inglis 1964). Generally, clayey soi'ls are
believed to be capable of maintaining many varieties of
plant types while sandy soils tend to s~~port mesquite trees
and various grasses. The wide variety of mammals, reptiles
and avifauna appear to be more common on the marine plain/
clay dune complex of the Laguna Madre estuary and around
the many freshwater-bearing depressions scattered throughout
the region (especially those surrounded by dense brush).
Additional data on the region's biota is provided in Part
III of this report.

Land Use
The major modes of land use in Hidalgo and Willacy
counties have been divided into four categories. Table 1
adapted from the Environmental Impact Statement (U.S. Army
C~rps of EngineerDistric~, Galveston 1979: Table 53) provldes useful data concernlng land use. The four categories
of land use are:
.
Urban or Built-up Land: Land that has become part
of a village, town or city; residential, commercial
and services; industrial; transportation; communications and utilities; and other (Fig. 4a).
Agricultural Land: Cropland; rangeland (Fig. 5).
Unproductive Land; Wetland; barren land·' (land
inadequate for agricultural use and not developed
in any way).
Water: Number of acres of surface water such as
lakes, reservoirs, etc. (Fig. 4b) ..

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

The preceding table clearly indicates the major
impact of land use in Hidalgo and Willacy counties as of
1976. Agriculture was, and is, the sin91e largest
category of land use (Hidalgo County, 89 percent of total
land; Willacy County, 85.3 percent of total land). The
large amount of agricultural land is subcategorized by
whether it is cropland or rangeland. The table reveals
that in Hidalgo County 66 percent of the total land is
subject to cultivation, irrigation, and land-leveling
techniques and that 40.5 percent of Willacy County is
subjected to similar activities.
The second largest land-altering activity consists of urban growth and built-up land. A total of 6.8
percent of the acreage in Hidalgo County and 1.4 percent
of the acreage in Wi 11 acy, County was i ncl uded in' areas
affected by these activities as of 1976.
Only a limited number of unproductive acres and
surface-water areas remain unaltered by cultivation,
cleared rangeland, or urban growth and development.
Cropland and urban development appear to be the two major
factors responsible for destroyed and damaged cultural
resources. Rangeland, usually because of clearing for
improved pasture, is to a lesser extent harmful to both
prehistoric and historic sites. Essentially, this leaves
only unproductive lands, or 1.4 percent of Hidalgo
County and 7 percent of Willacy County, unaltered by
recent human activities as of 1976.
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The regional archeology in "far southern Texas"
(M all 0 uf, Bas kin and Kill en 1977: 5 7) and :ram a u1i Pas ,
Mexico has been the subject of contribution~ by more
than twenty-five researchers. However, only Mallouf,
Baskin and Killen's 1977 report, "A Predictive Assessment
of Cultural Resources in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties,
Texas" specifically addresses the current project area.
Their report provides an excellent summary of the archeological work which has been conducted previously in
the region. Rather than repeat the exhaustive review
of the regional literature presented by Mallouf, Baskin
and Killen, salient features of the previous works are
discussed here in terms of their applicability to the

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

current project universe. In view of the fact that
substantial amounts of the previous archeological work
have been carried out in neighboring Cameron County
(which is wholly encompassed by the Rio Grande delta),
the following discussions draw heavily upon the findings reported from that political subdivision.
The existing body of archeological data is
problematical; this is true primarily because of
past research orientations. First, major portions of
the data have not been thoroughly or comprehensively
tested. Much of the work has consisted of surface
reconnaissance and randomly collected surficially
exposed cultural materials. Named cultural complexes
are based on evidence which is controversial in ~ost
cases. The limited subsur~ace testing accomplished has
been concentrated in or near Falcon Reservoir, in South
and Central Tamaulipas, and on salvage-oriented work
at both aboriginal and historic cemetery sites in
Cameron and Hidalgo counties.
Second, much of the data has been reported from
a series of broad and diverse ecological zones which are
variously termed South Texas, South Central Texas,
Coastal Texas, South Texas Monte, Rio Grande Plain, or
the Rio Grande Delta. No clear-cut definition of the
cultural diversity within the differing ecological zones
can be determined from many of the reports. These broad
descriptive terms do not allow for an explanation of
the cultural diversity within the recognizable ecological
zones.
Third, there is little agreement among archeologists regarding appropriate taxonomic systems whi~h
should be used in discussing the cultural resources
within the Rio Grande Delta region. The lac~ of
excavation-derived data contributes substantially to
the uncertainty surrounding this aspect of the culture
history of the region. For the present purposes, a
generalized historical-developmental framework seems
most suitable for setting the local cultural expressions
into perspective. Four developmental stages are
recognized on the basis of the previous investigations.
These include: (1) Paleo-Indian, (2) Archaic, (3) Neo(3) Neo-Archaic (Late Prehistoric), and (4) Historic.

14

•

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

It must be emphasized that precise chronological controls are
lacking; consequently, the specific time periods during
which these stages existed are not known.
The cultural resources in far southern Texas and
northeastern Mexico are most frequently represented by
Archaic, Neo-Archaic and Historic materials, although
sparse materials representing Paleo-Indian occupations are
known. Two formal cultural units have been proposed
for the Rio Grande Delta region; these are the Brownsville
and Barril complexes which were described by MacNeish
(1947, 1958) on the basis of the extensive collections made
by A. E. Anderson of Brownsville. These two complexes are
similar in content and presumed temporal occurrence. They
are separated on the basis of an increase in the frequency
of marine shell projectile points in the Bard1 Complex
and an increase in the frequency of stone tubes in the
Brownsville Complex (MacNeish 1958: 186-192; Jackson 1940:
121). Both of these complexes are generally presumed to
be expressions of the Neo-Archaic Stage and to be late
prehistoric in age. It has also been suggested that the
peoples of the Rockport Focus, whi ch is ostensi b1y centered
in the Coastal Bend region near Corpus Christi, may have
exploited the coastal margin as far south as Wi11acy County
during the same time the Brownsville Complex peoples
inhabited the area (Ma11ouf, Baskin and Killen 1977: 88).
Just to the west of the current project universe,
investigations in the Falcon Reservoir area have led some
researchers to propose the Falcon and Mier foci (Suhm,
Kri eger and Jelks 1954: 136-142). The Fa1 con Focus presumably represents the Archaic Stage while the ill-defined
Mier Focus represents a continuation of the same general
adaptation into the Neo-Archaic Stage. There exists considerable controversy concerning the nature and reliability
of these cultural units. Some archeologists have suggested
that the Falcon and Mier foci represent]ong periods of
stable occupation which reflect little or no significant
cultural change through time (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954:
138). Other archeologists, arguing on the basis of more
recent investigations in the area, suggest that there is
substantial diversity within small geographical areas which
mayor may not relate compatibly within the larger regional
concept of "no major changes" (Nunley 1971: iv-v; Nun1~y
and Hester 1975: 95; Mallouf, Baskin and Killen 1977: 87).

15

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

At this stage of our understanding of the cultures of the Rio Grande Delta region, it is probably
best that the concept of defining formal cultural units
should be laid aside in favor of a more loosely structured
and more pragmatic approach to the study of the region.
This does not mean that the previous work (and proposed
units) should be ignored; rather, the generalized
cultural-historical framework of successive cultural
stages (Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Neo-Archaic and Historic)
should be employed for basic controls even though dates
cannot be applied to the stages. This will allow greater
freedom to define modes of adaptation through the examination
of the geographic patterning of site locations, with the
result that adaptive strategies may provide the indications of temporal changes which are now lacking. ;
Certainly there is a substantial basis in the
existing literature to support this approach. The
orientation of the present study is influenced by the past
recognition of site location patterns, which originated
in some of the earliest published regional literature.
Observations regarding the location of prehistoric sites
in relation to geologic and geomorphic features were
made as early as 1932 when Anderson wrote:
Evidence of former human occupation
are found inland during the digging
of canals, drainage ditches, etc ... ,
bordering the old overflow channels
of the river and in the land surrounding the small freshwater lakes ....
The area where archeological
material is most often found lies
on the coastal prairie belt on clay
hills within a few miles of th~
sea shore (1932: 29).
.
Anderson recognized that the aboriginal sites
were located on or near the levees of relict distributary
channel scars, around the edges of freshwater depressions,
and on the elevated clay dunes along the coast. He further
identifies the potential for encountering buried sites
during construction activities.

16

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

Later researchers, such as MacNeish (1947, 1958),
Hester (1969, 1976) Hester and Rodgers (1971), Nunley and
Hester (1975) and others, presented distinguishing
geologic and physical parameters which defind potential
site locations in "Southern Texas." However, in each instance
they draw attention to permanent recognizable stream courses.
Except for a short section of proposed channel in Environmental Zone IX (described in this report, there are no existing
active stream courses within the project universe.
Although working in an area slightly different from
the present project area, Prewitt (1974) has provided
definitions of five site location situations in Cameron
County between the Arroyo Colorado and the Ri9 Grande.
These locations include: (1) Clay Dune-Laguna~ (2) ResacaLaguna, (3) Clay Dune-Lake, (4) Resaca, and (5) Barrier
Island. The locational data used by Prewitt were based
upon a re-examination of Anderson's work as well as upon
additional recorded sites. It is significant to note that
pre-twentieth century Historic Stage sites are included in
the patterning identified during that study.
Mallouf, Baskin and Killen's. (1977) work draws
attention to the importance of both the physical characteristics and the location of aboriginal sites. They single
out the importance of La Sal Vieja, the Norias sand lobe
and eolian depressions. They indicate the potential these
features exhibit, such as potable water, game and vegetable
food resources, and use in hunting strategies, which would
make them attractive to aboriginal man.
Recently pUblished works which are helpful in
understanding the broader regional archeology are Kotter
(1980) and Highley and Hester (1980). They will be
valuable to future research by providing artifact comparisons and site locational data which will:. continue the
development of a regional chronology and contribute to
a better understanding of aboriginal lifeways.
Historic site investigations have been concentrated on the mid-nineteenth century period and particularly directed toward Mexican War and Civil War
military sites. These include the salvage excavation
of a Mexican War cemetery at Resaca de la Palma (Collins,
Hester and Ellezy n.d.), surveys of the Mexican War site
of the Palo Alto Battlefield (Baxter and Killen 1976), and
salvage work on the Civil War site of Brazos Santiago
Depot on the north end of Brazos Santiago Island (Corbin
and Tunnell n.d.; Boggs n.d.).

INV ESTIGATION PROCEDURES
Prior to the beginning of the current field work,
three weeks were spent reviewing the archeological literature and developing the investigation procedures. Most
influential to this work are the "environmental zones"
described by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977: 102-109)
and the identification of an apparent environment-site
location relationship. The environmental zones provide
a means of dividing the project universe into smaller and
more manageable units of study which reflect the effects
of past and present processes upon the cultural resources.
The relationship between site location and geologic features
provide a means of predicting site densities in the
project universe. The following discussion is presented
in three parts; a restatement of the environmental zones,
a statement on predictive modeling for the project universe,
and a discussion of the survey methods and procedures.
ENV IRONMENTAL ZONES
The work accomplished by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen
(1977) resulted in the identification of seven environmental
zones. The zones are defined according to geographical,
topographical and hydrological characteristics. Additional
kinds of information such as botanical data were used when
appropriate. A synopsis of each of the seven environmental
zones as described by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977:
102-109) is provided below. Two new zones, Zones VIII and IX
are added to this list (Fig. 6). These two zones were not
included in the sampling universe of the previous study.
Environmental Zones I
Environmental Zone I is restricted to Hidalgo County
and consists of the northwest-trending Faysville and Edinburg stabilized dune field. The topography is highly
irregular and varies from relatively flat and gently
undulating to areas of stabilized dune which display
substantial relief. The elevations in the eastern section
of Zone I average about 14 meters (45 feet) above Mean Sea'
Level (MSL), while the elevations within the stabilized dunes
on the western edge may reach heights of up to 38 meters
(125 feet) above MSL.

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

There are no significant natural stream courses in
Zpne I. Except for occasional isolated scatters of pea
g'ravel, the area is free of natural rock and gravel outcrops. The Holocene fluvial, deltaic and eolian deposits
are strewn with Pleistocene meander-belt sands and muds.
The largest percentage of the land in Zone I is subject to
irrigated and dry-land cultivation while the remaining
lands are included in areas of urban development.
Environmental Zone II
Environmental Zone lIlies in the central and western portions of Wi11acy County and extends through much of
central and southwestern Hidalgo County. It is interrupted
by Environmental Zone I in Hidalgo County. Elevations
range from 9 meters (30 feet) above MSL in the east to 3338 meters (110-125 feet) above MSL in the west. The topography in the eastern portion, although marked by low hummocks, is relatively flat and is characterized by mud-filled
channel scars and depressions which have resulted from both
fluvial and eolian processes. In the eastern areas of Hidalgo County, the surface topography is more undulating in
the area covered by the Hargill Conical Dune Field (Price
1958: 52); farther west near Edinburg, the topography of
the zone resumes its generally flat character.
Natural stream courses and significant rock and
gravel outcrops are not found within the boundaries of Environmental Zone II. Flooding in the area has been reduced
by the construction of the Rio Grande lakes; however, a
tropical storm or a year of heavy rainfall can inundate
areas within the zone.
The largest percentage of the land is currently
used for agriculture, the majority of which involves cultivation and, to a lesser extent, rangeland. A small percentage is utilized for expanding urban dev~lopment in the
area.
Environmental Zone III
Environmental Zone III crosses the northern portion of Wi11acy County and extends slightly into eastern
Hidalgo County. The eastern edge is included within the
El Jardin deflation area and the western edge is included

within the Rudolph Sand/Loess sheet. Elevations range
from 5 meters (15-20 feet)above MSL in the east to an average of 14 meters (45-50 feet) above MSL in the west
with an occasional high of up to 29 meters (95 feet) above
MSL. Zone III is generally more flat than the Hargill
Conical Dune Field of Environmental Zone III; however,
near La Sal Vieja large clay-sand dunes have been created
by eolian processes. The western half of this zone displays an undulating Holocene surface which is marked by
innumerable eolian depressions.
Within the boundaries of Enviornmental Zone III,
no natural stream courses or rock or gravel outcrops exist.
Flooding is often intensive during a tropical storm or a
year of heavy rainfall.
The primary land use activity can be characterized as rangeland while a much smaller amount is used as
cultivated land. The plant biotypes with this zone range
from live oak and mesquite trees to prickly pear, foxtail,
needle grass and broomsedge.
Envi ronmental Zone IV

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

Modern agriculture has led to large scale landform
alterati on withi n Zone IV. The percentage of 1and i ncl uded
ir cultivation activities is increasing annually. The eastern margin of the zone is primarily used for rangeland, although an alarming amount of clearing to facilitate cultivation is occurring there. Only a minimal amount of land
is utilized for urban development, although recent growth
patterns in the area suggest that this pattern is changing.
Environmental Zone V
Environmental Zone V is located in the northeastern corner of Willacy County.
It is bounded on the east by
Envi ronmenta 1 Zone VI, on the south by Envi ronmenta 1 Zone
IV, on the west by Environmental Zone III, and to the north
it extends into Kenedy Co~nty. It is composed of a Holocene deposit of active and stabilized dunes overlying a
Pleistocene plain. Elevations range from 1.5 meters (5-10
feet) above MSL to 21 meters (70-75 feet) above MSL.
The active dune sheet is comprised of eolian sand
and contains many blow-out areas. Except for occasional
shrub thickets, the active dunes are without vegetation.
A low pl a in surrounds the act i ve sand sheet and is composed
of sand and silt which contain many marshy depressions.
Stabilized dunes are located northwest of the active sand
sheet and contain many meadowlike flats. Soils within the
stabilized dunes consist of eolian sands stained with humus.

•

The area of Zone V does not contain a natural
stream course, nor do rock and gravel outcrops occur.
Flooding occurs in this zone but is usually due to storm
surges associated with tropical storms. The majority of
the land is used for rangeland and supports live oak and
mesquite forests; the remaining land is barren and lies
in disuse.
Envi ronmenta 1 Zone VI
Environmental Zone VI is located along the eastern portions of Willacy County. It is composed of the
marine plain. wind/tidal flats, clay dunes. and barrier
island complexes (Fig. 8). The zone is a Holocene formation in which most of the lands are coastal wetlands
and the remaining lands are formed into eolian clay dunes.
The clay dunes rise about 7.5-10.5 meters (25-35 feet)
above the marine plain. Vegetation on the clay dunes
ranges from very dense brush to open grassy areas. The
wind/tidal flats are free of vegetation and contain yearround and/or seasonal salt water pools.

Flooding in Environmental Zone VI is frequently
and usually occurs as a result of tidal surges
during tropical storms. Land use is restricted to
rangeland. The plant biotypes are primarily salttolerant species although the more elevated areas support grasses and plants which are more appealing to
cattle.
s~vere

Environmental Zone VII
Environmental Zone VII is composed of small
pockets of modern alluvium along the northern side of
the Arroyo Colorado in Willacy County. The topography
is undulating and the sands and silts support a ground
cover which consists of s~rubs and grasses. EleYations
in the Zone range from 1.5 meters (5 feet) above MSL to
4.5 meters (15 feet) above MSL. Land use is nearly
equally divided between dry cropland and rangeland.
Land destruction within the zone has been accelerated
by the building of roads and by recent stream dredging
operations.
Environmental Zone VIII
Environmental Zone VIII is located in south central Hidalgo County. It coincides with the surface
expression of the late Pleistocene Beaumont Formation;
however, the areal distribution of this zone is interrupted by the northwest-trending dune fields described
as Environmental Zone I. Environmental Zone VIII is
comparable to Environmental Zone IV in that is contains
vast areas of floodplain deposits and poor drainage.
However, the elevations are higher than in Zone IV and
range from 27.5 meters (90 feet) to 32.5 meters (110
feet) above MSL, and there is a noticeable decrease in
the number of remnant mud-filled distributiry channel
scars and eolian depressions.
.
A large portion of this zone is being encroached
upon by ever-growing urban development which includes
Mission, McAllen, Pharr, San Juan and other cities.
The remainder of the land is used for citrus orchards and
cultivated crops.

Environmental Zone IX
•

•
Environmental Zone IX is narrow strip of land
which extends through southern Hidalgo County and into
Cameron County. It is primarily composed of recent alluvium forming a floodplain. Uvalde gravels, which contain
igneous rocks, cherts and quartzites, are commonly found
within this zone. Elevations range from 38 meters (125
feet) above MSL in the west to 23 meters (75 feet) above
MSL in the east. This zone encompasses portions of the
Arroyo Colorado and the Rio Grande. Flooding in this
zone has been reduced through the construction of upriver
dams on the Rio Grande and the North F100dway roughly
parallel to the Arroyo Colorado. However, heavy rains
and tropical storms still inundate the area frequently
due to poor surface drain~ge. Land use is predominantly
irrigated and dry-land agriculture. Only a few small
towns, such as Hidalgo and Progresso, exist with the
zone.

PREDICTIV E MODEL
In recent years predictive modeling has emerged
as a useful tool for formulating theory and for interpreting data relating to both historic and prehistoric archeology. MOdels enable archeologists to better understand the relationships between variables and to explain
observations, and those offering site location predictions constitute one of the most common applications of
this approach. However, such models must be designed
with the strictest possible definitions of variables and
sampling techniques, and they must allow for refinement
and revisions based on additional investigations and analysis. In cultural resources management, predictive
models frequently are used as an aid in the development
of hypotheses for future field investigations as well
as in the formulation of future constructia~ and development plans within a given project universe. Generally,
predictive modeling may be expected to extend beyond the
realm of temporal and cultural affiliations and to provide a framework for the reconstruction of the cultural
factors which are influential in the decision-making
process within a cultural unit.
The model used during this project has been developed through the integration of observations made by
past researchers with the results of an airphoto analysis
26

INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES

accomplished prior to the current field work. Briefly restated, previous researchers have observed that archeological sites are located on the margins of depressions, on
the levees of distributary channels, on clay dunes of the
Laguna Madre estuary, and on the stabilized dunes farther
inland. At the outset of the current project, high altitude stereoscopic color aerial photographs of the project
area generated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1972 were obtained. These airphotos, at a scale of approximately 1: 62 500, were stereoscopically analyzed to identify geologic features which
were then plotted on United States Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5' topographic sheets (See Airphoto Analysis,
this report). This analysis combined with the previously
reported site distribution data provided the; basis for
predicting areas of hlgh site occurrence probability
across the project universe.
The limitations of a hunting and gathering economy were then examined in terms of the geologic setting.
This comparison revealed influential economic and environmental features which may be responsible for aboriginal
decisions regarding site locations. The assumption that
a hunting and gathering economy best describes the general adaptation for the region is based on the conclusions presented by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen:
Hunti ng and gathering as a successfully
adapted and persistent way of life pervades all prehistoric data thus far assembled from the region (1977: 198).
A hunting and gathering economy requires the exploitations of a variety of food and other resources from a
variety of places; groups must anticipate the'whereabouts of attainable resources and must be adequately
mobile to procure them.
The natural resources which could have been exploited by aboriginal peoples living on the deltaic plain
are not thoroughly defined at this time. Only a few vegetable, aquatic, avifauna and mammalian species have been
recognized as economically desirable (see Faunal Analysis,
Part III, this report). Additional research is required
to define the range of these natural resources within the
project universe.

27

•

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

The requirements of a hunting and gathering economy
are interwoven with the geomorphic, climatic and other
physical characteristics of the Rio Grande Deltaic Plain .
The generally low elevation, proximity to the Gulf, and
poorly drained alluvial soils allow for severe and prolonged flooding brought on by heavy rains and/or tropical
storms. Alternately, there are periods of long hot dry
spells when there is little to no rainfall which may continue for months at a time. These circumstances are expected to have caused the aboriginal peoples to seek higher
ground in times of flooding, and areas with potable water
during the more arid times. In addition, these characteristics are expected to have influenced the availability of
exploitable biota within the region and may have made it
necessary for campsites to be relocated in order;to obtain
the floral and faunal resources desired.
The geologic features within the project universe
which coincide with these requirements are eolian and
other topographic depressions, relict distributary channel
scars and associated natural levees, elevated clay dunes
at the estuary of the Laguna Madre, and stabilized dunes
further inland. A schematic indicating geological/topographical/environmental situations where sites might be
expected to be found is illustrated in Figure 9.
A settlement pattern of temporary and semipermanent camps is anticipated. Semipermanent camps are defined
as those camps that were occupied for a period of one to
two weeks and up to one season or more per year, but probably less than a full year. Seasonal occupations are not
required to be consecutive, nor were the campsites necessarily used year after year. These camps -may have contained perishable habitation structures, a variety of activity areas, and may have been occupied by a large portion of a given social unit's population. -A variety of
activities could have been carried out at these sites:
stone tool manufacturing, hide processing, bone and wood
working, hearth construction, food preparation, disposal
of the dead. A variety of tools and manufacturing debris
which reflect these activities may be recovered from these
sites. Further, semipermanent camps are assumed to be the
locations where social and religious activities occurred
on a regular basis. The abandonment and subsequent relocations of semipermanent camps is assumed to have been
relatively infrequent and dependent upon the availability
of resources, including those which were stored and those
which were sufficiently near to have been acquired on a
daily basis.

Clearly, human occupations were not limited to the
areas described above, but doubtless occurred in other
a~eas in the form of temporary camps.
These temporary
camps are assumed to have been established for the purpose
of exploiting specific resources and were occupied for
short periods of time. Probably this was from one day up
to one or two weeks. These camps are expected to have
been located near resources which could have been utilized
on the spot or which could have been transported to the
semipermanent camp for community use. It is expected that
the locations of temporary camps were flexible and that
they were situated so that both the higher elevations and
the lower areas near desired resources could be utilized.
Temporary and semJpermanent sites are expected to
contain different densities of artifacts. Materials recovered from temporary sites should consist of remains
relating to specific exploitive activities. At temporary
sites where hunting and the procurement of meat were the
main objectives, a high percentage of tools representative of slaying and butchering activities should be present. Because of the perishable nature of digging sticks,
baskets, nets, and other nondurable items, temporary
sites which focused on gathering are expected to yield few
artifacts. A family unit or small band could have accomplished both types of exploitive activities (hunting and
gathering) at the same temporary sites; in this case a
mixing of artifacts associated with the varied activities
could occur. However, the density of artifacts and the
possibility of site stratification should be more limited
than is expected in the semipermanent camps.
Determining whether a site represents a semipermanent or a temporary camp may be difficult. The physical
characteristics which prevail in the deter~ination of appropriate site locations are subject to con~tant and rapid
change on the deltaic plain. A location which may have
been used as a semipermanent camp at one point in time may,
at a later period have been acceptable only for the limited
exploitive activities associated with a temporary campsite.
It should also be noted that this predictive model·
is based largely on observations derived from surficially.
exposed materials. These materials may not be reliable
site indicators in all cases due to extensive cultural resource destruction and disturbance resulting from current
land-use practices. A specific example is land leveling

which may result in the complete displacement of the components of a site. The model appears to be relatively accurate in that it identifies high site potential areas.
Further there seems to be some correlation between the
observed surface characteristics and the occurrence of
buried sites (see Survey Results, Part I, this report).
This model does not incorporate such motivations as religious or superstitious ideologies and their effects on
past lifeways and settlement patterns.
Although this locational model was developed on
the basis of prehistoric site data, it was later found to
apply equally as well to pre-twentieth century historic
ranch sites. Certainly the historic ranchi.ng industry was
not dependent upon the same range of food ahd other natural resources which operated as limitations for the aboriginal adaptations. Yet, some of the variables do overlap.
These include the selection of rises for protection from
floodwaters and which are associated with adjacent surface depressions from which water ~ould be obtained in
times of low rainfall. To a degree, this pattern persists today in the form of numerous wells and stock ponds
in surface depressions and the occurrence of modern ranch
headquarters in the same location as their historic predecessors.
SURVEY METHODS
The purpose of the present investigation was to
locate, record and assess the historic and prehistoric
cultural resources within or adjacent to the project area
and to assess potential impacts on these resources. The
scope of work for this investigation was based upon the
observations and recommendations of Mallouf, Baskin and
Killen (1977). Their recommendations: for extensive survey
were based on the examination of the a~ea in terms of predicted site density and integrity by environmental zone,
recognizing the varying environmental and depositional
characteristics which identify the zones in both modern
and prehistoric times, and taking into account modern
land use practices.
As a result, the intensity of field survey varied
along the different segments of the project alignment depending on the environmental zones in which the segments
were located. The requirements contained in the scope of
work are briefly reviewed in the following summary:
31

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

(1) assessment of project impact upon all previously recorded sites within or adjacent to the project alignment;
(2) limited field investigation of channel segments
C-D, D-F, F-G, E-F, K-L and H-J with survey restricted to
investigation of site leads and high potential areas in Environmental Zones I and II;
(3) field investigation of channel segments B-C,
D-E, H-I, Q-R and the Edinburg Stub, pump stations nos. 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 and channel improvements between pump
stations nos. 12 and 13 on the Arroyo Colorado which wer.e
restricted to investigation of site leads and areas of high
potential in Environmental Zones, I, II, IV:
(4) intensive field investigation of channel segment A-B in Environmental Zone IV and the tidal/flat clay
dune complex in Environmental Zone VI adjacent to the outfall; and
(5) intensive investigation of 25 per cent of channel segment L-O in Environmental Zones I a_nd II, randomly
selected.
A summary of the intensity of survey conducted
along each segment of channel is contai~ed in Table 2. Also
included are the approximate lengths of the segments and an
indication of whether each is an existing or a new segment.
The specific areas examined are delineated in Figure 10.
With the exception of channel segment A-B, the adjacent outfall areas in the Laguna Madre estuary, and the pump station locations, all of the areas surveyed were selected on
the basis of either (1) the presence of previously recorded
sites, or (2) the predicted potential for the presence of a
site as determined from the airphoto analysis or from the
concurrent historical research. Prior to -initiating the
field work, the locations of the channel alignments and the
extent of the project area were transferred to sets of USGS
7.5' topographic maps. Known archeological sites were also
plotted, and the areas of high site potential as identified
from the results of the airphoto analysis were indicated on
the maps.
The pedestrian survey was conducted by using the
diamond-pattern method, which was found to be effective by
Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (197-7: 99-100), wherever possible. The use of this method insured thorough surface examination in areas which were cleared of vegetation or which
contained low densities of brush. Wooded areas and citrus

orchards required the use of more arbitrary methods of
coverage such as "dog legs". The impenetrable nature of
sugar cane fields precluded survey of those areas.
Less desirable arbitrary methods were also used in
the examination of the Laguna Madre estuary. Heavy brush
and other ground cover on the clay dunes hampered visibility except on the eroded faces adjacent to the wind/tidal
flats. Where possible, areas on the tops and backsides of
the clay dunes were surveyed; however, coverage was primarily limited to arbitrary transects along the exposed faces
of the dunes. Similar problems were encountered on the edges of the marine plain. Dense vegetation, primarily sacahuiste grass, masked the surface of the marine plain, limited coverage to the eroded margins and the exposed faces
adjacent to the wind/tidal flats.
All previously unrecorded archeological sites encountered during the survey were assigned temporary field
numbers. These numbers were assigned consecutively within
each county with those in Hidalgo County given a prefix of
"H" and those in Wi 11 acy County gi ven a prefi x of "W".
Following completion of the field work, copies of the completed site survey forms were furnished to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of the University of Texas at
Austin and that agency assigned permanent trinomial site
designations. In this system, the number 41 identifies
the state as listed in the alphabetical order of the
states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), the letters HG are
the standard abbreviation for Hidalgo County (WY for Willacy County), and 28 indicates the sequential order in
which the site is reported within a county. The site number 41HG28, then, is the designator for the twenty-eighth
site recorded in Hidalgo County, Texas.
For purposes of this survey, a prehistoric archeological site is defined as any locality in "which a human
burial or any other nonportable feature is~ound, or a locality where three or more artifacts are found within an
area of approximately 100 meters diameter. Artifacts consist of tools or debris which may normally be associated
with prehistoric people. These include stone tools, tool
fragments or debris; faunal remains including bones,
freshwater mussel shell sand mari ne shell s (either modified or nonmodified); and burned clay lumps. Any combina-"
tion of three of these items are interpreted as sites
with the exception of burned clay lumps. Unless observed
as recognizable hearth eroding from an obvious prehistoric
soil horizon, burned clay lumps were not considered indicative of a site in the absence of stone, bone or shell associations.

Several instances occurred where items were found
but not in sufficient quantities to meet the minimum requirements for designation as a site. These were recorded
as isolated finds and otherwise treated as sites in terms
of descriptions and types of notes taken. The designators
differ from the site numbers in that the prefix "IF" (for
isolated find) is substituted for the state designator 41;
the project identifier "HW" is substitued for the county
abbreviations. The isolated finds are then numbered sequentially in a series separate from the sites, and this
number is followed by the county abbreviation in parentheses.
The designator IFHW3(HG) indicates the third isolated find
made during the Hidalgo-Willacy project and that it is
located in Hidalgo County. This system of numbering the
isolated finds was coordinated through the Texas 'Archeological Research Laboratory.
Subsurface tests were made in a limited number of
instances to assist in completing the assessments of sites.
These excavations were designed to aid in the following
objectives:
( 1 ) determine the presence of buried cul tura 1
materials;
( 2) determine

the relative density of cultural

materials;
( 3 ) determine the integrity of buried materials;
and
( 4 ) determine the configuration of specific
features.
Subsurface tests were found to be time-consuming in
that controlled excavations are difficult tq accomplish in
the compact soils of the area. As a result;' excavations
were made only at three sites; these are 41HG96, 41WY50
and 41WY60. A further complication arose from the number
of sites found. Based on the findings of the predictive
survey by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977), it was expected
that site densities would be relatively low. However,
a greater number of sites than were anticipated were
found, resulting in more time spent completing basic recording of sites and less time conducting the subsurface
tests. Another limiting factor involved contacting the
landowners or their agents to obtain permission to exca36

INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES

vate. Frequently, landowners were hesitant to allow excavation, even those of a limited nature. This was particularly problematical in the citrus orchard region on the
west end of the project.
The tests which were excavated were oriented to
the cardinal directions and were either lxI-meter square
or Ix2-meter rectangular units. Most of these were handexcavated in 20-centimeter arbitrary levels; however, in
most cases, cul tura 1 materi a 1s were rel atabl e to di screte
stratigraphic units which were visible following completion of the excavations. Vertical controls were maintained by establishing a temporary datum at the highest
corner of each unit. Measurements were taken with the aid
of a string line, line level and hand tape. Excavated matrix was sieved through i-inch mesh hardware~cloth and all
materials recovered were placed in paper bags which were
labeled with the site number, site area, unit number, level , date and excavators I names. Measured drawi ngs of profiles and floor plans showing natural strata, features and
disturbances were made. Following completion of all recording and photography, the excavations were back-filled.
Sketch maps of the three tested sites Were made with the
aid of a builders transit, stadia rod and 50-meter tape.
Relevant surface features, arbitrary elevation contours,
and the locations of excavations were indicated on the
sketch maps.
An exception to the standard subsurface tests was
made at site 41HG96. At that site, a backhoe was used to
excavate a short trench to provide better visibility of
the natural stratigraphy in one area of the site. The
backhoe was graciously furnished and operated by the owner
of portions of the site.
One final note regarding the field survey methods
is appropriate. In order to test the validity of our predictions of high site potential localit~es, several low
potential areas were examined. These areas were selected
on the basis of access and proximity to high site potential
localities that had to be surveyed. Although in a sense
this coverage was incidental, low potential areas were indeed examined intensively during the process of walking between the high potential areas.
Under the terms of the contract for this project,
a 11 notes, drawi ngs, maps, photographs, other documents,
artifacts and materials recovered are to be furnished to
the Galveston District Office of the Corps of Engineers
for final disposition.

predicted high site potential areas. These sites were
found on the leeward side of low marine plains between
clay dunes and wind/tidal flats. Three sites, 41WY51,
41WY52 and 41WY53 are included in this locationa1 category.
The relationships of sites to channel scar levees,
margins of depressions, and clay dunes were found to extend to pre-twentieth century historic ranch sites. All
of the observed historic ranch sites are located in one of
those three locationa1 categories.
It is significant that along channel segment A-B
there were no sites found on unmodified ground surfaces.
All the sites in that section were discovered on. the
spoil banks of the existing channel. The implication is
that this area is in a depositional environment wherein
there may be numerous unexposed prehistoric sites. Ten
sites were found along channel segment A-B which are estimated to be buried at depths of from 0.5 meter to 1.5
meters. These sites include 41WY61 through 41WY70.
Generally, the prehistoric materials recovered
consist of stone tools, lithic debitage, marine shells,
bone fragments, and burned clay lumps. One thousand and
seventy-five artifacts were collected during the survey
and from the excavation of subsurface probes. Seventeen
projectile points comprise the most diagnostic group of
artifacts, with lithic debris being the largest category
of undiagnostic cultural materials collected; included
are 875 cores, flakes and chips.
In addition, two inhumations were recovered during the field investigations. The first was located at
41WY50 and was found eroding out of the base of a clay
dune. The individual appears to be a subadu1t male approximately 15 to 15 years of age with an estimated stature of 5 feet 4 inches (163 centimeters) to 5 feet 5
inches (166 centimeters). The outline of a possible
burial pit was recorded on the basis of the compactness
of the soil. This presumed burial pit is subcircu1ar and
is approximately 75 centimeters long north/south and 70
cent i mete r s wi de e a s t /we s t. The sku 11, rib s, ve r t e brae,
innominates, scapulae and humeri all suggest that the individual was lying on his right side in a tightly flexed
position. However, close inspection reveals that the
legs, although tightly fe1exed, do not have a corresponding positioning with the upper body. The patellas were

SURVEY RESULTS

in the proximity of the innominates and the heads of the
femurs lay immediately in front of the face.
Two possible explanations for the contrast of the body
position have been suggested. First, it may be that the legs
were amputated prior to burial or second that the body was
laid on its back and right side and had the legs drawn up
tightly over the left side with a resulting shift during decomposition of the body. Neither of the above-mentioned
possibilities adequately explain the observed position of the
inhumation.
Notable characteristics of the inhumation are extensive dental wear, shovel-shaped incisors, cranial deformation, peridontal disease, and a general osteoporotic infection.
Grave goods recovered and associated with the burial include
a long thinned bone found at the back of the skull which is
interpreted to be a hairpin. This artifact is quite similar to
another specimen described by Mallouf and Zavaleta (1979:
21). Also included in the burial were two coyote canine teeth
and a number of small unidentifiable canid tooth fragments.
These were found near the midsection of the inhumation at the
front of the body between the legs and the chest. Also
found was one small bit of modified bone which exhibited
rounding and smoothing (see Part III, Site Descriptions,
Appendix IV, and Artifact Analysis, Appendix V).
The second inhumation was found at 41WY67 on the
spoil bank of the existing drainage channel segment A-B.
Twelve human bone fragments were recovered. The most diagnostic assemblage of the recoverd bone consists of approximately one-half of the mandible.
It is apparent that the
tooth loss was extensive. The left molars and the second left
premolar are missing and closure of the sockets has occurred
to large extent. Also recovered were three fragments of
the parietals, fragments of the clavicle; radius, and third
metacarpal. Interestingly, two long bon~~ were recovered
which fit together. These two bones may represent either
the midsection of a femur or a humerus. The section indicates an extreme amount of lateral compression which is
possibly nutritional- or deficiency-related. Materials
associated with this site were chert debitage, two gouge~,
one scraper, miscellaneous faunal remains, and burned clay
lumps. All materials were disturbed and taken out of context
by excavation of the channel segment (see Part III, Site
Descriptions, Appendix IV, Artifact Analysis, Appendix VI,
and Analysis of Human Skeletal Material Appendix VI.)
41

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

Recovered diagnostic historic materials consist of
ceramic sherds, glass fragments, and metal scraps. The
largest group of collected historic materials is the
ceramic sherds. Represented among the collection are earthenware, stoneware, porcelain and Mexican ware. Two historic
sites (41HG82 and 41WY81) were located during the surface
reconnaissance. Six historic sites 41WT46, 41WY49, 41WY54,
41WY55. 41WY56, and 41WY58) were recorded as a result of the
archival research conducted by the project historian. No
artifacts were collected from these six sites, and none of
them lie within the easements of the drainage channel.
In
addition, ten of the forty-one prehistoric sites contained
historic materials. These sites are 41HG81, 41HG83, 41HG87,
41HG89, 41HG91, 41HG94, 41HG96, 41HG98, 41WY75, 41WY77. The
historic artifacts collected suggested a possibl~ chronological frame from the early 1900's to the present and in
most cases probably from the 1930's to the 1960's.
The following nine archeological sites were previously recorded by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977) and
were resurveyed during the current field investigations:
41HG38 through 41HG42 and 41WY5 through 41WY8. All of
the Hidalgo County sites which were revisited were confirmed, although in many cases only a limited amount of
material was found with the exception of 41HG41. This
site was under water from Hurricane Allen and resurvey
during the flood season was impossible. In Willacy County,
sites 41WY7 and 41WY8 were confirmed; however, 41WY5 and
41WY6 could not be positively identified.
In addition to the sites previously mentioned,
two other sites, 41WY73 and 41WY73, were identified
(Fig. 11). They are shown because they are directly
affected by both the existing drainage channel segment
A-B and the proposed North Ditch. Their presence was
recorded during the local project, and disc~ssions
regarding them can be found in Part II of this report.
A similar circumstance exists for 41WY61 and 41WY62;
however, these two sites were recorded during the federal
project and are reported in this section of the report.

CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS

11374 has yielded significant data concerning the cultural resources which exist within the Rio Grande Delta. These data
enhance the previously reported information and provide a substantial basis for evaluating previous interpretations and
suggesting avenues of investigation which may be appropriate
to increasing knowledge of the prehistoric and early historic
inhabitants of the region.
The present data supports the conclusions of Mallouf,
Baskin and Killen (1977: 198) that prehistoric adaptations may
be overwhelmingly characterized as hunting and gathering.
Further, their suggestions regarding the importance of temporary water sources and associated wildlife and vegetable
resources are strongly supported. This aspect of the environmental setting is seen as a dominant factor i~ terms of decisions regarding prehistoric site location. Water was scarce
and of undependable supply, and the prehistoric inhabitants
must certainly have selected camping locations which would
provide the most assured water supply in combination with food
sources and protection from sporadic flooding.
A locational model has been developed as a result of
this consideration of water features as deterministic influences
on prehistoric site selection. An airphoto analysis of the
project area provided detail and surface characteristics from
which to predict areas of high site occurrence potential.
The water-related features which are identifiable and which are
strongly associated with prehistoric site locations include
eolian depressions in the sand dune field, relict distributary
channel scars with eolian depressions on the deltaic plain, the
levees adjacent to the channel scars, and clay dunes in the
Laguna Madre estuary system.
While this model suggests the placement of sites as
a cultural response to geological features, it does not explain the cultural mechanisms and characteristics by which
the aboriginal peoples were able to succ~~sfully adapt to
the harsh environment of the Rio Grande Delta. It is assumed
that both floral and faunal communities were similarly dependent upon and associated with the unreliable seasonal water
sources. This covariance of natural resources is seen both
as the main attraction to human populations and as the key to
man's successful adaptation. A variety of vegetal, aquatic,
avifaunal, and mammalian species present in the region today
are recognized as probable desirable economic resources

43

•

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

utilized by the aboriginal peoples. The remains of a few
animals which are no longer present in the region (such as
bison) were noted on some sites, and it is assumed that
these animals represent additional resources available to
the former inhabitants.
It is presumed that a hunting and gathering society would have been organized into small groups similar to
those further north on the Rio Grande Plain described by
Cambell and Campbell (1981). The settlement system is expected to have been organized to allow for rapid responses
to the constantly varying locations of the resources necessary for survival, and the system is expected to have included at least two types of camps: semipermanent and
temporary.
Primary social interaction, daily maintenance
activities, recreation, religion and other facets of
cultural behavior are expected to have occurred within
or near the semipermanent camps. These camps were probably abandoned infrequently and only in response to the
depletion of one or more of the essential resources (water,
food, firewood) in the practical gathering range of the
camp. The temporary camps probably were more restricted
in that they were used for specific purposes. Examples
might include the gathering of particular vegetable foods
during the peak of seed- or fruit-bearing seasons, the
trapping of small game or collection of waterfowl, or
the hunting of game such as deer. The durable cultural
materials present on a given site should reflect this
variation of use.
Admittedly, there are problems in distinguishing
between these two types of sites, and extensive investigations may be necessary before this dichotomy can be
pursued with any degree of confidence. The very nature
of the sites in the Rio Grande Delta is such that evidence
of human use is thinly distributed, difficult to recognize, and as shown in three major surveys (Prewitt 1974;
Mallouf, Baskin and Killen 1977; and the present survey),
liberally distributed over the landscape. Certainly, the
surface data which has been collected is insufficient to
provide any distinctions between the two types of sites
althou9h in some cases such as at 41WY67 there is just
enough of a hint in the quantities and varieties of artifacts present to suggest that further investigations may indeed provide that data with which to thoroughly examine
44

•

CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS

this aspect of the prehistoric settlement system.
The problems associated with examining the settlement
system are further compounded by the lack of temporal controls
as noted by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977: 198). While
semipermanent and temporary camps may be distinguishable
through controlled excavations, there remains the significant
question of age. The artifacts and debris which characterize
this region are particularly unsuitable for the development
of temporally distinct stylistic trends. There is some indication of age variation in the degree of mineralization and
weathering of faunal remains which were recovered during
the present survey. However, these indications are gross and
are of little value in developing precise chronologies. These
characteristics are unreliable in the absence 'of detailed studies
of the rates of minerallzation and weathering of bones in the
region. Perhaps the most reliable temporal indicators at
the present time are the remains of extinct fauna which were
collected from a few sites. Again, though, these indicators
are gross in terms of chronology and it has not been demonstrated
whether those remains are associated with the cultural materials
with which they were collected.
It is tantaliZing to speculate
that there may be human remains associated with extinct fauna;
however, this is not substantiated by the present data.
Perhaps the most crucial key to establishing any resemblance of a reliable chronology in the Rio Grande Delta
lies in dating techniques other than tool morphology. Radiocarbon analysis (see Appendix VIII) may be useful in some
situations, particularly in sites where human burials are
found. However, there is a distressing lack of charcoal observed in the subsurface tests excavated during the present
survey. This is felt to be a definite limiting factor in
the usefulness of this particular dating method. The presence
of apparent burned clay hearths at two sites indicates that
the archeomagnetic dating method may be ~ppropriate for
obtaining basic chronological controls in the area.
Future
investigations must take this into account, and attempts
should be made to conduct archeomagnetic analysis where
appropriate features are encountered.
Commensurate with the lack of temporal controls,
there is a problem with named cultural units and their
placement within chronological constructs. At the present
time, a pragmatic approach based on cultural-historical

45

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

development is favored for this region. This includes a
generalized schematic framework composed of four developmental stages which are not dependent on time: Paleo-Indian,
Archaic, Neo-Archaic and Historic. No specific periodicity
is assigned to the first three stages while the fourth, the
Historic Stage, should probably be ascribed a beginning date
of about 200 years before present (B.P.), or A.D. 1750.
The formal Brownsville Focus proposed by MacNeish (1947;
1958) and other similar constructs near the western end of
the project area should probably be laid aside (as suggested
by Hester 1976: 4) until such time as the validity of these
units can be examined on the basis of extensive excavated
data.
Perhaps it is more appropriate, within th"e context
of the stages mentioned above, to view the cultural remains
within the Rio Grande Delta in terms of the maritime/savannah
adaptations as proposed by Hester (1976: 5-9). The artifact
analysis of the materials recovered during the present survey does not indicate recognizable significant changes in
morphology or function of lithic tools from east to west
along the project alignment; however, there are significant
variations in the quantities of lithic tools and debris
along this transect. Few lithics were noted in Environmental
Zone VI where sites are located on clay dunes in the Laguna
Madre estuary system while greater numbers were noted in
the immediately adjacent Zone IV on the deltaic plain and
there are tremendous increases in quantities of lithics
in the inland Zones I and II.
It is significant that
there are no known lithic sources in either Zone IV or
VI, but there are substantial gravel deposits contained
in the geologic strata associated with Zones I and II. Not
only does this reflect a knowledge and utilization of
lithic resources unequally distributed among the environmental zones, it reflects a decreasing frequency of occurrence away from the sources.
"
An opposite distribution holds for the marine
shell artifacts and debris. The greatest numbers of these
items are from Zone VI and IV and the least numbers are
from Zones I and II. Clearly, marine resources were used
mose intensively in their area of occurrence. Freshwater
shells covary in distribution more closely with the lithics
and indicate further support for a dichotomy in the adap- .
tations along the transect represented by the project area.
Hester (1976) does not propose specific boundaries
46

•

CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS

with which to separate the proposed maritime and savannah
adaptations.
In order to provide some direction to future
work in the region, it is proposed that Environmental Zones
IV and VI within the project area represent the basic limits
of a maritime adaptation while Environmental Zones I, II and
IX coincide with a savannah adaptation.
It remains to be
demonstrated whether two (or more) distinct groups inhabited
these defined areas simultaneously and exchanged the goods
which are reflected in the artifact distributions, or whether
a single group ranged over the entire area and the artifact
distributions simply reflect differing activities which were
carried out by that group.
The distribution of an artifact group, columella
projectile points, in relation to the Rio Grande may provide some impetus to the former possibility. As noted
by previous researchers (MacNeish 1947, 1958; Prewitt 1974),
most of the columella points occur south of the river while
few occur north of the river in the delta region. This has
been interpreted to mean that the Rio Grande was a boundary
between prehistoric social groups.
If this is correct, then
the variations noted along the current project alignment could
very well reflect the ranges of distinct groups of people.
It has been suggested (MacNeish 1958; Hester 1969; Prewitt
1974) that those groups practicing a maritime adaptation may
have developed a specialized shell ornament manufacturing
industry and that these goods were traded widely in exchange
for other items such as lithics or ceramics. A microcosm
of such an exchange system may be reflected in the present
survey data as indicated by the presence of a marginella
shell bead in Environmental Zone II and lithic materials
in Zone VI.
Cemetery data which has been reported from the
Rio Grande Delta do not provide useful arguments with
regard to possible variations in the question of maritime
versus savannah adaptations. They do, hoWever, tend to
support the dichotomy of site function within the overall hunting and gathering subsistence system which was
previously discussed and which includes both adaptive areas.
Three types of burials are recognized: single burial, single
event; multiple burial, single event; and multiple burials,
multiple events (true cemeteries). The nature of past investigations precludes confirmation of the association
of human interments within or near habitation sites.
It is here proposed that the differing types of interments
47

•

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

may reflect the function of the sites with which they are
associated (if it may be presumed that in the absence of
thorough investigations that burials are indeed associated
with habitation areas),
Single event interments are interpreted to be reflections of temporary sites. Examples include 41WY50 which
was investigated during the current project and the Unland
Site reported by Mallouf and Zavaleta (1979). There are
differences between these two instances other than the fact
that the Unland Site represents a multiple interment, single
event as opposed to a single interment, single event at
41WY50. Mallouf and Zavaleta (1979: 26-27) suggest that the
three individuals buried in a common grave at Unland may have
suffered death of an unknown cause in a location Bway
from camp and that their remains were later found' and then
buried by other members of their group. There seemed to be
no immediate habitation sites associated although there are
known sites within a short distance of the burial site. The
point of origin for the burial at 41WY50 could not be determined, but thinly distributed habitation debris suggestive
of a temporary camp was noted above the interment.
In both
sites, the implication is that death occurred while the
individuals were away from their main camps (semipermanent
camps as previously defined), and that the bodies were buried
at or near the location where death occurred. This pattern
not only occurs in Environmental Zone IV and VI, but extends
westward into the areas of Zone I, II and IX as indicated at
site 4IHG27 (Hester and Rodgers 1971).
Multiple event interments are interpreted to be
associated with the semipermanent camps and to represent
preferred culturally designated areas for the disposal
of the dead. While Hester and Rodgers' (1971: 370-371)
suggestion that the Arroyo Colorado may have represented
some preferred setting for the placement of· cemeteries
cannot stand in view of the existence of cemeteries away
from that watercourse as demonstrated by site 41CF74 on
Rincon de Guajardo and others (Prewitt 1974: 61), there may
be other reasons why cemeteries occur in those localities.
Each of the known multiple event cemeteries is located near
water sources which are presumed to be relatively dependable. It is predicted that thorough investigations will re-'
veal that each of those sites is associated with a major
habitation site which can be classified as a semipermanent
campsite. As with the single event interments, these sites
transcend environmental zones from east to west. As noted
above, the distributions of the burial sites do not support
the concept of maritime and savannah adaptations, but they
do seem to support the division of the types of campsites
within the region.

ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Table 4, which is included at the end of this section,
contains recommendations for each site. Included in the summary
is information, in sequence by site number, regarding the site
type, assessments expressed in terms of observed disturbance
and expected information yield potential, and recommendations
expressed in terms of project effects and additional work required. The information yield potential is ranked in three
levels: (1) low, (2) limited, and (3) high; however, at three
sites it was not possible to adequately assess the potential,
and these sites are categorized as undetermined. Recommendations indicate the impacts on the sites and/or site areas
which are expected to occur as a result of the construction
operations and the type of work which is felt to be necessary
at each site. The type of work recommended is linked directly
to the expected impacts and to the expected information yield
potential. Where no direct effects are expected to result
from the project, no further work is recommended regardless
of the information yield potential of the sites.
Table 5 summarizes the assessments and recommendations
for each of the isolated finds. As with the sites, assessments
are expressed in terms of disturbance and expected information
yield potential. The potential applies to the general area
surrounding the isolated finds and not to just the specific
spot where the find was made. Recommendations for the isolated
find are expressed in the same terms as for the sites.
The types of work which are recommended are expressed
in the following terms:
(1) no further work; (2) revisit
and make surface cOllection; (3) monitor site and/or adjacent
site area(s) during construction; and (4) test to assess
Nat ion a 1 Reg i s t e r 0 f His tor i c P1ace s eli gi bi 1i ty . 0 n1y the
first and the third categories apply to the isolated finds.
An abbreviated cross-tabulation of the assessments
and recommendations is presented in Table 6. This table is
organized in terms of environmental zone associations and
contains attenuated indications of assessments and recommendations for each site and isolated find.
Testing procedures to provide National Register of
Historic Places eligibility assessments should be designed to
furni sh i nformatioll suffi ci ent to:

51

HIDALGO AND WILLACY COUNTIES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

(1) determine the vertical and horizontal extents
of the sites insofar as they coincide with the right-ofway for the project;
(2) determine the nature and integrity of the sites;
and
(3) provide the basis for preliminary interpretation
of the activities carried out at the sites.
Several additional areas other than those associated
with known site areas are also recommended for monitoring.
These are considered to be areas which exhibit high potential for containing buried cultural materials. Figure 12
illustrates all the areas which are felt to requi.re monitoring.
Monitoring of the construction should be of sufficient
intensity to allow for identification, documentation and
preliminary investigation of any buried sites which may be
encountered. If any previously unrecorded buried sites
are found during the construction operations, monitoring
should allow for immediate investigations adequate to assess
the site's eligibility for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places. If a site is assessed to be
eligible for nomination, construction in that area should
cease until the necessary investigations are concluded.
Monitoring of the known sites should be directed
toward: (1) collecting additional cultural materials; (2)
determining the presence or absence of apparent intact
buried cultural strata; and (3) determining the presence
of intact features such as hearths or burials. If intact
materials and/or debris are encountered and assessed to be
potentially significant, construction at that site should
be halted until such time as preliminary investigations
are completed to the point where the site's potential
eligibility for nomination to the National ~egister
of Historic Places can be assessed.
If the:·site is judged
to be ineligible for nomination, then construction should
be resumed. However, if the site is assessed to be eligible,
then emergency procedures to mitigate the loss of the site
should be initiated and completed before construction is
resumed at that site.
In addition, intensive survey and assessment should
be accomplished along two of the proposed new channel segments
near the western end of the project area in Environmental

Zones I and II; these segments are K-L and L-O. Only two
spot checks were made along K-L and only 28 percent of
L-O was examined during the present survey in conformance
with contract requirements. Based on the field sampling
and the airphoto analysis, it is suspected that there
may be a high density of sites along these two segments.
Therefore, it is felt that the remainder of the two
segments should be subjected to thorough pedestrian
survey and it is predicted that additional significant
sites will be located in these areas.

Cultural Resources Survey and Assessment Along
the Proposed North Ditch, Willacy County, Texas

I NTRODUCTI ON
An archeological survey along the alignment of the
proposed North Ditch in Willacy County, Texas was conducted
by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during October 1980. As it
is currently planned, the North Ditch will extend from the
outfall of the existing Main Floodwater Channel on Laguna
Madre (Point A) westward across the El SaUl Ranch to Point
B south of Willamar (fig. 13). A short segment at the
extreme eastern end and a substantial segment beginning
near the west property line of the El SaUl Ranch and extending
to Point B will coincide with the location of the existing
channel permitted by the Galveston District, Corps of
Engineers, Permit 11374. However, the remainder of the
North Ditch located on the El Saul Ranch will be south of
and parallel to the existing south Main Floodwater Channel.
This variation in the alignment of the ditch has ~een proposed by the local sponsors of the project, Willacy County
Drainage District No.1 and Hidalgo County Drainage District
No.1.
The archeological survey reported in this section
was conducted at the request of the local sponsors and is
concerned only with the North Ditch alignments. This study
is separate from, although complementary to, the larger study
of the permitted project area which has been accomplished by
Prewitt and Associates, Inc., under contract with the Galveston District Corps of Engineers reported in Part I. It should
be pointed out that there are substantial overlaps in this project as it relates to the Federally funded project. The remote
sensing, environmental, historical and technical data studies
conducted for the Federally funded project were expanded to
include the North Ditch alignment. However, it does not
seem necessary or desirable to repeat these studies, in
full, in two separate reports. Rather, they are included
in this joint report.
A crew of four persons spent 1.5 ~~eks conducting
an intensive survey of the North Ditch alignment. Information regarding seven archeological sites was accumulated.
One previously recorded historic site, 41WY34, lies within
or adjacent to the ditch alignment; the remaining six sites
are prehistoric in age. Four of the prehistoric sites are
in areas in which the permitted project alignment and the
North Ditch alignment coincide. Sites 41WY61 and 41WY62
were recorded during the course of the Federally funded
project. Sites 41WY73 and 41WY74 coincide with that project
but were discovered during the North Ditch survey. Sites
41WY71 and 41WY72 are related only to the North Ditch survey
area (see Figure 14 for site locations).

WILLACY COUNTY NORTH DITCH

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Details regarding the previous archeology accomplished in far southern Texas and Northern Tamaulipas, Mexico, can
be found in Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977: 57-88). A restatement of past investigations is contained in Part I of
this report.
ENV IRONMENTAL SETTING
The North Ditch will be dug in an east-west alignment
across the late Pleistocene Beaumont Formation which extends
from the Holocene and Recent estuary system of the Laguna
Madre westward to the eastern edge of Hidalgo County. The
proposed segment of drainage.channel is contained within Environmental Zone IV as defined by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen
(1977: 106). The topography varies from flat to gently undulating and is incised by numerous mud-filled relict distributary channel scars and associated shallow eolian depressions.
Elevation range from less than 3 meters (qpproximately 10 feet)
in the east to nearly 15 meters (approximately 50 feet) above
Mean Sea Level (MSL) in the west. Soils typical of Environmen at 1 Z0 ne IV are com p1ex e s 0 f mea nde r - bel t san ds, a ban don ned
channel and overbank muds, and sand bar accumulations. Soil
associations in the immediate project area consist of Orelia,
sodic variant association, Raymondville association, and
Raymondville-Orelia sodic variant association (Soil Conservation Service, ms. in preparation).
Modern land use has been restricted to rangeland on
the eastern two-thirds of the project area; however,
the western one-third of the project area recently has
been cleared and is now subject to intensive cultivation.
Large portions of the remaining rangeland have been bulldozed
in recent years; the intent has been to clear.the thick
brush in order to facilitate the growth of des·jrable grasses
suitable for livestock forage.
.
Woody vegetation in Environmental Zone IV is dominated
by mesquite, huisache, prickly ash, and in the areas subjected
to bulldozing, recent growths of dense scrub brush. Large
stands of sacahuiste grass grow in the low flat eastern areas·
of the project universe and are interspersed with small, less.
dense, stands of weeds in the topographically lowest areas.
INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES
Field work on this project was directed toward locating
and recording both prehistoric and historic cultural resources.

A site location model was developed on the basis of the
findings of Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977), Prewitt(1974)
and other previous researchers in the Rio Grande Plain. The
site location model assumes that prehistoric sites in the
region may be characterized as either semipermanent or
temporary open camps.
An airphoto analysis was accomplished prior to the
beginning of the field work. Color aerial photos flown
by NASA in November 1972 (scale approximately 1:62 500)
were examined and identifiable topographic features were
transferred to USGS 7.5' topographic sheets. Specific
identifiable features in the North Ditch area (and Environmental Zone IV in general) consist of mud-filled relict
distributary channel scars with associated 1eve e s, and shallow
depressions formed through 'a combined process involving
wet-weather ponding and dry-weather eolian deflation(fig. 15;
also see Part III, Airphoto Analysis).
The locational model is derived by integrating the
assumptions regarding site characteristics and the results
of the airphoto analysis. The predictive model for site
locations states that preferred locations for prehistoric
sites are on the topographically elevated levees of mudfilled relict distributary channel scars and on the slight
elevations surrounding the associated shallow depressions.
These topographic features are expected to have provided
temporary to semipermanent (rarely permanent) water sources
that were attractive to a variety of flora and fauna which
were potentially exploitable by resident groups of aboriginal peoples.
The investigation procedures described in Part I
were also used for this segment of the project. An intensive surface survey of the North Ditch constituted the
first step of the investigations. This was 'followed by the
designation of specific topographic features'along the
North Ditch for further and more intensive investigations.
Each of these areas was reexamined for surficially exposed
remains and a determination for subsurface probes was
made.
Two methods of subsurface testing were utilized.
The first subsurface excavations were 50x50 centimeters and
excavated to a depth of approximately 60 to 70 centimeters.
A total of four units were excavated in Areas 1 and 2(Fig.
14). Two major problems with these excavations occurred.

It is believed that 50x50-centimeter excavations are too small
and do not provide adequate exposure in relation to the
generally low density of material remains within sites
typical of the region. Secondly, the 50x50-centimeter excavations do not allow for adequate depth of excavation. It
is believed that buried sites could easily be missed by this
method.
Failure to locate sites by this method resulted in
the adoption of a strategy using large lxI-meter excavation
units to allow for increased exposure and the attainment of
greater excavation depths.
A total of three lxI-meter units were excavated.
Based on the predictive model, two of these (in Area 4)
were located in high site potential areas and one (in Area
7) was located in a low site potential area. The lxlmeter excavation yielded evidence of two prehistoric sites
(41WY71 and 41WY72) and supported the predicted nonexistence
of a site in Area 7.
Each test unit consisted of I-meter squares oriented
with the aid of a compass to the cardinal directions. A
temporary datum was established at the highest corner of
the unit. A string line, line level and hand tape were
used to maintain relative elevations from the ground surface.
Information recorded for each of the 50x50-centimeter
excavations included relative depth from ground surface,
a measured sketch of the profile, and written description.
Additional information recorded for the lxI-meter excavations
includes descriptions of visible strata. All of the excavation units were backfilled following completion of
field documentation.
SURV EY RESULTS
One historic site and six prehistoric sites were found
on or near the alignments of the proposed North Ditch. The
prehistoric site, 41WY34, was recorded during the previous .reconnaissance by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen(1977: 134).
This site is identified on the basis of the current survey
as the location of Palo Blanco Ranch. Of the six prehistoric
sites found to exist along the North Ditch alignment, two
41WY61 and 41WY62) were discovered during the Federally
funded project, two (41WY71 and 41WY72) were found through
the excavation of lxI-meter units and two (41WY73 and
41WY74) were found through surficially exposed debris.

CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS

Data gathered from six prehistoric sites provides several basic clues regarding the general nature of
the sites in addition to locational preference. First,
the range of materials and debris which may be expected
wi thi nasi te i ncl udes 1i thi cs, freshwater shell s, mari ne
shell s, bones and burned cl ay 1umps. Second, these
materials may be expected to be thinly distributed within
any given site. Third, sites will not be surficially
exposed except in those instances where modern activities
have penetrated to a sufficient depth to disturb buried
materials and have provided a mechanism for transporting
the materials to the surface. Fourth, buried sites may
be restricted in their vertical extent and are probably
related to identifiable fossil genetic soil horizons.
Detailed descriptions of the individual sites and
the materials collected are provided in Part III, Appendix
IV, Site Descriptions, of this report. A summary of the
assessments is provided in the final section of Part II,
Assessments and Recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATJONS
Site distribution along the North Ditch was found
to be consistent with that observed along the existing
channel alignment across environmental Zone IV, and
supports the predictive model of site location and environmental relationships.
Prehistoric sites were found on the low levees adjacent to mud-filled relict distributary channel scars and
associated eolian depressions.
It appears that a number of
buried sites may exist which were not located during the
present survey. The surface sites which were documented
consist of thinly distributed scatters of cultural materials.
In the case of 41WY73, it is questionable· whether the designation of the locality as a site is valid.
If 41WY73 is a site,
then a substantial portion of it is buried.
While it is premature to present detailed interpretations of the meager artifactual materials recovered from
the prehistoric sites along the North Ditch, several ob-'
servations and interpretations are in order.
(1) No specific age can be assigned to the sites
other than that they are prehistoric.

77

•

WILLACY COUNTY NORTH DITCH

(2) Durable tools were made from both lithic and
shell resources.
(3) Lithic tool manufacturing/reduction activities
were carried out at the sites.
(4) The groups either ranged widely or engaged in
trade to procure lithic resources from areas at least 48
kilometers (30 miles) to the west.
(5) The groups exploited marine resources as well
as coastal prairie and estuary resources.
(6) Animals utilized include freshwater,mussels
and small-to-large-sized mammals.

(7) The presence of burned clay lumps indicates
portable cooking/heating activities.
(8) Based on
of debris at any given
groups is estimated to
perhaps small extended

the thinly dispersed limited quantities
site, the size of the aboriginal
have been limited to nuclear, or
family units.

(9) The high site densities suggest two alternative explanations: (a) the groups were highly mobile; camps
were moved frequently (perhaps seasonally) with numerous
temporary camps occupied in the vicinity of semipermanent
(seasonal) camps; or (b) the area was sparsely occupied
on a seasonal basis over a long period of time.
The historic site, 41WY34, is the site of the Palo
Blanco Ranch which dates from at least as early as the 1880's
to the early 1900's. This site has been damaged by recent
brush clearing, and it appears to be located marginally to,
but out of, the easement for the North Ditch'. Palo Blanco
is one of many small dispersed ranches established in the
region during the nineteenth century. It was incorporated
into the extensive King Ranch system in the late 1800's
(see Part III, Appendix I, Historical Background). The
site is expected to contain information relative both to
a restricted time period (roughly 1870 to 1920) and to a
restricted economic activity (ranching).
ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The sparse amounts of cultural debris observed along
the North Ditch primarily serve as positive indicators of
78

•

•

ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

the presence of prehistoric and historic sites. Further work
is necessary to determine the area extent, chronologic placement, range of activities, specific adaptations, and relative
importance of these sites.
The assessments for each site are summarized in Table
7. These are expressed in terms of expected information yield
potential and are divided into three ranking groups: (1) low
potential, (2) limited potential, and (3) high potential. The
recommendations which are also summarized in Table 7 are tied
directly to the assessed level of information yield potential
and to the expected impacts upon each site which will be
affected as a result of construction of the North Ditch.
The recommendat'ions are expressed in t'erms of test
excavations to assess National Register of Historic Places
eligibility, or of monitoring to ensure that sites thought
to be of limited potential do not in actuality contain
significant features such as human burials.
Site-specific recommendations are as follows:
(1) sites 41WY71 and 41WY72 should be tested to assess their
eligibility for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, and (2) monitoring of construction activitieS
in the areas of sites 41WY34, 41WY61, 41WT62, 41WY73 and
41WY74 to ensure that significant elements or features in the
sites are not disrupted. Testing should be sufficient in
scope to (1) determine the vertical and horizontal extents
of the sites insofar as they coincide with the right-of-way
for the North Ditch; (2) determine the nature of the sites;
and (3) provide the basis for preliminary interpretations
of the activities carried out at the sites.
In addition to the specific site areas noted
above, monitoring should be carried out over a large
portion of the North Ditch as indicated in Figure 16.
These areas have been identified as having high potential
for containing buried sites on the basis of the airphoto
analysis (Part III, Appendix III). The monitoring should
be intensive and should be directed toward the identification,
documentation and preliminary investigation of buried sites.
In the event such buried sites are found, the monitoring
should be of sufficient scope to provide for immediate
testing to assess the potential eligibility of the sites
for nomination to the the National Register of Historic
Places.

INTROOUCTION
The report published by the Texas Historical
Commission, "A Predictive Assessment of Cultural Resources
in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties, Texas" (Mallouf, Baskin
and Killen 1977), includes a thorough summary of the history
of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Consequently, this report
will present in detail only that information which is
necessary to a discussion of the specific project area.
The history of the Lower Rio Grande Valley may be
divided into four phases:
(1) Early Spanish exploration from 1519 to 1746;
(2) Spanish settlement from 1746 to 1836;
(3) Lower Rio Grande Valley history prior to the
railroad and land development from 1836 and 1904; and
(4) Lower Rio Grande Valley history after railroad
construction from 1904.
For purposes of this report, the first two historical
phases are presented in a combined section while the latter
two are presented individually. Each section is further
divided as appropriate for discussion and presentation.
It should be noted that numerous potential informants
were contacted, although the information obtained from them
was not used directly in the preparation of this narration;
a listing of those informants and the dates they were
interviewed is included following the References Cited. A
comprehensive literature search was also conducted in the
course of this study; the many references encounter~d . 't
which were not cited directly are included in a final section entitled "Literature Search".
EARLY SPANISH EXPLORATION AND S~TTLEMENT
Early explorers who traveled through the Lower Rio
Grande Valley included Alonzo Alvarez de Pineda (1519),
Diego de Camargo (1520), Gonzalo de Ocampo (1523), and
Sancho de Caniedo (1528) in the sixteenth century; and
Sergeant Major Jacinto Garcia de Sepulveda (1638) and
Captain Alonso de Leon (1685 and 1686) in the seventeenth
century.
In 1746 Don Jose de Escandon, the Count of Sierra
Gorda, was made governor of the newly established province
87

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

of Nuevo Santander (which included the present project
area). His most significant duty was to explore and
colonize this section of Mexico. Escandon dispatched
four expeditions from separate points to survey the region
and to locate sites which were feasible for settlement.
Escandon, Blass Maria de 1a Garza Falcon, Miguel de 1a
Garza Falcon, and Orobio y Basterra led these expeditions
through different areas of Nuevo Santander with the
groups finally reassembling near the mouth of the Rio
Grande in 1747 (Ma11ouf, Baskin and Killen 1977: 29-33;
Bolton 1912).
As a result of the expedition surveys, fourteen
villas (towns) were planned; twelve of these were located south of the Rio Grande. However, by 1755 Escandon
had established twenty-three villas and fifteen missions
within Nuevo Santander. All of the villas were civil
towns with defense of the area given to the citizens and
to only a few soldiers; this represented a new concept
in terms of the methods of Spanish colonization. Villas
which were established near the present project area
include Camargo, Mier and Reynosa, which were located
along the southern (right) bank of the Rio Grande. The
principal economic activities associated with these
villas were ranching, salt trade, and limited agriculture (Ma11ouf, Baskin and Killen 1977: 33-35).
SPANISH LAND GRANTS
In 1765 a Royal Commission from the Spanish
Crown conducted a General Visit to the villas in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley with the stated purpose of
granting titles of land to those individuals who were
settled in these villas or within their jurisdictions.
As a result of the Visit, a number of porciones were
assigned to certain individuals within the" five Rio
Grande jurisdictions of Laredo, Revilla (Guerro), Mier,
Camargo and Reynosa in 1767.
The porciones were long, narrow, individual
grants intended for agricultural and grazing purposes.
Each grant, equivalent to approximately one league, was
11 to 16 miles long and nearly one mile wide. Each
contained frontage on the Rio Grande in order to provide
access to water (Fig. 17). The variations in length and
width of the grants depended upon the number of inhabitants within each jurisdiction to be accommodated and

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

the exact amount of land accorded each settler. The
size of the porcion granted to a particular individual
was determined by his length of residence in the frontier
settl ements (Scott 1 966: 99).
Large tracts of land without guaranteed water
sources were granted to certain individuals for grazing
and ranching during the period of 1767 to 1810. Application for these lands required that formal procedures
be followed, and approval by the Spanish Crown often took
several years (Scott 1966: 99). After the appl i cant's
request was approved by the proper authorities, the land
was advertised for sale in keeping with the law. In most
cases the applicant was the sole bidder and the title to
the land was transferred to his name. The governor of
Nuevo Santander appraised the land, and the grantee paid
whatever monetary conside'ration was required (Harding
Files 1980).
A third group of grants for unclaimed or vacant
lands was assigned between the years 1770 and 1810. In
order to initiate and maintain ownership, the grantee
was obliged to formally take possession of the land
with a prescribed ceremony and to maintain a permanent
resi dence on the 1and (Scott 1966: 99).
When a grant was accepted from the Spanish Crown,
it was made official by the ritual "Acts of Possession."
According to the procedure described by Scott, the chief
justice of the jurisdiction led the grantee to his property and "passed him to the four wi nds." The grantee
then pulled weeds from the soil, threw stones, and gave
thanks to God and to the Crown. Cornerstones were
arranged, after which attorneys and witnesses signed
the validation papers. These papers were subsequently
recorded in "the town of jurisdiction, the capital of
Nuevo Santander, and in the public archiv~s of Mexico
City" (Scott 1966: 66-69).
The present project area crosses several of
these large land grants and porciones from the Laguna
Madre toward the Rio Grande; included are: San Juan
de Carricitos; Las Mestinas, Pititas y la Abra; San
Salvador de Tule; Llano Grande; La Blanca; and porciones
48-75 of the Reynosa jurisdiction (Fig. 17).
The San Juan de Carricitas Grant of 106t leagues
(601,657 acres) was approved by Spain in 1702 for Jose

Narcosco Cabazos (Scott 1966: 148). The largest of all the
grants between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers, it
encompassed most of Willacy and parts of Cameron, Hidalgo
and Kenedy counties.
The Las Mestinas, Pititas y la Abra tract, also
known as the Mestinas Grant, of 29,374.95 acres was granted
to Vicente de Hinojosa in 1798. An L-shaped grant, it was
located west and south of San Juan de Carricitos. Hinojosa
sold the eastern 12 leagues, known as Ojo de Agua, to his
sister, Rosa Maria Hinojosa de 8alli*. This portion of
the grant was located south of the San Juan de Carricitos
Grant and adjacent to the Espiritu Santa Grant (Stambaugh
and Stambaugh 1954: 40) . .
The San Salvador de Tule tract of 3l5~39l acres
was granted to Rosa Baili 's son, Juan Jose Balli, in 1794.
It was located north and east of Las Mestinas. According
to Scott, Balli "succeeded his grandfather as Chief Justice of the town of Reynosa and, no doubt, by virtue of
this position was of great assistance to his mother in
securing a large share of the Rio Grande Valley" (Scott
1966: 104).
.
The Llano Grande tract was part of a joint application by Juan Jose Balli and Rosa Maria Balli for 53,140.8
acres. The Llano Grande Grant, containing approximately
25 leagues, and the La Feria Grant, containing approximately
12 leagues, were approved in 1777 as a joint grant (Taylor
1976: 7).
Porciones 48-75 on the left bank of the Rio Grande
in the Reynosa jurisdiction were granted to the inhabitants
of Reynosa. The grantees are listed as follows:

The family names of Ynojosa or Hinojosa, and
Balli, Valli, or Vallin are seen on land g"rants and on
official records throughout the Spanish Colonial period
in South Texas. Both families were from Reynosa and they
intermarried in order to exercise and maintain both
political and economic power in the region. The families
gained control of a large number of land grants in the
belief that the value of the property would increase.
The lands they acquired were considered desolate and
uninhabitable by the members of the first official
inspection. The threat of hostile Indians combined with
the lack of dependable supplies of fresh water made

Office. Those in Scott's book are based upon the 1767
Act of the Visit of the Royal Commissions to the Town of "
Reynosa. Unclaimed and sequestered lands were reassigned
between 1770 and 1810. Due to the changes during that
period, the list used here is taken from the General
Land Office records.

occupation and ranching of this area very risky (Scott 1966:
106). It was a considerable gamble to invest in settlements and ranching in the area known as the Wild Horse
Desert and surrounding regions. The enterprise of this
extended family was a major factor in maintaining the
ranching communities throughout the Lower Rio Grande Valley
until major development pressures began at the close of the
nineteenth century.
Around 1800 land was considered a commodity of
little actual value. Scott describes the economic state
as follows:
six porciones of land or a total
of 26,168 acres was worth about seventy
pesos; a 990d horse sold from four to
six pesos; mules, thirty pesos per pair;
cows, five pesos; goats, fifty centarios
. . . . The greatest expense in those
days was a funeral which was apt to cost
from one hundred seventy to five hundred
pesos (Scott 1966: 107).

As a part of legal reorganization of the Lower Rio
Grande Valley area following the independence and statehood of Texas, all grants from the previous jurisdictions
of Spain and Mexico were reviewed to determine their validity. Further, the lands were to be fully "surveyed,
mapped, and patented." The revalidatioD was necessary
toe s tab 1ish tit 1e and to con ve r t the o·w.n e r s hip 0 f the
property from Spanish and Mexican civil law to United States
common law. A second purpose was to identify the thousands
of acres of vacant land between the Nueces and the Rio Grande
rivers claimed by the State of Texas as public lands. These
included unassigned lands and various grants reclaimed by
or forfeited to the Cro~ln (Scott 1966: 146-147). No grant
awarded by the Mexi can government after December 1g, 1836,
was recognized by the State of Texas inasmuch as it considered the area between the Nueces and the Rio Grande
rivers as part of Texas from that date forward (Scott 1966:
1 53) .

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

After the Texas Revolution, the Republic of Texas
and then the State of Texas made land grants for two
purposes. To encourage the construction of railroads,
four to twenty sections of land per completed mile of
track were granted to railroad companies. The Texas
and Pacific Railway Company received as much as 5,167,360
acres in this manner (Allhands 1931: 35). Large blocks
of land in Hidalgo and Cameron counties were awarded to
railroad companies such as the Gulf Colorado and Santa
Fe Railroad, the Texas Mexican Railway Company, and the
Georgetown Railroad (Langermann 1880; Cocke 1884).
Approximately 24,453,000 acres of land were also granted
to soldiers in various parts of the state as bonuses for
service to the Republic and the State (Allhands 1931:
35). Some of thi s 1and was located in the Lower Ri 0
Grande Valley (Lea 1957: 109).
During 1849 and 1850 the Bourland-Miller Commission investigated titles in Webb, Starr and Cameron
counties; the purpose was to review all large land
grants to determine whether or not the customs of the
former governments regarding ownership had been followed.
After reviewing the San Juan de Carricitos; San Salvador
de Tule, and Mestinas grants, the Commissioners found
that the hei rs of the ori 9i nal grantees had not sati sfactorily followed the customs requiring permanent
residence and ranchin9. It was therefore recommended
that the grants be considered null and the property be
reclaimed as Texas public land (Taylor 1976: 6, 12, 86).
As mi9ht be expected, lengthy court proceedin9s
followed the conclusion of the Commission's work. The
litigation was complicated by the fact that the field
notes, original titles, and written testimony collected
were lost when the steamboat Anson, upon which the
Commissioners were traveling, sank in rough seas near
the strait at Brazos Santi ago (Taylor 1976:,3). The
lists of titles which were considered valid were confirmed by the Legislature on September 4, 1850, and on
February 18, 1852. Additional legislation in 1860,
1870, and 1901 provided further confirmations to land
claims by heirs of the original grantees (Taylor 1976:
3). Those grants not validated and those contested by
various heirs were involved in litigation for many years.
The San Juan de Carricitos grant was one of
those which the Commission recommended should revert

94

HISTORY PRIOR TO RAILROAD AND LAND DEVELOPMENT

to the State of Texas. The evidence presented by the heirs
stated that Cabazos had taken possession of the grant in
1792 in the presence of witnesses according to the prescribed custom of pulling weeds, tossing stones, and
reciting prayers. Cabazos stocked the land with 900 head
of animals and remained in residence until 1811 when Indian
raids caused the family and workers to retreat from the
area; however, it was not the intention of the family to
cease possession of the land entirely (Taylor 1976: 11-12).
In the Texas Legislature "omnibus bill of 1852, providing
patents for Valley Lands, the title was vested in the
Cavazos [sic] hei rs" (Scott 1966: 149). The formal di vi si on
among the heirs occurred in 1889 after Captain Richard King,
who had acquired possession of the rights of several of the
heirs, sued the remaining heirs for partition (Harding Files
1980).
'
SETTLEMENTS
Unfortunately, little written information exists
concerning early settlements north of the Rio Grande. The
maps which include the region generally. show very little
detail. The two most useful maps are an 1880 Hidalgo County
map by A. L. Langermann and an 1884 Cameron County map by
J. J. Cocke. Other maps which offer additional information
are Stephen F. Austin's 1830 Map of Texas with parts of
adjoining states, Charles Pressler's 1867 Travelers Map
of the State of Texas, and George N. Coffey's 1909 Soils
Survey Map of Hidalgo County.
The Handbook of Texas (Webb
1952a, 1952b) gives some information concerning settlements, and
scattered newspaper articles refer to some of the settlements
located in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The available maps
and written references show ranches, major settlements, salt
lakes, and water stops connected by a network of roads
(Fig. 17).
Prior to the establishment of the railroad, Brownsville
was the only settlement in Hidalgo and Cameron counties
(i ncl udi ng modern Wi 11 acy County) whi ch could be cl assifi ed
as a city. The population of other settlements, mostly
ranchos, varied from a few families to fifteen or twenty
families. The ranchos, usually run by a foreman and worked
by Mexican laborers, depended upon cattle, sheep and go~ts
for food, with little agriculture being practiced (Doyon 1956:
66-67) .

95

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

Near the Rio Grande, where soil was more fertile
and water more accessible, settlements were close together; on the interior prairies, where water was scarce,
the ranchos were larger and the settlements more widely
dispersed. Each rancho, whether it was situated along
the river or was connected to one of the well-traveled
stage routes, was virtually a self-sustaining establishment.
Although communications were restricted, the
ranchos were connected by a network of roads and were
not totally isolated. The routes taken from one place
to another varied according to season and amounts of
recent rainfall. In his book on the King Ranch, Tom Lea
describes the road from Brownsville to Corpus Christi as
165 miles in length and irvolving a four- or five-day
trip on horseback. Water was scarce except after rains
when drainage collected in low areas and "[i]t required
a man familiar both with the country and the season to
locate the seeps and sweet water bogs where thirst could
be slaked" (1957: 94).
The exact route between Brownsville and Corpus
Christi varied depending upon the season and the rainfall. There were, for exampl e, several crossi ngs of
the Arroyo Colorado on that route. The best known and
the most heavily traveled was Paso Real which was located due north from Brownsville; another was Paso de
las Tavernas to the east of Paso Real and close to the
mouth of the Arroyo Colorado at the Laguna Madre (Cocke
1884). It is possible that other crossings also
existed, but no substantial information concerning
their exact locations has been found (Champion 1980).
Colonization efforts throughout the Lower Rio
Grande Valley continued into the nineteenth century
but were thwarted for a variety of reasons',including
political unrest, Indian raids, and unfavoY"able climatic conditions. Political instability was caused by
the turmoil created by the Texas Revolution in 18351836, the annexation of Texas into the United States
and the Mexican War in 1845, raids by the bandits
Carvej al and Corti na in the 1850 's, and Ci vi 1 War
actions from 1863-65.

HISTORY PRIOR TO RAILROAD AND LAND DEVELOPMENT

SETTLEMENTS WITHIN THE PROJECT AREA
Information gathered on ranchos and other settlements located close to or within the project area is given
below. Locational data is derived from Cocke's 1884
Cameron County map, which was transferred to 1970 USGS
7.5' topographic sheets. Many of the rancho names and
sites are carried over on current property maps and as names
of rural cemeteries. Generally, wherever a cemetery is
located there was a settlement nearby. The settlements are
discussed in sequenti al order from the project's outfall on
the Laguna Madre westward through Willacy and Hidalgo
counties. Because of its importance to the local history
and its relationship to the project area, the El Sauz Ranch
is treated in greater detail than are the other settlements.
Loma Alta, meaning high hill, is located in the
cl ay dunes north of the outfall (3.8 ki lometers south of
FM 497,15.4 kilometers east of Willamar). Twenty-five
leagues of land including Loma Alta and its dependent ranches
were purchased by Richard King in 1874 (Lea 1957: 303). The
first headquarters of the El Sauz division of the King Ranch
was located here, but it was later moved to its present
location on higher ground (Valley By-Liners 1975: 47-48).
Palo Blanco, meaning hackberry tree, is located
southwest of Loma Alta (5 kilometers south of FM 497, 8.6
ki lometers east of Wi 11 amar). It appears as a rancho on
Cocke's 1884 map; this identification is confirmed by
evidence in Mallouf, Baskin and Killen's 1977 report which
recorded the locality as site 41WY34. Artifacts recovered
include light green bottle glass, sherds of undecorated
earthenware ceramics, and a cartridge casing. Local
informants indicated that this site was one of a network
of ranchos in the area (Mallouf, Baskin and Ki.llen 1977:
134; also see Site Descriptions, Part 1.11, this report).
San Franci sco,
northeast of Loma Alta
7.7 kilometers east of
rancho on Cocke's 1884
USGS San Perlita South

meani ng Sai nt Franci s, is located
(4.3 kilometers south of FM 497,
Willamar). It is indicated as a
map and as a windmill on the 1970
7.5' topographic map.

Ebanito, meaning little ebony tree, is west of,
San Franci sco (4 ki lometers south of FM 497, 4.2 ki lometers
east of Willamar). Cocke's 1884 map identifies it as a
rancho located 1 kilometer west of the main road between
Paso Real and El Sauz.
97

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

Mu1atos, meaning mixed breed, is south of
Ebanito and San Francisco (5.2 kilometers south of FM
497,4.9 kilometers southeast of l1i11amar). It is shown
as a rancho on the road from Paso Real to E1 Sauz on
Cocke's 1884 map and as a windmill on the 1970 USGS San
Perlita South 7.5' topographic map.
Laguna Larga, meaning big lake, is located west
of Mu1atos along the road from Paso Real to La Sal Vieja
(1.8 kilometers south of Willamar, .9 kilometer west of
FM 1420). It is indicated as a rancho on Cocke's 1884
map; currently there is a cemetery by that name at the
appropriate location which confirms the site designation.
The name also appears on a 1970 property map as an
identifier for a section of land in the immediate
vi ci nity (Beard 1970).
La Jarita, meaning little jar or vessel, is
located west of Las Rucias (2 kilometers southeast of
the intersection of FM 498 and FM 1420). It is located
as a rancho on Cocke's 1884 map and a cemetery by that
name exists today in the immediate vicinity. It was a
stop on the stagecoach route from Paso Real to E1 Sauz
(north) and to the salt lakes (west) (Parker 1980).
The name is used on a 1970 property map to identify a
ranch at that location (Beard 1970).
Como se Llama, meaning "What is your name?,"
is a lake located at Lyford immediately northwest of the
intersection of State Highway 448 and FM 498. On Cocke's
1884 map it is on a north-south road extending from the
Rio Grande to San Antonio. A local informant indicated
that there was a road from Paso Real, on the Arroyo
Colorado, through Como se Llama to La Sal Vieja. Situated at the junction of these two roads, the site was
used as a water and stagecoach stop because of a dependable well and lake. It is on the edge of a large
depression which collects runoff after a rain, and it
holds water most of the year. After Hurricane Beulah
in 1967, however, the water in the lake turned salty and
was no longer usable for stock or agricultural purposes
(Keene 1980). Como se Llama was also mentioned by Tom
Lea as an encampment of Rip Ford's Confederate forces
during the Rio Grande Expedition; again, it was chosen
because of the dependable well on the site (Lea 1957:
225) .

HISTORY PRIOR TO RAILROAD AND LAND DEVELOPMENT

San Mateos, meaning Saint Matthew, is located 4.8
kilometers west of Lyford. At one time it was owned by
members of the Cabazos family (Johnson 1980); since that
time it has been subdivided into smaller properties and
sold for farming activities.
Sabino, meaning cypress tree, is located west of
San Mateos (10 kilometers east of Lyford). It was a cattle
ranch owned by James B. Wells and is included on Cocke's
1884 map. In 1903 Wells sold 12,136.35 acres to the St.
Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railroad. In 1912 the
property was sold to the Wahlin, Johnson and Matson Land
Company from Minneapolis, Minnesota. It adjoins the
property known as the Turner Tract (Harding Files 1980).
Stockholm, named after Stockholm, Sweden, is
located on FM 1422 between FM 1425 and FM 491. A cemetery
at that site represents the remnants of a Swedish settlement located within the Turner Tract; the community
included a school, church, mercantile, and cotton gin.
Cotton was the principal crop of the Swedes, although
they also engaged in limited vegetable farming. There
were as many as fi fteen fami 1i es 1i vi ng'i n the tract, and
the Lyford newspaper, Gulf Current, published a section of
news from the Turner Tract; however, there is no extant
physical evidence of the settlement other than the cemetery
(Harding Files 1980).
Las Burras, meaning the mules, is a former ranch
located 1.5 kilometers southwest of the intersection of
FM 491 and FM 2629 (Johnson 1980). It appears on Langermann's 1880 map and Cocke's 1884 map. The cemetery at
that site is highly overgrown and surrounded by plowed
fields. It was designated as an archeological site, 41HG82,
during the present survey.
Panchi ta, named for an early reS.i dent, is. 61
kilometer north of Las Burras. The owner, Fred Johnson,
was named postmaster at that station in 1898. Mail arrived
by horseback from Progreso on the Rio Grande (Johnson 1980;
Offi ci al Records of the U.S. Postmaster General in the
Harding Files 1980). It does not appear on the Langermann
1880 map or the Cocke 1884 map.
San Jose, meaning St. Joseph, was located south
of Las Burras and appears as a rancho on Cocke's 1884 map.
The San Jose Ranch Cemetery in the immediate vicinity marks
the site location today.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

Monte Alto, meani ng hi gh woods, is located 8.8
kilometers north of Elsa on FM 88. It was originally
known as Rollo, named for W. E. Harding's son. It was
one of the townsites prepared for development by the
Harding and Gill Company (see Development Companies
section of this report). Delta Lake, also known as
Monte Alto Lake, 3.3 kilometers northeast of Monte Alto,
was the site of Harding and Gill's development company
clubhouse. Prospective buyers from allover the United
States were entertained there. Monte Alto is very close
to the site where the remains of Fr. Peter Keralum were
discovered in a dense thicket of brush ten years after
his mysterious disappearance in 1872. Two cowboys
searching for some cattle found his saddle, bones, and
missionary accoutrements (Doyon 1956: 147-151).
La Vi 11 a, meani ng' the town, is located 27 ki 10meters east of Edinburg in the Llano Grande Grant assigned to Juan Jose Hinojosa de Balli in 1777. It is said
to have been settled by ranchers from Mexico around 1750
and to have been an adobe village by 1800. La Villa was
a stop on the Texas and New Orleans (T&NO) Railroad
bui lt in 1927 (Webb 1952b:37).
Edcouch, named for Ed Couch, a local landowner
and banker, was developed in 1927 as a stop on the T&NO
Railroad.
Elsa, named for Elsa George, the wife of a local
developer;-Ts said to have ori gi nally been settled
prior to 1800 by ranchers from Mexico (Webb 1952a: 563).
It was subdivided in 1927 when it became a stop on the
T&NO Railroad.
McAllen, south of Edinburg, was named for John
McAllen, an early rancher and merchant in the Valley.
When the town was first developed in 1908;,John McAllen
established West McAllen and the Rio Bravo Irrigation
Company established East McAllen; the latter town dominated in terms of development and growth (Allhands
1931: 129).
Mercedes, located east of McAllen, was part of
the 90,000-acre Capisallo Ranch owned by Jim Wells in
the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1904
Wells sold the property to Lon C. Hill who cleared the
brush and established Lonsboro (Gilliland 1964: 11-12).
100

HISTORY PRIOR TO RAILROAD AND LAND DEVELOPMENT

Hill sold the property to the Yoakum Syndicate, also known
as the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company,
from St. Louis and the name was changed to -Mercedes
(Allhands 1931: 121-122). The company set a pattern for
other towns which followed. The irrigation system, completed in 1905, was touted as the most costly and the most
comprehensive in the country at that time. It served
200,000 acres of land which produced sugar cane, alfalfa
and garden truck as well as orange and pecan groves
(Harding Files 1980). 8y 1907 Mercedes was the home of
the Hidalgo County Bank and The Enterprise, a weekly newspaper (Allhands 1931: 121-122).
Edinburg, named for Edinburgh, Scotland, was originally known as Chapin after County Judge D. ,. Chapin.
It was developed by the San Antonio and Rio Grande Valley
Railroad Company. In 1908 the town was connected by rail
to the Sam Fordyce Branch as part of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railroad. On October 10, 1908, Hidalgo
County voted to move the county seat of government from
the original site of Edinburg near the Rio Grande to Chapin
(Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1954: 177). After the move, Chapin
was known as Edinburg and the former townsite which had been
known as Edinburg became known as Hidalgo.
Alton, west of Edinburg, was established as a stop
on the San Benito and Rio Grande Valley Railroad around
1911 (Webb 1952a: 37).
El Sauz Ranch
Of the numerous moderate-to-large-scale ranching
enterprises close to and within the project area, the
largest owned by a single entity is the El Sauz Ranch.
It is currently owned by Mrs. Helen Pinnell of Chicago.
The El Sauz is one of the most famous r~nches within the
Lower Rio Grande Valley and numerous references to its
history are available.
The El Sauz Ranch was part of the San Juan de
Carricitos Grant to Jose Narcisco Cabazos in 1792. About
1870 Richard King requested his attorney, Stephen Powers,
to purchase derechos (rights) to particular land grants
which were desirably located. The process of acquiring
titles to these interests in the San Juan de Carricitos
Grant extended over a number of years, and, as with many
parcels of land purchased by King, he secured title to
and paid for El Sauz at least twice. In 1873 he purchased
101

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

El Sauz Ranch for $4,000.00 from Maria Clemencia Garcia,
who had inherited it from Jose Maria Cabazos (Lea 1957:
461, n. 18). In 1879 King again purchased El Sauz, this
time from Francisco Fuentes of Matamoros for $1,000.00;
it was described as "two . . . leagues of land upon which
is si tuated and embraces the Rancho 'El Sauz,' together
with any and all improvements upon and appertaining to
said ranch . . . . "* Fuentes had purchased the property
from Juan Prado, administrator of the Juan Nepomucena
Cabazos estate, deceased June 1877 (Cameron County
Supplemental Records of Real Estate D: 661-662; Harding
Files 1980).
As a result of these purchases, King and the
sixty-seven heirs of Cabazos each claimed portions of
the 106! leagues. King sued the heirs, who held the
land in common, for division of title, and the final
Decree of Partition was rendered on May 29, 1889 (Lea
1957: 461, n. 18). A fami ly tree enumerati ng the hei rs
of Jose Narcisco Cabazos and the amount of their
derechos was filed in this case.
The final partition
decree divided their interests into "shares." Current
property maps and titles often refer to Share "X" whi ch
can be traced to the formal division in 1889. King
continued to add to his El Sauz holdings; according to
an article in the 1874 Corpus Christi Gazette, King had
recently purchased "the Loma Alto [sic] and dependent
ranches, twenty-five leagues out of an original Spanish
grant of 106 [sic] leagues, known as San Juan de
Carricitos" (Harding Files 1980; Lea 1957: 303).
In 1847 King hired Edward B. Raymond to start up
the El Sauz Ranch, or what is today known as the
Southern Division of the King Ranch. Raymond, originally from Austin, had been involved with several
cattle drives to Dodge City, Kansas, before he went
to work with the King Ranch. Raymond also>owned his
own ranches, one of which was Las Majadas (Sheepfold),
located east of Raymondville. Raymondville was named

*R. King purchased another ranch in Starr County in 1886
also called El Sauz (Lea 1955: 409). Many names are
used more than once throughout the Lower Rio Grande
Valley and thus should be distinguished by the location
in order to avoid confusion.

for him when the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railroad
was built through a portion of his property in 1904
(Valley By-Liners 1978: 117-120).
The headquarters of the new division was first
located at Loma Alta and was later transferred to higher
ground (the present site). The El Sauz headquarters was
a "community which included a stagecoach stop, a telegraph
operator and postmaster (Raymond), a schoolhouse and a
commissary (Valley By-Liners 1975: 47-48). Raymond constructed the main house at El Sauz using his father's
patented formula for Litchiolla concreta, a sun-dried brick.
The ranch house, which withstood numerous hurricanes which
visited the area, was demolished by the owners early in 1980.
George Durham succeeded E. B. Raymond"' as foreman of
El Sauz. During the 1875-76 campaign to restore order in
the Nueces Strip (the area between the Nueces and the Rio
Grande rivers), Durham rode with a special force of Texas
Rangers under Captain L. H. McNelly. When the force was
disbanded, Durham signed on as bodyguard to Captain King
and worked in the cow camps at the Laureles and Santa
Gertrudis divisions. He married Caroline Chamberlain,
Mrs. King's niece, and moved into a house Captain King
built for them at El Sauz in 1882. Durham was succeeded
as foreman of the El Sauz Division by two of his sons and
a nephew (Durham 1962).
When Mrs. Henrietta King, Captain Richard King's
wife, died in 1925, she apportioned her estate among her
four children or their heirs. Alice Kleberg was the only
one of her children to survive her; the heirs of the
other three children received the portion due to their
parents. Alice Kleberg received the Santa Gertrudis and
Laureles divisions which were known as the northern sector
of the ranch. The Norias and El Sauz, ~hich formed the
southern sector, were divided into the Norias West Ranch
and the Norias East Ranch. The heirs of her deceased son,
Richard King II, received the Norias West Ranch, also known
as the Santa Fe Ranch. The Norias East Ranch was divided
equally between the other two families. One-half went to
Henrietta Welton Page, the only heir of Ella King Welton;
the other half went to Nettie King Atwood's heirs,
Elizabeth Atwood Baldwin, Edwin Atwood, Alice Atwood,
and Richard Atwood. Henrietta Page and Elizabeth Baldwin
sold their inheritance and their share of the estate debt
to Alice Kleberg. The remaining three-eighths of the East

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

NoriasRanch, known as El Sauz Division, went to Edwin,
Alice, and Richard Atwood. Richard's property was
established as a trust to provide him with monthly
maintenance and support. His inheritance was to be
forfeited at his death to his brother and sisters unless
he recovered his health (Lea 1957: 631-633).
Alice and Edwin Atwood filed suit against the
administrators of the estate in 1933. Their share of the
King estate remained in litigation until 1950 when Edwin
Atwood accepted the disposition of the court that the inheritance was not discriminatory and would remain as
originally stated in Mrs. King's will.
When Alice Atwood ,died in 1965, her entire estate
was left to Micheal Debella, a Chicago policeman.
Edwin Atwood died in 1969. His estate, estimated at
ten million dollars, was left to Mrs. Helen Pinnell
(Harding Files 1980).
LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY HISTORY AFTER
RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION FROM '1904
The introduction of railroads into the Lower Rio
Grande Valley was the pivotal factor in changing the
region from a sparsely populated ranching area to a populous
center of agriculture. The construction of the St. Louis,
Brownsville and Mexico (SLB&M) Railroad in 1904 began the
process of transition and was followed by a number of other
privately financed rail lines. Eventually, all these companies
were incorporated into the Missouri Pacific and the
Southern Pacific railroad systems; however, it was their
initiative which precipitated the Valley's economic revolution at the turn of the century.
The perceived economic gains from t'he "Magic Valley
of the Rio Grande" provided the final stimu1us to out-ofstate investment which completed the financing of the St.
Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railroad. Various irrigation
projects in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, including George
Brulay's sugar cane plantation below Brownsville in 1876
and John Closner's irrigation experiments with sugar cane
near Hidalgo in 1895, demonstrated the economic possibilities
to investors (Matthews 1938: 55-57; Valley By-Liners 1975:
79-88).
Land and irrigation companies began forming in
1904 for the purpose of developing large tracts of land
throughout the Valley. Commercial enterprises had to be
dramatically expanded to utilize the new rail system and
to keep it operating at a profitable level.

DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES
The first emphasis was directed toward properties
adjacent to the railroad iteself. Raymondville was developed
by E.B. Raymond, organizer of the Raymond Town and Improvement
Company in 1904. Harlingen was laid out by Lon C. Hill for
the Lon C. Hill Town Improvement Company in 1904. Mercedes was
organized and promoted by the American Rio Grande Land and
Irrigation Company in 1904. Examples of other developers include
W.E. Stewart of the W.E. Stewart Land Company (Weslaco); C.H.
Swallow of the Alamo Land and Sugar Company (Alamo); John Shary
of the Southwestern Land Company (Sharyland); J.C. Engleman
of Engleman Gardens (northeast of Edinburg); Will Harding
and Lamar Gill of Harding-Gill Company (Willamar, Lasara,
Hargill) and Delta Orchard Company; and John C. Kelley and
H.N. Pharr of the Louisiana Rio Grande Canal Company (Pharr)
(Harding Files 1980).
The development companies radically changed the
face of the lower Rio Grande Valley. Thousands of salesmen and promoters brought prospective buyers from allover the
United States to see the possibilities of agriculture in
the Valley. The thousands of palm trees which now line
the highways were for the most part planted by the various
development companies. The swaying palms and orderly
arrangement were intended to suggest a tropical paradise
that was verdant, fertile and warm (Harding 1980).
There was a year-round growing season with infrequent cropdamaging cold snaps. The arid climate and low annual rainfall were tempered by the vast irrigation systems.
The current project area cuts through three areas
developed by the Harding-Gill Company and/or the Delta
Orchard Company and Southwestern Land Co~pany. Figure
18 shows the locations of these extensive:,projects.
The Harding-Gill Company was formed in 1916
between William A. Harding, born in Minnesota, and S. Lamar
Gill, born in Live Oak County, Texas. Both men were
very active in the growth of Raymondville and Willacy County.
W.A. Harding was a County Commissioner of Willacy County,
served on the Board of Directors of the Willacy County W~ter
Control and Irrigation District No.1, and organized the
Delta Orchard Company. S.L. Gill was Raymondville's first
mayor in 1912, served as County Judge (known tnereafter
as Judge Gill), set up his own law practice in Raymondvile,
105

and helped organize the Raymondville State Bank .(Vllley.

The stated purpose of the Harding-Gill Company was
to promote the development of Willacy County. Their business association under that name continued until 1927,
and within that time the company cleared over 50,000 acres
of land in the San Juan de Carricitos Grant east of Raymondville and in the Mestinas Tract west of Raymondville.
They developed six new townsites, Lasara, Hargill, Rollo,
Willamar, San Perlita (previously Rancho Santa Margarita)
and Santa Monica. Their activities were so intensive that
in 1925, J. C. Montgomery, writing in Monty's Monthly,
descri bes 1,500 Mexi can I aborers as worki ng to cl ear the
brush in the Mestinas Tract with another 4,000-5 ;000 men
needed to complete the work on the 10,000 acres for
cotton planting. A letter was sent to postmasters in
Southwest Texas with instructions to direct all unemployed
laborers to the Harding-Gill headquarters in Raymondville
where they could join the army already at work (Montgomery
1925). Mechanical equipment has since replaced this laborintensive type of work.
W. A. Harding was influential in establishing rail
service between Raymondville and Edinburg on the Missouri
Pacific Railroad. Tracks were laid in 1927 to serve Lasara,
Hargill and Rollo (now Monte Alto). In 1929 Harding chartered the Delta Orchard Company to subdivide and develop
50,000 acres of the Mestinas Tract for orchards. The company constructed a clubhouse near Delta Lake (reservoir for
the Wi llacy County Control and Irrigation District No.1)
where they entertained large parties of prospective out-ofstate buyers who were brought in on special trains. Land
was sold in 40-, 60- or 80-acre lots depending upon the
amount of investment the purchaser desired to make. A care
contract ran for three years and financing was insured.
During the Depression, Harding was forced
sell some
of his land in Delta Orchards which later, in 1941, became
Rio Farms (Harding Files 1980).

Another of Harding's properties was Evergreen Farms
on FM 1925 northeast of Edinburg. Here he farmed alfalfa
and oats. These crops, and periwinkles from another
farm, were dehydrated for commercial use. The periwinkles
were used in the treatment of cancer (Harding 1980).
The far western section of the present project area
was subdivided and promoted by John Shary of the Southwestern Land Company. He was born in Nebraska and graduated

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

from Doane College in Crete, Nebraska. Shary began his
business career as a druggist. He came to Texas as a
salesman for a California drug company and became interested in real estate development around Corpus Christi
(Vall e y - By - Lin e r s 1978 : 189) . He and his par t ne r, Ge 0 r ge
A. Paul, sold 250,000 acres in the Sinton, Teft, Robstown
and Corpus Christi area for cotton farming between 1906 and
1910. Shary set up land sales offices in Omaha, St. Louis
and Chicago to bring in prospective buyers on special
trains to various clubhouses. He continued this method
of promotion for acreage around San Juan, Pharr, McAllen,
Mission and Shary1and. He was president of United Irrigation Company and organized the Texas Citrus Fruit Growers
Exchange.
In 1914 John Sharj began his citrus development
business, Shary1and. Located north of Mission, Shary1and
included property from Monte Christo to Mission.
It was
one of the largest and most successful developments of its
type in the Valley (Val1ey-By-Liners 1978: 188-193).
The "Shary Plan" was designed to provide the small
investor with a complete citrus production program capable
of a profitable return on investment. The program included
irrigation service, trees from Shary1and nurseries, yearround grove care, and marketing of the produce. Shary
visited California to inspect the citrus packing firms
and then built his own at Shary1and (Va11ey-By-Liners
1978: 117-123).
In 1930 Shary Products Company was organized to utilize culls and citrus by-products into canned
juices, stock feeds and molasses (Bureau of Research and
Publicity 1937: 391; Va11ey-By-Liners 1978: 188-193).
RAILROADS
Prior to the construction of the St". Louis, Brownsville and Mexico (SLB&M) Railroad in 1904, ~umerous attempts
had been made to organize companies and charters to connect
Brownsville with the rest of the state by rail.
In 1850
Felix Mason, Pat C. Shannon and Richard Fitzpatrick received
authority from the Texas Legislature to incorporate the Rio
Grande Railway and Turnpike Company. They proposed to
construct a railroad between the Colorado River and the
mouth of the Rio Grande with options to extend service
along the Rio Grande River to E1 Paso. Construction never
commenced on this project (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1954: 161).
Another attempt was made in 1853 by thirteen incorporators
to extend rail service from some point on the Laguna Madre
to the Rio Grande via E1 Sal de Rey. Once again, construction never began (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1954: 162).

HISTORY AFTER RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION

In 1871 the first railroad in the Valley, the Rio
Grande Railway, was completed between Port Isabel and Brownsville. It was a project planned by Mifflin Kenedy, Richard
King, Stephen Powers and several other businessmen. A narrow
gauge road, it was surveyed and constructed along a straight
line with no modifications for changes in terrain; consequently, the tracks were often submerged following floods and
hurricanes. After passing through several ownerships, the
road was relocated and adapted to standard gauge in 1922
(Stambau9h and Stambaugh 1954: 162-163).
In 1863 Richard King sponsored a rail line from
Corpus Christi to Brownsville, the Corpus Christi and
Rio Grande Railroad; however, it proved to be unsuccessful. Count Joseph Telf~ner proposed a simila~ project
in 1881 but only completed a line from Rosenberg to
Victoria (Allhands 1949: 73-74; Lea 1957: 537). Packaging a railroad deal became more difficult in 1882 when
a major financing incentive was removed. The State Land
Grant Law was repealed by the Texas Legislature; this
action eliminated direct land bonuses to railroad companies
for construction within the state.
It was left to individual landowners to offer this type of incentive to
finance railroad construction (Allhands 1931: 35).
In 1889 Colonel E.H. Ropes, a newspaperman and
real estate promoter from New York City, proposed to
dredge a channel across Mustang Island to establish
Corpus Christi as a port and to build a railroad south
to Brownsville, Central America and Panama. By 1890
the channel was begun and 25 miles of railroad grade
were completed, but the ambitious proposition collapsed
from the overextension of its financial base (Allhands
1949: 76; Lea 1957: 537).
Two projects were proposed from V~ctoria to the
Rio Grande.
In 1894 the Pan American Rail~ay was due
to run from Victoria to the Rio Grande; however, the
project failed and all materials were sold by the
sheriff (Lea 1957: 537). In 1897 Uriah Lott and thirteen Victoria residents formed the Guadalupe Valley
Railway Corporation which proposed to link Victoria
with Houston and Galveston as well as to extend rail
south to the common corner of Cameron and Hidalgo
counties, a distance of approximately 300 miles. A
sufficient amount of working capital could not be raised
from the Victoria area so this project also failed
(Allhands 1949: 75).
109

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

•

These numerous proposals and failures raised
expectations among Valley residents many times but did
not succeed in extending rail service into Brownsville .
Major John B. Armstrong, accompanied by several ranchers
and landowners, formed a committee in 1893 to personally
visit the Southern Pacific offices in San Antonio. They
wanted to discuss proposals, plans and incentives for an
ex te ns ion 0 f the r ail r 0 adin to Sou t h Te xas, and the y had
the full support of several other Valley ranchers including
Henrietta King and Mifflin Kenedy. The committee submitted
a written proposal which the Southern Pacific representative with whom they were in contact, M.D. Monserrate,
pledged to present to the railroad board of directors for
consideration; however, no reply was ever received
(All hands 1931: 39-40; Le~ 1957: 538).
The Southern Pacific's lack of action aroused a
great deal of adverse feelings toward the company among
Valley residents. The expansion of commercial markets
for products harvested from newly irrigated lands was being
retarded because of the lack of dependable transportation.
The extensive large-scale irrigation and development
already in the planning stages could not be fully realized
until railroads serviced the area. Ranchers also encountered
difficulties in transporting their stock to market;
cattle had to be driven on the hoof to the Rio Grande or to
Alice for shipment to northern markets. Many residents
felt that the Southern Pacific considered the Rio Grande
Valley as its own territory to be developed when the profit
motive and risk factors were most advantageous (Allhands
1931: 38; Lea 1957: 538-539).
As the Valley waited for railroad transportation
connections, the differences between the Lower Rio Grande
area and the rest of the state rapidly increased. Excepting stagecoach, ship traffic and telegraph ;.the Valley was
essenti ally cut off from communi cat ion, serv'i ces , transport and trade that the rest of Texas already enjoyed.
They were, of economic necessity, more closely connected
to Mexico than to the United States; the common language
was Spanish and the currency was the Mexican peso (Allhands
1931: 32). An example of this isolation is illustrated
by a telegram dated July 4, 1904 (after the arrival of
the railroad), from the Business League of Brownsville
to B.G. Yoakum, an SLB&M Railroad official. The City
Council pledged to adopt Standard Time to replace Sun
Time in honor of the new connection with the outside world.
The rest of the United States changed to Standard Time on
November 18, 1883, when the four time zones in use today
were adopted (Allhands 1960: 65-66).

HISTORY AFTER RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION

Uriah Lott was involved with several of the proposed
railroad schemes into the Rio Grande Valley. He had some
successes and some failures credited to his enterprises all
over the state. The Corpus Christi, San Diego and Rio Grande
Narrow Gauge Railroad (later the Tex-Mex) was completed
in 1881 between Corpus Christi and Laredo(Allhands 1949:
18-22). The San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad (SA&AP)
was completed between San Antonio and Corpus Christi in
1886. Lott's road from Victoria to the Valley, as noted
previously, was not successful. He was known throughout the
railroad industry for his ability to construct roads on a
small amount of initial capital and a great amount of
enthusi asm and promi se (A llhands' 1960: 28-29).
In 1ate 1902 Uri ah Lott approached hi s', good fri end
and the previous vice-president of the SA&AP Railroad,
B.F. Yoakum, concerning assistance in the promotion of
the Valley Railroad. Lott had already secured a land
bonus of more than 100,000 acres, free ri ght-of-way and
terminal grounds, and at least $75,000 in cash (Allhands
1960: 48).
Together, Lott and Yoakum continued to assemble the
necessary land and capital to promote construction of a
railroad to the Rio Grande Valley. As a result of their
efforts, they secured the backi ng of many ranchers and
landowners. On January 12, 1903, the state issued a
charter to the SL8&M Railroad to construct, operate and
maintain a railroad line from Sinton to Brownsville, a
distance of some 160 miles (Lea 1957: 541). The incorporators were listed as Robert J. Kleberg, A.E. Spohn, Robert
Driscoll, Sr., Uriah Lott, Richard King II, John G. Kenedy,
James B. Wells, Francisco Yturria, Thomas Carson, Robert
Driscoll, Jr., E.H. Caldwell, George F. Evans, Caesar
Kleberg, John B. Armstrong, and John J. Welder. Uriah
Lott served as president, Robert J. Kleb~rg as vicepresident and secretary, and John G. Ken~dy as secretary
(Lea 1957: 541).
The contract, pending final land bonus quantities
and financing, was let to Johnson Brothers of St. Elmo,
Illinois .. B.F. and P.M. Johnson were well known railroad
contractors who had participated in operations in Oklahoma
and throughout the north (Allhands 1960: 50-51).

111

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

As soon as the news of the Lott Railroad was
announced, the Southern Pacific began plans to construct
a parallel road from Alice, Texas, southward. Their offer
to Valley residents required no land bonuses. After years
of no rail service, the Lower Rio Grande Valley had two
competing lines vying for its business; however, both
enterprises experienced difficulties during the promotion
and construction phases of their projects (Allhands 1931:
36) .
Support for Uriah Lott's railroad was necessarily
derived from both large and small ranchers. A great deal
of the land from Sinton to a point 75 miles north of
Brownsville was owned by Henrietta King, Robert Driscoll,
John G. Kenedy, and John B.· Armstrong. All of these landowners donated land to right-of-way and to contractors'
bonuses which constituted part of the "down-payment" from
local residents (Lea 1957: 542). Gathering the required
land and cash from the Brownsville area was more difficult.
The Brownsvine Herald editor, Jessi eO. Wheel er, was a
strong supporter of the line and wrote numerOUS editorials
encouraging all landowners to consider Lott's venture.
He denounced the Southern Pacific and reminded residents
of promises never fulfilled. Lon C. Hill, the founder of
Harlingen and other Valley towns, also promoted the SLB&~1
Railroad. He and a local committee of approximately forty
businessmen secured the required land, terminal grounds
and cash for the 1ast 75 mi 1es (All hands 1931: 38-39).
On July 1, 1903, the railway company signed the construction contract with Johnson Brothers and work began (Lea
1957: 543).
The Southern Pacific was also having troubles
getting its road organized. The Texas Railroad Commission
and the Attorney General's Office brought legal action
against them and threatened to cancel their-charter for
irregularities in the issuance of bonds and in the purchase
of "parallel and competing lines" (Allhands 1931: 36-37);
1960: 50). Work on their extension from Alice began
several months late and was halted at Falfurrias for a
time. In October 1927 it finally reached Brownsville
through Harlingen. (Allhands 1931: 42-43).
The most serious obstacle in the construction of
the SLB&M Railroad was a yellow fever epidemic which
started in Monterrey and spread along the Tex-Mex railroad. Brownsville was quarantined against the Mexican
112

•

•

HISTORY AFTER RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION

border and shipments of construction materials were very
difficult to obtain.
It became necessary to obtain
quarantine permits to move engineering parties and supplies
into and out of Brownsville. The fever was finally stamped
out and work on the road continued (Allhands 1931: 51-52).
On July 4, 1904, the first passenger train left
Corpus Christi for Brownsville less than one year after
the commencement of construction. The scheduled travelin9 time for passengers was ten hours compared to forty
hours on the stagecoach from Alice (Allhands 1931: 5152) .
The western extension of the SLB&M Railroad was
known as the Sam Fordyce Branch which ran due ~est from
Brownsville to Sam Fordyce. As was the case in Brownsville, raising the required land bonus, right-of-way and
terminal grounds was difficult. Plans for construction
were indefinitely postponed until John Closner, Lon C.
Hill and Tom Hicks guaranteed the agreement. The westward extension was rerouted in January 1905 due to floods
on the Rio Grande near Sam Fordyce (Allhands 1931: 119,131).
That station remained the terminus of the line until 1925
when a 22-mile extension linked Rio Grande City with
Brownsville; this project was completed by the Rio Grande
City Railway Company.
It was delayed so long due to
border problems from 1913 through 1917 and due to insufficient capital to finance the project (All hands 1931: 140).
In 1908 a railroad extension was constructed north
from San Juan to the townsite of Chapin which later became
the county seat of Edinburg (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1954:
177). This was a project of Sam Robertson and the San
Antonio and Rio Grande Railway. By 1912 the line was
brought out by the SLB&M and continued to operate within
that system (All hands 1960: 196-197).
Sam Robertson also conceived the idea of a "Spider
Web" railroad connecting Valley towns by a network of
spurs and branches. There were no farm-to-market roads
to facilitate shipment of produce crops; this situation
decreased the desirability of the land and hurt land
sales. The San Benito and Rio Grande Valley Interurban.
Railway Company was incorporated in 1912 to construct
and operate this system. A 2-mile section was com113

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

pleted in Brownsville around 1912,22 miles between
Monte Christo and Sammon~ (2 miles south of
Mission) in 1911, and 31.2 miles between Sammons and
Santa Maria alon9 the Rio Grande in 1926 (Stambaugh
and Stambaugh 1954: 178).
The SLB&M underwent several changes after 1910.
The syndicate promoters sold their interest during that
year and eventually the property went bankrupt and into
receivership (Allhands 1960: 195). The transformation
of the Rio Grande Valley began with the construction of
the SLB&M but industry and commerce could not develop
quickly enough to keep the railroad solvent. Ironically,
the bandit raids from 1915 to 1917 necessitated military
intervention, which brought trainloads of troops, equipment and supplies over,the rails. It was affer World
War I, however, before the SLB&M was operatin9 profitably
(Allhands 1960: 195).
Many spurs and branches were built throu9hout the
Rio Grande Valley (Fi9. 19). The later construction of a
grid pattern of highways and roads eliminated the need
for many feeder railroads, and the inactive track was
taken up or abandoned. The independent lines were taken
over by either the Missouri Pacific or the Southern Pacific
lines.
BANDITS
The growth and prosperity of the Lower Rio Grande
Valley after the turn of the century was inhibited by the
bandit raids from 1913 to 1917. Groups of armed men on
horseback crossed the Rio Grande to raid farms, ranches
and businesses. The political situation in Mexico during
this time was in such turmoil that only a few details
pertainin9 to this discussion will be apdressed. Frank
C. Pierce, a noted Valley historian, poi,nted out that
between the years 1911 and 1915 there were nine presidents
of Mexico, one of whom ruled only 28 minutes (Pierce 1962:
74-75).
Three factions within the Mexican 90vernment were
most often associated with the bandit raids. The
Carranzistas were followers of General Venustiano Carrqnza,
former governor of the State of Coahuila, who sponsored
a revolt in Mexico during early 1913. His 90vernment was
not recognized by the United States until 1915. The
•

______~H~I~S~T~ORY AFTER RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION

Villistas were followers of Pancho Villa, a one-time
general of Carranza, who led a revolt against his former
leader. Villa was most active along the upper Rio Grande
near Chihuahua, but his troops made raids further south,
especially after the United States' recognition of Carranza
and the subsequent embargo of all arms to Mexico (Stambaugh
and Stambaugh 1956: 210-211; Lea 1957: 589-592). The
Hueristas were followers of General Victoriano Huerto who
was deposed by Carranza (Harris and Sadler 1978: 382).

The situation in the Lower Rio Grande Valley
became volatile when Tom Mayfield, deputy sheriff of
Hidalgo County, arrested Basilio Ramos in early 1915 and
exposed the "San Diego Plot" (Valley By-Liners 1978: 124126). This scheme was supposedly formulated tn Mexico to
stimulate political turmoil on the Texas border until the
Carranza government was formally recognized by the United
Stat e s (H a r r i san d Sad 1e r 1978: 382 ) . The p1an call e d for
a revolution of Mexicans on both sides of the border to
liberate Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and California for formation into an independent republic which
was to be annexed by Mexico at a later time(Lea 1957:
581-582).
In the aftermath of the discovery of the plot,
threats to property and persons continued throu9hout the
Valley. A list of some of the events which occurred within
a three-month period during the disturbances is enumerated below:

to be lower than the actual figures due to the dispersed
settlements throughout the ranch country and the dificulty of travel from one place to another. Cameron, Starr
and Webb counties were grouped together in 1850. By 1860
Hidalgo County was created and was independent of Cameron
County. Willacy County was created in 1911, and this change
is reflected in the 1920 Census; however, it was reorganized
in 1921 when the northern section of the county was deleted
to form Kenedy County and additional sections of Cameron
and Hidalgo counties were added. The 1970 Census used a
different system for dividing the counties into districts;
therefore, the population for the towns is not based upon
the same area as in previous years.
In spite of the, above inconsistencies ~f population counts, Table 8 shows the rapid in-migration and
population increases which occurred between 1900 and 1940.
In order to create a shipping market for the SLB&M, its
promoters and financers became heavily involved with land
development. New towns mushroomed out of the cactus
and brush along the railroad, and land development companies purchased acreage, built irrigatibn systems to
increase productivity, and brought in prospective buyers
from allover the country.
The ballooning rate of population increase in
Willacy and Hidalgo counties resulting from the agricultural developments slowed sharply by 1960. In 1970
Willacy County had a 22 percent decrease in population
from the previous decade, and Hidalgo County had a mere
.348 percent increase.

INTRODUCTION
In their assessment of the cultural resources of
Hidalgo and Willacy counties, Mallouf, Baskin and Killen
(1977) divided the area into seven environmental zones .
These zones, which were based on a wide variety of
available geologic, topographic, vegetative and faunal
data, attempted to take into account both the modern
and the prehistoric environments. The environmental
zones, together with land-use patterns, are essential to
deriving the current interpretation of the environments
along the proposed drainage improvement project. Four of
the seven environmental zones defined by Mallouf, Baskin
and Ki 11 en (Zones I, I I, IV, and VI), were encountered
during the present survey. Zones III, V, and VII will
not be affected by the proposed construction. This portion of the current study will describe the pa5t and
present envi ronments of. the area.
.
In Hidalgo and Willacy counties the land development of the twentieth century has had a most profound
effect on the environment. Not only have the flora and
fauna been altered by settlement and agricultural practices,
but the topography has been altered by leveling, irrigation,
flooding and drainage practices. Environmental Zones I,
II and IV have undergone the most extensive alterations
to the natural environment and many of the native species
of flora and fauna have been extirpated from these areas.
Environmental Zone VI retains a much higher portion of
native species.
GEOLOGIC BACKGROUND
The South Texas coastal region is a geologic complex of Pleistocene and Holocene fluvial and deltaic
sediments composed of sands and muds (Brown et al 1980).
There are no natural rock or gravel outcrops in Willacy
and much of central and eastern Hidalgo counties; gravel
deposits were observed, however, at the western end of
the survey area in southwestern Hidalgo County.
During the Pleistocene and early Holocene, the
large Rio Grande Delta was prograding from the northwest
toward the sea in several lobes (Brown et al 1980). The'
sands of Padre Island represent the leading edge of the
Pleistocene delta which is being rolled back and eroded.
The extensive clay dunes of eastern Willacy County are
the remains of thick, interlobate areas of the delta,
143

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

while further inland the distributary channels of the
delta have left a maze of abandoned sandy meander belts
and areas of overbank mud. The Laguna Madre began to
form around 3,400 B.P. and has since transgressed landward
forming the salt marshes (Brown et al 1980). Eolian processes began eroding the soft sands and clays to form
dune field and deflation areas. The mapped distribution
of relict deltaic, fluvial and eolian features gives
expression to the topographic and soil types developed
over abandoned channels and dunes (Brown et al 1980).
Eastern Willacy County, affected by coastal
processes associated with the Laguna Madre, has an
essentially flat topography. Toward the central part
of the county the topography changes from flat to;undulating with relief providea by low sandy hummocks and
eolian depressions (Mallouf, Baskin and Killen 1977).
These meander-belt sands become less abundant approaching
the Willacy-Hidalgo county line. Eastern and central
Hidalgo County have extensive longitudinal sand sheets
with a southeastern drift which form a thin veneer overlying deltaic muds and silts (Brown et al 1980). The
sandy-loamy soils developed on these dune fields are
highly conducive to agriculture and the dunes have been
extensively leveled and cut by irrigation canals (Mallouf,
Baskin and Killen 1977). In the western part of Hidalgo
County there is a small area of conical dunes and eolian
depressions which are poorly stabilized by vegetation
while the southwestern part of the county is covered by
narrow sand ridges alternating with muds and silts. Prevailing winds are from the southeast and have resulted in
the formation of long narrow dune trains (Brown et al
1980). The Faysville, Edinburg and Rio Hondo stabilized
dune fields document the increasing aridity of the late
Holocene. This area has been subjected to extensive
alteration by deep plowing and land-levelin~, and
frequently the prehistoric depressions in th~ original
topography are difficult to recognize.

•

HISTORIC VIEW
Although the soils of Hidalgo and Willacy counties
have proved to be highly productive in the twentieth century, their value was not recognized earlier due to the
absence of natural streams and a low level of annual precipitations. Early explorers considered the area to be a
144

•

FLORAL HISTORY

desert marked by dense brush in central and northern Willacy
County (Inglis 1964). Several nineteenth century explorers
traversed north and south across Willacy County and recorded
impressions of the vegetation. The earliest data were
reported by Bonnell, who surveyed the area of Willacy County
in 1840 and noted the salt lake (La Sal Vieja) in the northwestern corner. Kirby-Smith crossed the area in 1846 and
described it as prairie and plains, while in 1863 Freemantle
described the area as "a dead level of sand, mesquite trees
and prickly pears" (Inglis 1964: 79). Vernon Bailey, a trained
naturalist, crossed the area of Willacy County in 1889. He
noted the live oakmotts in the northern part and described
a dense vegetation of mesquite, cactus chaparral with huisache,
yuccas and Parkinsonia becoming common farther. south. None
of the nineteenth century explorers crossed the area which
became Hidalgo County (Inglis 1964).
The coming of the railroad in 1904 produced a·
dramatic change in the marketability of agricultural products. With the introduction of irrigation, Hidalgo and
Willacy counties rapidly lost their desertlike vegetative
character. Native vegetation has largely been extirpated
from most of Hidalgo County and westernWillacy County.
FLORAL HISTORY
Studies of the vegetative and biotic communities
of Texas undertaken since the late 1940's define the character of the south Texas region. Blair (1950) established
biotic provinces for Texas based on earlier work by Dice
(1943). The south Texas region, including Willacy and
Hidalgo counties, was defined as the Tamaulipan biotic province on the basis of natural boundaries·of floral and
faunal distributions. The arid-tropical~limate of the
Tamaulipan province is unique in Texas in that there are
endemic species of flora and fauna which are found only in
northern Mexico and the south tip of Texas. Blair (1950)
defines the native vegetation of the region as predominantly
thorny brush composed of retama (Parkinsonia aculeata) ,
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) , anacahuita (Cordia boissieri),
prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri) , yucca (Yucca elata)
and coastal marshes dominated by sacahuiste (Spartina
spartinae).

145

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

Correll and Johnston (1970) place Hidalgo and
Willacy counties in the region of Texas which they term
Gulf Prairies and Marshes. The Gulf Prairies and Marshes
encompass a region of poorly drained soils, predominantly
acid sands, sandy loams and clays, which rest on Pleistocene and Holocene deltaic complexes. Hidalgo and
Willacy counties, with their lack of natural drainage
and frequent flooding, fit well within this category. The
climax vegetation of the Gulf Prairies was largely grassland as noted by Bonnell and Kirby-Smith in the nineteenth
century (Correll and Johnston 1970; In9lis 1964), with
marshes dominated by salt-tolerant plants such as sac ahuiste (Spartina spartinae), saltgrass (Distich lis
spicata), pusley and moss rose (Portulaca spp.) (Correll
and Johnston 1970).
.
During the nineteenth century and continuing into
the twentieth century the area has been invaded by brush
and trees including mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), oak
(Quercus spp.) and prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri)
(Correll and Johnston 1970). Since 1900 a large number
of introduced grasses and weed species have replaced
much of the native vegetation. Common introduced species
include johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), bermudagrass
(Cynodon dactylon), buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris),
broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus) and Yankee weed
(Eupatorium compositifolium) (Correll and Johnston 1970).
FAUNAL BACKGROUND
The fauna of the region is composed of two
elements: animals indigenous to the entire state and a
smaller, more unique, component formed by Neotropical
species (Blair 1950). Widespread species common throughout Texas include coyote (Canis latrans), wh,ite-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus)
and smaller common rodents (Burt and Grossenheider 1964).
The Neotropical species endemic to the Tamaulipan province
are mainly smaller mammals, reptiles, amphibians and
birds. Two mammal species, the Mexican pocket mouse
(Liomys irroratus) and the Jaguarundi cat (Felis
yagouaroundi) and several reptilian species including the
Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri), reticulate collared
146

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE SURVEY BY ZONE

lizard (Crotaphytus retioulatus) , keeled earless lizard
(Holbrookia propinqua), three species of spiny lizard
(Saeloporus spp.), Indigo snake (Drymarohon oorais),
giant toad (Bufo marinus) , white-lipped frog (Leptodaotylus
labialis) and Rio Grande frog (Syrrhophus oystignathoides)
are restricted to the Tamaulipan biotic province (Blair 1950).
Bird populations are high in south Texas and include
numerous sea and marsh birds along the coastal area. Several
unique Mexican emmigrants include chachalaca (Ortalis vetula),
white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatioa), Kiskadee Flycatcher
(Pitangus sulphuratus), yellow-green Vireo (Vireo
flavoviridus), Lichtenstein's Oriole (Ioterus gularis),
Greenjay (Cyanooorax ynoas), buff-bellied hummingbird
(Amazilia yuoatanensis); groove-billed Ani (Crotophaga
suloirostris) and Mexican crow (Corvus imparatus) (Bull
and Farrand 1977). These Neotropical species of birds
are not found elsewhere in the United States but range south
into Mexico and Central America (Blair 1950).
The native birds, reptiles, amphibians and smaller
mammals all reflect the Mexican origin of the south Texas
fauna. This Neotropical element is restricted mainly by
mean annual temperatures; however, man has been the limiting
factor for such species as the Jaguarundi (Felis yagouaroundi) ,
ocelot (Felis pardalis) and Jaguar (Felis onoa) which once
ranged more widely fn-south Texas (Blaii 1950).
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE SURVEY BY ZONE
The proposed channelization forms a bifurcating
network of waterways through Environmental Zones I, II,
IV, VI, VIII and IX. The latter two zones were defined
during the laboratory analysis of this pruject; consequently, no observatons were specifically made for Zones
VIII and IX during the field work. The following discussions
are limited to the four zones (I, II, IV and VI) which were
examined during the course of the field investigations.
The same general floral and faunal communities described
for the other zones should be present in the two additional
zones; the primary reasons for the identification of these
147

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

two zones rest within the general depositional history and
modern land use as indicated in Part I of this report.
ENVIRONMENTAL ZONE I
Environmental Zone I is restricted to southern
Hidalgo County. Geologically the area is part of the
Hargill Conical Dune Field and the Lasara Loess Plain
(Brown et al 1980). The dunes, whose soils are a mixture
of sand, silt and mud, are stabilized by vegetation
although wind still effects erosion in the associated
deflation areas. Much of the area has undergone land
leveling and deep plowing (Mallouf, Baskin and Killen
1977), and no natural streams occur (Brown et al 1980).
The area is predominantly irrigated cropland with, citrus
trees occurring as the do~inant vegetation althrough some
native vegetation exists along dune crests; this includes
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), Texas ebony (Pithecellobium flexicaule) and prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri).
Grasses and weeds along ditches and fields
are mainly introduced and pioneer species such as
buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris), johnsongrass (Sorghum
halepense), milkweed (Asclepias brachystephana), goat
head (Tribulus terrestris) and old man's beard (Clematis
drummondii) .

Destruction of the natural habitat has been
almost complete in this intensively cultivated area.
Those species of native thorny brush and herbacious
vegetation which have managed to maintain themselves
are listed in Table 9. The larger species of animals
have been either eliminated or dispersed into areas
of more natural brushland north of Environmental Zone I.
Several species of small rodents, rabbits,'
amphibians and reptiles are still indigenous to the
area (Table 10), and the total eliminationdf these
faunal elements would be unwise since they contribute
to the destruction of many flying and burrowing insect
pests. Spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus couchi), horny toads
(Phrynosoma cornutum), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo valliceps),
several species of fence lizard (Cnemidorphorus spp.),
and spiny lizards (Sceloporus spp.) are particularly
good insect-eaters. The spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus
couchi) was extremely common in the project area during

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

the survey due to recent rains which brought the toad out
of estivation. Breeding and development of the young is
restricted to the rainy season and is very rapid. Environmental Zone I is inland and thus contains few sea birds,
but species of ground and flocking birds such as doves,
grackles, blackbirds and barn swallow are numerous. Common
bird species found in Zone I are listed in Table 11.
ENVIRONMENTAL ZONE II
Environmental Zone II in many aspects is similar
to Environmental Zone I, but there is greater variation
in the topography which changes from flat in western
Willacy County to undulating in Hidalgo County. The eastern
part of Zone II is underlain by fluvial and deltaic muds
and silts with a thin cover of sand (Brown et aZ 1980). Low
sand hummocks and eolian depressions in the east, and conical
dunes in the west, reflect the strong eolian impact on these
abandoned fluvial and deltaic land sediments (Brown et aZ
1980). There are no streams or natural drainages in Zone
II (Mallouf, Baskin and Killen 1977). No natural rock outcrops occur in the zone, but this survey found evidence
of gravel deposits in the western part of Hidalgo County.
The irrigated cropland of Environmental Zone II,
located in the central and western areas of Hidalgo County,
is a smaller percentage of the total acreage than it is for
Zone I; if the amount in dry cropland is included, however,
the percentages are equal. Many of the fallow areas and
the banks of irrigation canals have been seeded with
buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciZiaris) to reduce erosion and moisture loss. Mesquite (Prosopis gZanduZosa), Texas honeylocust (GZeditsia texana) and anacahuita (Cordia boissieri)
are the common native trees. Along the roads, Royal Palms
and Date Palms were planted by land developers after 1900
(see Part III, Appendix I, Historical Background). A portion of the area (12%), mainly in western Willacy County,
is rangeland which maintains the native vegetation of
thorny brush and grasses (Mallouf, Baskin and Killen 1977).
Many range areas, however, have been seeded with introduced bunch grass species such as buffelgrass (Cenchrus
ciZiaris).
Table 9 lists the common vegetation of the
rangeland and natural area of dry cropland as well as the
pioneering species found in the irrigated croplands.

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE SURVEY BY ZONE

The faunal component changes somewhat across Environmental Zone II inasmuch as the dry cropland and
rangeland support some larger mammalian species, including
deer (OdocoiZeus virginianus) , raccoon (Procyon Zotor)
and coyote (Canis Zatrans). The smaller mammals, reptiles
and amphibians common throughout the zone are listed in
Table 10. In the rangeland, species of hawk and vulture
become more common and reflect the increase in smaller
animals and greater carrion opportunities. Small ponds
in Environmental Zone II contain large numbers of marsh
and wading birds. Table 11 lists the bird species found
in the area.
ENVIRONMENTAL ZONE IV
Environmental 'Zone IV is the largest in the survey area and encompasses much of Willacy County. Geologically the area is composed of a complex of fluvial and
deltaic lobes of late Pleistocene age (Brown et aZ 1980).
The surface topography ranges from flat to undulating with
sand hummocks and eolian depressions; elevations range
from 10 feet (3 meters) above MSL to 40-50 feet (12-15
meters) above MSL in the western section (Mallouf, Baskin
and Killen 1977). The soils are composed of meander-belt
sands, overbank muds and silts (Brown et aZ 1980). The
only natural stream in the entire survey area, the Arroyo
Colorado, crosses the southern part of Environmental Zone
IV; however, the zone as a whole has the same poor drainage
as the surrounding area. Agricultural practices have caused
the natural water table to rise because of the use of
irrigation canals (Mallouf, Baskin and Killen 1977). Flood
damage is considerable, particularly following tropical
storms and hurricanes.
Irrigated cropland covers approximately 40 percent of the area with dry cropland claiming another 24 percent (Mallouf, Baskin and Killen 1977). Land leveling and
deep plowing, along with the destruction of natural vegetation, have altered the original topography of the area.
In
the eastern area, the rangeland, although overgrazed, retains
much of the character of the native vegetation. Overgrazing,

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

thorny brush is apparently the natural chaparral reported
by early explorers. In order to improve forage, the rangeland has been seeded with several species of grasses, including buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciZiaris), bermudagrass
(Cynodon dactyZon) and native seacoast bluestem (Andropogon
scroparius) (Correll and Johnston 1970). Overgrazed areas
are also commonly invaded by an introduced herbaceous plant,
Yankee weed (Eupatorium compositifoZium) which grows well
in defoliated areas. Table 12 lists the native and introduced plant species common to Environment Zone IV.
The irrigated and dry cropland areas retain native
plant species in the form of pioneering weeds and grasses
which cover spoil banks along irrigation canals, roadside
ditches and field margins. Mesquite (Prosopis gZanduZosa) ,
Texas honeylocust (GZeditsia texana) and prickly pear
(Opuntia Zindheimeri) are found in these uncultivated areas.
The live oak motts described by Baily in 1889 (Inglis 1964)
are still present and are scattered across the northern
part of Zone IV (Blair 1950).
The faunal component of Environmental Zone IV shows
an increase in the number of both species and individuals
from west to east. The western, or irrigated cropland,
area is restricted to small mammals, amphibians, reptiles
and inland birds. The dry cropland and rangeland have more
species of larger mammals such as deer (rOdocoiZeus
virginianus) , armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) and coyote
(Canis Zatrans). The faunal component of Zone IV is
summarized in Table 10. Smaller bird species such as
warblers and doves and an occasional turkey are more common
in the thorny brush (Bull and Farrand 1977) and are
summarized in Table 11.
ENVIRONMENTAL ZONE VI
Environmental Zone VI in eastern Willacy County
differs greatly from the other zones in the~urvey area.
None of the land is under cultivation and native vegetation flourishes over an area of wind/tidal flats, clay
dunes and grassy plains bordering Laguna Madre. The western part of the zone, consisting of a flat surface of
algal-bound mud and sand(Mallouf, Baskin and Killen 1977)
deposited by the transgression of Laguna Madre (Brown et
aZ 1980) is coarse rangeland utilizing the native gulf
cordgrass, sacahuiste (Spartina spartinae). Stabilized
clay dunes divide this flat grassland from the wind/tidal

•

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE SURVEY BY ZONE

flats.

The stabilized dunes are covered with sacahuiste

(Spartina spartinae), seacoast bluestem (Andropogon
scoparius), prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri), Spanish
dagger and soaptree yucca (Yucca spp.) and mesquite
(Prosopia glandulosa).
The wind/tidal flats are covered

with low herbaceous vegetation which is highly salt tolerant such as saltgrass (Distchlis spicata), moss rose
(Portulaca pilosa), spikebrush (Eleocharis sp.) and
leafless cress (Cressa nudicaulis). The vegetation
of Environmental Zone VI is summarized in Table 12.
Flooding in Zone VI is frequent due to tidal
surges which wash over Padre Island during tropical storms
and hurricanes. These flush the low areas with seawater
so that only salt-tolerant plant species are able to
maintain themselves. The storms also increase the normal
erosion of the clay dunes by the wind.
The animal life of Environmental Zone VI is rich
in species, and species rare throughout the Tamaulipan
province are common in the clay dunes. Deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynz rufus),
raccoon (Procyon lotor) and fox (Urocyon) are common
in the clay dunes and brush areas. The Mexican pocket
mouse (Liomys irroratus) and rice rat (Orzyomys couesi)
found only in the Tamaulipan province are common in the
coastal area (Blair 1950). The southern Plains woodrat
(Neotoma micropus) is very common in the clay dunes along
with several species of ground squirrel (Spermophilus
spp.) and rabbits (Lepus sp. and Sylvilagus sp.).
Common species of lizard include the racerunner (Cnemidophorus gularis), several species of fence lizards
(Sceloporus spp.) and the keeled earless lizard (Holbrookia propinqua) (Blair 1950).
The most commonly
observed reptile in Zone VI, the Texas tortoise (Copherus
berlandieri), is found only in the Tamaulipan province.
The Texas tortoise and indigo snake (Drymarchon corais),
also observed in Zone VI, are considered rare and their
abundance in the clay dune area of Environmental Zone VI
reflects the relatively unspoiled nature of the area.
Table 10 summarizes the faunal elements found in Environ~
mental Zone VI. The birdlife (Table 11) is abundant with
many species of waders and sea birds such as the Common
Egret (Casmerodius albus), Cattle egret (Bubulicus ibis),
Little Blue Heron (Florida caerulea), gulls (Larus spp.)
and numerous ducks and sandpipers (Calidris spp.).

CONCLUSIONS

CONCLUSIONS
The environment of the survey area as a whole has
changed radically in the past hundred years. The prairie
grasses and shrubs have been displaced by cultivated fields
and citrus groves, and only in the wilderness area of Zone
VI have the native flora and fauna been substantially preserved. In Environmental Zone I and II, only those species
of native plants which are good at pioneer colonization and
rapid growth in fallow and disturbed areas have survived.
Zone IV retains a higher percentage of the native thorny
brush chaparral in its rangeland area but has lost much of
its original habitat to cultivation. The faunal element of
the environment has suffered restriction of habitat and great
loss in numbers, particularly in the larger game species.
The smaller species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and
birds are ubiquitous to all zones and are highly adaptive
to coexisting with man's agricultural changes.
PREHISTORIC ENVIRONMENT
During the prehistoric period the area supported
prairie grasses and thorny brush chaparral over wide
areas interspersed with shifting sand dunes and deflated
areas. The underlying fluvial and deltaic sediments
deposited during the Pleistocene and early Holocene have
undergone steady erosion. At the end of the Pleistocene
the water source for the fluvial-deltaic complex gradually disappeared as the last of the northern glaciers
melted causing the slow reduction of the Rio Grande
drainage from a flowing river system (Brown et aZ 1980).
As the fluvial system dried up and filled with sediment,
abandonned channels formed water-filled depressions which
gradually lost their connections and became isolated.
During the Holocene, as the climate became progressively more arid, southeast winds developed eolian deflation areas and dunes (Brown et aZ 1980). Laguna Madre
formed and began transgressing landward forming the bays
and clay dune complex along the coast beginning around
3,400 B.P. (Brown et aZ 1980). Cyclic rainfall in the past
several thousand years has caused annual fluctuations of
aridity and changing patterns of dunes and depressions .
(Brown et aZ 1980). During much of the late Holocene the

159

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

depressions and low areas served as water catchments and local
drainage basins providing ephemeral water sources for animals.
The prehistoric environment was less dry and barren than that
found by early explorers in the survey area (Inglis 1964) but
has been subject to gradual change throughout the late Holocene. Correll and Johnston (1970) suggest that the prehistoric
climax vegetation of the region was grassland and that the
change to brushy chaparral did not occur until the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries.

INTRODUCTION
The study area reported on in this paper covers
selected parts of Hidalgo and Willacy counties, Texas.
The location of these study areas is shown in Figure 1
(Part I, p. 3). Hidalgo and Willacy counties are located
in extreme south Texas between approximately 97°15' and
98°32' west longitude and 26°5' and 26°38' north latitude.
Both counties are situated on the Texas portion of the
Atlantic-Gulf Coastal Plain, one of the major physiographic
provinces of the North American continent. This province
extends along the coast from near Long Island, New York,
to south of Tampico, Mexico. The boundaries of the
province are generally given as the land/water interface
towards the sea and the 600-foot contour line along the
inner or continental margins. Hidalgo and Willacy counties
lie on the outer or seaward margins of the Atlantic-Gulf
Coastal Plain, with Willacy County reaching the Gulf of
Mexico at its extension to South Padre Island. The highest
point in Hidalgo County is only 275 feet (84 meters) above
sea level while the lowest is 40 feet (12 meters). The
maximum elevation in Willacy County is just 50 feet (15
meters) above sea level, and in this county the lowest
is at sea level.
Within the Texas portion of the Atlantic-Gulf
Coastal Province the two counties in the study area are
situated in parts of two physical regions, or subdivisions,
of this larger province. These regions are the Rio Grande
Plain and the Lower Rio Grande Valley (Texas Almanac 197879). The Rio Grande Plain is bounded approximately by
San Antonio in the north, the Rio Grande River on the
south and west and the Gulf of Mexico on the east. The
entire plain is gently undulating and slopes toward the
Gulf. Historically, the area was covered by low stands
of forest (oak) and brush interspersed with prairie openings.
The creek bottoms were filled with a wider variety of
broadleaf trees such as elm, oak, sycamore, pecan and
willow. Today overgrazing and timber-c~tting have allowed
dense stands of brush (mesquite, dwarf oak, catclaw,
huajillo, huisache and black brush) to form, and these
even extend into the creek bottoms in places. Presently
some of this brush is being cleared by root-plowing and
replanted with native pasture grasses. Before the coming
of Europeans, significant numbers of deer, antelope and·
buffalo (bison) roamed over this plain. The outer (seaward)
margins were the wintering grounds for huge flocks of
migratory waterfowl. With this abundant wildlife population and a mild winter climate, the Rio Grande Plain

165

AIR PHOTO ANALYSIS

was undoubtedly an attractive environment for the aboriginal groups who inhabited the area .
•

The Lower Rio Grande Valley physical region mentioned earlier is really the extreme southeastern extension of the Rio Grande Plain, and it covers most of
Cameron, Hidalgo and Willacy counties. The deep alluvial
soils and somewhat flatter topography of this area generally have been used to separate it into a distinct region.
Although there is some disagreement among historical
writers, the Lower Valley was probably covered in the
past by grasslands with scattered large patches of dense
brush, especially along some of the watercourses. Today
most of the region has been cleared, and it is in cultivated agriculture, citrus plantations, or improved
pasture. Most of the cur~ent study area lies within this
physical region of Texas.
GEOLOGY
Along the inner or western margins; the Lower Rio
Grande Valley and the study area is an alluvial valley
that has been filled with hundreds of feet of Upper
Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments by the Rio Grande.
Downstream, or to the east, the river has developed a
delta complex which has been extended eastward into the
Gulf of Mexico to its modern position. The western end
of the study area is dominated by an alluvial valley
while the eastern end is dominated by surface topography
comprised of old deltaic landforms and which have, in
turn, been modified along the coast by eolian processes.
RIO GRANDE EMBAYMENT
The Lower Rio Grande Valley is part, of what is
believed to be a synclinal trough known as 'the Rio Grande
Embayment (Sellards, Adkins and Plummer 1966). The exact
limits of this embayment, especially on the western end,
have not been established, but may extend inland to
near Eagle Pass. The Embayment has been filled with
deep layers of alluvial sediments deposited by the Rio
Grande during Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary times. Coal
beds, oil and natural gas have been found in these sediments. The dominant upper formation in these coastal
sediments is the Beaumont clay which occurs broadly along

166

GEOLOGY

the entire Texas Gulf Coast tSellards. Adkins and Plummer
1966). In the Rio Grande Valley this formation is covered
by recent water-worked and windblown sand and silt. These
latter deposits are the predominant landforms that are
found at the surface in eastern Hidalgo County and all
of Willacy County.
West of a line drawn southeast of La Sal Vieja in
northwestern Willacy County to just east of La Villa in
Hidalgo County and then bending back sharply to the southeast toward San Benito, the predominant geologic formations
change sharply (Barnes 1976). The Lissie, Goliad and again
the Beaumont (south of Edinburg) formations all outcrop in
this region. There is a general northwest-to-southeast
alignment of the surface exposure to the contact zones of
these formations. ThrQughout the entire area;they have
largely been covered by a veneer of windblown deposits.
Both the Lissie and Goliad formations are predominantly
composed of clay, silt, sands and marls, and are similar
to but recognizably different from the Beaumont formation.
THE PLEISTOCENE
During the Pleistocene age the levels of the ocean
fluctuated greatly dropping as much as 135 meters (415 feet)
below present-day levels (Fisher et al 1972). During the
low water of the glacial periods, Gulf coastal streams
deposited sediments well offshore on the continental
margins. But during the interglacial periods with ice
melt and resulting sea level rise, Gulf Coast streams were
forced to construct sinuous delta-distributary systems
across the low-lying plains such as those near the mouth
of the Rio Grande. Overbank flooding of the distributary
streams allowed great quantities of alluvial materials to
be deposited in near-shore embayments (Mallouf, Baskin and
Killen 1977). The sediments built the delta lobes farther
into the offshore zone. As the delta lobes became overextended, the distributary streams supporting them could
not continue to move the amount of sediment being delivered
by the main parent stream (the Rio Grande). These overextended deltaic lobes were abandoned and shorter, more
direct routes were cut to the marine embayments. These
processes led to a complex series of delta landforms
such as natural levees, abandoned channels and shallow
basins filled primarily with interdistributary muds.
These landforms, modified by modern wind erosion, are the
principal surface features of the Lower Rio Grande Valley
today.
167

AIRPHOTO ANALYSIS

THE HOLOCENE
The last Pleistocene glacial period came to an
end 18-20,000 years ago, and the delta-building processes
of coastal rivers have remained active up to the present
time. These processes have shaped the major landform
units of the study area although more arid conditions
during the Holocene (18,000-4,500 years B.P.) have led
to the widespread eolian processes which remain active
in the Lower Rio Grande Valley to the current time.
THE RECENT PERIOD
The Rio Grande Delta complex extends from well
into Mexico south of the river almost to the northern
boundary of Willacy County on the north side of the river
in Texas. Today this delta system continues to build
seaward, albeit more slowly than in the past. The recent
geologic period of the Lower Rio Grande Valley probably
began about 4,500 years B.P. While there have been a
number of changes during this period, Brown et al (1976)
believe the present general outlines of the Rio Grande
Delta were evolved in the past 2,800-2,500 years, although
eolian processes have continued to modify the old surface
of the delta, especially along its northern, southern and
seaward (eastern) margins. The Arroyo Colorado and the
Rio Grande are the two principal streams of the delta
area and are the only ones capable of causing major
landform alterations on a regional scale. However, since
1900, human activities such as dam building on the Rio
Grande, development of floodways (especially abandoned
stream channels), drainage and irrigation ditches, and
general water control for agricultural purposes on the
Rio Grande landscape have largely negated the landformbuilding processes of these two streams except during
times of extremely heavy rainfall and consequent flooding
such as those which accompany hurricanes or' tropical
depressions known as easterly waves.
FACTORS AFFECTING IDENTIFICATION OF SITES
If we accept the end of the last Pleistocene
glacial period as being about 18-20,000 years B.P., this
is about the time early man entered North America and
is not too long before man first appeared in Texas

168

FACTORS AFFECTING IDENTIFICATION OF SITES

although there is disagreement among archeologists as to
the exact date of this event. As has been pointed out,
the Rio Grande Delta was well established, although still
active, by the end of the Pleistocene. Because the
Holocene was a more arid period than those which preceded
it, the Rio Grande Valley, with its more dependable source
of water and attendant riparian vegetation, formed a fertile
zone along almost its entire length which undoubtedly
attracted varied wildlife populations. However, away from
the main stream channels, the semiarid climate and the lack
of dependable water sources presents a harsh environment
in terms of a hunting and gathering way of life.
There is no doubt that man inhabited the Lower Rio
Grande Valley at a relatively early date; however, the
physical evidence which reflects this utilization is
difficult to identify.' This is due in part to the nature
of the presumed adaptation (hunting and gathering), in
part to the dearth of durable artifacts used by the inhabitants, and in part to the geological processes which
are active into the present time. Further, modern land use
has substantially altered the natural landscape. Five of
the major factors which affect site recognition are summarized in the following discussion.
First, the Lower Rio Grande Valley has a low elevation above the Gulf. ,The low elevation, iimited relief, gentle
gradient toward tne Gulf proximity to the ocean and
physical nature of the afluvial s~diments means fhe area
is, and has been, subjected to severe, prolonged and
somewhat unpredictable flooding. This is expected to have
influenced the prehistoric inhabitants to select campsites
which were located on the somewhat higher ground provided
by the natural levees, on the clay dunes along the Laguna
Madre, and on the less active sand dunes inland from the
marine plain. This does not mean that the inhabitants
did not occupy or utilize the remainde~of the Deltaic
Plain, but rather that their occupancy of these areas was
undoubtedly less permanent and more in the nature of
tempo ra ry camps.
A second problem with identifying the cultural
record is that the Lower Rio Grande Valley has remained
a highly active geologic environment. Downstream movement
of sediments, changes in rainfall patterns, and periodic
flooding from tropical depressions, when combined with
limited relief and low elevation, means that stream channels

169

AIRPHOTO ANALYSIS

had to constantly shift their courses as they adjusted
to high and low water conditions and the varying levels
and kinds of sediments brought down by the main river.
As a result, many sites were undoubtedly buried, and
some were destroyed' by natural processes long before
Europeans reached this area of Texas.
A third difficulty is that the Lower Valley does
not contain hard rock surface formations such as those
found along the middle reaches of the Rio Grande where
prehistoric occupations are frequently associated with
rock overhangs and caves. Human occupations in the
Lower Valley were more ephemeral or in the nature of
semipermanent campsites which could easily be moved to
avoid floods, to follow the movement of wild game, or to
take advantage of seasonal variations which might provide opportunities for gathering activities. As a
result, these Lower Valley sites were never as permanent
as the rockshelter sites upstream nor were they occupied
for so long and continuous a period of time.
A fourth factor which has made it difficult to
trace man's cultural record on the Lower Rio Grande Plain
is the considerable modification of the Deltaic Plain by
eolian processes. This is true both for those areas
nearer to the coast and those areas as far inland as
west of the Edinburg-McAllen axis where there is still
a considerable veneer of windblown deposits which may
partially mask prehistoric sites.
The fifth, final and perhaps most significant
problem with identifying former sites of man's occupancy
in the Lower Rio Grande Valley is the development of
intensive, large-scale, commercial irrigated agriculture
on the Rio Grande Plain and the current population concentrations associated with this development. Today
practically the entire surface area of the Lower Valley
has been modified by man's recent activiti~s. Brush
has been cleared and fields have been leveled, drained
and often deep-plowed. Irrigation and drainage canals
have been constructed. The water table has been disturbed.
Abandoned distributary channels have been deepened to be
used for flood control and their natural levees have been
heightened (sometimes with the addition of several
meters of spoil which undoubtedly has buried a number
of sites).
The development of cities, transportation
routes and other monumental land-use changes have

17D

PREDICTION OF SITES

undoubtedly destroyed, or covered over, numerous prehistoric
sites.
As a result of these five factors, the record of
former human use of the Lower Rio Grande Valley has been
disturbed but not obliterated. Our purpose here is to
attempt to predict where field investigations should logically
be directed in order to discover those sites which might lie
along the course of the floodways which are being planned
for the Lower Valley. The next sections of this report will
be directed to this task.
PREDICTION OF SITES
Because the entire lower Rio Grande Plain and Delta
Complex is relatively level, low-lying and subjected to
occasional, but unpredictable and severe, flooding resulting
from hurricanes and/or easterly waves, it is predicted that
the larger and more permanent prehistoric sites will be
found on the topographic highs near permanent or semipermanent sources of water (see Predictive Model , Part I of
this report). Such topographic locations include: (1)
natural levees along relict distributary channels, (2)
stabilized sand and clay dunes, and (3) the margins of
eolian or other depressions. Certainly, prehistoric
peoples moved freely and easily about the Plain, and
temporary and semipermanent camps were widely scattered
throughout the region in response to local wildlife concentrations, vegetable products (nuts, berries, roots)
which could be gathered (perhaps seasonally) and availability
of water and wood. However, the higher ground remained a
preferred place for occupation, especially during flood
conditions.
Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977) have divided the
present study area into seven regions which they term
"Environmental Zones." These zones were adapted from
Barnes (1976) and Brown et al (1980), but were also based
on field observations regarding vegetation and modern
land use. The definitions of the seven environmental
zones, and two additional newly defined zones, are incluped
in Part I of this study and are not reported here.

AIRPHOTO ANALYSIS

AIRPHOTO ANALYSIS
To begin this study, color air photographs from
NASA Mission 220 were examined and then placed in a ZoomTransfer Scope where they were projected, at corrected
scale, onto 7.5' USGS maps at a scale of 1:24 000. These
maps were marked with the locations of the proposed channel
alignments and easements. The NASA air photographs were
recorded on SO-397 type film on 7 November 1972. Color
infrared film (CIR) from NASA Mission 208 was also used
to enhance interpretation. This NASA mission took place
on 31 August 1972 using film type 2443.
Discernible photo signatures projected onto the
7.5' quadrangles through the Zoom-Transfer Scope were
then recorded on the mapi using color codes. These largescale maps were then correlated with: (1) Environmental
Geologic Atlas of the Texas Coastal Zone, BrownsvilleHarlingen Area (Brown et al 1980), (2) Geologic Atlas
of Texas, McAllen-Brownsville Sheet (Barnes 1976), and
(3) A Predictive Assessment of Cultural Resources in
Hidalgo and Willacy Counties, Texas (Mallo·uf, Baskin and

Killen 1977); field data gathered from visits to the
study area, plus the personal experiences of the authors
while conducting field trips to the area over a fifteenyear period, were also used.
While many of the surface features were recognizable during this phase of the analysis, there were problems in recognizing many of the shallow surface depressions which dot the area. Prints of the imagery from
NASA Mission 220 were obtained and further analysis was
conducted with the aid of a stereoscopic viewer. The
relict distributary channel scars were easier to recognize through the use of the stereoscopic viewer, and
numerous previously unrecognized shallow surface depressions were identified. Relatively few of these depressions are deep enough to appear on the USGS 7.5' topographic maps of the area, and while the identifiable
features on those maps are useful, they are deceiving
in the sense that there are hundreds of depressions
which are not shown. All of the identified surface
features in and adjacent to the project alignment were
plotted on the USGS 7.5' maps previously used in the
Zoom-Transfer Scope analysis.

AIRPHOTO ANALYSIS

The result of this analysis is a striking display
of extremely complex meander scars and surface depressions
distributed across the landscape. The features correlate
very well with the geologic and environmental settings
discussed previously in this report. Environmental Zone
I reflects the strong surface expression of the veneer
of sand in that zone. In terms of the depressions examined, there is a high correlation of sites to the eolian
depressions (Figs. 20 and 21). Practically all evidence
of distributary channels has been masked by the eolian
deposits.
Environmental Zone II contains both eolian depressions and relatively sparse relict channel scars which
appear to indicate a thinner veneer of windblown deposits.
There is still a high ~orrelation of site oc~urrence to
both eolian depressions and channel scars; however, the
incidence of site occurrence seems to be less than in
Zone I (Figs. 20 and 21).
There is a veritable maze of relict distributary
channel scars which are identified in Environmental Zone
IV. Surface depressions in this zone are associated with
the channel scars; in contrast to Zone I, and to an extent
Zone II, the origin of these depressions appears to be
related to both fluvial and eolian processes. It is
assumed that as the channels filled with mud, silt and
sand, shallow ponds developed; during periods of low
rainfall, these ponds are assumed to have dried up with
the result that wind deflation occurred on the barren
surfaces. There appears to be a definite correlation
between site occurrence and both the channel scars and
the depressions (Figs. 21 and 22). The relative paucity
of si tes in the central secti on of Zone IV is probably
related more to sampling error than to the lack of sites.
The eastern portion of Zone IV encompasses channel segment
A-B which was intensively surveyed; the>frequency of site
occurrence certainly reflects the intensity of survey in
that part of the project area.
The Laguna Madre estuary system, Environmental
Zone VI, yielded the least returns during the airphoto
analysis. The clay dunes associated with that zone are
clearly defined on the USGS 7.5' maps and no additional
significant data regarding dune distributions or characteristics were obtained. Site distributions in that
area were as expected in the sense of a high correlation
173

AIRPHOTO ANALYSIS

of site occurrence with clay dunes. However, the field
investigations showed that some sites do occur on the
marine plain in contrast to the expectations that no
sites would occur in that setting.
Parts of Environmental Zone IX are similar in
some respects to Zone II. In particular, in the area
of channel segment I-J there are a few relict channel
scars visible, but there are fewer depressions overall
than in Zone II. The site density in this area of the
zone is low. Further south in Zone IX, the area of the
pump stations near Mercedes is more characteristic of
this zone (Fig. 23). There is a well-developed system
of distributary channel scars and depressions which
includes the current primary active distributary channel,
the Arroyo Colorado. The paucity of sites located in
this area during the present survey probably reflects
the small surface area examined rather than a lack of
sites. This general area of the Arroyo Colorado is
especially well known due to the prehistoric cemetery
sites which have been previously investigated in that
region.
CONCLUSIONS
The airphoto analysis proved to be an essential
part of the survey and assessments. Subtle topographic
features which reveal the complex delta system in the
Rio Grande Delta region were readily identifiable during
the analysis of the airphotos. Many of these features
do not appear on the standard USGS 7.5' topographic maps
which are normally used during archeological surveys.
These features include shallow eolian surface de~ressions,
relict mud-filled distributary channel sc~rs and associated depressions, and the low levees which,border the
old channel scars.
Identifiable features which coincided with the
project alignment were drawn onto USGS 7.5' maps; these
were then used in carrying out the field work with a
much greater degree of accuracy than otherwise would have
been possible. Based on the site location model developed for this survey, it was possible to predict potential site occurrences with a relatively high degree of
accuracy. While there is not necessarily an archeological

AIRPHOTO ANALYSIS

site adjacent to every depression or along every channel
scar levee, there is certainly a high correlation between
those topographic features and the locations of sites
identified during the field work.
In combination with the locational model and the
observed field data, the airphoto analysis has been used
as an effective tool with which to select specific areas
of high site presence potential; these are the areas
recommended for monitoring in Parts I and II of this
report. In view of the quantity of site survey data
which has now been generated within the Rio Grande Delta,
it is felt that this type of airphoto analysis could be
used to advantage in conjunction with the previously
described locational model in an effort to provide a
comprehensive planning tool in regards to the archeology
of the region. However, it is beyond the scope of this
project to attempt this task.
While there are significant recognizable benefits
to using airphoto analysis as an aid to site location
prediction, there are other factors which must be considered. As stated before, the Rio Grande Delta has
been very active geologically during the past several
thousand years, and at the present time there are no
precise chronological controls with which to correlate
the natural events with the human events. This implies
that at this stage of our knowledge of the region, the
possibility for the existence of deeply buried or submerged sites should not be ruled out nor overlooked.
Although the indications are that relatively early sites
may be only shallowly buried and associated with currently
vi si ble features (e. g. , site 41WY60 where exti nct horse
remains were found), this aspect of site location
patterning has not been explored sufficiently to reach
substantive conclusions. However, the very fact that
presumed late Pleistocene or early Holocene, fauna has
been found in apparent association with sudicially
exposed geological features suggests that many sites
of that, and hence later, age may be predicted on the
basis of the type of detailed airphoto analysis which
was carried out during this study.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
The sixty-three sites and fifteen isolated finds
recorded or revisited during the course of the surveys
conducted for the Corps of Engineers and the local sponsors
are described in this appendix. The presentation of the
sites is organized first by sites as opposed to isolated
finds, then within these categories the sites are arranged
in alphabetical order of the two counties. The organization of the site descriptions is straightforward; the
site number and locational data are by basic descriptions
of the site, materials observed, descriptions of any subsurface probes, assessments, and, finally, recommendations.
Regardless of their surface conditions, it is recognized
that intact, subsurface remains may exist at any of the
sites. Most site areas have therefore been recommended
for monitoring during construction. Sites 41WY34, 41WY71,
and 41WY72 are associated only with the locally sponsored
North Ditch survey, while sites 41WY62, 41WY63, 41WY73 and
41WY74 are associated with both surveys; all other sites are
related only to the present alignments included within Permit
11374. No distinctions between historic and prehistoric sites
are made in the site numbers which have been assigned. This
is in keeping with the system employed by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of the University of Texas
at Austin. All sites which were recorded by Mallouf, Baskin
and Killen (1977) are indicated with a parenthetical
notation following the site number.

Description: This site lies on a low rise surrounded
by plowed fields. The vegetation over the site is composed
of tall grass, prickly pear and mesquite. This cemetery
site is believed to be associated with the historic Las
Burras Ranch. Existing gravemarkers on the site date from
the late 1800's to the mid-1960's. The burials appear to
be generally oriented with the head to the west and the
feet to the east. Gravemarkers range from two which have
large elaborate markers with cement and iron surrounds
to many graves that are.marked by simple wooden or small
cement crosses (a few with bluish-green tile covers). The
area appears to have been burned off within the last few
years; apparently many of the gravemarkers were destroyed
and a count of the number of inhumations present is impossible.

Backhoe Trench 1, Area A: Thi s trench was excavated
to a maximum of 10 meters north and south and was approximately 1 meter wide with a minimum depth of 2 meters. A
profile drawing was made and five strata were recorded.
The top four strata correspond with those described in
Unit 1, Area A except only one chert flake was recovered
from Stratum 2 (a marked decline in cultural materials).
Stratum 5 appears in three small areas at the
bottom of the uneven trench floor.
It differs from Stratum
4 in that it has noticeably less calcium carbonate concretions and pea gravels and a marked increase in clay content.
No cultural materials were observed in this stratum. It
may be sloping from the south to the north.
AREA B
Shovel Tests 1 through 5, Area B: These shovel
tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 60 centimeters.
No cultural materials were observed.
Test Uni t 1, Area B: Thi s uni twas ori ented north
and south. A secondary datum was established at the northwest corner of the unit at ground surface. Excavations
were carried out in 20-centimeter arbitrary levels to a
maximum depth of 100 centimeters on the north side and 140
centimeters on the south side. A south wall profile was
drawn and revealed four differing strata.
Stratum 1 is a moist dark brown silt and sand with
some organic mottling and insect burrowing. Obvious plow
scars were noted and indicate that at one time this area
had been cultivated. Materials observed were 16 burned
bone fragments, 1 clear glass fragment (probably recent),
and 23 terrestrial snail shells and shell fragments.
Stratum 2 is a moist compact medium brown silt and
sand. Materials observed were 1 primary>flake, 3 tertiary
flakes (1 edge-damaged), 2 decorticate chips, 4 burned clay
lumps, 1 charcoal fragment (probably recent), pea gravels
and 5 terrestri al snai 1 shells and shell fragments.
Stratum 3 is similar to Stratum 2 except for the
appearance of calcium Carbonate concretions. Materials
observed were 1 secondary flake, 3 tertiary flakes, 1
partially decorticate chip, 3 decorticate chips, 8 burned
cl ay 1umps, 22 terrestri al snai 1 shell s and shell fragments,
pea gravels and calcium carbonate and sandy concretions.

211

SITE DESCRIPTIONS

Stratum 4 is a light brown silt and sand containing calcium carbonate concretions. Materials observed
were terrestrial snail shell fragments, pea gravels and
calcium carbonate concretions.
Assessment: Sufface reconnaissance and limited
testing revealed a large horizontal extent and stratified
deposits of cultural materials. Investigations did not
allow for a determination of the horizontal extent of
the site nor a definitive statement concerning the stratified portions of the site. Clearly this site has a high
information yield potential. It is expected that cultural
materials in the form of features and/or burials are
present.
Recommendations: , It is recommended that further
testing be accomplished prior to construction of the proposed section of drainage channel. A considerable amount
of time should be given to mapping the surface distributions of artifact concentrations and to additional excavations which will allow for a more precise determination
of the horizontal and vertical extent of the site. This
work should be of sufficient scope to allow lhe investigator to assess whether the site is eligibl~ for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Prior
to the commencement of further investigations, a clarification as to the exact channel alignment should be made.
As indicated in Figure 24, the channel does not coincide
between the Citrus City 7.5' map and the Alton 7.5' map.

WILLACY COUNTY

Location: This site is located on the El Sauz Ranch
and is situated 2.6 kilometers east of the main ranch road
and approximately 50 meters south of the easement for the
proposed North Ditch.
Description: The site is located on a low knoll
which rises above the surrounding land. A large water-bearing
eolian depression lies about 150 meters southwest of the
site.
Examination of an 1884 map of Cameron County indicates
that this apparently is the historic site of the Palo
Blanco Ranch (see Part Ill, Appendix I, Historical Background).
An abandoned modern north/south ranch road provides access
to the site and transects the easement of the North Ditch.
Vegetation has been cleared from the site and most of the
surrounding area in recent years. Currently the flora is
composed of 1 meter to 1.5 meter high stands of thorny brush
with isolated open grassy areas dispersed over the knoll
and the lower surrounding terrain.
Horizontal Extent: Not clearly defined; surficially
exposed material observed to occur in an area of approximately 125 meters east/west by 75 meters north/south.
Vertical Extent:

obscured any possible surficially exposed foundation or
other features. There is a strong possibility that buried
features in the form of structure foundations and/or
associated activity loci may exist.
Recommendations: The complete horizontal extent
of this site could not be determined accurately on the basis
of the sparse surficially exposed artifacts. However, the
main ranch house and associated features probably are restricted to the general area of the knoll and are marginal
to the southern edge of the proposed North Ditch right-ofway.
It is recommended that the site area be monitored
during construction since it is possible that associated
outbuildings may lie within the channel alignment area.
219

SITE DESCRIPTIONS

However, it is cautioned that if for any reason the proposed
alignment of the North Ditch is shifted to the south and
direct conflicts with 41WY34 become unavoidable, then it is
recommended that intensive investigations of this nineteenthcentury ranch complex be initiated prior to construction.

east of the existing drainage channel outfall and 2.6 kilometers west of Josephine Island.
Description: The site lies near the southern edge
of a clay dune. Cultural materials and one inhumation were
observed along the erosional bank of the dune. Vegetation
on the site is composed of dense stands of thorny brush
and a variety of cacti. Occasional open grassy areas are
found along the erosional area and scattered throughout the
dense brush.
Horizontal Extent: Approximately 100-125 meters
along the erosional face of the clay dune.
Vertical Extent: The inhumation was removed from
between 112 and 133 centimeters below 9round surface.
Materials Observed: All cultural" materials on the
surface were eroding from the cutbank and c6~sisted of the
upper portion of a human cranium; 5 long bone fragments (1
modified, fits with a buried piece at back of cranium);
2 marine shell fragments (one edge-damaged); and 7 freshwater otoliths. Several marine and terrestrial gastropods
(snail shells) and several specimens of bone were recovered
from the subsurface probes.

centimeters north/south and an average of 60 centimeters
east/west (near the top of the probe) was superimposed above
the human cranium. Excavations were carried out in 20centimeter arbitrary levels to a depth of 180 centimeters
(9 levels). The profile revealed fifteen natural strata,
two hearth features and one inhumation.
Stratum 1 is a medium brown to greyish-brown clay
and silt. It is chunky, dry and angular containing grass
rootlets and roots from the brush. No cultural materials
were observed. Average thickness is 12.5 centimeters.

sible organic zone. One tiny bone fragment was recovered
from this stratum. Average thickness is 5 centimeters.
Stratum 15 is a moist light brown silt and clay
with some sand content. Moist sticky clay dominates
this stratum. No cultural materials were recovered.
Average thickness is 22 centimeters and continues below

Assessment: Limited excavation provided a glimpse
of a stratified site. Two features and one inhumation were
unearthed. Present data suggests that this site has a high
information yield potential.
It is probable that additional cultural materials in the form of stratified features
and/or burials may be present.
Recommendations: Reconnaissance and limited
excavation did not provide an adequate amount of information to firmly assess whether this site appears eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places. Additional testing to determine the extent of
the site prior to construction of the drainage channel
is recommended.

2.6 kilometers east of the juncture of the existin9 channel
se9ment and the main ranch road.
Description: This site is an early nineteenthcentury ranch complex. Present at the site is a large
modern stock tank, a water well, and a windmill. A large
eolian depression lies south of the site area. Collection
of artifacts was hampered by high water left behind by
Hurricane Allen. Natural vegetation in the area consists
of stands of mesquite trees around the depression and
open grassy areas and isolated clumps of dense thorn brush.

is composed of salt-tolerant grasses, occasional thorny bushes,
and prickly pear and other cacti.
Horizontal Extent: Approximately 50 meters north/
south and 100 meters east/west.
Vertical Extent:

Undetermined.

Materials Observed: 1 unmodified decorticate chip
(heavily patinated); 1 conch columnella (not collected), 1
specimen of marine fish; 1 freshwater otolith; and miscellaneous materials.
Subsurface Probes:

None.

Assessments: This site contains cultural materials
eroding from a clay dune. Present data suggests that this
site exhibits a high information yield potential. It is
believed that floodwater runoff from the drainage channel
should not affect this site due to its distance from the
outfall and the possibilities for distribution of water
throughout the estuary system before it reaches the site.
Recommendations: Further work on the site in the
form of monitoring the long-term effects should be undertaken in the event that outfall currents accelerate the
erosional process. Otherwise, no further work is recommended in conjunction with the current project.

Description:
The site lies on the southern end of
a large clay dune that extends generally north to south. Cultural materials were observed along the erosional bank of the
dune. Vegetation on the site is composed of dense stands of
thorny brush and prickly pear cactus. Occasional open grassy
areas are found along the erosional area and scattered
throughout the dense brush.
Horizontal Extent:

Materials Observed: Surface materials collected
were 1 modified primary flake; 4 prehistoric pots~erds
(possible Rockport ware); 6 marine pelecypods; 1 marine
gastropod (olive shell); 31 specimens of bone; 1 marine
otolith; and miscellaneous materials. Several specimens
of terrestrial snail shell were recovered from the subsurface probes.
Subsurface Probes:
In addition to the reconnaissance, two subsurface probes were excavated (fig. 26). The
first (Subsurface Probe 1) was located on the southern portion of the site on top of the dune where the prehistoric
ceramic sherds were recovered. The second (Subsurface Probe
2) was located near the northern end of the site at a point
where bone fragments were noted to be eroding from the
erosional face of the clay dune.
Subsurface Probe 1 was 1x1 meter and reached a
maximum depth of 80 centimeters in its southern half and 100
centimeters in its northern half. A secondary datum was
placed at the northeastern corner of the probe, and excavations were carried out in 20-centimeter arbitrary levels.
The north profile revealed six natural strat~.
Subsurface Probe 2 involved cutting back the erosional face of the dune. The probe measured 100 centimeters
north and south and 150 centimeters east and west with a
maximum depth of 110 centimeters. Excavations were carried
out as a single level and the soil was hand-sorted for cultural materials. Profiles were drawn of the north and west
walls and revealed seven natural strata and a hearth feature
(Feature 1).

WILLACY COUNTY

appears to be within the alignment of the proposed North
Ditch.
Description: The site appears to be situated on
the east levee of a mud-filled relict distributary channel scar.
A water-bearing eolian depression is located to the west of
the site and in the relict channel scar. Vegetation on the
site is composed of a 1-1.5-meter-high stand of thorny brush
(apparent regrowth following recent land clearing activities)
which contains isolated small open grassy areas. A distinct
line of trees and brush separates the open grass bottom of
the relict channel scar from the brush-covered levee.
Horizontal Extent:

Undetermined.

Vertical Extent: Present information suggests
that the site is buried at about 60 centimeters below
ground surface.
Materials Observed: No cultural materials
were observed on the ground surface.
Subsurface Probes: A single lxI-meter unit was
excavated in 20-centimeter arbitrary levels to a depth of
100 centimeters below ground surface (fig. 27). The probe
was located on the east levee of the relict channel scar
within the alignment of the proposed North Ditch. Excavation of the five arbitrary levels revealed four natural
strata. Stratum 1 is composed of a dry, loose, brownishgrey silt.
Its average depth is approximately 5 centimeters.
No cultural materials were observed in this stratum.
Stratum 2 appears to be the same brownish-grey silt as found
in Stratum 1; however, Stratum 2 is distinctively more
compact. Burned clay lumps were found throughout the stratum
(16 collected). The average thickness of the stratum is
approximately 22 centimeters. Stratum 3. is composed of a
compact, dry, reddish-brown clay-silt mixture. It contains
a few small roots and some root staining. The average
thickness of the stratum is approximately 37 centimeters.
Near the bottom of the stratum (barely above Stratum 4)
at about 60 centimeters below ground surface, one patinated
chert chunk was recovered. Stratum 4 is composed of a
semi compact mottled brownish orange-red silt and clay
mixture containing calcium carbonate concretions. Its
average thickness is about 38 centimeters and appears
to continue below the maximum excavation depth.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS

Vertical Extent: Present information suggests that
the site is buried at about 80 centimeters below ground
surface.
Materials Observed: No cultural materials were
observed on the ground surface.
Subsurface Probes: A single 1x1-meter unit was
excavated in 20-centimeter arbitrary levels to a depth
of 120 centimeters below ground surface (Fig. 27). The
excavation was placed on the relict levee approximately
50 meters west of the mud-filled relict channel scar. Excavation of the six arbitrary levels revealed five natural
strata. Stratum 1 is composed of a grey to black silt
which is moderately compacted. The approximate depth of
this stratum is 23 centimeters. The top 10 centimeters
display a concentration of grass roots. Two burned clay
lumps and terrestrial snail shells were noted. Stratum
2 is a similar grey to black silt, moderately compacted.
The primary distinguishing feature between Stratum 1 and
Stratum 2 is mottling caused by small root molds. Burned
clay and terrestrial snail shells were noted throughout
this stratum which is about 22 centimeters thick. The
third stratum is a very compact dark brown loam and the
approximate thickness is 22 centimeters. Small root molds
and burned clay lumps were numerous throughout this lone.
Near the bottom of this stratum (approximately 76 centimeters below ground surface) a cultural layer was penetrated. Recovered were three tertiary flakes (one burned
and one from the top of Stratum 4), one decorticate chip,
five burned clay lumps, and charcoal flecks. Stratum 4
appears to be a slightly darker brown loam and is less
compact than Stratum 3. Approximate thickness is 21
centimeters. The fifth stratum is composed of a light
sandy clay with calcium carbonate inclusions. This
stratum begins at a depth of about 97 centimeters below
gound surface and continues to the bottom of ' the excavation (120 centimeters below ground surface). No cultural
debris was recorded in this lone.
Assessments: The subsurface nature of the site
suggests the possible presence of intact cultural deposits
in the form of concentrated camping debris, features and
burials. The circumstances which allowed discovery of the
site did not permit the determination of the extent or
,density of the site. The lack of these data precludes an

Recommendations: Further testing to define the limits
of this site should be undertaken in an effort to assess the
information yield potential in terms of National Register of
Historic Places eligibility. This should be accomplished
prior to construction in the area of the site.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS

Assessments: The materials collected are only
tenuous indicators of prehistoric habitation since no one
category of the materials clearly defines a prehistoric
site. However, the geological and environmental setting is
in accordance with other recorded site localities and it is
possible that the existing section of channel has penetrated the edge of a subsurface prehistoric site. Based
on the present evidence, this site exhibits limited information potential.
Recommendations: Monitoring of the site and immediately adjacent area should be accomplished during construction activities.

Artifact Analysis

Jane Laurens-Day
D. Will i amD ay

INTRODUCTION
Artifact collections were made at twenty-two sites
in Hidalgo County and thirty-one sites in Willacy County.
Nine of these sites, four in Hidalgo County and five in
Willacy County, were previously recorded by Mallouf, Baskin
and Killen (1977). Because they were situated within the
project area, these sites were revisited and additional
collections were made. One other site recorded by Mallouf,
Baskin and Killen (1977) (41HG41) was revisited, but no
collections were made since the site was inundated by floodwaters. Collections were also made from fifteen isolated
finds; ten are from Hidalgo County and five are from Willacy
County. Materials were collected from along both existing
and proposed channel alignments. No collections were made
at six of the seven historic ranch sites which were recorded
in Willacy County. All of these historic sites are beyond
the immediate project vicinity, and materials~observed
were recorded on site survey forms but were not collected.
Previous investigations in this area have shown that
the manifestations of cultural activity are frequently
difficult to interpret in the field. For this reason,
almost all visible materials present on a site or locality
were collected. Following analysis of these materials,
final judgments were made regarding whether a given area
should be designated as a site, an isolated find or a nonsite area. An attempt was made to collect at least samples
of the different kinds of materials in order to more fully
determine the nature and cultural affiliation of each site.
For purposes of this presentation, the prehistoric
artifacts are described first and are followed by descriptions
of the historic artifacts. A brief discussion of the
character and distributions of the artifacts follows the
descriptive sections.
Information which is contained within the description
of each category of artifacts includes the provenience by
site and appropriate references in addition to metric data.
Measurements are all given in millimeters (abbreviated mm);
other abbreviations used in the metric data include L for
length, W for width, and T for thickness. For those
artifacts with beveled working bits, such as gouges, the
edge angles were obtained with the aid of a contact goniometer and the measurements are stated in degrees (0). Other
data included where appropriate includes cross section,
workmanship and an identification of the material. In view
of the fact that most of the historic artifacts which were

281

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS

collected are apparently twentieth centruy in age, only
brief descriptions and provenience are provided, but no
precise measurements are given.
PREHISTORIC ARTIFACTS
This analysis attempts to place each object collected during the survey within a framework of descriptive
categories with decreasing levels of generality based on
type of material and morphology. Four major categories
of artifacts are recognized; these are knapped stone,
ground stone, ceramics and miscellaneous materials.
Miscellaneous materials include those categories which
are of dubious cultural or ,analytical significance.
Within each major division differing kinds of
artifacts or materials are recognized. The artifacts are
primarily identified through the use of functionally
descriptive terms (i.e., end scraper, projectile point,
etc.), although established names for recognized types
of artifacts (i.e .• OZmos bifaces, Matamoro. projectile
points) are used whenever possible.
Those specimens which are complete enough to
determine tool morphology and working surface characteristics are included in a number of descriptive forms.
The forms which are identified are intended to describe
what is felt to be meaningful variations within each
grouping of artifacts. With very few exceptions, the forms
which are recognized contain only individual artifacts.
The detailed nature of the descriptions provided
during the analysis was determined primarily by three
factors:
(1) the variability of the artifacts collected;
(2) the paucity of detailed reporting of loc~l lithic tool
assemblage and technologies; and (3) the importance of
regional comparisons to on-going and future research in
southern and coastal Texas.
Specific descriptive information was recorded
for each group and/or individual specimen. The kinds
of information recorded were consistent for every category except for certain groups which required additional
specific information; these are primarily composed of
282

PREHISTORIC ARTIFACTS

the gouges and other bifacially worked implements. The
presentation of the information within this report is
generally consistent with that used by Mallouf, Baskin
and Killen (1977).
KNAPPED STONE
Knapped stone includes all artifacts which were
manufactured through the process of removing flakes from
larger pieces of stone, and also includes the debitage
resulting from the manufacturing process. Five major
divisions of knapped stone were recognized during the
analysis of the 987 specimens included in this category.
These are: Cores, Flake Debitage, Projectile Points, Other
Bifacial Artifacts, and Unifacial Artifacts. ;
Cores (29 specimens)
Two distinct categories of cores were recognized
within the sample: conical and amorphous. Following
Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977), conical cores appear
to have a recognizable pattern of flake removal, while
amorphous cores, which include the majority of the specimens
recovered (27), appear to have no consistent pattern.
Groupings within the conical category include single-facet
unprepared (1) and prepared (1) platforms. Four different
groupings are included in the amorphous category: multiplefacet (2), tested (6), fragmentary (5), and depleted (14).
Twenty-two of the specimens are from Environmental Zone II,
five are from Environmental Zone I, and two are from
Environmental Zone IV.
The cores which were recovered generally appear to
represent the kinds of materials which are present in the
lithic flake debitage; these materials are commonly found
in the gravels associated with the Rio Grande Plain
(Sellards, Adkins and Plummer 1966: 34).' No cores of
exotic materials were recovered.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS

Prepared Platform (1 specimen):
Cortex covers
approximately 75% of the dorsal surface and is absent
on the ventral or striking surface. Material: chert.
Provenience: 41HG96.

AMORPHOUS CORES (27 specimens; Fig. 28b-d)
Multiple-Facet (2 specimens; Fig. 28b):
Flakes
have been removed from more than one striking plane;
cortex covers about 30% of the total surface area of one
(41HG86) and approximately 40% of the total surface area
of the other (41HG98). Both specimens are chert, and one
is possibly heat treated.
Tested (6 specimens; Fig. 28c): Three of the
specimens are small chert cobbles which have been split
and each retains 50% or more cortex (41HG83 [2J; 41HG93
[lJ). A fourth core is a medium-sized chert cobble with
one small cornerpiece removed; 95% of the cortex remains
(41HG96). The fifth specimen is a sample of algal limestone from which only a couple of flakes have been removed;
approximately 85% of the cortex remains (41HG97). The
last specimen is a large low-grade chert cobble which has
been minimally tested and subsequently broken; approximately 75% of the cortex remains (41HG96).
Core Fragments (5 specimens):
Four of the five
core fragments collected are chert cobbles which retain
from 20-50% of their cortex. The fifth fragment is a
rhyolite porphyry and retains no cortex (41WY75 [lJ;
41HG83 [lJ; 41HG96 [lJ; 41HG98 [2J).
Depleted (14 specimens; Fig. 28d):

Characteristic
of depleted cores, these specimens are small, oddly shaped,
and lack sufficient area for further flake removal. Three
retain 50% or more cortex; three retain 30% to 40% cortex;
five retain 25% to 5% cortex; and three haVe no remaining
cortex. Materials identified include chert (11), quartzite (1), chalcedony (1), and jasper (1). Two of the
chert cores are burned, and another is extremely patinated.
Provenience: 41WY67 (1); 41WY75 (1); 41HG83 (2); 41HG91
(1); 41HG92 (1); 41HG93 (1); 41HG94 (1); 41HG96 (5); and
IFHW14(WY) (1).
Flake Debitage (851 specimens)
A total of 851 specimens was examined for specific
flaking characteristics and separated into debitage
286

PREHISTORIC ARTIFACTS

•

categories. Two major categories are used: Flakes, which
include all complete and fragmentary specimens with a
complete striking platform, and chips, which include
fragments without a platform. These two categories were
then separated based on the presence or absence of intentional human modification.
Within this established framework, each flake was
examined for a number of characteristics, including:
(1) origin represented by the amount of cortex
present;
(2) technique of removal;
(3) platform type;
(4) material identification;
(5) flake size and completeness; and
(6) natural or unintentional surface modifications.
The techniques of removal, specimen size and type of platform could not be determined for 'chips; however, the other
characteristics were noted for each specimen.
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
Origin

The debitage was sorted in three categories according to the percentage of cortex remaining on the dorsal
surface. The terms used to divide flakes (primary, secondary,
and tertiary) describe the origin of the flake by its location near the exterior or interior of the cobble used and
represent successive stages of flake removal and/or tool
manufacture. The percentages of cortex used to define these
categori es are:
Primary
Secondary
Tertiary

At 1east 95% cortex
5% to 95% cortex
Less than 5% cortex

The purely descriptive terms corticate, partially decorticate
and decorticate are used for chips, consistent with the
terminology used by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977). Chips
are considered too fragmentary to be assigned an origin or
technique of manufacture.
287

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS

Technique of Removal

Three techniques of flake removal were recognized
within the debitage analyzed:
(1) hard hammer; (2) soft
hammer; and (3) hammer and anvi 1. Defi nitions and descriptions for hammer techniques were taken from Shafer
(1973) and from Goode (1981).
Hard Hammer: General characteristics of hard hammer
flakes include prominent bulbs of percussion, relatively
straight cross sections, and platforms that are relatively
wide and thick and generally unprepared. Platforms can
also be sheared or split. Shafer warns that this is a
generalized description and can be inadequate for the
purposes of sorting (1973: 64) due to variations. which can
occur within this category. Because of this, ov'erall
flake morphology was taken into consideration during the
sorti ng.
Soft Hammer: Flake characteristics resulting from
soft hammer techniques include diffuse bulbs of percussion,
arched cross sections, and dorsal surfaces with several
f 1a kesc ar s . St r i kin g p1at form s whi c h are· "f 0 rm e d by the
convergence of two planes at angles of less than 90 degrees"
(Shafer 1973: 116) are normally prepared, are lipped on the
ventral side, and are usually lenticular when seen from the
top. Dulling, smoothing and/or some marginal retouch often
are present on such platforms (Shafer 1973: 116). Overall
flake morphology was taken into consideration during sorting
since variation can also occur in this technique.
Hammer and Anvil: Hammer and anvil debitage exhibits
three major kinds of percussion surfaces which are discussed
by Binford and Quimby (1963: 277-307). One kind, ridge of
percussion,
is defined by the line of convergence of
two opposite cleavage faces. It is normally
straight and considerably bruised with many
short hinge fracture scars on the cleavage
faces directly below the ridge.
A second kind, point of percussion,
. . . is formed by the convergence of three
or more cleavage faces resulting in a pyramidal form, the apex of whi ch is the poi nt
of percussion.

PREHISTORIC ARTIFACTS

The third kind, area of percussion, is described as,
. . . generally the cortical surface of the
pebble from which flakes have been detached
along the edges.
Striking platforms resulting from the hammer and anvil
technique are characteristically crushed, sheared or split
(Goode 1981; Shafer 1973: 65-66).
Undetermined: A number of flake debitage specimens,
for one reason or another, could not be classified as to the
technique of removal, usually because the pl atform was
damaged suffi ci ent ly to precl ude positive i denti fi cation.
Striking PZatfarm

Four standard recognizable platform types are used
during the analysis: single-facet, multiple-facet, cortex
and crushed. Although these terms are commonly used in
lithic analyses, they "can be misleading due to similar
terms havi ng various connotations to the individual analyst"
(Mallouf 1976: 152). Mallouf gives a brief description
of the platform types except for crushed. The following
descriptions, except for crushed, are di rectly quoted from
Mallouf (1976: 152-155) and from Mallouf, Baskin and Killen
(1977: 287-289).
Sin g1e - fa ce t p1at form f 1a ke : a f1 a ke wit hap 1atform consisting of a single removal scar (facet) produced
by previous knapping.
Multiple-facet platform flake: a flake with a
platform consisting of two or more facets produced by
previous knappi ng.
Cortex platform flake: a flake with a platform of
unmodified weathered cortex. Because of the presence of
platform cortex, such flakes are classified as secondary
flakes. Note: A very few exceptions were made in our
analysis.
Crushed platform flake: a flake with platform that
has been damaged sufficiently so that the number of facets
could not be determined but with a portion of the platform
remaining.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS

Materials

Several different kinds of materials are recognized in the debitage. Chert was by far the most frequently used material with chalcedony, quartzite, igneous
(rhyolites and rhyolite porphyrys), jasper and agate
following in the order of decreasing numbers. Ogallala
quartzite (Goode 1981) or Ogallala chert (Mallouf, Baskin
and Killen 1977: 190) was recognized in the materials.
These lithic material types are all easily available from
Rio Grande gravels (Mallouf, Baskin and Killen 1977: 191;
Sellards, Adkins and Plummer 1966: 758-759,785-786;
Shelby 1981).
Size and Completeness

Measurements of the size of the flakes were taken
in 10-millimeter increments (i.e., 0-10 mm, 10-20 mm, 2030 mm, etc.). A fl ake was consi dered a fragment if the
distal end was broken and a true length could not be
determined. Complete flakes have an intact or mostly
intact distal end.
Surface Modification

Each specimen was examined for the presence of any
alteration, whether natural or cultural, to the surface
and/or internal structure of the specimen. Four different surficial modifications were noted: heat treatment,
burning, patination and edge damage. The characteristics
and definitions of heat treatment and burning discussed by
Skelton (1977: 210-216) were followed in the analysis of
the debitage. Whether a specimen was burned or not was
fairly evident, but heat treatment was not as easily recognized and only positive identifications were recorded.
Patination was a fairly easily recognizable surface
modification. The specimens usually had a cloudy/white
surficial appearance which allowed the true color of the
stone beneath to show. Some specimens, however, were
extremely patinated which almost completely changed the
original appearance of the flakes. Edge damage included
any sign of damage to the edge of a specimen. The cause
of damage, whether natural or cultural, was not determi ned
during the analysis; but any such damage was noted and
recorded. This factor did not include identifiable modification or wear from use.

PREHISTORIC ARTIFACTS

Modified Flakes and Chips

All of these specimens show a certain amount of
intentional modification; some show particular kinds of
wear or modification which indicate that they may have
served specific purposes. Most of the sample was recovered from the west end of the survey area with the
majority coming from site 41HG96, Environmental Zone
II. All were surficial finds except for three which were
recovered from subsurface probes at site 41HG96.
FLAKE DEBITAGE ANALYSIS
For the flake debitage, separate tabulations
are given for unmodified ,flakes, modified flakes, unmodified
chips and modified chips. Totals and percentages are
shown for each environmental zone for each major category.
A special notation is given only for any modified flake
and chip which exhibits a distinctive type of wear;
otherwise, location of wear is given in the tables provided for these two categories.

green porphyry. One of the sandstone fragments (41HG89)
is a medial segment of a lateral edge; the edge has been
ground to form a curved bevel. The second sandstone
specimen (41HG89) is long and narrow with parallel sides
and one convex end; the opposite end is absent. The lateral
edges of this specimen are the smoothest of the entire piece
and were apparently the working surfaces. The medial cross
section is lenticular. The third specimen (41HG96; Fig.
30m) exhibits the greatest modification; unfortunately,
both ends, one entire face, and a small portion of the
opposite face are missing. The remaining portion is subrectangular in outline and blocky and has two lateral
ridges which have been rounded and extensively smoothed by
grinding. Two of the ground stone specimens are from
Environmental Zone II (41HG96); the third is f~om Environmental Zone I (41HG89) ..
Stone Bead
A prehistoric ground and drilled bead (fig. 31i)
made out of a light salmon-pink to reddish layered sandstone was collected from site 41HG89 in Environmental Zone
I. This site, which is a little over 3.2 kilometers westnorthwest of Elsa, is the fartherest west where a marine
shell was recovered. Two triangular projectile points
(Matamoros), an Olmos biface variant, and several specimens
of lithic debitage were also collected from the site.
The bead is subrectangular in shape with one end
being slightly narrower than the other; both ends and the
lateral sides have been rounded and smoothed. The two
sides near the wider end have both been smoothed, but one
is rounded while the other is fairly flat. A circular
hole 6 millimeters wide at one end and 2.5 to 3 millimeters
wide at the other end has been drilled through the long
axis of the stone. The hole is not centered but is nearer
to the flatter side (approximately 1.5 miilimeters) than
to the more rounded side (approximately 5-6 millimeters).
At the smaller end, a second-drilled indentation was also
noted which may be where drilling was first begun and then
abandoned, or may represent an attempt to expand the
smaller hole to the size of the larger opening. This
secondary hole is only 4.75 millimeters in depth. The
dimensions of the bead are: L, 22 mm; W, 13.5 to 17.25
mm; T, 11.5 to 13 mm.

Over one-'half of the exterior of the bead and part
of the interior is covered by an unidentified eroded white
coating which is chalky in texture and appearance. This
substance appears to be a protective slip which was applied
over the sandstone.
A small Common Atlantic Marginella shell (Prunum
(Fig. 31h) was found wedged into the larger
opening of the bead; the shell was placed with the anterior
canal toward the interior and the spire toward the exterior
of the bead. The spire of the shell is missing. The length
of the remaining part of the shell is 8.25 millimeters; the
coloration is a very faded brownish-red. This specimen is

CERAMICS
Four small eroded prehistoric sherds (Fig. 31j-m)
were recovered in association with other cultural materials
from site 41WY60 in Environmental Zone VI on the surface
of a clay dune within the Laguna Madre estuary. Three
are body sherds, and one appears to be a rim sherd. All
of the sherds appear to be composed of a sandy paste; three
contain bone or shell tempering; the fourth contains
large mineral inclusions. The bone- or shell-tempered
sherds are light brownish-tan in exterior and interior
coloration. Two of the specimens exhibit a black substance
on one surface which may consist of asphaltum or recent
tar. The fourth sherd is 1 ight brownish-tan and dark
grey. The cores of all the sherds are dark grey. Sherd
thickness ranges from 4.5 to 6.5 millimeters. Because of
their small size and eroded nature, a poiitive determination on the identification cannot be "made; however,
these sherds are probably representative of Rockport Ware.
These seem to be very similar to other specimens described
in various references (Campbell 1962: 331-336; Suhm and
Jelks 1962: 131-136; Hester 1969: 47; Prewitt 1974: 59;

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS

MODIFIED BONE ARTIFACTS

•

Of the numerous bones which were collected, only
four specimens are modified. Three of the artifacts,
one from the surface and two recovered during excavation,
are from 41WY50 and are associated with Burial 1 (Environmental Zone V I). The fourth modified bone fragment is a
surface recovery associated with two specimens of unmodified lithic debitage from a badly disturbed site,
41WY76 (Zone II). Descriptions of these modified bone
artifacts are given below.
Hairpin (Fig. 31n)
Two of the three modified bone fragments associated
with Burial 1 (41WY50), when fitted together, form one
long thin artifact fashioned from a splinter of a large
mammal long bone (probably deer). There is no indication
that this is human bone. Both ends and most of one lateral
edge are missing, and there is a slight bow to the long
axis of the specimen which results in a crescentic cross
section. This piece has been shaped, thinned and smoothed,
and the lateral edges vary from sharp to rounded (possibly
from wear). One fragment of the specimen was found on
the surface of the clay dune adjacent to the partially exposed burial; the other was recovered under the cranium of
the burial. Because of its placement and fragile nature,
this artifact is interpreted to be a hairpin. The artifact
exhibits striations from the smoothing but apparently
was not decorated.

UNMODIFIED BONE ARTIFACTS
Two complete canine teeth (Fig. 31e-f) and eighteen
small tooth fragments (probably canid) were found in
association with Burial 1 (4IWY50). The canines, which
have been identified as Canis latrans, were not associated
with mandible or maxilla fragments. The inclusion of
canine teeth in direct association with the burial is
apparently culturally significant. Perforated canine teeth
have been recovered from the Ayala Site (Campbell
and Frizzell 1949); Floyd Morris Site (Collins, Hester
and Weir 1969); 41KL13 (Hester 1969) and are present
in the Anderson Collection housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at

Five of the specimens appear to be tools, four were
used for ornamental purposes, one has been broken for food
procurement, and the last has been broken for an undetermined
purpose. Descriptions of the shell artifacts which were recovered from the surfaces of the various sites are given
below.
Modified Whel k Shell (3 specimens)
One specimen is a turnip whelk (Fig. 31) which
has been modified through the use of the groove-and-snap
reduction technique. The outer lip and a large portion
of body whorl have been removed by cutting a vertical
groove which extends from the upper whorl down the body
of the shell; pressure aplJlied to the outer porti'on of
the shell resulted in a snap fracture along the groove.
The pointed end appears to have been utilized. The remaining columella and upper whorl do not exhibit evidence
of further attention. The length is approximately 159 mm.

The second almost complete specimen (Fig. 33),
which lacks a small portion of the outer lip of the whorl,
exhibits an extraction hole on the shoulder; the hole is
roughly circular and apparently resulted from a successful
attempt to remove the animal from its shell. The top of
the spire is missing and the tip of the anterior canal
is broken, but there are no signs of intentional modification other than that made for extracting the animal.

Four specimens are classified as scrapin9 tools.
One specimen, identified as a Sunray Venus clam (Macrocanista nimbosa) (Fig. 31a) (Abbott 1968: 236), shows
wear along a chipped convex to concave edge on the ventral
side of the outer margin. Scrapers of this type have been
found at various other sites, including the Kent Crane
Si te (Campbell 1952: 54); 77B5-2, 77B8-6 and 77B8-7
(Campbell 1956: 43); 41KLl3, 41KLl6, 41KL31 and 77C3-2
(2 specimens) (Hester 1969: 43); the Alazan Bay area
(Highley 19BO: 70), and are present in the Anderson
Collection from Cameron County and north~rn Tamaulipas,
Mexico. These scrapers have been attributed to the
Aransas Focus by Suhm, Krieger and Jelks (1954: 124)
and to the Brownsville Focus in the Rio Grande Delta
Region by Hester (1969: 43).
The remaining three specimens are small fragments
which show minimal wear on their outer dorsal margin.
One is an unidentifiable fragment, one is a fragment of
an Atlantic Bay Scallop (Aequipecten irradians) (Abbott
1968: 210), and the last is a fragment of a Florida

Four different kinds of ornamental shell are represented from four different sites. One is a Common Atlantic
Marginella (Prunum apicinum) (Fig. 31h) (Abbott 1968: 158)
which is directly associated with a drilled stone bead
(see description of Stone Bead). The spire of the shell'

PREHISTORIC ARTIFACTS

on site manifestations known prior to the survey indicated
that the materials present at many sites would be sparsely
distributed and might be difficult to interpret in a field
situation. The inclusion of many of the specimens described
below is based on the need to be as precise as possible for
cultural resources identification and assessment.
Siliceous and

I~ous

Materials

A total of twenty-five siliceous and igneous rock
fragments was colI ected; all are of materi a 1s used for
the manufacture of the prehistoric lithic artifacts recovered. Four of the specimens are small angular chunks
which are broken from causes other than intentional lithic
processing. The materidls represented include' chert,
quartzite and chalcedony; three of the specimens have been
burned to varying degrees. One is from Environmental Zone
I, and three are from Envi ronmenta 1 Zone I I.
Provenience:

41HG91 (I); 41HG94 (I); 41HG96 (2)

This category also includes twenty-one small
pebble fragments, some of which appear to have been
battered and may be core fragments. The specimens include
thirteen chert, two quartzite, two chalcedony, one rhyolite,
one rhyolite porphyry and two silicified wood pebbles.
Four of the pebble fragments were recovered from Environmental Zone I and seventeen from Environmental Zone II.
Burned Rocks
A sample of various sizes and shapes of burned
rocks were collected from several sites in Hidalgo
County near the western end of the project area. Most
of the materials were recovered from the· surface, but
several small fragments were recovered fram subsurface
probes at site 41HG96. Most of the material represented
is algal limestone which is discolored to a light to dark
grey and is fragmented by burning. Unfortunately, the
temporal affiliation of the surface finds is questionable
due to modern land-use activities. This material was
collected from five sites in Environmental Zone I and
from five sites in Environmental Zone II.

Large Sandstone Rock
A 1arge pi ece of browni sh-purpl e sandstone, ovate
in shape and quite thick, was recovered from a clay dune
(4IWYS9). Some natural erosion has occurred, but there
is no evidence of other modification. The size and weight
of this stone and its occurrence in the Laguna Madre
estuary system suggest that this specimen was intentionally
carried to its present location. This is also suggested
bY its association with prehistoric materials. This
specimen was recovered from Environmental Zone VI.

Seve r a 1 mi s c ell an e.o us roc ks, pebb 1e san d ',c 0 nglomerates were collected from various sites during the survey.
All of the specimens recovered from sites not on the El
Sauz Ranch or on the clay dunes appear to have been brought
in for various modern activities (road construction, etc.).
The few found on the El Sauz Ranch were found along the
drainage canal, and the one from a clay dune probably
represents Pleistocene gravels brought to t'he surface by
modern digging operations. None of the specimens appear
to have been used prehistorically.
Pumice
Examples of pumice, none of which show any signs
of modification or use, were recovered from sites on the
cl ay dunes (Envi ronmental Zone VI). Most of the specimens
are a natural light grey in color; several, however, are
a reddish-brown or black. All were apparently deposited
on the dunes by recent tides or recent hurricanes. Unless
there is modification and/or direct association with
prehistoric materials, pumice should not be used as an
indicator of aboriginal activity.
Concretions
-----Various calcium carbonate concretions were collected
from the survey area, primari ly from subsurface probes near
the western end of the project. The number of these white,
modular concretions increased with the depth of the probes,
346

PREHISTORIC ARTIFACTS

and a majority were recovered from a friable light brown
silty sand C soil horizon. The concretions were usually
associated with small pea gravels and with land snails
(most commonly Rabdotus alternatus). This material
was found at only one site (41HG96, Environmental Zone II).
Other kinds of concretions recovered include a few
sandy specimens and mineralized specimens. The latter
occurred primarily along the spoil banks of an existing
drainage canal on the El Sauz Ranch in an area where the
canal crosses the bottoms of relict channel scars. These
specimens appear to represent mineralized crab-hole casts
and probably originate from a fairly deep deposit. None
of the concretions collected appears to have resulted from
prehistoric cultural activity. These material~ were
collected from four sites in Environmental Zone IV and
from four sites in Environmental Zone V I.
Burned Clay
A large number of burned clay lumps of various
shapes and sizes were recovered during the course of the
survey. In an aboriginal context they are usually associated with hearth activities. The specimens were present
in three different associations and were either: (I)
definitely associated with prehistoric materials and/or
were in areas which had not been influenced by modern
activities; (2) definitely associated with materials or
situations which strictly related to modern activities
(not all of these were collected); or (3) in mixed
association with prehistoric and historic materials
and situations.
Specimens of burned clay cannot be attributed to
a certain temporal affiliation based on ~hysical appearance. The physical and cultural associations of any
burned clay recovered should be carefully examined before
such an affiliation is attempted. As previously stated
by Mallouf, Baskin and Killen (1977), the presence of
burned clay should not be used as a sole indicator of
aboriginal activities. Samples were recovered from
seven sites in Environmental Zone I, from nine sites and
one isolated find in Environmental Zone II, and from
seventeen sites in Environmental Zone IV.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS

Charcoal
Most of the charcoal noted during the survey was
on or near the surface and was associated with recent
activities (burned fields, burned trees, etc.). A small
amount of charcoal was recovered in a soil sample from one
of the prehistoric sites in the Laguna Madre. The
quantity is too small to be used for dating or identification.
HISTORIC ARTIFACTS
The materials included in this section are believed
to date generally from 19QO to the present. Most of the
specimens date between 1930 and 1950. There is no one
piece which has any real significance in terms of being
a precise chronological indicator or of being intrinsically
important.
These specimens are from ten sites in Hidalgo
County and from eight sites in Willacy County and are
from Envi ronmenta 1 Zones I, I I and IV.
In all there are 105 specimens from the entire
survey. These are classified into four categories and
then each category is divided into various types; the
major categories include: ceramics, glass, metal, and
miscellaneous. A brief description of each grouping
follows with a provenience table (Table 23) provided
at the end of the discussion.

DISCUSSION

The numbers and percentages of the artifacts
collected during the surveys and assessments in Hidalgo and
Willacy counties are presented by major categories in Table
17. It is significant to note that 81 percent of all artifacts
collected are composed of cores, flakes and chips while
an additional 10 percent are composed of historic artifacts;
the remaining 9 percent are composed of tools and ornaments.
Modified flakes and chips comprise 4 percent of the total
which is included within the first figure given; if these
are indeed tools, then the total of tools and ornaments is
increased to 13 percent of the total artifacts and debris.
Within the lithic artifacts, definite tools represent 8.5
percent of all lithic materials collected. Ceramics, bone
and shell artifacts compose only 2 percent of all prehistoric
artifacts; excluding cores and flakes, these three categories
represent 19.6 percent of all tools and orrraments in the
collection.:'
Perhaps more significant are the distributions of
the artifacts by environmental zone as shown in Table 18.
It is clear from this table that the vast majority of the
lithic artifacts occur in Zone I and II as opposed to
Zones IV and VI; Zone IX was not sufficiently sampled to
be of significance in the overall distributions. While
bone and shell artifacts occur in Zones I and II, there
are significantly large numbers present in Zone IV and
354

,

DISCUSSION

VI. These distributions are interpreted to reflect the
varying availability of raw materials in the differing
zones. At the same time, the presence of lithics in Zones
IVan d VI and she 11sin Z 0 ne I and I I are i nt e r pre ted to
reflect the transportation of these items from source areas
into adjacent areas away from the primary source. Whether
this transportation occurred as a result of the movements
of resident populations practicing a combined maritime/
savannah hunting and gathering adaptation or whether it
occurred as a result of an exchange network among groups
which pursued a maritime adaptation and groups which pursued a savannah adaptation is unknown.
The limited distribution of the ceramics (Zone VI)
may lend some evidence ,to the idea that some groups subsisted wholly in a maritime-based adaptation while other
groups were restricted to a savannah adaptation. However,
the possibility that the ceramics may represent interaction
between coastal groups should not be di smissed. Even so,
this may be a reflection 6f contact (or exchange of ideas
and/or goods) between groups restricted to the coast and
each of which operated in a maritime adaptation.
The distribution of the projectile points may also
be interpreted to support the maritime versus savannah
adaptation concept; 82 percent of these artifacts occur
in Zones I and II and suggests that hunting is more
important in the interior and reflects a savannah adaptation. Overall, projectile points represent 22 percent of
the bifacial and unifacial knapped stone artifacts while
apparent wood and hide working tools (gouges, Olmos bifaces and scrapers) are more strongly represented.
The normally diagnostic temporal indicators are
of little assistance in this collection., The small
Cameron projectile points are assumed (because of their
size) to be arrow points while the larger Matamoros and
Catan points are assumed to be dart points.
This indicates
a time span which includes both the Neo-Archaic and the
earlier Archaic stages, but so little is known of the
chronology in this region that it is best not to assign
specific temporal ranges.
It is sufficient for the moment
to indicate that the arrow points are late prehistoric
in age while the dart points represent some undetermined
but preceding time period.

APPENDIX VI
Analysis of Human Skeletal Material

Margaret Ann Howard

INTRODUCTION
Human s kel etal remai ns were recovered from two
areas during the present survey of Willacy and Hidalgo
counties. The material, all of which is from Willacy
County, includes a nearly complete and intact inhumation
from site 41WY50 and bone fragments, probably from another
burial, collected from site 41WY67.
ANALYSIS
41WY50
Human bone which was noted during the survey
eroding out of the side of a clay dune was the primary
factor in the identification of site 41WY50. Subsequent
controlled excavations' recovered a nearly co~plete skeleton and associated grave goods which were largely intact
(Fig. 34). The individual represented by the burial is
a subadult male 14 to 15 years of age. Based on measurements of the femur and humerus, his stature was between
5 feet 4 inches (163 centimeters) and 5 feet 5 inches
(166 centimeters) (Trotter and Gleser 1952: 496).
The bone is generally well preserved and exhibits
no evidence of rodent gnawing. Seepage of ground water
has caused post-mortem deterioration of some bone surfaces,
particularly those of the right side. The percentage of
the skeleton recovered during excavation was particularly
good (Fig. 35). All long bones in this young individual
are composed of separate diaphyses and epiphyses. At
least 70 percent of these epiphyses have been recovered,
including many minute phalange epiphyses, which indicates
an exceptional lack of disturbance and excellent bone
recovery.
Distinctive features used for sex determination
were observed for the most part on theinnominates. The
greater sciatic notch is both narrow and shallow; the
pubis is short with a narrow subpubic angle; and the
sacroiliac articulation is relatively flat. These traits
are indicative of the male sex which is confirmed by the
general robusticity of the post-cranial skeleton.
An age estimate was readily available from the·
epiphyseal state of many bones of the skeleton. The
lateral epicondyles of the humeri were approaching
375

ANALYSIS OF HUMAN SKELETAL MATERIAL

complete fusion; however, the acetabula of the inominates had just begun ossification activity and were less
advanced. These two points and stages of ephiphyseal
closure provided an age estimate of 14 to 15 years.
Dentition supports this assessment as the third molars
are in the second stage of eruption and they have penetrated through the alveolus but not the gum (this was
assessed from wear and other indications). Ephiphyseal
closure of the rest of the skeletal material is in accordance with this age estimate.
Many traits of the dentition are typical of
American Indian groups (Dahlberg 1951; Goldstein 1948).
Shovel-shaping of the incisors is exhibited on the upper
central and the lower central and lateral incisors. The
upper lateral incisors exh~bit anomalous "peg"-shaping
which appears to be associated with the shovel-shape
characteristic (Dahlberg 1951: 146). The lower canines
also show some shovel-shaping on the lower lingual surface. The relatively high frequency of these characteristics in Mongoloid racial groups is well documented
(Bass 1971: 235).
Two kinds of pre-mortem modification, which
confirm the aboriginal affiliation of the individual,
were noted during an examination of the skull. Cranial
deformation (Fig. 36) is evident at the junction of the
lambdoidal and sagittal sutures (where the occipital and
parietal bones meet at the upper back portion of the
skull). An area approximately 53 millimeters in diameter
exhibits flattening and the suture borders are slightly
offset, a deformation characteristic of individuals who
have been bound to a cradleboard in infancy (Bennett
1961). In individuals such as this one who exhibit a
strong occipital protuberance, it is common for such
deformation to be offset from the back of ~he head to
an area slightly above the occipital protuberance
(Bramblett 1980).
The second pre-mortem effect that is evident is
wear attrition of the teeth. First and second molars
show considerable removal of the occlusal surface (third
molars have not reached the occlusal surface), and the
dentin is exposed on both upper and lower incisors.
This type of wear, caused by the grit content of food

processed through the use of grinding stones, is indicative of American Indian populations, most particularly
those of Texas (Goldstein 1948: 66-67). Considering the
age of thi s i ndi vi dual, the degree of wear is pronounced.
Pathology is exhibited in this individual at two
locati ons. Advanced peri odontal di sease has caused the
alveolus to recede from the teeth; this is most marked
in the mandible but is also evident in the maxilla. This
type of disease, while not directly indicative of aboriginal populations, is rather common in prehistoric
peoples. Evidence of a general body infection is apparent in the left orbit where a linear area of osteoporotic
bone appears on the interior inferior surface of the
supra-orbital ridge. Osteoporosis occurring in this
location is usually indicative of a general bodY'infection, but not necessarily a serious one (Bramblett 1980),
and there is no reason to suspect that such an infection
was related to this individual's death.
In summary, the skeletal evidence represents
a subadult male who was 14 to 15 years of age at the
time of death, and whose stature was 5 feet 4 inches to
5 feet 5 inches (163 centimeters to 166 centimeters).
Cranial deformation, extensive dental wear, and shovelshaped incisors indicate that this individual was of
aboriginal American descent. Although peridontal disease
and general osteoporotic infection are both evident, the
cause of death is undetermined.
41WY67

Twelve fragments of human bones were recovered
with faunal remains and other cultural materials from
site 41WY67. The material was exposed on the spoil
ban k 0 fan ex i s tin g d r a ina gedit c h s e gm e nt.; all the
cultural materi als, i ncl udi ng the human bones, were
collected from the surface and were found out of primary
context.
All of the human bone specimens are incomplete
and exhibit post-mortem abrasion and pitting. The
fragments are not splintered, however, and some fragments
could be fitted together. Altogether, five matches
were made; the abraded nature of the surfaces at the
matches indicates that these breaks are not recent. The
fragments appear to represent the remains of a single

individual who was apparently a mature adult male and
approximately 40 years old at the time of death.
A portion of the mandible (Fig. 37), which
consists of three fragments representing about one-half
of the entire bone, is the most diagnostic element
recovered. The fragments extend from the left horizontal
ramus to the right mental foramen; the left mylohyoid
groove is apparent but the left mandibular foramen and
ascending ramus are absent.
The absence of teeth within the mandible is
particularly distinctive. The alveolus exhibits resorption on the left side of the body from the general location of the molars extending forward to the area of the
second left premol ar. From the fi rst 1eft premo".lar area
through the area of the right central incisor, the occlusal surface is badly abraded and broken but shows some
evidence of vestigal tooth sockets. The remaining area
of the body through the area of the first right premolar
has a sharp lipped crest without evidence of tooth sockets.
The mandible thus indicates an older individual
whose lower jaw is in various stages of compensation for
tooth loss. This may be the product of either attrition
or caries (Goldstein 1948: 67). The badly abraded area
perhaps reflects the most recent tooth loss since vestigal sockets are still apparent; the bony crest on the
right side reflects the closing of the socket area.
The area of advanced resorption on the left lateral area
of the body is a product of the prolonged absence of
teeth and subsequent alveolar withdrawal and rounding.
The extent of tooth loss suggests a mature individual.
In aboriginal populations, such a condition may occur as
early as age 40, whereas in modern populations it is
more prevalent at age 60 to 70. The mandible is an
indicator of sex as well as age. In this J.ndividual,
the chin is sUfficiently preserved to indi~~te the male
trait of a square inferior surface with a slight indentation at the midline. Consequently, the mandible
provides the majority of data on the vital statistics
of this individual.
Other fragments were not as well represented nor
were they as diagnostic. Three fragments of the parieta1s are identifiable by the characteristic arterial
grooves on the cerebral surface. One specimen which

exhibits a genetically anomalous feature in the form of
a large pit oriented toward the sagittal suture is
located at the juncture of the coronal and the sagittal
suture on the right parietal. Another of the fragments
adjoins the coronal surface on the middle portion of the
left parietal; the third fragment cannot be identified
as to side or position. The degree of suture closing
cannot be assessed on any of these fragments due to the
post-mortem abrasion of their edges.
Fragments of the clavicle, radius and third metacarpal were also recovered. Their diameters suggest that
they are associated with the other fragments and that
they also represent an adult individual. The radial
fragment includes the nutrient foramen; the orientation
of this feature indicate~ that the specimen is from the
right side. No siding or other identification can be made
for the clavicle. The metacarpal fragment recovered
includes the proximal end and a portion of the shaft.
Basal articular surfaces and general morphology indicate
that this specimen is from the left hand.
Two long bone fragments (Fig. 37) which fit together and appear to be from the midsection of either
the femur or the humerus are of particular interest.
Positive identification is complicated by the fact that
both an elongated crest (possible linea aspera) and a
spi ral groove (possi bly for the radi al nerve) are
exhibited on the specimen. A further complicating
factor is the extreme amount of lateral compression
exhibited towards one end of the midsection fragment.
Both the femur and, less frequently, the humerus are
known to exhibit certain degrees of platymeria or
anterio-posterior flattening; however, the compression
exhibited by this section appears to be at right angles
to the platymeric type. Actually, the flattening is
more reminiscent of the tibia, although other features
(described above) preclude this identification.
This anomaly appears to be due to compression
rather than deformation as the muscle-marking shows that
the limb was used. If the specimen is indeed platymeric,
it may have been caused by either a mechanical adaptation or a deficiency in bone material engendered by a
calcium or vitamin deficiency (Brothwell 1965: 88-91;
Buxton 1938). Because of the unusual nature of this
bone, which is complicated by conflicting features, and

384

DISCUSSION

the lack of corroborating osteological data from the site
or the region, these conclusions must remain tentative.
In summary, the excavation of the drainage ditch
which has exposed site 41WY67 apparently disturbed the
burial of a mature adult male. The twelve fragments
collected exhibit extreme tooth loss, breakage and abrasion, genetically anomalous pitting of a parietal fragment, and possibly a nutritional- or a deficiency-related
compression of a long bone.
DISCUSSION
The human ostenlogical materials reco~ered during
the present survey are similar in a number of respects to
other such materials previously recovered from this area.
Characteristics of the topography, associations, and
human biological data suggest an analogy to other South
Texas si tes, parti cul arly the Ayal a Si te (Campbell and
Fri zzell 1949; Hester and Ruecki ng 1969.), the Floyd Morri s
Site (Collins, Hester and Weir 1969), 41HG27 (Hester and
Rodgers 1971), and the Unland Site (Mallouf and Zavaleta
1979). These common aspects will be examined below with
the aim of placing sites 41WY50 and 41WY67 into a general
temporal and cultural context.
Topographically, the known sites in the Rio Grande
Delta region which contain human interments are situated
on low rises (levees) adjacent to relict distributary
channel scars. As Hester and Rodgers (1971: 370) poi nt
out, a number of these sites are on or near the north
side of the Arroyo Colorado. However, an equal number
of sites are known to be located at some distance to the
south (Prewitt 1974: 61) or to the nort·h of the Arroyo;
the Unland Site is a notable example. The immediate
top09raphic situation of low levee and associated relict
distributary channel is one distinctive topographic characteristic of these interment sites. The other distinctive
topographic situation is that of clay dunes which front
the Laguna Madre; the Rincon de Guajardo Site (41CF74)
(Prewitt 1974: 61) and site 41WY50 exemplify this setting.
The sites listed above are frequently portrayed
as single-purpose mortuary sites without associated
habitations in adjacent areas. However, this may reflect

385

ANALYSIS OF HUMAN SKELETAL MATERIAL

a bias in the extent of site sampling rather than a
cultural practice since most of the sites which have
been located and excavated have been investigated in
a salvage context. Site 41WY50 is one of the exceptions
to this in that it was located during a systematic survey.
Surface examination and subsequent testing revealed two
thin strata which contained features and cultural debris
overlying the burial. This possible association will
perhaps be clarified during future testing at 41WY50.
Numerical and associational characteristics of
the burials themselves vary greatly between sites. The
Ayala and Floyd Morris sites appear to be large cemetery
sites, while the Unland Site, 41HG27, 41WY50, and possibly 41WY67 all appear to be isolated multiple or single
burials. A pattern propo·sed by Hester (1969: 15'9) of
large cemetery sites within coastal areas and isolated
burials located in inland areas is no longer supported
by the data. Once again, however, site sampling introduces an indeterminate factor which precludes any firm
correlations. It is clear, however, that isolated
single burials such as those encountered during the
present survey are probably common within the region.
Artifact associations of the mortuary sites named
above suggest their linkage in a common cultural configuration. Bone and shell ornaments are associated with
most burials; turtle carapaces, red ochre, and asphaltum
are more rare. Projectile points found with these
burials indicate chronological placement to some extent.
Artifacts associated with one of the burials at
the Unland Site provide a tentative chronological identification for the nearly complete individual found at
41WY50. Burial B at the Unland Site has been idBntified
as a young individual based on the state of epiphyseal
union.
Associated artifacts are a shell fragment, two
turtle carapaces, a bone ornament, and four projectile
points. The latter have been identified as of the Fresno,
Cameron and Matamoros types and tentatively dated to a
period in the Late Prehistoric between A.D. 1400 and
1800 (Mallouf and Zavaleta 1979: 25). The particular
character linking the Unland Site and 41WY50 burials
is the presence of a bone ornament commonly called a
"hairpin." The split segments of long bone have been
bifacially smoothed and polished in both of these
specimens. Further, the individuals with which they

386

DISCUSSION

are associated are of roughly the same biological age.
Another artifactual association of 41WY50 identifies
it with the larger general cultural complex descri bed
above. Two canine incisors were found near the base of
the spine of this burial. Such items were commonly associated with burials at the Ayala and Floyd Morris sites.
These, however, were always perforated and were probably
associ ated with Oliva shell ti nklers (for whi ch they may
have served as cl appers).
I nform at ion 0 n act uali nterm e nt pr act ice sis 1e s s
complete. Many of the excavated sites are in soils which
apparently do not preserve burial pit outlines. At Floyd
Morri s, darker soi 1 around some of the buri als appeared
to reflect oval burial pits (Collins, Hester and Weir 1969:
124, 126). At 41WY50,'it was noted that the soil surrounding the interment was less compact than an oval area
bounding the burial. This suggests the probable presence
of an oval pit at 41WY50 also.
The general orientational properties of burials
in the region follow no consistent pattern. In his 1969
summary of buri al practi ces in the area, Hester notes
that orientation of the head at the Floyd Morris and
Ayal a si tes occurs toward all of the cardi nal di recti ons
(1969: 164). Another orientation, that of body position,
is more consistent. Almost all of the burials recorded in
this region are flexed. They lie on both the right and
the left side, however, and the individual from 41HG27
is reported to have been upright (Hester and Rodgers
1971: 367). Site 41WY50 is similarly anomalous; the
upper portion of the body lies on the right side while
the lower extremities appear to have been forced over the
body and displaced into a position on the left side (Fig.
34) .

"

Biological characteristics of human remains recovered from these sites are not well known. Osteological
analyses of much of the materi al are either mi nimal or
not reported. Determinations of age and sex are generally
available, however. Since these data have not been systematically collected and no cemetery populations have
been completely excavated, demographic assessments of
population age/sex distributions are not possible. Individuals of both sexes have been discovered from all age
categories.

are known from this area; these consist of the individual
from the Unland Site mentioned previously and three
individuals from the Floyd Morris Site. Report descriptions seem to indicate no unusual variation among this
gro up.
Tooth wear is not correlated, however, between
Burial B from the Unland Site and the individual from
41WY50. The former exhibits little or no tooth wear,
while the latter shows extensive wear of the occlusal
surfaces.
The stature of these two individuals is more
closely correlated. Burial B is assessed (from tibia
measurements) at a heigh~ of 160.32:t 3.27 centimeters
(Mallouf and Zavaleta 1979: 16) while the individual from
41WY50 is assessed from femur and humerus measurements
to have attained a height of between 163 and 166 centimeters.
Post-mortem human alteration of some skeletal
elements was apparently indicated on some"individuals
from the Floyd Morris Site. This feature does not appear
to be present at any of the other sites.
In summary, the burial at 41WY50 exhibits a number
of characteristics which link it to other burials from
the region. Particular correlations are noted with Burial
B from the Unland Site. A better understanding of this
probable burial complex in South Texas will be gained
through further systematic investigations of cemetery
sites and osteological analyses of their contents.

Faunal Analysis

Viola Rawn-Schatzinger

INTRODUCTION
The faunal materials collected during the archeological surveys in Hidalgo and Willacy counties. Texas, are
composed primarily of terrestrial vertebrates and both marine
and terrestrial invertebrates. Remains which appear to represent the time period prior to aboriginal occupation and
those which are modern in origin are identified in order to
delineate remains potentially associated with prehistoric
archeological remains. Forms which are no longer present in
the region include two species of extinct horse, one species
of microtine, and one species of bison. All other species
identified are included within the modern terrestrial and
marine fauna indigenous to the region. The shells of some of
the marine pelecypods and gastropods and some mammal bones
were modified by prehistoric peoples; it is also assumed that
many of these animals were used as food.
METHODS OF ANALYSIS
The comparative faunal collections of the Texas Memorial Museum Laboratory of Vertebrate Paleontology and the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of the University of
Texas at Austin were consulted for species identifications
during this study.
In addition, published sources were consulted for additional clarification and identification. Table
24 contains a list of the species identified. The specimens
are grouped first into invertebrates and vertebrates, then by
class, genus, and (where possible) species. Common names are
provided~where appropriate.
The number of specimens for each
species represents the total from all sites; the total number
of specimens exami ned is 2,697.
A much higher percentage of the invertebrates are
identified to species than are the vertebrates because of the
condition of the bones. Many bones are fragmentary and are
only assigned general animal size categories based on the
thickness of the fragment. Four size categories are used:
extra large (bone fragments of a thickness which suggests
animals as large as cow, horse or bison):, large (fragments
of the deer or large carnivore range), medium (carnivores in
the size range of coyote, bobcat or raccoon), and small (the
bones of rodents).
A major objective of this analysis is to determine
the relative ages of the faunal remains in order to aid "in
the dating of archeological sites in those areas where few
lithic remains were recovered. Further, the analysis
393

FAUNAL ANALYSIS

is intended to provide data regarding species which were
utilized by prehistoric peoples. Consequently, the materials collected are assigned to three broad temporal periods:
(1) late Pleistocene/early Holocene (approximately
10,000 years B.P. or older;
(2) Holocene (approximately 200 years to 10,000
years B.P.); and
(3) Modern (less than 200 years B.P.).
Estimates of age are based solely on the nature and
characteristics of each specimen. Five factors were utilized in arriving at thes~ estimates:
(1) species identification;
(2) extent of mineralization;
(3) extent of caliche patination;
(4) extent of weathering; and
(5) evidence of human use or alteration.
The preservation of bone and shell, which is dependent on hardness of the material and on the conditions
of burial, is highly selective. Mineralized bones and teeth
were rapidly buried by stream deposition and thus preserved
and fossilized as were many of the mineralized shells which
were observed on clay and sand dunes bordering Laguna Madre.
Moderate numbers of mammal bones are preserved even as
surface scatter; the bones of larger animals such as deer
are better preserved in open sites; only a .single turkey
bone was retrieved from the sites identified during the
survey. Bones of small reptiles and amphibians are uncommon except for the thick carapace fragments of the
Texas tortoise. Immediate burial such as occurred with the
human skeleton from site 41WY50 illustrates the difference
in preservation between rapidly buried bones and bones
which are scattered on the surface. Gastropods are frequently smaller and more fragile than pelecypods and
thus fewer are preserved over long periods of time. The
pelecypods are strong-shelled and tend to preserve well
even if they are broken into small fragments.

394

AGE OF FAUNAL ASSOCIATIONS

Specimens are assigned to the late Pleistocene/early
Holocene if one or more of the following conditions are met:
(1) the specimen represents an extinct species;
(2) heavy caliche patination is present; or
(3) the specimen is completely mineralized.

Assignment to Holocene age is made if the specimen
exhibits evidence of human utilization.
Specimens were identified as modern if:
(SOB

(1) the identification is of a modern species,
sp.), or

(2) the specimen is lightly weathered. Some of
the bones collected are clearly recent and show very few
signs of weathering or natural decay. This group includes
most of the small rodent, amphibian and reptile bones and
a few of the deer bones as well as the marine gastropods
discussed above,
(3) Specimens of bone and shell which show no
evidence of utilization but are not judged to be modern in
age are listed in the accompanying tables as Indeterminate.
Assessing the age of bone based on the degree of
weathering is a sUbjective process and many of the bones could
not be judged as Modern or Holocene solely on the degree
of weathering. The marine shells collected are somewhat
easier to separate on the basis of weathering since these
shells lose their color and become dull and partially
mineralized with age. A large number of the marine pelecy pod she 11s are dar ken edan d par t i all y ·m i nera 1i zed whi c h
suggests Holocene age. Most of the marine gastropods, on
the other hand, retain their color which suggests a mo~e
recent age. Table 25 lists the materials collected by site
and includes the species, the number of specimens and
suggested age.
AGE OF FAUNAL ASSOCIATIONS
The only major concentration of faunal material
from sites in Hidalgo County was recovered from 41HG96 where

395

FAUNAL ANALYSIS

materials were collected from surface exposures and subsurface excavations. The faunal association, represented
by numerous snail shells and mammal bones, is entirely
terrestrial. Many of the Rabdotus aZternatus shells are
covered with caliche which suggests they are Holocene in
age. The only identifiable mammal bones are Modern (Procyon Zotor,and Bos tarus).
Bos tarus is also represented
at an additional site, 41HG39. The material from 41HG96
consists of fragments of large mammal bones, turtle bones,
a few rattlesnake vertebrae and snails. One culturally
associated marine gastropod (Prunum apicinum) is represented at 41HG89 and is assigned to the Holocene.
A greater amount and variety of faunal material was
collected from thirteen sites and one isolated ftnd in
Willacy County. Sites 41WY47, 41WY48, 41WY52, 41WY59, 41WY61,
41WY62, 41WY63, 41WY67 and 41WY70 contain marine gastropods
and pelecypods which have lost their color and are partially
or wholly mineralized and indicate a Holocene or late
Pleistocene age. Gastropods and pelecypods from sites
41WY47, 41WY50, 41WY51, 41WY52, 41WY59, 41WY60, 41WY61,
41WY74, 41WY77 and IFHW15(WY) show partial mineralization,
discoloration and modification, or were found in a cultural
context which suggests a Holocene or late Pleistocene age.
Bone which is heavily mineralized, and thus assumed
to be of late Pleistocene/early Holocene age, was recovered
from sites 41WY61, 41WY62, 41WY63, 41WY65 and an isolated
find, IFHW11(WY). Two extinct species of horse (Equus sp.)
were recovered. During the Pleistocene several species
of horses (Equus spp.) were widespread in North America,
but more complete specimens are requlred in order to determine the exact species represented. Several human bones
(Homo sapiens), which also show partial mineralization,
that were collected from site 41WY67 suggest a Holocene
age.
UTILIZATION
Culturally modified bones were found at sites
41WY50 (3) and 41WY76 (1) (parentheses indicate number
of specimens). The specimen from site 41WY76 is a fragment of a limbbone of a large mammal modified for an unknown purpose. Two of the bones from 41WY50 fit together
to form a long slender highly modified piece of bone associated with Burial 1 that is presumably an ornament (see

396

FOOD UTILIZATION

Artifact Analysis, Appendix V). The morphological characteristics indicate this bone is from a deer (Odocoileus
virgininianus).
The third modified fragment of bone is
from an unidentified mammal and appears to be a small
fragment of a larger piece of bone (see Artifact Analysis,
Appendix V, Modified Bone for descriptions).
Unmodified bones, recovered in association with
Burial 1 at site 4IWY50 include two matched upper incisors
of a coyote (Canis latrans) and eighteen canid premolar
and molar fragments. No other coyote bones are associated
with the burial. Some rodent bones found in association
with the burial are recent intrusive elements.
Eleven utilized specimens of shell recovered during
the survey, which include both pelecypod and gastropod
shells, are discussed in the Artifact Analysis, Appendix
V, and are summarized in Table 25. Modified or utilized
shells were collected from sites 4IHG89 (1), 4IWY50 (1),
4IWY5I (2), 4IWY52 (1), 4IWY59 (1), 4IW~60 (1), 4IWY6I (1),
4IWY74 (1), 4IWY77 (1) and IFHWI5 (WY) (1); the species
identified include common Atlantic marginella (Prunum
apicinam), Sunray Venus clam (Macrocallista nimbosa),
Atlantic Bay scallop ((Aequipecten irradians), unidentified
whelk (Busycon sp.), Lettered olive (golden form) (Oliva
sayana), Florida lucine (Lucina floridana), and Perverse
whelk (Busycon perversum).
FOOD UTILIZATION
Many of the marine pelecypods and gastropods of
Holocene and late Pleistocene/early Holo·cene age are
edible species. One of the whelk shells·:·collected shows
evidence of having been broken to extract the animal, and
the numerous clams and scallops could have provided nutrition for the aboriginal population. The smaller marine
gastropods collected are modern and show no signs of
removal of the animal; the terrestrial gastropods, particularly Rabdotus alternatus, are very common throughout
the area and today may be found in the millions in
cultivated fields. Fullington (1979) notes that Rabdotus
is a scavenger attracted to human garbage and suggests that

397

FAUNAL ANALYSIS

•

its occurrence at large archeological sites may be useful
in correlating periods of occupation and abandonment .
Among the vertebrates, deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
which is a potentially important food source, is the most
common species represented. Specimens were recovered from
nine sites in Willacy County. Many of the bones are
heavily fractured and in at least three instances (from
41WY62 and 41WY66) suggest green or spiral fractures which
are commonly attributed to human manipulation of fresh bone.
Other vertebrate species which might have contributed to
the aboriginal diet are the jackrabbit (Lepus californicus),
Texas tortoise (Copherus berlandieri), Bison bison and
the freshwater drum Apolodinatus grumniens.
The freshwater drum is a large fish. which reaches 3 to 4 feet in
length and provides a large quantity of meat per animal.
Unfortunately, it is not possjble to positively determined
if the drum and deer are modern or Holocene.
BURNED BONE
Small quantities of the bone materials collected
are burned; these include five fragments from sites in
Willacy County which are burned to an ashy grey color and
nineteen bone fragments from site 41HG96 in Hidalgo
County which are burned black. None of the shell materials
exhibit evidence of burning.
COMPARISON TO MODERN FAUNA
With the exception of the two extin~t horse species,
one rodent species and the bison, the faunaJ. materials
collected during the present survey are comparable with
modern terrestrial and marine faunas in Willacy and Hidalgo
counties and the nearshore Laguna Madre environments.
Although the species identified do not resemble the total
modern association, they are common members of the regional
fauna. The species within the faunal collection and their
relative abundance reflects abundance in nature, the potential for preservation, sampling procedures, and, in
some instances, the cultural preferences of the aboriginal
population. Three modern species which were observed during

398

COMPARISON TO MODERN FAUNA

the survey are not present in the faunal collections. One
of these is live Red wolf (Canis rufus) which was noted in
western Willacy County, the second is a dead jaguarundi
(Felis yagouaroundi) which was observed on one of the clay
dunes of the Laguna Madre and the third is a small group
of live peccary (Dicotylas tajacu) which was observed
in eastern Willacy County on the El Sauz Ranch (Davis
1974: 116-117, 136, 246-247).
The discovery

of an isolated left mandible of

Microtus ludovicianus, which is known only from small Holo-

cene samples from southwestern Louisiana and Hardin County
in southeast Texas (Hall and Kelson 1959), on.the clay
dunes near Laguna Madre in Willacy County is df some interest. No microtines have extant ranges in a large portion
of southern and eastern Texas; however, recent information
suggests that Microtus ludovicianus had a relict population
extending along the Texas coast during the Holocene.
In
addition to the Willacy County find, evidence for Microtus ludovicianus exists from San Patricio County
(Lundelius 1980; Raun 1980) and from Goiiad County (Hulburt 1980) where the finds date from 400 B.P. (San Patricio
County) to 700-1200 B.P. (Goliad County). The mandible
collected during the present survey is highly weathered
and does not appear to be modern. The distance between the
extant population in east Texas and Louisiana and Willacy
County is approximately 525 kilometers (325 miles) which
suggest a retreat northward along the coast during the
Holocene. Many microtine rodents retreated into more
northern climates at the close of the Pleistocene and
the absence of microtines in large parts of Texas may be
attributed to the unsuitably dry and warm conditons which
have prevailed since that time. The presence of Microtus
ludovicianus in Willacy County demonstrates a considerable
range extension both for the species and. for the family
of microtine rodents during the late Holocene.
CONCLUSIONS
The faunal materials collected during the archeological survey in portions of Hidalgo and Willacy counties,
Texas, contain evidence of use as tools, ornaments and
food by prehistoric peoples during the Holocene. Both the
terrestrial and the marine species which were collected
reflect common species within the local faunal population
as well as species which were preferred by the aboriginal
399

inhabitants including deer, clams, scallops and whelks.
Species which are not found in the region at the present
time include two species of extinct horse (Equus spp.),
Microtus Zudovicianus and Bison bison.
The two horse
species are felt to be late Pleistocene in age while the
microtine species reflects a probable relict population
which retreated northward along the Texas coast during
the late Holocene. The bison are Holocene in age. While
there are no indications of the precise time during the
Holocene that these animals were present in the region,
it is probable that this event coincides either with
Dillehay's (1974: 182-185) Presence Period II (4,500
to 1,500 B.P.) or Presence Period III (700 to 400 B.P.).

APPENDIX VI II
Radiocarbon Dating

Elton R. Pr!'?witt

RADIOCARBON DATING
A single radiocarbon sample collected during the
surveys and assessments in Hidalgo and Willacy counties,
Texas, was submitted to the Radiocarbon Laboratory,
Balcones Research Center, The University of Texas at
Austin. The sample consists of human bones which were
selected from the skeletal materials of Burial 1 excavated
from site 41WY50 (see Appendix IV for a description of
the site, Appendix V for a description of the associated
artifacts, and Appendix VI for a description of skeletal
remains).
Sample Tx-4256 yielded an assay of 540 ± 110
radiocarbon years B.P. (Before Present) calculated on
a 14C half-life of 5,568 years (Valastro 1981). This
places the age of the inhumation within the late prehistoric
Neo-Archaic Stage (A.D. 1410 ± 110) and just prior to the
i niti al European contacts along the southern Texas coast
which occurred during the early sixteenth century.
No previously reported radiocarbon assays dealing
with archeological materials in the Rio Grande Delta region
are known although assays rel ati ng to geologi cal deposi ts
have been obtained in efforts to study the history of the
Laguna Madre and the coastal barrier islands (Pearson,
Davis, Tamers and Johnston 1965: 298-299; Pearson, Davis
and Tamers 1966: 456-457; Valastro and Davis 1970a: 250251; Valastro and Davis 1970b: 617-622; Valastro, Davis
and Varela 1972: 462-468; Valastro, Davis and Varela 1975:
66-67; and Valastro, Davis and Varela 1977: 280-283). A
series of dates obtained from La Paloma Ranch in northwestern Kenedy County ranges from about 9,000 to 10,000
years B.P.; however, these assays are from extinct Pleistocene fauna which are of dubious association with early
man on the Rio Grande Plain (Valastro, Davis and Varela
1979: 257-258).
The nearest unquestionably arcneologically associated assay is from the Hinojosa Sitetn northern Jim
Wells County near Alice; a date of 580 ± 50 B.P. (Tx-2207)
was obtained from a charcoal sample associated with Perdiz
arrow points, ceramics and bison bones (Valastro, Davis
and Varela 1977: 303; Hester 1977: 27). This indicates
contemporaneity between the two adjacent areas; however.,
the cultural expressions at the Hinojosa Site are more
related to the Neo-Archaic Austin Phase of Central Texas
than they are to the Rio Grande Delta. Other dates from
the Rio Grande Plain include two from the Tortuga Flat
Site (41ZV155) near Crystal City (Tx-15l4, 170 ± 60 B.P.
and Tx-15l5, 410 ± 60 B.P.), and one each from 41ZV83

413

RADIOCARBON DATING

(Tx-1526, 430 ± 60 B.P.) and 41ZV82 (Tx-1527, 500 ± 70
B.P.). All of these sites are in Zavala County and are
related to cultural expressions in the northern portion
of the Rio Grande Plain which are rather far removed
from the Delta region (Valastro, Davis and Varela 1977:
303- 305) .
Perhaps the most significant date which has been
reported is a single assay obtained from charcoal at the
Ingleside Cove Site (41SP43) just north of Corpus Christi.
Sample Tx-520 yielded a date of 780 ± 40 B.P. and is felt
to slightly predate the Rockport Phase (Valastro, Davis
and Rightmire 1968: 394-395; Story 1968: 40). Minor
quantities of possible Rockport ware ceramics occur in
the Rio Grande Delta, and although none are known specifically from 41WY50, four small sherds were recovered
from another nearby clay dune site, 41WY60. This may
lend some credence to speculations that there may be
cultural ties between the Rockport Phase and the late
prehistoric expressions along the coast of the Rio Grande
Delta. Certainly the age estimates between the two areas
are compatible.
While it is dangerous to speculate on the basis
of a single date for an entire region, the correlation
of the data obtained from 41WY50 merits additional thought.
Guesses regarding the age ranges of the burials and most
of the artifact assemblages in the Rio Grande Delta have
consistently fallen within the late prehistoric era. It
is significant that the assay of 540 ± 110 B.P. is quite
compatible with these previous estimates. Further, if
the suggestions of relative contemporaneity of the several
burial sites discussed in the preceding Appendix VI are
correct, then this assay represents the beginnings of
precise chronological controls for the Rio Grande Delta.
