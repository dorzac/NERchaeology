MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was contracted by Bio-West, Inc. (BioWest), to conduct a cultural resources survey in support of permitting activities for the proposed
Koios CDP 12.0-Inch-Diameter Pipeline Project in Midland County, Texas. The proposed project
would involve installing approximately 0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile) of pipeline on a tract of land owned
by the City of Midland. The construction corridor would measure no more than 30.5 meters
(100.0 feet) in width, and the overall project would cover an area of approximately 2.5 hectares
(6.1 acres). The proposed pipeline would be installed via open-cut trenching.
The project is being sponsored by a private oil and gas developer on a parcel of land
owned by the City of Midland, a political subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project
would fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. At this time, no federal permits,
funding, or licenses have been identified for the project. As the proposed project represents a
publicly sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor is required to provide the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state
of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on the project’s potential to adversely affect
historic properties listed on or considered eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
On May 29, 2019, Horizon archeologist Jesse Dalton, under the supervision of Principal
Investigator Jeffrey D. Owens, conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the project
area to locate any cultural resources that would potentially be impacted by the proposed pipeline
construction. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the archeological survey area on foot and
thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. The survey area was relatively flat to gently sloping with sparse desert scrub and
grasses typical of the Permian Basin. Ground surface visibility was generally excellent, ranging
from 50 to 100%. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8936.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) for linear projects require excavation of 16 shovel tests per mile per 30.5meter- (100.0-foot-) wide segment of proposed right-of-way (ROW) or fraction thereof. As such,
a minimum of eight shovel tests would be required within the 0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long project
area. Horizon excavated eight shovel tests, thereby meeting this standard. Shovel testing
revealed reddish-brown sandy loam and frequently encountered gravel or calcareous inclusions

Management Summary

at a depth of 20.0 centimeters (7.9 inches) below surface. It is Horizon’s opinion that shovel
testing was capable of fully penetrating sediments with the potential to contain prehistoric and
historic-age cultural resources.
No cultural resources, prehistoric or historic-age, were observed on the modern ground
surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated within the project area. Based on the results
of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no potentially significant cultural
resources would be affected by the proposed pipeline project. No cultural resources were
identified that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon
recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further archeological work is
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both
prehistoric and historic-age, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event
that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas,
all work should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified
of the discovery. Following completion of the project, project records will be prepared for
permanent curation at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was contracted by Bio-West, Inc. (BioWest), to conduct a cultural resources survey in support of permitting activities for the proposed
Koios CDP 12.0-Inch-Diameter Pipeline Project in Midland County, Texas. The proposed project
would involve installing approximately 0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile) of pipeline on a tract of land owned
by the City of Midland (Figures 1 to 3). The construction corridor would measure no more than
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width, and the overall project would cover an area of approximately
2.5 hectares (6.1 acres). The proposed pipeline would be installed via open-cut trenching.
The project is being sponsored by a private oil and gas developer on a parcel of land
owned by the City of Midland, a political subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project
would fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. At this time, no federal permits,
funding, or licenses have been identified for the project. As the proposed project represents a
publicly sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor is required to provide the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state
of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on the project’s potential to adversely affect
historic properties listed on or considered eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
On May 29, 2019, Horizon archeologist Jesse Dalton, under the supervision of Principal
Investigator Jeffrey D. Owens, conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the project
area to locate any cultural resources that would potentially be impacted by the proposed pipeline
construction. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8936. The cultural
resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive archeological survey of the
project area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26,
Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources
Management Reports.

cultural backgrounds, respectively, of the project area. Chapter 4.0 describes the results of
background archival research, and Chapter 5.0 discusses archeological survey methods.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located southeast of the City of Midland within an area of mostly flat to
gently undulating desert hills scattered with playa basins (see Figures 1 to 3). The surrounding
land is used mostly for oil and gas prospection and production as well as rangeland. Elevations
throughout the project area range from 789.4 to 807.7 meters (2,590 to 2,650.0 feet) above mean
sea level (amsl), with elevations gradually increasing from north to south. No natural water bodies
are located within the project area. Johnson Draw passes approximately 0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile)
north of the project area, and the project area traverses two prominent upland landforms.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the project area is underlain by the Pleistocene-age Blackwater Draw
Formation, which is primarily composed of unconsolidated coarse sand (USGS 2019b).
Sediments within the project area generally consist of loamy eolian deposits derived from the
underlying Blackwater Draw Formation (Figure 4; Table 1). No Holocene-age alluvial sediments
are mapped within the project area.
In West Texas, aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered on alluvial flats
and terraces adjacent to prominent streams, washes, and playas, as well as in upland settings.
The relative antiquity of the upland setting suggests that any aboriginal cultural resources that
may be present within the project area would be constrained to the modern ground surface and/or
in shallowly buried contexts in erosional settings lacking integrity and depth.
Historic-age cultural resources may be present in virtually any physiographic setting,
though they are most common in urban areas and in rural settings suitable for agriculture. The
relative remoteness of the project area from any historical population centers and the absence of
standing structures on modern aerial imagery and on historical US Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic maps and aerial photographs suggests that the project area has a low potential for
historic-age architectural and/or archeological resources.

2.3

CLIMATE

The climate of Midland County is semiarid. Winters are mild, with an average temperature
of 46.2 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average temperature of

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all of TransPecos Texas except for the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950). Blair (1950) notes that portions
of Culberson and the surrounding counties were once part of an old bolson now drained by the
Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the Chihuahuan Deserts
ecoregion, the project area is situated on geological formations composed of sand sheet and
caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant communities dominate the Chihuahuan
Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland.
The dominant species associated with the saline flats and alkaline playa margins plant community
include Atriplex canescens (fourwing saltbush), Suaeda spp. (seepweed), Salicornia spp.
(pickleweed), and Sporobolus airoides (alkali sacaton). The dominant species associated with
the gypsum land plant community include Bouteloua breviseta (gypsum grama), Mentzelia spp.
(blazingstar), and Ephedra torreyana (Torrey’s jointfir). The dominant species associated with
the desert shrubland plant community include Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), Flourensia
cernua (American tarwort), Yucca spp. (yucca), Artemisia filifolia (sand sagebrush), Acacia
rigidula (blackbrush acacia), Cylindropuntia leptocaulis (Christmas cactus), Agave lechuguilla
(lechuguilla), and Leucophyllum frutescens (cenizo) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Southern High Plains archeological region as defined
by Perttula (2004:7); however, it is also closely bordered by the Trans-Pecos and Central Texas
archeological regions. The cultural history of the Southern High Plains is typically divided into six
cultural periods: PaleoIndian (11,500 to 8500 B.P.), Archaic (8500 to 2000 B.P.), Ceramic (2000
to 500 B.P.), Protohistoric (500 top 300 B.P.), and Historic (300 B.P. to present) (Johnson and
Holliday 2004).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,500 TO 8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is well represented on the Southern Hight Plains, both from
surface finds and buried, in situ sites along draws and playa lakes. The PaleoIndian climate was
generally cooler and wetter than it is today and supported megafauna such as horse, camel,
bison, and mammoth (Johnson and Holliday 2004). Small bands of nomadic gatherers and
hunters exploited these megafauna as well as smaller game and locally available plant resources.
Technologically, this time period is represented by fluted lanceolate dart points that would have
been used in atlatls. The earliest of these was the ubiquitous Clovis point, followed by Folsom
less than 1,000 years later. During the Late PaleoIndian period (ca. 10,000 to 8500 B.P.) a variety
of unfluted lanceolate styles developed such as Plainview, Firstview, Lubbock, and Midland
(Johnson and Holliday 2004). By the end of the PaleoIndian period, the climate had become
warmer and drier and vegetation shifted to more scrub-grassland and short grassland, similar to
today’s climate (Holliday 1997). Archeologists believe that warmer and drier climatic conditions
coupled with the extinction of megafauna caused a shift in PaleoIndian subsistence strategies.
This shift marked the end of the PaleoIndian period and the beginning of the Archaic period.
The Midland, or Scharbauer, site (41MD1) is a PaleoIndian period site located
approximately 24.1 kilometers (15.0 miles) northwest of the project area. The site was first
discovered in 1953 within the sand dunes and dune blowouts along the northern side of Monahans
Draw. The chronology of the site, specifically the age of the human remains first found at the site,
have long been debated, but the site most likely dates to 10,000 B.P. or later (Holliday and Meltzer
1996). The thin, unfluted lanceolate points from the site became the type collection for Midland
points (Martinez 2010).

H011-190105

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 2000 B.P.)

Little is known about the Early Archaic period (ca. 8500 to 6500 B.P.) on the Southern
High Plains. Paleoenvironmental evidence from the Lubbock Lake and San Jon sites indicate
that warming and drying trends of the terminal PaleoIndian period continued, and seasonality
intensified. Eolian sedimentation also increased (Johnson and Holliday 2004). The Middle
Archaic Period (6500 to 4500 B.P.) corresponds to the Hypsithermal, a period of very hot and dry
conditions. On the Southern High Plains, humans adapted to this climactic shift in part by digging
wells to reach a significantly lower water table. At the Mustang Springs Site, approximately
32.2 kilometers (20.0 miles) northeast of Midland, more than 60 such wells were found dating to
the Middle Archaic period (Meltzer 1991). By the Late Archaic period (4500 to 2000 B.P.), the
climate became cooler and wetter again, and sedimentation decreased (Johnson and Holliday
2004).
Throughout the Archaic period, groups of mobile gatherer-hunters continued to exploit
large game such as bison, though hunting technology had shifted from lanceolate points to cornerand side-notched triangular dart points. The Archaic also marked the onset of what Alston Thoms
has dubbed “The Carbohydrate Revolution” (2008). Beginning in the early Holocene, humans
living throughout the southern Plains began using rock heating elements to create earth ovens
used to bake plants, specifically geophytes, which are not edible to humans unless they are
cooked.

3.3

CERAMIC PERIOD (CA. 2000 TO 500 B.P.)

The Ceramic period on the Southern High Plains began with the adaptation of new
technologies, namely, pottery and the bow and arrow. Some sites in the region have both Archaic
dart points and early arrow points within the same stratigraphic context, suggesting a slow
transition away from traditional Archaic lifeways (Johnson and Holliday 2004). Hallmarks of this
early Ceramic period are Scallorn arrow points and coarse-tempered, cord-marked pottery that
was locally produced. By the late Ceramic period (ca. 1000 to 500 B.P.) Puebloan trade pottery,
specifically Mogollon ceramics, dominate assemblages (Johnson and Holliday 2004).

3.4

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 500 TO 300 B.P.)

The Protohistoric period (ca. 500 to 300 B.P.) encompasses the era of initial contact
between indigenous groups and early European explorers. During much of this time, traditional
hunting and gathering, bison hunting, and agricultural pursuits continued with varying degrees of
intensity throughout the eastern Trans-Pecos, Central Texas, and the Texas Southern High
Plains. Garza arrow points are typically associated with protohistoric sites in the Southern High
Plains (Johnson and Holliday 2004); however, it was also during this time that aboriginal groups
began to be affected by the Spanish mission system, European material culture (especially
horses), and European diseases.

3.5

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 300 B.P. TO PRESENT)

Prior to permanent settlement of Euro-Americans in Midland County, Comanche, Kiowa,
and Kiowa-Apache tribes lived in and travelled through the area hunting buffalo herds across the
Southern High Plains. Beginning in the 1830s, Mexican and American travelers began building
roads that crossed through present-day Midland County. In the 1870s, American buffalo hunters
came to the region, decimating the herds (Leffler 2010a). The City of Midway was established in
1881 by the Texas and Pacific Railway as it built its line from El Paso to Dallas (Leffler 2010b). It
was not until 1882 that the first permanent Anglo-American settler, Herman Garrett, settled on
Mustang Draw and began a sheep ranch. Other sheep ranchers soon followed; by 1885,
300 people were living in the newly established Midland County (Leffler 2010a). Cattle soon took
over as the dominant livestock in the county once wells were dug to provide water for the herds.
During the first few decades of the 1900s, Midland’s economy was focused on cattle
ranching and, to a lesser extent, cotton farming. Discovery of oil in neighboring counties in the
1920s led to an oil boom, and many oil companies set up their headquarters in Midland. Oil also
drew people to the County, which had a population of 8,500 by 1930 (Leffler 2010b). A boom in
Midland County oil wells in the 1940s and 1950s brought continued economic prosperity to the
region. The oil and gas industry continues to be a major source of revenue and employment in
Midland County today.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon performed background archival research on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database (Atlas) for information on previously recorded
cultural resources sites and historic properties in and near the project area as well as previous
cultural resources investigations conducted in the vicinity of the project area. Based on this
archival research, one known archeological site and one previous archeological survey fall within
a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the project area (Table 2; Figure 5) (THC 2019). Site 41MD36
is a late 19th- to early 20th-century farmstead located approximately 0.6 kilometer (0.4 mile)
southwest of the project area. When it was recorded in 1992, building footing stones, a cistern,
a windmill, and dozens of glass, ceramic, and construction-related artifacts were found on the
modern ground surface. The site was recorded during a cultural resources survey of the CRMWD
Ivie Midland Pipeline (THC 2019).
In addition to the Atlas, historical maps and aerial photographs were also consulted to
check for historic structures within the project area (NETR 2019). US Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic maps dating from 1954 to present and aerial photographs dating from 1954 to present
show no evidence of historic-age standing structures within the project area since at least the
mid-20th century (NETR 2019; USGS 2019a; UT 2019).

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

Horizon archeologist Jesse Dalton completed the intensive survey of the project area on
May 29, 2019. This entailed surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the project
area. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum
16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width. As
the project area measures 0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile) in length, a minimum of eight shovel tests were
necessary within the project area to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon excavated eight shovel
tests within the project area, thereby meeting the TSMASS standards (Figure 6).
All shovel tests measured approximately 30.5 centimeters (12.0 inches) in diameter and
were excavated in arbitrary 10.0-centimeter (3.9-inch) levels. All excavated shovel test matrices
were screened through quarter-inch hardware mesh. Field notes were maintained on terrain,
vegetation, soils, landforms, shovel tests, and cultural material observed (if any). Standardized
shovel test forms were completed for every shovel test. Standard shovel test logs were completed
for each shovel test describing the location, strata, soil texture and color, archeological materials
(if present), and any unusual characteristics of the surrounding landscape. All sediments
excavated from shovel tests were replaced in the shovel test hole upon completion of recording.
The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of each shovel test were determined using
hand-held Garmin Foretrex or eTrex Global Positioning System (GPS) devices using the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Specific shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel testing and backhoe trenching results. Digital photographs were
taken, and a photographic log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for
cultural resources. Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with
maker’s marks) and non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and
metal scrap) were to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced
in the same location in which they were found. As no cultural materials were observed during the
survey, the collection policy was not brought into play. All project records will ultimately be curated
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) following completion of the project.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 CFR
800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

On May 29, 2019, Horizon archeologist Jesse Dalton, under the direction of Jeffrey D.
Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resources survey of the project
area to locate any cultural resources that could potentially be impacted by the proposed pipeline.
Horizon’s archeologist traversed the archeological survey area on foot and thoroughly inspected
the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The survey area
consisted of mostly flat, open ground covered in sparse grasses with occasional mesquite trees
and cacti (Figure 7). Ground surface visibility was generally excellent, ranging from 50 to 100%.
Although nearby ground disturbance from pipeline construction was evident, the project area itself
did not appear to be disturbed other than potential impacts from cattle ranching and ongoing
erosion.
In addition to pedestrian walkover and surface inspection, eight shovel tests were
excavated along the 0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long proposed pipeline ROW; none contained
cultural materials. A typical soil profile consisted of reddish-brown sandy loam to an average
depth of 30.0 centimeters (11.8 inches) below surface underlain by reddish-brown sandy loam
with a high gravel content or bedrock. In some areas, gravels were present beginning on the
modern ground surface (Figure 8). It is Horizon’s opinion that shovel testing was capable of fully
penetrating sediments with the potential to contain prehistoric and historic-age cultural resources.
No cultural resources were observed on the modern ground surface or within any of the
shovel tests excavated within the survey area.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or federal
codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a
function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs, though
historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important historic events
and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources
are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological
resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs, respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The four criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by three requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least one of the four criteria for eligibility listed
above, and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As
discussed here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory
and history according to various periods of development in various times and at various places.
Thus, the significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic
development and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular
period of development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding
of prehistory. All four criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought
to bear for historic sites.

7.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

H011-190105

23

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

7.4

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

On May 29, 2019, Horizon archeologist Jesse Dalton, under the supervision of Principal
Investigator Jeffrey D. Owens, conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the project
area to locate any cultural resources that would potentially be impacted by the proposed pipeline
construction. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the archeological survey area on foot and
thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. The survey area was relatively flat to gently sloping with sparse desert scrub and
grasses typical of the Permian Basin. Ground surface visibility was generally excellent, ranging
from 50 to 100%.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the TSMASS for linear projects require excavation of
16 shovel tests per mile per 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide segment of proposed right-of-way
(ROW) or fraction thereof. As such, a minimum of eight shovel tests would be required within the
0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long project area. Horizon excavated eight shovel tests, thereby
meeting this standard. Shovel testing revealed reddish-brown sandy loam that frequently
encountered gravel or calcareous inclusions at a depth of 20.0 centimeters (7.9 inches) below
surface. It is Horizon’s opinion that shovel testing was capable of fully penetrating sediments with
the potential to contain prehistoric and historic-age cultural resources.
No cultural resources, prehistoric or historic-age, were observed on the modern ground
surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated within the survey area.

7.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed project. No cultural resources,
prehistoric or historic-age, were observed on the modern ground surface or within any of the
shovel tests excavated within the project area. Based on the results of the survey-level

24

investigations documented in this report, no potentially significant cultural resources would be
affected by the proposed pipeline project. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no
historic properties affected,” and no further archeological work is recommended in connection
with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic-age, are
protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or
burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately and the THC should be notified of the discovery. Following completion of the project,
project records will be prepared for permanent curation at TARL.
