A Cultural Resources Investigation for the
Bryant G to Midland Pipeline Project, Midland County, Texas

ABSTRACT
This report details the results of an intensive archaeological survey by SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) for the proposed Bryant G to Midland Pipeline, Midland County, Texas. Enterprise Crude Pipeline
LLC proposes to install approximately 25.7 km (16 miles) of pipeline, approximately 3.2 km (2 miles) of
which cross lands managed by the City of Midland. The pipeline lateral would be constructed within a 21.3m (70 foot) right-of-way corridor, 9.1 m (30 feet) of which comprise the permanent right-of-way and 12.2
m (40 feet) of which comprise the temporary right-of-way. The construction activities would take place
within a corridor ranging between 21.3 and 30.5 m (70â100 feet) wide in areas with additional temporary
workspace needed in some locations. Depths of impact are anticipated to range from 0.9 to 1.5 m (3â5 feet).
In all, the survey area (crossing City of Midland lands) totals approximately 17 acres.
SWCA conducted an archaeological survey of the project area to aid in complying with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act. This report documents the findings resulting from a pedestrian survey
of the City of Midland portion of the project area (referred to as the survey area).
The background literature review determined that no cultural resources have been identified within the
project area or within a 1.6-km (1-mile) radius of the project area (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas 2017).
SWCA archaeologists Kevin Pintz and Courtney Blair surveyed the proposed project area in Texas and
identified no cultural resources. Based on these findings, SWCA recommends a finding of no historic
properties affected for the proposed project. No further archaeological work is recommended. However, if
previously undocumented or buried cultural resources are identified during ground-disturbing activities, all
work in the immediate vicinity of the discovery should stop until the find can be evaluated by a professional
archaeologist.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
Enterprise Crude Pipeline LLC proposes to install approximately 27.5 km (16 miles) of pipeline,
approximately 3.2 km (2 miles) of which cross lands managed by the City of Midland. The pipeline lateral
would be constructed within a 21.3-m (70 foot) right-of-way corridor, 9.1 m (30 feet) of which comprise
the permanent right-of-way and 12.2 m (40 feet) of which comprise the temporary right-of-way. The
construction activities would take place within a corridor ranging between 21.3 and 30.5 m (70â100 feet)
wide in areas with additional temporary workspace needed in some locations. Depths of impact are
anticipated to range from 0.9 to 1.5 m (3â5 feet). In all, the survey area (crossing City of Midland lands)
totals approximately 17 acres (Figure 1 and Figure 2).
All surveys occurred on lands managed by the City of Midland in Midland County, Texas. The project area
can be found on the U.S. Geological Survey Southeast Midland (31102-H1) and Northeast Midland (32102A1) 7.5-minute quadrangles. The majority of the project area has been disturbed by agricultural activity.

PROJECT METHODS AND RESULTS
Background Review
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) performed a cultural resources file records review on January
4, 2017, to determine whether the project area has been previously surveyed for cultural resources and
whether any archaeological sites have been recorded in or near the project area. To conduct this review,
Kimberly Parker reviewed the U.S. Geological Survey Southeast Midland (31102-H1) and Northeast
Midland (32102-A1) 7.5-minute quadrangles at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and
searched the Texas Historical Commission Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) database and site files
at TARL. These sources provide information on the nature and location of previously conducted
archaeological surveys, previously recorded cultural resource sites, locations of National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) properties, sites designated as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs), Official
Texas Historical Markers, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood
surveys.

Background Review Results
The background literature review determined that no cultural resources have been identified within the
project area or within a 1.6-km (1-mile) radius of the project area (Atlas 2017). Previously conducted
investigations and known cultural resources are visible in Figure 8 below.

Field Survey Methods
The goal of the archaeological survey was to locate all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites in the
defined area of potential effects (APE), establish horizontal site boundaries as appropriate, and evaluate the
significance and eligibility of any sites recorded for designation as an SAL. This survey was conducted as
an intensive pedestrian survey with 100 percent ground coverage. The survey area covers the APE, which
predominantly consists of a 21.3-m-wide (70-foot-wide) corridor, extending to 30.5 m (100 feet) wide in
areas with additional temporary workspace. In all, the survey area (crossing City of Midland lands) totals
approximately 17 acres (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). The survey was conducted at 15-m (50-foot) intervals
in parallel transects within the project area. Temporally diagnostic artifacts, if present, were to be described
in detail and photographed in the field. Only especially rare artifacts or discoveries were to be collected.
Shovel tests were placed in areas with surface visibility of less than 30 percent and in setting that have
potential for buried cultural materials. Shovel tests are at least 30 cm in diameter, dug in levels of 20 cm,
and screened through Â¼-inch mesh.

Field Survey Results
Investigations of the survey area adjacent to Midland Draw were conducted by Kevin Pintz on October 17,
2016 as part of the requirements for a flood zone permit application. Subsequent to that survey, SWCA
became aware that an Antiquities Permit would be required for projects on City of Midland lands. The THC
was immediately contacted and Antiquities Permit number 7887 was issued. The full extent of the project
area crossing City of Midland lands was investigated .by Kevin Pintz and Courtney Blair on January 12,
2017. The project area shows ongoing disturbance from agricultural activities and oil and gas construction
and development. In addition to these disturbances, previous pipeline construction have also impacted the
project area.

General survey conditions were good; overall ground visibility averaged 40 percent and ranged between 0
and 80 percent. Survey conditions within the project area are illustrated in Figure 3 through Figure 7.
Vegetation within the project area included grasses, mesquite, shrubs, and forbs. In total, 22 shovel tests
were placed along the centerline of the project area, predominantly within agricultural fields with heavy
grass cover and the flood zone adjacent to Midland Draw (Figure 9). Data collected during shovel tests are
presented in Table 1. All shovel tests were negative for cultural resources.

PROJECT SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In support of the Bryant G to Midland Pipeline Project, SWCA conducted a cultural resources survey of
the proposed project area in Midland County, Texas. The project is subject to review under Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (16 United States Code 470) and its implementing regulations (36
Code of Federal Regulations 800). The work was performed to determine whether the proposed use of the
area would affect significant cultural resources. The archaeological investigation included an
archaeological background records review and an intensive pedestrian survey.
The background literature review determined that no cultural resources have been identified within a 1.6km (1-mile) radius of the project area (Atlas 2017). During the SWCA field investigation, no new
archaeological sites were encountered. SWCA recommends a finding of no historic properties affected for
the proposed Bryant G to Midland Pipeline Project. No further archaeological work is recommended for
the project area. However, if previously undocumented buried cultural resources are identified during
ground-disturbing activities, all work in the immediate vicinity of the discovery should stop until the find
can be evaluated by a professional archaeologist.
