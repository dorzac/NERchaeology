MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the months of May and July 2007, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of 12 Cathodic Protection Beds
(CPBs) along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn) pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in
Travis, Blanco, Gillespie, Mason, Crockett, Reagan, and Culberson counties, Texas. Horizon
conducted the cultural resources survey on behalf of Longhorn and Magellan Pipeline
Company, L.P. (Magellan), the contract operator for Longhorn. The investigations on privately
held lands were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, while the investigations on lands under the control of the
University of Texas (UT Lands) were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA as
well as the Antiquities Code of Texas. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were present and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or for formal designation as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The investigations on UT Lands were conducted under
Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit No. 4594.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the 12 CPBs resulted in entirely negative
findings. No prehistoric or historic-age cultural materials were observed at any of the 12
locations. If any cultural materials had been present, they would have been confined to surface
contexts by the exposed limestone bedrock or shallow, gravelly clay deposits prevalent along
the ROW. No areas containing any potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits were
observed at any of the 12 assessed locations. Based on the negative results of the cultural
resources survey at these 12 locations, as well as the low potential for deeply buried, stratified
cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s professional opinion that the activities associated with the 12
CPBs have no potential to impact significant cultural resources and that no further investigations
are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the 12
CPB locations.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 12 Cathodic Protection Beds on the Longhorn Pipeline ROW

1.0 INTRODUCTION

During the months of May and July 2007, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of 12 Cathodic Protection Beds
(CPBs) along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn) pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in
Travis, Blanco, Gillespie, Mason, Crockett, Reagan, and Culberson counties, Texas. Horizon
conducted the cultural resources survey on behalf of Longhorn and Magellan Pipeline
Company, L.P. (Magellan), the contract operator for Longhorn. The investigations on privately
held lands were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, while the investigations on lands under the control of the
University of Texas (UT Lands) were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA as
well as the Antiquities Code of Texas. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were present and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or for formal designation as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The investigations on UT Lands were conducted under
Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit No. 4594.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of each of the 12 CPBs, and the production of a report suitable for review by
the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal Investigator for the
project. Ron Ralph (archeological subcontractor) assessed 8 of the CPBs on 9 May 2007, while
Michael Mudd (Horizon archeological technician) assessed the remaining 4 CPBs on 24 and 25
July 2007.
In all, the assessed locations total approximately 1.11 acres. The location, description,
and results of the investigations at each CPB are presented together in Section 4 of this report
following the presentation of the general cultural background of Texas in Section 2 and a
description of the general methods employed during the investigation presented in Section 3.
In summary, the intensive cultural resources survey of the 12 CPBs resulted in entirely
negative findings. No prehistoric or historic-age cultural materials were observed at any of the
12 locations. If any cultural materials had been present, they would have been confined to
surface contexts by the exposed limestone bedrock or shallow, gravelly clay deposits prevalent

along the ROW. No areas containing any potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits
were observed at any of the 12 assessed locations. Based on the negative results of the
cultural resources survey at these 12 locations, as well as the low potential for deeply buried,
stratified cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s professional opinion that the activities associated with
the 12 CPBs have no potential to impact significant cultural resources and that no further
investigations are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be
granted for the 12 CPB locations.

2.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
PaleoIndian, 9200 to 6000 BC; Archaic, 6000 BC to AD 800; Late Prehistoric, AD 800 to 1600;
and Historic, 1600 to 1870.

2.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9200 TO 6000 BC)

The PaleoIndian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in Texas. This
stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive lanceolate projectile points
and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These populations probably practiced a
foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1981), although
the best known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of large mammals, including
Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as the Kincaid Rockshelter,
Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that during the early part of the PaleoIndian, the Clovis
stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth, bison, and horse), as well as
smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A multitude of plants are
presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet. However, during the later
part of the PaleoIndian period, the Folsom stage, subsistence seems to have depended more
heavily on the specialized hunting of big game, particularly bison. This presumption is based on
the fact that only camps, stone-working, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, are
all that have been documented (Collins 1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to
the climate, which had become warmer and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

2.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6000 BC TO AD 800)

The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar transition found worldwide at approximately the same time; the most noted indicators being the extinction of
Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual decrease in
moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends first noted
during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic changes was a
greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the case in most
places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth ovens become
more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued. Although still
nomadic, Archaic people restricted their travel to smaller areas than did the PaleoIndian groups.

Chapter 2.0: Cultural Background

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is divided into 3
subperiods: Early (6000 to 3000 BC), Middle (3000 to 1200 BC), and Late (1200 BC to AD 800)
(Hester 1986). Each period is represented by specific point styles. The Early Archaic, the least
understood period, is distinguished by the switch from PaleoIndian lanceolate-shaped points to
notched and stemmed points. Overall, the Early Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar
throughout the state. Hester (1989) wrote that, prior to 3000 BC, the late Holocene hunters and
foragers were essentially indistinguishable in terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3,
which includes the Central Texas Plateau Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos
Canyon lands. After this date, regionally distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991)
also noted similarities when he wrote that the Early Archaic typological developments on the
Texas High Plains resembled developments in Central and Southwestern Texas, as well as in
other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid, climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open camp sites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and a cave, Hall’s Cave.
Lithic materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones,
projectile points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork
and Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late PaleoIndian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).
The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population distribution, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and
changes in settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and
McGraw 1985:38). Hester (1986) suggests that during this period, the inhabitants of the
Balcones Escarpment region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of
abundant regional resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
the upland areas, and special activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large, burned rock features (hearths as well as rock ovens) of the
early part of the Middle Archaic give way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens
(Collins 1995). These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different
subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represented intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. Middle Archaic projectile points include
the Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is considered by
Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment region.
4

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 12 Cathodic Protection Beds on the Longhorn Pipeline ROW

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of burned
rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter part of this
period (Collins 1995).
Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic and may reflect the
establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Story 1985:49; Black 1989:30; Black
and McGraw 1985). Hester (1986) suggests the development of wide-ranging trade contacts
may have also occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile points include triangular types
such as Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with the smaller, expanding stem points such as
Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.

2.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 800 TO 1600)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca AD 800 to 1300) and Toyah (ca AD 1300 to 1600). The Austin phase is characterized by
the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow points,
particularly the expanding, stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Prewitt 1974; Black 1989; Collins 1995).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contracting
stem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited agriculture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

2.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 1600 TO PRESENT)

The Historic period, which began with the arrival of Europeans into the region, can be
divided into 3 subperiods: early, middle, and late. Only a brief overview of the period is given
here. For a more detailed essay, see Newcomb 1993:1-63.
The first documented arrival of Europeans into Central Texas dates to the early 18th
century (Newcomb 1993). Their influence, however, preceded their arrival. In the late 17th
century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began migrating into Central Texas
to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines, missions, and on Spanish
ranches. At approximately the same time, horses stolen from the Spanish had become an
integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison hunters of the High

Chapter 2.0: Cultural Background

Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They terrorized native
groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to flee, some into
Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the region encountered native
groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the Apache, and the
diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. Their accounts, therefore, do
not provide direct analogs to prehistoric lifeway patterns, but rather represent a time of drastic
cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns may have prevailed through
time. Along with large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic
affiliations, small band-sized residential camps, both dating to this particular period, are found in
Central Texas (Collins 1995:386). These latter sites may represent indigenous groups.
The middle Historic subperiod began about 1730 and ended about 1800 as the mission
system was failing (Hester 1989; Collins 1995:386). Historic documents of this period make
reference to remnants of native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins
1995). Toward the end of this subperiod, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern
Texas from the high plains. Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be
highly biased since they are provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers
(Collins 1995).
The late Historic subperiod is composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung
nomadic native groups (primarily the Comanche),” and an archeological record of the European
presence (Collins 1995:387). The Comanche presence began fading in the mid- to late 19th
century. Their final demise heralded the end of the Native American presence in Texas.

3.0 GENERAL METHODOLOGY

Prior to the field effort, Horizon conducted archival research via the Internet at the THC’s
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas web site in order to determine if any previously recorded
archeological sites were documented within the vicinity of each of the CPBs, and if any previous
cultural resources assessments had been conducted near each location. The results of the
archival research are presented in the following section in association with each of the CPB
locations.
Following the archival review, Horizon archeological field technicians completed an
intensive pedestrian survey of the 12 CPB locations on 9 May 2007 and 24 and 25 July 2007.
In general, this included both intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing at each
CPB location. However, in areas where shallow clay soils or exposed bedrock were present,
shovel testing was not conducted. Three of the CPBs consisted of areas measuring 25 x 25
feet (ft) (0.01 acres) centered over the existing pipeline ROW. The remaining 9 CPBs consisted
of a 25 ft lateral over the ROW and then a 500-ft-long length of cable outside, but adjacent to
the existing ROW in order to facilitate a conventional ground bed. As each of the 500 ft lengths
of cable outside of the ROW necessitated only a minimal area for installation, a 10-ft-wide area
was assessed along the length of each 500 ft cable location. In all, the three 25 x 25 ft CPBs
totaled 0.03 acres, while the nine 25 x 500-ft CPBs totaled 1.08 acres (1.11 acres overall). The
Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 3
shovel tests per acre for projects less than 2 acres in size. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 23 shovel tests. As all shovel tests were negative, maps depicting their
locations have not been provided in this document.
During the field investigations, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils,
land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. If any new archeological sites
were encountered, standardized site forms were to be completed and submitted to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent housing. Similarly, “re-visit” forms
were to be completed for any previously recorded sites encountered during the investigations.
Standardized shovel tests forms were completed for each excavated shovel test, and digital
photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. The location of each CPB
location and shovel test was recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate
system and the NAD 27 map datum. The locations of the CPBs are presented in the following
section.

The 12 CPBs are located along the Longhorn ROW in Travis, Blanco, Gillespie, Mason,
Crockett, Reagan, and Culberson counties, Texas. The area environment, the results of the
archival reviews conducted for each location, and the results of the field investigations are
presented below in relation to each of the 12 project locations.

4.1

FAGERQUIST ROAD

The Fagerquist Road CPB is a 25 x 25-ft “deep bed” block over the existing pipeline and
entirely within the existing ROW in Travis County (Figure 1).
4.1.1

Area Environment

The area containing the Fagerquist Road CPB consists of a gently sloping and gravelly
ground surface within the existing pipeline corridor (Figure 2). Soils at this location are mapped
as Burleson gravelly clay, 3 to 5% slopes (BtC). The Burleson series consists of very shallow
gravelly clay soils overlying clay (NRCS 2007). The surface layer, about 6 inches thick, is
gravelly clay. Clay underlies this layer.
4.1.2

Archival Review

A review of the THC’s Atlas database indicated the presence of no previously recorded
sites within 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers [km]) of the Fagerquist Road CPB. According to the Atlas,
no formal cultural resources surveys have been conducted in the vicinity of this CPB location.
4.1.3

Assessment Conducted

During the field assessment of the Fagerquist Road CPB, the archeological field
technician conducted intensive surface inspection and 2 subsurface shovel tests. Shovel test
data are presented in Table 1.

Results

The surface inspection conducted at the Fagerquist Road CPB produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the heavily disturbed surface within
the confines of the existing ROW or within either of the 2 excavated shovel tests.
4.1.5

Recommendations

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources assessments at the Fagerquist
Road CPB, as well as the heavily disturbed nature of the location, it is Horizon’s professional
opinion that no significant cultural resources will be impacted by the activities at the Fagerquist
Road CPB and that no further cultural resources investigations are warranted. Horizon
recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for this location.

VAN HORN

The Van Horn CPB is a conventional ground bed consisting of a 500-ft lateral of cable
adjacent to the existing pipeline ROW in Culberson County (Figure 23). Approximately 300 ft of
the cable will be buried, while 200 ft of the cable will be inserted into 20-ft-deep holes bored
along the alignment shown in Figure 23.

5.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the 12 CPB locations resulted in entirely negative
findings. No prehistoric or historic-age cultural materials were observed at any of the 12 CPB
locations. If any cultural materials had been present, they would have been confined to surface
contexts by the exposed limestone bedrock or shallow, gravelly clay deposits prevalent along
the ROW. No areas containing any potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits were
observed at any of the 12 assessed locations.

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey at the 12 CPB locations,
as well as the low potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s
professional opinion that the activities at the 12 CPB locations will have no impact on significant
cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted. Horizon recommends that
cultural resources clearance be granted for all 12 CPB locations.
