Amarillo’s Historic Buildings

NOTES FROM THE EDITOR’S DESK
Our program this month will take us on a journey through time to the historic Herring Hotel. I thought it appropriate then to feature some pictures of a few of the other
older buildings in Amarillo.
Yes! I do know that the room keys on the cover are not from the Herring or any other
hotel in Amarillo. There is a picture online of an actual Herring room key, but I couldn’t manage to download it in a form I could use in the newsletter. So—we work with
what we have.

Here’s a note and a picture of an artifact from Dick Carter:

ARROW WRENCH
I found this artifact several years ago, in the fire pit (long unused) in the ruins of a small, circular house (?) located on the south side of the Canadian River, just east of the south end of the dam.
I thought it was a bison rib with a bullet hole in its broad end. Dr. Jack Hughes immediately identified it as an
arrow wrench, used to straighten curved branches for use as arrow shafts.
Go to Google for a full description, although the
Google story contains some questionable information, it has a good picture.

[ed. Note: the Google picture has a 6-inch ruler
for scale; their artifact may be about eight inches long.]

The Historic Herring Hotel:
The Rise and Fall of the Grand Dame of the Panhandle
Abstract
1926 brought a number of changes to the Amarillo skyline. The oil and gas industry was booming in the fields north of
Amarillo and the bank coffers were full. Due to the influx of people working the oil fields the small offices and hotels
were full as well. Competition with other cities for conventions was fierce as convention goers brought in money and left
bragging about the goodwill of the host city. The West Texas Chamber of Commerce Convention expected to bring
50,000 people to Amarillo and the Cattleman's Convention another 20,000 by the summer of 1926. The Amarillo Hotel
was owned by Ernest Thompson. The Palo Duro Hotel was owned by C. T. Herring. They were the largest hotels in the
city with about 400 rooms each. C.T. Herring, cattleman, businessman, banker and entrepreneur and Ernest Thompson, a
homegrown boy turned lawyer and hotel owner, saw the need for a convention hotel that would serve the needs of a small
town that was on the verge of becoming an important city. This presentation will discuss the rise of the historic Herring
Hotel, her history and her place in the future.
