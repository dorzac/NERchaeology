ABSTRACT
On March 20, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive
archeological survey of two areas that will be impacted by the Vance Jackson Road Low-Water
Crossings Improvement Project in northwest San Antonio, Texas. The survey was done under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8804. The areas surveyed, which total 1.8 acres, consist of two
upland drainages that will be modified. No prehistoric or historic archeological sites were
discovered in either area, both of which have been heavily disturbed by development on adjacent
lands and lack deposits and surfaces that could contain archeological sites. Because the proposed
project will not affect any archeological sites that are eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places or designation as State Antiquities Landmarks, it is recommended that no
additional archeological investigations are warranted prior to construction of the proposed
improvements.
Since this survey did not recover any artifacts, this project does not require artifact
curation. Project records and photographs currently housed at the offices of Prewitt and
Associates, Inc., will be transferred to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The
University of Texas at Austin.

INTRODUCTION
On March 20, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted
an intensive archeological survey of two areas that will be impacted by the Vance
Jackson Road Low-Water Crossings Improvement Project in northwest San Antonio,
Texas (Figure 1). The survey was done under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8804.
The project will consist of improvements at two locations centered on Vance Jackson
Road, one at the intersection with Orsinger Lane and the other about 2,500 ft to the
southeast at the intersections with Big Meadows Street, Tree Hill Drive, Monterrey
Oak, and Sugar Hill Drive (Figure 2). Improvements at the former will include
reconstruction of 561 ft of Vance Jackson Road within an 86-ft-wide right of way,
including replacement of the existing low-water crossing; reconstruction of 1,000 ft
of Orsinger Lane north of Vance Jackson Road within the existing 60-ft-wide right
of way; and modification of 925 ft of the unnamed creek channel that follows the
southeast side of Orsinger Lane. Improvements at the second location will include
reconstruction of 625 ft of Vance Jackson Road within an 86-ft-wide right of way,
including replacement of the existing low-water crossing; installation of three storm
drains beneath Vance Jackson Road; and modification of the unnamed creek channel
for 180 ft north of Vance Jackson Road between Big Meadows Street and Monterrey
Oak. The total horizontal Area of Potential Effects is 5.2 acres. The vertical Area
of Potential Effects will be no more than a few feet in many places, but will be as
deep as 5â10 ft where low-water crossings will be replaced, storm drains will be
constructed, and creek channels will be modified. All work will be done in existing
rights of way, except along sections of Vance Jackson Road where thin slivers of new
right of way will be required.
An archeological background review conducted in advance of fieldwork
indicated that, while the project area overall has a moderate to high potential for
Native American archeological sites, only two areas totaling 1.8 acres warranted
survey; these consist of the two drainage segments that will be modified,. Because
the other parts of the project area are within existing road rights of way where
any sites present have been badly disturbed or destroyed by road and utilities
construction, survey was considered unwarranted there. All work done during this
survey complied with the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas
Natural Resource Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191, VTCS 6145-9) and the City of
San Antonioâs Historic Preservation and Design Section of the Unified Development
Code (Article 6 35-360-634).
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is near the edge of the Balcones Escarpment along the
boundary between the Blackland Prairie to the southeast and the Edwards Plateau
to the northwest (Arbingast et al. 1973:6; Griffith et al. 2004; McMahan et al.
1984:Figure 1). This portion of the Blackland Prairie is characterized by rolling to
nearly level tall-grass plains underlain by soft interbedded marls, chalks, limestones,
and shales. The scarp along the edge of the Edwards Plateau is a rugged dissected
landscape of limestone hills and canyons created by extensive stream downcutting
and headward erosion. According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas, the project area

subsurface geology is the Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1983). The project area contains two natural surface water sources, both
of which are unnamed intermittent streams that drain 1.6â2.1 km north and
east to Olmos Creek. No Holocene alluvium is mapped along these tributaries or
anywhere close to the project. According to the U. S. Department of Agricultureâs
Web Soil Survey (USDA, NRCS 2019), soils are Eckrant cobbly clay and Eddy
gravelly clay loam. The former are rocky clay soils developed in residuum weathered
from limestone bedrock, and the latter are rocky clay soils developed in residuum
weathered from Austin Chalk bedrock.
RESULTS OF FILE SEARCH
Review of the Texas Historical Commissionâs Archeological Sites Atlas
revealed that there are three recorded archeological sites and two previous
archeological investigations within 1 km of the project area. Site 41BX773 is
0.6 km west of the intersection of Vance Jackson Road and Orsinger Lane. It was
recorded in 1987 by personnel with the Texas State Department of Highways and
Public Transportation in advance of widening of Huebner Road, and it was tested
that same year. Testing determined that it is a lithic procurement site with little
to no subsurface deposits and no temporally diagnostic artifacts; it was judged
ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and designation as
a State Antiquities Landmark. Site 41BX1151 is 0.8 km north of the intersection
of Vance Jackson Road and Orsinger Lane. It was recorded in 1995 as a thin lithic
scatter and possible burned rock midden. The cultural deposits appeared to be less
than 0.5 m thick. It was presumed to date to the Archaic period, but no temporally
diagnostic artifacts were found. Site 41BX1964, 0.6 km west of the intersection of
Vance Jackson Road and Orsinger Lane and immediately southwest of 41BX773,
was recorded in 2013 in connection with private development. It is a farm complex
dating to the midâlate twentieth century consisting of the remains of two houses,
a windmill base, a well or cistern, rock walls, and scattered artifacts. The Atlas
does not contain project information for the surveys in which the three sites listed
above were recorded, and it contains no information about the two other previous
investigations, other than that they were linear surveys performed in 1975 and 1977.
Historic aerial photographs indicate that the project area was entirely vacant
land at least as late as 1966. By 1973, residential development was starting to
encroach, with residential developments to the south. The area was fully developed
not long after that. Maps dating to the first half of the twentieth century or nearly
so (1953 USGS, 1922 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and 1959 county highway)
confirm the absence of development in the immediate area. Based on these sources,
the project area has a low potential for historic archeological sites.
METHODS OF FIELD INVESTIGATION
The archeological survey consisted of 100 percent pedestrian coverage by a
single archeologist of the two intermittent drainages that will be modified during
the project, totaling 1.8 acres. The archeologist walked two meandering transects
less than 30 m apart along the full length of each area, examining surface and

5

subsurface exposures for evidence of prehistoric and historic artifacts and features.
No shovel tests were dug because the entirety of each area consists of scoured upland
drainages with thin veneers of introduced fill and recently washed in sediment. In
this setting, there is no potential for in situ archeological remains, and thus shovel
testing is not warranted under the Texas Historical Commissionâs Archeological
Survey Standards for Texas. Records of the survey include photographs of both
areas showing survey conditions and a daily journal of observations.
SURVEY RESULTS
The northwestern survey area consists of a 925-ft-long intermittent drainage
that parallels the southeast side of Orsinger Lane (Figure 3). The southwest end is
at Vance Jackson Road, and the northeast end is at the entrance to an apartment
complex that borders the drainage on its southeast side. The corridor that will be
modified is 15â30 m wide. The area supports a variety of mature trees (oak, elm,
hackberry, cedar, and ligustrum) with an open grassy understory. The drainage
consists of two main channels. The western one is immediately adjacent to Orsinger
Lane and consists of a 0.5â1.0-m-deep channel containing introduced rubble and
poured-in-place concrete (Figure 4a). The eastern one, which is more meandering
and is fed by several side channels from the east, is typically 0.5 m deep (Figure
4b). It exposes jumbled concrete rubble and limestone rocks within a matrix of very
dark gray clayey sediment throughout the area. Concrete and limestone rubble are
exposed on the surface in many places, as is modern trash washed in by flooding.
Survey identified no archeological materials, and it is clear that the drainage has
been modified extensively in recent times, probably in association with construction
of Orsinger Lane to the west and the apartment complex to the east. Both intrude into
what originally was the bottom of this shallow upland drainage. If any archeological
sites were once present in this area, they were in the uplands to the west and east
and have been destroyed by development.
The southeastern survey area consists of a 180-ft-long segment of intermittent
drainage that runs north from Vance Jackson Road between apartment developments
to the west and east (Figure 5). At the north end, the drainage is gated where it
enters one of the developments, beyond which it is impounded to form a small lake
(Figure 6a). The corridor that will be modified is 12â20 m wide. The area is partly
overgrown with ligustrums and other shrubs and trees and partly open because of
flood scouring. The entire area consists of a single drainage channel, the bottom of
which is 1.5â2.0 m below adjacent lands to the west and east (Figure 6b). Because the
adjacent lands are so heavily modified by construction of the apartment complexes,
it is hard to know how much cutting and filling have occurred, but the presence of
abundant limestone in the bottom of the channel indicates it is cut into bedrock.
Modern trash washed in by flooding is common, and a single blue plastic water(?)
pipe indicates a partially buried utility line. Survey identified no archeological
materials, and it is clear that this drainage has been completely scoured by flooding
and modified during construction of the adjacent apartment complexes. If any
archeological sites were once present in this area, they were in the uplands to the
west and east and have been destroyed by development there.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No prehistoric or historic archeological sites were discovered in either
area during this survey. Both areas have been heavily disturbed by development
on adjacent lands and lack deposits and surfaces that could contain archeological
sites. Any archeological sites once present in the vicinity would have been in nearby
uplands outside areas that will be impacted by this project. Hence, the proposed
project will not affect any archeological sites that are eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places or designation as State Antiquities Landmarks,
and it is recommended that no additional archeological investigations are warranted
prior to construction of the proposed improvements.
