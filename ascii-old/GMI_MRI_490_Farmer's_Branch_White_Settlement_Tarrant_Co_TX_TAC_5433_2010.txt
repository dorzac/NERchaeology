MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, proposes to modify the banks and
channel bed of roughly 1.34 miles of Farmer’s Branch in White Settlement, Tarrant County,
Texas, to provide greater erosion control. Geo-Marine, Inc., was contracted by U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, Fort Worth District, to conduct cultural resources investigations within the current
project area, which consisted of a 100-foot-wide corridor on each side of Farmer’s Branch from
South Redford Lane to White Settlement Road, and a 50-foot-wide corridor on each side of the
Las Vegas Trail tributary of Farmer’s Branch from Farmer’s Branch to the George Street Bridge.
This work was performed between September 21 and September 28, 2009.
The objectives of the cultural resources study were to locate, identify, and describe all cultural
resources that can reasonably be detected from an inspection of the ground surface and creek
banks, as well as through shovel testing areas adjacent to Farmer’s Branch. A records search of
the National Register of Historic Places and the Texas Archeological and Historic Sites Atlases
was conducted prior to entering the field. No archeological sites, recorded historic sites, or
National Register-listed sites were located within 1 mile of the project area. The Atlas listed one
Historic Neighborhood survey, the William Terry Allen log cabin. One shovel test excavated in
the location where the cabin was likely originally located revealed no historic artifacts. One new
historic archeological site (41TR233), a historic spring belonging to early settler Jud Rowland,
was recorded, but all that remains of the site is the spring itself. In 1987, the city held a
dedication ceremony for the spring and established a local historic landmark plaque upslope from
the spring. In addition, five drainage structures (bridges and culverts) were identified during the
survey; only two were of historic-age.
Based on the streambank survey and shovel testing, the majority of the 1.34-mile project area was
considered to be of low probability to contain archeological historic properties or State
Archeological Landmarks, and no further investigations were recommended. However, though
site 41TR233 has lost integrity and is not recommended eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designated as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL), its
significance to local history of White Settlement advocates a recommendation of avoidance and it
be protected. Only one of the culverts, located at Redford Lane, maintains its integrity and is
recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. All materials collected or generated from this
project are permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report describes the results of a cultural resources intensive pedestrian survey of a portion of
Farmer’s Branch within the city of White Settlement in Tarrant County, Texas (Figure 1). The
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District, proposes to modify the existing
channels of Farmer’s Branch and the Las Vegas Trail tributary of Farmer’s Branch to provide
greater erosion control of the streams. In June 2008, Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), was contracted by
the USACE, Fort Worth District, under Contract # W9126G-05-D-0009, to conduct a cultural
resources survey of the proposed channel modification area (GMI Project #10509.00.39). The
project area consisted of a corridor measuring approximately 1.34 miles (mi; 2.2 kilometers [km])
along Farmer’s Branch and Las Vegas Trail tributary within the stated area of potential effects
(APE) (see Figure 1). Along Farmer’s Branch (approximately 1.04 mi [1.8 km], the APE
extended 100 feet (ft; 30 meters [m]) from each side of the channel, and along the approximately
0.3-mi (0.4-km]) Las Vegas Trail tributary, the APE extended 50 feet (15 m) from each side of
the channel.
The cultural resources investigations were undertaken in order to adhere to issues raised by
Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 [33 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) 403] and Section 404
of the Clean Waters Act [32 U.S.C. 1344] administered by the USACE, as well as the National
Environmental Policy Act [42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.]. All of these federal laws include cultural
resources concerns and invoke implementation of Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89-665; 80 Stat.
915], requiring cultural resources survey. In addition, since much of the project area crosses cityowned property, the project must comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter
191, the Natural Resources Code of Texas]. Accordingly, the present investigation was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Number #5433.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigations was to identify and inventory all cultural
resources—archeological deposits and architectural structures associated with Farmer’s Branch—
within the proposed project area and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
GMI archeologists conducted the intensive pedestrian survey between September 21 and
September 28, 2009. Arlo McKee of GMI served as Project Archeologist and meets the
Secretary of Interior’s Professional Qualification standards. Lindsey Skelton and Ben Fullerton
comprised the field crew, and Tanya McDougall served as Architectural Historian. Melissa M.
Green was the Principal Investigator for the project.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Farmer’s Branch and the city of White Settlement are within the upper Trinity River basin.
Environmentally, the upper Trinity River basin is located in the Southern Plains and includes
three physiographic zones. Moving from east to west, these zones are the Trinity River
Floodplain Forest, the Eastern Cross Timbers, and the Grand Prairie (see Yates and Ferring
1986:12–31 for a treatment of the environment of the upper Trinity basin). The project area is
located in the Grand Prairie, which is characterized by black, calcareous clay-rich soils and by a
dominance of grasses, with shrubs and trees present along stream bottoms and floodplains. The
Grand Prairie is supported by the limestone and clay formations of the Pawpaw Formation, Weno
Limestone, Denton Clay, Fort Worth Limestone, Duck Creek Formation, Goodland Limestone,
and Walnut Clay with sands introduced in alluvial settings from the Paluxy Formation farther to
the west.
The entire upper Trinity River basin, including the project area, falls within Blair’s (1950:100–
102) Texan biotic province. Yates and Ferring (1986:22) point out that the Texan province is not
so much a distinct geographic unit as it is a giant ecotone in which species from both the east and
the west overlap at the limits of their ranges. Species composition and forest density vary greatly
between the Eastern Cross Timers and the Grand Prairie. For prehistoric hunter/gatherers, the
potential for each zone to provide exploitable floral and faunal resources would have been
different from zone to zone.
FLORA AND FAUNA
The uplands of the Grand Prairie are host to small, widely scattered trees, but mature oak and
cottonwood trees dominate the floodplain environments. Although tall grasses and forbs are
historically the principal vegetation on the prairie, urbanization and growth on the Northcentral
Texas prairie have vastly altered the flora and fauna from that which would have been available
to prehistoric populations. Many of the species growing on the prairie could have provided
nutritious nuts and fruits for prehistoric human and deer populations, but the density of these
foods was too low to have been a significant resource for human subsistence. The Grand Prairie
would have supported occasional herds of large mammals opportunistically hunted for protein
and fat, and larger mammals such as pronghorn and, later, bison may have browsed the prairie,
3

but in low numbers and with intermittent frequency. Complete listings of the faunal resources of
the upper Trinity River basin can be found elsewhere (Yates and Ferring 1986:12–31), but the
region as a whole was characterized by a high species diversity with the majority of these
resources in the bottomlands (Lynott 1977; Yates and Ferring 1986:22). The undergrowth of
berries and grasses would have provided a variety of microhabitats of exploitable floral and
faunal resources for early hunter-gatherers. In addition to the large numbers of mammals and
birds attracted to it, the riverine floodplain area was also a source of fish, turtle, waterfowl, and
shellfish for prehistoric peoples. Despite the intermittent presence of large mammal prairie
species such as buffalo and pronghorn, faunal remains recovered from archaeological contexts
indicate that deer was the primary source of meat protein throughout the prehistoric period (Yates
and Ferring 1986:27).
GEOLOGY
The underlying geology of consists of Lower Cretaceous limestones, mudstones, and sandstones,
unconformably overlain by Quaternary-age fluvial, colluvial, and alluvial deposits. From south
to north, the area surrounding White Settlement is mapped as the Lower Cretaceous Kiamichi
Formation, Duck Creek Formation; and the Goodland Limestone (Bureau of Economic Geology
1972). Together, this series of fossiliferous, shallow-water marine limestones, claystones, shales,
and sandstones form a package no more than 120 m (394 ft) in thickness, with the bulk of the
sediment being limestone or limey shale. These units dip gently to the east into the East Texas
Embayment, so that regionally, the oldest units are exposed farther to the west and the youngest
to the east except where erosional downcutting has removed the younger units and so exposed the
older units (Barnes 1988).
Within the project area, Farmer’s Branch is a small third-order stream (following Strahler 1952),
and the channel has cut into the Goodland limestone. The banks of the channel are composed of
1–3 m (3.3–9.8 ft) of quaternary alluvial gravel bar formations that contain abundant angular to
subrounded limestone clasts from the underlying bedrock. Portions of the channel have cut
through thin beds of shale within the limestone and deposited dark, clay-rich materials
downstream. The stream is currently aggrading its floodplain through gravel deposits, and
consequently the city of White Settlement has been actively mitigating the effects of the
aggradation by periodically dredging active gravel bars and effectively lowering the channel
depth (Carol L. Davis, White Settlement Museum Manager, personal communication 2009).
SOILS
The soils surrounding Farmer’s Branch are classified as belonging to the Sanger-Purves-Slidell
Association (Ressell 1981). Soils belonging to this association are generally found on nearly
level and gently sloping uplands. These soils are generally clay-rich and can be both deep and
shallow. Though the project area is mapped as an uplands setting with residual soils, the majority
of the soils within the project area are alluvial, rather than residual, so the soil survey maps do not
accurately depict the area.
The vast majority of the project area (95 percent) has been assigned to the Sanger-Urban land
complex, 1 to 5 percent slopes. This map unit consists of a complex of soils that is intermixed to
the degree that it is not practical to map the units individually. The Sanger series typically
4

represents 45 to 70 percent of the map unit, and 15 to 30 percent is Urban land (Ressell 1981).
The Sanger series is classified as a Fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts (Soil Survey
Staff 2009). Soils of the Ponder, San Saba, and Slidell series can be included in the map unit by
as much as 25 percent. The soils making up the minor component are also typical of uplands
settings. Much of the distinction between the minor components comes from the variable depth
to bedrock, which can vary greatly across the small map unit.
The remaining 5 percent of the project area is mapped as the Aledo-Urban land complex, 1 to 8
percent slopes. This complex is composed of 50 to 65 percent of Aledo series soils and 15 to 40
percent Urban land (Ressell 1981). The Aledo series is classified as a Loamy-skeletal,
carbonatic, thermic Lithic Calciustolls (Soil Survey Staff 2009). Typically, less than 20 percent
of the map unit is composed of lesser soils belonging to the Bolar and Purves series. The
distinction between these minor soils with the Aledo series comes largely from variable depth to
bedrock as well as differences in surface textures. Aledo series soils have a Loamy-skeletal class,
and the Bolar and Purves soils contain greater amounts of clay.
CLIMATE
The climate of Tarrant County is classified as subtropical with humid, hot summers and mild
winters, except when periodic “blue northers” blow in. A wide range of annual temperature
extremes characterizes the region. Periods of cold temperature are short-lived; temperatures
falling to or below 20 degrees Fahrenheit (°F; -7° Celsius [°C]) average only six days per year.
For Tarrant County, the records for daily extremes are of a low of -8°F (-22°C) in February 1899
and a high of 113°F (45°C) in June 1980. Typically, temperatures average approximately 47°F
(8°C) in the winter season (December–February) and 83°F (28°C) in the summer season (June–
August) (Ressel 1981:128).
The region has an average annual precipitation of 81.5 centimeters (cm; 32.1 inches [in]); the
greatest amount occurs in April and May, when slightly more than a quarter of the annual
precipitation falls during the summer. Indeed, about 60 percent of the precipitation occurs during
the six-month interval of April through September. Rainfall usually occurs at night, with an
average about 44 rainfall events a year. The maximum historically recorded one-day rainfall
amount on record is 24.3 cm (9.57 in), which happened in 1932. Only 7.4 cm (2.9 in) of
precipitation fall on average as snow, and frozen precipitation occurs in three of four years.
Hailstorms typically occur on two or three days a year. The region has an average 249-day
freeze-free period.
The region receives sunshine about 76 percent of the time. The prevailing winds are usually from
the south, and the highest speeds reach 22.5 km (14 mi) per hour in March and April.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION
The following chapter is intended to provide a general background to the archeology of
Northcentral Texas, while supplying the interested reader with sufficient references for a more indepth coverage of the topic. This chapter is divided into three sections, the first of which gives a
brief summary of previous archeological research carried out in Northcentral Texas. The second
discusses the nature of the prehistoric and historic Native American archeological records in
broad terms, and the third considers the historic Euro-American and African-American settlement
in the area.
PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Four major reports concerning the archeology of the upper Trinity River basin (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987, 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986) aptly summarize the history of
archeological investigations within the upper Trinity River drainage and the cultural-historical
framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archeologists have resulted in recording numerous sites, it is apparent that much research remains
to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988:27–29), much of the excavation effort within the upper
Trinity River basin has focused on reservoir development, especially along the East Fork
(Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966) and the Elm
Fork (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner and Baird 1985). Field school excavations by
the University of Texas at Arlington at the Northlake site on Grapevine Creek were also reported
in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975). More recent investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney et al.
1988; Peter and McGregor 1988) and the test excavations of the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter
et al. 1987), have provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding of the
adaptations along the West Fork of the Trinity River.
Cultural resources investigations in Tarrant County in the last decade have been limited in scope
and results. The city of Arlington, Parks and Recreation Department, sponsored a series of
projects in southeastern Tarrant County (Hunt 1991; Hunt and Krapf 1996; Hunt and Peter 1993a,
1993b, 1995, 1996a, 1996b; Hunt et al. 1994; Peter and Gaither 1990). Three small projects also
7

were conducted for the Fort Worth Zoo (Edwards 1991; Edwards and Peter 1991; Peter et al.
1994). In 1996, a survey was undertaken at the Westside Recycling Facility in western Tarrant
County (Hunt et al. 1996) and at a housing complex in northern Tarrant County (Krapf and Hunt
1996). In 1994, a cultural resources survey was undertaken by Geo-Marine for the proposed
replacement of the East First Street Bridge over the West Fork of the Trinity River (Largent et al.
1994). That project included intensive pedestrian survey, backhoe investigations, and
architectural evaluations of standing structures. Site 41TR138, a prehistoric site with deposits to
a depth of 4 m (13 ft), was tested and recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. GeoMarine conducted additional surveys and excavations in 1996 for the proposed Randol Mill Road
extension in Fort Worth, where site 41TR138 was again encountered (Hunt 1997a, 1997b; Peter
et al. 1998). Geoarchaeological testing suggested that the site could date as early as 4,650 years
before present (yrs B.P.) and was of significance to understanding early human adaptation in the
area.
During a 1997 survey, AR Consultants identified 41TR160, a buried prehistoric site. That project
consisted of a pedestrian survey with limited shovel tests and backhoe trenching conducted in the
route of anticipated pipeline construction (Skinner et al. 1997). Thirteen trenches were excavated
at selected locations along the route to identify buried cultural and geological deposits.
Freshwater mussel shell was found eroding out of a sump and was also seen in the gully created
by an earlier pipeline excavation. Trenches were placed west of the earlier pipeline excavation to
locate the source of the mussel shells. Mussel shell, fire-cracked rock, and large mammal bones
were found below 1 m (3.3 ft) in the trenches. Skinner surmised that the site deposit could extend
to the west as far as 35 m (115 ft) to the sump edge, but no more than 4 m (13 ft) to the northeast
toward Trench 11 where no cultural materials were encountered. Bison and deer were
represented in the faunal collection. Two chert flakes, fire-cracked rock, animal bone, and mussel
shell were found at 1.22 m (4 ft) below surface. Fire-cracked limestone was found at 2.2 m (7.2
ft) below the surface (Skinner et al. 1997).
In 1995, AR Consultants conducted cultural resources investigations along the West Fork in
Grand Prairie, Dallas County. Survey and shovel tests revealed no cultural resources, though
archaeological monitoring of construction was recommended (Trask et al. 1995). Two
investigations in the city of Arlington in Tarrant County reported cultural resources deposits on
the Metrovest Development property, bounded on the west by FM 157 and on the east by the
Trinity River (Ferring and Byers 1996; Shaunessy et al. 1994). An additional investigation
reported cultural resources just west of FM 157 at the Trinity River Linear Park in Arlington
(Ferring 1994). Though both properties had been heavily mined for river gravels, the studies
investigated a total of 10 historic and prehistoric deposits on the north, central, and west sections
of the parcel.
At the Trinity River Linear Park, Ferring (1994) reported four prehistoric sites (41TR143–
41TR146) buried in the floodplain. The sites consisted primarily of charcoal, shell, and bone,
with some fire-cracked rock and a few stone flakes. Cultural resources deposits were observed at
depths ranging from 0.25 m (0.8 ft) to more than 5 m (16 ft) below surface. Ferring estimated the
age of the sites at between 750 and 3,000 yrs B.P. He concluded that despite low artifact density,
the sites were significant examples of occupation in aggrading fluvial environments.
Following the Linear Park project, two newly discovered sites, 41TR142 and 41TR141, on the
Metrovest property (now the Lakes of Arlington development area) were investigated and
recorded. Previously recorded site 41TR128—most likely destroyed by gravel quarrying over the
8

past years—consisted of the historic-era Bird’s Fort and prehistoric components ranging from the
Late Paleo-Indian to Late Prehistoric periods (Shaunessy et al. 1994:11). Shaunessy et al. (1994)
concluded that the land immediately west of the West Fork, in addition to several other small,
undisturbed portions, had a high potential for yielding buried cultural resources and
recommended backhoe testing. Ferring and Byers (1996) also felt that the floodplains on the east
edge of the Metrovest property exhibited a high potential for preserving cultural remains.
Investigations of site 41TR142 to the west revealed an occupation surface, including artifacts,
fauna, and a hearth, at roughly 1.4 m (4.6 ft) below surface. Evidence suggested primarily Late
Archaic occupation, with some Late Prehistoric artifacts. Ferring considered both site 41TR142
and the potential deposits in the narrow strip of undisturbed floodplain along the West Fork to be
significant in their preservation, complexity, and contributions to paleoenvironmental
reconstruction. He strongly encouraged the protection of these areas from subsurface
disturbance.
In 1998, Ellis (1998) surveyed a 3-mi-long (4.8-km) linear segment of the Metrovest property for
the development of a hike-and-bike trail that was developed with funds from the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT). He encountered a scatter of buried archaeological
deposits along the 3-mi length of the riverbank throughout the Metrovest property that he
inclusively designated as site 41TR167. The observed cultural deposits ranged from roughly 0.5–
3.5 m (1.6–11.5 ft) below surface and contained mainly burned earth and shell lenses, with very
sparse bone, lithic artifacts, or burned rock. Essentially, the length of the site encompassed the
entire proposed hike-and-bike project area, even though relatively discrete clusters of cultural
materials were recorded. Ellis’s designation of the entire left-bank-stretch of river as a single site
without specific loci made it difficult to manage or interpret prehistoric behaviors within the
expansive site area. A radiocarbon date from a deposit roughly 1 m (3.3 ft) below the terrace
tread surface at the western end of the site indicated that the upper portion of the terrace was
occupied 940–1,160 years ago (Ellis 1998). Nevertheless, the significance of this date is
overwhelmed by the expanse of the site and the number of discrete occupations in the deposits.
In 1999, Geo-Marine conducted a survey that included backhoe excavations of an alluvial terrace
setting along the proposed TRA 72-inch sewer pipeline (Burson et al. 2000). Burson’s survey
resulted in the identification of a large, diffuse site, 41TR174, during the trenching of floodplain
deposits on the left bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River. Backhoe trenching demonstrated
that cultural deposits extended from approximately 0.8–2 m (2.6–6.6 ft) below surface, located
entirely within the ubiquitous Pilot Point alloformation and its associated West Fork paleosol as
defined by Ferring (1990, 1994) and Ferring and Byers (1996). The site yielded quantities of
burned rock, burned clay, charcoal, shell, and mammal and fish bones. A radiocarbon assay of
charcoal collected during the survey from approximately 1.3 m (4.3 ft) in survey Backhoe Trench
2 at site 41TR174 indicated that the cultural deposits were 1,530–1,735 years old (Burson et al.
2000).
It was later discovered that site 41TR174 actually occurs within the northeastern part of Ellis’s 3mi-long (4.8-km) site 41TR167. Nevertheless, the portion of the site dated by Ellis for TxDOT is
located at the extreme opposite end of site 41TR167 and some 5 km (3.1 mi) southwest of site
41TR174. During 2003, Geo-Marine was contracted to conduct testing at 41TR174 prior to the
pipeline installation (Lintz et al. 2004). Testing included monitoring mechanical Gradall
excavations and opening manual excavation units around observed features or occupation zones.
The 2003 project resulted in the identification of three distinct buried cultural zones. Six hearth
and discard features were identified within one of these cultural zones designated as Analytical
9

Zone II. Despite the presence of these buried features, however, the absence of diagnostic
materials and the low quantities of archaeological materials were an indication that the
occupation being investigated was too sparse to be considered eligible for inclusion in the
National Register or for designation as a Texas SAL.
Geo-Marine conducted investigations in 2002 on the Riverside Oxbow Project through the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (Huhnke and Wurtz 2004). That project included
shovel testing, backhoe trenching, and pedestrian survey of a portion of the West Fork floodplain
in Fort Worth. Those investigations resulted in the identification of 41TR198, an 11-acre site
dating to the Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric periods. Buried components of this site yielded
four hearth-like features containing bone, mussel shell, and chipped stone between 0.5 and 2 m
(0.5 and 6.6 ft) below surface. This site exhibits a density of cultural materials that exceeds many
other previously identified sites in the region bearing similar assemblages and retains great
research potential. Geo-Marine began mitigation work at site 41TR198 in January 2009 and
analyses are currently ongoing.
In 2005, Geo-Marine conducted test excavations at site 41TR170 prior to the construction of a
portion of the proposed State Highway 121 over the Clear Fork of the Trinity River (Lintz et al.
2008). A three-stage tactic was taken in testing the site: archaeological monitoring of the
mechanical excavation of 28 backhoe trenches with geomorphological studies conducted; manual
excavation of 10 test units; and mechanical scraping to target occupation surfaces and the
excavation of three blocks. A series of low-density, highly stratified occupations dating to the
Transitional Archaic period was encountered, and though site context, integrity, and preservation
were good, the paucity of remains was generally insufficient to provide adequate data to address
significant regional research questions. The site was recommended ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no additional investigations recommended.
CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
Prehistoric Period
Prikryl (1987) established a generalized prehistoric chronological framework of six periods for
the upper Trinity River basin. Investigations at Lewisville Lake in Denton County (Lebo and
Brown 1990) and Joe Pool Lake in Dallas County (Peter and McGregor 1988) refined this
framework to a four-period model. The overall regional applicability of the phases recognized at
both lakes, however, remains to be demonstrated. The generalized chronology presented here
(Table 1) reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted from both sets of investigations
but is based primarily on the model provided by Peter and McGregor (1988). Brown and Lebo
(1991) and Lebo and Brown (1990) present a chronology keyed specifically for Lewisville Lake,
but it closely follows the chronology proposed for Joe Pool. The chronology proposed by
Skinner and Baird (1985) for Lake Ray Roberts and surrounding Northcentral Texas is very
similar, except that it replaces “Late Prehistoric” with “Neo-American” and lacks a Protohistoric
stage.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts. The
Field Ranch site (Jensen 1968) along the upper Elm Fork is a primary example of typical site
contexts. Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks
in the Cross Timbers, and Dalton, Midland, San Patrice, Golondrina, and Scottsbluff points have
been recovered as well (Lebo and Brown 1990:16). The Lewisville site (41DN72; Crook and
Harris 1957, 1958, 1961) and the Aubrey site at Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring 1989) are the bestknown Paleo-Indian sites within the region. The Lewisville site (41DN72) has been controversial
since its discovery because the initial radiocarbon samples collected there provided dates in the
37,000 B.P. range. Later work by Stanford (1982), however, resolved the controversy concerning
the date of the occupation. It appears that the presence of naturally occurring lignite, either as a
fuel in these hearths or as an inadvertent inclusion, accurately dates the coal several thousand
years earlier than the human occupation using the coal. Consequently, the usually accepted date
of 10,000–12,000 years ago for Clovis-period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for
the first human occupation of Northcentral Texas.
Although settlement-subsistence strategy data for early occupants remain limited, excavations at
the well-preserved Clovis-period Aubrey site (41DN479) at Lake Ray Roberts northwest of
Lewisville Lake indicate that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game animals alone; rather,
the entire range of prairie and forest species was used (Ferring 1989). Whether this pattern of a
more generalized foraging subsistence system characteristic of a Clovis adaptation in the Eastern
Woodlands contrasts with a subsistence focus on now-extinct, big-game species characteristic of
a Plains adaptation remains to be documented.
The subsequent Folsom complex is generally considered to be less dispersed than Clovis, and
Folsom sites are most common in the Western Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. Although a
Folsom presence in the Trinity River region is rare, several Folsom points have been found in
undated contexts in the Trinity River valley and vicinity. Likewise, Dalton projectile points have
been found on sites in the major stream valleys of Dallas and surrounding counties, although they
too are rare compared with many other later point types. The Dalton tradition occurred at the end
of the Paleo-Indian period and typically is found toward the east. The distinctive Dalton point
and sometimes chipped-stone woodworking tools (Dalton adzes) characterize these sites. All
other components of the Paleo-Indian toolkit are found in Dalton sites as well. By Dalton times,
the megafauna of the Pleistocene were extinct, and people used a hunting and wild-plant-food
11

collecting strategy that adapted to the emerging postglacial, early Holocene environment. Like
artifacts from the earlier Paleo-Indian occupations, Dalton points are often found on the surface
as isolated finds.
Other late Paleo-Indian projectile points such as the San Patrice and Scottsbluff types are also
found in the Dallas vicinity along the upper Trinity River. San Patrice points resemble Dalton
points, although they exhibit unique characteristics of being wider, with wide side notches and a
concave base, and appear to be coeval or slightly earlier. Both Dalton and San Patrice are likely
in situ developments from a Clovis fluted complex (Story 1990). They are also likely the product
of increased regional specialization during the turbulent beginnings of Holocene climatic
conditions. The core area for San Patrice points is eastern Texas and Louisiana (Story 1990).
Scottsbluff points, most commonly associated with the western plains Cody complex, are
sufficiently common in the area to generate hypotheses of plains population movements into the
Eastern Woodland fringes in response to climatic stress (Story 1990).
Archaic Period
An understanding of the Archaic period in the Northcentral Texas is limited by the lack of major
excavations on single-component sites. This is particularly true for sites of the Early and Middle
Archaic periods. Most evidence of an Archaic presence on the Upper Trinity comes from surface
finds of the Gary, Elam, Edgewood, Ellis, Godley, and Yarbrough diagnostic projectile point
styles. Skinner and Baird (1985) suggest that the general paucity of significant sites in the
vicinity of Lake Ray Roberts is due to the fact that the area was a marginal environment, a habitat
where food resources were scarce. In this model, populations (both Archaic and otherwise)
occupied the area only during specific seasons of the year, and then only long enough to collect
and process mast resources—specifically, acorns. Investigations along the West Fork by others
(Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986) indicate that primary contexts for Early and
Middle Archaic sites occur deeply buried within floodplain alluvium. Artifacts from these
periods are found on terrace surfaces and are frequently mixed with later materials. In fact, the
initial treatment of the Archaic period (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the
Carrollton and Elam foci, was based upon mixed materials from such terrace contexts.
Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer recognized as acceptable for
Northcentral Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at Lake Ray Roberts (Skinner
and Baird 1985) indicate that the Late Archaic period is characterized by assemblages left by
small bands of highly mobile, foraging hunters and gatherers, who only briefly used any
particular site. These sites were apparently reoccupied numerous times on a seasonal basis. Deer
and numerous small mammals were the primary food resources. The documentation of large pits
associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland/Chambers Creek drainage (Bruseth and
Martin 1987) suggests that important sociopolitical changes may have occurred during that time.
Unfortunately, the significance of these pits remains an enigma despite their excellent
documentation.

12

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin is marked by the
initial appearance of arrow points. The date of A.D. 700 for this period is based upon dated
contexts to the west in the Brazos River drainage. Lynott (1977) suggests that the Late
Prehistoric period may be divided into an early and a late phase, a division accepted by many
researchers (e.g., Lebo and Brown 1990; Skinner and Baird 1985). The early phase is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics, Scallorn and Alba arrow points, and a
continuation of the foraging subsistence system of the Late Archaic period. The late phase
reflects a Southern Plains influence with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the
Henrietta focus, various unstemmed and side-notched triangular points (e.g., Fresno, Harrell,
Washita), and the Perdiz point. Evidence of horticulture and the procurement of bison also
appear in sites of this later period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Prikryl’s
(1987) more recent assessment of the Late Prehistoric period largely follows that of Lynott
(1977).
Investigation of the Cobb-Pool site at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) has resulted in a
reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site yielded house structures,
roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates
from several features indicate that the site was occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth
century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddoan
occupation. Consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred during a
middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics were not introduced to
the region before this time.
Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive
change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented. However,
recent analysis of a Native American burial of a 50-year old woman, salvaged from site 41DL373
along Spring Creek in northeastern Dallas County, also suggests maize consumption (Peter and
Clow 2000). Radiocarbon dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155–1275,
and a carbon isotope ratio of -17.7 ‰ suggests that maize was consumed, but did not form a
major part of her diet (Peter and Clow 2000). These indications of maize consumption contrast
with a small grouping of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site
(41DL369; Cliff et al. 1996) in Dallas County. This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of
the East Fork of the Trinity River), yielded remains of at least four individuals, radiocarbon-dated
by bone collagen to Cal A.D. 1010–1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although
shell beads and a shell gorget were present. A carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 ‰ suggests that the
group’s diet was not high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Since the Harbor Pointe burials date
slightly earlier than the corn remains from Cobb-Pool and the burial from 41DL373, it is possible
that maize agriculture was introduced to the Dallas area ca. A.D. 1200. Conversely, this same
evidence may indicate that groups in the Dallas area practiced diverse subsistence patterns that
relied on corn to various extents.
Protohistoric Period
Historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for Protohistoric period
occupations in the upper Trinity River basin. Although several named Protohistoric archeological
complexes (Norteno, Garza, Tierra Blanca, Wheeler-Edwards) have been defined mostly for the
13

regions to the west of the Trinity River basin, no archeological sites affiliated with these
complexes are known to exist in the Dallas region. Historically, various bands of the Tonkawa,
Wichita, Caddo, Lipan Apache, Kiowa, and Comanche all are likely to have traversed the area.
Exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data, however, are almost nonexistent.
Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953) appear on a limited number of sites, no
Protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated, and characterizations of the Native American
adaptations during that period in Northcentral Texas are conjectural at best. A lack of
documentary evidence, together with a lack of interest among ethnologists and archeologists, has
contributed to this situation.
History and Development of Tarrant County and White Settlement
This section provides an overview of the history and development of Tarrant County and cultural
landscape development of White Settlement, Texas. Contextual information was obtained
through the review of historic maps, topographic maps, and aerial photographs; local historic
accounts obtained from the White Settlement museum; secondary literary sources; and on-line
resources.
History and Development of Tarrant County
The first European-American settlers in the region that is now Tarrant County in Northcentral
Texas were primarily from Arkansas Territory. The settlement of Bird’s Fort, established in 1840,
was the first permanent settlement in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and was established by Captain
Jonathan Bird. Located along the West Fork of the Trinity River in present-day Arlington, the
fort consisted of a blockhouse and several log buildings and served mostly as a trading station.
Additional families joined the initial occupants of the fort in the fall of 1841, but the fort was
abandoned by the spring of 1842. Bird’s Fort was not used again until the summer of 1843 when
Sam Houston, President of the Republic of Texas, attempted to meet with the Indian tribes and
establish a peace treaty. The treaty was signed on September 29, 1843, with representatives of
the Delaware, Chickasaw, Waco, Keechi, Caddo, Ionic, Biloxi, and Cherokee present (Garrett
1972; Sergeant 1953).
Meanwhile, in 1841, the Republic of Texas had granted a large portion of land to the Texas
Emigration and Land Company (TELC), which hoped to encourage settlement of Northcentral
Texas. The grants distributed to settlers by the TELC became known collectively as the Peters
Colony. The majority of the Peters Colony settlers held property north of Dallas, which they
retained in that name until 1852 when disputes between the TELC and the settlers caused some of
the settlers to band together to defend their title to the land they had settled. Twenty-six counties
were eventually carved out of the original Peters Colony, which included Tarrant County,
established in 1849 (Knight 1990:18).
On June 6, 1849, the United States Army established Camp Worth on the bluffs overlooking the
Trinity River, near where the Tarrant County Courthouse presently stands. Major Ripley Arnold
selected the site of the installation, which served as a post along the army’s frontier defense line.
The fort’s location atop a high bluff provided an unobstructed view of the surrounding area,
resulting an increased measure of security (Selcer 2004:4). Despite undergoing a change in name
from “Camp Worth” to “Fort Worth” in November 1849, the installation at Fort Worth was not a
14

walled or substantially fortified structure as the name may imply. Soldiers did construct
buildings within the installation, however. In 1853 when the army’s frontier defense line shifted
west, the army withdrew its troops from Fort Worth and turned the installation over to a
population of less than 100 civilian settlers who moved into the abandoned structures and adapted
them for their own use (Selcer 2004:7–9).
In spite of the fact that the military installation had been abandoned in 1853, the population of
Forth Worth and surrounding communities in Tarrant County rose dramatically during the latter
1850s. This was due largely to the prevalence of water and cheap fertile land. An important step
in connecting the town to a larger transportation network was the commencement of regular stage
service from Fort Belknap, northwest of Fort Worth near present-day Newcastle, to Dallas in
1857 (Selcer 2004:10–11). The first stage line to connect with Fort Worth was the United States
Mail Stage Line in 1856, and in 1858, Fort Worth became an overnight rest stop on the Fort
Worth–Jacksboro Stage Line, which connected to the Butterfield Overland Stage that linked St.
Louis to the West Coast (Sanders 1986:24; Schmelzer 1985). In 1860, settlement increased
further and spread from the town center (just west of the present-day location of the Tarrant
County Courthouse) to the south and northeast along the bluffs.
During the Civil War, the population in Tarrant County declined and development was stagnant.
Nonetheless, after the war, unlike many former Confederate strongholds, the county began to
reshape its economy and identity relatively quickly with the beginning of cattle drives and the
coming of the railroad (Roark 1991:5; Sanders 1986:29). Following the war’s end, a great
demand for Texas beef developed in northern states because the war had depleted the livestock
population in that region (Campbell 2003:297). In April 1866, the first contract cattle drive from
South Texas to Missouri passed through Fort Worth. The town served as a final stopover for the
cattle drives heading from South Texas to shipping depots in Oklahoma and Kansas along the
Eastern Trail. Fort Worth was transformed into a bustling frontier town. The city and county
population was quickly growing and even greater growth was on the horizon with the arrival of
the Texas & Pacific Railroad in 1876 (Sanders 1986:29).
Throughout Texas, the railroads catalyzed the statewide population growth and economic boom
after the Civil War and continuing through the early twentieth century, when the railroads were
integral to the distribution of local products (Campbell 2003:309). Railroads proved essential to
the expansion of the county’s industrial growth, therefore essential to its long-term financial
stability. The Texas & Pacific Railroad (T&P) reached Fort Worth on July 19, 1876, five years
after Congress granted it a charter to construct its transcontinental line (Selcer 2004:20). The
T&P was the only railroad in the state of Texas to operate under a charter granted by the federal
government (Campbell 2003:306). Each of the industries that developed in Fort Worth and the
surrounding areas in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—namely, the meatpacking
industry, lumber yards, and oil manufacturing companies— relied on the railroad system in order
to thrive.
Although the coming of the railroad meant growth and development for many towns in Tarrant
County, other areas developed without the railroad, establishing agriculturally based
communities. Between 1890 and 1900, nearly 1,000 new farms were established in the county,
with the principal crops being cotton, corn, and wheat. Farms varied in size from 40 to 640 acres
or more, with the majority of larger tracts located on the west side of the county and largely used
for grazing (Hawker et al. 1924:868–869).

15

With the varied successful industries in the county, the early 1900s proved to be a period of
steady growth. By 1911, Fort Worth had outgrown its system of artesian wells, prompting city
officials to impound Lake Worth in northwest Tarrant County. The reservoir provided the
growing area with an added water supply and better fire protection. In 1917, the U.S. entered
World War I, and the army established Camp Bowie in Arlington Heights, which was responsible
for training 100,000 men. Also located in the county were three Army Air Corps airfields:
Hicks, 9 miles north of Fort Worth; Benbrook, 9 miles west of Fort Worth; and Barron, near
Everman (Handbook of Texas Online 2009a).
After the war, Tarrant County continued to thrive. More than 250 commercial establishments
existed throughout the area, and agriculture remained prosperous. However, in 1929, the stock
market crashed and the onset of the Great Depression affected Tarrant County, as it did the entire
nation. The true effects of the economic collapse did not affect the county until 1932 because of
the amount of construction underway. After 1932, however, construction projects slowed and
road funds were exhausted. By 1940, 16 percent of the population in the county either was out of
work or was participating in public emergency work (Handbook of Texas Online 2009a).
It was only after the U.S. entered World War II that the effects of the depression eased. Many
people joined the armed forces or worked in factories that supported the war effort. In 1941, the
army acquired 500 acres in Tarrant County, on the west side of Fort Worth near White
Settlement, for the construction of a bomber factory operated by Consolidated Vultee Aircraft
Corporation (McGown 2003:99). The plant was built identical to those in Oklahoma and
Georgia; however, an extra 29 feet were added to the building, making it the longest aircraft plant
in the country. Adjacent to the plant, the army built Tarrant Field, renamed Carswell Air Force
Base in 1942, to train B-24 pilots. The Strategic Air Command operated out of Carswell Air
Force Base from the 1940s to the 1990s. Today, the base in known as the Naval Air Station Joint
Reserve Base Fort Worth (NAS JRB Fort Worth) and is operated by the U.S. Navy (Handbook of
Texas Online 2009b).
Following World War II, the transportation network in Tarrant County was greatly improved.
Built during the apex of 1950s federally funded highway projects, the Dallas-Fort Worth
Turnpike (now part of Interstate Highway [IH] 30) opened in 1957, running approximately
parallel and just south of the original T&P line (now Union Pacific). The turnpike intersected
IH 35W; the network of feeder roads and on-ramps at the interchange was popularly known as the
“mixmaster.” In 1970, Fort Worth and Dallas were combined into one standard metropolitan
statistical area (SMSA), and in 1972, the term “metroplex” was copyrighted as the region’s name
(Cashion 2006:130). A network of interstates and tollways now connects the two cities and
provides access to the many smaller cities that make up the metroplex. The major advances in
transportation have affected the entire area, providing an influx of people, goods, and materials.
Cultural Landscape Development of White Settlement, Texas
White Settlement, Texas, located in westcentral Tarrant County on the western edge of Fort
Worth, received its name early on when European-American settlers began moving to the area
that was still heavily populated by Native Americans (White Settlement Museum n.d.). The first
settler to lay claim to the area west of the Trinity River was Logan Vandiver. A “headright
certificate” dated February 16, 1838, granted Vandiver 1,476 acres in the area where White
Settlement is now located (White Settlement Museum n.d.). Because of limited protection from
16

Birds Fort, located on the West Fork of the Trinity River, settlement in the area was slow and
difficult. After the establishment of Fort Worth in 1849, settlement west of the Trinity River
increased, beginning with a few trading posts and later developing into organized communities.
The community of White Settlement gradually developed around the homesteads of the three
Farmer brothers from Tennessee—Elijah, David, and Joseph Farmer (Handbook of Texas Online
2009c). In 1854, a group of wagons with 10 families from Kentucky arrived in the White
Settlement area hoping for a fresh start (White Settlement Museum n.d.). Among them were J. K.
Allen, Sr., and his family. J. K. Allen, Sr., later became a county commissioner and a state
representative (Chambers n.d.).
With a diminished threat of attacks from Native Americans, the community of White Settlement
slowly grew, and by the 1860s, the community was in need of a school. The subsequent oneroom log cabin was known as Grant’s School and was located in an area known as Pecan Grove,
where the NAS JRB Fort Worth runway is now situated (Dickey 1990:21). The log cabin school
was the focal point for community gatherings and events.
After suffering the effects of the Civil War, White Settlement remained a frontier outpost and
eventually developed into a farming community. Unlike Fort Worth, the railroad had completely
bypassed White Settlement and had little effect on its growth and economic development.
However, by 1911, the exuberant growth of Fort Worth could be felt throughout the county, and
was never more apparent than with the construction of Lake Worth, located north of White
Settlement. The lake drastically changed the natural landscape of the area; however, it had little
effect on the cultural landscape of White Settlement. It did, however, provide the area with a new
source of recreation (McGown 2003:54).
Over the following decades, growth in White Settlement was slow. Nevertheless, the anticipation
and onset of World War II drastically transformed the quite little community into a growing city.
In 1941, the U.S. Army purchased over 500 acres on the west side of Fort Worth for the
construction of the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation bomber factory and Tarrant Field
(McGown 2003:99). The quaint community of White Settlement, whose population was 500
prior to the construction of the plant and air field, exploded to 10,000 in a matter of months. The
new residences were bomber plant employees, civilian employees of the Army Air Field, and
families of servicemen stationed at the air base (Cashion 2006:85). In a response to the rapidly
increasing population, the community voted to incorporate the city in 1941 (White Settlement
Museum n.d.).
The rapid influx of new residents prompted a building boom. Most of the new houses were the
government-built, defense-worker housing types. The government housing was primarily located
on the west side of Cherry Lane. The cluster of homes was known as Liberator Village, in
reference to the B-24 “Liberator” bombers being built at the plant (Figure 2). Two-story
apartments, located east of Cherry Lane, were also constructed and known as “Victory
Apartments.” After the war, the aircraft plant continued to operate and the building boom
maintained its momentum. With the absence of building codes, residents built their homes as
funding allowed. One common practice was for a developer to build the shell of the house and
sell it at a low price. This allowed the owner to install wiring and plumbing as they saw fit,
considering the city did not offer sewer, gas, or phone services at that time (White Settlement
Museum n.d.).

As the population continued to increase and the building boom in full swing, the city found it
necessary to begin improving on services. By the 1950s gas, telephone, and garbage services
were provided to all homes in the city, and a private water company was purchased. With
improved services came taxes. Not all of the citizens were receptive to the new taxes and several
protest meetings were held. However, the tax bill was accepted and eventually city services were
upgraded to those comparable or better than any surrounding community (White Settlement
Museum n.d.).
In the 1970s and 1980s, a commercial building boom came to White Settlement, providing the
area with large retail outlets and the city with a new source of revenue (White Settlement
Museum n.d.). It was also at this time that the connecting transportation network around the city
was improved. In 1970, Loop 820 was completed along the city’s west and south border, opening
the city to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex (Handbook of Texas Online 2009c). Although the
city limits of Fort Worth are imposing upon the east side of White Settlement, the NAS JRB Fort
Worth base currently creates a barrier, allowing the city to maintain its quaint community
lifestyle.

CHAPTER 4
METHODS

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, a search of available archival data was undertaken. The purpose of this
background research was to identify all known archeological investigations, archeological sites,
and historic properties (i.e., cultural resources eligible for or listed on the National Register of
Historic Places) that might be situated within or near the project area. The results of the research
were used to guide the field methods, to determine the areas in which previously recorded sites
would be encountered, and to locate landforms with the highest probability to retain archeological
deposits. The data also served as a contextual framework so that any newly recorded sites could
be evaluated for significance.
Site records obtained from the Texas Archeological and Historical Sites Atlas maintained by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) were consulted to obtain information on previous
investigations and known sites within a 1-mi (1.6-km) radius of the project area. Unfortunately,
the information listed on the Atlas is often quite limited. The search yielded no archeological
sites or NRHP historic properties. One linear archeological project, conducted in 1991, was listed
on the Atlas. The project occurred along Clifford Street from West Loop 820 to South Grants
Lane, but unfortunately, no additional information was provided.
Five neighborhood survey properties were listed near the project area (Table 2). Of these, only
one, the William Terry Allen Log Cabin, was originally located within the current APE. The log
cabin originally was built within the project area on what is currently the southwest corner of
South Las Vegas Trail and Rowland Drive (THC Atlas Data Form). Originally built in 1864 by
W. T. Allen, one of the original settlers of the community of White Settlement, the small cabin
served as the family home until 1908. In 1933, one of Allen’s descendents sold a portion of the
family property, and the cabin was moved north of its original location and was expanded. Two
decades later, the property was sold to the U.S. government, and the cabin was moved again to
Fort Worth. In 1976, the White Settlement Historical Society raised funds to return the cabin to
White Settlement, and it presently sits on the property of the White Settlement Historical
Museum, roughly two blocks east of its original location. The museum has numerous historical
displays on the outside lawn of the property, many of which will be affected by the present
project; however, the W. T. Allen Log Cabin comfortably rests outside the current APE.

ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODS
Fieldwork consisted of a streambank pedestrian survey and intensive shovel testing of the
streambanks within the APE. The survey area contained lands owned by the city as well as
private property. Shovel testing was limited to the properties in which landowners had given
GMI appropriate rights-of-entry permission. The pedestrian survey was conducted to identify
disturbances within the project area and to identify all potential prehistoric and historic resources
within the project area and to identify landforms with potential for intact cultural deposits. Areas
for shovel test units were selected during the pedestrian survey and marked with pin flags for later
excavation. Shovel tests were placed on a judgmental basis to confirm the presence/absence of
intact soil profiles and to search for cultural materials that may not have been obvious in cutbank
exposures. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm (12 in) in diameter and were excavated to 80
cm (32 in) below ground surface (bs) or to subsoil, if it was encountered first. All shovel test fill
was sifted through 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware cloth to identify any subsurface cultural materials
that might be present. Data regarding soil color, texture, and content for each shovel test were
recorded on a standardized form.
A site is defined on the basis of content and extent. When a shovel test yields cultural material,
additional shovel tests are excavated in the cardinal directions in a cruciform pattern at 5-m (16.5ft) intervals around the initial test until two sterile shovel tests are encountered. A site is then
defined within the extent of positive shovel tests. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five
or more cultural items of at least two different artifact materials or classes (e.g., prehistoric stone
tool manufacturing debris exhibiting different raw materials, or manufacturing debris in
combination with stone tools; or historic-era ceramics [or glass] of several different types, or
ceramics in addition to glass) within a 20-m (65.6-ft) square. Cultural remains meeting these
criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted
to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin. Conversely, the discovery of
one or two cultural items (either surface or subsurface) not meeting these criteria is considered an
isolated occurrence of human activity and is simply documented by location and content;
likewise, historic-era material representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not considered
a site, with only location and content documented.
20

Although no artifacts were collected and thus none require curation, all notes, forms, and
photographs obtained during this project will be curated at TARL.

RESULTS OF SURVEY

The archeological and historic structures survey was conducted along a corridor measuring
approximately 1.34 mi (2.2 km) along Farmer’s Branch and Las Vegas Trail tributary. The APE
extended 100 feet (ft; 30 m) from each side of the channel along Farmer’s Branch (approximately
1.04 mi [1.8 km], and 50 feet (15 m) from each side of the channel along approximately 0.3-mi
(0.4-km) of Las Vegas Trail tributary. The Farmer’s Branch portion extended from the Redford
Lane bridge eastward to White Settlement Road, and the Las Vegas Trail tributary portion
trended southward from Farmer’s Branch along the west side of Las Vegas Trail to just north of
George Street. Twenty shovel tests were excavated within the APE (Figure 3). Seven drainage
structures were identified (from west to east) with Farmer’s Branch: two culverts located on
Redford Lane and Judd Street; four bridge class culverts located on Las Vegas Trail, Pemberton
Drive, Mirike Drive, and Meadow Park Drive; and one bridge located on White Settlement Road
(Figure 4).
REDFORD LANE BRIDGE TO LAS VEGAS TRAIL TRIBUTARY
The pedestrian survey began at the Redford Lane bridge and continued eastward to the Las Vegas
Trail tributary (Figure 5). The channel banks between Redford Lane and Judd Street were gently
sloping, and at the time of survey, the entire area was extremely saturated. Only a very small
cutbank was near Redford Lane and exposed roughly 1 m (3.3 ft) of extremely gravelly dark
brown clay (Figure 6). No cultural materials were observed in this area during the pedestrian
survey. One shovel test (Shovel Test 5; Table 3) was excavated on a 5-degree slope north of the
channel in this area (see Figure 2). The shovel test contained a gravelly clay fill with modern
trash in the upper portion of the unit. Excavation ceased at 65 cmbs (26 inches below surface
[inbs]) when a deposit of large gravels was encountered.
Beginning in the section between Judd Street and Las Vegas Trail, the cutbank became more
pronounced and exposed a deeper profile of sediment. Good exposures were largely present
along all sections of the creek east of Judd Street. At the confluence of the Las Vegas Trail
tributary and Farmer’s Branch, more than 1 m (3.3 ft) of gravelly sediment was exposed on the
south side of the creek (Figure 7). In this area, the channel clearly flows on bedrock for the
remainder of the project area. One shovel test (Shovel Test 4; Table 3) was excavated north of

was located on the relatively flat bench on the left side of the photograph.

The pedestrian survey then continued south along the Las Vegas Trail tributary and three shovel
tests were excavated along the streambanks as the surveyors progressed back north toward
Farmer’s Branch. In the section north of Moran Street were exposed cutbanks on both sides of
the stream. On the west side of the stream, the cutbank exposed over 1 m (3.3 ft) of brown
(10YR 4/3) gravelly clay fill with concrete fragments. Underlying the fill was a dark buried soil
(Figure 9). The buried soil in this section was interpreted as the natural ground surface that has
been buried by construction fill. On the east side of the creek, the ground surface was nearly 1 m
higher in elevation than the west side. A cutbank on the east side showed nearly 1 m of dark clay
soil overlying a series of light brown gravel bar deposits (Figure 10). This similar arrangement of
dark-colored gravelly clay sediments overlying light-colored gravel bar deposits continued on the
east side of the creek to the southern end of the tributary project area. However, south of Moran
Street, the light-colored sediment was not as thick and gravel bar deposits could be seen within
the overlying dark-colored sediment. Three shovel tests were excavated above the banks of the
Las Vegas Trial tributary, and no significant cultural materials were encountered. In Shovel Test
1, one wire nail was found between 60 and 70 cmbs, suggesting that the sediments within the
shovel test were composed of recent fill.
Within this section, culverts over Farmer’s Branch at Redford Lane and Judd Street were
identified. They are discussed in Chapter 6.

LAS VEGAS TRAIL/ROWLAND DRIVE INTERSECTION TO PEMBERTON STREET
Farmer’s Branch crosses South Las Vegas Trail at the Las Vegas Trail/Rowland Drive
intersection. The southwest corner of this intersection is currently used as park land, and the
remaining corners are residential. According to the THC Atlas records, the southwest corner of
this intersection is the original location of the W. T. Allen Log Cabin, which is currently located
on the White Settlement Museum grounds, about a block to the east. Three shovel tests (Shovel
Tests 6–8) were excavated near this intersection on relatively flat ground. Shovel Test 6 was
located on the southwest corner of the intersection, south of Farmer’s Branch. This area has been
affected by residential construction (Figure 11) and a concrete pad is currently in the center of the
property. The shovel test yielded a small concrete fragment and corrugated metal between 20 and
40 cmbs (8 and 16 inbs). At 60 cmbs (24 inbs), dense large gravels were encountered and
excavation ceased. Shovel Tests 7 and 8 were located east of South Las Vegas Trail on the
residential properties north and south of the creek, respectively. Within Shovel Test 7, numerous
bottle glass fragments were identified throughout the upper 60 cm (24 in). A small brick
fragment was recovered in the upper 20 cm (8 in) of Shovel Test 8 before excavation was
terminated because of a large gravel deposit. Within the southern cutbank near Shovel Test 8, a
large piece of concrete was seen 1 m (3.3 ft) below the surface (Figure 12). This suggests that
gravelly fill composing the properties near South Las Vegas Trail has been brought in relatively
recently. An examination of aerial photographs further shows that this entire area was disturbed
in association with the construction of the Las Vegas Trail culvert (Historic Aerials 1970).

Moving eastward from South Las Vegas Trail, Farmer’s Branch continues to flow on top of
exposed bedrock, and the creek banks continuously expose gravel deposits, often with modern
metal and concrete at depth. North of Adell Street is open park land that contains a lateral
sequence of gravel bar deposits (Figure 13). A concrete-and-stone, low-water crossing has been
constructed across the channel, providing access to the park. Shovel Tests 9 and 10 were
excavated in two of the gravel bars in the park. Both shovel tests contained abundant asphalt
fragments to a depth of at least 80 cmbs (32 inbs). In Shovel Test 9, one brick fragment stamped
with the letters “ACM / BRI” was recovered in the upper 20 cm (8 in) (Figure 14). The brick was
likely manufactured by the ACME Brick Company; however, the character spacing does not
remotely resemble any dateable brick types (Steinbomer 1982). The presence of asphalt
throughout these two shovel tests indicates that the sediments in the park north of Adell Street
have been only recently deposited. An examination of a succession of aerial photographs of this
area revealed that several buildings once stood on this property between 1963 and 2004 (Historic
Aerials 1963 and 2004). The shape and location of the channel also vary considerably between
the 1956 and 1964 aerial images, suggesting that much of the park area was landscaped as part of
building construction (Historic Aerials 1956).
Immediately west of Pemberton Street is a large open field on the north side of Farmer’s Branch.
This property is relatively flat, but contains several low-lying knolls above the surrounding
ground surface. Shovel Test 11 was excavated on one of these low knolls, and it was found to be
composed almost entirely of large gravels. No cultural materials were identified.
Within this section, culverts over Farmer’s Branch at Las Vegas Trail and Pemberton Drive were
identified. They are discussed in Chapter 6.

PEMBERTON STREET TO MEADOW PARK DRIVE AND SITE 41TR233
The section east of Pemberton Street revealed only a very thin package of soft sediment above
bedrock on the north side of Farmer’s Branch (Figure 15). In many places, modern debris was
seen in the cutbanks near the top of the exposed bedrock (Figure 16). For this reason, no shovel
tests were excavated within the section between Pemberton Street and Mirike Drive. Farmer’s
Branch appears to begin actively eroding the properties from this point downstream. Numerous
properties are being significantly affected by the erosion, and several property owners have
initiated their own flood-control methods. On the south bank of the creek, one property owner
has built and maintained a substantial brick-and-concrete retaining wall for erosion control
(Figure 17). Unfortunately, access was not permitted to many of the properties along this section
of creek, so no shovel testing was performed in the area. The creek banks were inspected, and no
cultural materials were identified. Similar to other sections of the creek, the most substantial
cutbank in the area contained 1.5 m (5 ft) of dark brown gravelly clay fill with numerous gravel
beds typical of high energy flood events.

The section between Mirike Drive and Meadow Park Drive is one of the more interesting sections
Farmer’s Branch. Located at 8320 Hanon Drive on the western end of this section is the White
Settlement Historical Museum. On the museum grounds among numerous displays and buildings
significant to the history of the community is the William Terry Allen Log Cabin (Figure 18). All
of the buildings on the museum lands have been donated and relocated to the property from their
original locations. Because the proposed bank modification project will affect the museum

property, the White Settlement Historical Society is currently discussing plans to relocate the
museum collections (Carol L. Davis, White Settlement Museum Manager, personal
communication 2009). One shovel test (Shovel Test 12) was excavated behind the museum but
no cultural materials were identified.

From the museum grounds, Farmer’s Branch flows northeastward before making a sharp bend
southward at the property of the White Settlement Administration Building. This area is
designated as the John M. Waggoman City Park, and the community periodically holds
dedications and other social functions on the property. The fire department building is also
located within the proposed project area on the south side of the creek.
Site 41TR233: On the southern edge of the Farmer’s Branch channel is a historic spring with a
stone-and-mortar well collar that once belonged to Jud Rowland, an original homesteader of the
White Settlement area (Figure 19). Because of its significance to local history, the spring was
recorded during this survey as archeological site 41TR233. In 1987, the town held a dedication
ceremony and established a local landmark and path walkway to the site on the bank above the
well (Figure 20). Although the city values the well as a symbol of the community’s history, the
stone walkway has been damaged and numerous stone steps have gone missing since it was
established. The creek bank in this area has also been extensively modified to allow for civic
functions on the park lawn. These modifications have had a negative effect on the depositional
and scenic integrity of the site. Because the area surrounding the site was either high slope or
under a concrete path, no shovel tests were excavated in the area immediately surrounding the
well. Two shovel tests were excavated north of the site, one on each side of the creek in areas
that appeared to contain natural and unaltered sediments in an attempt to locate historic artifacts
related to 41TR233. Shovel Test 13 was located across the creek to the north on a high bank near
the administration building, and Shovel Test 14 was on a low floodplain on the same side of the
creek as the site. The low floodplain around Shovel Test 14 was composed almost entirely of a

dense deposit of gravels, and the shovel test was not able to penetrate below 30 cm (12 in). No
cultural materials were identified in either shovel test, and it was concluded that all that remains
of the historic spring is the spring itself.
Within this section, culverts over Farmer’s Branch at Mirike Drive and Meadow Park Drive were
identified. They are discussed in Chapter 6.
MEADOW PARK DRIVE TO WHITE SETTLEMENT ROAD
The section east of Meadow Park Drive shows some of the most damaging effects of erosion
within the project area (Figure 21). Farmer’s Branch flows eastward from Meadow Park Drive
before turning sharply to the south prior to reaching Melrose Court. Immediately west of this
bend is an area where high-water events have begun to carve a new channel south of the current
channel. This high-water erosion has removed several meters of bank recently, causing damage
to existing power lines (Figure 22). Several shovel tests were excavated along this actively
eroding section of the creek (Shovel Tests 16–18). No cultural materials were identified, and the
sediments identified in the shovel tests, and along exposed cutbanks, suggested a high-energy
depositional environment for an extended period of time.

The final two shovel tests were excavated on a narrow floodplain south of Farmer’s Branch near
South Rose Street. The cutbank in this area contained a thin lens of charcoal at 40 cmbs (16 inbs)
(Figure 23). The charcoal lens appeared to be resting on top of coarsely stratified gravelly clay.
No cultural materials were observed in the cutbank near the feature. Shovel Test 19 was
excavated approximately 3 m (9.8 ft) south of the cutbank in order to investigate whether or not
the feature was cultural. No artifacts were identified in Shovel Test 19, but numerous large
pieces of charcoal were observed in the shovel test at 40 cmbs (16 inbs). Shovel Test 20 was
placed 5 m (16.4 ft) west of Shovel Test 19 to further investigate the area surrounding the
charcoal lens. In this shovel test, a small piece of rubber and one white plastic wrapper was
identified in the 40–60-cm (16–24-in) level. Since modern cultural materials were found in the
same stratigraphic position as the charcoal lens, it was thus determined that the feature was the
result of recent activity.

East of South Rose Street Farmer’s Branch turns northward toward White Settlement Road. Land
access was not granted for the majority of this property. The creek banks were visually inspected
and no cultural materials were identified. As the creek begins to bend northward, it has exposed a
15-m-high (49-ft) section of the Duck Creek Formation in this area. The property on top of this
landform was also inspected and no cultural materials were identified.
Within this section, the bridge over Farmer’s Branch White Settlement Road was identified. The
bridge is discussed in Chapter 6.

CHAPTER 6
NATIONAL REGISTER CRITERIA AND EVALUATIONS

The cultural resources investigation documented in this report was undertaken with three primary
management goals in mind:
1. to locate all historic and prehistoric cultural resources occurring within the designated
project area;
2. to evaluate the significance of these resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP or for designation as an SAL; and
3. to make recommendations for the treatment of these resources in relation to the proposed
undertaking, based on their NRHP and SAL evaluations.
NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of cultural resources properties is based on federal guidelines.
The criteria to evaluate properties for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Based on regulations set forth by the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), any resource that is included in or eligible for
inclusion in the National Register is a “historic property.” “The term ‘eligible for inclusion in the
National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the
Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR §800.2 [e]).
The ACHP has set forth the following regulations to define significance and to determine
eligibility of cultural resources:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [39 CFR
Part 60].
43

Not only must a resource possess significance in order to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it
must also maintain a certain level of integrity. The National Register defines seven aspects of
integrity: (1) location, (2) association, (3) setting, (4) feeling, (5) workmanship, (6) design, and
(7) materials. Although not all seven aspects of integrity must be present for the resource to be
eligible, the resource must retain, overall, the defining features and characteristics that were
present during the property’s period of significance.
STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK CRITERIA
Under the Texas Antiquities Code at the state level, archeological sites may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following
Conditions is met:
(1) The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
(2) The archeological site is situated on private lands that have been specifically designated as an SAL
. . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

If a property is owned by the city, it technically meets SAL Condition 1, regarding political
subentities of Texas. At issue, however, is whether a site meeting that criterion is significant and
eligible for designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the National Register.
At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination of
whether a cultural resources property possesses the potential to make a contribution to one or
more of the above-defined criteria. The objective is to determine which cultural resources
properties could yield further data regarding regional, methodological, or theoretical research
questions. Therefore, adequate information on site function, context, integrity, and chronological
placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for
cultural investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography and temporal
period, determination of site context and chronological placement of the cultural properties is a
particularly important objective during the inventory process.

44

EVALUATION OF THE CULTURAL RESOURCES WITHIN THE APE
Site 41TR233
One archeological site (41TR233) was recorded within John M. Waggoman Park as a result of the
present survey. The site consists of a historic well belonging to early settler Jud Rowland that
was dedicated as a local landmark in 1987. Since the area surrounding the site consists of steep
slopes, the creek, and concrete walkway, two shovel tests were excavated north of the site. The
shovel tests revealed clay with carbonate nodules and gravel deposits, but no cultural materials.
Because of the extensive landscaping within the park, the site no longer maintains sufficient
integrity for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Thus, it is recommended that
site 41TR233 is not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for SAL designation. However, due to
significance that the well has at a local level, it is recommended that the proposed streamwidening project avoid affecting the site further.
Bridges and Culverts
A survey of the project area resulted in the identification of seven structures associated with the
Farmer’s Branch drainage: two culverts located on Redford Lane and Judd Street; four bridge
class culverts located on Las Vegas Trail, Pemberton Drive, Mirike Drive, and Meadow Park
Drive; and one bridge located on White Settlement Road (see Figure 3). The distinction between
a culvert, bridge class culvert, and a bridge is primarily in size and configuration. A culvert is a
structure under a roadway, usually for drainage, that has a clear opening of less than 20 feet
measured from the center line; however, it is classified as a bridge class culvert if it has a clear
opening of 20 feet or more measured along the centerline of the roadway between extreme ends
of the opening for multiple boxes or multiple pipes that are 60 in or more in diameter. A bridge is
defined as a structure, including supports, erected over a depression or an obstruction such as
water, a highway, or a railway; having a roadway or track for carrying traffic or other moving
loads; and having an opening measured along the center of the roadway of more than 20 feet
between faces of abutments (TxDOT 2009a).
Further analysis of historic aerials, topographic maps, and review of the TxDOT Bridge Inventory
and Inspection Files determined that two of the structures were built in or before 1959: the
culvert on Redford Lane and the culvert on Judd Street. As such, they meet NRHP criteria for
historic-age structures, and thus both identified historic-age resources were evaluated based on
four NRHP criteria as presented in 36 CFR Part 60.4 [a–d].
Redford Lane Culvert
Located on Redford Lane over Farmer’s Branch in White Settlement, Texas, is a six-pipe culvert
constructed ca. 1950. The culvert is approximately 60 feet long and 38 feet wide, has a concrete
slab, concrete substructure, and concrete and earth abutments (Figure 24).
The review of aerial photographs and historic maps determined that the culvert was most likely
constructed after the opening of the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation bomber factory in
1941. It was during this time that the city of White Settlement began paving streets with
concrete; however, due to metals being routed toward the war effort, it was common for road
45

structures, such as bridges and culverts, to be built of unreinforced concrete. Given the six-pipe
construction of the culvert, which provides the structure with the strength and stability to
withstand the weight of live loads, it is likely the culvert was built of unreinforced concrete.
Modifications to the structure include concrete abutments and the replacement of the deck ca.
1970 (Figure 25) (Historic Aerials 1956, 1963, 1970; White Settlement Museum n.d.).
Although the Redford Lane culvert has experienced some change in materials with the addition of
the abutments, the structure is a standing testament to the development of the area during World
War II and continues to be a functional road and drainage structure. Overall, the Redford Lane
culvert is in good condition and retains integrity of location, design, setting, feeling,
workmanship, and association.
The Redford Lane culvert meets the requirements of Criterion A demonstrating the pattern of
events associated with the development of the city of White Settlement. It is also an important
landscape feature that demonstrates the innovative solution faced by World War II engineers
working with limited resources and is a good representation of its type, meeting Criterion C
requirements. The Redford Lane culvert is therefore recommended eligible for listing in the
NRHP under Criteria A and C. If the Redford Lane culvert is to be affected by the proposed
project in any form or fashion, additional historic research is recommended.

Figure 25. Redford Lane culvert showing concrete abutments and replacement railing.

Judd Street Culvert
Located on Judd Street over Farmer’s Branch is a five pipe culvert constructed ca. 1959. The
culvert is approximately 25 feet long and 40 feet wide, has a concrete slab, and masonry
substructure (Figure 26). The road associated with the culvert has no railing on either side.
According to aerial photographs, the Judd Street culvert was constructed after a housing
development was placed on the north side of Farmer’s Branch ca. 1959 (Historic Aerials 1963).
The Judd Street culvert is in a deteriorated state and has lost integrity of design, materials,
workmanship, and feeling. The Judd Street culvert does not possess any known significant
historical association (Criterion A), it does not represent a pattern of events or historic trends in a
significant manner (Criterion B), nor does it demonstrate a high level of architectural or
engineering merit and design (Criterion C). Finally, the Judd Street culvert is not likely to yield
information important to history or prehistory (Criterion D). The Judd Street culvert does not
meet the requirements for Criterion A, B, C, or D and thus is recommended not eligible for listing
in the NRHP.
Las Vegas Trail Bridge Class Culvert
Located on Las Vegas Trail over Farmer’s Branch is a five-box bridge class culvert constructed
in 1970 (TxDOT Bridge Inventory and Inspection Files 2009b). The bridge class culvert is
approximately 49 feet long and 60 feet wide and has concrete wing-walls (Figure 27). There is
no railing on either side of the structure. The Las Vegas Trail bridge class culvert is not of
historic-age; therefore, it was not evaluated for NRHP eligibility.

Pemberton Drive Bridge Class Culvert
Located at Pemberton Drive over Farmer’s Branch is a five-box bridge class culvert constructed
in 1970 (TxDOT Bridge Inventory and Inspection Files 2009c). The bridge class culvert is
approximately 49 feet long and 40 feet wide, has concrete wing-walls, and metal railing along the
wing-walls (Figure 28). The Pemberton Drive bridge class culvert is not of historic-age;
therefore, it was not evaluated for NRHP eligibility.

28. Pemberton Drive bridge class culvert, facing southeast

Mirike Drive Bridge Class Culvert
Located at Mirike Drive over Farmer’s Branch is a five-box bridge class culvert constructed in
1970 (TxDOT Bridge Inventory and Inspection Files 2009d). The bridge class culvert is
approximately 49 feet long and 40 feet wide, has concrete wing-walls, and metal railing along the
both sides of the structure (Figure 29). The Mirike Drive bridge class culvert is not of historicage; therefore, it was not evaluated for NRHP eligibility.
Meadow Park Drive Bridge Class Culvert
Located on Meadow Park Drive over Farmer’s Branch is a five-box bridge class culvert
constructed in 1970 (TxDOT Bridge Inventory and Inspection Files 2009e). The bridge class
culvert is approximately 48 feet long and 49 feet wide and has metal railing along each side of the
road (Figure 30). The Meadow Park Drive bridge class culvert is not of historic-age; therefore, it
was not evaluated for NRHP eligibility.

White Settlement Road Bridge
Located on White Settlement Road over Farmer’s Branch is a four-span bridge constructed in
1991 (TxDOT Bridge Inventory and Inspection Files 2009f). The bridge is approximately 110
feet long and 58 feet wide, is supported by four concrete bents, and has metal railing along each
side of the road (Figure 31). The White Settlement Road bridge is not of historic-age; therefore,
it was not evaluated for NRHP eligibility.

CHAPTER 7
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

An intensive pedestrian survey of a portion of Farmer’s Branch within the city of White
Settlement in Tarrant County, Texas, was undertaken in September 2009 in conjunction with the
USACE, Fort Worth District, proposed modifications of the existing channels of Farmer’s Branch
and the Las Vegas Trail tributary of Farmer’s Branch to provide greater erosion control of the
streams. The project area consisted of a corridor measuring approximately 1.34 mi (2.2 km)
along Farmer’s Branch and Las Vegas Trail tributary within an APE that extended 100 ft (30 m)
from each side of the Farmer’s Branch channel and 50 ft (15 m) from the Las Vegas Trail
tributary channel.
Three historic-age resources—an archeological site and two drainage structures—were identified
during the cultural resources investigations. Archeological site 41TR233, a historic well
belonging to early settler Jud Rowland, was identified within the project APE. The site consists
of the remains of the well within the John M. Waggoman Park. The landscape has been
extensively modified in this area, and the site is recommended not eligible for NRHP inclusion or
for SAL designation. Nevertheless, the site bears a local historic significance, and it is
recommended that the stream-widening project avoid further damage to the well.
The identified historic-age drainage structures (i.e., at least 50 years in age) were the Redford
Lane and Judd Street culverts. The Judd Street culvert, built ca. 1959, is a five-pipe structure of
concrete and masonry construction in a state of extreme deterioration. This culvert is
recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because it has lost integrity of design,
materials, workmanship, and feeling. The Redford Lane culvert was constructed ca. 1950 and is
a six-pipe culvert of unreinforced concrete. The culvert maintains integrity and is recommended
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A and C. It is also recommended that additional
historic research be undertaken if the culvert at Redford Lane is to be affected in any way by the
proposed stream-widening project.
No additional work is recommended for the remainder of the project area. The majority of the
sediments within the APE were found to consist of high-energy gravel bar deposits that do not
favor the preservation of archeological materials. Additionally, the APE has been affected by
urban development, which has been detrimental to the depositional integrity of the sediments
within the project area.
