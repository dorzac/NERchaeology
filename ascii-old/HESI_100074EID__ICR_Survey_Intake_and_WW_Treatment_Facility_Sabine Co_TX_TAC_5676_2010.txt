MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 23 and 24 June 2010, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the Area of Potential Effect (APE) of a proposed G-M
Water Supply Corporation (G-M WSC) water system improvement project in Sabine County,
Texas. Specifically, the water system improvement project consists of: 1) a 5.0-acre surface
water treatment facility; 2) a surface water intake structure on Lowes Creek; and 3)
approximately 1.0 miles (1.6 kilometers [km]) of raw water transmission line to connect the
intake structure to the treatment facility. Because the various project features will be owned and
maintained by G-M WSC, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). In addition, the project will be funded in part by a loan issued by the Texas Water
Development Board (TWDB) through its Drinking Water State Revolving Fund-Disadvantaged
Community Program. As these monies are ultimately derived from federal funding sources, the
undertaking is also regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended. At the request of Schaumburg & Polk, Inc. (SPI), Horizon conducted the
cultural resources survey on behalf of G-M WSC. The survey was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number 5676 in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of
the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the project’s APE
and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for formal designation as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs) and for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The survey of the APE resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were
observed on the surface of the APE or within any of the 30 excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the construction of G-M WSC’s surface water treatment facility, intake structure, and water
transmission line will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further
investigations are warranted for the project. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of G-M WSC’s Proposed Surface Water Treatment Facility and
Intake Structure Project in Sabine County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey
conducted within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) of a proposed G-M Water Supply
Corporation (G-M WSC) water system improvement project in Sabine County, Texas (Figures 1
and 2). Specifically, the water system improvement project consists of: 1) a 5.0-acre surface
water treatment facility; 2) a surface water intake structure on Lowes Creek; and 3)
approximately 1.0 miles (1.6 kilometers [km]) of raw water transmission line to connect the
intake structure to the treatment facility. Because the various project features will be owned and
maintained by G-M WSC, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). In addition, the project will be funded in part by a loan issued by the Texas Water
Development Board (TWDB) through its Drinking Water State Revolving Fund-Disadvantaged
Community Program. As these monies are ultimately derived from federal funding sources, the
undertaking is also regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended. At the request of Schaumburg & Polk, Inc. (SPI), Horizon Environmental
Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources survey on behalf of G-M WSC. The
survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number 5676 in
compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological
sites were located within the project’s APE and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for
formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the APE, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State
Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal Investigator for the
project.
Rosemarie Pavel and Ryan Schuermann (Horizon archeological technicians)
conducted the field investigations on 23 and 24 June 2010.
The survey of the APE consisted of both intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre on projects between 2 and 10 acres in size. As such, a
minimum of 10 shovel tests were necessary within the 5.0-acre water treatment facility tract. In
addition, the TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on linear projects. As the

proposed water transmission line right-of-way (ROW) measures approximately 1.0 miles in
length, a minimum of 16 shovel tests were necessary along the proposed ROW. The location of
the proposed intake structure on Lowes Creek will measure less than 0.5 acres in size, thereby
requiring a minimum of 2 shovel tests. In all, a minimum of 28 shovel tests were necessary
within the overall APE in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the minimum
survey standards by excavating a total of 30 shovel tests within the APE.
The survey of the APE resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were
observed on the surface of any of the 30 excavated shovel tests. Based on the negative results
of the cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of G-M WSC’s
surface water treatment facility, intake structure, and water transmission line will have no impact
on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted for the project.
Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The APE of G-M WSC’s current water system improvement project will include a 5.0acre tract where a new 0.5-million-gallon-per-day (mgd) surface water treatment plant will be
constructed, a new surface water intake structure at Lowes Creek on Toledo Bend, and
approximately 1.0 miles of water transmission line to connect the 2 structures (see Figures 1
and 2). The overall APE is located approximately 8.0 miles (12.9 km) northeast of Hemphill,
Texas, and can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Salter Creek, Texas,
and Negreet SW, Texas, topographic quadrangles (see Figure 1). The proposed surface water
treatment plant will be located at the northeast corner of the intersection of Farm-to-Market
Road (FM) 3382 and FM 83 E. The water transmission line right-of-way (ROW) will extend
along the existing ROW of FM 83 E, terminating at the proposed surface water intake structure
on the Lowes Creek arm of Toledo Bend. Photographs of the APE are presented in Figures 3
through 6.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed project area is located in a remote, rural area in eastern Sabine County in
east Texas. The APE is situated in a somewhat undulating area just north of Lowes Creek.
Elevations within the surface water treatment tract range from approximately 180 to 190 feet
above mean sea level (amsl), while the intake structure sits at an elevation of approximately 175
feet amsl. The water transmission line ROW between these 2 structures extends over a small
rise between the 2 and has elevations ranging between 175 and 220 feet amsl. Hydrologically,
the APE is situated within the Sabine River basin. The entire APE drains southward into Lowes
Creek, and Lowes Creek empties to the east into Toledo Bend Reservoir, the largest artificial
reservoir on the Sabine River.

2.3

CLIMATE

The environment in Northeast Texas has not remained the same throughout the ca.
12,000 years during which humans have lived in the region. Archeological, faunal, geological,
and pollen evidence suggests that significant changes have occurred, and these changes have
major implications for the development and maintenance of human adaptive strategies in the
region (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). At present, these changes are poorly understood as only
limited evidence of past environments prior to ca. 3,000 years ago has been obtained (Bryant
and Holloway 1985; Collins and Bousman 1990; Story 1990).

Chapter 2.0: Project Area Description

Evidence for climatic change from the late Pleistocene to the present is most often
obtained through studies of pollen sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985). Few pollen studies
have been conducted in Northeast Texas—to date, only a few studies from Buck Creek Marsh
and Jewett Mine have provided interpretable pollen data from this portion of the state (Jacobs
1991; Scott-Cummings 1991), but these are poorly dated or have serious gaps in their records.
Nevertheless, an important series of pollen sites occur in areas surrounding Northeast Texas
(cf. Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). The best dated and most informative pollen sequences come
from Boriack Bog in Lee County and Weakly Bog in Leon County (Bryant 1969, 1977; Holloway
and Bryant 1984; Holloway et al. 1987). The radiocarbon dates from Boriack Bog suggest a
regular accumulation of deposits and indicate that Boriack Bog surface sediments are
approximately 3,000 years old. Bryant (1977) indicates that the bog was drained and the
surface peat was excavated in the 20th century; thus, the surface of the peat was lowered to
sediments of that age. Weakly Bog, by contrast, covers the last 3,000 years or so, and the
bottom samples roughly match the younger portion of Boriack Bog. Thus, Boriack and Weakly
bogs cumulatively provide a general picture of vegetation change throughout most of the late
Pleistocene and Holocene periods for this region of Texas.
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for East Texas that
includes 3 separate climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.),
the Late Glacial Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to
present). Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. The limited available evidence suggests
that the region was more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods and
that, prior to ca. 10,000 years B.P., it was forested with species that prefer cool, temperate
conditions, including boreal taxa such as spruce (Bryant and Holloway 1985). This late
Pleistocene/early Holocene climate is inferred to have been cooler than today, with increased
precipitation and/or more effective moisture, but with perhaps less seasonal climatic constraints.
The Late Glacial Period was characterized by a slow warming and/or drying trend (Collins 2004)
during which the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak
savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial Period, the environment appears to have been more stable.
During the early Holocene (ca. 10,000 to 7000 B.P.), warmer temperatures prevailed, with less
moisture and presumably a lower density of forest cover. The deciduous forests were replaced
by prairies and post oak savannas. Collins and Bousman (1990) suggest that significant
expanses of grassland were present along the western edge of the Northeast Texas region.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. In the middle Holocene, the period between
ca. 7000 and 4000 B.P., much drier and warmer conditions may have characterized the region’s
climate, possibly resulting in even more widespread grasslands and replacement of forests
along its western edge. The forest cover in Northeast Texas is suspected to have been at its
lowest density during this time period (Collins and Bousman 1990:62).

Intake Structure Project in Sabine County, Texas

Following the warm and dry interlude of the middle Holocene, environmental data
suggest that a gradual reforestation of the region continued into the late Holocene (ca.
4000 B.P. to present). Collins and Bousman (1990) suggest that prairie areas were replaced
first by oak savanna, then by oak-hickory forest in the western part of the region and by oakhickory-pine forest in the eastern portions of the region. Bryant and Holloway (1985) suggest
that essentially modern environmental conditions in Northeast Texas were probably achieved by
about 1,500 years ago.
Stable carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen isotope analyses are becoming
increasingly important sources of information about past climatic conditions and changes. A
14,000-year stable isotopic record from the Aubrey Site in the Trinity River Basin in NorthCentral Texas documents changing climatic conditions with wetter (and perhaps slightly cooler)
or more humid climates from ca. 11,000 to 7500 B.P., again between 4000 and 2000 B.P., and
yet again after 1,000 years ago (Humphrey and Ferring 1994; Perttula 2004:371). Conversely,
the Aubrey Site record suggests periods of warmer-than-present climate between 7,500 and
4,000 years ago and between about 2,000 and 1,000 years ago. Interestingly, fossil vertebrate,
pollen, and stable isotope data from Central Texas and the Edwards Plateau tell a somewhat
different story, highlighting 2 dry climatic peaks between ca. 7000 and 3000/2500 B.P. and after
1,000 years ago (Toomey et al. 1993; Perttula 2004:371). The timing and nature of such
climatic changes have major implications regarding the relative position of the prairie-forest
border, the possible presence or absence of bison, and the natural resource potential of the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna.
The modern climate of the region is characterized as humid subtropical, with warm,
humid weather from the spring to the fall, and cool, humid weather in the fall and winter. The
climate is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is
modified by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring,
summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental
climate characterized by considerable variations in temperature. Summers are long and warm.
Winters are short and mild and are characterized by short periods of clear, cold, or freezing
weather interspersed with cloudy and rainy periods and clear, pleasant days. Extremely hot or
cold temperatures are rare. Sudden temperature changes are not very common during
summer, but may occur frequently in winter. Rapid drops in winter temperature are caused by
cold waves or sudden, strong north winds, though freezing weather is uncommon. Average
winter temperatures range between 35 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and average summer
temperatures range from 85 to 95°F. Valleys and low divides are often covered with frost on
early winter mornings, but freezing temperatures are of short duration. The average frost-free
season is 246 days (March 15 to November 16) (Bomar 1983).
The region is well watered—precipitation falls rather uniformly over the area and is fairly
well distributed throughout the year. Normally, it is heaviest in December, March, April, and
May, and lowest in August. Rainfall varies from year to year, but the average is about
45 inches. Torrential rains fall occasionally, especially in winter and spring, and light snows fall
occasionally in winter but melt rapidly. Hailstorms are infrequent but do occur in the vicinity of
the project area. Precipitation generally increases from north to south across the region and

HJN 100074 EID

15

Chapter 2.0: Project Area Description

decreases from east to west in a clinal pattern. The wettest counties in the area (Shelby,
Sabine, and San Augustine) receive more than 48 inches of annual precipitation, while the
driest counties (Fannin, Henderson, and Anderson) receive between 36 and 40 inches of
precipitation each year. Droughts are not uncommon, and periods of lower summer
precipitation are often accompanied by extended droughts caused by warm continental Pacific
air masses moving across the area from the west.
Dendrochronological analyses of tree rings suggest that numerous wet and dry spells
occurred during the last 1,000 years (Stahle and Cleaveland 1994, 1995). Dry conditions and
the worst droughts occurred in the late A.D. 1200s, in the mid-1400s and 1600s, and then again
in the mid-1700s (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995). Stahle et al. (1985) suggest that the worst
June drought to occur in the past 450 years occurred during the period between A.D. 1549 and
1577. More favorable conditions probably occurred during the intervening years, especially
between ca. A.D. 1390 and 1440, then in the late part of the 16th and early 17th centuries
(Perttula 2004:371). Such climatic perturbations presumably affected the predictability and
success of maize harvests during the Caddoan occupation of the Pineywoods and neighboring
Post Oak Savanna (Perttula 2004:371). Similar fluctuations throughout the Holocene would
also have affected the range, distribution, and abundance of naturally occurring plants and
animals upon which non-agricultural human populations relied.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Northeast Texas Archeological Region is situated within the Austroriparian biotic
province (Blair 1950). This province includes the Gulf Coastal Plain from the Atlantic Ocean to
eastern Texas. Its western boundary, which is approximated by a line running north from
western Harris County to western Red River County (Dice 1943), is the western boundary of the
main body of pine and hardwood forests of the eastern Gulf Coastal Plain. In Texas,
Austroriparian vegetation consists of 2 vegetation regions, the long-leaf pine and pine-oak forest
regions. The project area is situated in a forested upland environment within the mixed pinehardwood forest section of the Pineywoods vegetation region.
Before the advent of the lumber industry in the 1880s, the area was covered by forests
of immense trees. Though these forests have since been destroyed by more than a century of
intensive logging, many areas are now reforested, and much of the region is dotted with
reforested pine and hardwood forests. Forested uplands within the project area generally
consist of a mix of hardwood and pine stands with dense understories composed of trees,
shrubs, and vines. These areas are typically dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), shortleaf
pine (Pinus echinata), water oak (Quercus nigra), post oak (Quercus stellata), southern red oak
(Quercus falcata), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), winged elm (Ulmus alata), eastern red
cedar (Juniperus virginiana), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), American beautyberry
(Callicarpa americana), and blackberry (Rhubus sp.). Upland shrubland consists of small tree
species such as various elms, various oaks, sweet gum, and pine, as well as a variety of shrub
species such as eastern false-willow, sumac (Rhus sp.), Mexican plum (Prunus mexicana), and
rusty blackhaw (Viburnum rufidulum). Upland grasslands are dominated by bermudagrass
(Cynodon dactylon), nettles (Solanum spp.), and yankeeweed (Eupatorium compositifolium).

2.5

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The project area is situated within the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Sedimentary bedrock formations of limestone and sandstone
laid down during the Cretaceous Period parallel the margins of the ancient, receding coastline of
the Gulf of Mexico and crop out as cuestas or escarpments across the generally southward dip
of the modern land surface (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Little internal relief of over 50 m
(164 ft) occurs except along the eroded fronts of the cuestas and in the ironstone hills (Fisher
1965; Godfrey et al. 1973).
Soils in Northeast Texas are divided into 2 broad groups—upland soils and alluvial
valley soils (Godfrey et al. 1973). Upland soils support tall grasses and hardwoods and tend to
form directly on bedrock, except where colluvial deposition has occurred during the Quaternary
Period. These soils vary from moist, acidic soils with a sandy to loamy surface horizon and
clayey subsoil to soils whose basic loamy surface horizons overlie clay-enriched B-horizons.
Bone and shell preservation is common in archeological deposits in the latter soils (Story
1990:9). Mixed hardwood and pine forests occur on the acidic upland soils in Northeast Texas.
Tall-grass prairie occurs on the dark, clayey soils of the Blackland Prairie to the west of the
project area (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993).
As a region, Northeast Texas exhibits relatively little topographic relief. The bedrock is
exclusively sedimentary and is not very resistant to erosion. Drainage is well developed,
including major river systems that arise outside of the region (i.e., Red and Trinity) as well as
within it (i.e., Angelina, Attoyac, Cypress, Neches, Sabine, and Sulphur). Much of Northeast
Texas is dominated by fluvial transport systems in which streams tend to meander within their
valleys, locally cutting into the outer banks of bends and depositing sediment packages against
the inner banks of bends (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Valley soils are important
archeologically because they often contain stratified cultural deposits, usually in association with
buried, cumulic soils. Point bars, levees, and flood basins are distinctive geomorphic features
that share the common attribute of active aggradation. In theory, archeological sites may be
expected to form in such landforms and, depending on the rates of sedimentation and human
occupation, may develop internal stratification. To date, however, most archeological surveys
conducted along streams in Northeast Texas have documented almost no sites on levees or
point bars (Hsu 1969; Anderson et al. 1974; Bruseth et al. 1977). The low density of recorded
archeological sites in such areas likely results from the low site visibility and difficult survey
conditions. The low number of archeological sites recorded in these drainages is almost
certainly a function of the difficulty of surveying floodplain environments partially covered by
impenetrable swamps (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993; Perttula 2004:370).
Natural lakes, ponds, and swamps are also common features of Northeast Texas
floodplains, and they typically represent sections of abandoned channels of rivers and streams
that have not been filled by alluvial deposits (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Lakes generally
contain some open water, marshes are heavily vegetated (usually with grasses) but do not form
peat, and bogs are waterlogged and spongy areas in which mosses and other decaying
vegetation produce an acidic environment conducive to peat development. Lakes, ponds, and

HJN 100074 EID

17

Chapter 2.0: Project Area Description

marshes in Northeast Texas are generally of fresh water and form aerobic, basic
environments—they may contain excellent stratigraphic records and preserved bone, though
they are not conducive to botanical preservation. Bogs, on the other hand, are anaerobic,
acidic, and may have remained saturated over long periods of time. Such environments are
optimal for the preservation of normally perishable artifacts (Chelf 1946) as well as the entire
spectrum of natural organic remains (Bryant 1989). Bog material is suitable for direct
radiocarbon dating, and the 2 pollen cores upon which much of the palynological record of
Northeast Texas is based were obtained from the Boriack and Weakly bogs in Lee and Leon
counties, respectively (Bryant 1969, 1977; Holloway and Bryant 1984; Holloway et al. 1987).
Valley margins in Northeast Texas streams include colluvial slopes and occasional
alluvial fans. Such geomorphic features represent areas of natural deposition that may be well
suited to some kinds of human activity, a combination favoring the formation of stratified
archeological sites (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). The lower reaches of such features afford
high ground adjacent to flood basin resources, and archeologists commonly find sites in these
settings in Northeast Texas.
Aeolian landscape features pose a somewhat more complicated scenario in Northeast
Texas (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). These are extensive surficial sand deposits that are
subject to modification by wind at any time that vegetative cover is disrupted. Some indications
of aeolian modification of sand deposits have been noted in and near the region (e.g., Gunn and
Brown 1982; Mandel 1987; Perttula et al. 1986), but the validity of some of these interpretations,
the possible extent of Quaternary aeolian-modified landscapes, and the timing of any increased
aeolian activity are in question.

Intake Structure Project in Sabine County, Texas

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Northeast Texas Archeological Region, a
subdivision of the THC’s Eastern Planning Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). The cultural
history of Northeast Texas can be subdivided into 9 broad temporal periods, although the
historic period has been differentiated into overlapping Historic Caddoan and Historic
EuroAmerican periods to distinguish between the highly divergent historical experiences of the
indigenous Native Americans and EuroAmerican settlers during the settlement of Texas
(Table 2).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9500 TO 7000 B.C.)

The initial human occupation of the New World can be confidently extended back before
10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Lynch 1990; Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft
Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans were present in Eastern North America as
early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al. 1990), while more recent discoveries at
Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for human occupation in South America by
at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer et al. 1997). Most archeologists
presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation in North America during the
Pleistocene glacial period.
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Northeast Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (ca. 9500 to 7000 B.C.) (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This period
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred endscrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns are known primarily
through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of small animals,
fish, and shellfish during the PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in Northeast Texas for
hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in North America; rather, a
broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced until the Late Prehistoric
period.
The distribution of PaleoIndian artifacts within the region suggests that these early
aboriginal occupations were principally situated within the valleys of major stream basins
(Anderson 1996; Perttula 2004:373; Thurmond 1990) as well as in resource-rich areas like the
Ouachita Mountains escarpment to the north (Anderson 1996). Anderson (1996) hypothesizes
that the initial and most intensive PaleoIndian settlement of the Southeast (including Northeast
Texas) occurred in the resource-rich valleys of the Mississippi River and its principal tributaries.
From there, PaleoIndian groups spread throughout the wooded Southeast and East, with
concentrations at 250-to-400-km (155-to-249-mi) intervals. The relatively sparse PaleoIndian
archeological record, combined with the dispersion of artifacts across many different landforms
and physiographic settings, seems to indicate that PaleoIndian groups were highly mobile,
generalized hunters and gatherers rather than specialized hunters of extinct megafauna (Fields
and Tomka 1993), as has been inferred for PaleoIndian populations on the Great Plains.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 7000 TO 200 B.C.)

Throughout most of North America, the onset of the hypothesized Hypsithermal drying
trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period (ca. 7000 to 200 B.P.) (Perttula and Kenmotsu
1993). In many regions, this climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation of
lifestyle—the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the big game
populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base composed of
smaller game and wild plants. In Northeast Texas, however, a generalized hunting and
gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory prior to the advent of large-scale
agricultural systems during the Late Prehistoric.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture have been noted as well. Johnson
(1962) employs archeological data from the Yarbrough site (41VN6) on the upper Sabine River
to bring chronological order to the diverse Archaic archeological record in Northeast Texas.
Johnson’s (1962) temporal divisions are based on projectile point sequences and on the
introduction of plain ceramics at the end of the Archaic period. More recent refinements of the
projectile point sequence (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990) document straight and expanding-stem

Intake Structure Project in Sabine County, Texas

forms characteristic of the Early and Middle Archaic subperiods and contracting-stem darts
during the Late Archaic and subsequent Early Ceramic periods (Schambach 1982, 1998).

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (CA. 200 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The Early Ceramic period (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800), also known as the Woodland
period, is characterized in much of Northeast Texas, especially from the Sabine to the Red
rivers, primarily by plain, relatively thick ceramic bowls and flowerpot-shaped jars, double-bitted
axe heads, smaller and thinner versions of Gary dart points, and later in the period by cornernotched arrow points (Thurmond 1990). Early Ceramic sites along the Red River in
southwestern Arkansas and in Northeast Texas have abundant ceramics, though many sites of
this age, especially between the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, do not evince such prevalent use of
ceramics (Perttula 2004:376). This situation suggests regional differences in food processing
technologies and/or dietary habits, and may further highlight differences in the degree of
sedentism among populations across the area (Skibo and Blinman 1999). Lower Mississippi
Valley ceramic styles (e.g., Tchefuncte Stamped, Churupa Punctated, Marksville Incised,
Troyville Stamped, and Marksville Stamped) occur with some regularity at sites in the Sabine,
Sulphur, and Big Cypress basins (Story 1990). These ceramics may provide evidence of
contact and interaction between Trans-Mississippi South and Lower Mississippi Valley
populations, or they may represent the adoption of Lower Mississippi Valley stylistic and
decorative attributes by local potters (Perttula and Bruseth 1995; Schambach 1982, 1998).
The Early Ceramic inhabitants of Northeast Texas were still primarily hunter-gatherers,
though they may have lived in increasingly large groups and/or resided for longer periods of
time at certain sites (Perttula 2004:377). Larger villages and multiple mound centers begin to
be constructed during this period on the major streams (e.g., the Red and Sabine rivers). Some
sites have relatively substantial midden deposits, particularly along the Red River and in the
upper Sulphur River basin (Fields et al. 1997; Schambach 1982), and some evidence for
structures (probably daubed pole and thatch structures), but the degree of settlement
permanence is still less than that seen in the subsequent, long-term, Caddoan settlements of
Northeast Texas (Perttula et al. 1993:99).
On the basis of available paleobotanical information, Early Ceramic groups may have
cultivated squash (McGregor 1996) and used native seeds, tubers, and roots in addition to a
variety of woodland and aquatic animal resources (Webb et al. 1969). The presence of chipped
stone axes and hoe-shaped tools in Early Ceramic occupations suggests that some level of
horticultural activity was occurring, though intensive use of colonizing weedy annuals may
similarly account for the presence of these implements. Bruseth (1998) has suggested that
maize was being cultivated during the latter portions of this period, but stable isotope analyses
of some 25 or more Late Archaic, Fourche Maline, and Formative to Early Caddoan human
remains indicate that maize was not a major part of the diet at this time (Rose et al. 1998).
Early Ceramic period burial mounds have been documented in bluff top and alluvial valley
settings on the Red River in northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas (Schambach
1982, 1997; Webb 1984) and on the Angelina, Neches, and Sabine rivers in Northeast Texas
(Story 1990). Mortuary ceremonialism included the interment of costly, non-local raw materials

HJN 100074 EID

21

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

and artifacts, including chert, copper, and Lower Mississippi Valley ceramic vessels, in the burial
mounds. Evidence of mortuary or ritual practices also occurs in non-mound contexts such as
the Hurricane Hill Site, which contained a small cemetery on a prominent hill, and the Mahaffey
Site on the Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma, which had a large cemetery with flexed
and semiflexed burials without grave goods (Perino and Bennett 1978). In the broadest sense,
the establishment of bounded cemeteries is often interpreted as a correlate of increasing
sedentism in the western Gulf Coastal Plain of Northeast Texas (Perttula 2004:378).

3.4

FORMATIVE, EARLY, AND MIDDLE CADDOAN PERIODS (CA. A.D. 800 TO 1400)

The Caddoan archeological record represents the fluorescence of aboriginal complex
societies in northeastern Texas, northwestern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas, and
southeastern Oklahoma, and generations of archeologists have long been captivated by the
beautifully manufactured ceramics and other material goods, the earthen mounds, the wellpreserved villages and hamlets, and the existence of a paleobotanical record (e.g., Perttula
2004; Swanton 1942). In the Northeast Texas Archeological Region, the timeframe referred to
in many surrounding regions as the Late Prehistoric period is usually subdivided into the
Formative Caddoan (ca. A.D. 800 to 1000), the Early Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1000 to 1200), the
Middle Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400), and the Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680) periods
(Perttula 1993a). European contact with Caddoan groups in Northeast Texas began around ca.
A.D. 1540, but it was sporadic until after ca. A.D. 1680 (Perttula 1992), and the Historic
Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1680 to 1860) therefore covers the period of regular interaction with
Spanish, French, and other EuroAmerican settlers up to the expulsion of the Caddo peoples
from their homelands and forced removal to Indian Territory in 1859. General characteristics of
Caddoan tradition are discussed below.
In general terms, the Caddo were characterized by:
…a large population represented by many small settlements scattered within particular
resource areas; a reliance upon horticulture as one of the primary means of subsistence;
differentiated and undifferentiated mound/habitation sites with structurally differentiated
mound classes (producing an apparently hierarchic division of places on the landscape);
differential treatment of the dead reflective of a system of ranking; [and] indications of
long-term cooperation in disposal of the dead by groups represented by some of the
archeological units (Prewitt 1974:76).

Broadly, these basic characteristics of settlement, subsistence, sociopolitical organization, and
mortuary practices are representative of the Caddoan archeological area from ca. A.D. 750 to
1750 and are similar, if not identical, to what constitutes the Mississippian period cultural
traditions of the Mississippi River Valley and Eastern Woodlands of North America (Griffin 1967,
1985; Smith 1990). Despite these similarities, Caddoan archeologists maintain that the
prehistoric and early historic Caddoan tradition developed largely independently of
Mississippian-period chiefdoms elsewhere (Smith 1990).
Formative to Middle Caddoan period groups seem to have been horticulturalists,
cultivating maize and squash along with several kinds of native seeds (Perttula and Bruseth
1983). They also gathered nuts, tubers, and roots and were proficient hunters of deer, fish,

22

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of G-M WSC’s Proposed Surface Water Treatment Facility and
Intake Structure Project in Sabine County, Texas

rabbits, raccoon, turkey, squirrel, and turtles. Available paleobotanical and bioarcheological
evidence from Northeast Texas and elsewhere within the Caddoan area, including stable
carbon isotope analyses of human remains (Rose et al. 1998), suggests that Caddoan groups
became dependent primarily upon maize and other domesticated crops only after about
A.D. 1300. By ca. A.D. 1450, maize comprised more than 50% of the diet (Burnett 1990;
Perttula 1996; Rose et al. 1998), though local variation in dependence upon cultivated plants
has been noted (Cliff 1997; Largent et al. 1997; Perttula 1999).
The most distinctive material culture item of the Caddo populations living in Northeast
Texas was the ceramics they made for cooking, storage, and serving needs (Perttula et al.
1995). The variety of styles and forms of ceramics recovered from the region hint at the range,
temporal span, and geographic extent of prehistoric Caddoan groups across the landscape
(Thurmond 1990). Story (1990:246-247, 277-319) suggests that the earliest ceramics in the
region date between ca. 500 and 100 B.C. and are closely related to the ceramics being
produced in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Between the introduction of ceramics in the region
and the emergence of distinctive Caddoan vessel forms and decorative motifs around A.D. 800,
the local plainware traditions seem to have continued relatively unchanged.
Aside from ceramics, Formative to Middle Caddoan period populations in the
Pineywoods possessed a sophisticated technology based on the use of stone, bone, wood,
shell, and other media for the manufacture of tools, clothing, basketry, ornaments, and other
items (Perttula 1992:15). Well-made corner-notched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points
were common, along with siltstone and greenstone celts, perforators and borers, large Gahagan
bifaces, and a variety of more expedient stone tools, such as unifacial flake scraping and cutting
implements (Perttula 2004:386). Long-stemmed Red River (Hoffman 1967) and cigar-shaped
ceramic pipes, as well as ceramic earspools and figurines, were also manufactured by the
Caddo at this time (Newell and Krieger 1949).
Locally available lithic materials were usually employed for the manufacture of stone
tools, but non-local raw materials and finished goods made from these raw materials were also
obtained through trade (Brown 1983; Perttula 1990). The development and maintenance of
long-distance east-to-west and north-to-south trade networks were notable features of
prehistoric Caddoan tradition. Trade items included bison hides and salt; raw materials such as
copper, stone, and marine shell; and finished objects such as pottery vessels and large
ceremonial bifaces (Brown 1983; Creel 1991; Early 1990; Vehik 1988, 1990). Many of the more
exotic trade items, especially marine shell and copper artifacts, were obtained from areas more
than 186 km (300 mi) away from the Caddoan area (Perttula 1992).

3.5

LATE CADDOAN PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1400 TO 1680)

As currently defined, the Late Caddoan period extends from ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680
(Story 1990). Late Caddoan occupation in Northeast Texas was arguably centered on the
Great Bend area of the Red River, where Late Caddoan archeological sites are included in the
contemporaneous Belcher and Texarkana phases (Schambach 1983). Texarkana phase sites
occur on the Red River northwest of Texarkana to the Arkansas-Oklahoma state line, as well on
the lower Sulphur River (Jelks 1961), while Belcher phase sites are distributed from about

HJN 100074 EID

23

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Fulton, Arkansas, to below Shreveport, Louisiana (Kelley 1997; Schambach 1983; Webb 1959).
The McCurtain phase represents another Late Caddoan archeological complex upstream from
the Texarkana phase (Bruseth 1998). Texarkana and Belcher phase sites include large,
permanent settlements with mounds, cemeteries, hamlets, and farmsteads (Perttula 2004:393).
The mound centers were marked by the construction of earthen mounds used as temples, burial
mounds, and/or ceremonial fire mounds, as during earlier Caddoan periods (Kelley 1998; Webb
1959). These settlements were inhabited by sedentary Caddo agricultural communities with
complex societies led by individuals with high status (Story 1990).
Late Caddoan period settlements in the Pineywoods of Northeast Texas have been
termed rural Caddoan community systems (Perttula 1991) because they were distributed along
secondary streams, were widely dispersed, and consisted of functionally equivalent farmsteads
and hamlets. Small mound centers were being constructed by Titus phase and other Late
Caddoan groups up until ca. A.D. 1500, and possibly later, in Northeast Texas, but they lack
evidence of burial mounds or large platforms; rather, these mounds contain buried, burned
structures (Perttula 2004:398). The larger Caddoan towns were distributed along the major
stream valleys, such as the Red, Ouachita, and Little rivers. These communities were
hierarchically arranged, with civic-ceremonial centers at the “top” surrounded by associated
towns of linear but dispersed farmstead compounds with several structures (such as bark- or
brush-covered shelters and storage platforms) (Schambach 1983:7-8), followed by hamlets,
farmsteads, and specialized processing and/or procurement locales, such as salt-making sites
(Early 1993; Gregory 1980:356-357).
Faunal subsistence remains are known from a few sites in Northeast Texas dating to this
time period but have so far received relatively little attention (Perttula 1993a; Thurmond 1990).
Vertebrate species represented in trash middens include deer, turkey, cottontail rabbit,
jackrabbit, squirrel, beaver, turtle, and fish, though deer and turkey appear to have been the
dominant economic species (Perttula et al. 1982; 1993). In general, subsistence evidence
suggests that Pineywoods Caddo practiced a strongly maize-based economy at this time (Fritz
1990:421, 425). Floral evidence from trash midden deposits suggests that maize (Zea mays)
provided a dietary staple, and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were also an important food source
(Perttula 2004:4005). Nuts and seeds were gathered but appear to have been of lesser
importance than during earlier time periods (Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Perttula et
al. 1982).
By early historic times, the Caddoan nation comprised at least 25 separate groups,
bands, or tribes organized into loosely affiliated kin-based groups referred to by European
observers as the Hasinai, Kadohadacho, and Natchitoches confederacies (Perttula 1992). The
Hasinai groups lived in the Angelina and Neches river valleys in East Texas, the Kadohadacho
groups on the Red River in the Great Bend area, and the Natchitoches groups on the Red River
in the vicinity of the French trading post of Natchitoches established in A.D. 1714.

3.6

HISTORIC CADDOAN PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1519 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico (Weddle 1985). While no

24

100074 - arch survey report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of G-M WSC’s Proposed Surface Water Treatment Facility and
Intake Structure Project in Sabine County, Texas

documentary evidence exists for direct contact with Caddoan peoples during these initial forays,
Europeans were already conducting slave raiding and native resettlement projects along the
Texas coast by 1550 (Bolton 1912). From 1528 to 1534, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and
other survivors of the Narváez Florida expedition crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked
along the Texas coast near Galveston Bay (Bandelier 1964). Swanton (1942:29) does not
believe that Cabeza de Vaca actually encountered any Caddoan people during his wanderings,
though his dealings in Native American trade goods between coastal and inland groups suggest
that he might have traveled in the region (Perttula 1992:19). While direct contact between
Cabeza de Vaca and Caddoan peoples cannot be established by historical documentation,
Perttula (1992) argues that diseases such as typhoid and measles carried by the Narváez party
could have been transmitted to Native American groups living elsewhere along the Texas Coast
and then inland to Caddoan groups through aboriginal trade and other contact. Thus, the
Narváez and Cabeza de Vaca exploration may have been an important benchmark for the
initiation of contact between Europeans and Native Americans in the Spanish Borderlands West
(Hester 1989:199; Perttula 1992:19, 1993b), and may have introduced epidemic diseases that
resulted in substantial population declines prior to the inception of more regular contact later in
the 16th century.
In the early 1540s, the Hernando de Soto entrada, led by Luis de Moscoso following the
death of de Soto along the Mississippi River near present-day Memphis, passed into the
Caddoan area, spending several months among the Caddoan groups who lived between the
Ouachita and Trinity rivers (Swanton 1939; Perttula 1992:19). The death of de Soto on the
Mississippi River at the province of Guachoya in the spring of 1542:
…freed the survivors from continuing upon the original objectives of the expedition.
There was only one thought shared by all: to escape from the whole dreadful adventure.
Under the leadership of Luis de Moscoso, they officially decided it was hopeless to seek
the sea…in fact, the cavaliers were clearly reluctant to take to boats…and instead
determined to march west in the direction of New Spain (Brain 1985:xlv).

Within what is now recognized as the Caddoan archeological area, Moscoso described
the provinces of Naguatex, Nondacao, and Guasco, for example, as groups that had dense
populations in scattered settlements and abundant reserves of maize (Swanton 1939:258-280).
Perttula’s (1992) examination of Moscoso’s travels suggests that his route passed through
settlements of aboriginal Caddoan groups known archeologically as the Late Mid-Ouachita (or
Social Hill), Belcher, Texarkana, Titus, and Frankston phases. Different versions of Moscoso’s
route have been proposed by various researchers (e.g., Hudson 1986; Perttula 1992; Swanton
1939). The basic import of the de Soto-Moscoso expedition in 1542 is that these explorers
documented and described aspects of Caddoan settlement, subsistence strategies, aboriginal
routes of travel and trade, and social organization that are broadly consistent with inferences
that have been made based on the archeological record.
Between 1520 and 1685, various Europeans actually lived in the Caddoan area less
than 1.5 years in total, and it is virtually certain that most Caddoan peoples during this time
never saw a European (Perttula 1992:29). As a result, artifactual evidence of this phase of
European contact is minimal. As Krieger points out:

HJN 100074 EID

25

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

In any one site, something like twenty beads and two bits of iron may be all that can be
found to represent perhaps a century of contact; and this being true, there must be
scores of sites actually occupied during the same ‘historic period’ from which the
archaeologist cannot recover a single European object (in Davis 1961:120).

The second major phase of European contact in the Caddoan historic period began with
the renewed exploration of the Mississippi Valley following the establishment of the Illinois
colony by the French in the 1670s. The Mississippi River, initially explored by Marquette and
Joliet in 1673 to the mouth of the Arkansas River (Delangez 1946), was fully explored to its
mouth by La Salle. Three years later, another expedition directed by La Salle intended to
colonize the area and link the Gulf Coast with the growing French colonies of Illinois and
Canada. For unknown reasons, this expedition missed the mouth of the Mississippi River and
came ashore on the Texas Gulf Coast at Matagorda Bay (Cox 1922; Gilmore 1986). La Salle
made several trips from Fort St. Louis to explore the region and try to find the Mississippi River,
visiting the Hasinai (or Cenis, in the French transcription) in 1686 before turning back with
several horses purchased from the Hasinai. Another effort was made in 1687 by the survivors
of Fort St. Louis; however, La Salle was murdered by several of the men partway through this
trip, and the remaining party decided to stay on with the Hasinai.
The years between 1685 and 1714 were a time of continual French and Spanish
exploration of the Caddoan area. The threat of French settlement in an area the Spanish
considered to be officially under their hegemony spurred serious Spanish efforts to settle and
missionize the country east of New Mexico and the Rio Grande known to them as the “Kingdom
of the Tejas” (Bolton 1912; Perttula 1992:30). At the same time, the French were determined to
take advantage of the La Salle explorations to extend their claims in the region. Shortly
thereafter, English colonies were established along the South Atlantic Coast that wished to
extend trade routes west to Native American groups living on the Mississippi River and the
Texas Gulf Coast (Coker and Watson 1986; Crane 1929; Usner 1989). European political
relationships, trade and religious objectives, and the larger spheres of influence under the
control of the Spanish, French, and British in the developing world economy all played important
parts in the fate of the Caddo between ca. 1685 and 1800 (Braudel 1984:21-85, 387-429;
Wallerstein 1974; Wolf 1982:129-231). Trade contacts, rumors of settlement, and exploration
by one government were responded to in kind by others as part of the unstable process of
colonization.
The nature and character of sustained European contact has been
comprehensively discussed by many researchers (Bolton 1915, 1987; Cox 1909; Fieldhouse
1966; Galloway 1982; Gibson 1989; Giraud 1957, 1963, 1974a, 1974b; John 1975, 1985;
Surrey 1916; Swagerty 1984; Usner 1987; Wade 1989), and only the broad outlines are
presented below in the interest of summarizing the varying European objectives as they
impacted the Caddo.
From the 1790s, containment of the expanding US east of the Mississippi River
dominated Spain’s concerns in its Texas and Louisiana colonies, and the allegiance of the
various Indian nations of the Provincias Internas, such as the Caddo, Wichita, and Comanche,
was perceived by the Spanish government as a critical factor in controlling the frontier. The
1790s were a period of growth in the American fur trade, and another major growth period in the
industry occurred from 1800 to 1808 (Clayton 1967). Beaver was the primary fur resource in
26

100074 - arch survey report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of G-M WSC’s Proposed Surface Water Treatment Facility and
Intake Structure Project in Sabine County, Texas

the trade from 1790 to 1820. The Kadohadacho and Hasinai participated in the trade from the
outset, and their contributions to the fur trade were considered important parts of the Spanish
and Louisiana economies (Ewers 1969:47-48; Flores 1984; Peake 1954:17-18). Following the
purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, the US moved rapidly to explore the boundaries
and character of its new territory, and the federal government emphasized the establishment of
commercial and political relationships with resident aboriginal groups, including Caddoan tribes.
The Freeman and Custis expedition of 1806 on the Red River followed specific guidelines
regarding interaction with the Indians. This expedition was ultimately abandoned due to
interference with the Spanish related to questions about the boundary between Spanish Texas
and the Louisiana Territory. The US initiated a border war with Spain that resulted in the 1806
Neutral Ground Agreement. Possession of the Red River, as well as the territorial allegiance of
the Kadohadacho, remained unresolved (Flores 1984:287).
As Spanish and American trading ventures evolved through the first 2 decades of the
19th century, the actual settlement of the Red River, its tributaries, and the neutral ground
between Louisiana and Texas began in earnest (Strickland 1937; Haggard 1945). By 1818,
nearly 3,000 settlers from the Midwest and upper South had squatted illegally in Caddo country
along the south side of the Red River from the Great Bend to the Kiamichi River (Lottinville
1980:170-172). Anglo-American settlements increased up to and beyond the time of the Texas
Revolution in 1836 (Strickland 1937:64-238). This settlement expansion was also accompanied
by an influx of aboriginal groups from east of the Mississippi River and from the Arkansas River,
including Choctaw, Cherokee, Delaware, Kickapoo, Quapaw, Shawnee, and Koasati groups
(Anderson 1990; Everett 1990; Ewers 1969; Kniffen et al. 1987; Williams 1964). These groups
exchanged hides, corn, pumpkins, and beans at the trading house in Nacogdoches (Swanton
1942:88) as well as with American government traders at the new agency house at the mouth of
the Sulphur River. As the frontier moved west, Caddoan Indians in Louisiana became more
isolated in the Anglo-American community and were under continual pressure from these
settlers and from the immigrant Indians (Swanton 1942:88; Williams 1964). In Texas,
settlement pressures did not impinge on Caddoan lands until after 1830 (Strickland 1937:318355), though Stephen F. Austin viewed the aboriginal populations of Texas as a hindrance to
the security of settlement (Barker 1925).
Following the death of the Caddo chief Dehahuit in 1833, American pressure in
Louisiana on the new Caddo chiefs led to the ceding of Caddo homelands within the limits of the
US on 1 July 1835 (Swanton 1942:89-92). The Caddo relinquished their lands for $80,000,
agreed to move at their own expense within 1 year of the treaty date, and moved to Texas just
prior to the establishment of the Republic of Texas in 1836. The term Caddo Nation came to be
associated with the Cherokee as well as with the Hasinai, Anadarko, and other related tribes of
East Texas, and the Indians became subject to the repressive measures of successive Republic
of Texas administrations (Neighbours 1973, 1975). By the early 1840s, the Caddo Nation was
composed of remnants of the Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and other once-independent Caddoan
tribes, and it had been essentially pushed out of East Texas along with the other groups who
had signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Republic of Texas in 1843 (Strickland
1937:355; Swanton 1942:97). In 1846, the Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and Anadarko lived together
in a village of about 150 houses on the Brazos River near the present City of Waco, Texas;

shortly thereafter, they moved near the Clear Fork of the Brazos to maintain their distance from
Anglo-American frontier communities. From 1846 to 1854, the US government and the Texas
legislature founded the Texas Indian Reservation on the Brazos River (Neighbours 1957, 1973),
but this reservation lasted only until 1859 due to frictions among white settlers, Indian agents,
and the agglomeration of tribal members. Accordingly, in August 1859, the Caddo Nation, then
about 1,050 people in number, was removed to the Indian Territory and the Wichita agency in
western Oklahoma. Since that time, the history of the Caddo peoples is largely similar to the
overall history of the US.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted online via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
indicated the presence of 9 previously recorded archeological sites and 1 cemetery within a 1.0mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the APE (Figure 7). These sites/cemetery and their distances from
the proposed APE are summarized in Table 3 below. No previously recorded archeological
sites or cemeteries, including any listed on the NRHP or formally designated as SALs, are
located within or immediately adjacent to the APE.

Intake Structure Project in Sabine County, Texas

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the APE on 23 and 24 June 2010. This entailed intensive surface inspection as well as
subsurface shovel tests. The TSMASS require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre on
projects between 2 and 10 acres in size. As such, a minimum of 10 shovel tests were
necessary within the 5.0-acre water treatment facility tract. In addition, the TSMASS require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on linear projects. As the proposed water transmission line
ROW measures approximately 1.0 miles in length, a minimum of 16 shovel tests were
necessary along the proposed ROW. The location of the proposed intake structure on Lowes
Creek will measure less than 0.5 acres in size, thereby requiring a minimum of 2 shovel tests.
In all, a minimum of 28 shovel tests were necessary within the overall APE in order to comply
with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a total of
30 shovel tests within the APE. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.0millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate.
The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 8.
Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the APE resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were
observed on the surface of the APE or within any of the 30 excavated shovel tests.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the construction of G-M WSC’s surface water treatment facility, intake structure, and water
transmission line will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further
investigations are warranted for the project. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.
