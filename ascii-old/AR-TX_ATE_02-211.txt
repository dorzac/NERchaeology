Abstract
In August of 2017, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural resources
investigation in support of the Lower Colorado River Association’s (LCRA’s) T-513 Flatonia
to Waelder transmission line upgrade project in Gonzales and Fayette counties, Texas. The
transmission line rebuild will replace all 108 existing support structures along the 11.8-mile
long transmission line with new monopole structures. Previously, LCRA cultural resources
staff had identified approximately 5.5-miles of high probability area that contain 52 existing
support structures. Archaeologists surveyed a total of 5.6 miles within an 80–100-foot wide
corridor. In addition, AmaTerra identified 17 water crossings as additional high probability
areas. These high probability areas were assessed through pedestrian archaeological survey
and shovel testing. AmaTerra conducted the archaeological survey under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 8119.
Investigations consisted of a thorough pedestrian survey of each high probability area and
the manual excavation of 160 shovel tests throughout the proposed project area. Initially, 134
shovel tests were dug on high probability areas as a discovery tactic, and an additional 26 were
excavated during site delineation or in the assessment of isolated finds. AmaTerra documented
four newly discovered archaeological sites and one isolated find. A lack of intact features,
dateable materials, and/or stratified deposits, coupled with poor organic preservation, the
horizontal displacement of artifacts across sites, and adverse effects from modern disturbances
led investigators to conclude that all four sites have negligible research potential within the
surveyed right-of-way (ROW). The portions of these sites (41GZ253-256) that are contained
within the surveyed ROW are evaluated as ineligible for listing as State Antiquities Landmarks
and no additional work is recommended.
No artifacts were collected during the survey. All project-related records will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas-Austin.

Introduction
In August 2017, on behalf of the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA), AmaTerra
Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural resources survey and assessment in
advance of the LCRA’s proposed T-513 Flatonia to Waelder Transmission Line Upgrade in
Gonzales and Fayette counties, Texas (Figure 1). The transmission line rebuild will replace all
108 existing support structures along the 11.8-mile long transmission line with new monopole
structures within the existing 80–100-foot-wide easement. Total acreage surveyed within the
high probability areas was approximately 54 acres. The project will take place entirely within
existing right-of-way (ROW).
Previously, LCRA cultural resources staff had identified approximately 5.5-miles of high
probability area that contains 52 existing support structures. Additionally, AmaTerra identified
17 water crossings as additional high probability areas. These high probability areas were
assessed though pedestrian archaeological survey and shovel testing (Figure 2).
As a governmental jurisdiction of the State of Texas, LCRA is subject to the provisions of
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). LCRA authorized this program of cultural resource
investigations to ensure that significant cultural resources could be avoided during the
modernization of the T-513 transmission line and its associated components. AmaTerra’s
work conformed to the guidelines under 13 TAC Chapter 26, which outline the regulations for
implementing the ACT.
Field investigations took place in late July and early August of 2017, under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 8119. W. Nicholas Trierweiler served as the project’s Principal Investigator and
James J. Hill acted as the project archaeologist, while Amy Goldstein, Heath Bentley, and
Joshua Zatopek assisted with field investigations. Archeologists encountered no difficulties in
completing the investigations.
The survey recorded four new archaeological sites, designated 41GZ253, -254, -255, and
-256, and documented a single Isolated Find (IF). Two of the four sites are prehistoric, one is
historic, and one is multi-component. The prehistoric sites are both lithic scatters and/or small
intermittent campsites. The historic site appears to be a derelict pumping station related to an
abandoned pipeline and the multi-component site is an artifact scatter with both prehistoric
and historic artifacts. Due to a lack of intact features, diagnostic artifacts, dateable materials,
organic remains, and stratified deposits, coupled with the adverse impacts from modern
disturbances and the movement of artifacts across the surface, the four sites have little to no
research potential and are assessed as ineligible for listing as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SAL) with no additional work recommended within the existing LCRA easement.

Chapter 2

Environmental Setting
The portion of the LCRA transmission line that is included within the project area runs across
the cusp of two subregions of two separate ecoregions of Texas (Figure 3). Most of the project
area, including all four newly recorded archaeological sites, occurs within the Southern Post
Oak Savanna of the East Central Texas Plains ecoregion. The East Central Texas Plains region
is characterized by irregular post-oak plains with parallel ridges and valleys with variations
of sands and sandy loams and clayey soils between the uplands and lowlands (Griffith et al.
2007).
A short segment of the project area (approximately 1,600 feet) occurs in the Southern Blackland/
Fayette Prairie subregion of the Texas Blackland Prairies ecoregion of Texas. This section
begins east of Texas State Highway (SH) 95 and runs to an LCRA substation at the easternmost point of the project area. The Texas Blackland Prairie stands out from the surrounding
regions by its fine-textured, clayey soils and prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2007). The small
portion of the project area overlapped by this ecoregion was not included within the high
probability zone, and therefore no shovel tests were excavated within this area. However, the
transition between these two ecoregions was observed during investigations as archaeologists
approached SH95 from Fair Park Road to the west. This transition is marked by a decrease
in dissection from stream crossings and a shift to more fine-textured, very dark gray clayey
soils. Across the remaining portion of the project area, the vegetation, soils and physiography
resembles the Southern Post Oak Savanna as described by Griffith et al. (2007). The Paleoclimate for this region is poorly understood, but some data suggests that the current and historic
ecology and climate of the Post Oak Savanna has existed for at least the past three-thousand
years (Fields 2004).

2.1	Climate
The project area occurs within a moist, sub-humid environment (Blair 1950). On average, the
area receives 37.3 inches of precipitation annually and has air temperatures with an average
annual high of 80.2 and low of 57.3 degrees Fahrenheit (AgSite 2017).

2.2	Geology
The underlying bedrock geology of the Southern Post Oak Savanna subregion consists of
Oligocene, Eocene, and Paleocene sands, silts, and clays (Griffith et al. 2007). According to the
Geologic Atlas of Texas (2017), the project area is underlain by the Yegua (Ey), Cadell (Eca),
Manning (Em), Wellborn (Ewb), Whisett (E0w) and Catahoula (Mc) formations of Miocene,
Oligocene and Eocene in origin. Recent alluvium (Qal) is present in the west portion of the
project area around branches of Peach Creek (TWDB 2017). Soils across the East Central Texas

Plains ecoregion are commonly acidic and consist of sands and sandy loams in the uplands
and clay and clay loams in the lowlands with an underlying compact clay pan. Soils in the
Southern Post Oak Savanna consist of thermic and ustic Alfisols and Mollisols with Inceptisols
and Vertisols on floodplains (Griffith et al. 2007). Surficial soils across the Southern Post Oak
Savanna subregion consist of clay and sand residue of Quarternary to Tertiary deposits (Griffith
et al. 2007). According to the United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources
Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Web Soil Survey (2017), 17 named soil groups fall within
the proposed project area (Appendix A). Of these groups, the Arol, Crockett, Degola, Edge
and Granado series commonly occur around stream crossings and their associated landforms,
which gives the areas where they occur the highest potential for cultural resources. Many of
these soils are characterized by fine sandy loam overlying clay. Soil groups with clay and clay
loam textures at the surface are present in the lowlands and around drainages. In the eastern
extent of the project area clayey textures become more prominent (USDA-NRCS 2017).

2.3	Hydrology
Located within the Guadalupe River drainage basin, the area is characterized by rolling-tolevel irregular plains dissected by low to moderate gradient streams (Griffith et al. 2007). The
sandy alluvial soils of the rivers and streams throughout the ecoregion support the mesic forest
native to the region. This in turn supports the movement of many faunal species through the
area (Blair 1950; Griffith et al. 2007). The project area corridor bisects 17 drainages, which
includes perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams. Most of these streams feed into Peach
Creek, which flows into the Guadalupe River about 18 miles south of the western extent of the
project area.

2.4	Flora
Also called the Post Oak Savanna or the Claypan Area, the East Central Texas Plains was
historically comprised of post oak savanna. Recently, areas in the south have been encroached
upon by mesquite scrub vegetation (Figure 4). The Southern Post Oak Savanna subregion
includes more wooded forest than the adjacent Blackland Prairie due to the support from the
region’s sandy soils (Blair 1950; Griffith et al. 2007). This subregion is currently composed
of a combination of oak-hickory forest, oak savanna, pasture and rangeland (Figure 5). Some
thickets of mesquite, yaupon and eastern redcedar occur in the south (Griffith et al. 2007)
where the project area is located. Common vegetation across the Southern Post Oak Savanna
includes primarily blackjack oak, black hickory, and little bluestem, purpletop, curly threeawn,
and yellow Indiangrass grasses. Yaupon, eastern red cedar, winged elm, American beautyberry,
and farkleberry generally comprise the understory (Griffith et al. 2007).
Vegetation that occurs specifically within the project area includes grasses such as little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), beaked panicum (Panicum
anceps), yellow Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), fall
witchgrass (Digitaria cognata var. cognate), Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), sedge
(Carex), dropseed (Sporobolus compositus var. compositus), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa

live oak (Quercus virginiana), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), hackberry (Celtis), cedar elm (Ulmus
crassifolia), American elm (Ulmus americana), black willow (Salix nigra), and honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa) are common trees that occur alongside the portion of the transmission
corridor where this project area is located. Common understory species in the project area
include grape (Vitis), American beautyberry (Callicarpa Americana), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria),
awnless bushsunflower (Simsia calva) and sleepingplant (Chamaecrista fasciculate) among
other shrubs (USDA-NRCS 2017).
The only endangered plant listed for the project area includes the Navasota ladies’-tresses
orchid (Spiranthes parksii) (Griffith et al. 2007; U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 2017).

2.5	Fauna
The project area falls within the Texan Biotic Province of Texas as described by Blair (1950),
which was assigned to designate the broad ecoregion in between the forests of east Texas and
Oklahoma and the grasslands of the western parts of the states. Mammals that occur across
the Texan province include the white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), nine-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus) (Blair 1950; Griffith
et al. 2007), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), the swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus
aquaticus) and rodents such as the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus
niger), baird’s pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Geomys breviceps),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus),
ground squirrels (Marmotini spp.), hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse
(Peromyscus maniculatus), prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) and various species of birds,
snakes and turtle in riparian zones (Blair 1950). Historically, jaguar (Felis onca), ocelot (Felis
pardalis), red wolf (Canis rufus), gray wolf (Canis lupus), black bear (Ursus americanus) and
mountain lion (Puma concolor) were once common throughout the region.
The whooping crane (Grus americana) migrates to the region seasonally and is the only
endangered animal listed for the project area (U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 2017).

Regional Cultural Background
And Previous Investigations
The project area is situated in the borderlands of several archaeological regions as defined by
Perttula (2004) (Figure 6). It crosses both the South Texas and Savanna and Prairie regions
(Perttula 2004:7), though the southern Post Oak Savanna is archaeologically more closely
related to the Central and Southeast Texas archaeological regions (Fields 2004). Typically,
cultural chronology in Texas is divided into four major periods of time: Pre-Clovis and
Paleoindian (16,000–8800 years before the present [BP]), Archaic (8800–1200/1300 BP), Late
Prehistoric (1200/1300–250 BP), and Historic (350 BP–present) (Prewitt 1981). While the
Prehistoric Periods are principally defined by the presence of diagnostic projectile points and
other technologies, they are intended to order cultural change and are thus somewhat arbitrary;
cultural change proceeded at somewhat different rates over the vast area of Texas. A regional
chronology of the Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric and Historic periods are detailed in
the following sections.

3.1	Pre-Clovis and Paleoindian (ca. 16,000–8800 BP)
The arrival of humans in the New World may have occurred as early as 16,000 years ago with
Pre-Clovis peoples (Jennings and Waters 2014). Pre-Clovis occupation of Texas is evident
at the Debra L. Friedkin Site located along Buttermilk Creek in Bell County (Waters et al.
2011). Artifacts found at this site include bifaces, a discoidal core, edge-modified flake tools,
blade fragments, bladelets, a polished piece of hematite, and macrodebitage. Other sites in
Central Texas with probable Pre-Clovis components include the Gault Site, situated upstream
from the Debra L. Friedkin Site. Following Pre-Clovis is the Paleoindian Period, which dates
from 11,500–8800 BP and is often subdivided into the Early and Late Paleoindian subperiods
(Collins 2004).
The Paleoindian period was characterized by cooler and wetter climatic conditions than
today. Paleoindian peoples practiced unique subsistence patterns that consisted of hunting
now extinct megafauna and foraging from local plant resources (Black 1989; Mauldin et al.
2003). Early Paleoindian materials in the form of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile
points began to enter the archaeological record at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch. These
points were lanceolate-shaped and fluted for hafting to wooden spears. Using the launching
momentum from atlatls, large game such as mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse
were frequently taken (Black 1989). In addition to megafauna, Paleoindian groups also
subsisted on less daunting prey including antelope, water turtles, badger, and frogs, as well as
native plant resources (Waguespack and Surovell 2003). Stylistic changes in projectile point
technology occurred during the later portion of this subperiod, eventually shifting to the Late
Paleoindian subperiod defined by Clovis, Folsom, St. Mary’s Hall, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Angostura, and the Wilson type projectile points in South and Southeast Texas (Bousman et al.
2004; Hester 2004).

Chapter 3

Notable Paleoindian sites near the project area include the Wilson-Leonard, Gault, Pavo Real,
and Berger Bluff sites. In addition to these excavated sites, numerous instances of Paleoindian
projectile points have been documented in unstratified surface deposits throughout Central,
South, and Southeast Texas. Environmental studies suggest that Late Pleistocene Epoch
climates were wetter and cooler (Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al. 1993) during most
of the Paleoindian Period with a gradual shift to drier and warmer conditions at the onset of
the Early Holocene Epoch (Bousman 1998). As megafauna gradually died off, inhabitants
of Central and South Texas shifted their subsistence patterns towards smaller game and an
increased reliance on plant foraging. This cultural change is visible in the archaeological record
and marks the onset of the Archaic Period.

3.2

Archaic Period (ca. 8800–1200/1300 BP)

The Archaic Period, which lasted approximately 7500 years, is divided into the Early, Middle,
and Late Archaic subperiods (Collins 2004). This period signifies a shift away from megafauna
to smaller animals, a more intensive reliance on plant resources, an increased use in ground
stones for food processing, a decrease in residential mobility, the systematic burial of the dead,
the use of stone cooking technology, and an increase in woodworking tools (Yelacic and Lohse
2011).

3.2.1 Early Archaic
The Early Archaic subperiod (ca. 8800–6000 BP) is characterized by “very low population
density, small band sizes, highly mobile, and extremely large territorial ranges” (Black
1989:49). This behavior may be attributed to the arid environment (Hester 2004), as this
climate required inhabitants to be near water. For the South Texas archaeological region,
Thomas Hester (2004:136) divides the Early Archaic into two horizons: early corner-notched
and early basal notched. The early corner-notched horizon has corner-notched dart points with
recurved or notched bases. These point types include Martindale, Uvalde, Baker, Bandy, and
Gower dart points, and Guadalupe tools. The early basal-notched horizon is characterized by
dart points with deep basal notches, large bulbs, and distinctive long stems. Point types include
the Bell and Andice dart points. Additional tools associated with this horizon include early
triangular bifaces and large unifacial Clear Fork tools.
The Southeast Texas archaeological region shows a similar chronological change in stone tool
types. Story (1990) points out that there is a distinct sequence of dart point types in Southeast
Texas, which includes early side-notched and early stemmed forms and corner notched
Keithville, Neches River, and Trinity type points. This is followed by a transition to the Bell/
Calf Creek, Tortugas and Wells points later in the Early Archaic (Ricklis 2004).

3.2.2 Middle Archaic
Dating from about 6000–4000 BP, the Middle Archaic subperiod is marked by the onset of
the Altithermal, a long episode of warming and drying (Meltzer 1999). This subperiod is also

associated with a shift in subsistence to a greater reliance on plant resources (Black 1989; Hester
2004). In South Texas, tools associated with the Middle Archaic include Abasolo, Bulverde,
Lange, Morhiss, Pedernales, and Tortugas projectile points, unifacial distally beveled tools like
the Nueces tool, and marine shell ornaments and tools. Reliance on plant resources is evident
through “an increase in formal hearths, earth ovens, and burned rock accumulations” (Hester
2004:139), as well as the presence of ground stone tools, such as tubular stone pipes, grinding
slabs, and manos. Projectile point types associated with the Middle Archaic period in Southeast
Texas include Yarbrough, Bulverde and Travis with Pedernales points common in the western
portion of the region (Ricklis 2004).

3.2.3 Late Archaic
The Late Archaic subperiod dates from ca. 4000–1200/1300 BP. Kent and Gary make up the
dominant dart point types associated with the Late Archaic in Texas, with Ensor and Godley
types common in the far western portions of the Southeast archaeological region (Ricklis
2004). Late Archaic sites in Southeast Texas show a shift to the utilization of more local lithic
source material that is of poorer quality, which signifies a reduction in group mobility and
more spatially restricted territories (Story 1990). Another line of evidence showing reduction
in group mobility is the increase in cemeteries in South and Southeast Texas. One prominent
example is the Ernest Witte site in Austin County that contained over 200 individuals spanning
the Middle and Late Archaic. Burials that dated to the Late Archaic contained a wide variety of
grave goods that includes Ensor and Fairland dart points, corner-tanged knives, groundstone
“boatstones,” a gorget, bone pins, and conch shell beads and pendants. Large cemeteries with
grave goods become increasingly common in the Late Archaic, and the fact that the same types
of grave goods are found with both male and female burials suggests a somewhat egalitarian
social organization (Ricklis 2004).

3.3	Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1200/1300–250 BP)
The transition from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period in Texas is marked by the
advent of the bow and arrow, ceramics, and in some places, agriculture. Artifacts associated
with the Late Prehistoric period in the Central and South Texas regions consist of Scallorn,
Edwards, Perdiz, and Starr, and Zavala arrow points, as well as arrow shaft straighteners (Hester
2004). The Toyah Horizon, which dates from ca. AD 1300–1700, is a well-documented Late
Prehistoric cultural pattern that spans Central and South Texas. The Toyah Horizon is often
associated with bison hunting practices. Assemblages have Perdiz arrow points, end scrapers,
flake knives, beveled knives, bone-tempered pottery, perforators, shell ornaments, and bird
bone bead artifacts (Hester 2004).

3.4	Historic Period (250 BP–Present)
Europeans first entered what is now Texas in AD 1528 when members of the Panfìlo Narvàez
expedition washed ashore in Matagorda Bay. After this initial landing, the Spanish visited only
sporadically, and did not settle in Texas until around AD 1700 (Webb 1952). In response to the

continuous threat of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well as the French incursion into East
Texas, the Spanish erected a series of missions and presidios in Texas during the eighteenth
century. In 1820, the newly independent Mexican government began granting empresario
contracts to Anglo Americans to encourage settlement and development in Texas. It was these
land grants that brought the first permanent white settlers to what would become Gonzales and
Fayette Counties.

3.4.1 Gonzales County
The first Anglo-American settlers in Gonzales County came to Texas as part of Empresario
Green C. DeWitt’s land grant. DeWitt’s land grant was approved by the Mexican government
in April 1825, and that same year he appointed James Kerr to select and survey a town site.
Kerr chose a place at the confluence of the San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers, about one mile
east of the present-day location of the City of Gonzales. Within three years over 100 families
had settled in DeWitt’s colony (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016).
By 1831 Gonzales had a population of 532 but was still vulnerable to Indian attacks, which
prompted the Mexican government to send a six-pound cannon to the settlement for defense.
DeWitt’s Colony sent delegates to the Conventions of 1832 and 1833 and to the Consultation
of 1835. The Mexican government considered these to be acts of treason and thus sent troops
to retrieve the cannon in September of 1835. On October 2, colonists repelled the Mexican
troops’ efforts to take the cannon in what became known as the Battle of Gonzales. This was
the first armed conflict of the Texas Revolution (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016). A year
later Gonzales was once again at the center of the Revolution. The Runaway Scrape began
when Sam Houston arrived in Gonzales on March 11, 1836, and after learning of the fall of The
Alamo, ordered a retreat to the Colorado River. He also ordered all inhabitants to retreat with
him. It was not until Texan victory at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21 that settlers began
to return to their homes (Covington 2016).
Organized in 1837, Gonzales was one of the original counties of the Republic of Texas, with
its boundaries encompassing the entirety of DeWitt’s Colony. After Texas was annexed to
the United States in 1845, parts of the county were detached to form parts Caldwell, Comal,
DeWitt, Fayette, Guadalupe, Jackson, Lavaca, and Victoria Counties. Most early settlers set
up farms in the fertile Guadalupe and San Antonio River valleys. By 1840 cotton and corn
were the chief crops produced in the county, though cattle farming also became increasingly
important through the 1840s and 1850s. Many of these farms were fueled by slave labor; by
1850 slaves made up 40 percent of the county’s population (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016).
By 1860 Gonzales County had a total population of 8,059, of which 3,168 were slaves. On
February 23, 1861, citizens of Gonzales overwhelmingly voted for secession. Twenty-two
volunteer companies were formed from Gonzales County and joined the Confederate Army
(Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016). The population of Gonzales County increased after the
Civil War as settlers moved in from other southern states. From the 1870s through 1900 railroads
played an important part in the growth of the county. In 1874 the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San
Antonio Railway was built through the northern and eastern part of the county. A branch line

15

of this railroad was built into Gonzales in 1882. In 1877 the Texas and New Orleans Railway
built into the county as well. The new mobility offered by railroads led to a rise in population
and the number of operating farms in the county (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016).
Cotton and corn became important cash crops in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, with cotton reaching its peak production in 1920. Fluctuations in the prices of these
cash crops made farmers who relied too heavily on them susceptible to economic ruin, which
resulted in high levels of tenant farming in the county. At its height in 1930, tenant farmers
worked two-thirds of farms in the county (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016). After 1920
beef cattle farming once again became economically important for Gonzales County. Poultry
farming also became an important industry in the 1920s and 30s. Farming declined throughout
the second half of the twentieth century while the cattle and poultry industries grew. Today
Gonzales County is still largely rural and farming and ranching form the base of its economy.
As of 2014 the county had 20,462 people (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016).

3.4.2 Fayette County
Some of the first Europeans to pass through what is now Fayette County were Spanish
explorers in the early eighteenth century who travelled on La Bahìa Road, which ran northeast
to southwest through the area. The earliest known Anglo settlers in Fayette County were Aylett
C. Buckner and Peter Powell, who probably arrived in the area in 1821. They ran a trading
post on La Bahìa road west of present-day La Grange (Garrett 2016). The next year members
of Stephen F. Austin’s Old Three Hundred began to arrive in the area and Anglo-American
settlement began in earnest. In December of 1837, the Congress of the Republic of Texas
formed Fayette County, name for the Marquis de Lafayette. La Grange (named after Lafayette’s
chateau) was named its county seat.
People from Fayette County played an important role in the fight for Texas independence and
the Mexican invasions of 1842. Over 50 men from Fayette County fought in the Battle of San
Jacinto, including Joel W. Robison, one of Santa Anna’s captors (Garrett 2016). In September
1842 Captain Nicholas M. Dawson raised a company of 53 men from Fayette County to aid
Matthew Caldwell at the Battle of Salado Creek. On their way to Salado Creek, Dawson’s
company was intercepted by 500 Mexican Cavalry. The cavalry continued to fire on Dawson’s
company even after they had surrendered. Only nine men survived the incident that became
known as the Dawson Massacre (Cutrer 2010).
Most of the first settlers to Fayette County were from the southern United States, though a
few German immigrants came too. In the 1840s the number of German immigrants increased
significantly, and in the 1850s large numbers of Czech immigrants also began to arrive. After
the Civil War Fayette County saw a large influx of German, Czech, and Wendish immigrants.
By 1890 immigrants made up one fourth of the county population (Garrett 2016).
In the 1820s and 1830s settlers relied on subsistence farming, but during the late 1840s and
1850s the agricultural base switched to plantation farming of cash crops such as cotton, corn,
and tobacco. With this plantation economy cam increasing numbers of slaves. By 1859 the
16

Chapter 3

population of Fayette County was 11,604, of which 3,786 were slaves (Garrett 2016). Despite
the high proportion of slaves, voters of Fayette County narrowly rejected secession; this was
mostly because of the high population of Germans and Czechs who generally opposed slavery.
Regardless of this outcome, about 800 Fayette County men served in the Confederate Army
throughout the Civil War.
During the first few decades of the Twentieth Century cotton became the most important cash
crop, with more than half of all cropland devoted to cotton in 1929. Reliance on cotton led to
increased farm tenancy; in 1920, nearly half of all farmers were tenants (Garrett 2016). The
Great Depression, overproduction, droughts, and boll weevil infestations in the 1930s drastically
reduced the amount of cotton produced in the county. After WWII, the agricultural emphasis
shifted to cattle raising. Agriculture remains an important part of Fayette County’s economic
base today. In the 1980s and 1990s natural resources such as construction gravel, sand, and
oil and gas became economically important for the county. The all-time high population for
Fayette County was 36,542 in 1900 and gradually declined throughout the Twentieth Century.
As of 2014 the population was 24,833.

3.4.3 Waelder, Texas
The town of Waelder was surveyed in 1874 as one of many depots along the Galveston,
Harrisburg, and San Antonio Railroad. Many of the first residents of the town moved there
from Hopkinsville, which was five miles to the north (Baumgartner 2014). By the early 1880s
Waelder was a thriving railroad town with saloons, stables, a restaurant, a photograph gallery,
two steam mills, a brickyard, and schools. The town was incorporated in 1887 (Baumgartner
2014). The cattle industry and corn and cotton crops formed the basis of Waelder’s economy
in its early years, while the railroad provided easy transportation of these products to distant
markets. The railroad shipping depot continued to operate in Waelder until 1958. After WWII,
the population began to decline. The number of businesses also declined when Interstate 10
was built two miles south of town. The population in 1950 was 1,276; by 1990 it reached a low
of 745. As of the 2010 census the population was 1,065.

3.4.4 Flatonia, Texas
The original town of Flatonia was located one mile southeast of its current location. The
present-day location was established on April 8, 1874 on land purchased by the Galveston,
Harrisburg, and San Antonio Railway. People of the original Flatonia and the town Oso, three
miles northeast, moved their homes and businesses to the new location along the railroad
(Carroll 2010). The town was incorporated on November 10, 1875, and by 1878, had a
population of 800. The original settlers were mostly Anglo-American, though cheap land
and economic opportunity offered by the railroad soon brought German, Bohemian, Greek,
Arabian, and Italian immigrants to the town (Carroll 2010). In the 1880s a branch of the San
Antonio and Aransas Pass built a north-south running line through the town. In its early years
the agricultural economy of Flatonia depended equally on cotton and cattle, but by the 1960s
cotton production had nearly ceased as more and more land was converted to cattle ranches. In

the 1970s, I-10 was completed one mile north of the town, which drew some business away.
As of the 2010 census the population of Flatonia was 1,384.

3.5	Previous Cultural Resource Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) was consulted to identify previous surveys and
recorded cultural resources. Research focused on the identification of archaeological sites,
Registered Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed as SALs, sites listed on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), cemeteries, and archaeological surveys within
one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the project area. According to the Atlas only three previous surveys
overlap the project area, all of which are at or near the southern terminus of the project area. Of
the three surveys, two were completed more than 30 years ago and limited data was available
on the Atlas. Both were undertaken on behalf of the Rural Electrification Administration (REA)
in 1979 and 1981 respectively. A third survey was undertaken by Dan Prikryl and Charles
Hixson in 2011 on behalf of LCRA under Texas Antiquities Permit 5886. Although sites were
recorded during the survey, none were recorded in Fayette or Gonzales Counties (Prikryl and
Hixson 2011).
The Flatonia Commercial Historic District, two cemeteries and a single historical marker were
identified within the 1-km buffer of the project area but are well outside the immediate tower
locations and therefore will not be impacted by the T-513 re-design. Additionally, there are
no previously recorded archaeological sites within the existing T-513 transmission line or the
kilometer (0.62 mile) buffer.
Review of historic aerial photography and maps shows that historically the area has always
been rural. The primary built environment feature defining the project area is the GalvestonHarrisburg-San Antonio railroad paralleling the project area. Chartered in 1850, this was the
first railroad built in Texas, although the portion extending into the project area was not complete
until 1874 (Figure 7; see Figure 3-2). Also depicted, near Cedar Springs Creek is the small
community of Pierson. Subsequent maps and photographs analyzed after 1901 do not show
any signs of this rural community. Aerial photography from 1952 shows some development in
the area, with the presence of access roads and structures associated with nearby ranches and
farms as well as the railroad paralleling the project area (Figures 8–9). The presence of the
T-513 transmission line on the photographs indicates its construction is at least nearly seventy
years old and thus likely never surveyed. An examination of more recent USGS maps indicate
the railroad was re-named and later incorporated into the Southern Pacific Railroad as indicated
on a series of 1965 USGS 7.5 quadrangle maps (Figures 10–12). Recent aerial photographs do
not show a significant increase in development or housing construction around the project area.

Methods
Prior to field investigations, archaeologists conducted archival research to assess the potential
for historic-period archaeological materials. This research involved examining historical maps
and aerial photographs. In addition, archaeologists consulted the Atlas (2017) to assess the
potential for previously recorded archaeological sites within the project area, as well as a review
of literature on archaeological sites within the region (for example: Prikryl and Hixson 2011).
This allowed investigators to identify previously recorded archaeological sites adjacent to or
within the project area, and provided insight into site types, site settings, artifact assemblages,
and average depth of cultural materials below the ground surface. Lastly, the project area limits
were overlaid on aerial based gridded maps and loaded onto hand-held GPS units to aid in
navigation.
Field work was conducted from July 31-August 2, 2017. The archaeological survey conformed
to survey standards set forth by the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA). Approximately
5.5 miles of the transmission line were designated as having high potential for archaeological
deposits. LCRA and AmaTerra cultural resource staff previously identified 52 transmission
poles and 17 stream locations that pass through the project area, totaling 69 high probability
locations overall. An additional 0.1 miles was surveyed as in-field observations warranted
additional testing. Survey included visual inspection and shovel testing of each of the locations
identified within the high probability area. Additionally, archaeologists drove or walked along
nearly the entire length of the transmission line to give visual inspection to areas designated as
low probability.
In general, each high probability transmission pole location was visually inspected and subject
to two shovel tests within the proposed footprint of the replacement poles (Figure 13). In
some cases, fewer than two shovel tests were excavated if the location showed clear evidence
of ground disturbance. Occasionally more than two shovel tests were excavated at or near a
replacement pole location if the terrain looked particularly favorable for archaeological sites.
At stream crossings, at least one shovel test was excavated on each side of the stream. In
areas where streams paralleled the transmission line, one shovel test was excavated every
30-50 meters (Figure 14). Shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and extend to a maximum
depth of 80 cm below surface (cmbs). The shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments
and all soil was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests were backfilled upon
completion. Relevant information for all shovel tests was be recorded on a standardized form
and shovel test locations were marked with handheld GPS units.
For the purposes of this survey, an archaeological site was defined as containing a certain
number of cultural materials or features older than 50 years within a given area. The definition
of a site was: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 30-m radius, or (2) a single cultural
feature, such as a hearth or burned rock midden, observed on the surface or exposed during
shovel testing, or (3) a positive shovel test containing at least three total artifacts, or (4) two
positive tests located within an individual structure’s footprint.

All archaeological sites identified within the project area during the survey were investigated
by means of no fewer than six subsurface tests to define site boundaries within the LCRA
ROW. The exception was site 41GZ256; no shovel tests were excavated at this location because
the site consisted of a fenced-in abandoned pipeline substation. Specific site information was
recorded in the field through field notes, hand-drawn maps, digital photographs, and GPS
points. This information was later recorded on standardized forms and presented to TARL for
inclusion in their archives and assignment of new site trinomials. Any artifacts found either
on the surface or in shovel tests were catalogued and photographed in the field and returned to
their original locations. No artifacts were collected during the survey.

Results
A total of 5.6-miles (9.0-km) were surveyed as part of the T-513 Flatonia to Waelder
transmission line upgrade project. The survey was comprised of approximately 5.5 miles (8.8
km) of right-of-way (ROW) previously designated as high potential as well as an additional
0.1 miles (0.2 km) along the ROW assessed during field efforts has having additional high
potential for cultural resource occurrence. These areas are depicted in red in Figure 2. A total
of 160 shovel tests were excavated as part of the field efforts (Appendix B). A typical shovel
test measured approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and extended no deeper than 80
cm below surface (cmbs). Variability within shovel tests did exist and was depended largely on
localized field conditions including areas of disturbance, soil types, bedrock, etc. The shovel
tests were excavated in 10-cm increments and all soil was screened through a ¼-inch hardware
cloth. Relevant information for all shovel tests was recorded on a standardized form and will
be curated at TARL along with all other documentation associated with the project after the
final report is submitted to LCRA.
Field efforts identified four previously undocumented archaeological sites (Figure 15). For the
purposes of this survey, an archaeological site was defined as containing a specified number of
cultural materials or features older than 50 years within a given area. The definition of a site
was based on: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 30-m radius, or (2) a single cultural
feature, such as a hearth or burned rock midden, observed on the surface or exposed during
shovel testing, or (3) a positive shovel test containing at least three total artifacts, or (4) two
positive tests located within an individual structures footprint. Historical sites documented
were subject to archival research. This research included an attempt to determine history of
ownership and land use through deed research, and map research, wherever possible.
In general, sites identified within the project area had a minimum of six subsurface tests excavated
to define site boundaries relative to the study area (Figure 16). Specific site information was
recorded on standardized forms and has been submitted to TARL for inclusion in their archives
and to obtain new site trinomials. All artifacts were field catalogued and returned to their
original locations as per LCRA requirement that no artifacts were to be collected during the
survey. A discussion of each site is found below.

5.1	Site 41GZ253
Site 41GZ253 is a partially buried and primarily surficial prehistoric lithic scatter and
procurement site linked to the Early Archaic period. It is located across the eroded bank of
a stream terrace on the west edge of a low ephemeral drainage, about 1.07 miles west of
Baldridge creek (Figure 17). Consisting entirely of lithic artifacts, the site is located across
the surface of the eroded terrace slope where ground surface visibility is excellent (75–100
percent) (Figure 18). The right-of-way is dominated by Bermuda grass and flanked on both
sides by a moderately-dense forest of yaupon, post-oak and cedar trees. The site measures

0.18 acres within the ROW as defined by the horizontal extent of artifacts on the surface and
the location of one positive shovel test. No work was done outside the ROW. According to
the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2017), soils within the site area are affiliated with three
named soil groups. These consist of Crockett fine sandy loam with one to three percent slopes
and Edge fine sandy loam with three to eight and two to five percent slopes. Shovel tests placed
within the site area encountered yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and yellowish red (5YR 5/8) silt
loam that overlays clay at depths that range from 20 to 35 centimeters below surface (cmbs).
Site 41GZ253 was recognized with the discovery of scattered lithic artifacts across an
eroded terrace slope. Artifacts were observed scattered across the slope, while the majority
are concentrated along the west edge near the edge of the terrace. Subsequent testing of the
surface scatter involved the excavation of seven shovel tests around the site location. Of these
tests, only one shovel test (HB-04) led to the recovery of cultural material and consisted of
one small fragment of fire-cracked chert from 20–30 cmbs and less than five small flecks of
charcoal in the soil. Scattered artifacts observed along the surface included approximately
40–50 pieces of lithic debitage (consisting of primarily of cortical and tertiary flakes with
some angular debris), 15–20 fragments of fire-cracked chert, two quartzite hammerstones,
one informal unifacial scraper, and a triangular bifacial tool (Figure 19). The bifacial tool
features an abruptly truncated bit at the basal end that angles from the ventral to the dorsal
surface. Additionally, a dart point with multiple fractures was found along the terrace slope
(Figure 20). This point compares favorably to an Andice point, which is associated with the
Calf Creek Horizon in the Early Archaic period in Texas. Natural chert cobbles were observed
along the eroded face of the slope and represent a descriptively similar material to the lithic
debitage and tools at 41GZ253. This implies that the artifact assemblage represents material
knapped during the extraction of preferred lithic materials from this site. The observed lithic
material consists of jasper, yellow-brown and brown cherts. The dart point is composed of
mottled gray chert, which was not observed elsewhere at the site, and suggests an external
origin of its source material.

Figure 20. Andice-like projectile
point recorded at 41GZ253.

The cultural materials found on the surface are not in their primary context, as was confirmed
by lithic debitage observed eroding downslope away from the site area. Apart from the broken
Andice-like projectile point and the Clear Fork-like triangular biface, archaeologists did not
observe any features, diagnostic artifacts or otherwise dateable materials. The prehistoric
assemblage observed within the transmission line corridor is unexceptional to the region and
contains little potential additional data. Erosional disturbances along the cleared transmission
line ROW, have also likely contributed to the displacement of artifacts, and a rock two-track
road bisects the portion of the site located within the corridor. Shovel testing revealed very
little buried material and shallow soils (30 cmbs) at this site. Therefore, the portion of the site
within the ROW is believed to have little to no additional research potential beyond the data
that has been gathered during survey. No additional work within the ROW is suggested at this
time and 41GZ253 is not recommended eligible for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL).

5.2	Site 41GZ255
Site 41GZ254 is a completely buried and diffuse prehistoric lithic scatter situated on a low,
gently sloping terrace that overlooks a shallow ephemeral drainage approximately 0.25 miles
west of Baldridge Creek (Figure 21). Consisting entirely of lithic debitage, the site was located
through a series of shovel tests placed directly within the footprint of the current structure
where ground surface visibility was generally poor (0–25 percent). The ROW is dominated
by a combination of bermuda grass, broomweed, doveweed and mesquite and flanked on both
sides by a moderately-dense forest of live oak, cedar, and post-oak (Figure 22 5-8). The
site measures 0.25 acres within the ROW as defined by the location of six positive shovel
tests. No work was done outside the ROW. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey
(2017), soils within the site area are affiliated with one named soil group, consisting entirely
of Edge fine sandy loam with two to five percent slopes. Shovel tests placed within the site
area encountered brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy loam overlaying dense light red (2.5YR 6/8) and
reddish brown (5YR 5/3) basal clay at depths ranging from 20–40 centimeters below surface
(cmbs).

Positive shovel tests at 41GZ254 are located along both the east and west sides of the existing
transmission pole, and were delineated with negative shovel tests in both directions. In
addition, positive tests occur alongside the north and south corridor boundaries which suggests
that prehistoric materials associated with the site likely extend outside of the project area.
Although six positive shovel tests containing 11 lithic flakes were recorded within the site,
we did not observe any features, diagnostic artifacts, dateable materials, or organic remains.
The lack of these significant types of material and the inclusion of a small sample size of lithic
debitage limits potential research at this site to questions about small-scale lithic processing,
lithic procurement sources and regional hunter/gatherer mobility. Based on the results from
this survey, it is unlikely that 41GZ254 contains additional material within the project area that
can provide data that has the potential to supplement our understanding of prehistoric lifeways
beyond what can be gained from the analysis of presently recorded material. Therefore, the
portion of the site within the ROW is believed to have little to no additional potential for future
research. No additional work within the ROW is suggested and 41GZ254 is not recommended
eligible for listing as a SAL.

5.3	Site 41GZ255
Site 41GZ255 is situated in an open pasture near the bottom of a low rise that slopes north to
south approximately 0.15 miles southeast of the CR-415 and CR-455 interchange (Figure 23).
41GZ255 is a multicomponent site with prehistoric artifacts of unknown age and historic
artifacts dating to the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. A stock pond is located
directly south of the site. Ground surface visibility ranged from 25–90 percent throughout
and was higher on the two-track road that follows the ROW and on the exposed bank of the
stock pond (Figure 24). Ten shovel tests were excavated to determine the extent of subsurface
material associated with the site. However only one of these tests were positive. All tests were
placed within the ROW. Site boundaries were determined by the extent of artifacts on and
below the surface, within the ROW, and covers 0.72 acres. Current site boundaries are limited
to the LCRA ROW, but the site almost certainly extends beyond these, especially upslope to
the north. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2017), soils at 41GZ255 are of
the Arol series. This consists of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam with one to three
percent slopes. Very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay underlies this layer at depths of around 15
cmbs.
Nearly all the artifacts observed were on the surface. One shovel test, HB-21, contained one piece
of fire-cracked rock (FCR) five centimeters below the surface. Prehistoric artifacts observed on
the surface included: four bifaces, 20–30 lithic flakes (which includes primarily tertiary flakes),
10–15 pieces of chert FCR, two chert cores, and one sandstone metate (Figure 25). Chipped
stone artifacts are composed of brown and translucent gray cherts, chalcedony, and petrified
palm wood. Historic artifacts included: 5–10 shards of amethyst glass (including one bottle
neck), 5–10 shards of aqua glass, 5–10 shards of colorless glass, 3–5 shards of brown glass,
one shard of cobalt glass, 15–20 sherds of whiteware (including one decorated rim), 5–10
sherds of stoneware, 3–5 sherds of unglazed coarse earthenware, one wrought iron bolt, one
metal railroad spike, and one handmade horseshoe.

One historic feature was also observed on 41GZ255 several meters north of the LCRA ROW.
This feature consisted of a poured concrete slab that measured approximately 12 x 8 cm and
had “181P” etched into it (Figure 26–27). The concrete slab was surrounded on three sides by
boulders that had clearly been intentionally placed around it (Figure 28). Two other boulders
lined up with the concrete heading southwest approximately two meters apart. The purpose of
this feature is unknown; it may be some type of survey marker, although it does not align with
any current or known historic property boundaries.

A structure is plotted at the
site location on topographic
maps dated 1898, 1901, and
1922. The next available
topographic map, which
dates to 1965, does not show
a structure in this location.
Solarized amethyst glass
found at the site confirms
historic occupation during the
late nineteenth and/or early
twentieth centuries. Gonzales
County deed records show
that LCRA acquired the
easement
through
this
property from J. F. Robinson
in 1941 and at the time it did
not constitute any part of a
homestead (GCDR 197/243).
D.D. McCrory purchased
629.5 acres that included the
site in 1925 from the estate
of B. P. Bludworth. The 1930
U.S. Census indicates that
McCrory and his family may
have been living somewhere
on the property at that time.
Figure 28. Drawing of rock feature at 41GZ255.
B. P. Bludworth acquired the
629.5 acres through three
separate purchases between 1893 and 1918. However, U.S. Census records from 1900–1920
indicate that the Bludworth family resided in Flatonia throughout this time. It is impossible
to tell which of the three properties purchased by Bludworth had the structure since the
surrounding area has changed dramatically from the metes and bounds descriptions, though at
least one of the tracts was owned by a cattle company.
Apart from the stone marker feature located just outside the ROW and the FCR recovered from
HB-21, no additional features, dateable organic materials, or buried cultural deposits were
observed during the site investigation. Artifacts associated with the historic component of the
site were found in combination with prehistoric artifacts near the stock pond and two-track
associated with the ROW corridor. This suggests the site consists largely of a deflated surface
assemblage likely redistributed from its primary context through an array of disturbances
including dispersal by livestock and machinery associated with the LCRA ROW and ranch
pasture. As a result, the portion of the site within the ROW has limited data potential and
is recommended not eligible for listing as a SAL. No additional work within the ROW is
warranted at site 41GZ255.

5.4	Site 41GZ256
Site 41GZ256 is a surficial historic-age site that consists of a derelict fenced yard with equipment
located on the edge of the ROW, on a stream terrace about 318 feet west of its intersection
at CR 427 (Figure 29). Vegetation within the corridor consists of a treeless landscape with
Bermuda grass and various weeds with sparse groundcover. The site area outside of the
corridor is populated largely by live oak and mesquite trees. According to the USDA-NRCS
Web Soil Survey (2017), soils at the site area consist of Tabor fine sandy loam with zero to one
percent slopes. Soils in this group typically consist of pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam
that overlies brown (10YR 5/3) clay at approximate depths of around 36 cmbs (USDA-NRCS
2017).
During inspection of the site area, archaeologists observed a combination chain-linked fence
with barbed-wire surrounding a facility with various oxidized equipment inside (Figure 30).
Approximately 0.02 acres of this fenced-in area overlaps the project corridor, while the entire
fence facility measures about 0.34 acres. A large concrete pad is present directly south of this
facility. Slightly east along the corridor a large rectangular concrete block with eight embedded
railroad rails was observed (Figure 31). Structures that are thought to be associated with the
facility appear on a 1965 topographic map. This coincides with the oxidized nature of the
equipment and overgrown vegetation within as the site does not appear to have been in use for
some time (Figure 32).
Deed research from the Gonzales County deed records indicates this facility is located on a tenacre plot that is currently owned by Teppco Crude Pipeline LP. The remains within this facility
are likely associated with a pipeline company (possibly the same one that currently owns it)
based on the presence of oil and gas pipe and a meter inside the facility. No shovel tests were
placed around the site area due to the relatively young-age of the facility, the surficial nature of
its remains, and the surrounding shallow soils. Archaeologists concluded that there was very
little potential for buried remains associated with this facility. Based on the limited amount
of the facility that is present within the corridor, it does not appear it will be impacted by the
replacement of current transmission poles. As a result, site 41GZ256 has limited data potential
and thus will not contribute research on the history of Gonzales County and is recommended
not eligible for listing as a SAL.

5.5

Isolated Finds

Archeologists documented a single Isolated Find (IF) during the archaeological survey. The
isolated find consisted of a single positive shovel test small containing a single chert flake 20
cmbs. The IF was observed solely on within the shovel test and shovel tests excavated adjacent
to the IF revealed no buried deposits.

Summary and Management
Recommendations
AmaTerra surveyed and tested 69 locations within the high probability areas totaling
approximately 5.6 miles in length for the proposed T-513 Flatonia to Waelder Transmission
Line Upgrade Project in Gonzales, and Fayette Counties, Texas. The survey included 5.5 miles
of high probability areas containing 52 locations of existing support structures previously
identified by LCRA cultural resource personnel, 17 water crossings identified by AmaTerra
staff and an additional 0.1 miles assessed during field efforts has having additional high
potential for cultural resources. Access was available to the entire proposed project area and
archaeologists did not encounter any conditions that inhibited the survey. AmaTerra conducted
the archaeological survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8119 and work conformed to the
guidelines for implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26.
During the survey, archaeologists excavated 160 shovel tests including 134 tests as a discovery
tactic on survey and an additional 26 tests to delineate sites. Within the previously existing
ROW, archaeologists recorded four newly discovered sites and a single IF. Within the sites
and the IF, archaeologists excavated 26 shovel tests of which only eight contained subsurface
materials. Average depth of soil on sites was merely 25 centimeters above basal clay.
The sites include two that date to the prehistoric period, one historic site, and one multicomponent site. The historic site (41GZ256) appears to a derelict pumping station related to an
abandoned pipeline. The multi-component site (41GZ255) contains a scatter of glass, ceramic
and ferrous historic artifacts inundated with a scatter of prehistoric lithics. The prehistoric
sites (41GZ253 and 41GZ254) are lithic scatters and/or small intermittent campsites consisting
of low density surface scatters of lithic debitage with occasional bifaces and lithic tools.
Temporally diagnostic items observed included an Andice-like projectile point and a Clear
Fork-like triangular biface. No features were observed on any of the prehistoric sites.
All sites were evaluated using criteria outlined under 13 TAC 26. All three prehistoric sites
(including one multi-component site) have extremely shallow soils with negligible potential
to contain intact buried deposits. These sites are all characterized by a lack of features and a
lack of dateable materials, and by the presumed horizontal displacement of artifacts across the
surface. Within the existing ROW, none of the sites have any potential to contain significant
information pertaining to the prehistoric period of Central Texas. The one historic site lacks
integrity and none of the features have uniqueness or architectural merit. The multi-component
site (41GZ255) had a single historic feature associated several meters north of the LCRA
ROW. This feature consisted of a small, poured concrete slab with “181P” etched into it.
Should construction of any kind take place outside of the ROW in this area, this suspected
survey marker feature should be avoided. The portions of the four sites within the ROW (two
prehistoric, one multi-component and one historic) are recommended ineligible for listing as
SAL and on the NRHP and no additional work is recommended within the existing right-of-way.
