ABSTRACT

The project consists of reconnaissance, pedestrian, and cut bank survey of existing and new rightof-way along FM 455 between US 75 and SH 121 in Collin County, Texas. The project area is
6.4-miles long and the right-of-way varies in width between 70 and 118 feet on either side of FM
455. A total of 65.85 acres is state owned property, with 10.17 acres of proposed right-of-way
currently on private property. The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this project
area is to determine the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate identified
resources for their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places as per
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as
a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas. This work is being
conducted under the Civil Associates, Dallas Evergreen contract in which Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI
project number 30561.00.01) is a subcontractor. Fieldwork for the pedestrian survey was
undertaken in November 2006, by Geo-Marine, Inc.
Large portions of the proposed project area were heavily disturbed by previous road construction,
utility and pipeline placement dumping, erosion and erosion control measures. No significant
cultural deposits were identified during the current survey. As a result of these investigations, it
is recommended that the proposed widening and alterations of FM 455 will have no effect on
archeological historic properties and that no further work is required. Notes, forms, files,
photographs, and other materials from this project will be permanently housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

INTRODUCTION

The project consists of reconnaissance, pedestrian, and cut bank survey of existing and new rightof-way (ROW) along FM 455 between US 75 and SH 121 in Collin County, Texas. The Area of
Potential Effects (APE) is 6.4-miles long and the ROW varies in width between 70 and 118 feet
on either side of FM 455 and falls completely in an upland environment. A total of 65.85 acres is
state-owned property, with 10.17 acres of proposed ROW currently on private property. The
purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this project area is to determine the
presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for their
eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places as per Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas. This work is being conducted
under the Civil Associates, Dallas Evergreen contract in which Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), is a
subcontractor. Fieldwork for the pedestrian survey was undertaken in November 2006, by GMI.
The pedestrian survey fieldwork was undertaken in November 2006 by Kristen J. Bastis and
Samuel C. Barrick (archeologists) of GMI. Melissa M. Green, also of GMI, served as Principal
Investigator for the project.
The APE extends along FM 455 between US 75 and SH 121 (Figures 1 and 2). The APE varies
between 70 and 118 ft in width on either side of FM 455 and consists of existing ROW and
proposed ROW. Along with widening the highway, the project includes straightening a curve at
Throckmorton Creek and making a more gradual curve north of the intersection of FM 455 and
SH 121 at the east end of the APE.
The entire APE is in an upland environment with nine small intermittent drainages crossing the
APE flowing into Sister Grove Creek and into Lake Lavon. Large portions of the APE were
heavily disturbed by previous road construction, utility lines, pipelines, erosion, and erosion
control measures along FM 455.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Collin County is within the Texan biotic province defined by Blair (1950) as an intermediate zone
between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the grasslands of the
Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits of their range in
the Texan province. The vegetation within the project area is predominantly grassland with
scattered clusters of trees, with the greatest concentration of trees being found along the
drainages. Grasses expected to occur within this area include: little bluestem, big bluestem,
Indiangrass, hairgrama switchgrass, Florida paspalum, eastern gramagrass, sideoats grama, Texas
needlegrass, Virginia wildrye, Torrey silver bluestem, meadow dropseed, vine-mesquite, and
buffalograss (Coffee et al. 1980:88-90). The faunal community in this region has undergone
changes due to the expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. However, the species of
wildlife, which previously inhabited the area, include bobwhite, quail, pheasant, meadowlark,
field sparrow, sage grouse, lark bunting, cottontail, red fox, antelope, and deer (Coffee et al.
1980:50).
The region has a warm, temperate, humid subtropical climate that is generally mild, with periods
of extremely hot and cold weather being limited in duration. Yearly rainfall is fairly evenly
distributed, with the maximum rainfall occurring in April and May and the minimum in August.
Much of the rainfall occurs in heavy thunderstorms, with the rapid runoff allowing only limited
absorption of water by the soil. Snowfall is rare, with an average of less than 2.5 cm (1 in) falling
per year. The snowfall is generally present for less than one week. The prevailing winds are
southerly. Temperatures remain above 32Â° F approximately 240 days each year (Orton 1969).
The proposed project area along FM 455 is underlain by the Cretaceous-age Austin Chalk
Formation. The Austin Chalk Formation can be divided into 3 parts; the upper and lower parts
are light gray, massive, with some interbedding and partings of calcareous clay. The middle part
is mostly thin bedded marl with interbeds of massive chalk of light gray that weathers white.
Marine mega-fossils are scarce throughout. Austin Chalk can be divided eastward into six units;
Roxon Limestone, Goober Chalk, Brownstone Marl, Blossom Sand, Bonham Marl, and Ector
Chalk. The thickness of undivided Austin Chalk is 600 feet. (Bureau of Economic Geology
1991).

The proposed project area consists of 14 soil map units: Altoga silty clay 5 to 8 percent slopes,
eroded; Austin silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Austin silty clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes, eroded;
Burleson clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes; Burleson clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Eddy gravelly clay
loam, 3 to 8 percent slopes, eroded; Houston Black clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes; Houston Black
clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Houston Black clay 2 to 4 percent slopes, eroded; Hunt Clay 1 to 3
percent slopes; Lewisville silty clay 1 to 3 percent slopes ; Lewisville silty clay 3 to 5 percent
slopes, eroded; Stephen silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; and Stephen-Eddy complex, 3 to 5
percent slopes, eroded. The soils are all upland and eroded uplands (Hanson and Wheeler 1969).
The Altoga Series is composed of deep calcareous light colored clayey soils. They occur on
uplands and stream terraces mostly in the eastern part of the county. The typical profile recorded
for this series begins with a light brownish gray light silty clay about 17 cm (7 in) thick. This is
underlain by a B2 horizon of pale brown light silty clay about 46 cm (18 in) thick. The B3ca
horizon is very pale brown silty clay about 88 cm (35 in) thick. The C horizon is very pale brown
silty clay with few mottles of yellowish brown and grayish brown silty clay beginning at 150 cm
(60 in) (Hanson and Wheeler 1969:18-20).
The Austin series is composed of deep, clayey, upland soils that form above clayey marl or
chalky limestone. The representative profile recorded for this series begins with a dark grayish
brown silty clay about 40 cm (16 in) thick. This is underlain by the B horizon, beginning with a
light brownish gray silty clay from 40 to 61 cm (16-24 in) below surface and a pale brown silty
clay from 61 to 76 cm (24-30 in) below surface. The C horizon consists of a very pale brown
silty clay from 76 to 107 cm (40-42 in) below surface and is underlain by the parent material.
The profile for the Austin silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is very similar to the representative
profile except that the A horizon is about 46 cm (18 in) thick. The Austin silty clay, 3 to 8
percent slopes, eroded, is described by the representative profile. In some areas of the map unit
small gullies have formed. Austin silty clay, 5 to 8 percent slopes, eroded, is similar to the
representative profile except that the A horizon is only 30 cm thick. Portions of the map unit
contain rills and small gullies, while subsoil is occasionally found at the surface (Hanson and
Wheeler 1969:9-10).
Burleson series soils are deep, nearly level to moderately sloping clays found on uplands and on
old alluvial terraces. The representative profile for the series was dug in Burleson clay, 0 to 1
percent slopes. This profile begins with a dark gray clay A horizon about 84 cm (33 in) thick that
is underlain by a gray clay AC horizon extending from 84 to 137 cm (33-54 in) below surface.
The light olive brown clay C horizon is found from 137 to 191 cm (54-75 in) below surface.
Burleson clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, has a soil profile very similar to the representative profile.
The A horizon for the Burleson clay, 2 to 4 percent slopes, eroded, is cut by many rills and broad,
shallow gullies. Erosion has removed some of the A horizon, which is only about 61 cm thick.
Light brown clay was encountered at 102 cm (40 in) below surface (Hanson and Wheeler
1969:10-11).
Eddy series soils are very shallow, loamy, upland soils that formed on chalky limestone. The
typical soil profile described for this series represents the Eddy gravelly clay loam, 1 to 3 percent
slopes. It begins with a grayish brown, gravely clay loam A horizon about 13 cm (5 in) thick that
contains large quantities of chalk fragments. This is then underlain by the white chalk bedrock,
which in the upper part (between 13 and 25 cm [5-10 in] below surface) contains grayish brown
clay loam in cracks. Eddy gravelly clay loam, 3 to 8 percent slopes, eroded, is similar except for
a thinner (10 cm [4 in]) A horizon (Hanson and Wheeler 1969:12-13).
7

Houston Black series soils are deep, calcareous soils found on nearly level to moderately sloping
uplands or old alluvial terraces. The Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is about 178 cm
(70 in) thick. It has a very dark gray clay A horizon about 112 cm (44 in) thick, with the upper 15
cm (6 in) being a plow zone. Below this is the AC horizon, consisting of a light gray clay 112152 cm (44-60 in) deep. Finally, there is a light gray clay C horizon from 152 to over 178 cm
(60-70+ in) deep. The Houston Black clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, has a similar but thicker profile,
with the A horizon being 140 cm (55 in) thick and the AC horizon 76 cm (30 in) thick. In
contrast, the Houston Black clay, 2 to 4 percent slopes, eroded, has a thinner solum, with an A
horizon only 81 cm (32 in) thick and an AC horizon only 40 cm (16 in) thick (Hanson and
Wheeler 1969:18-20).
The Hunt series are deep, nearly level to gently sloping clayey upland soils with free lime below
50 cm (20 in). The Hunt clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is about 130 cm (52 in) thick. It has a very
dark gray clay Ap horizon about 15 cm (6 in) thick. Below this is an A11 horizon of very dark
gray clay 36 cm (14 in) thick, a A12 horizon of very dark gray clay, 40 cm (16 in) thick, and a
AC horizon of gray clay 25 cm (10 in) thick. Below this is the C horizon of mottled gray and
light gray clay with few distinct mottles of brownish yellow clay, at least 40 cm (16 in) thick
(Hanson and Wheeler 1969:18-20).
The Lewisville series consists of deep, calcareous, clayey soils that are found on gently to
moderately sloping uplands. These soils formed in alluvium deposited by streams that drain soils
underlain by chalky limestone. A representative profile consists of a dark grayish brown light
silty clay Ap horizon 15 cm (6 in) thick, and a A1 horizon of dark grayish brown light silty clay
25 cm (10 in) thick. Below this is a B horizon of grayish brown silty clay with many cemented
concretions of calcium carbonate 46 cm (18 in) thick and a Cca horizon of pale brown silty clay
with numerous soft masses of segregated calcium carbonate at least 50 cm (20 in) thick (Hanson
and Wheeler 1969:18-20).
The Stephens series consists of shallow, clayey upland soils that formed above chalky limestone.
The representative profile for the series describes Stephen silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes. It
begins with a dark grayish brown silty clay A horizon 36 cm (14 in) thick that is underlain from
46 to 51 cm by a combined A&R horizon that is primarily chalky limestone fragments with small
quantities of brown silty clay in between fragments. Beneath this is the chalky limestone R
horizon. Stephen-Eddy complex, 3 to 5 percent slopes, eroded is found on ridge tops and along
the slopes above natural drainages. The complex is composed of approximately 70 percent
Stephen soil, 25 percent Eddy soil, and 5 percent Austin soil. The profile for the Stephen soils
are similar to that described as typical for the series, but the A horizon is only 30 cm (12 in) thick.
The Eddy soils have a grayish brown gravelly clay loam about 10 cm (4 in) thick, that is
underlain chalky limestone with clay loam soil in cracks from 10-20 cm (4-8 in) below surface.
Austin chalk bedrock begins beneath this (Hanson and Wheeler 1969:24-25).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Three major reports concerning the archeology of the Upper Trinity River Basin (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986) aptly summarize the history of
archeological investigations within the Upper Trinity River drainage and the culture-historical
framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archeologists have resulted in the recording of numerous sites, it is apparent that much research
remains to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988), much of the excavation efforts within the
Upper Trinity River Basin has focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm Fork
(Brown and Lebo 1991; Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Lebo 1995a, 1995b; Lebo and
Brown 1990; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner et al. 1982) and the East Fork (Dawson and
Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Field school excavations
by the University of Texas at Arlington at the Northlake site on Grapevine Creek were also
reported in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975). Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney et al. 1988;
Peter and McGregor 1988) and the test excavations of the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al.
1987), have provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding of the
adaptations along the West Fork of the Trinity River.
Reservoir studies along the East Fork have included work at Lake Lavon and Lake Ray Hubbard.
Lake Lavon was surveyed in 1949 with test excavations being conducted at the Campbell Hole
(41COL10) and Hogge Bridge (41COL1) sites (Stephenson 1949). Additional excavations
conducted at the Hogge Bridge site resulted in the formal definition of the Wylie focus a Late
Prehistoric manifestation believed to be characterized by arrow points, flexed burials, large pits
(often), and trade pottery from cultures to both the east and west (Stephenson 1952). In 1964, the
Texas Archeological Salvage Project conducted an inventory survey of a planned enlargement of
Lake Lavon (Lorrain 1965). Later, excavations were carried out by Southern Methodist
University (SMU) at selected sites found during the survey (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott
1975). Lake Ray Hubbard was surveyed with the help of Dallas Archeological Society (DAS)
members in 1963 (Harris and Suhm 1963); excavations were carried out subsequently at the Glen
Hill (41RW4) and Upper Rockwall (41RW2) sites (Ross 1966), and the Lower Rockwall site
(41RW1) (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968). Much of this work was concentrated on excavations at
âWylie focus pitâ sites in an effort to better understand the function of these large depressions.

The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) has sponsored many projects within Collin
County. In 1990, GMI undertook a pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching at Lake Lavon
along the western perimeter of the federal property. The project resulted in the recording of one
prehistoric site (Peter et al. 1990). In 1991, another survey along the eastern edge of Lake Lavon
also resulted in the recording of one prehistoric site (Hunt et al. 1991). Another survey
undertaken on the southern edge of Lake Lavon during 1993 did not locate any cultural properties
(Hunt 1993). In 1992, a geoarcheological investigation was conducted for the NTMWD at the
City of McKinney landfill (Hunt et al. 1992). No cultural properties were identified. During
1993-1995, GMI conducted a reconnaissance, intensive pedestrian survey, and geoarcheological
investigation for the NTMWDâs Cooper Water Transmission Line (Hunt et al. 1995). Four sites
were found during this project, three of which were considered ineligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or nomination as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL), while the fourth is considered of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or
nomination as a SAL. During 1996, GMI conducted a survey for an 8.1 km pipeline along the
western edge of Lake Lavon (Hunt and Peter 1996a). No cultural properties were discovered.
During 1998, GMI undertook a survey for the Princeton Lift along the northwest edge of Lake
Lavon (Hunt et al. 1998). Four historic sites were discovered during the project, but all were
determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or nomination as a SAL. During 1999, a
survey was conducted for a 23-acre expansion at the Wilson Creek Water Treatment Plant near
Lucas, Texas (Clow 2000). No cultural properties were discovered.
Many other small projects have been undertaken in Collin County. In 1974, a survey of the Soil
Conservation Serviceâs Clemons Creek Watershed was undertaken by SMU (Hughston and
Lynott 1974). Investigations initiated by the Texas Water Development Board were completed
for the cities of Renner (Whitsett 1977) and McKinney (Fox 1979) in the late 1970s. A survey of
a pipeline proposed to cross the northern section of Collin County by Matador Pipelines, Inc., was
completed in 1981 (Peter 1981). In 1984, a survey was sponsored by the Farmers Electric
Cooperative (Skinner 1984). During 1985, ARC conducted a cultural resources survey of the
Maxwell Creek landfill site (Skinner 1985). No sites were discovered. In 1990, ARC conducted
at survey of the Wilson Creek Park IV in the City of McKinney (Skinner 1990). A survey of the
Spring Creek Nature Area was undertaken for the City of Richardson by AR Consultants, Inc.
(ARC) in 1991. An Archaic site and a historic cemetery were discovered. The City of McKinney
Stonebridge Park was surveyed by ARC in 1992. No cultural resources were discovered (Skinner
1992). During 1994, the City of Plano sponsored a cultural resources survey of the Plano
Municipal Golf Course (Skinner and Whorton 1994), while Ferring did a survey of two water
pipelines for the Danville Water Supply Corporation (Ferring 1994). One prehistoric site was
found by Ferring. Also during 1994, GMI conducted a pedestrian survey of proposed Dallas
Area Rapid Transit (DART) light rail lines in Dallas and Collin counties (Green et al. 1997). One
historic site, the Jacob Routh homestead and cemetery (41COL83) was found in Collin County.
In 1995, GMI undertook a survey of 280 acres at Lake Lavon as part of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Recreation Partnership Initiative (Hunt and Peter 1996b). Four non-site localities were
discovered at Lake Lavon. In 1996, ARC conducted a cultural resources survey for the Dallas
North Tollway Extension (Skinner 1996). No cultural resources were discovered. Also during
1996, ARC conducted cultural resources evaluation of two sites, 41COL79 and Graves Farm
(41COL78), at Stonebridge Ranch west of McKinney (Skinner and Trask 1996; Skinner and
Whorton 1996). Both sites were determined to be ineligible for inclusion to the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP). ARC also conducted a survey of the Allen Station Park Site (Skinner
and Skinner 1996). Three historic sites were discovered, but no further work was recommended.
During 1997, the Texas Water Development Board undertook the survey of a proposed sewer line
along Tickey Creek, south of Princeton (Davis 1997). A pedestrian survey of the 2.74-km
10

pipeline was conducted in addition to the excavation of 14 backhoe trenches as part of a
geoarcheological investigation in the Tickey Creek flood plain. No cultural resources were
discovered during the investigation. Also during 1997, ARC conducted an archeological survey
of the 50-acre Hedgecoxe Road Athletic Site for the City of Plano (Skinner 1997). No cultural
properties were discovered. During 1998, ARC did an inventory survey of the 18-acre Eldorado
Heights Park in the City of McKinney (Kent et al. 1998), which did not find any cultural
properties. In 1999, GMI conducted an intensive pedestrian survey and geoarcheological
investigation for the 55-km Lake Chapman Pipeline in Collin and Denton counties (Owens and
Gibson 2000). Three historic sites were discovered, but these sites were considered ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or nomination as a SAL. In 2005 PBS&J recorded two buried prehistoric
sites, 41COL172 and 41COL173, along FM 1378 and FM 981 respectively during a TxDOT
survey (Sills et. al. 2005a and 2005b). GMI has relocated and is currently testing the buried
prehistoric sites 41COL172 and 41COL173 for the TxDOT road widening and bridge
rehabilitation of FM 1378 and FM 981 projects.
One previously recorded site was mapped within a 1-mile radius of the project area. Site
41COL143, a historic farm, was reported by PBS&J as part of the survey for a Texas Utilities
Electric Transmission Survey in 2001. The site was located in a pasture 0.6 km north of SH 121
and 4.7 km east of US 5, east of an unnamed lake. The site was a 40-x-46 meter surface scatter of
window glass, whiteware, crockery, and metal. An oblong depression with a set of posts in a
square pattern was also noted. Four shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 60 cmbs but no
sub-surface artifacts were observed.

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
Although the chronological framework for the Upper Trinity River Basin is not well developed,
the available data allow the delineation of a generalized chronology (Table 1). Investigations at
Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have provided evidence for a refinement of the
chronology for the Late Prehistoric period, but the overall regional applicability of the phases
recognized at Joe Pool Lake remains to be demonstrated. Prikryl (1987) has presented a
chronological sequence of six periods. Unfortunately, his sequence relies almost totally on
diagnostic artifacts from surface contexts and comparisons to dated contexts distant from the
Upper Trinity River Basin. The generalized chronology presented here reflects the present state
of knowledge as interpreted from the Joe Pool Lake investigations. A brief summary of the
adaptations associated with these periods is presented below.

The Paleo-Indian occupation of the Upper Trinity River Basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts. The
Field Ranch site (Jensen 1968) along the upper Elm Fork is a primary example of typical site
contexts. Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks
in the Cross Timbers. The Lewisville Lake site (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961) is the best
known Paleo-Indian site within the region. While the original radiocarbon dates (ca. 37,000 B.P.)
contributed to the significance of the site, more recent work (Stanford 1981) has resolved the
controversy concerning the date of the occupation. It appears that the presence of naturally
occurring lignite as either a fuel in these hearths or an inadvertent inclusion contaminated the
radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted date of 12,000-10,000 B.P. for Clovisperiod occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of North
Central Texas. Our knowledge of the settlement-subsistence strategies used by these early
occupants is extremely limited. However, recent excavation at the Aubrey site, a well-preserved
Clovis-period site in Denton County, has indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big
game animals alone; rather, the entire range of prairie and forest species were used (C. Reid
Ferring, personal communication 1989). Whether this pattern of a more generalized foraging
subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis adaptations in the Eastern Woodlands and the focus
on now extinct, big game species is more characteristic of a Plains adaptation remains to be
documented.
Our knowledge of the Archaic period in the Upper Trinity River drainage is limited by the lack of
data from major excavations. This is particularly true for the Early and Middle Archaic periods.
Recent investigations along the West Fork (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986)
indicate that primary contexts for Early and Middle Archaic sites will be found deeply buried
within floodplain alluvium. Artifacts from these periods are found on terrace surfaces, but they
are frequently mixed with later materials. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic period
(Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based upon
materials from such terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer
recognized as being acceptable for North Central Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987;
Yates and Ferring 1986).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at Lake Ray Roberts indicate that
the Late Archaic period is characterized by assemblages left by small bands of foraging hunters
and gatherers who occupied a locality for a limited time period and then moved to another
locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied numerous times on a seasonal basis. Deer and
numerous small mammals were the primary food resources. The documentation of large pits
associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland/Chambers Creek drainage (Bruseth and
Martin 1987) suggests that important sociopolitical changes may have been occurring during this
time period. Unfortunately, the significance of these pits remains an enigma despite their
excellent documentation.
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the Upper Trinity River Basin is marked by the
initial appearance of arrow points. The date of A.D. 700 for this period is based upon dated
contexts to the west in the Brazos River drainage. Lynott (1977) suggests that the Late
Prehistoric period may be divided into an early and late phase. The early phase is characterized
by sand and grog tempered ceramics, Scallorn and Alba arrow points, and a continuation of the
foraging subsistence system of the Late Archaic period. The late phase reflects a Southern Plains
influence with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various
unstemmed triangular points (e.g., Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point. Evidence of
12

horticulture and the procurement of bison also appear in sites of this period (Harris and Harris
1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Prikrylâs (1987) recent assessment of the Late Prehistoric period
largely follows that of Lynott (1977).
Investigations of the Cobb-Pool site at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have resulted in
a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site has yielded house structures,
roasting pits, Alba points, grog tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates
from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth
century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddoan
occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred during a middle
phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics were not introduced to the
region before this time.
Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive
change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however, recent
analysis of a Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in northeastern
Dallas County also suggests maize consumption. The individual was a female around 50 years
old. Radiocarbon dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155-1275, while a
carbon isotope ratio of â17.7% suggests that maize was consumed, but it did not form a major
part of her diet (Peter and Clow 1999). These indications of maize consumption contrast with a
small grouping of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) in
Dallas County. This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity
River) yielded remains of at least four individuals dated by radiocarbon dating of bone collagen
to cal A.D. 1010 (1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although shell beads
and a shell gorget were present; and a carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 percent suggests that the
groupâs diet was not high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given the slightly earlier date of the
Harbor Pointe burials compared to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is possible that maize agriculture
was introduced to the Dallas area ca. A.D. 1200; conversely, this same evidence may indicate that
divergent subsistence patterns were practiced by groups in the Dallas area.
Historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the Protohistoric period
in the Upper Trinity River Basin. Tonkawa, Wichita, Caddo, and Comanche all are likely to have
traversed the area. However, exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data are
almost nonexistent. Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953) appear on a limited
number of sites, no protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated and characterizations of
the Native American adaptations during this time period are conjectural at best. A lack of
documentary evidence, together with a lack of interest among ethnologists and archeologists, has
contributed to this situation.

HISTORIC OCCUPATION/UTILIZATION
The pressure of the westward movement of Anglo-American settlers displaced numerous Native
Americans from their homelands to the north and east of North Central Texas. Delaware,
Chickasaw, Waco, Cherokee, Shawnee, Caddo, and Kichai sought refuge in North Central Texas.
Skirmishes and raids were frequent in the 1830s, and it was not until 1843 that Sam Houston,
President of the Republic of Texas, met with the Indian tribes at the abandoned Birdâs Fort in
nearby Tarrant County and signed a peace treaty. Captain Jonathan Bird and a small group of
settlers had attempted to establish the first Anglo-American settlement in the area in 1840;
13

however, the fort was abandoned by the spring of 1842. Apparently the lack of supplies and the
difficulty of communicating with the settlements in Northeast Texas contributed to this
abandonment. However, by 1845 the influx of settlers, enticed by commercial land development
enterprises such as the Peters' Colony, resulted in the movement of the frontier farther west.
By 1846 the Texas Legislature had created Collin County from Fannin County and named it after
Collin McKinney, an early settler who signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. Buckner
was the original county seat, but it was moved to McKinney in 1848. By 1850 the city of Dallas
had become the county seat of Dallas County and was developing into a mercantile center
because of its position on the Trinity River. Population and commercial growth continued in
Dallas into the 1860s when the Civil War had a dramatic effect on both the population and their
business enterprises. By the mid-1870s, however, Dallas had become a major distribution center
for buffalo hides and a marketing center for cotton (Reese et al. 1986:164). Cotton farming
became the major agricultural activity within the rich Blackland Prairie. As was common in areas
dependent on cotton, tenant farming was a major social institution. The economy of the area was
largely dependent upon agriculture until the turn-of-the-century when the railroad and the
discovery of oil significantly affected the economy and market accessibility of the area.
Although the area surrounding Lake Lavon remains rural in character, the rapid growth of the
Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is slowly encroaching upon it.

CHAPTER 4
METHODS

The Texas Site Atlas (nueces.thc.state.tx.us) was consulted prior to beginning field work. One
previously recorded site (41COL143), a historic farm, was mapped within a 1-mile radius of the
APE. The site does not fall within the current APE and is discussed in the previous research
section of this report.
The project area was surveyed traveling east along FM 455 from US 75 to SH 121 using
windshield and pedestrian survey. The survey began by driving the length of the APE to assess
the condition of the existing and new ROW as well as the nine drainage crossings. The condition
of the APE and drainage crossings was documented with digital photographs. The pedestrian
survey also began at the west end of the project area at US 75 and proceeded east to the
intersection of FM 455 and SH 121. Surface inspection was conducted in the existing and
proposed ROW in the APE. The cut bank survey was conducted at all drainage crossings as they
were encountered during the pedestrian survey. No cultural material was observed during the
surface inspection or cut bank survey.
Shovel testing was not conducted due to the type and amount of previous disturbance in the
existing and proposed ROW. The likelihood of cultural deposits in this upland setting with very
small intermittent drainages is minimal. Six of the nine drainages begin within 500 feet of FM
455 and have banks that are approximately 2 feet deep at the crossing of FM 455: the tributary of
Throckmorton Creek which has also been channelized to flow through a retention pond, the east
and west tributaries of Slayter Creek, and three of the four unmanned tributaries of Sister Grove
Creek (1, 2, 4) (See Figure 2). Tributary 3 of Sister Grove Creek has three to four foot banks and
is surrounded by terraced pasture and Throckmorton and Slayter Creeks are larger but surrounded
by development In addition, agricultural practices and construction have disturbed almost the
entire APE. The disturbances in the more developed portion of the APE west of the Town of
Anna; consisted of road construction, sub-divisions, shopping plazas, landscaping, driveways,
culverts, bridges, erosional gullies draining into the creeks, and erosion control measures along
the side of the road, particularly near drainages. The disturbances in the APE east of Anna
consisted primarily of plowing and terracing of farmland with some road construction, culverts,
driveways, and erosion. The environmental setting is uplands with very little water. The type
and amount of disturbance leaves little probability of any cultural deposits and less probability of
cultural deposits with integrity existing in the APE.
15

Fifteen structures of historic age were identified in the APE but will not be discussed in detail
here (see Thomas 2006). The surface around these structures was examined for locations likely
to contain intact archeological deposits where shovel tests could be excavated. No suitable
locations were observed due to previous disturbance by road construction, driveways,
outbuildings, pipelines, utility lines, and/or the proximity of other structures. Digital photographs
were taken to illustrate the conditions of the project area. No cultural material was recovered.
All notes, forms, and photographs will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

The entire APE is situated in an upland environment. Starting at the west end, the APE begins at
the intersection of US 75 and FM 455. The east interchange between US 75 and FM 455 is
developed with truck stops and fast food restaurants. FM 455 heads east, down hill, to
Throckmorton Creek, a deep steep-sided intermittent drainage (Figure 3). On the slope of the
hill, on the south side of FM 455, rip rap has been placed at intervals in the eroding roadside ditch
that empties into Throckmorton Creek (Figure 4). Creek Side, a residential subdivision, has been
constructed on the east bank of Throckmorton Creek, on the north side of FM 455. The area
between the subdivision and the road has been heavily landscaped with a retention pond and a
park area with a manicured lawn. A tributary of Throckmorton Creek feeds the pond and the
channel has been altered to flow along the north edge of FM 455 and into Throckmorton Creek
(Figure 5). At the top of the next hill, Oak Hollow, a residential subdivision, has been constructed
on the south side of FM 455. A landscaped, manicured lawn with trees and fence lie between the
road and the subdivision (Figure 6). On the north side of FM 455 across from Oak Hollow is,
Stetson Ranch, another subdivision, also with a landscaped manicured lawn. Approximately 0.5
miles west of Slayter Creek, two very small intermittent tributaries of Slayter Creek cross the
APE. The tributaries begin within 500 feet of the north side of FM 455 and the banks are about 2
feet high at FM 455 (Figures 7 and 8). A new shopping plaza is also located on the south side of
FM 455 east of Westfield Drive (Figure 9). A manicured lawn and a parking lot are located in the
ROW in front of the shopping plaza. Approximately 1.5 miles east of US 75, at the bottom of the
hill, is Slayter Creek, a deep steep-sided intermittent drainage with erosion control measures
including rip rap and silt fencing surrounding a sewer line on the north side of FM 455. A
concrete ditch on the northeast bank directs water into Slayter Creek (Figure 10).
The busiest intersection in the project area is the FM 455/Powell Road (SH 5) intersection (Figure
11). The corners of the intersection are developed with a residence on the northwest and
southwest corners, a gas station/convenience store on the northeast corner, and a fast food
restaurant on the southeast corner. Just east of this intersection is a crossing, at grade, of the
Southern Pacific Railroad (Figure 12). East of the railroad crossing is a school building on the
north side and a plowed field and residence on the south side of FM 455. A buried utility line
runs along FM 455 adjacent to the plowed field. A new road is being constructed 0.5 miles east
of the SH 5 intersection with FM 455 (Figure 13). East of the road is a residence under
construction with a new set of utility pipes and valves. The remainder (4 miles) of the project

area is rural land with an occasional residence (Figure 14). Four tributaries of Sister Grove Creek
begin within 1,000 feet of FM 455 and cross the APE between mile 2.5 and 5 of the project area
(see Figure 2). Tributary 1 is a shallow, intermittent drainage with sloping, vegetated banks
(Figure 15). Tributary 2 is a narrow, shallow intermittent drainage with limestone bed rock
showing in the 2 foot high banks (Figure 16). Tributary 3 is the most developed of the unnamed
tributaries in the APE. The banks, lined with limestone bedrock, are about 4 feet high and are
somewhat steep sided (Figure 17). Tributary 4 is a shallow intermittent drainage with sloping
vegetated banks about 1-2 feet high (Figure 18). Evidence of dumping is present on all of the
creek banks throughout the project area and includes concrete and asphalt fragments, large pieces
of metal, appliances, plastic, and cardboard (Figure 19; see Figures 7, 8, and 17). No cultural
materials were observed in the creek banks. A sign for a new subdivision, Sheffield Farms, has
been constructed on the north side of FM 455, in the ROW approximately 1 mile west of SH 121
(Figure 20). A few homes have been constructed in this subdivision well outside (north) of the
APE.

The farm land has been plowed and the pasture disturbed by terracing. The terracing is visible at
ground level and in aerial photographs (Figures 21 and 22). Bedrock is visible at the surface in
the east end of the APE and in the creek banks (Figure 23). Recent disturbances of the APE
include; construction of sewer and water lines, pipelines, erosion control measure, culverts, run
off channels, and dumping (Figures 24â27).
No cultural materials were found during the current survey on the surface or in the creek banks.
Modern trash was observed throughout the APE and is most likely the result of road side
dumping.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The project consists of reconnaissance, pedestrian, and cut bank survey of existing and new rightof-way (ROW) along FM 455 between US 75 and SH 121 in Collin County, Texas. The APE is
6.4 miles long and the ROW varies in width between 70 and 118 feet on either side of FM 455.

The APE falls completely in an upland environment and the mapped soils are all upland and
eroded uplands soils (Coffee and Ressell 1981). The purpose of the cultural resources
investigation in this project area is to determine the presence/absence of archeological resources
and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended,
or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Due to the upland environment of the project area shallow soils, particularly on the less
developed east half of the APE the small, shallow, intermittent drainages and the recent
development and construction in the APE, it is unlikely that the area would contain any
subsurface archeological deposits with contextual integrity. The pedestrian survey of the existing
and proposed ROW found that large sections of the APE have been adversely affected by
previous construction, excavation, erosion, erosion control, terracing, and dumping. No cultural
materials were found during the survey on the surface or in the creek banks.

No historic properties were identified during the current survey. As a result of these
investigations, it is recommended that the proposed widening and alterations of FM 455 will not
effect archeological historic properties and that no further work is required.
