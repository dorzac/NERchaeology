CATHEY NORTH TIE LINE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY

INTRODUCTION
On July 18, 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a pedestrian archaeological survey of
approximately one-half mile of a proposed tie line route. The study area is located
approximately 4 miles north of Alba in Wood County, Texas. The proposed route begins
at the intersection of County Road 515 and County Road 17 and will connect two
existing lines along CR 17. The proposed route is 0.5 miles long and is shown in Figure
1. The archaeological survey was done at the request of Wood County Electric
Cooperative (WCEC) of Quitman, Texas to meet the USDA, Public Utilities Commission
[PUC] requirements. In addition, the Texas Historical Commission [THC] would review
the project and was likely to recommend an archaeological survey since significant
prehistoric and historic sites have been recorded throughout Wood County.
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if archaeological sites were
present, how they might be impacted and make recommendations about their
significance. Various federal and state environmental legislation has a direct bearing on
the consideration of the substation construction and proposed access route. The report
also would be reviewed by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission
as part of their Section 106 review process. Relevant federal legislation includes the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291). The Texas Antiquities Code is not
applicable to this project.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural and cultural environment of Wood and Smith Counties. This is followed by
the methodology. The results of the investigation follow and the last chapter presents
recommendations.

NATURAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
Natural Environment
The underlying geology of the project location is mapped as Wilcox group undivided, a
Tertiary-aged silty and sandy clay (Bureau of Economic Geology 1975). Soil in the
proposed substation location belongs to the Woodtell-Freestone association (Hatherly
2000: General Soils Map). Soils in this association are described as gently sloping to
moderately steep and formed in the uplands under dominantly hardwood forests. The
specific soils in the study area are Woodtell loam with 2 to 5 percent slopes, Freestone
fine sandy loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes, and Derly-Raino complex of flat loam and
clay loam (Hatherly 2000: Sheet 7).

The natural vegetation of Wood County is characterized as the Post Oak Savannah
(Diamond, Riskind, and Orzell 1987: Figure 1). Large mammals in this region include
white-tail deer. There is a variety of smaller mammals such as gray and red fox, bobcat,

coyote, skunk, raccoon, mink, opossum, beaver, muskrat, armadillo, rabbit, squirrel and
others (Davis and Schmidly 1994; Schmidly 1983).
Culture History
A variety of historic and prehistoric cultural resources are known for the Sulphur, Red,
Sabine and Neches Watersheds in East Texas. These include a wealth of prehistoric
Caddoan Indian villages and cemeteries as well as the structural remains of nineteenth
and early twentieth century American settlements. These remains have been described by
numerous authors listed in References Cited.
The earliest occupation appears to have been by 9,500 B.C., based on the presence of
fluted Clovis and Folsom dart points. These and other finely crafted projectiles have been
recovered in numerous places, but always on the surface of the ground. They have yet to
be discovered in a primary context. Prehistoric occupation in this region was continuous
up to historic times. Around A.D. 1300, a shift in site location away from the major
drainages and into the headwaters of smaller tributaries resulted in the rearrangement of
people into small but numerous hamlets scattered throughout the region of northeast
Texas. Historic Anglo settlement of the region began in the early 1800s, and the Native
Americans subsequently moved or were pushed out of the area. Prior to, during and after
the Civil War, industries in Wood County consisted of sawmills, felt and leather and
stoneware.
No archaeological sites were found within or adjacent to the study area on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (2008). One lithic scatter site, 41WD446, consists of four lithic
flakes and one piece of fire-cracked rock. It is located on the north side of CR 515 and
will not be impacted by the current project.

METHODOLOGY
AR Consultants conducted a pedestrian survey of the route on July 18, 2008. The
proposed route is one-half mile in length, but upon inspection it appears that the
construction will only affect about half that distance. Two existing distribution lines end
along this small section of CR 17, and the proposed Cathey North tie line will connect
these two ends. No more than four new poles should be necessary. Due to the curve in
the road and land acquisition concerns, the tie line may be placed on either or both sides
of the paved road, so the two-person crew from AR Consultants surveyed both sides of
CR 17.
The potential for archaeological sites in this upland setting is low, and there is prior
disturbance due to the construction of the road and Lake Fork Reservoir. The route was
examined visually and two shovel tests were excavated. The ground cover consists of
grass that has recently been mowed, and ground surface visibility was between 40 and 50
percent in most places. The slopes of the ditches along the road were frequently bare of
vegetation and soil erosion offered good visibility. Shovel tests were excavated to
approximately 20 centimeters below ground surface and the sediment and pit walls were

examined visually for cultural materials. Notes were made of relevant information such
as the terrain, soil color, vegetation, ground visibility, etc. Photographs also were taken.
Backhoe trenching was not done due to the shallow depth to the subsoil. Historic sites
might be encountered because the study area is adjacent to a transportation route.
Prehistoric sites were expected due to the upland setting and proximity to water.

RESULTS
This portion of the report is divided into two parts. The study area is discussed first and
followed by a description of the survey. Shovel tests are described generally in the text
and specific information is provided in Table 1. Shovel test locations are plotted on
Figure 1.

The study area
The study area consists of ridges of Woodtell loam, with a shallow sandy layer overlying
a red clay subsoil. The route crosses an intermittent tributary that drains into Lake Fork
Reservoir. This shallow drainage extends westward from the Reservoir to CR 17. Road
construction has cut through the ridges. The land is planted in coastal bermuda grass
which is regularly mowed. Ground visibility was at least 40 percent and eye-height was
excellent. The proposed route begins at CR 515 and runs generally south and parallels
CR 17. The route is adjacent to residences on the east side of the road and fenced fields
and commercial structures and parking lots on the west side. A typical portion of the
proposed route is shown in Figure 2.

The survey
Survey began on the east side of CR 17 approximately one-half mile south of CR 515 and
went north, then crossed to the west side of the road and went south along the ditch and
fence line. Due to the excellent ground visibility and the short length, only two shovel
tests were excavated along the proposed route; no cultural materials were seen in the
shovel tests or on the ground surfaces. The upper sand ranged from less than 3
centimeters deep along the ridge top to 9 to 15 centimeters deep in the shovel tests, and
varied from very pale brown to light yellowish brown. The sandy clay subsoil contact
depths ranged from 3 to 15 centimeters below ground surface.
A historic log structure is present in the field on the west side of the proposed route. The
structure is built of round, saddle-notched logs typical of outbuildings and most common
in the early 1900s in the region (Jordan 1978). The structure lies over 250 feet west of
the fence line on the west side of CR 17, and is therefore well outside of the project rightof-way and will not be affected by the construction of the tie line. A rectangular patch of

cultivated irises (genus Iris) was observed growing along the fence line on the west side
of the road. This type of pattern is often a vegetative marker of historic homes. However,
if any historic foundations are present, they should be visible because the vegetation
along the county road right-of-way is mowed. No such foundations were observed in
association with the irises, and no other historic structures were found.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of historic or prehistoric occupation was found at the proposed construction
route. The proposed tie-line is located in the uplands away from major prehistoric water
sources, although the Lake Fork Creek, prior to the construction of the Reservoir, was
within a mile of the study area. Farming of this location has likely disturbed any
archaeological sites that may have been present at or near the surface, and yet this failed
to expose any evidence of buried prehistoric or historic occupation.
AR Consultants, Inc. believes that no significant cultural resources will be impacted by
construction of the proposed substation and access route and that further cultural resource
evaluations are unwarranted. We request the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission concur with this recommendation. We further recommend that the Texas
Historical Commission be contacted immediately if buried cultural resources are
uncovered during land modification associated with substation construction. If this
circumstance should arise, work should immediately cease in the area of the uncovered
cultural resources until professional consultation has been concluded.

Dear Mr. Martin:
Enclosed for your review is a draft copy of the cultural resources letter report of the
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the Cathey North Tie Line route located
northeast of Alba in Wood County, Texas. No cultural materials were found on the
ground surface of the access route and substation location during the pedestrian survey or
in 2 shovel tests. AR Consultants, Inc. believes that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted and requests the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission agree with this recommendation. We further recommend that if
buried cultural materials are encountered during construction, work should stop
immediately in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission be notified. Work should not continue until consultations with the Texas
Historical Commission have been concluded.

If you have questions, please contact me at either 214.368.0478 or arcdigs@aol.com.
