Many a Slip ’Twixt Cup and Lip: Correcting Perdiz
Statistics from the Buckhollow Site Report
LeRoy Johnson

Just before the report on the Buckhollow site
(Johnson 1994) went to press, the t-scores of Table
9 were reviewed and corrected--wrongly, as it
turned out. The calculator which was used had definitely gone quite bonkers, and had outlived its usefulness. Regrettably, that fact was not discovered
until after the "revised" table was published. It thus
falls upon me to offer a proper and corrected table
since copies of the Buckhollow site report have
been disseminated far afield. The data of Table 9
are important, for they test the significance of differences between pairs of dimensional means for
collections of Perdiz arrow points from three major archeological sites: Buckhollow, Las Haciendas, and Hinojosa.
Hopefully, the interested reader will review
the new table below. The null hypothesis of no real
difference between means is everywhere rejected
(even when c~ is .06 or .07), except where an (X)
appears in the table’s right-hand margin. For the
compared Perdiz points from Buckhollow and Las
Haciendas, differences between means that are not
considered significant are for variables H (mean
maximum length) and I (mean maximum width).
For H, the difference between means is only 1.4
mm, a small cipher, indeed. For I the difference is
merely 0.8 mm. It is likely that the lack of significance in differences is real, and not due to the
effects of undersampling (see totals in Johnson
1994:Table 8).
For the compared collections from Buckhollow
and Hinojosa, all pairs of means for which tests

were figured can be said to be significantly different. However, the means for variable J (mean maximum thickness), with a difference of 0.3 mm, give
borderline results.
For the collections of Perdiz points from Las
Haciendas and Hinojosa, pairs of means are significantly different except for variable J (mean maximum thickness) and variable K (mean stem width).
Given the lack of sizeable differences in these cases
(0.1 mm for both variables), it is unlikely that the
lack of significance would be remedied much by
increasing sample sizes.
In sum, it seems that Buckhollow and Las
Haciendas Perdiz points may be virtually identical
(as measured by the means) in terms of length and
maximum width. It is also likely that Las
Haciendas and Hinojosa Perdiz points share truly
similar means for maxiumum thickness and stem
width.
