Archeological Inventory of 99 Acres at Lake Wright Patman, Texas

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on 99 acres in Cass County, Texas. The project area is located
within the Mill Creek South management unit at Lake Wright Patman. Work was conducted at
the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers,
Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting within the parcels
and, in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was
undertaken to ensure that any cultural resource sites located on the parcels would be considered
in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archaeological fieldwork was conducted on May 1-3, 2004. Fieldwork included a 100%
pedestrian inventory accompanied by 75 shovel tests. Only five of the tests were positive, and
recovered historic ceramics, metal, and glass. All subsurface artifacts were recovered and will
be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
The inventory documented two new archaeological sites. Both of these are the remains of
twentieth century farmsteads and both sites are evaluated as being of undetermined eligibility for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Both of the sites should be
avoided until such time as a clear assessment of eligibility can be made.

1.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1 THE UNDERTAKING

The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally-owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs and
navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 45,063 acres at Lake Wright
Patman, outside of conservation pool level. Much of this acreage is forested by mature pine and
pine-hardwood stands.

In conjunction with the existing management plans for the several

reservoirs and in accordance with accepted silviculture methodologies, the USACE has planned
certain management areas for selective timber thinning.

Commercial thinning removes

marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through single tree selection. Removal of
crop trees often disturbs the ground surface but extensive subsurface disturbance is not common.

While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account, and in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89-665 et
seq.), the inventory was authorized by the USACE to identify any archaeological sites, buildings,
structures, or other resources that may be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). The inventory was conducted exclusively on lands owned by the
Federal Government and managed by the USACE.

1.2 LOCATION

Lake Wright Patman is on the Sulphur River 18 km southwest of Texarkana in Bowie and Cass
Counties. The far upstream portions of the reservoir extend into Morris, Titus, and Red River
Counties. Initially known as Texarkana Reservoir, the lake was renamed in the late 1970s in
honor of the East Texas congressman (Breeding 2002). The dam was constructed between 1948
and 1957 and impounds an area of 20,300 acres. Conservation pool elevation is 220 ft AMSL.

The Mill Creek South survey area is in Cass County about 10 km north northwest of Queen City
(see Figure 1). This parcel is bordered on the east by CR 3555 and on the northwest by Lake
Wright Patman. The elevation ranges from approximately 220 ft at the shoreline to 370 ft
AMSL. The tract measures about 780 m by east to west by about 625 m north to south and totals
99 acres. It is plotted on the Atlanta North USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangle.

1.3 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The project is located in the Piney Woods region of East Texas. Forested areas in the region
included secondary growth and mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. Pine stands observed
during the field inventory were typically comprised of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf (Pinus
echinata), and longleaf (Pinus palustris) pines. Hardwood trees were predominantly various
oaks, including southern red oak (Quercus falcate) and white oak (Quercus alba), and the
American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). Figure 2 illustrates a typical view for the project.

Wildlife common to the area included whitetail deer, red fox, bobcat, tree squirrels, raccoons,
opossums, armadillo, nutria, otters, and mink. Lake habitats support a variety of turtles, frogs
and snakes, as well as largemouth bass, flathead catfish, channel catfish, white and black crappie,
white bass, and bluegill and other sunfish. Bird species include the endangered red-cockaded
woodpecker, as well as bald eagles, osprey, bobwhite, mourning dove, common loons, herons,
and egrets.

2.0 PREVIOUS RESEARCH
2.1 PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

No previous cultural resource inventories have been conducted within the current project area.
In 1970, a 100 m (328 ft) wide shoreline survey was conducted by the New Orleans District of
the USACE (Briggs and Malone 1970). This inventory included the entire shoreline of the lake,
which was named Lake Texarkana at that time, and surveyed a narrow strip of the current project
area along the shore line. This survey recorded one site, 41CS59 (Table 1), which may possibly
be located within the current project area, although the siteâs precise location is uncertain. The
lat-long coordinates given place the site well inland, although it was certainly within the surveyâs
100 m shoreline corridor Further, the site form on record at TARL for this site describes it as a
âvery limited area with few artifacts within small oval 2 by 1 metersâ (Malone 1970), while the
location of the site is plotted on the USGS maps as an oval approximately 240 m long along the
shoreline by about 120 m wide. The reason for the difference in size is most likely due to the
siteâs uncertain location and consequent liberal plotting of the site area on the USGS location
maps. While most of the oval is located north of the current project area, a small part overlaps it.
If in fact the site is a very small scatter that is located somewhere within the larger oval, then the
site has only about a 10% chance of being within the current project area. Artifacts recorded on
the site included prehistoric ceramics, lithic debitage and an otherwise undescribed projectile
point.

In the general vicinity of the current project area, an additional 22 sites have been recorded
within a 1 mile (1.6 km) radius (Table 1). The majority of these are shoreline sites that were
recorded by Malone in 1970, and none are further inland from the modern lake than 450 m. Most
of the site reports have minimal information on file. For the most part, the terse site descriptions
indicate small to medium sized scatters of ceramics and lithics with occasional undescribed
projectile points. One site (41CS54) is noted as having Maud and Banett (sic, Bassett?) projectile
points, both of which date to the late prehistoric (Suhm and Jelks 1962: 265, 281; Turner and
Hester 1993:201, 223). Three of the sites (41CS57, 41CS60, 41CS93) are recorded as being
aceramic with lithics only, but most of these sites have plain and/or decorated sherds. These are

occasionally described as having sandy paste, presumably Caddoan. One site is recorded as
having burials. Site 41CS125 (the âGreen Farm Siteâ) is located on an off-shore island, about
800 m northwest of the project area. In 1959, burials were reported to be washing out of the site
but further information is not available.

2.2 PREHISTORIC CULTURAL FRAMEWORK

Humans have lived in the East Texas region for at least 11,000 years. The currently accepted
framework of culture history has been outlined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) in a planning
document for East Texas. This framework includes Paleo-Indian populations (prior to 7000
B.C.), and Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-100 B.C.), though the Caddoan horticultural
adaptations (A.D. 900-1700).

These time periods are based on changes in environment,

technology, and/or population requiring cultural adaptations to meet varying circumstances.

The prehistory of East Texas has been investigated by many archaeological investigations. For
cultural-historical details of the prehistoric period, the reader is referred to Kenmotsu and
Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993; 1995). Many small investigations have been conducted by
the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), on rural developments by the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA), and for various projects for utilities and mineral interests. Of
these small projects, the inventories crossing lowland areas have generally recorded higher site
densities than the upland inventories. Larger investigations have been focused on reservoirs
(Perttula et al. 1998) and on the Big Thicket National Preserve (Shafer et al. 1975; Brown et al.
1999). Large investigations in the region generally show that both prehistoric and historic sites
were found adjacent to the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges.
In general, areas around stream confluences and on small rises within floodplains had a good to

excellent chance of containing prehistoric cultural resources while historic resources can be in
more diverse conditions, including areas away from water.

2.3 HISTORIC PERIOD

The original inhabitants of East Texas are believed to have been first contacted by Europeans
between 1528 and 1533 by the Spanish explorer, Cabeza de Vaca.

This foray may have

encountered Caddoan people somewhere between Nacogdoches, Texas and Natchitoches,
Louisiana. It was followed by the explorer Moscoso, whose report of crossing the Angelina
River mentions several distinct Caddoan groups including the Ayish, Nondacoa, Nasoni,
Nacacahoz, and Naquisca. The French Explorer La Salle in 1685 also reported Hasinai Caddo
near Nacogdoches and in 1690 the Spanish began establishing a series of missions in the area,
including two at Nacogdoches by 1716. The Spaniards reported that the local people actively
cultivated fields of maize, which they supplemented with gardens of beans, squash, and other
vegetables, as well as hunting and fishing. Trot lining was a common fishing technique. Surplus
maize was often traded with neighboring people.

The Historic Period (1700-present) describes the history behind the current cultural setting of the
area and also marks a transition from the native populations to the European immigrantsâ
establishment of farms, towns, and counties.

As the indigenous groups were exposed to

Europeans, trade items such as glass beads, metal points, buttons, and gun parts made their way
into the archaeological record. Unfortunately, contact with the Europeans also brought new
diseases, which severely reduced the populations of the Caddoan villages. The descendants of
these people now reside primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.

The first likely European expedition into the area around Lake Wright Patman was led by Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto expedition into
the southeastern U.S. and took over after he died in 1539. Looking for an overland route back to
New Spain, he crossed into the territory that became Bowie County and used existing trails
established by the Caddo to move further into the interior of Texas before turning around and
traveling back to the coast (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993). French visitors to the area included

Archeological Inventory of 99 Acres at Lake Wright Patman, Texas

Henri Jountel, who was part of the LaSalle expedition, and Henri de Tonti, who went to the area
to look for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper 2002b). Permanent European presence began
in 1719, when Le Poste des Cadodaquious was established by the French at a location just to the
northwest of Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served more as a trading
station and supply base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years after the
Louisiana cession to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish, under the
name San Luiz de los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni tribes with whom they were trying to foster a
relationship left the area soon after (Britton 2002). Finally, the Americans explored the area in
1806 when the Red River Expedition launched by Thomas Jefferson traveled up the Red River to
Spanish Bluff, where they were forced to turn back by Spanish soldiers.

Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass Counties began in
the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee, Delaware, and
Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on within ten years. By
1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and county lines had been resolved.
The white settlers were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton plantations as
well as raising corn, hogs, and some cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave population
outnumbered the white population in Bowie County, and numbered just under half in Cass
County (Harper 2002a; Harper 2002b).

As was expected, the white population strongly

supported the secession movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took
place in the area, federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmenâs
Bureau to assist black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed
white residents, who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and secretly
supported anti-black movements such as Cullen Bakerâs gang and the Ku Klux Klan.

By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up in
the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village, where two
major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the largest
trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was founded
in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an economic center for the surrounding rural
community (Hazlewood 2002; Harper 2002c).

The entire area remained primarily rural with an agricultural economy, but small manufacturing
also employed some of the local population. The Depression had a devastating effect on the
area, but World War II brought the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone
Star Army Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of the local residents from
that point forward (Harper 2002a). Changes in the economic market drew many people away
from farming and into manufacturing and trade. However, populations grew slowly, if at all, and
the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Lake Wright Patman was completed in 1957 and
provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.

3.0 FIELD METHODS
The archaeological field inventory was conducted on May 1-3, 2004. Five person-days were spent
in the field by the author and one technician. Methods and density of shovel testing complied with
the requirements for field tactics stipulated by the USACE (2002:10-44). The work plan for this
area called for survey coverage greater than or equal to one shovel test per two acres (0.5 ST/acre)
with transect intervals of approximately 30 m. A minimum of 50 shovel tests was thus required.
This shovel testing density was exceeded and 75 tests were placed for a net density of 0.8 ST/acre

The field crew navigated using hand-held GPS receivers and the survey was guided by transect
lines drawn at 30 m intervals on topographic maps. The location of each shovel test was marked
Transect lines were designated with an alpha prefix and individual shovel test along each transect
line were numbered, so that shovel test B-5 identified the fifth test along the second transect
(Transect B). Survey tactics were selected for optimum efficiency and included both leapfrogging as well as each surveyor following separate transects. Where possible, tests were
selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to be preferred site locations, such
as ridge lines, knolls, and promontories. Six of the 75 tests could not be dug due to steep slopes
and these locations were individually recorded on the shovel testing log.

All shovel tests were 30 to 35 cm in diameter. Nearly all of the tests were dug to the bottom of
the Holocene deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cm below ground surface if no clay was
present. The only exceptions were eight tests which were terminated above the clay due to rock
slabs, large roots, or inundation, and six of the nine tests on historic site 41CS289 which were
terminated at the base of the historic artifact horizon â 40 cmbs - as demonstrated in the other
tests on this site. Tests were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and
cultural material present. Tests were dug in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in
thickness and all excavated material was screened through Â¼-inch (6.4 mm) stainless steel mesh.
All cultural material was collected with the exception of recent objects such as bottle glass
shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to indicate recent disturbance and
were not collected. All shovel tests were backfilled.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 9

Archeological Inventory of 99 Acres at Lake Wright Patman, Texas

Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in the
immediate vicinity at 10 to 15 m distances for up to a total of six tests in an area 25 to 30 m
diameter. If more than one of these tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found
in any single test, then the location was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was
designated as an isolated occurrence. Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple
shovel tests in the area to identify zones of zero or low artifact presence.

Based on the

distribution of negative shovel tests, site boundaries were prominently marked with pink-glo
flagging tape. Sites were photographed, sketch mapped and recorded using State of Texas site
forms. All excavated artifacts were recovered and were processed and analyzed by the authors in
Ecological Communications Corporationâs (ECommâs) Austin laboratory. All artifacts, notes
and records will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), at the
University of Texas, Austin, upon completion of analysis.

Subsequent to completion of field work, a search of historic maps and aerial photographs was
conducted at the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) in Austin.

4.0 RESULTS
The inventory at the Mill Creek south parcel at Lake Wright Patman investigated a total of 99
acres using 75 shovel tests. Six tests could not be dug due to steep slopes with 69 tests being dug.
Final testing density was thus 0.7 tests per acre. The locations of shovel tests are plotted in
Appendix A. Soil profiles were moderately shallow throughout the parcel (Table 2). Only four
of the tests (5%) could be dug to 80 cm or deeper without encountering clay but two-thirds of all
tests were at least 40 cm deep and only three tests were shallower than 20 cm. The typical soil
profile consisted of 40-50 cm of brown to reddish
brown (7.5YR 5/3) fine, sandy loam over red to

the average depth of clay was 46 cm below the
surface.

discovered sites were documented.

4.1 SITE 41CS59
Site 41CS59 was recorded by Malone in 1970 during an inventory of the shoreline of Lake
Wright Patman. The precise location of the site is uncertain (see Section 2.1, above), but there is
a small possibility that it is within the current survey area. This potential area was closely
inspected but no evidence of the site was observed. A shovel test placed in this area was
negative. It is likely that the site is actually located outside of the current project area, along the
beach to the north.

4.2 SITE 41CS288
Site 41CS288 is a newly discovered, small historic site. It is located on a hill overlooking Mill
Creek, a tributary to the Sulphur River (now Lake Wright Patman).

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archeological Inventory of 99 Acres at Lake Wright Patman, Texas

The site is defined on the basis of single historic feature.
This is a rectangular, subsurface root-cellar or storm
cellar (Feature 1). The long axis of the cellar oriented
north to south and the long sides (i.e., the east and west
faces) are intact, vertical concrete slabs. The top of these
slabs is flush with the current ground surface.

The

horizontal distance between these slabs measures exactly
60 inches (5 ft) wide. The northern and southern faces of
the cellar also have concrete slabs but these are broken
ST

and collapsed and the short faces of the cellar are largely
slumped earthen slope. This long dimension is less certain
but is approximately 120 inches (10 ft) (Figure 3). The
cellar is at least 1 m (3 ft) deep, but it has an unknown
amount of post-abandonment fill, and is probably deeper.

One shovel test was dug in the bottom of the feature. This

observed on the ground surface of the site. No other
features were observed on the site, but the area of the site

Figure 3. Feature 1, Site 41CS288

has been overgrown with a thicket of tangled vegetation
and it is possible that additional features are buried
beneath this layer.

The siteâs location closely matches that of a structure that can be seen plotted on the 1910 USGS
15â topographic quadrangle (Figure 4). The subsequent USGS topographic map was made in
1969, after construction of Lake Texarkana (Lake Wright Patman) and after acquisition of the
property by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and does not show any structure in this location.

area is indicated by shading. The circled structures match the locations of sites
41CS288 and 41CS289.

Aerial photographs from 1949 and 1954 both show a clearing in this location (Figures 5 and 6)
while the 1970 aerial photograph does not show any clearing. Resolution of the aerial images is
not sufficient to determine whether or not a structure was present. However, close examination
of the 1954 photograph reveals the bright image of a dirt road through the clearing, suggesting
that the road was actively being used. Also, within the clearing a bright area adjacent to the road
and underneath several trees suggests an actively used turnaround, parking area, or other ground
disturbed activity area.

Figure 6. 1954 Aerial photograph of project area. The circled clearings match the
locations of sites 41CS288 and 41CS289.

These documents give evidence that a structure was present on the site at least by 1910. The
structure was probably demolished by 1957 when the property was acquired by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers and was definitely gone by 1969. In addition, there is evidence that the site
was actively being used as late as 1954.

On the basis of the historic documents and the concrete cellar feature, the site is interpreted as
the remains of an early to mid-twentieth century farmstead. Similar twentieth century
homesteads are common in the region. The site appears to lack significant archeological content
and it is unlikely that it offers further research potential.

However, pending further

documentation, the site is assessed as of unknown NRHP eligibility. It should be avoided until
such time as a clear determination of eligibility can be made.

4.3 SITE 41CS289
Site 41CS289 is also a newly discovered historic site. It is located about 350 m west of 41CS288
and, like that site, it is similarly situated on a hill overlooking Mill Creek. The site is defined on
the basis of one feature and five positive shovel tests (Figure 4).

Feature 1 is a roughly circular depression with sloping sides measuring about 1 m deep and 3 m
in diameter. No concrete, rocks, or other structure are visible, but a large tree has grown in the
center of the depression. The feature is interpreted as the collapsed remains of a subsurface root
cellar or storm cellar associated with a farmstead. No other features were observed on the site,
but the area of the site has been thickly overgrown and it is possible that additional features are
buried beneath the vegetation.

No artifacts were observed in the feature or anywhere on the surface of the site. Nine shovel tests
were dug on this site and five of these were positive, returning a total of 15 historic artifacts
(Table 3). This assemblage included six light aqua window glass shards, one very thin shard of
clear, flat glass, two aqua bottle glass shards, two clear bottle glass shards, three small,
unidentifiable, flat fragments of iron cans, and one historic white ware ceramic shard from a
dinner plate. All but one of the 15 artifacts were recovered from 20-40 cmbs, with the fifteenth
item found in the upper 20 cmbs. None of the artifacts had any markings or were notable in any
way, but the assemblage is wholly consistent with an early twentieth century occupation. None
of the artifacts are suggestive of any earlier occupation.

The location of this site also closely matches that of a structure that is plotted on the 1910 USGS
15â topographic quadrangle (Figure 4). The 1969 USGS topographic map does not show any
structure in this location. The 1949 and 1954 aerial photographs show a maintained clearing in
this location (Figures 5 and 6). The same location is overgrown with vegetation in the 1970
image. The 1954 photograph also reveals the bright image of a dirt road along the southeastern
edge of the clearing, suggesting that the road was actively being used.

A structure was present on the site at least by 1910 and was probably demolished by 1957 when
the property was acquired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was definitely gone by
1969. In addition, there is evidence that the site was actively being used as late as 1954.

On the basis of the artifact
assemblage, together with the
historic documents, the site is
interpreted as the remains of an
early to mid-twentieth century
farmstead.

Similar

twentieth

homesteads

are

common in the region. The site

to

5.0 CONCLUSIONS
5.1 SUMMARY OF RESULTS

This cultural resources inventory investigated a 99 acre project area at Lake Wright Patman in
Cass County, Texas. Field methods included a pedestrian inventory accompanied by excavation
of 75 shovel tests. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug to either the
clay horizon or to 80 cm below the surface. Six tests could not be dug due to steep slopes;
overall testing density for the project was 0.7 tests per acre.

The inventory investigated three archaeological sites (Table 4). Two of these were newly
discovered historic sites and one was a previously recorded prehistoric site.

No historic

buildings or structures were present in any of the inventory areas.

5.2 MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
The eligibility of any given archaeological site for inclusion on the NRHP is determined by
evaluating the siteâs potential to contribute meaningfully to future scientific research. Research
potential is assessed by comparing the types of data that are known - or are suspected - to exist at
the site, together with their provenience, context, and integrity, against a set of research questions
that have been previously recognized for similar sites in the region. These research questions are
discussed in the planning document for East Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

None of the sites located within the project area have significant research potential and none of
them are recommended as eligible for inclusion on the NRHP (Table 4). The two farmstead sites
are assessed as of undetermined NRHP eligibility and should be avoided pending a clear
determination of research potential.

41CS59

Fieldwork determined that this site is not located within the current project area. The site is
probably located along the shoreline north of the project area at an unknown distance, but
possibly up to 200 m.

41CS288

This site consists of the remains in poor condition of a twentieth century farmstead. Similar
twentieth century farmsteads are common in the region and it is unlikely that the site offers
significant research value. However, the site is assessed as of uncertain NRHP eligibility and
should be avoided pending a clear determination of research potential and NRHP eligibility.
