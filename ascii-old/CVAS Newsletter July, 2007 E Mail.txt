One, Sloan Dalton, is a six chapter video series on the technique of pressure flaking.
Type “Sloan Dalton” into your browser for
this site. The other, Scalp Creek, has 22 videos covering flint knapping, Texas dart

Friends and colleagues: More than a thousand years ago, the Mayan city of Tikal held sway over
a large region of the Yucatan peninsula of Central America. Some of the city's most splendid
monuments are featured in Tikal: A CyArk Case Study, the latest video feature on our nonprofit
streaming-media Web site, The Archaeology Channel (http://www.archaeologychannel.org).
Tikal,World Heritage Site in Guatemala, exemplifies CyArk, a project of the Kacyra Family
Foundation that is preserving the world's most valued cultural heritage sites in three-dimensional
digital form. Tikal, the largest ancient Mayan city, contains some of the most spectacular Mayan
architecture, but is subject to natural erosion as well as the impacts of massive tourist
traffic. This video shows how CyArk is preserving the site in digital imagery through laserscanning technology and the most accurate 3D models possible today.
This and other programs are available on TAC for your use and enjoyment. We urge you to
support this public service by participating in our Membership
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org/member.html) and Underwriting
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org/sponsor.shtml) programs. Only with your help can we
continue and enhance our nonprofit public-education and visitor-supported programming. We
also welcome new content partners as we reach out to the world community.

MIDSUMMER R&R
Had enough of the heat? Want to see one of the most spectacular wonders of the Chihuahuaian
desert? As a result of the courtesy of the THE NATURE CONSERVANCY, The THE ROCK
ART FOUNDATION has the use of the NC INDEPENDENCE CREEK PRESERVE AND
LODGES for July 26 (Thursday) to July 29 (Sunday). If you have not seen the creek and lake,
you have missed one of the most beautiful spots in the desert. Check out the website:http://
www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/texas/preserves/art9517.html(Or Google:
Nature Conservancy Independence Creek Preserve) We will visit only two or three rock art sites
(one of them will be Meyers Springs) early in the morning on Friday and Saturday to avoid the
heat. The remainder of the day can be spent playing games, fishing, swimming, canoeing, kayaking and snorkeling the lake (The water in the lake is crystal clear). The creek is a fly fisherman's haven. If you want to do some hiking, there is "only 19,000 acres" on the preserve. However, be smart about it and be very careful of the heat.The NC has two very nice lodges with
modern kitchens and provides all of the linens and towels. All of the rooms have private
baths.The RAF will provide a Bar-B-Que on Saturday night and we will plan to eat other meals
together and split the cost.The cost of the trip is $250 per person. Because all of the rooms have
only one queen bed, there will be two persons per room. If you want a private room, you will
have to pay for two people, i.e. $500. You are responsible for getting your own roommate. The
proceeds will go to the RAF, of course.Independence Creek is not often available as it is frequently used by the Nature Conservancy to entertain donors. Don't miss this opportunity!If you
are interested, make reservations NOW by emailing Ken Law at whitehawk05@austin.rr.com.
There is only room for 14, so the spots will go quickly.
