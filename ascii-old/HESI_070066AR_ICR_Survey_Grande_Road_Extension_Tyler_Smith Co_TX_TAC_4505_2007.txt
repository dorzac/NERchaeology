MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The City of Tyler, Texas, is proposing to build an extension of Grande Avenue in
southern Tyler, Smith County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would construct an
approximately 3.2-km- (2.0-mi-) long extension of Grande Avenue within an entirely new
proposed right-of-way (ROW) extending roughly from the intersection of Paluxy Drive and New
Copeland Road eastward across a largely undeveloped rural landscape to State Highway (SH)
110 (also known as Troup Highway). The Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of a linear
corridor measuring approximately 3.2 km (2.0 mi) in length by 40 meters (m) (130 feet [ft]) in
width. The APE encompasses approximately 12.8 hectares (ha) (31.5 acres [ac]).
The proposed Grande Avenue extension project is being sponsored by the City of Tyler,
a political subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas. In addition, the City of Tyler may consult with the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) during project design, construction, and/or ongoing maintenance of
the roadway extension, and the project may therefore additionally fall under the jurisdiction of
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 via the indirect
involvement of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Since the proposed undertaking
represents a publicly sponsored project with the potential for damaging or destroying cultural
resources, the City of Tyler was required to provide for a cultural resource evaluation of the
proposed impact area to meet its legal responsibilities under existing state, and possibly also
federal, guidelines.
To meet its responsibilities under these statutes, the City of Tyler tasked Schaumburg &
Polk, Inc. (SPI), through its archeological subcontractor Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon), to conduct a cultural resource survey of the APE associated with the proposed
project. From May 2 to 4, 2007, Horizon archeologists Reign Clark, Project Archeologist, and
Diamond Kapanday, Archeological Field Technician, under the direction of Jeffrey D. Owens,
Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive survey of the APE to locate any cultural resource
properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed construction project. This survey
was conducted by Horizon under subcontract to SPI and under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 4505.
The APE was traversed by Horizon’s archeologists in 2 parallel transects. The
centerline of the proposed Grande Avenue route had not been staked prior to the archeological

survey, so the survey crew navigated via hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) devices.
The modern ground surface was thoroughly inspected for historic and prehistoric cultural
resources; however, due to heavy vegetation cover, ground surface visibility was typically less
than 30%.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) for cultural
resource surveys state that, for linear surveys, a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile, or
10 shovel tests per kilometer, be excavated within a ROW corridor measuring 30 m (100 ft) in
width. The shovel testing density may be increased in areas with higher probabilities to contain
cultural resources, such as stream terraces, and decreased in areas with low probabilities for
cultural resources, such as heavily disturbed areas or upland settings with minimal soil cover.
For the current project, a minimum of 42 shovel tests would be required in the approximately
3.2-km- (2.0-mi-) long by 40-m- (130-ft-) wide survey corridor. Horizon excavated a total of
42 shovel tests within the APE, thereby meeting the TSMASS requirements.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 m [3.3 ft] below surface). The project area is located in
an upland setting well away from Holocene-age alluvial terrace deposits. While surface and
near-surface sediments in the project area consist of relatively deep deposits of sand and sandy
to clayey loam sediments, these upland sediments formed in situ from clayey shale laid down
during the late Eocene. In addition, dense concentrations of ironstone concretions were
encountered toward the bottoms of many shovel tests. As such, the potential for deeply buried,
intact archeological deposits within the APE is substantially lower than in comparable
environments located closer to major area streams. Shovel testing is therefore considered to
constitute an adequate survey technique for identifying cultural resources within the APE.
Stream crossings within the APE are relatively ephemeral and consist of areas near the
headwaters of the streams. One of the 3 stream crossings had been extensively modified via
damming to construct a stock pond, 1 of the streams is little more than a divot in the landscape,
and the third stream (Hill Creek) is characterized by a narrow, deeply incised channel that is
actively cutting into local upland sediments. No Holocene alluvial sediments were observed
anywhere within the APE, and no settings conducive to preservation of deeply buried cultural
deposits were identified in the project area. In addition, the local water table was encountered
in some shovel tests as shallow as ca. 75 centimeters below surface (cmbs), and backhoe
trenching would not, for the most part, have been more effective than shovel testing due to the
proximity of saturated subsurface soils to the surface. As a result, mechanical trenching was
not employed as a site prospecting technique.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken and a photographic
log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and
non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same

location in which they were found. As no cultural resources were observed during the survey,
the collections policy was not brought into play.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations of the Grande Avenue extension
project area documented in this report, no potentially significant cultural resources would be
affected by the proposed undertaking. No new cultural resources were identified in the
remainder of the project area as a result of intensive survey activities, and no previously
documented cultural resources are present in the vicinity of the project area that would be
adversely affected by the proposed undertaking.
In accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, Horizon has made a
reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the APE. As no cultural
resources were identified that meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR
60.4 or for designation as SALs according to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26.12, no
further archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. It is
recommended that the proposed project be cleared to proceed. However, in the unlikely event
that any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed
areas, all work should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should
be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The City of Tyler, Texas, is proposing to build an extension of Grande Avenue in
southern Tyler, Smith County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed undertaking would construct an
approximately 3.2-km- (2.0-mi-) long extension of Grande Avenue within an entirely new
proposed right-of-way (ROW) extending roughly from the intersection of Paluxy Drive and New
Copeland Road eastward across a largely undeveloped rural landscape to State Highway (SH)
110 (also known as Troup Highway). The Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of a linear
corridor measuring approximately 3.2 km (2.0 mi) in length by 40 meters (m) (130 feet [ft]) in
width. The APE encompasses approximately 12.8 hectares (ha) (31.5 acres [ac]).
The proposed Grande Avenue extension project is being sponsored by the City of Tyler,
a political subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977 [revised 1987], Title 9,
Chapter 191, VACS, Art. 6145-9). In addition, the City of Tyler may consult with the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) during project design, construction, and/or ongoing
maintenance of the roadway extension, and the project may therefore additionally fall under the
jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (P.L. 89665; 80 Stat. 915; 16 USC §470 et seq.) via the indirect involvement of the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA). Since the proposed undertaking represents a publicly sponsored
project with the potential for damaging or destroying cultural resources, the City of Tyler was
required to provide for a cultural resource evaluation of the proposed impact area to meet its
legal responsibilities under existing state, and possibly also federal, guidelines.
To meet its responsibilities under these statutes, the City of Tyler tasked Schaumburg &

Diamond Kapanday, Archeological Field Technician, under the direction of Jeffrey D. Owens,
Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive survey of the APE to locate any cultural resource
properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed construction project. This survey
was conducted by Horizon under subcontract to SPI and under Texas Antiquities Permit

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed Grande Avenue extension project area is located in southern Tyler, Smith
County, Texas, and lies within the Gulf Coastal Plains physiographic region (Fenneman
1938:605-630). Environmentally, the Gulf Coastal Plain is characterized as:
an area where the temperate southeastern woodlands gradually give way to the
grasslands of the plains. It is a land of mixed forests, pine barrens, open savannas, tall
grass prairies, and littoral marshes. Much of the terrain is gently rolling but mountains
(the Ouachitas) and costal flats are to be found in the northern and southern margins of
the region, respectively. A number of perennial rivers and streams cross the area,
ending in the deltas and bays along the…Gulf of Mexico (Story and Guy 1990:2).

Northeastern Texas supports three major physiographic communities— the Blackland
Prairie, the Post Oak Savanna (or Oak Woodlands), and the Pineywoods (Diamond et al. 1987).
The Blackland Prairie is a narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards Plateau to
the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east. This area consists of low, rolling land that
extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River
Valley in Northeast Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low
topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams
flow at very gentle gradients. The Blackland Prairie supports a tall-grass community that
commonly includes such species as little bluestem, yellow Indian grass, big bluestem,
switchgrass, and various forbs (Diamond et al. 1987:209, 211). The distribution of the tall-grass
prairie is closely related to patterns of rainfall and soil character, as the prairie tends to occur in
areas that receive less than 40 inches of rain annually and that have clayey, calcareous soils
(Collins and Bousman 1990:29).
The Post Oak Savanna and Pineywoods support medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous
forests, and shortleaf loblolly pines are common in the Pineywoods on upland fine sandy loam
soils with adequate moisture. Small areas of tall-grass prairie may occur in both communities
(cf. Jordan 1981). The Post Oak Savanna is a narrow, southwest-to-northeast-trending
woodland belt that marks a natural transition zone, or ecotone, between the more xeric
Blackland Prairie to the west and the more mesic Pineywoods to the east (Kuchler 1964). The

HJN 070066 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Post Oak Savanna is composed primarily of post oak, blackjack oak, hickory, pecan, and ash
(Kuchler 1964).
The proposed Grande Avenue extension project area is situated within the Pineywoods,
the dominant vegetation region of Northeast Texas. The Pineywoods region is composed of
2 distinct forest communities—mixed pine-hardwood forest and longleaf pine forest. The mixed
pine-hardwood forest, the specific vegetation region within which the project area is located, is
characterized by medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous hardwoods, including a wide variety of
oak, elm, hickory, maple, sweetgum, and other mesic species. In some cases, the presence of
pine represents a subclimax vegetation association. The longleaf pine forest is most common in
the southern part of Northeast Texas, extending south to the coastal prairies of Southeast
Texas. Longleaf, shortleaf, and loblolly pines, as well as a variety of hardwoods such as oak,
hickory, beech, birch, gum, and magnolia, as well as tupelo and bald cypress in swampy
floodplain areas, are constituents of this vegetation region. Within both Pineywoods vegetation
communities, bottomland forests and wetlands are common.
These communities are
dominated by hardwood and swamp forests, marsh and bog vegetation, herbs, shrubs, and
other plants that tolerate extended periods of stream overflow. Common trees in these habitats
are sweetgum, black tupelo, elm, green ash, bald cypress, water oak, overcup oak, cottonwood,
black willow, and American hornbeam (Diamond et al. 1987:212). Herbs, shrubs, ferns, cane,
wax myrtle, sassafras, holly, yaupon, cane, and buttonbush occur along the margins of
marshes, bogs, and channel lakes and sloughs.
As a result of moderately high rainfall and extensive aquifers, perennial rivers and
streams are common across most of the Gulf Coastal Plain (Story 1990:8-9). With the
exception of some small coastal streams, 6 major river basins occur in this region—the Brazos,
Neches, Red, Sabine, San Jacinto, and Trinity—all of which flow in a more or less southeasterly
direction and discharge into the Gulf of Mexico. Under current climatic conditions, all of the
larger rivers are reliable sources of surface water, though smaller streams are more variable.
The most dependable are those that receive groundwater discharge and delayed runoff
(Thurmond 1981:29-36). The least reliable are those fed solely by direct runoff. Two other
sources of surface water, lakes and springs, also occur in the area. With the exception of
Caddo Lake (a natural, albeit artificially enlarged, impoundment) on the Cypress River and lakes
on the Red and lower Brazos floodplains, most lakes in the region occur on smaller streams, are
dry at least part of the year, and have minimal subsistence value. Springs are fairly numerous
in the region, and even high-order streams in the region often have sustained water flow
because they are fed by groundwater discharge and aquifers (Story 1990:8-9). Changing land
use practices, farming, and erosion have caused many springs to dry up over the last 150 years
or to have a much reduced flow (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:38).
Smith County is extensively dissected by creeks and rivers. The 3 main drainages—the
Neches River on the west, the Sabine River on the north, and West Mud Creek in the southcentral area south of Tyler—have broad, poorly drained floodplains. The Grande Avenue
extension project area, located in southern Tyler, Texas, is situated on a broad upland divide
between the Sabine and Neches-Angelina river systems. Creeks draining this upland area flow

New Copeland Road to SH 110, Tyler, Smith County, Texas

northward to the Sabine River, southward toward West Mud Creek, and eastward into a series
of secondary streams that conjoin to form the Angelina River farther south in Cherokee County.
Specifically, the project area is located toward the southern edge of the upland divide
between the Sabine and Neches-Angelina river systems, and 3 minor streams flow southward
across the east-to-west-oriented APE. The largest of these 3 streams, Hill Creek, crosses the
APE near its eastern terminus between Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 2964 (also known as
Rhones Quarter Road) and SH 110. The headwaters of Hill Creek are located only 1.0 km
(0.6 mi) north of the point at which the stream crosses the APE, and the segment of Hill Creek
within the project area flows through a narrow channel that is actively incising into surrounding
upland formations. The remaining 2 stream crossings are located at the headwaters of
unnamed tributaries. The western unnamed stream is situated in the western half of the APE
approximately midway between Paluxy Drive and FM 2964. This stream flows southwestward
to discharge into Shackleford Creek, though the stream crossing within the APE amounts to little
more than a broad divot in the landscape that did not contain any water at the time of the survey
despite recent heavy rains. The eastern unnamed stream is a tributary of Hill Creek and has its
headwaters at a stock pond that has been constructed immediately south of the APE just east of
FM 2964. The construction of this stock pond has resulted in extensive impacts to the native
landscape in this portion of the APE, and little remains of the natural channel of this intermittent
stream.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The project area is situated within the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Sedimentary bedrock formations of limestone and sandstone
laid down during the Cretaceous Period parallel the margins of the ancient, receding coastline of
the Gulf of Mexico and crop out as cuestas or escarpments across the generally southwardly
dip of the modern land surface (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Little internal relief over 50 m
occurs except along the eroded fronts of the cuestas and in the ironstone hills (Fisher 1965;
Godfrey et al. 1973).
Soils in Northeast Texas are divided into 2 broad groups—upland soils and alluvial
valley soils (Godfrey et al. 1973). Upland soils support tall grasses and hardwoods and tend to
form directly on bedrock, except where colluvial deposition has occurred during the Quaternary
Period. These soils vary from moist, acidic soils with a sandy to loamy surface horizon and
clayey subsoil to soils whose basic loamy surface horizons overlie clay-enriched B-horizons.
Bone and shell preservation is common in archeological deposits in the latter soils (Story
1990:9). Mixed hardwood and pine forests occur on the acidic upland soils in Northeast Texas.
Tall-grass prairie occurs on the dark, clayey soils of the Blackland Prairie to the west of the
project area (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993).
As a region, Northeast Texas exhibits relatively little topographic relief. The bedrock is
exclusively sedimentary and is not very resistant to erosion. Drainage is well developed,
including major river systems that arise both outside of the region (i.e., Red and Trinity) as well
as within it (i.e., Angelina, Attoyac, Cypress, Neches, Sabine, and Sulphur). Much of Northeast
Texas is dominated by fluvial transport systems in which streams tend to meander within their

HJN 070066 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

valleys, locally cutting into the outer banks of bends and depositing sediment packages against
the inner banks of bends (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Valley soils are important
archeologically because they often contain stratified cultural deposits, usually in association with
buried, cumulic soils. Point bars, levees, and flood basins are distinctive geomorphic features
that share the common attribute of active aggradation. In theory, archeological sites may be
expected to form in such landforms and, depending on the rate of sedimentation and human
occupation, may develop internal stratification. To date, however, most archeological surveys
conducted along streams in Northeast Texas have documented almost no sites on levees or
point bars (Hsu 1969; Anderson et al. 1974; Bruseth et al. 1977). The low density of recorded
archeological sites in such areas likely results from the low site visibility and difficult survey
conditions. In the Angelina and Neches drainages, bottomlands support a diverse hardwood
and swamp forest with natural levees, point bar deposits, old stream channels, oxbow lakes,
and backwater swamps. The low number of archeological sites recorded in these drainages is
almost certainly a function of the difficulty of surveying floodplain environments partially covered
by impenetrable swamps (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993; Perttula 2004:370).
Natural lakes, ponds, and swamps are also common features of Northeast Texas
floodplains, and they typically represent sections of abandoned channels of rivers and streams
that have not been filled by alluvial deposits (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Lakes generally
contain some open water, marshes are heavily vegetated (usually with grasses) but do not form
peat, and bogs are waterlogged and spongy areas in which mosses and other decaying
vegetation produce an acidic environment conducive to peat development. Lakes, ponds, and
marshes in Northeast Texas are generally of fresh water and form aerobic, basic
environments—they may contain excellent stratigraphic records and preserved bone, though
they are not conducive to botanical preservation. Bogs, on the other hand, are anaerobic,
acidic, and may have remained permanently saturated over long periods of time. Such
environments are optimal for the preservation of normally perishable artifacts (Chelf 1946) as
well as the entire spectrum of natural organic remains (Bryant 1989). Bog material is suitable
for direct radiocarbon dating, and the 2 pollen cores upon which much of the palynological
record of Northeast Texas is based were obtained from the Boriack and Weakly bogs in Lee
and Leon counties, respectively (Bryant 1969, 1977; Holloway and Bryant 1984; Holloway et al.
1987).
Valley margins in Northeast Texas streams include colluvial slopes and occasional
alluvial fans. Such geomorphic features represent areas of natural deposition that may be well
suited to some kinds of human activity, a combination favoring the formation of stratified
archeological sites (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). The lower reaches of such features afford
high ground adjacent to flood basin resources, and archeologists commonly find sites in these
settings in Northeast Texas.
Aeolian landscape features pose a somewhat more complicated scenario in Northeast
Texas (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). These are extensive surficial sand deposits that are
subject to modification by wind at any time that vegetative cover is disrupted. Some indications
of aeolian modification of sand deposits have been noted in and near the region (e.g., Gunn and
Brown 1982; Mandel 1987; Perttula et al. 1986), but the validity of some of these interpretations,

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 2.0 Miles of the Proposed Grande Avenue Extension Project,

the possible extent of Quaternary aeolian-modified landscapes, and the timing of any increased
aeolian activity are in question.
The project area is underlain by the late Eocene-age Sparta Sand geological formation
(Flawn 1975). The Sparta Sand formation consists of light gray to brownish-gray, fine- to
medium-grained quartz sand with a cohesive silt and clay matrix with a massive structure.
Local cross-beds and interbeds of sandy clay occur in the upper portions of the formation, and
the sandy matrix of this geological unit weathers to various shades of light gray upwards. The
formation averages approximately 52 m (170 ft) in thickness and is underlain by hard, brown,
ferruginous sandstone.
The project area is situated on the Wolfden-Pickton Association, which consists of gently
sloping to moderately steep, well-drained, sandy soils with loamy subsoil that formed under
predominantly hardwood forests on uplands (Hatherly 1993). Specifically, the project area
traverses 4 distinct soil units—Freestone fine sandy loam, 1 to 3% slopes (FrB); Pickton loamy
fine sand, 1 to 6% slopes (PkC); Wolfpen loamy fine sand, 1 to 6% slopes (WoC); and Wolfpen
loamy fine sand, 8 to 15% slopes (WoE). These 4 soil units consist of numerous small areas
that form alternating bands that each collectively cover approximately equal proportions of the
APE. These soil units consist of various friable sand and sandy to clayey loam sediments
overlying mottled grayish and reddish clay and Eocene sand subsoils at depths ranging from
127 to 203 centimeters (cm) (50 to 80 inches) below surface (cmbs). While cultural resources
are commonly encountered in deep sandy sediments in Northeast Texas, especially in and
adjacent to major streams, the relative antiquity of the sandy mantle in upland areas, such as
the current project area, suggests that any cultural resources would be contained within the
upper stratigraphic zones overlying the native clayey and sandy subsoils.

2.3

CLIMATE

The environment in Northeast Texas has not remained the same throughout the ca.
12,000 years during which humans have lived in the region. Archeological, faunal, geological,
and pollen evidence suggest that significant changes have occurred, and these changes have
major implications for the development and maintenance of human adaptive strategies in the
region (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). At present, these changes are poorly understood as only
limited evidence of past environments prior to ca. 3,000 years ago has been obtained (Bryant
and Holloway 1985; Collins and Bousman 1990; Story 1990).
Evidence for climatic change from the late Pleistocene to the present is most often
obtained through studies of pollen sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985). Few pollen studies
have been conducted in Northeast Texas—to date, only a few studies from Buck Creek Marsh
and Jewett Mine have provided interpretable pollen data from this portion of the state (Jacobs
1991; Scott-Cummings 1991), but these are poorly dated or have serious gaps in their records.
Nevertheless, an important series of pollen sites occur in areas surrounding Northeast Texas
(cf. Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). The best dated and most informative pollen sequences come
from Boriack Bog in Lee County and Weakly Bog in Leon County (Bryant 1969, 1977; Holloway
and Bryant 1984; Holloway et al. 1987). The radiocarbon dates from Boriack Bog suggest a
regular accumulation of deposits and indicate that Boriack Bog surface sediments are

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

approximately 3,000 years old. Bryant (1977) indicates that the bog was drained and the
surface peat was excavated in the 20th century; thus, the surface of the peat was lowered to
sediments of that age. Weakly Bog, by contrast, covers the last 3,000 years or so, and the
bottom samples roughly match the younger portion of Boriack Bog. Thus, Boriack and Weakly
bogs cumulatively provide a general picture of vegetation change throughout most of the late
Pleistocene and Holocene periods for this region of Texas.
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for East Texas that
includes 3 separate climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.),
the Late Glacial Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to
present). Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. The limited available evidence suggests
that the region was more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods and
that, prior to ca. 10,000 years B.P., it was forested with species that prefer cool, temperate
conditions, including boreal taxa such as spruce (Bryant and Holloway 1985). This late
Pleistocene/early Holocene climate is inferred to have been cooler than today, with increased
precipitation and/or more effective moisture, but with perhaps less seasonal climatic constraints.
The Late Glacial Period was characterized by a slow warming and/or drying trend (Collins 2004)
during which the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak
savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial Period, the environment appears to have been more stable.
During the early Holocene (ca. 10,000 to 7000 B.P.), warmer temperatures prevailed, with less
moisture and presumably a lower density of forest cover. The deciduous forests were replaced
by prairies and post oak savannas. Collins and Bousman (1990) suggest that significant
expanses of grassland were present along the western edge of the Northeast Texas region.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. In the middle Holocene, the period between
ca. 7000 and 4000 B.P., much drier and warmer conditions may have characterized the region’s
climate, possibly resulting in even more widespread grasslands and replacement of forests
along its western edge. The forest cover in Northeast Texas is suspected to have been at its
lowest density during this time period (Collins and Bousman 1990:62).
Following the warm and dry interlude of the middle Holocene, environmental data
suggest that a gradual reforestation of the region continued into the late Holocene (ca.
4000 B.P. to present). Collins and Bousman (1990) suggest that prairie areas were replaced
first by oak savanna, then by oak-hickory forest in the western part of the region and by oakhickory-pine forest in the eastern portions of the region. Bryant and Holloway (1985) suggest
that essentially modern environmental conditions in Northeast Texas were probably achieved by
about 1,500 years ago.
Stable carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen isotope analyses are becoming
increasingly important sources of information about past climatic conditions and changes. A
14,000-year stable isotopic record from the Aubrey Site in the Trinity River Basin in NorthCentral Texas documents changing climatic conditions with wetter (and perhaps slightly cooler)
8

or more humid climates from ca. 11,000 to 7500 B.P., again between 4000 and 2000 B.P., and
yet again after 1,000 years ago (Humphrey and Ferring 1994; Perttula 2004:371). Conversely,
the Aubrey Site record suggests periods of warmer-than-present climate between 7,500 and
4,000 years ago and between about 2,000 and 1,000 years ago. Interestingly, fossil vertebrate,
pollen, and stable isotope data from Central Texas and the Edwards Plateau tell a somewhat
different story, highlighting 2 dry climatic peaks between ca. 7000 and 3000/2500 B.P. and after
1,000 years ago (Toomey et al. 1993; Perttula 2004:371). The timing and nature of such
climatic changes have major implications regarding the relative position of the prairie-forest
border, the possible presence or absence of bison, and the natural resource potential of the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna.
The modern climate of the region is characterized as humid subtropical, with warm,
humid weather from the spring to the fall, and cool, humid weather in the fall and winter. The
climate is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is
modified by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring,
summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental
climate characterized by considerable variations in temperature. Summers are long and warm.
Winters are short and mild and are characterized by short periods of clear, cold, or freezing
weather interspersed with cloudy and rainy periods and clear, pleasant days. Extremely hot or
cold temperatures are rare. Sudden temperature changes are not very common during
summer, but may occur frequently in winter. Rapid drops in winter temperature are caused by
cold waves or sudden, strong north winds, though freezing weather is uncommon. Average
winter temperatures range between 35 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and average summer
temperatures range from 85 to 95°F. Valleys and low divides are often covered with frost on
early winter mornings, but freezing temperatures are of short duration. The average frost-free
season is 246 days (March 15 to November 16) (Bomar 1983; Mowery 1948:3-5).
The region is well watered—precipitation falls rather uniformly over the area and is fairly
well distributed throughout the year. Normally, it is heaviest in December, March, April, and
May, and lowest in August. Rainfall varies from year to year, but the average is about
45 inches. Torrential rains fall occasionally, especially in winter and spring, and light snows fall
occasionally in winter but melt rapidly. Hailstorms are infrequent but do occur in the vicinity of
the project area (Mowery 1948:3-5). Precipitation generally increases from north to south
across the region and decreases from east to west in a clinal pattern. The wettest counties in
the area (Shelby, Sabine, and San Augustine) receive more than 48 inches of annual
precipitation, while the driest counties (Fannin, Henderson, and Anderson) receive between
36 and 40 inches of precipitation each year. Droughts are not uncommon, and periods of lower
summer precipitation are often accompanied by extended droughts caused by warm continental
Pacific air masses moving across the area from the west.
Dendrochronological analyses of tree rings suggest that numerous wet and dry spells
occurred during the last 1,000 years (Stahle and Cleaveland 1994, 1995). Dry conditions and
the worst droughts occurred in the late A.D. 1200s, in the mid-1400s and 1600s, and then again
in the mid-1700s (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995). Stahle et al. (1985) suggest that the worst
June drought to occur in the past 450 years occurred during the period between A.D. 1549 and

HJN 070066 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

1577. More favorable conditions probably occurred during the intervening years, especially
between ca. A.D. 1390 and 1440, then in the late part of the 16th and early 17th centuries
(Perttula 2004:371). Such climatic perturbations presumably affected the predictability and
success of maize harvests during the Caddoan occupation of the Pineywoods and neighboring
Post Oak Savanna (Perttula 2004:371). Similar fluctuations throughout the Holocene would
also have affected the range, distribution, and abundance of naturally occurring plants and
animals upon which non-agricultural human populations relied.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Northeast Texas Archeological Region is situated within the Austroriparian biotic
province (Blair 1950). This province includes the Gulf Coastal Plain from the Atlantic Ocean to
eastern Texas, and its western boundary, which is approximated by a line running north from
western Harris County to western Red River County (Dice 1943), is the western boundary of the
main body of pine and hardwood forests of the eastern Gulf Coastal Plain. In Texas,
Austroriparian vegetation consists of 2 vegetation regions, the long-leaf pine and pine-oak forest
regions. The project area is situated in a forested upland environment within the mixed pinehardwood forest section of the pineywoods vegetation region.
Forested uplands within the project area generally consist of a mix of hardwood and pine
stands with dense understories composed of trees, shrubs, and vines. These areas are
typically dominated by water oak (Quercus nigra), post oak (Quercus stellata), southern red oak
(Quercus falcata), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), sweet gum
(Liquidambar styraciflua), winged elm (Ulmus alata), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana),
common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), and
blackberry (Rhubus sp.). Upland shrubland consists of small tree species such as various elms,
various oaks, sweet gum, and pine, as well as a variety of shrub species such as eastern falsewillow, sumac (Rhus sp.), Mexican plum (Prunus mexicana), and rusty black-haw (Viburnum
rufidulum). Upland grasslands are dominated by Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), nettles
(Solanum spp.), and yankeeweed (Eupatorium compositifolium).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Northeast Texas Archeological Region, a
subdivision of the THC’s Eastern Planning Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). The cultural
history of Northeast Texas can be subdivided into 9 broad temporal periods, although the
historic period has been differentiated into overlapping Historic Caddoan and Historic
EuroAmerican periods to distinguish between the highly divergent historical experiences of the
indigenous Native Americans and EuroAmerican settlers during the settlement of Texas
(Table 1).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9500 TO 7000 B.C.)

The initial human occupation of the New World can be confidently extended back before
10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Lynch 1990; Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft
Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans were present in Eastern North America as
early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al. 1990), while more recent discoveries at
Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for human occupation in South America by
at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer et al. 1997). Most archeologists
presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation in North America during the
Pleistocene glacial period.
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Northeast Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (ca. 9500 to 7000 B.C.) (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This period
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred endscrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns are known primarily
through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of small animals,
fish, and shellfish during the PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in Northeast Texas for
hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in North America; rather, a
broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced until the Late Prehistoric
period.
The distribution of PaleoIndian artifacts within the region suggests that these early
aboriginal occupations were principally situated within the valleys of major stream basins
(Anderson 1996; Thurmond 1990; Perttula 2004:373) as well as in resource-rich areas like the
Ouachita Mountains escarpment to the north (Anderson 1996). Anderson (1996) hypothesizes
that the initial and most intensive PaleoIndian settlement of the Southeast (including Northeast
Texas) occurred in the resource-rich valleys of the Mississippi River and its principal tributaries.
From there, PaleoIndian groups spread throughout the wooded Southeast and East, with
concentrations at 250- to 400-km (155- to 249-mi) intervals. The relatively sparse PaleoIndian
archeological record, combined with the dispersion of artifacts across many different landforms
and physiographic settings, seems to indicate that PaleoIndian groups were highly mobile,
generalized hunters and gatherers rather than specialized hunters of extinct megafauna (Fields
and Tomka 1993), as has been inferred for PaleoIndian populations on the Great Plains.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 7000 TO 200 B.C.)

Throughout most of North America, the onset of the hypothesized Hypsithermal drying
trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period (ca. 7000 to 200 B.P.) (Perttula and Kenmotsu
1993). In many regions, this climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation of
lifestyle—the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the big game
populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base composed of
smaller game and wild plants. In Northeast Texas, however, a generalized hunting and
gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory prior to the advent of large-scale
agricultural systems during the Late Prehistoric.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture have been noted as well. Johnson
(1962) employs archeological data from the Yarbrough site (41VN6) on the upper Sabine River
to bring chronological order to the diverse Archaic archeological record in Northeast Texas.
Johnson’s (1962) temporal divisions are based on projectile point sequences and on the
introduction of plain ceramics at the end of the Archaic period. More recent refinements of the
projectile point sequence (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990) document straight and expanding-stem

12

forms characteristic of the Early and Middle Archaic subperiods and contracting-stem darts
during the Late Archaic and subsequent Early Ceramic periods (Schambach 1982, 1998).

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (CA. 200 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The Early Ceramic period (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800), also known as the Woodland
period, is characterized in much of Northeast Texas, especially from the Sabine to the Red
rivers, primarily by plain, relatively thick ceramic bowls and flowerpot-shaped jars, double-bitted
axe heads, smaller and thinner versions of Gary dart points, and later in the period by cornernotched arrow points (Thurmond 1990). Early Ceramic sites along the Red River in
southwestern Arkansas and in Northeast Texas have abundant ceramics, though many sites of
this age, especially between the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, do not evince such prevalent use of
ceramics (Perttula 2004:376). This situation suggests regional differences in food processing
technologies and/or dietary habits, and may further highlight differences in the degree of
sedentism among populations across the area (Skibo and Blinman 1999). Lower Mississippi
Valley ceramic styles (e.g., Tchefuncte Stamped, Churupa Punctated, Marksville Incised,
Troyville Stamped, and Marksville Stamped) occur with some regularity at sites in the Sabine,
Sulphur, and Big Cypress basins (Story 1990). These ceramics may provide evidence of
contact and interaction between Trans-Mississippi South and Lower Mississippi Valley
populations, or they may represent the adoption of Lower Mississippi Valley stylistic and
decorative attributes by local potters (Perttula and Bruseth 1995; Schambach 1982, 1998).
The Early Ceramic inhabitants of Northeast Texas were still primarily hunter-gatherers,
though they may have lived in increasingly large groups and/or resided for longer periods of
time at certain sites (Perttula 2004:377). Larger villages and multiple mound centers begin to
be constructed during this period on the major streams (e.g., the Red and Sabine rivers). Some
sites have relatively substantial midden deposits, particularly along the Red River and in the
upper Sulphur River basin (Fields et al. 1997; Schambach 1982), and some evidence for
structures (probably daubed pole and thatch structures), but the degree of settlement
permanence is still less than that seen in the subsequent, long-term, Caddoan settlements of
Northeast Texas (Perttula et al. 1993:99).
On the basis of available paleobotanical information, Early Ceramic groups may have
cultivated squash (McGregor 1996) and used native seeds, tubers, and roots in addition to a
variety of woodland and aquatic animal resources (Webb et al. 1969). The presence of chipped
stone axes and hoe-shaped tools in Early Ceramic occupations suggests that some level of
horticultural activity was occurring, though intensive use of colonizing weedy annuals may
similarly account for the presence of these implements. Bruseth (1998) has suggested that
maize was being cultivated during the latter portions of this period, but stable isotope analyses
of some 25 or more Late Archaic, Fourche Maline, and Formative to Early Caddoan human
remains indicate that maize was not a major part of the diet at this time (Rose et al. 1998).
Early Ceramic period burial mounds have been documented in bluff top and alluvial valley
settings on the Red River in northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas (Schambach
1982, 1997; Webb 1984) and on the Angelina, Neches, and Sabine rivers in Northeast Texas
(Story 1990). Mortuary ceremonialism included the interment of costly, non-local raw materials

HJN 070066 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

and artifacts, including chert, copper, and Lower Mississippi Valley ceramic vessels, in the burial
mounds. Evidence of mortuary or ritual practices also occurs in non-mound contexts such as
the Hurricane Hill Site, which contained a small cemetery on a prominent hill, and the Mahaffey
Site on the Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma, which had a large cemetery with flexed
and semiflexed burials without grave goods (Perino and Bennett 1978). In the broadest sense,
the establishment of bounded cemeteries is often interpreted as a correlate of increasing
sedentism in the western Gulf Coastal Plain of Northeast Texas (Perttula 2004:378).

3.4

FORMATIVE, EARLY, AND MIDDLE CADDOAN PERIODS (CA. A.D. 800 TO 1400)

The Caddoan archeological record represents the fluorescence of aboriginal complex
societies in northeastern Texas, northwestern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas, and
southeastern Oklahoma, and generations of archeologists have long been captivated by the
beautifully manufactured ceramics and other material goods, the earthen mounds, the wellpreserved villages and hamlets, and the existence of a paleobotanical record (e.g., Perttula
2004; Swanton 1942). In the Northeast Texas Archeological Region, the timeframe referred to
in many surrounding regions as the Late Prehistoric period is usually subdivided into the
Formative Caddoan (ca. A.D. 800 to 1000), the Early Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1000 to 1200), the
Middle Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400), and the Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680) periods
(Perttula 1993a). European contact with Caddoan groups in Northeast Texas began around ca.
A.D. 1540, but it was sporadic until after ca. A.D. 1680 (Perttula 1992), and the Historic
Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1680 to 1860) therefore covers the period of regular interaction with
Spanish, French, and other EuroAmerican settlers up to the expulsion of the Caddo peoples
from their homelands and forced removal to Indian Territory in 1859. General characteristics of
Caddoan tradition are discussed below.
In general terms, the Caddo were characterized by:
a large population represented by many small settlements scattered within particular
resource areas; a reliance upon horticulture as one of the primary means of subsistence;
differentiated and undifferentiated mound/habitation sites with structurally differentiated
mound classes (producing an apparently hierarchic division of places on the landscape);
differential treatment of the dead reflective of a system of ranking; [and] indications of
long-term cooperation in disposal of the dead by groups represented by some of the
archeological units (Prewitt 1974:76).

Broadly, these basic characteristics of settlement, subsistence, sociopolitical organization, and
mortuary practices are representative of the Caddoan archeological area from ca. A.D. 750 to
1750 and are similar, if not identical, to what constitutes the Mississippian period cultural
traditions of the Mississippi River Valley and Eastern Woodlands of North America (Griffin 1967,
1985; Smith 1990). Despite these similarities, Caddoan archeologists maintain that the
prehistoric and early historic Caddoan tradition developed largely independently of
Mississippian-period chiefdoms elsewhere (Smith 1990).
Formative to Middle Caddoan period groups seem to have been horticulturalists,
cultivating maize and squash along with several kinds of native seeds (Perttula and Bruseth
1983). They also gathered nuts, tubers, and roots and were proficient hunters of deer, fish,

14

070066_arch_survey_report.docx

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 2.0 Miles of the Proposed Grande Avenue Extension Project,

rabbits, raccoon, turkey, squirrel, and turtles. Available paleobotanical and bioarcheological
evidence from Northeast Texas and elsewhere within the Caddoan area, including stable
carbon isotope analyses of human remains (Rose et al. 1998), suggests that Caddoan groups
became dependent primarily upon maize and other domesticated crops only after about
A.D. 1300. By ca. A.D. 1450, maize comprised more than 50% of the diet (Burnett 1990;
Perttula 1996; Rose et al. 1998), though local variation in dependence upon cultivated plants
has been noted (Cliff 1997; Largent et al. 1997; Perttula 1999).
The most distinctive material culture item of the Caddo populations living in Northeast
Texas was the ceramics they made for cooking, storage, and serving needs (Perttula et al.
1995). The variety of styles and forms of ceramics recovered from the region hint at the range,
temporal span, and geographic extent of prehistoric Caddoan groups across the landscape
(Thurmond 1990). Story (1990:246-247, 277-319) suggests that the earliest ceramics in the
region date between ca. 500 and 100 B.C. and are closely related to the ceramics being
produced in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Between the introduction of ceramics in the region
and the emergence of distinctive Caddoan vessel forms and decorative motifs around A.D. 800,
the local plainware traditions seem to have continued relatively unchanged.
Aside from ceramics, Formative to Middle Caddoan period populations in the
Pineywoods possessed a sophisticated technology based on the use of stone, bone, wood,
shell, and other media for the manufacture of tools, clothing, basketry, ornaments, and other
items (Perttula 1992:15). Well-made corner-notched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points
were common, along with siltstone and greenstone celts, perforators and borers, large Gahagan
bifaces, and a variety of more expedient stone tools, such as unifacial flake scraping and cutting
implements (Perttula 2004:386). Long-stemmed Red River (Hoffman 1967) and cigar-shaped
ceramic pipes, as well as ceramic earspools and figurines, were also manufactured by the
Caddo at this time (Newell and Krieger 1949).
Locally available lithic materials were usually employed for the manufacture of stone
tools, but non-local raw materials and finished goods made from these raw materials were also
obtained through trade (Brown 1983; Perttula 1990). The development and maintenance of
long-distance east-to-west and north-to-south trade networks were notable features of
prehistoric Caddoan tradition. Trade items included bison hides and salt; raw materials such as
copper, stone, and marine shell; and finished objects such as pottery vessels and large
ceremonial bifaces (Brown 1983; Creel 1991; Early 1990; Vehik 1988, 1990). Many of the more
exotic trade items, especially marine shell and copper artifacts, were obtained from areas more
than 186 km (300 mi) away from the Caddoan area (Perttula 1992).

3.5

LATE CADDOAN PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1400 TO 1680)

As currently defined, the Late Caddoan period extends from ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680
(Story 1990). Late Caddoan occupation in Northeast Texas was arguably centered on the
Great Bend area of the Red River, where Late Caddoan archeological sites are included in the
contemporaneous Belcher and Texarkana phases (Schambach 1983). Texarkana phase sites
occur on the Red River northwest of Texarkana to the Arkansas-Oklahoma state line, as well on
the lower Sulphur River (Jelks 1961), while Belcher phase sites are distributed from about

HJN 070066 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Fulton, Arkansas, to below Shreveport, Louisiana (Kelley 1997; Schambach 1983; Webb 1959).
The McCurtain phase represents another Late Caddoan archeological complex upstream from
the Texarkana phase (Bruseth 1998). Texarkana and Belcher phase sites include large,
permanent settlements with mounds, cemeteries, hamlets, and farmsteads (Perttula 2004:393).
The mound centers were marked by the construction of earthen mounds used as temples, burial
mounds, and/or ceremonial fire mounds, as during earlier Caddoan periods (Kelley 1998; Webb
1959). These settlements were inhabited by sedentary Caddo agricultural communities with
complex societies led by individuals with high status (Story 1990).
Late Caddoan period settlements in the Pineywoods of Northeast Texas have been
termed rural Caddoan community systems (Perttula 1991) because they were distributed along
secondary streams, were widely dispersed, and consisted of functionally equivalent farmsteads
and hamlets. Small mound centers were being constructed by Titus phase and other Late
Caddoan groups up until ca. A.D. 1500, and possibly later, in Northeast Texas, but they lack
evidence of burial mounds or large platforms; rather, these mounds contain buried, burned
structures (Perttula 2004:398). The larger Caddoan towns were distributed along the major
stream valleys, such as the Red, Ouachita, and Little rivers. These communities were
hierarchically arranged, with civic-ceremonial centers at the “top” surrounded by associated
towns of linear but dispersed farmstead compounds with several structures (such as bark- or
brush-covered shelters and storage platforms) (Schambach 1983:7-8), followed by hamlets,
farmsteads, and specialized processing and/or procurement locales, such as salt-making sites
(Early 1993; Gregory 1980:356-357).
Faunal subsistence remains are known from a few sites in Northeast Texas dating to this
time period but have so far received relatively little attention (Perttula 1993a; Thurmond 1990).
Vertebrate species represented in trash middens include deer, turkey, cottontail rabbit,
jackrabbit, squirrel, beaver, turtle, and fish, though deer and turkey appear to have been the
dominant economic species (Perttula et al. 1982; 1993). In general, subsistence evidence
suggests that Pineywoods Caddo practiced a strongly maize-based economy at this time (Fritz
1990:421, 425). Floral evidence from trash midden deposits suggests that maize (Zea mays)
provided a dietary staple, and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were also an important food source
(Perttula 2004:4005). Nuts and seeds were gathered but appear to have been of lesser
importance than during earlier time periods (Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Perttula et
al. 1982).
By early historic times, the Caddoan nation comprised at least 25 separate groups,
bands, or tribes organized into loosely affiliated kin-based groups referred to by European
observers as the Hasinai, Kadohadacho, and Natchitoches confederacies (Perttula 1992). The
Hasinai groups lived in the Angelina and Neches river valleys in East Texas, the Kadohadacho
groups on the Red River in the Great Bend area, and the Natchitoches groups on the Red River
in the vicinity of the French trading post of Natchitoches established in A.D. 1714.

3.6

HISTORIC CADDOAN PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1519 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico (Weddle 1985). While no

documentary evidence exists for direct contact with Caddoan peoples during these initial forays,
Europeans were already conducting slave raiding and native resettlement projects along the
Texas coast by 1550 (Bolton 1912). From 1528 to 1534, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and
other survivors of the Narváez Florida expedition crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked
along the Texas coast near Galveston Bay (Bandelier 1964). Swanton (1942:29) does not
believe that Cabeza de Vaca actually encountered any Caddoan people during his wanderings,
though his dealings in Native American trade goods between coastal and inland groups suggest
that he might have traveled in the region (Perttula 1992:19). While direct contact between
Cabeza de Vaca and Caddoan peoples cannot be established by historical documentation,
Perttula (1992) argues that diseases such as typhoid and measles carried by the Narváez party
could have been transmitted to Native American groups living elsewhere along the Texas Coast
and then inland to Caddoan groups through aboriginal trade and other contact. Thus, the
Narváez and Cabeza de Vaca exploration may have been an important benchmark for the
initiation of contact between Europeans and Native Americans in the Spanish Borderlands West
(Hester 1989:199; Perttula 1992:19, 1993b), and may have introduced epidemic diseases that
resulted in substantial population declines prior to the inception of more regular contact later in
the 16th century.
In the early 1540s, the Hernando de Soto entrada, led by Luis de Moscoso following the
death of de Soto along the Mississippi River near present-day Memphis, passed into the
Caddoan area, spending several months among the Caddoan groups who lived between the
Ouachita and Trinity rivers (Swanton 1939; Perttula 1992:19). The death of de Soto on the
Mississippi River at the province of Guachoya in the spring of 1542:
freed the survivors from continuing upon the original objectives of the expedition. There
was only one thought shared by all: to escape from the whole dreadful adventure. Under
the leadership of Luis de Moscoso, they officially decided it was hopeless to seek the
sea…in fact, the cavaliers were clearly reluctant to take to boats…and instead
determined to march west in the direction of New Spain (Brain 1985:xlv).

Within what is now recognized as the Caddoan archeological area, Moscoso described
the provinces of Naguatex, Nondacao, and Guasco, for example, as groups that had dense
populations in scattered settlements and abundant reserves of maize (Swanton 1939:258-280).
Perttula’s (1992) examination of Moscoso’s travels suggests that his route passed through
settlements of aboriginal Caddoan groups known archeologically as the Late Mid-Ouachita (or
Social Hill), Belcher, Texarkana, Titus, and Frankston phases. Different versions of Moscoso’s
route have been proposed by various researchers (e.g., Hudson 1986; Perttula 1992; Swanton
1939). The basic import of the de Soto-Moscoso expedition in 1542 is that these explorers
documented and described aspects of Caddoan settlement, subsistence strategies, aboriginal
routes of travel and trade, and social organization that are broadly consistent with inferences
that have made based on the archeological record.
Between 1520 and 1685, various Europeans actually lived in the Caddoan area less
than 1.5 years in total, and it is virtually certain that most Caddoan peoples during this time
never saw a European (Perttula 1992:29). As a result, artifactual evidence of this phase of
European contact is minimal. As Krieger points out:

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

In any one site, something like twenty beads and two bits of iron may be all that can be
found to represent perhaps a century of contact; and this being true, there must be
scores of sites actually occupied during the same ‘historic period’ from which the
archaeologist cannot recover a single European object (in Davis 1961:120).

The second major phase of European contact in the Caddoan historic period began with
the renewed exploration of the Mississippi Valley following the establishment of the Illinois
colony by the French in the 1670s. The Mississippi River, initially explored by Marquette and
Joliet in 1673 to the mouth of the Arkansas River (Delangez 1946), was fully explored to its
mouth by La Salle. Three years later, another expedition directed by La Salle intended to
colonize the area and link the Gulf Coast with the growing French colonies of Illinois and
Canada. For unknown reasons, this expedition missed the mouth of the Mississippi River and
came ashore on the Texas Gulf Coast at Matagorda Bay (Cox 1922; Gilmore 1986). La Salle
made several trips from Fort St. Louis to explore the region and try to find the Mississippi River,
visiting the Hasinai (or Cenis, in the French transcription) in 1686 before turning back with
several horses purchased from the Hasinai. Another effort was made in 1687 by the survivors
of Fort St. Louis; however, La Salle was murdered by several of the men partway through this
trip, and the remaining party decided to stay on with the Hasinai.
The years between 1685 and 1714 were a time of continual French and Spanish
exploration of the Caddoan area. The threat of French settlement in an area the Spanish
considered to be officially under their hegemony spurred serious Spanish efforts to settle and
missionize the country east of New Mexico and the Rio Grande known to them as the “Kingdom
of the Tejas” (Bolton 1912; Perttula 1992:30). At the same time, the French were determined to
take advantage of the La Salle explorations to extend their claims in the region. Shortly
thereafter, English colonies were established along the South Atlantic Coast that wished to
extend trade routes west to Native American groups living on the Mississippi River and the
Texas Gulf Coast (Coker and Watson 1986; Crane 1929; Usner 1989). European political
relationship, trade and religious objectives, and the larger spheres of influence under the control
of the Spanish, French, and British in the developing world economy all played important parts
in the fate of the Caddo between ca. 1685 and 1800 (Braudel 1984:21-85, 387-429; Wallerstein
1974; Wolf 1982:129-231). Trade contacts, rumors of settlement, and exploration by one
government were responded to in kind by others as part of the unstable process of colonization.
The nature and character of sustained European contact has been comprehensively discussed
by many researchers (Bolton 1915, 1987; Cox 1909; Fieldhouse 1966; Galloway 1982; Gibson
1989; Giraud 1957, 1963, 1974a, 1974b; John 1975, 1985; Surrey 1916; Swagerty 1984; Usner
1987; Wade 1989), and only the broad outlines are presented below in the interest of
summarizing the varying European objectives as they impacted the Caddo.
From the 1790s, containment of the expanding US east of the Mississippi River
dominated Spain’s concerns in its Texas and Louisiana colonies, and the allegiance of the
various Indian nations of the Provincias Internas, such as the Caddo, Wichita, and Comanche,
was perceived by the Spanish government as a critical factor in controlling the frontier. The
1790s were a period of growth in the American fur trade, and another major growth period in the
industry occurred from 1800 to 1808 (Clayton 1967). Beaver was the primary fur resource in
the trade from 1790 to 1820. The Kadohadacho and Hasinai participated in the trade from the
18

outset, and their contributions to the fur trade were considered important parts of the Spanish
and Louisiana economies (Ewers 1969:47-48; Flores 1984; Peake 1954:17-18). Following the
purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, the US moved rapidly to explore the boundaries
and character of its new territory, and the federal government emphasized the establishment of
commercial and political relationships with resident aboriginal groups, including Caddoan tribes.
The Freeman and Custis expedition of 1806 on the Red River followed specific guidelines
regarding interaction with the Indians. This expedition was ultimately abandoned due to
interference with the Spanish related to questions about the boundary between Spanish Texas
and the Louisiana Territory. The US initiated a border war with Spain that resulted in the 1806
Neutral Ground Agreement. Possession of the Red River, as well as the territorial allegiance of
the Kadohadacho, remained unresolved (Flores 1984:287).
As Spanish and American trading ventures evolved through the first 2 decades of the
19th century, the actual settlement of the Red River, its tributaries, and the neutral ground
between Louisiana and Texas began in earnest (Strickland 1937; Haggard 1945). By 1818,
nearly 3,000 settlers from the Midwest and upper South had squatted illegally in Caddo country
along the south side of the Red River from the Great Bend to the Kiamichi River (Lottinville
1980:170-172). Anglo-American settlements increased up to and beyond the time of the Texas
Revolution in 1836 (Strickland 1937:64-238). This settlement expansion was also accompanied
by an influx of aboriginal groups from east of the Mississippi River and from the Arkansas River,
including Choctaw, Cherokee, Delaware, Kickapoo, Quapaw, Shawnee, and Koasati groups
(Anderson 1990; Everett 1990; Ewers 1969; Kniffen et al. 1987; Williams 1964). These groups
exchanged hides, corn, pumpkins, and beans at the trading house in Nacogdoches (Swanton
1942:88) as well as with American government traders at the new agency house at the mouth of
the Sulphur River. As the frontier moved west, Caddoan Indians in Louisiana became more
isolated in the Anglo-American community and were under continual pressure from these
settlers and from the immigrant Indians (Swanton 1942:88; Williams 1964). In Texas,
settlement pressures did not impinge on Caddoan lands until after 1830 (Strickland 1937:318355), though Stephen F. Austin viewed the aboriginal populations of Texas as a hindrance to
the security of settlement (Barker 1925).
Following the death of the Caddo chief Dehahuit in 1833, American pressure in
Louisiana on the new Caddo chiefs led to the ceding of Caddo homelands within the limits of the
US on 1 July 1835 (Swanton 1942:89-92). The Caddo relinquished their lands for $80,000,
agreed to move at their own expense within 1 year of the treaty date, and moved to Texas just
prior to the establishment of the Republic of Texas in 1836. The term Caddo Nation came to be
associated with the Cherokee as well as with the Hasinai, Anadarko, and other related tribes of
East Texas, and the Indians became subject to the repressive measures of successive Republic
of Texas administrations (Neighbours 1973, 1975). By the early 1840s, the Caddo Nation was
composed of remnants of the Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and other once-independent Caddoan
tribes, and it had been essentially pushed out of East Texas along with the other groups who
had signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Republic of Texas in 1843 (Strickland
1937:355; Swanton 1942:97). In 1846, the Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and Anadarko lived together
in a village of about 150 houses on the Brazos River near the present City of Waco, Texas;
shortly thereafter, they moved near the Clear Fork of the Brazos to maintain their distance from

Anglo-American frontier communities. From 1846 to 1854, the US government and the Texas
legislature founded the Texas Indian Reservation on the Brazos River (Neighbours 1957, 1973),
but this reservation lasted only until 1859 due to frictions among white settlers, Indian agents,
and the agglomeration of tribal members. Accordingly, in August 1859, the Caddo Nation, then
about 1,050 people in number, was removed to the Indian Territory and the Wichita agency in
western Oklahoma. Since that time, the history of the Caddo peoples is largely similar to the
overall history of the US.

HISTORIC EUROAMERICAN PERIOD (CA. 1519 TO PRESENT)

The first European visitor was a Spanish missionary named José Francisco Calahorra y
Saenz, who traveled through the area in 1765 and mentioned the Neches Saline, saline plains
located in what later became the southwestern corner of Smith County, in his account of the
journey.1 No other European entered the vicinity until 1788, when Pedro Vial and Francisco
Xavier Fragoso, 2 Frenchmen, passed through on a journey from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to
Natchitoches, Louisiana. Late in the 18th century, disease and threats from other native groups
forced the Caddo Indians to move. By 1820, however, the Cherokees, led by Chief Bowl, had
settled at the Neches Saline after being driven from North Texas by hostile tribes. While these
and other Indians occupied the area, the Mexican government issued grants for parcels of land
throughout what would become Smith County, including grants to David G. Burnet in 1826,
Peter Ellis Bean in 1828, and Vicente Filisola in 1831. George W. Bays, who arrived on the
Neches Saline in 1823, became the first non-Indian settler. Though he left after the Fredonian
Rebellion and later returned only briefly, others were moving into the area. Still, unrest
prevented the development of any sizable Anglo-American settlement. In 1836, there were
40 people, 3 trading posts, and a salt works on the Neches Saline; however, after the fall of the
Alamo, the settlers retreated for a while to Lacy's Fort, located nearby in what is now Cherokee
County. Deteriorating relations with the Cherokees retarded settlement of the area until the
Cherokee War of 1839 led to the removal of the tribe.
With the area open to permanent settlement, pioneers began to homestead. Most were
small farmers who came from the South, particularly Alabama and Tennessee. In July 1846,
Smith County was marked off from the Nacogdoches District and named for General James
Smith, a hero of the Texas Revolution and a prominent military figure in the Republic of Texas.
Tyler was designated as the county seat. The county commissioners’ court was elected and
met for the first time before the end of the year. By 1850, the county had reached a population
of 4,292, and Tyler contained several stores and 276 inhabitants. Most trade was carried on in
New Orleans; goods were shipped from there to Shreveport and then transported by ox-drawn
wagons to Tyler by way of the Dallas-Shreveport Road. The 1850 census reported
91,360 acres of farmland, of which 82,434, or 89%, was unimproved. The remaining

and Woldert (1948), as summarized in The Handbook of Texas Online.

8,926 acres was used primarily to keep livestock, particularly hogs, and to grow subsistence
crops. Corn was the staple crop, used for family consumption as well as livestock feed through
the winter. In 1850, 76 farmers reported a cotton crop that produced a total of only 415 bales.
Local residents grew peaches, apples, grapes, blackberries, and vegetables, but mass
production was not feasible because of transportation difficulties.
In the 1850s, the county continued to grow. Alfred W. Ferguson built 5 brick buildings,
the first in the county, in Tyler. More doctors and other settlers arrived and bought town lots and
also settled at such new sites as Starrville, Jamestown, Canton (later renamed Omen), Garden
Valley, Flora, Mount Carmel, and Mount Vernon. Although ferries were built at several stations
along the Sabine and Neches rivers, travel remained treacherous and dependent on good
weather. David Clopton began publishing the first Smith County newspaper, the Tyler
Telegraph, on a weekly basis in 1851. Tyler University, an academy sponsored by the
Cherokee Baptist Association, opened either in 1852 or 1853. In 1857, the men's department
was destroyed by fire but soon reopened under the name Masonic Male Academy. The
women's department became Eastern Texas Female College, also called Tyler Female
Seminary. By 1860, the county population had increased to 13,392, including 4,980 slaves and
2 free blacks. Of these citizens, 1,021 lived in Tyler. Other small towns now included Mount
Sylvan, Winona, and Whitehouse. Though 50% of the residents owned fewer than 5 slaves,
50 families owned more than 20. The census for 1860 reported 82,043 improved acres, while
286,503 remained claimed but unimproved. County farmers had ginned 9,763 bales of cotton,
which they delivered to the Shreveport and Jefferson markets in wagons now made in the
county and drawn by locally grown oxen. The number of hogs, most of them wild, more than
tripled (to 34,003), and, in 10 years, the number of cattle had increased from 3,831 to 14,716.
With a larger population, a slave labor force, and growth in livestock production came general
expansion in the growth of subsistence crops. In 1860, Smith County farmers produced
605,326 bushels of corn, 66,981 of sweet potatoes, and 19,189 of peas and beans. These
crops fed both families and livestock. Development, however, was not limited to agriculture. In
1860, the county had 6 sawmills, 5 gristmills, 3 corn-whiskey distilleries, 17 blacksmith shops,
9 wagonmakers, 3 saddle shops, 5 cabinetmakers, and 31 general stores. The lawyers
included future governors O.M. Roberts and Richard B. Hubbard. Tyler had become a stop on
the routes of 5 stagecoach lines that transported both passengers and mail and had emerged
as an important legal center for the region. Thirty-one common schools, 45 churches, and
5 Masonic lodges were now established in the county.
Politically, Smith County remained Democratic in the 1860 presidential election. In April,
some disillusioned Democrats, loyal to unionist Sam Houston and upset that the states’-rights
faction controlled the party, called a Constitutional Union party convention in Tyler, but only
6 people attended. In August, after fire destroyed downtown Henderson, Smith County
residents, along with others in the vicinity, were extremely fearful of slave insurrections. Tyler
and Starrville organized patrols, but they were never forced to act. As the election approached,
local newspapers urged secession. The great majority of Smith County voters supported John
Breckinridge, the Southern Democratic party candidate, and upon Lincoln’s election they
organized 1 infantry and 2 cavalry units. In January 1861, the county sent Oliver Loftin, Tignal
Jones, George W. Chilton, John C. Robertson, and O.M. Roberts to the state Secession

Convention in Austin, where Roberts served as president and helped lead Texas into the
Confederacy. In June, a unit known locally as the Smith County Cavalry traveled to Dallas to
answer the Confederate call to arms. During the Civil War, Smith County became an important
part of the Confederacy. In the summer of 1862, General Henry E. McCulloch camped at Camp
Clough, 3 miles east of Tyler, while preparing his troops for a march to Little Rock. Camp Ford,
named for Captain John S. (“Rip”) Ford, was established 4 miles northeast of Tyler as a training
post. With the help of local women, army physicians established a post hospital at Planter’s
Hotel. Medicines were prepared for the Confederate Army at the Confederate States Chemical
Laboratory, just east of Tyler at Headache Springs. After the blockade ended the importation of
foreign medical supplies, surgeon W.R. Johnston of Virginia and his staff made medicine and
liniments from native plants, as well as distilling medicinal whiskey. “Kirbyville,” established
near Tyler by Captain John C. Kirby, operated as a transport depot, housing workers who made
wagons, harnesses, caissons, and saddles. A local shoe shop was 1 of only 5 in the TransMississippi Department of the Confederacy. Vegetables and meat, primarily pork, produced by
county farmers were used to feed military personnel. The largest ordnance plant in the TransMississippi, which eventually employed 75 workers, was located in Tyler. By 1863, slaves had
built a stockade at Camp Ford, where prisoners of war were housed. The facility held
6,000 federal troops during the war.
Reconstruction was a difficult time for Smith County. The war had cost the lives of many
of the county’s young men and had brought widespread material loss. Many industries that had
employed local residents and provided business for merchants were discontinued. County
residents grappled with the new economic and social relations between the races. Land values
had decreased from a total of $1,764,661 in 1860 to $961,475 in 1866. The value of county
livestock, which totaled $372,568 before the war, fell to $249,316. After the Reconstruction Acts
were passed, Republicans held local offices for the first time. The majority of these politicians
were long-time local residents. With much of their leadership disenfranchised, Democrats
formed a weak coalition under the leadership of Richard B. Hubbard. The early years of
Reconstruction in the county were characterized by relative calm, though black residents
complained of abuse from whites. In 1867, Tyler became the headquarters of a subdistrict of
the Freedmen’s Bureau, and the bureau’s agents, occasionally supported by small military
garrisons, attempted to secure voting rights, fair labor contracts, and educational opportunities
for the blacks of Smith County and its environs. Race relations rapidly deteriorated as the white
citizens resisted these initiatives. Smith County authorities refused to cooperate with the agency
in enforcing labor contracts violated by white landowners and in investigating the numerous
cases of violence against blacks. By 1868, the Freedmen’s Bureau subcommissioner
complained that a white “reign of terror” characterized the district, and he and several agency
personnel were personally involved in a shootout with local toughs. In June 1868, white citizens
attacked schoolchildren attending the year-old black school in Tyler, forcing temporary
suspension of the school. The bureau closed in 1869, but racial tensions continued to disrupt
the county. Late in 1871 the trial of several whites accused of violence against blacks resulted
in a gunfight in the streets of Tyler between white citizens and black state policemen that left
2 whites dead and several black policemen wounded.

The Republican party remained a large faction in Smith County politics even after
Democrats took back control of the state in 1874. In 1876, local voters elected Democrat
Samuel Tilden over Republican Rutherford B. Hayes, but by a narrow margin of 242 votes.
Local versions of the white primary movement succeeded in disfranchising black voters by the
turn of century; the number of county voters dropped from 6,620 in 1896 to 3,746 8 years later.
The postwar years brought political chaos, but they also brought growth and, eventually,
prosperity. In 1865, Professor J.T. Hand opened Charnwood Institute, a boarding school that
became well known in the state. By 1870, the county population had increased to 16,532.
Early in the decade, a furniture factory employing about 20 workers was constructed at
Mechanicsville, northwest of Tyler. Railroad expansion meant new jobs for unskilled labor and
fresh markets for farm produce. In 1874, a branch of the International-Great Northern (later the
Missouri Pacific) was completed through Tyler to Mineola, and, in 1877, 21 miles of the Tyler
Tap Railroad had been constructed. This road, organized by local citizens, was built by county
labor and financed by state funds and local donations. New towns, including Troup, Bullard,
and Lindale, appeared along these new transportation lines. By 1880, Smith County contained
104 miles of track. Small industries, still few in number, included Taft's Iron (a rolling mill),
Daniel Jones's wagon factory, and the Mechanicsville furniture factory. The production of
cotton, now easily shipped to market by railroad, had boomed from 9,763 bales in 1860 to
45,703 in 1880. Farmers grew more than a million bushels of corn as well as large amounts of
oats. Livestock continued to be an important source of income; the number of sheep and
horses had increased significantly. With the beginning of the 1890s, the population of Tyler
more than tripled, and 28,324 people lived in the county. New industries included a box
manufacturer, a bottling works, and a cigar factory. There were also 2 national banks,
4 sawmills, an ice factory, and 6 canning companies. Texas College, a black Methodist college
primarily for educating schoolteachers, opened in Tyler in 1894. A second black school, Texas
Baptist Academy, opened in Tyler in 1905 and changed its name to Butler College in 1924.
The expansion of farm tenancy during the early decades of the twentieth century was a
sign that county agriculture was becoming increasingly vulnerable. By 1920, 50% of the
county's 6,317 farmers were tenants, and 10 years later, with the advent of the Great
Depression, more than 62% were tenants. Ironically, new highways and refrigerated trucks had
destroyed the livelihood of more than 300 farmers because the demand for Smith County
tomatoes had declined. In 1929, proceeds from the sale of cotton represented four-fifths of the
county income. Each year, Smith County, along with other southern counties, had produced
larger amounts of the crop until overabundance had resulted in a depressed market. As prices
fell lower, farmers produced larger crops to raise their income, but the boll weevil often
destroyed a field before it could be harvested. The number of livestock had also fallen
drastically. The rose industry continued to be profitable, and the first Tyler Rose Festival was
held in 1933. Citizens also faced the possible loss of the railroad. In 1932, the Southern Pacific
purchased controlling interest in the Cotton Belt and decided to move the central offices out of
Tyler. More than 1,000 employees feared for their jobs, and a court trial ensued. Tyler,
however, won the case, and the offices remained there. Later in the decade, the county was
adversely affected by the construction of U.S. Highway 80, which bypassed Smith County and
diverted the Shreveport-Dallas traffic.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Farmers, desperately in need of economic improvement, began to seek solutions to their
problems. The federally funded Duck Creek Soil Erosion Project was established in the Lindale
area to study the effects of erosion and formulate effective methods of control. Landowners
participated by voluntarily testing new procedures on their farms. Workers from a nearby
Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp assisted local residents in practical application. They
constructed schools, dams, fences, and Tyler State Park, and also planted trees and grass.
The camp provided both consumers and labor, and Smith County farmers cooperated with
legislative acts by growing less cotton. The greatest boost to the county economy came in
1931, when Guy V. Lewis completed drilling on the first oil well in Smith County. His well was
part of the original East Texas oilfield; soon, other fields, including Chapel Hill, South Tyler,
Mount Sylvan, and Sand Flat, were being developed. Many oil companies and field developers
established offices in Tyler. Suddenly, land was a valuable commodity. The value of county
farms increased from $15,166,945 in 1930 to $82,351,187 in 1940, though the tenancy rate
remained high (49%).
World War II brought still more prosperity. In 1943, Camp Fannin, an infantry-training
center, was constructed near the site of present-day Owentown. The camp employed
2,500 civilians and also brought army personnel into local towns; prisoners of war were held at
the camp later. There were new markets for local produce, and the extensive system of
railroads made Smith County important in transportation. In 1946, several successful
businessmen established the Tyler Foundation to raise funds to help local entrepreneurs get
started. That same year, rose growers formed the Texas Rose Research Foundation to apply
tested methods to their crops. The oil industry had developed with the war, and, by 1947,
98,367,890 barrels had been produced. In 1949, the Whitehouse Dam impounded Lake Tyler.
Fishing and boating opportunities led to more businesses. As commercial dealings became
more important in the county, farming became secondary. Most landowners grew subsistence
crops, roses, or fruit if they were involved in crop production at all. In 1950, corn output was
down to 59,412 bushels from 536,640 bushels in 1940. Cotton production was down by more
than 50%. The number of livestock, however, had risen considerably, and the number of
chickens increased 24-fold, from 4,748 in 1940 to 114,212 in 1950. As cotton growing became
less prevalent, so did tenant farming and sharecropping. Only 25% of 4,034 farmers declared
themselves tenants in the 1950 census. The rose industry flourished; the county had
2,767 acres of roses in 1957, when 225 of the 294 East Texas producers operated in Smith
County. By 1952, local schools had been consolidated into 18 districts, including one in Gregg
County and one in Van Zandt County. That year, voters supported a Republican presidential
candidate, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Smith County had been solidly Democratic in national
elections up to this time, with the exception of its support for Herbert Hoover in 1928. After
1952, the county continued to support Republican presidential candidates through 1992.
As people moved into the area in the 1960s, Tyler, Lindale, and Bullard became
particularly prosperous. In 1966, the Mud Creek Dam project produced Lake Tyler East, which
has a surface area of 2,530 acres and is connected to Lake Tyler by a small canal; both lakes
are frequented by tourists and retirees. Of the 86,350 county inhabitants in 1969, only 1,479
were farmers. Roses continued to be the most stable and lucrative crop, and the lumber
business employed almost 6,000 people. By 1969, county schools had been consolidated into

8 independent districts in Smith County; 2 Smith County schools belonged to districts in other
counties. Education continued to be important in county development in the 1970s. Though
Butler College closed in 1972, Tyler State College opened the following year with 176 students.
It later moved to a 200-acre wooded tract in southeast Tyler, and, in 1979, became part of the
University of Texas system. Tyler began to emerge as a medical center for the region.
Facilities that included Medical Center Hospital, Mother Francis Hospital, East Texas Chest
Hospital (now the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler), clinics, and doctors'
offices employed more than 3,000 people. Roses remained enormously lucrative as a cash
crop and a tourist attraction, and over 12 million plants were produced in 1975. Brookshire
Grocery Company, Tyler Pipe, General Electric, Kelly-Springfield Tire Company, and Southland
Corporation had also become major employers.

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resource survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record cultural resources occurring within the designated survey area
2. To provide preliminary assessments of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for
designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs)
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
at the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas), the National Park Service’s (NPS’s)
online National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the Texas General Land Office (GLO), and/or the Texas State Historical
Association’s and the General Libraries at The University of Texas at Austin’s Handbook of
Texas Online, as well as a program of intensive survey of the APE. No cultural resources were
documented as a result of this survey, so the second and third of these goals were not pursued.
The rest of this chapter presents the methodological background for the current investigations
and the specific survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating the field survey, Horizon personnel reviewed existing information on file
at the THC and TARL for data on previously recorded cultural resource sites and previous
archeological investigations conducted within a 1.6-km (1.0-mi) radius of the project area.
Based on this archival research, no previously recorded archeological sites have been
documented in the vicinity of the project area, and no prior cultural resource surveys have been
conducted in the immediate vicinity.

4.2

SURVEY METHODS

From May 2 to 4, 2007, Horizon archeologists Reign Clark, Project Archeologist, and
Diamond Kapanday, Archeological Field Technician, under the direction of Jeffrey D. Owens,

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive survey of the APE to locate any cultural resource
properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed construction project. At the time
of the survey, the sky was overcast, thunderstorms threatened, and the area had experienced
recent heavy rains. The majority of the APE is heavily forested, and the proposed alignment of
the Grande Avenue extension parallels a transmission line ROW that was utilized during the
survey to provide access to the thickly vegetated project area. While most of the project area
passes through a mixed pine and hardwood forest that was largely intact, several areas
exhibited prior disturbances. The western terminus of the APE between New Copeland Road
and Paluxy Drive had been cleared, and the landscape had been modified via heavy equipment
operations. Immediately east of FM 2964, an unnamed tributary of Hill Creek had been
dammed to create a stock pond, and resulting landscape modifications had resulted in
extensive impacts to the area surrounding the stock pond. Finally, the eastern terminus of the
project area near SH 110 consisted of an open field traversed by a two-track road. Land
clearing and heavy equipment disturbances had resulted in some existing impacts immediately
adjacent to SH 110. Figures 2 to 8 present representative images of various portions of the
APE.
The APE was traversed by Horizon’s archeologists in 2 parallel transects. The
centerline of the proposed Grande Avenue route had not been staked prior to the archeological
survey, so the survey crew navigated via hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) devices.
The modern ground surface was thoroughly inspected for historic and prehistoric cultural
resources; however, due to heavy vegetation cover, ground surface visibility was typically less
than 30%.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) for cultural
resource surveys state that, for linear surveys, a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile, or
10 shovel tests per kilometer, be excavated within a ROW corridor measuring 30 m (100 ft) in
width. The shovel testing density may be increased in areas with higher probabilities to contain
cultural resources, such as stream terraces, and decreased in areas with low probabilities for
cultural resources, such as heavily disturbed areas or upland settings with minimal soil cover.
For the current project, a minimum of 42 shovel tests would be required in the approximately
3.2-km- (2.0-mi-) long by 40-m- (130-ft-) wide survey corridor. Horizon excavated a total of
42 shovel tests within the APE, thereby meeting the TSMASS requirements (Figure 9).
Appendix A presents the stratigraphy and soil characteristics observed in the 42 shovel tests.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 m [3.3 ft] below surface). The project area is located in
an upland setting well away from Holocene-age alluvial terrace deposits. While surface and
near-surface sediments in the project area consist of relatively deep deposits of sand and sandy
to clayey loam sediments, these upland sediments formed in situ from clayey shale laid down
during the late Eocene. In addition, dense concentrations of ironstone concretions were
encountered toward the bottoms of many shovel tests. As such, the potential for deeply buried,
intact archeological deposits within the APE is substantially lower than in comparable
environments located closer to major area streams. Shovel testing is therefore considered to

constitute an adequate survey technique for identifying cultural resources within the APE.
Stream crossings within the APE are relatively ephemeral and consist of areas near the
headwaters of the streams. One of the 3 stream crossings had been extensively modified via
damming to construct a stock pond, 1 of the streams is little more than a divot in the landscape,
and the third stream (Hill Creek) is characterized by a narrow, deeply incised channel that is
actively cutting into local upland sediments. No Holocene alluvial sediments were observed
anywhere within the APE, and no settings conducive to preservation of deeply buried cultural
deposits were identified in the project area. In addition, the local water table was encountered
in some shovel tests as shallow as ca. 75 cmbs, and backhoe trenching would not, for the most
part, have been more effective than shovel testing due to the proximity of saturated subsurface
soils to the surface. As a result, mechanical trenching was not employed as a site prospecting
technique.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken and a photographic
log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and
non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same
location in which they were found. As no cultural resources were observed during the survey,
the collections policy was not brought into play.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The City of Tyler, Texas, is proposing to build an extension of Grande Avenue in
southern Tyler, Smith County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would construct an
approximately 3.2-km- (2.0-mi-) long extension of Grande Avenue within an entirely new
proposed ROW extending roughly from the intersection of Paluxy Drive and New Copeland
Road eastward across a largely undeveloped rural landscape to SH 110 (also known as Troup
Highway). The APE consists of a linear corridor measuring approximately 3.2 km (2.0 mi) in
length by 40 m (130 ft) in width. The APE encompasses approximately 12.8 ha (31.5 ac).
The proposed Grande Avenue extension project is being sponsored by the City of Tyler,
a political subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas. In addition, the City of Tyler may consult with TxDOT during project
design, construction, and/or ongoing maintenance of the roadway extension, and the project
may therefore additionally fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the NHPA via the indirect
involvement of the FHWA. Since the proposed undertaking represents a publicly sponsored
project with the potential for damaging or destroying cultural resources, the City of Tyler was
required to provide for a cultural resource evaluation of the proposed impact area to meet its
legal responsibilities under existing state, and possibly also federal, guidelines.
To meet its responsibilities under these statutes, the City of Tyler tasked SPI, through its
archeological subcontractor Horizon, to conduct a cultural resource survey of the APE
associated with the proposed project. From May 2 to 4, 2007, Horizon archeologists Reign
Clark, Project Archeologist, and Diamond Kapanday, Archeological Field Technician, under the
direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive survey of the APE
to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed
construction project. The APE was traversed by Horizon’s archeologists in 2 parallel transects
and a total of 42 shovel tests were excavated within the APE, thereby meeting the TSMASS
requirements for a project area of this size.
No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result of
the survey.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination
of whether or not an archeological site possesses the potential to make a contribution to 1 or
more previously defined research questions. Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey
level are rarely sufficient to contribute in a meaningful manner to such research issues. The
objective is rather to determine which archeological sites could be most profitably investigated
further in pursuance of regional, methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore,
adequate information on site function, context, and chronological placement from archeological
and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because
research questions vary as a function of geography and temporal period, determination of the
site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly important
objective during the inventory process.
Ultimately, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a function of
the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Archeological
resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of
archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for determination as SALs.

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

6.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are
located in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any
county, city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are
eligible for designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
structure as an SAL if it (1) is publicly or privately owned and listed on the NRHP and (2) meets
one of the following 6 eligibility criteria:
A. Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history;
B. Is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. Is important to a particular cultural or ethnic group;
D. Is the work of a significant architect, master builder, or craftsman;
E. Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction,
possesses high aesthetic value, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinctions; or
F. Has yielded or may be likely to yield information important to the understanding of
Texas culture or history.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

The APE was traversed by Horizon’s archeologists, the modern ground surface was
thoroughly inspected for cultural resources, and a total of 42 shovel tests were excavated within
the APE, thereby meeting the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this size. No cultural
resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result of the survey.

6.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations of the Grande Avenue extension
project area documented in this report, no potentially significant cultural resources would be
affected by the proposed undertaking. No new cultural resources were identified in the
remainder of the project area as a result of intensive survey activities, and no previously
documented cultural resources are present in the vicinity of the project area that would be
adversely affected by the proposed undertaking.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify historic properties within the APE. As no cultural resources were identified that meet
the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as SALs
according to 13 TAC 26.12, no further archeological work is recommended in connection with
the proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the proposed project be cleared to proceed.
However, in the unlikely event that any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the THC should be
notified of the discovery.
