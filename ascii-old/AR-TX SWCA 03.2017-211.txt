Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed University 11 Pipeline in Reagan County, Texas

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Medallion Pipeline Co., LLC, (Medallion) SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed 3.23-mile-long University 11 Pipeline in
Reagan County, Texas. All work was conducted in support of Medallion’s application for a Texas
Antiquities Code permit to conduct cultural resources investigations prior to the construction of facilities
on land owned by the University Lands division of the University of Texas System. All investigations were
conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the NHPA, the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC’s) standards for such projects, and the Council of Texas Archaeologists Guidelines
for Performance, Curation, and Reports. This report addresses the full 3.23 miles of the proposed pipeline
located on property owned by University Lands in Reagan County, Texas, in compliance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit No. 7994.
The investigations included an archaeological background review and an intensive pedestrian survey
augmented by shovel testing to systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if possible, determine the
significance of any cultural resources located within the proposed project area. Following agency approval,
the cultural resources survey included the entire 3.23 miles of the proposed project route within the
University Lands-owned property.
As a result of the current survey, no sites were newly recorded, no previously recorded sites were revisited,
and one isolated find was identified.
SWCA completed an intensive cultural resources survey within University Lands in Reagan County, Texas.
In compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas, the results of the investigation under Texas Antiquities
Code Permit No. 7994 are provided in this report.
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the anticipated
Permit Review Areas. Based on the results of these investigations and the proposed avoidance measures
recommended, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed action would have NO EFFECT ON HISTORIC
PROPERTIES and recommends that the project be allowed to proceed.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Medallion Pipeline Co., LLC, (Medallion) SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed 3.23-mile-long University 11 Pipeline in
Reagan County, Texas. All work was conducted in support of Medallion’s application for a Texas
Antiquities Code permit to conduct cultural resources investigations prior to the construction of facilities
on land owned by the University Lands division of the University of Texas System. All investigations were
conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the NHPA, the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC’s) standards for such projects, and the Council of Texas Archaeologists Guidelines
for Performance, Curation, and Reports. This report addresses the full 3.23 miles of the proposed pipeline
located on property owned by University Lands in Reagan County, Texas, in compliance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit No. 7994.
The investigations included an archaeological background review, and an intensive pedestrian survey
augmented by shovel testing to systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if possible, determine the
significance of any cultural resources located within the proposed project area. Because the proposed
pipeline area falls within state-owned lands, the entire 3.23-mile area was surveyed, in compliance with the
TAC permit.
J. Eric Gilliland served as Principal Investigator. Christina Nielsen served as project archaeologist.
Fieldwork was completed between April 19 and 21, 2017, by Christina Nielsen and Nicholas Wood. The
report was prepared by Nicholas Wood, under guidance of J. Eric Gilliland. Jayme Fontenot provided
geographic information systems (GIS) support from fieldwork through report production.

Project Description
The University 11 Pipeline will consist of an approximately 3.23-mile-long, 6-inch-diameter pipeline
installed in a 100-foot-wide (approximately 30.5-meter-wide) right-of-way (ROW). The portion of this
proposed ROW which crosses parcels owned by University Lands, and which is the subject of this report,
consists of a 3.23-mile-long segment in Reagan County, Texas. This segment will originate at a Medallionowned facility, run northeast–southwest, and terminate at another Medallion-owned facility (Figure 1).

Project Area
This report includes the survey results for the entire 3.23 linear miles of the proposed pipeline that is located
on lands owned by University Lands.
Based on the results of this investigation, SWCA recommends that the proposed project would have NO
ADVERSE EFFECT on any significant resources within the project area, and further recommends that the
project be allowed to proceed.

CHAPTER 2. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Reagan County is situated within the south-central portion of the High Plains and Plateaus region of West
Texas. The region is relatively level without distinguishing landform features except where streams
intersect or where playas (shallow, undrained basins) catch runoff water (Stephens 2010:11). Elevations
range from approximately 2,500 to 4,500 feet. Elevations of the Edwards Plateau, a subdivision of the High
Plans region, on which the project area is located, range from 850 feet on the east to 4,000 feet at the foot
of the mountains west of the Pecos River (Stephens 2010:11).

Geology
According to Ashworth and Christian (1989:8), the majority of Reagan County consists of one main
geologic system, the Cretaceous system. This system and its various groups are described in detail in Table
1.
Table 1. Geology of Reagan County, Texas
System
Cretaceous

Group

Description

Trinity

The Trinity group consists of buff to gray, fine to medium-grained, cross
bedded, quartz sand and sandstone interbedded with lesser amounts of red,
gray, and purple shale. In some places, a fine gravel may occur at the base.

Fredricksburg

The Fredricksburg group consists of a light gray to yellowish brown,
argillaceous, nodular limestone in the lower part, grading upward into a light
to dark gray limestone and brownish gray dolomite. The Segovia Formation
of the Fredricksburg group consists of light gray, cherty limestone and
brownish gray dolomite, the uppermost beds of which include one or more
thick limestone units that form the flat resistive layer capping many of the
hills.

Washita

The Washita group, represented primarily by the Buda Limestone, occurs in
the southern part of Reagan County where it overlies the Segovia
Formation. The formation consists of thin-bedded, hard, sparry limestone at
the top and microcrystalline limestone at the bottom, separated by yellow
fossiliferous, nodular marl.

Soils
Soils encountered during the survey include the Conger-Reagan association, Reagan loam, Ector soils, and
Angelo silty clay loam. Each soil type is described in detail in Table 2 (Natural Resources Conservation
Service 2017).

Description
The Conger series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a
petrocalcic horizon. They are well-drained soils that are moderately
permeable above and below a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.
They formed in calcareous loamy eolian deposits over alluvium derived
from limestone. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping ridges and
divides on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.
The Reagan series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately or
moderately slowly permeable calcareous soils that formed in alluvium
and/or eolian deposits derived from limestone. These nearly level to gently
sloping soils occur on broad flats, filled valleys, and fans. Slopes range from
0 to 3 percent.

Reagan loam

RaA

The Reagan series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately or
moderately slowly permeable calcareous soils that formed in alluvium
and/or eolian deposits derived from limestone. These nearly level to gently
sloping soils occur on broad flats, filled valleys, and fans. Slopes range from
0 to 3 percent.

Ector soils

ECC

The Ector series consists of very shallow to shallow, well-drained soils that
are moderately permeable above a moderately slowly permeable limestone
bedrock. They formed in calcareous loamy residuum derived from
limestone. These gently sloping to very steep soils occur on ridges on
dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 1 to 60 percent.

Angelo silty clay loam

AnB

The Angelo series consists of deep or very deep, well-drained, moderately
slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium
derived from limestone. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur
on treads of terraces on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 3
percent.

Flora
Flora of the Edwards Plateau region includes live oak (Quercus virginiana), shinnery oak (Quercus
havardii), and red oak (Quercus rubra); juniper (Juniperus spp.) (cedar) breaks occur within the eastern
margin and extend into the southern portion of the Grand Prairie (Stephens 2010:25). A thin cover of such
short grasses as buffalograss (Buchleo dactyloides) and curly-mesquite (Hilaria belangeri) dominates the
western half of the region (Stephens 2010:25). Vegetation primarily consists of fourwing-saltbushcreosotebush scrub, as defined by McMahan et al. (1984), which features mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa),
salt-cedar (Tamarix spp.), creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), tarbush (Flourensia cernua), prickly pear
(Opuntia spp.), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), sacaton (Sporobolus sporobolus), blue grama grass
(Bouteloua gracilis), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), James’ rushpea (Pomaria jamesii),
tabosagrass (Pleuraphis mutica), mesa dropseed (Sporobolus flexuosus), purple threeawn (Aristida
purpurea), and jimmyweed (Isocoma wrightii).

Fauna
Common fauna in this region include black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), desert cottontail
(Sylvilagus audubonii), Merriam’s pocket mouse (Perognathus merriami), collared peccary (Tayassu
tajacu), Mexican ground squirrel (Spermophilus mexicanus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), tarantula (Aphonopelma chalcodes), and western diamondback rattlesnake
(Crotalus atrox).

CHAPTER 3. CULTURAL SETTING
The project area is located in the Permian Basin of the Southern High Plains (Llano Estacado) archeological
region, which lies immediately to the east of the Pecos River, a physiographic dividing line of the TransPecos and the Southern High plains archaeological regions (Perttula 2004; Turner and Hester 1999). Both
archaeological regions have been extensively researched and comprehensive chronological sequences have
been established for these regions (Turner and Hester 1999). According to research conducted at
archaeological sites in both regions, evidence of human occupation in the regions roughly spans 12,000
years before present (B.P.) (Johnson and Holliday 2004; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). These 12,000 years
of occupation are typically divided into four main periods based on technological and cultural changes seen
throughout the archaeological record. These four main periods are the Paleoindian (12,000/11,500–
8500/8000 B.P.), the Archaic (8500/8000–2000 B.P.), the Late Prehistoric (2000/1500 B.P.–A.D. 1650),
and the Historic (A.D. 1650–1950s) (Johnson and Holliday 2004; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The
following is a general overview of trends seen during each period, followed by a discussion of what
occurred in the Southern High Plains and the Tran-Pecos regions.

Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period was commonly characterized throughout Texas as being populated by nomadic biggame hunters who heavily relied on megafauna of the Pleistocene (e.g., mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel,
and horse) for subsistence (Willey 1966). However, a more accurate description of this stage is presented
by Bousman et al. (1990:22), who state that “this period may have seen use by small, mobile bands of
nonspecialized hunters and gathers occasionally utilizing megafauna perhaps only as the opportunity
arose.” Thus, according to Bousman et al. (1990), Paleoindians used a wider variety of resources than
previously thought. Evidence of this broader resource subsistence is based on the works of Collins
(1998:1505–1506), Collins and Brown (2000), and Johnson (1977). Johnson (1977) reviewed reports on
numerous Paleoindian sites that indicated a range of small and medium fauna were harvested in addition to
big game. Investigations at the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235), the Gault site (41BL323), and Lubbock
Lake (41LU1) provide evidence of small- and medium-sized faunal remains (i.e., turtle, rabbit, squirrel,
snakes, gopher, and deer) associated with megafaunal remains (i.e., bison and mammoth) (Collins
1998:1505–1506). Clovis and Folsom points are the primary diagnostic artifacts associated with this period
(Collins 1995; Turner and Hester 1999).

Archaic Period
The Archaic period is characterized by a shift from big-game hunting subsistence strategies to a less mobile,
more generalized subsistence strategy. This change in subsistence strategies shows a greater exploitation
of local environments with the exploitation of plants and animals located in the immediate vicinity. Along
with the change in subsistence practices, a change is also seen in lithic technology. Evidence of this is
apparent in the archaeological record where lanceolate-shaped points are replaced by dart points that are
stemmed and barbed, and in the creation of ground stone tools typically thought to indicate an increase in
the use of plant materials (Black 1989; Collins 2004). Although Archaic peoples were still nomadic in
nature, traveling became seasonal, using food resources specific to certain localities.

Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric is marked by the replacement of the atlatl with the bow and arrow and by the
production of small arrow points (Hester 1981:122). With this technological advancement an apparent
increase in warfare is reported (Black 1989; Story 1985). During this stage new technological adaptations
came about. As previously mentioned, Late Prehistoric peoples began to use the bow and arrow; however

SWCA Environmental Consultants

this is not the only technological innovation of this time period. Ceramics and agriculture became an
important technological advancement in the lifeways of the Late Prehistoric peoples.

The Southern High Plains Region in Relation to the Cultural Chronology
Although a complete chronological sequence is well represented in the Southern High Plains region, it is
limited to the northern half of the Southern High Plains. Representation of archaeological sites in the
southern half of the Southern High Plains is generally scarce, and knowledge of prehistoric lifeways in this
area is incomplete. This is in part due to a lack of resources within the area. This lack of resources kept
populations low, therefore keeping sites to a minimum. A review of archaeological sites found in the region
revealed that the majority of sites are open campsites consisting of scatters of lithic debris on the surface or
are shallowly buried and burned rock features. Although these types of sites are commonly found
throughout Texas, they are easily disturbed by erosion and modern intrusion (Turner and Hester 1999).
Although the southern half of the Southern High Plains region is lacking in long-term occupation sites and
quarries, the region does contain an important site possibly dating to the Folsom period (12,610–12,170 cal
years B.P.). This particular site, unearthed at Scharbauer Ranch in 1953, is known as the Scharbauer or
Midland site (41MD1). This site is one of the earliest sites known within this region. Investigation of the
site revealed a partial human female cranium, faunal remains from extinct megafauna, and projectile points
dating to the early Paleoindian period (Leffler 2015).
As the Southern High Plains moved into the Archaic period, the southern half of the Southern High Plains
entered a long altithermal phase that lasted around 4000 years (7000–3000 B.P.). The altithermal was a
period with a warmer and drier climate that ultimately led to severe xeric conditions. According to
researchers, the altithermal phase resulted in the “decreased use, if not complete abandonment” of the region
(Johnson and Holliday 2004; Stafford 1981). Most sites recorded in the Southern Panhandle Plains region
date to the Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods.

Historic Context
The Historic period in Texas can be divided into two sub-periods: the Protohistoric and Historic. The
Protohistoric (ca. A.D. 1528–1700) is ushered by the venture into south and southeast Texas by Spanish
explorer Cabeza de Vaca in 1528. Archaeological sites dated to this sub-period contain a mixture of both
European artifacts (e.g., metal and glass arrow points, trade beads, and wheel-made or glazed ceramics)
and traditional Native American artifacts (e.g. manufactured stone tools). The effect the Spanish presence
in Mexico had on Native Americans in Texas prior to about 1700 is not well understood. What is known is
that the initial arrival of Spanish missionaries and explorers spread disease that killed, displaced, and
fragmented a huge percentage of the population. As colonization spread from Mexico, many of the
Coahuiltecan groups moved northward to avoid the Spanish. At the same time, invading Native American
groups from the north put pressure on Native American groups in north Texas (Nickels et al. 1997).
Historians believe that these pressures led to intense territorial disputes, further destabilizing Native
American populations. The establishment of the first Spanish missions and the expansion of the Spanish
Colonial Empire mark the Historic period (ca. 1700–present). Most of our knowledge of this sub-period is
through the written records of early Spanish missionaries and by records kept by local land officials.
Spanish exploration, however, had little direct impact on Reagan County. The area was too remote, and,
except for the area around the Pecos River, remained largely unexplored by Europeans until the end of the
nineteenth century. The first European settlers were ranchers who came in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, though lack of water and other resources hindered significant population growth. These
areas remained sparsely populated until oil was discovered in 1923. Reagan County still relies on petroleum
and ranching as the primary industries today (Smith 2017).

Reagan County
Though early inhabitants of Reagan County remain undocumented, it is likely that Paleoindians lived on
the land that would become Reagan County. Kiowa and Comanche Indians used the area as hunting ground
and later raided local ranches, but it remained largely unsettled country until the nineteenth century (Smith
2017).
An important source of water for prehistoric peoples and early travelers was Grierson Springs, which once
flowed substantially in southwestern Reagan County. Spaniards probably discovered the springs in January
1684, when the expedition of Juan Domínguez de Mendoza arrived there and camped for 2 days (Smith
2017). Both the springs and the camp were named in honor of Col. Benjamin H. Grierson, who located the
camp at the site. Camp Grierson was part of the army’s plan to protect the Euroamerican society in the area
from Native American attack and ultimately to eliminate the Native Americans from Texas (Smith 2017).
At different times, companies D, E, and F of the Tenth Calvary, Company K of the Twenty-fifth Infantry,
and Company K of the Twenty-fourth Infantry were stationed at Camp Grierson. The camp was abandoned
in 1882 when Grierson and his Tenth Cavalry were transferred from Fort Concho to Fort Davis.
In 1910, the economic focus of Reagan County was agriculture, with a total of 51 farms. Common crops
include sorghums, hay, corn, and cotton; and livestock including sheep and cattle (Smith 2017). In May
1923, the economic focus changed from agriculture to petroleum when the Big Lake oilfield began
producing (Smith 2017). The discovery of oil opened the Permian Basin and all of West Texas to oil
exploration and production. Oil wells located on lands given to the University of Texas in 1876
subsequently became a major source of the institution’s endowment (Smith 2017).

CHAPTER 4. METHODS
Background Review
SWCA conducted a background review to identify previous cultural resources surveys, previously recorded
archaeological sites, or any other known cultural resources located within 1 mile of the proposed project
area. To conduct this review, an SWCA archaeologist reviewed the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas
(TASA), the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) database, and historic topographic maps. These
sources provided information on the nature and location of previously conducted archaeological surveys,
previously recorded cultural resources, locations of NRHP-listed properties, sites designated as State
Antiquities Landmarks, Official Texas Historical Markers, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks,
cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys.

Archaeological Survey
The field survey consisted of one team of two SWCA archaeologists walking a single transect within a 100foot-wide (approximately 30.5-meter-wide) survey corridor. Subsurface explorations used during the
survey consisted of the excavation of shovel tests at 100-meter intervals along a single transect. SWCA
keyed the use of shovel tests to the level of disturbance of the proposed project area and the nature of the
soils, geology, and topography. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas where ground surface visibility
was greater than 30 percent. The archaeologists traversed the entire portion of the project area and examined
the ground surface for cultural materials. Other areas of exposed ground surface such as animal burrows
and erosional features were examined for the presence of cultural materials.
Shovel tests measured roughly 30 × 30 centimeters (cm) in size and were excavated in 20-cm arbitrary
levels to a depth of 1 meter or to culturally sterile deposits, whichever came first. All excavated soil was

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed University 11 Pipeline in Reagan County, Texas

screened through ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth to retrieve any cultural materials that might be present. The
location of each shovel test was recorded using a Trimble GEO XT handheld global positioning system
(GPS) receiver. Data for each shovel test were recorded on appropriate field forms. Soils were described
using standard terminology and colors were identified with a Munsell Soil Color Chart. Areas with
previously recorded or newly discovered cultural resources required additional shovel testing, per THC
standards, to explore the nature and extent of the cultural deposits.

CHAPTER 5. RESULTS
Background Review
On April 18, 2017, an SWCA archaeologist conducted a cultural resources background review for the
proposed University 11 Pipeline survey (SWCA Project No. 41886) in Reagan County, Texas. The purpose
of this background review was to identify previous cultural resources surveys, previously recorded
archaeological sites, or any other known historic properties located within 1 mile of the proposed project
area, and to provide a professional assessment regarding the potential for the presence of unrecorded
cultural resources within the proposed project area. Information sources consulted for this background
review include the TASA, the NRHP database, and historic topographic maps.
Review of the TASA revealed 11 previously recorded archaeological sites, no historic districts or markers,
and two previous cultural resources surveys.
Descriptions of 11 previously recorded sites are provided in Table 3. Sites that are within or adjacent to the
proposed ROW are in italics in Table 3 and are described in further detail below.

Note: Italicized text is used in this table to identify sites that are within or adjacent to the proposed ROW.

Site 41RG125 was recorded in January 2012 by Marin Millen of TAS Inc. The site was recorded as an open
campsite with lithic artifacts and fire-cracked rock. All artifacts were surficial, no shovel tests were
excavated, and no artifacts were collected. The site is located approximately 0.20 mile west of the proposed
ROW and approximately 3.22 miles north-northwest of the town of Big Lake, Texas. NRHP eligibility is
undetermined at this time.
Site 41RG260 was recorded in January 2012 by Mike Shimel of TAS Inc. The site was recorded as a lithic
scatter site. All artifacts were surficial, no shovel tests were excavated, and no artifacts were collected. The
site is located approximately 0.17 mile southeast of the proposed ROW, and approximately 2.75 miles
northwest of the nearby town of Big Lake, Texas. NRHP eligibility is undetermined at this time.
Site 41RG258 was recorded in January 2012 by Marin Millen of TAS Inc. The site was recorded as an open
campsite with lithic artifacts and fire-cracked rock. All artifacts were surficial, no shovel tests were
excavated, and no artifacts were collected. The site is located approximately 0.25 mile northwest of the
proposed ROW, and approximately 3.00 miles north-northwest of the town of Big Lake, Texas. NRHP
eligibility is undetermined at this time.
Two previously conducted cultural resources surveys intersect with the proposed project area. The first
(TASA No. 8500073313; TAC Permit No. 7232) was conducted by Jeff Turpin of TAS Inc. on April 1,
2015, and was sponsored by the University of Texas Land System. The second (TASA No. 8500036558;
TAC Permit No. 6098) was a reconnaissance survey conducted by Jeff Turpin of TAS Inc. on January 1,
2012, and was sponsored by University Lands.
Review of the 1954, 1958, and 1965 San Angelo 1:250,000-scale topographic maps revealed a historic
windmill located approximately 70 feet (21.59 meters) outside of the proposed project area. However,
current aerial and satellite imagery do no depict this windmill, and no windmill was found during field
survey efforts. The 1920 and 1922 Big Lake 1:62,500-scale topographic maps do not depict any cultural
features within the proposed project area.
Review of the NRHP database did not reveal any NRHP-listed properties within 1 mile of the proposed
project area.
General Land Office maps are not available for this section of Texas and therefore were not reviewed.

Archaeological Survey
Investigations of the land owned by University Lands involved intensive pedestrian survey augmented by
shovel testing of the entire 3.23-mile-long portion of the proposed pipeline. The archaeologists traversed
the entire portion of the ROW examining the ground surface for cultural materials. Area of exposed ground
surface such as erosional areas, animal burrows, and the like were examined. The area consisted primarily
of mixed grasses and various hardwoods (Figures 2–4), with large areas of exposed bedrock (Figures 5 and
6).

The pedestrian survey was augmented by shovel testing. During the survey 48 shovel test locations were
examined (Figures 7a–7d). Of those, three were not excavated due to disturbance, such as exposed bedrock,
or were deemed unnecessary due to ground surface visibility being greater than 30 percent (Figures 8–11).
These are referred to as “no dig” locations. Because of an error with the GPS unit, the locations of some of
the shovel tests were not recorded with the GPS unit, but instead were plotted on field maps.

The excavated shovel tests revealed varying soil profiles. Soils within the survey area consisted of silt loams
and silty clay loams. One isolated find was observed within the survey corridor and no cultural materials
were recovered from any of the excavated shovel tests. Depths of shovel tests ranged from 10 to 70
centimeters below the surface and were terminated due to bedrock or compact soil. A complete shovel test
log is presented in Appendix B.

Isolated Find 1 (IF01)
IF01 consists of two bifacial thinning flakes found on the surface (Figures 12 and 13). The flakes are both
made of heavily patinated, light brown chert. IF01 is located approximately 0.80 mile west-southwest of
the intersection of Rocker B Lane and Jsw Road. SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive visual
search, augmented by shovel testing, of the area around the find and no other cultural materials were
discovered. Five additional shovel tests were excavated, and all were negative for cultural material. The
surrounding area consisted of mixed grasses and various hardwoods (Figures 14 and 15). Due to a paucity
of material, IF01 is not considered an archaeological site, and is considered not eligible for the NRHP.

Based on the results of the survey and previous disturbances within the proposed project area, it is SWCA’s
opinion that the proposed project will have no effect on historic properties. SWCA therefore recommends
that the proposed project be allowed to proceed with no further archaeological investigations of the
proposed project area. No artifacts were collected, therefore, project paperwork and photographs will be
curated as per the requirements of TAC Permit No. 7994.

CHAPTER 6. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Medallion, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 3.23-mile-long
proposed University 11 Pipeline ROW located on lands owned by University Lands in Reagan County,
Texas. The proposed pipeline will be located on University Lands property and the investigations were
conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas under TAC Permit No.
7994.
The background review revealed 11 previously recorded archaeological sites, no historic districts or
markers, and two previous cultural resources surveys located within 1 mile of the proposed project area.
Three of the previously recorded sites are located within 0,25 mile (406 meters) of the proposed ROW. All
archaeological sites are located well outside of the proposed ROW, and no additional investigations are
recommended at this time.
Investigations of the proposed project area owned by University Lands involved an intensive pedestrian
survey augmented by shovel testing. During the survey, 48 shovel tests locations were inspected. Of these,
three were not excavated because of good ground surface visibility or evident disturbance. Forty-five shovel
tests were excavated, none of which contained cultural materials.
Based on the results of the survey and previous disturbances within the proposed project area, it is SWCA’s
opinion that the proposed project will have no effect on historic properties. SWCA therefore recommends

that the proposed project be allowed to proceed as planned, and that no further archaeological investigations
of the affected portions of the proposed project area are necessary. No artifacts were collected; project
paperwork and photographs will be curated as per the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas.
