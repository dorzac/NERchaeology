ABSTRACT
On behalf of Harris County Engineering Department (HCED), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Edgewater Park project. HCED
has proposed to improve several tracts (approximately 90.5 acres) associated with the Edgewater Park
project in northeastern Harris County, Texas. The exact nature of development/disturbance associated
with the project has not been identified, but preliminary plans include a possible realignment of Hamblen
Road such that it crosses through Tracts 1, 2, and 6.
All work was conducted in support of HCED’s potential application requirements for a U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 Permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January
31, 2007); and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code
[USC] 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800). The project was also conducted in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191),
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8085 and in accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC)
and Council of Texas Archaeologists standards.
The investigation included an archaeological background literature and records review and an intensive
pedestrian survey with shovel testing and deep testing. The background review revealed that no previous
cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the project area and no previously recorded
cultural resources are located within or adjacent to (within 300 feet of) the project area.
During the current investigation, a total of 53 shovel or shovel/auger tests were excavated, six of those
were extended deeper by hand auger; all were negative for cultural materials. A total of 17 backhoe
trenches were excavated across the floodplain portions of the project area.
The current investigation observed that the project area has been disturbed by previous land clearing and
some building construction and demolition associated with a former campground in the 1960s–2000s.
The entire project area has been impacted by significant flooding associated with Hurricane Harvey in
2017. Additionally, a portion of Tract 5 has been impacted by significant flooding in 2002, likely
associated with Hurricane Allison. The current investigation observed remnants of modern structures
which have since fallen or been demolished. A few prehistoric lithics were found approximately 12–50
cmbs mixed with modern historic trash in Tract 5. As there is no contextual integrity to the prehistoric
materials, this location has been identified as 41HR1222.
In accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C; Section 106 of the NHPA (36 CFR 800.4); and the
Antiquities Code of Texas, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic
properties within the proposed project area. Based on the results of this investigation, SWCA
recommends a finding of NO HISTORIC PROPERTIES AFFECTED (per 36 CFR 800.4[d][1]) within
the proposed project area. Per the Antiquities Code of Texas, the documents generated by the
investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Harris County Engineering Department (HCED), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Edgewater Park project in
northeastern Harris County, Texas. HCED has proposed to improve several tracts associated with the
Edgewater Park in northeastern Harris County (“project”). The investigation included an archaeological
background literature and records review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing and
selective deep testing.
All work was conducted in support of HCED’s potential application requirements for a U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 Permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January
31, 2007); and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code
[USC] 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800). The project was also conducted in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191),
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8085, and in accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC)
and Council of Texas Archaeologists standards.

Project Description
HCED has proposed to improve several tracts associated with the Edgewater Park project in northeastern
Harris County. Six tracts have been identified for the project, all of which lie north of the West Fork San
Jacinto River, east of US Highway 59 and State Highway Loop 494, and on either side of Hamblen Road,
covering a total area of 90.5 acres. For this study, the tracts have been labeled 1 through 6. The project
area is depicted on the Maedan and Moonshine Hill 7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic quadrangle maps (Figure 1).
Tracts 1 through 5 are not currently owned by Harris County or other political subdivision of the State of
Texas; Tract 6 is owned by Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The exact nature of
development/disturbance associated with the project has not been identified, but preliminary plans include
a realignment of Hamblen Road such that it crosses through Tracts 1, 2, and 6. The proposed road
realignment also crosses linear easements owned by the Southern Pacific rail line and CenterPoint Energy
that run north-south between the tracts. This crossing will also likely be included in the area of impacts
for the project.

Project Personnel
Todd Butler served as Principal Investigator. Susan Butler managed all fieldwork, data analysis, and
reporting. Fieldwork was completed by Steve Cummins and Brooke Bonorden. Geographic information
systems (GIS) support was provided and report graphics were prepared by GIS Specialist Colleen
Kennedy. The report was written by Susan Butler and edited by Joy Hengst.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project is located within the Flatwoods ecoregion of the South Central Plains (Griffith et al. 2007).
These generally flat plains are characterized by low gradient streams with sand and silt strata (Griffith et
al. 2007). Historically, the area was vegetated by longleaf pine flatwoods and savannas with bluestem
grasses and other herbaceous species in the understory (Griffith et al. 2007). Current vegetation in the
Flatwoods ecoregion includes mixed forest, evergreen forest, deciduous forest, and forested wetlands,
typically utilized for timber production and some pasture and cattle production (Griffith et al. 2007).

Geology
Geologically, the majority of the project area is located on Holocene-age alluvium. A small portion of the
northern part of the project area is situated on the Pleistocene-age Beaumont formation (Barnes 1982).
Holocene alluvium consists of sand, silt, clay, and gravel deposited in the floodplains and on low terraces
along streams and rivers in the last approximately 11,000 years. The Beaumont formation consists of
predominantly fine sands and silts formed in stream channel, point-bar, crevasse-splay, and natural levee
ridge deposits, along with clayey deposits in back-channel sediments. Occasionally, 1- to 2-m-tall pimple
mounds also occur on the Beaumont Formation (Barnes 1982).

Houston PALM
According to Abbott’s (2001) Houston Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), a guide to
archaeological potential related to geomorphology in the Harris County area, the majority of Tracts 1, 4,
and 5 as located in Map Unit 1, with Tracts 2 and 6 mostly falling within Map Unit 3a, and Tract 3 split
evenly between Map Units 1 and 2 (Abbott 2001).
Briefly, Map Unit 1 is characteristic of areas featuring deep Holocene soils with limited surface
disturbance that have good potential to contain deeply buried cultural deposits (Abbott 2001:156). Map
Unit 3a, too, has potential to feature deeply buried cultural deposits; however, surface conditions are
generally thought to preclude deep investigations. If very deep impacts are anticipated, deep testing is
recommended. Map Unit 2 is characterized by Holocene-age deposits resting on Pleistocene landforms;
these soils have little potential for deeply buried deposits and, while surface survey is recommended, deep
testing is not recommended (Abbot 2001:156).

Soils
According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (NRCS 2018), four
soil map units are located within the project area. These include Voss sand (VorA), 0–1 percent slopes,
occasionally flooded; the Hatliff-Pluck-Kian complex (HatA), 0–1 percent slopes, frequently flooded; the
Kenney-Urban land complex (Ku); and Atasco fine sandy loam (AtaC), 2–5 percent slopes. Individual
soils found in the project area are shown in Table 1 and include an estimation of potential for deeply
buried cultural resources derived from the Houston PALM (Abbott 2001). Soils noted as having high
geoarchaeological potential are located in Tracts 3, 4, and 5; the southern two-thirds of Tract 1; and the
southern one-fifth of Tract 2.

CULTURAL SETTING
The project area is located within the Southeast Texas archaeological region (Perttula 2004a). Southeast
Texas is identified to include the upper Texas coast, from the Sabine River southwestward to the Brazos
River delta, and including the adjacent inland coastal plain (Ricklis 2004).

Prehistoric Cultural Setting
The prehistoric cultural setting is divided into three primary periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Ceramic.
The Protohistoric period bridges the gap to the historic period, with the arrival of Europeans to Southeast
Texas. The following summary draws heavily from regional sources found in The Prehistory of Texas
(Perttula 2004b) and a comprehensive regional summary provided by Story (1990) in The Archaeology
and Bioarchaeology of the Gulf Coastal Plain.

Paleoindian Period
In Southeast Texas, the Paleoindian period (ca. 11,500-8000 years before present [B.P.]) is divided into
Early (ca. 11,500-10,000 B.P.) and Late (10,000-8500 B.P.) subperiods (Perttula 2004a:9). Fluted points
are the most commonly known markers of the Paleoindian period. Early types include Clovis and Folsom
points. Late Paleoindian occupation is generally represented by Dalton, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff, in
addition to Plainview and Angostura points (Bousman et al. 2004; Ricklis 2004; Turner et al. 2011).
Few Paleoindian sites have been identified, and of those, none have been systematically excavated in
Southeast Texas. Paleoindian projectile points have been primarily identified by surface collections in the
region, and only about two dozen Paleoindian sites have been recorded in Harris County (Bousman et al.
2004:64). Paleoindian points have been found in excavated contexts, although these have generally been
mixed with materials from later periods. Most have been identified along major stream drainages (Ricklis
2004). It is thought that one factor in the lack of intact Paleoindian sites is due to the submersion of
coastal occupations by an increase in sea level and the lack of preservation across older upland areas
(Aiuvalasit 2007; Aten 1983). Sea levels did not stabilize until the end of the Middle Archaic period,
approximately 5000 B.P. (Aten 1983:157).
One of the largest local collections of Paleoindian artifacts comes from the McFaddin Beach site, located
east of the project area in Jefferson County, Texas. Numerous Paleoindian points have been recovered,
along with a significant amount of materials from later time periods. Research at the site, however,
indicates that artifacts have been re-deposited inland from an unknown location offshore (Brown 2009).
As no excavation has been conducted at the site proper, little is known about the lifeways of individuals
who utilized these projectile points. A second significant site is located in northwest Harris County, where
for the first time, Clovis projectile points have been identified in close association with other Paleoindian
tool types (Crook 2016).
Because no discrete Paleoindian components have been directly excavated in Southeast Texas, there is no
direct evidence for Paleoindian subsistence practices. In other parts of Texas and the Southeastern United
States, early discoveries of Paleoindian artifacts in conjunction with now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna,
such as mastodon and Bison antiquus, strongly biased early descriptions of Paleoindian subsistence
towards exploitation of big game animals (Bousman et al. 2004:15; Williams and Stoltman 1965;
Dillehay 1974). Continued evidence from excavated Paleoindian components outside Southeast Texas
suggests that Paleoindian subsistence was more widely varied, though exploitation of big game was
certainly a part (Bousman et al. 2004:75; Dunbar and Webb 1996).

5

Intensive Archaeological Survey for the Edgewater Park Project, Harris County, Texas

One significant line of evidence for understanding Paleoindian lifeways comes from their diagnostic
projectile points; across North America, archaeologists have documented consistent Paleoindian use of
nonlocal raw materials for stone tool manufacture (Bousman et al. 2004). Most of the recovered points in
Southeast Texas are of a high grade lithic material that is scarce or absent in the region, suggesting a
widespread movement of peoples and materials over long distances in a highly mobile lifestyle that likely
depended on a diverse range of food resources (Ricklis 2004). Due to this high-mobility lifestyle,
population densities were likely low and social structure is hypothesized as relatively simple (Ricklis
2004).

Archaic Period
The Archaic period generally dates to the end of the Wisconsin glaciation and the concomitant extinction
of Pleistocene megafauna. The period is often distinguished by the development of a broad subsistence
base and evidence of a more intensive exploitation of regionally specific plant and animal resources. This
change in subsistence is marked by an adaptation in tool production to conform to new hunting
techniques, food preparation, and related activities.
The Archaic period in Texas is generally defined by pre- or non-horticultural adaptations and pre-ceramic
and pre-bow-and-arrow hunting technologies (Story 1990). In Southeast Texas, the Archaic sequence is
separate for inland groups (ca. 8000–1500 B.P.) and coastal groups (ca. 5000–2200 B.P.), due to the fact
that the coastline was not stabilized until the middle of the Archaic period (Ricklis 2004). Numerous
Archaic sites have been found along inland stream courses in Southeast Texas. The Archaic components
at these sites are represented by various types of flaked stone dart points and other lithic tools. For coastal
groups, the Archaic also includes stratified shell midden sites (Ricklis 2004).
For inland groups, a typological cluster of expanded-stem types dominates the Early Archaic (before ca.
6000 B.P.). Included in this group are early side-notched and early stemmed forms and corner-notched
points of the Keithville, Neches River, and Trinity types. These are followed by massively barbed points
of the Bell/Calf Creek series, as well as non-stemmed Tortugas points and stemmed Wells points (Ricklis
2004).
A variety of Middle Archaic tool types is reported from Southeast Texas, including Yarbrough, Bulverde,
Travis, and Pedernales in the western sector. The predominant Late Archaic types are Kent and Gary,
with Ensor and Godley points common in the western reaches of Southeast Texas (Ricklis 2004). A shift
to the use of poorer quality and more local lithic resources in Late Archaic times suggests reduced group
mobility and more tightly defined group territories (Story 1990). Several Middle to Late Archaic
cemeteries have been reported from the coastal prairies of the western part of southeast Texas. By the
Late Archaic, cemeteries were an integral part of cultural behavior along the inland margins of the coastal
prairies zone, further tying groups to specific locations of shared mortuary practice (Ricklis 2004).

Ceramic Period
The Ceramic period in Southeast Texas begins ca. 2200 B.P., with the introduction of ceramics on the
Texas Coast (Ricklis 2004; Aten 1983). Ceramics would not be found in inland southeast Texas for
several centuries (Ricklis 2004). A later, important technological innovation was the introduction of the
bow and arrow (marked by the appearance of small, light straight and expanded-stem stone point types),
around 1300 B.P. (Ricklis 2004; Story 1990). The Ceramic period of southeast Texas is further divided
into Early and Late subperiods.
The Early Ceramic subperiod shows a continuation of Archaic period subsistence and settlement patterns
(Ricklis 2004). Gary contracting stem points began to replace earlier Kent points. Tchefuncte and

Mandeville ceramics began to be present in small amounts as one moves east towards the Louisiana
border, but sandy Goose Creek ceramics spread throughout an area bounded by the Brazos River to the
west and extend to the upper reaches of the Neches and Angelina Basins (Ricklis 2004; Story 1990:257).
This area has been called the Mossy Grove culture area, and appears to have been a distinct regional
development that persisted through time until the Protohistoric period (Ricklis 2004:190).
On the central Texas coast, the Late Ceramic/Late Prehistoric subperiod saw an apparent division of
Toyah phase groups in inland areas and the Rockport phase groups (Ricklis 2004). Small, light arrow
point types, such as Scallorn, Alba, and Catahoula appear during this time (Ricklis 2004). Goose Creek
ceramics continue along with the introduction of grog-tempered and some bone-tempered ceramics, and
decoration becomes more elaborate, although grog-tempered ceramics are more common and decorations
are less elaborate inland (Ricklis 2004; Story 1990). Additional characteristics of the Late subperiod
include the appearance of bison bone along with a lithic technocomplex of Perdiz arrow points, unifacial
end scrapers, blade-core lithic technology, thin bifacial knifes (often alternately beveled), and expanded
base drills/perforators made from flakes and prismatic blades (Ricklis 2004). The use of cemeteries
continued through the Ceramic period, with the Harris County Boys School Site, including 29 burials on
the western edge of Galveston Bay, and the Mitchell Ridge Site on Galveston Island, presenting notable
examples (Story 1990:242; Ricklis 1994).

Protohistoric Period
Native groups in the Galveston Bay area, due to their proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, had some of the
earliest contact with European explorers and colonists in the history of Texas. However, this contact was
not sustained or formalized, and Native American lifeways predominated in the area until the late
eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries. The Protohistoric period (A.D. 1528 to 1810) began with several
sixteenth-century expeditions to the area, most notably Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca's travels stemming
from the failed Panfilo de Narvaez expedition in 1527. Although it is not completely certain where
Cabeza de Vaca landed, evidence points to Galveston Island (Ricklis 1996:107).
The identity of the inhabitants of the area around Houston at that time is unclear; called the Bidai and the
Patiri, their language is unknown, although it may have been a western Atakapan language (Newcomb
2004). The normal range given to the northernmost Karankawa tribe, the Cocos, generally does not
extend past the Brazos River valley (Ricklis 1996:6). The eastern side of Galveston Bay was inhabited by
a number of Atakapan-speaking groups, including the Atakapans (proper) and the Akokisa (Newcomb
2004). Galveston Bay may have been a dividing line between the Karankawan and Atakapan groups, with
settlements around the bay shifting and levels of interaction changing over time. However, by the later
part of the Protohistoric period, Akokisa villages were recorded up to halfway between the San Jacinto
and Brazos rivers (Aten 1983:35).
Archaeological sites from this period are characterized by a near-disappearance of native-made pottery,
except for Goose Creek Plain (Story 1990:260). Sites 41CH110 and 41CH32 in Chambers County, in the
Trinity River area, both appear to date to this period (Aten 1983:283). At Mitchell Ridge, groups
continued to bury their dead on Galveston Island throughout the Protohistoric period, suggesting little
change in lifeways throughout the period. Conclusively-dated European artifacts do not appear at Mitchell
Ridge until the middle of the eighteenth century (Ricklis 1994:470). Subsistence did not change much
during this period. Hunting, gathering, and fishing still provided the main source of sustenance; however,
the Atakapans and Akokisa appear to have slowly begun to incorporate horticulture into their subsistence
patterns (Newcomb 2004:661).

Historic Cultural Setting
European documentation, control, and exploitation of Texas grew slowly after initial contact in 1528. As
noted, Cabeza de Vaca was shipwrecked near Galveston Bay in 1528, and began a years-long odyssey
living among and documenting the Native American groups of Texas (Hester 1999). Soon afterwards,
remnants of the Hernando de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, crossed through central
Texas in 1542, but found the country “uninviting” (Hudson 1997). As such, there was little interest or
pressure for colonization and Europeans largely avoided the area.

Early Contact/Colonial Era
For approximately 150 years, contact between Native American groups and Europeans was sporadic, until
the French began to make incursions into the western Gulf of Mexico. French explorer Robert Sieur de La
Salle wrecked in Matagorda Bay in 1685, during an attempt to colonize the area (Weddle 2010). This
earliest French presence in Texas proved short-lived, as La Salle’s settlement in Matagorda Bay was
attacked and destroyed, likely by the Karankawa, in 1688. The French incursion into the region provoked
Spanish retaliation, resulting in the spread of the Spanish mission system into South Texas (Weddle
2010).
The Spanish utilized a system of missions and forts to convert and pacify the native populations in eastern
Texas. The first mission to the Caddoan speaking peoples of east Texas, San Francisco de los Tejas was
founded along the Neches river in 1690 (Chipman and Joseph 2010:86). Efforts along the coastal plain
continued through the 1700s. These included Mission Espíritu Santo de Zuniga, established in 1722 near
Matagorda Bay and then moved to Victoria County in 1726 (Walter 1999); Presidio La Bahia and
Mission Rosario, established in 1749 and 1754, respectively, in Goliad County (Ricklis 1999); and
Mission Nuestra Señora de Refugio, which was built on the mouth of the Mission River and lasted until
1828 (Newcomb 1961:63). Missions located on the San Gabriel River, near present-day Rockdale, Texas,
attracted some of the displaced Atakapan inhabitants of the Galveston Bay area.
In response to increasing French fur-trading expeditions west from the Louisiana Territory, the Spanish
established a small mission and presidio at San Agustín de Ahumada, near the village of El Orcoquisac
on the Trinity River between 1756 and 1771 (Newcomb 2004). Though the missions continued operating
throughout the Spanish Colonial period, they were often impermanent, due to consistent antagonism
between the missions and local populations, as well as often receiving poor support from the far-removed
colonial government (Ricklis 1999; Newcomb 2004; Carlson and Corbin 1999). Though the Spanish
claimed the area, the Texas coastal plain would remain mostly native until the Mexican revolution and the
enticement of empresarios and colonists to the area. Even by 1804, the total non-native population of
Texas, even including better populated parts of central Texas at San Antonio, were likely less than 4,000
(Chipman and Joseph 2010:219).
After Mexico gained independence from Spain, Mexico attempted to create a more populated buffer state
in Texas, in an effort to protect against encroachments by the nascent United States of America. To this
end, Mexican officials invited colonization of Texas, doling out land to farmers and ranchers and
deferring payment for several years (Henderson 1928). These policies also continued the Spanish system
of empresarios, by which land agents could obtain large grants of lands, which could then be separately
divided, instead of individual families petitioning the Mexican authorities. The area around Houston was
not initially included in any empresario grant, but petitions from new colonists soon had the area, which
was valued for the ease of transportation on the San Jacinto and Trinity River watersheds, added to
Stephen F. Austin’s grant (Henson 2010).

A majority of the empresarios and colonists were Anglo-American and white settlers (Henderson 1928).
Slavery was allowed within Mexico, until banned by President Guerrero in 1829; however, Texas was
specifically exempted (De León 2010). Despite this favorable treatment, suspicions of the increasingly
Anglo-American character of Texas and the increasing power and autonomy of Anglo-Americans in
Texas led to pushes by the Mexican central authorities under General Santa Ana to revoke the
colonization laws and promote a general trend of de-federalization of political control (De León 2010).
Viewing these capricious changes to law as tyranny, a number of Texans, including several former
empresarios, convened and declared independence for the Republic of Texas on March 2, 1836 (De León
2010).

Republic of Texas/Pre-Civil War
After the defeat of Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, the new Texan Congress settled on the nascent
town of Houston as the first national capital, and formed the county of Harrisburg (later to be renamed
Harris) in late 1836 and Montgomery County in 1837 (Henson 2010; McComb 1969). Although the
capital was short-lived, and relocated to Austin in 1839, the new city continued to grow, albeit slowly.
For a new, small, and relatively poor nation, protection and recognition by foreign nations was vitally
important. Annexation by the United States had always been one distinct possibility for Texas, and one
that was promoted by Sam Houston during his first term as president (Nance 2010). By the 1844 United
States presidential election, the question of Texas annexation was also on the front of the United States’
national mind. The election of expansionist President James K. Polk was taken as a good sign of the
desire of the United States to include another slave state in the nation and Texas President Anson Jones
pushed for Texans to vote on the issue (Nance 2010). On October 13, 1845, annexation and the new
Texas State Constitution were accepted by overwhelming popular vote, and Texas became a part of the
United States on December 29, 1845 (Nance 2010).
The subsequent years leading up to the Civil War were generally a time of expansion and consolidation of
the primarily plantation-based farming economy, especially within the coastal plain region. Cotton
production increased over 600 percent between 1849 and 1859 (Britton et al. 2010). Slavery also
expanded at an astounding rate. Between 1850 and 1860, the overall number of slaves increased by
130,000, expanding from 27 percent of the population to 30 percent of the population in the years just
before the Civil War (Campbell 2013). At the same time, other industries grew slowly, possibly due to the
overwhelming reliance on “King Cotton.” Only 5 percent of Texans were involved in commercial activity
and only 1 percent involved in manufacturing (Campbell 2013). Transportation technology represented
one of the few areas of industrial development. By 1850, Houston was the home to the first railroad in
Texas, the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado (later to be known as the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San
Antonio) ran a line west through Houston (Werner 2010). A second line opened to the northwest in 1856,
and by 1861, there was around 470 miles of track already laid in Texas (Werner 2010).

Civil War Period
Although Governor Sam Houston opposed any step that might lead Texas to break from the Union that he
had fought so hard to join, Texans voted to secede from the United States in February of 1861 (Wooster
2010). Up to 90,000 Texans served in the Confederate forces, mostly fighting outside the state
boundaries. Only the seacoast saw significant fighting during the war and most action focused on
Galveston (Wooster 2010). Although Houston was not directly affected by fighting during the Civil War,
prices rose and hardship increased (McComb 1969:75). In June of 1865, two U.S. regiments reoccupied
Houston, installing a military government in the city (McComb 1969:77).

Post-Civil War/Reconstruction
Reconstruction brought massive changes to the economic and cultural systems of Texas. Many of the
former agricultural elites lost much of their wealth as a result of the abolition of slavery (Moneyhon
2010). At the same time, former slaves, now emancipated, were provided with little support from their
former masters. There was some political advancement, including the election of black aldermen in
Houston for the first time (McComb 1969:81). Change was relatively slow, otherwise. The railroads
slowly expanded throughout the postwar period, with the Houston East and West Texas Railway crossing
north and east of Houston completed between 1876 and 1886 (Young 2010). Cotton remained the most
significant cash crop (Moneyhon 2010). Northeast of the Houston area, lumber exploitation was an
important industry, spurred on by the expanding railway supply lines (Long 2016).

Late Nineteenth/Early Twentieth Century
After 1880, rail transportation in the region increased significantly, principally following the introduction
of the Texas and New Orleans Railroad (now the Southern Pacific Transportation Company) in 1860,
which linked Houston to Orange. This railroad was later linked to the Louisiana and Western Railroad
with through service to the City of New Orleans in 1881 (Kleiner 2008). By 1890, Midwestern developers
had purchased land along the new North Galveston, Houston, and Kansas City Railroad, which headed
east from Houston along the southern side of Buffalo Bayou towards Morgan’s Point. This was done to
attract other out-of-state farmers to raise fruit, berries, and vegetables, or just to seek a more temperate
climate (Henson 2008).
Oil exploration in the early-twentieth century generated a population explosion in the region, particularly
in Humble with the oil boom at Moonshine Hill in 1905. Oil was also discovered at Goose Creek and
Tabbs Bay, which led to the establishment of a temporary boomtown from 1915 to 1917. In 1919, Ross
Sterling and the Humble Oil and Refining Company (now Exxon) built a refinery near the oilfield on the
San Jacinto above the mouth of Goose Creek. The development of the area as an industrial hub really
began in 1911, when the formation of the Houston Ship Channel Navigation District was approved
(Sibley 2010). The 50-mile-long channel was deepened and eventually widened to allow oceangoing
vessels. Petroleum and other refineries popped up all along Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River
(Henson 2008; Kleiner 2008). In modern times, the region’s economy continues to center around the
shipping, agricultural, and petroleum industries. Many residents of the region find employment in the
Houston metropolitan area.

BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review consisted of a cultural resources and environmental literature review of the
project area. An SWCA archaeologist reviewed the corresponding USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle maps on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA), a restricted online database maintained
by the THC and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, for any previously recorded surveys and
historic or prehistoric sites located in or near the project area. Site files, relevant maps, National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP), and State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) listings were also examined. These
sources provided information on the nature and location of previously conducted archaeological surveys
and previously recorded cultural resource sites. The Texas Historic Overlay (Foster et al. 2006), aerial
photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology maps, and the NRCS Web Soil Survey were also examined
for historical and environmental information related to the project area. Entries in TASA are limited to
projects under purview of the Antiquities Code of Texas or the NHPA of 1966; therefore, all previous
work conducted in an area may not be available.

Previous Investigations
The background review revealed that the proposed project area has not been previously surveyed for
cultural resources (Figure 2, Table 2). At least one survey was conducted immediately adjacent to the
project area within the existing right-of-way (ROW) of State Highway Loop 494 from McClellan Road to
Kingwood Road; this survey found the ROW too disturbed to contain intact cultural deposits (Young
2008). In addition, at least five cultural resource surveys have been conducted within 1 mile of the
proposed project area. Project types range from highway improvements to trail development for project
sponsors including the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and Harris County Parks
Department.

Previously Recorded Cultural Resources
The background review revealed that no cultural resources had been previously identified within the
proposed project area. One cultural resource, the NRHP-listed State Highway 35 Bridge, is situated
adjacent to the southwest corner of the project area; however, the bridge will not be impacted by the
proposed project. Additional cultural resources recorded within 1 mile of the project area include three
prehistoric archaeological sites identified during the Spring Creek Greenway Trail survey along the West
Fork San Jacinto River, as well as an historic cemetery (see Figure 2,Table 3).

Potential Cultural Resources
Historical maps (USGS 1919; 1920; 1932; 1961a, b;1982; 1995a, b) and aerial photographs (Google
Earth 2018; National Environmental Title Research [NETR] 1957, 1964, 1981, 1995, 2004) were
reviewed for the project area. In general, these show that the project area was largely rural during the first
half of the twentieth century.
At the time of the earliest map, a USGS topographic map dating to 1919, only one structure was located
within the project area in Tract 6 (USGS 1919). The railroad that crosses between Tracts 4 and 5,
originally identified as the Houston East and West Texas Railroad (now owned by Southern Pacific), was
constructed in the late nineteenth century and is present on these earliest maps (USGS 1919; Young
2010). The general area is identified as the community of Weeden, although no other information on this
community is readily available. The structure shown on the 1919 map does not appear to be present in an
aerial photograph of the area in 1944, which shows the project area covered in open pasture with scattered
trees (Google Earth 2018).
A 1957 aerial photograph of the area shows that the area near the 1919 structure had been developed in
the late 1940s or early 1950s, with buildings appearing in that vicinity (NETR 1957). In addition, the
pond on the south side of Tract 3 had been extensively modified around that time; a structure is noted
approximately 290 feet north of the pond and 100 feet west of the railroad in the northeastern corner of
Tract 3 in 1964 (NETR 1964). Tract 4 also began to be developed at this time as a campground. The 1957
aerial photograph shows at least four structures within Tract 4 (NETR 1957). The 1961 USGS
topographic map of the area shows at least seven structures (USGS 1961).
The second half of the twentieth century saw less development. Many of the structures built during the
late 1950s and 1960s were demolished between 1995 and 2004 (NETR 1995, 2004). This period also saw
the extensive clearing of the eastern portion of Tract 5 (NETR 2002). Tract 1 remained undeveloped
throughout this period.

FIELDWORK METHODOLOGY
SWCA conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed project area according to Section
106 of the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The survey was of sufficient intensity to determine
the nature, extent, and, if possible, significance of any cultural resources located within the proposed
project area. The survey met all THC minimum archaeological survey standards for such projects with
any exceptions thoroughly documented.

Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
During the survey, the SWCA archaeologists examined the ground surface and eroded profiles for
cultural resources. Shovel testing was the general method of subsurface explorations utilized during the
survey. The utilization of shovel tests was keyed to the level of disturbance within the area and the nature
of the soils, geology, and topography. Shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and were excavated in 20cm arbitrary levels to culturally sterile deposits. The matrix was screened through ¼-inch hardware mesh.
The location of each shovel test was plotted using a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, and each
test was recorded on appropriate project field forms.
Shovel tests were systematically excavated within the project area, as per the Texas survey standards. For
reference, THC survey standards call for 1 shovel test for every 3 acres for projects of this size.
Accordingly, SWCA estimated a total of 45 shovel tests would be excavated.

Archaeological Deep Testing
Based on the prior review of soils in the area, SWCA recommended deep testing for the portion of the
project area in the floodplain of the West Fork San Jacinto River, except for the portion in Tract 3 which
has been previously impacted by a large pond. For the upland portions of Tracts 1, 2, and 6, SWCA
recommended archaeological survey without deep testing. SWCA estimated that a total of 17 backhoe
trenches would be selectively excavated within the approximate floodplain portion of the project area.
Backhoe trench placement was based on the level of disturbance within the study area, the location of any
buried utilities, and the preservation potential for archaeological sites. Controlled trenching with a
backhoe in noted areas was conducted to test for deeply buried cultural deposits. Each trench was
monitored by an SWCA archaeologist while arbitrary levels were excavated to culturally sterile deposits
or to a depth of 8 feet (approximately 240 cmbs). Depending on the soils observed within the excavated
trench, an excavated matrix column and/or scraped profile was screened through ¼-inch hardware mesh.
The location of each trench was plotted using a GPS receiver, and contents of each soil stratum was
recorded on standardized field forms.
All trench excavations were performed in accordance with Occupational Health and Safety
Administration (OSHA) regulations (29 CFR Part 1926) and the Texas Trench Safety Act (Texas Health
and Safety, Title 9, Code 756). Appropriate measures were taken for any trenches that exceeded 2 m in
depth, utilizing shoring or the stepping back of sidewalls to insure all OSHA protocols were followed.
SWCA thoroughly photographed the entire process. All trenches were backfilled and leveled upon
completion of excavation and recording.

Intensive Archaeological Survey for the Edgewater Park Project, Harris County, Texas

Site Recording
All archaeological sites encountered during the investigations were explored as thoroughly as possible
with consideration to land access constraints. Each identified site was assessed in regard to potential
significance, so that recommendations could be made for proper management (avoidance, non-avoidance,
or further work).
Additional shovel tests were excavated, per THC standards, at all identified sites to define horizontal and
vertical boundaries and assess the nature of the cultural deposits. Where practical, site delineation shovel
tests were excavated at 10-m intervals in a grid-like manner within the survey corridor. A State of Texas
Archaeological Site Form was completed for each site discovered during the investigations. A detailed
plan map of each site was produced, and site locations were plotted on USGS 7.5-minute topographic
maps and relevant project maps.

Curation
No cultural material was collected; therefore, no curation of artifacts will be required for this project. Per
the Antiquities Code of Texas, the documents generated by the investigation will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin. Records, files, field notes, forms, documentation of
artifacts, and other required documentation will be archived and included in the curation package
according to Texas Archeological Research Laboratory guidelines.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
On August 6–8, and 13–14, 2018, SWCA conducted an archaeological investigation within the project
area. The investigation consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing, with deep testing by auger or
backhoe in selected locations. Shovel test detail for the following discussions can be found in Appendix
A. Details for trenches can be found in Appendix B.
The general setting of the project area can be characterized as consisting primarily of undeveloped
woodlands with natural depressional areas which, when overfilled, drain into the West Fork San Jacinto
River (SWCA 2017). Approximately 14 acres of the project area is within wetlands (SWCA 2017). The
remaining portions of the project area included herbaceous, scrub-shrub, and forested vegetation
communities and included yaupon, sweet gum, magnolia, loblolly pine, Chinese tallowtree, water oak,
and cypress, in addition to various sedges and grasses, blackberry vines, and horsebrier (SWCA 2017).
Portions of the project area have been disturbed by land clearing and some areas with building
construction and demolition. Much of the area has modern flood deposits and associated trash, along with
some discrete areas of modern trash dumping. The project area was impacted by significant flooding
associated with Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The western portion of Tract 5 was also impacted by
significant flooding in 2002, likely associated with Hurricane Allison.
The archaeological survey included the excavation of 53 shovel or shovel/auger tests; all were negative
for cultural materials (Figure 3). Typical shovel tests contained sand, sandy loam, and sandy clay. Shovel
tests were generally terminated due to basal clay, root impasse, disturbance, or to depth (100 cmbs).
Approximately 45 percent of the project area is located within the floodplain of the West Fork San Jacinto
River, primarily in Tracts 1, 3, 4, and 5 (SWCA 2017). A total of 17 trenches were excavated by backhoe
in Tracts 3, 4, and 5 to determine the potential for buried cultural materials. The floodplain area in Tract 1
was too densely vegetated to allow for backhoe access to excavate trenches. As such, shovel tests in this
area were excavated to 100 cmbs and then hand augered as deep as possible (generally 150–165 cmbs).
Trenches were approximately 8 feet in length and were excavated to depths of approximately 110 cmbs
(3.6 feet) to 240 cmbs (8 feet). Most of the trenches were unstable or collapsed during excavation;
therefore, the archaeologists generally did not enter the trenches and instead photographed and estimated
measurements due to safety concerns. No shovel/auger tests or backhoe trenches revealed a buried soil
horizon conducive with prehistoric habitation. Results of these excavations show that the area has been
highly disturbed to significant depths.

Tract 1 Results
Tract 1 consists of an upland area with piney woods on the northern portion, a large wetland/lowland in
the middle, and a lowland floodplain in the southern portion. The tract was moderately to densely
vegetated with secondary growth of yaupon, tallowtree, and greenbrier (Figure 4).
A total of 13 shovel/auger tests were excavated within Tract 1; all were negative for cultural materials. A
typical shovel test in Tract 1 consisted of 15–30 cm of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam over
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand or mottled light yellowish brown and brownish yellow (10YR 6/4 and
10YR 6/8) sandy clay loam to approximately 100 cmbs. Six of the shovel/auger tests in the southern
portion of Tract 1 were excavated to 100 cmbs and then hand augered as deep as possible, as the area was
too overgrown to allow access for a backhoe to excavate trenches. These shovel/auger tests were
terminated generally 150–165 cmbs at basal clay or due to the water table (Figure 5).

Tract 2 Results
Tract 2 is primarily an upland with forest vegetation and wetland in the southern portion of the tract
(Figure 6). A total of eight shovel tests were excavated in Tract 2; all were negative for cultural materials.
A typical shovel test in Tract 2 consisted of 10–20 cm of dark gray (10YR 4/1) or light yellowish brown
(10YR 6/4) sandy loam over reddish brown (2.5YR 4/6) or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay or
clay to depths of 25–60 cmbs.

Figure 6. Typical overview of Tract 2, near Shovel Test 25, facing west.

A review of historical maps and aerial photographs show that Tract 2 has been undeveloped. A 1944
aerial photograph shows that the northern two-thirds of Tract 2 had been cleared. Subsequent images
show the tract becoming more vegetated. No cultural resources were identified in Tract 2.

Tract 3 Results
The northern portion of Tract 3 is within a partially wooded upland (Figure 7). The southern portion of
Tract 3 is almost entirely within a wetland. Three shovel tests were excavated within Tract 3; all were
negative for cultural materials. A typical shovel test in Tract 3 consisted of 15–20 cm of gray (10YR 5/1)
sandy loam over 10YR 5/6 or 10YR 6/4 sandy loam or sandy clay loam to depths of 35–100 cmbs,
terminating at depth, a root impasse, or basal clay.
Three trenches (8–10) were excavated within Tract 3 (Figure 8). Each trench was comprised of sandy clay
loam, sand, and/or sandy clay. Trench 8 collapsed at approximately 125 cmbs, about the same depth as
the water table; no cultural materials were identified. Trench 9 collapsed at approximately 165 cmbs; no
cultural materials were identified. Trench 10 was excavated to approximately 125 cmbs, about the same
depth as the water table; several pieces of modern glass were observed between 115–125 cmbs.

A review of historical maps and aerial photographs show the wetland in the southern portion of Tract 3 as
early as 1932. The northern half of Tract 3 had been previously cleared by 1944; subsequent images show
the area becoming more heavily vegetated. A structure is shown in the northeastern portion of Tract 3
from 1964 and later. During the current survey, fallen/dilapidated structures were observed in this
location (Figure 9). The structures appear to include a wooden building with wire nails and a metal shed
with a corrugated metal roof; the structures may be connected. As these structures are modern, this will
not be considered an archaeological site. No cultural resources were identified within Tract 3.

Figure 9. Fallen/dilapidated modern corrugated metal shed and wood
structure in the northwestern portion of Tract 3, facing north.

Tract 4 Results
Tract 4 consists of areas of cleared and forested floodplain of the West Fork San Jacinto River. Several
two-track roads cross the tract (Figure 8). A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated in Tract 4; all were
negative for cultural materials. Shovel tests in Tract 4 varied in composition, due to flooding depositions,
generally consisting of sandy clay loam over sand, sandy clay, or clay fill, with most shovel tests
terminating at depth (100 cmbs). Modern trash due to flood deposition is found across the area.
Seven trenches (1–7) were excavated within Tract 4. Each trench was comprised of sandy clay loam,
sand, and/or sandy clay (Figure 11). Trenches 1, 5, and 7 were excavated into the water table (at 190, 160,
and 115 cmbs, respectively) and the trenches collapsed soon after; no cultural materials were identified.
Modern trash was observed 0–25 cmbs in Trench 2, which collapsed at approximately 180 cmbs. Trench
3 and Trench 6 were excavated until the walls collapsed at 110 and 125 cmbs, respectively; no cultural
materials were identified. Trench 4 was excavated to approximately 125 cmbs, when the wall collapsed;
modern trash (coke can, barbed wire, beer bottles, and a small ceramic bowl) was observed throughout
the trench from 12–125 cmbs (Figure 12–Figure 13).

A review of historical maps and aerial photographs show that Tract 4 had been previously cleared by
1944. Portions of the tract began to be developed in association with a campground in the late 1950s and
by 1961, seven structures can be seen on maps or photographs until the early 2000s, when most had been
demolished.

The current investigation located a number of concrete slabs/foundations near Trench 10 that correlate to
these campground locations (Figure 14). A concrete slab/basketball court (not visible on maps or aerials)
was identified near Tract 1 (Figure 15). A large area of concrete rubble push piles is located near Trench
10 and likely is the remnants from the demolition of these structures. As these slabs associated with
demolished structures are modern, they will not be considered an archaeological site. No cultural
resources were identified in Tract 4.

Tract 5 Results
Tract 5 consists of floodplain of the West Fork San Jacinto River. The tract has been previously cleared
and currently consists of areas with thick understory (Figure 16) and recent flood deposits (Figure 17).
Several two-track roads cross the tract. A total of 17 shovel tests were excavated in Tract 5; all were
negative for cultural materials. Shovel tests in Tract 5 varied in composition, due to significant flooding
deposition. Shovel tests generally consist of sand, sandy clay loam, and sandy clay, with most shovel tests
terminating at depth (100 cmbs). Modern trash due to flood deposition is found across the area and a
concrete rubble push pile and modern trash dump were observed in the northern portion of the tract.

Seven trenches (11–17) were excavated within Tract 5 (Figure 18–Figure 19). Each trench was comprised
of sandy clay loam, sand, sandy clay, and clay. Trenches 11, 15, and 17 were terminated at basal clay
between 210–240 cmbs. Trenches 12 and 14 were terminated due to the water table at 130 cmbs. Trench
13 collapsed at 200 cmbs. Trenches 11, 12, 14, 16, and 17 were negative for cultural materials.

Trench 15 had recent flood/trash deposits from the surface to approximately 70 cmbs, as well as
unidentified concrete at the base (240 cmbs). Trench 13 also contained modern trash from the surface to
approximately 50 cmbs (Figure 20); however, some prehistoric chert artifacts, including four flakes, one
shatter, one possible expedient tool, and one possible broken biface mixed in from approximately 12–50
cmbs (Figure 21). Additional shovel tests around the trench were excavated to delineate the find; all were
negative for prehistoric cultural materials, although modern trash was observed.

A review of historical maps and aerial photographs show that Tract 5 has been previously cleared. The
western portion of the tract has been impacted by significant flooding in 2002, likely associated with
Hurricane Allison, as well as in 2017 from Hurricane Harvey. The results of the shovel tests and backhoe
trenches clearly show that there is no contextual integrity to the prehistoric materials; this location has
been identified as 41HR1222 (Figure 22).

Tract 6 Results
Tract 6 is a small disturbed area with gravel and fill. Current vegetation included short grasses (Figure
23). One shovel test was excavated in this area and consisted only of disturbed clay fill with gravel. No
cultural materials were observed.

Figure 23. Typical overview of Tract 6, near Shovel Test 23, facing south.

A review of historical maps and aerial photographs show a possible structure between 1919 and 1932, but
was gone by 1944. A large building/structure was located in this tract starting around 1986 until it was
demolished in 2002. No cultural resources were identified in Tract 6.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of HCED, SWCA conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Edgewater
Park project. HCED has proposed improvements to several tracts (approximately 90.5 acres) associated
with the Edgewater Park project in northeastern Harris County, Texas. The exact nature of
development/disturbance associated with the project has not been identified, but preliminary plans include
a possible realignment of Hamblen Road such that it crosses through Tracts 1, 2, and 6.
All work was conducted in support of HCED’s potential application requirements for a USACE Section
404 Permit in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C; and Section 106 of the NHPA (16 USC
470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800). The project was also conducted in compliance with
the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191), under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 8085, and in accordance with THC and Council of Texas Archaeologists
standards.
The investigation included an archaeological background literature and records review and an intensive
pedestrian survey with shovel testing and deep testing. The background review revealed that no previous
cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the project area and no previously recorded
cultural resources are located within or adjacent to (within 300 feet of) the project area.
During the current investigation, a total of 53 shovel or shovel/auger tests were excavated, six of those
were extended deeper by hand auger; all were negative for cultural materials. A total of 17 backhoe
trenches were excavated across the floodplain portions of the project area.
The current investigation observed that the project area has been disturbed by previous land clearing and
some building construction and demolition associated with a former campground in the 1960s–2000s.
The entire project area has been impacted by significant flooding associated with Hurricane Harvey in
2017. Additionally, a portion of Tract 5 has been impacted by significant flooding in 2002, likely
associated with Hurricane Allison. The current investigation observed remnants of modern structures
which have since fallen or been demolished. A few prehistoric lithics were found approximately 12–50
cmbs mixed with modern historic trash in Tract 5. 41HR1222 was investigated and recorded. As there is
no contextual integrity to the prehistoric materials, 41HR1222 is recommended not eligible for NRHP.
In accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C; Section 106 of the NHPA (36 CFR 800.4); and the
Antiquities Code of Texas, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic
properties within the proposed project area. Based on the results of this investigation, SWCA
recommends a finding of NO HISTORIC PROPERTIES AFFECTED (per 36 CFR 800.4[d][1]) within
the proposed project area. Per the Antiquities Code of Texas, the documents generated by the
investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Laboratory in Austin.
