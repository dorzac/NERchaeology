ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape) of Houston, Texas completed an
intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey on a 154.6-hectares (382-acre) tract in Harris
County. Two previously identified archaeological sites are within the project area (Sites
41HR344 and 41HR354). The intensive pedestrian survey resulted in the identification of 8
previously unrecorded cultural resources loci. Three of these newly identified sites were
identified as possible candidates for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). Additional testing was performed to evaluate the NRHP eligibility status of these
cultural resources. The intensive pedestrian survey occurred between April 11 and May 10,
2005. The eligibility testing was conducted between July 11 and August 10, 2005.
No further work is recommended at newly identified Sites 41HR998, 41HR999,
41HR1001, and Isolates 1, 2, and 3. Previously identified Site 41HR344 was not relocated.
It is likely that erosion along Cypress Creek has destroyed this light density site. HRA Gray
& Pape recommends that no further archaeological investigation be required in this area.
Previously identified Site 41HR354, a prehistoric isolate, was originally recorded at the
surface near an animal burrow. The recorded location of this site may be in error, or it has
been destroyed by erosion or channalization.
Site 41HR997 was identified as a prehistoric campsite, and is recommended as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Current development plans include avoidance of this site
and dedication of the property to Harris County as public parkland.
Site 41HR1000 is identified as a prehistoric campsite situated on a terrace located
along the north bank of Cypress Creek. A small portion in the central and southernmost
section of the site maintains integrity, has the potential to yield information important to the
understanding of prehistory in the area, and is recommended as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP.
Artifacts recovered during field investigation are temporarily stored at the Houston
office of HRA Gray & Pape. All artifacts were recovered from property that is currently
privately owned. Therefore, following the completion of this project it is anticipated that all
artifacts will be provided to the landowners.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

V&W Partners proposes to develop approximately 154.6 hectares (382 acres) of
property in northern Harris County, Texas. As currently planned, “The Vintage”
residential development will be bounded along its northern margin by Louetta Road, by
U.S. Highway 249 to the west, Cutten Road to the east, and Cypress Creek to the south.
The property consists primarily of woodlands, and contains a large man-made lake that is
situated along the southern edge of the tract near Cypress Creek (Figure 1).
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of Houston, Texas (HRA Gray & Pape) completed an
intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey on the 154.6-hectares (382-acre) tract as
part of the United States Army Corps of Engineers Permit application process. The goals
of the cultural resources survey were to determine if the proposed development would
affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to
establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within
the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). Two previously identified archaeological
sites were recorded as being located with the project APE (Sites 41HR344 and
41HR354). The intensive pedestrian survey resulted in the identification of 8 previously
unrecorded cultural resources loci (41HR997, 41HR998, 41HR999, 41HR1000,
41HR1001; Isolates 1, 2 and 3). Three of these newly identified sites (41HR997,
41HR1000, and 41HR1001) were identified as possible candidates for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Additional testing was performed to
evaluate the NRHP eligibility status of these cultural resources. This report presents the
results of survey and evaluation efforts in The Vintage project area, and provides
recommendations for the management of the cultural resources that were identified
during this investigation.
All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the
Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (NHPA) guidelines. A portion of the project area
included property identified as an easement maintained by the Harris County Flood
Control Department. Therefore, a portion of this work was completed under Texas
Antiquities Permit number 3737.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Vintage development project will include construction of residential homes,
commercial centers, residential streets, utilities, and detention ponds. The APE for this
project is defined as all property within the approximately 154.6-hectares (382-acre)
tract. Subsurface disturbance associated with utility line construction is expected to reach
a maximum depth of approximately 2.44 to 3.05 meters (8 to 10 feet) and detention basin

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

This section provides a discussion of the general geomorphological characteristics
found in Harris County. It is followed by discussions of soil morphology, climate, and
floral and faunal species typical of the area.

GEOLOGY & GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The coastal plain
is characterized by a low topographic relief and extends from Florida to Mexico. The
Texas Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far
west as the Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphological
characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland areas, which includes Harris
County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea
level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the continent, and
subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the region’s
rivers. Harris County is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks and
unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001;
Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott
2001; Aronow 1992; Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of longterm human occupation in modern-day Harris County include the Willis, Lissie (also
called Montgomery) and Beaumont formations, and younger Late Pleistocene to early
Holocene units such as the so-called “Deweyville” terraces, positioned stratigraphically
between the Beaumont and Recent deposits. These terraces date to between one hundred
thousand to four thousand years ago, and are characterized as consisting “of up to three
inset fluvial terraces…(distinguished by the presence of)…large looping meander
scars…” indicative of watercourses capable of fluvial action and discharge markedly
greater than that seen today (Abbot 2001: 16). Overlaying these deposits may be
relatively thick or thin Holocene deposits, laid down in the Harris County area by alluvial
or eolian factors, or potentially, marshy environments.
Along smaller rivers, such as the San Jacinto and Trinity, valley infilling has not
advanced to the point where these “Deweyville” formations are completely buried by
Holocene sediments. Consequently, remnants of these deposits are preserved as terraces
that are situated between modern floodplain and upland areas. These terraces would have
been relatively elevated and dry surfaces within the valleys until they were covered by
aggrading overbank deposits (Abbot 2001: 16). Given their physical characteristics, the
“Deweyville” terraces may have been attractive loci for human occupation during the
Holocene. While primary “Deweyville” deposits have a low potential for archaeological

4

remains, the age of these formations are not clearly established. Therefore, the possibility
for buried archaeological remains exists within portions of the “Deweyville” formation
(Abbot 2001: 106).
The project area and much of northwestern Harris County is underlain by the
Lissie Formation (Abbot 2001; Aronow cited in Wheeler 1976:43-45; Barnes 1982). The
Lissie is estimated to be approximately 150,000 years old (Aronow 1992:5-6). It is
fluvial in origin, arenaceous (sandy) in character, and typically does not display relict
fluvial morphology. With respect to archaeological excavations, recognition of the Lissie
surface is important. This is because no cultural materials can be expected to occur
below the soils developed on the Lissie surface.
Saul Aronow (1992) provided some distinguishing characteristics of the Lissie
surface that help archaeologists and geologists recognize it in the field. He notes:
“The commonest surface signature of the Lissie are circular to elliptical undrained
depressions and pimple mounds (to be discussed later) both of which, at least in
part, eolian in origin. Vertisols are rare on the Lissie surface, though potential
"fat" or plastic clays are abundant in the subsurface (Aronow 1992:5).”
Aronow (1992) also notes that:
“since their deposition during at least two high interglacial sea level stands, the
surfaces of the Lissie units have been water-eroded, mass-wasted, modified by
wind deflation and deposition, churned by burrowing organisms and tree roots,
and disturbed by windthrown trees. All of these have obliterated the original
topography (Aronow 1992:5)”
Features such as pimple mounds and undrained depressions (also called “bagols”)
are abundant on the upland landscape in early maps of the project area (see United States
Geologic Survey 1916, 1920, and 1937 Cypress Creek 7.5’ Quadrangle maps). This
suggests that upland soils in the project area developed directly on the Lissie surface, and
that cultural materials associated with them should be close to the ground surface and
accessible by conventional shovel testing. These features are not as visible in the
meander belt of Cypress Creek, where the Lissie surface has been deeply cut and eroded
by the creek and its tributaries. The meander belt of Cypress Creek is now filled with
Holocene alluvium derived from post-Pleistocene backfilling of streams upon which
younger soils of alluvial origin, such as soils of the Voss series have developed (Aronow,
cited in Wheeler 1976:43-45; Carson, cited in Ensor et al. 2004). The Holocene
topography of the area surface also continues to be altered by the post-depositional
processes described by Aronow above, as well as by anthropogenic processes.

SOILS
The vicinity of proposed project area contains soils consisting primarily of
Bissonnet very fine sandy loam (Bn), Hatliff loam (Hf), Hockley fine sandy loam (HoB),
Voss soils (Vs), and Wockley fine sandy loam (Wo). Descriptions of these soils are
taken from Wheeler et al (1976).
Bissonnet very fine sandy loam (Bn) is a nearly level soil found in irregularly
shaped timbered areas that have smooth boundaries. The surface layer is composed of a
15.24-centimeter (6-inch) thick deposit of dark grayish brown very fine sandy loam. This
is underlain by 55.88 centimeters (22 inches) of brown and pale brown fine sandy loam
which transitions to a light brownish gray sandy clay loam. Following this is a stratum of
gray clay loam and light gray clay loam that extends to a depth of 177.8 centimeters (70
inches).
Hatliff loam (Hf) is a nearly level soil that formed in deep loamy and sandy
alluvial sediments along streams in forested areas. The surface layer consists of dark
brown loam to a depth of 12.7 centimeters (5 inches). This is followed by 12.7
centimeters (5 inches) of brown fine sandy loam with dark gray and strong brown
mottles. Underlying this is a stratum of yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extends to
a depth of 66.04 centimeters (26 inches) below the surface. Following this is a layer of
very pale brown loamy fine sand that extends to a depth of 96.52 centimeters (38 inches)
and contains few fine faint brownish yellow mottles and thin strata of brown fine sandy
loam. Underlying this is an 81.28-centimeter (32-inch) thick layer of very pale brown
loamy fine sand. The lowermost stratum, which extends to a depth of 203.2 centimeters
(80 inches), is comprised of very pale brown sand with brownish yellow mottles.
Hockley fine sandy loam (HoB) is a gently sloping soil found in forest areas and
pastures. It has a surface layer composed of dark grayish brown fine sandy loam to a
depth of 10.16 centimeters (4 inches). This is underlain by a 40.64-centimeter (16-inch)
thick layer of grayish brown fine sandy loam. Following this is a stratum of yellowish
brown sandy clay loam that is 60.96 centimeters (24 inches) in thickness with 15 percent
ironstone. This is followed by a stratum of sandy clay loam with red, yellowish brown,
and gray mottles to depth of 165.1 centimeters (65 inches) that contains approximately 25
percent plinthite.
Voss soils (Vs) are nearly level to gently sloping and are found on sandbars and
flood plains. The surface layer consists of dark grayish brown sand to a depth of 10.16
centimeters (4 inches). This is underlain at a depth of 10.16 to 152.4 centimeters (4 to 60
inches) by light gray sand in the upper 45.72 centimeters (18 inches) and very pale brown
sand in the lower 96.52 centimeters (38 inches). Voss soils are the only soils in the
project area likely to contain deeply buried cultural materials (Abbott 2001:table 3).
However, the integrity of deeply buried deposits is likely to have been compromised in
areas where the Voss series developed on Holocene alluvium frequently reworked by
high-velocity fluvial processes (Aronow 1992).

6

Wockley fine sandy loam (Wo) is a nearly level soil found in prairie and forest
areas. The surface layer consists of dark grayish brown fine sandy loam to a depth of
17.78 centimeters (7 inches). This is underlain by a stratum of brown fine sandy loam to
a depth of 55.88 centimeters (22 inches). Following this, to a depth of 83.82 centimeters
(33 inches), is a layer of brown sandy clay mottled with yellowish brown, red, and light
brownish gray. This is underlain by a stratum of light brownish gray sandy clay loam
mottled with light gray, red, and yellowish brown that is about 12 percent plinthite.

CLIMATE
Harris County’s close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico tends to influence the
temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Winds usually trend from the
southeast or east, except during winter months when high-pressure systems can bring in
polar air from the north. Average temperatures in the summer can reach well into the
90’s (degrees Fahrenheit), and are often accompanied by equally high humidity.
Although winter temperatures can reach into the low 30’s (degrees Fahrenheit), below
freezing temperatures usually occur on only a few days out of every year, and are
typically restricted to the early morning hours.
Rainfall is even throughout the year, with an average monthly distribution ranging
from between 43 centimeters (17 inches) to trace amounts; rainfall comes primarily from
thunderstorms (Wheeler 1976), which tend to be heavy but of short duration.

FLORA AND FAUNA
Present-day Harris County is located near the western edge of the Austroriparian
biotic province, and is situated in the Upland Prairies and Woods subregion of the Gulf
Coast Prairies and Marshes Region (Abbott 2001). Evidence from pollen analysis in
Central Texas suggests that, at least during the Late Pleistocene, the area may have been
populated by vegetative species that were tolerant of a cold weather environment.
Climactic fluxuation during the Holocene would eventually result in a gradual trend
towards warmer weather, similar to that seen today (Abbott 2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple,
and pine (Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually
transition to an oak savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time
would include currently present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller
game, as well as bison, and, in localized areas, pronghorn sheep and the American
alligator (Abbott 2001).
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of a
diverse collection of primarily deciduous trees and undergrowth (Abbott 2001). Modern
land alteration activities, especially those associated with agriculture, have resulted in the
removal of native plant species from the area. Identified trees may include water oak,

7

pecan, various elms, cedar, oaks, sweetgum, and mulberry, to name a few. Honeysuckle,
dewberry, yaupon, and blackberry are common, as are indiangrass and bluegrasses
(Abbott 2001).

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

The upper Texas coast is viewed by many researchers as a buffer zone between
cultural regions. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as
being an interface between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along
similar lines, both Shafer (1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic
archaeological record of this region as Woodland. This categorization is not meant to
literally invoke the exact cultural patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture
found to the east. However, as Aten (1984:74) states, “it loosely connotes activities by
populations on a geographic as well as a cultural periphery of the southeastern
Woodlands.” Under this framework, the prehistoric archaeology of Southeast Texas
represents a mixture of diffused technology and local innovation.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TIME PERIODS
Researchers have identified six archaeological time periods associated with
Native American habitation in what Perttula (2004:figure 1.1) calls the southeast Texas
archeological region. Harris County is included in this region (Hall 1981; Patterson
1995; Perttula, ed. 2004; Ricklis 2004; Story 1990). In general, these periods include the
Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on
the general framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal
boundaries of these periods.
For example, Patterson’s (1995) chronology includes Early Paleoindian (10,0008000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.), Middle
Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D.
100-A.D. 600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and
the Historic Indian (A.D. 1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a
Southeast Texas chronology that includes Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic
(8000-5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (5000-1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D.
400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750).
Perttula (2004:table 1.1) and Ricklis (2004:figure 6.1.1) provide a recent chronology for
the Upper Texas Coast that is also applicable to the Project area and includes Early
Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-6000 B.C.), Early Archaic
(6000-4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500-200 B.C.);
Tchula (200-0 B.C.), Early Ceramic (A.D. 0-700), Initial Late Prehistoric (A.D. 7001250), Final Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1250-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the
Early Historic (A.D. 1700-1800) periods. Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested that the
culture of southeast Texas is distinctive enough to merit a separate designation by the
Late Prehistoric. The “Mossy Grove” cultural tradition is a heuristic concept based on

9

technological similarities shared by groups in this region. The primary marker of this
technological tradition is the plain, sandy-paste Goose Creek pottery that is found in this
region from the Early Ceramic through Early Historic periods.
All of the chronologies developed by these researchers are based primarily on
changes in projectile point technologies and the introduction of pottery to the region
(Table 1). Despite their differences, it is also generally recognized by all these
researchers that a broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all
time periods up to and during early European contact in southeast Texas.
Within this chronological context, the oldest prehistoric sites in the southeast
Texas archaeological region are found near the coast and date to approximately 4,000
B.C. placing them in the latter part of the Early Archaic (Henson 2005). Unfortunately, it
has proven difficult to date many sites in the county. Those near the coast are shell
middens, which are difficult to radiocarbon date accurately and are largely Late
Prehistoric in age (Ricklis 2004: 201-202). In addition, numerous shell middens were
destroyed by Nineteenth century quarrying of shell for use in construction in the greater
Houston area (Henson 2005) possibly resulting in a biased sample. In Harris County, the
evidence of human occupation is fragmentary, particularly in the uplands where
archaeological data are derived largely from multi-component sites with mixed near
surface deposits. Stratified deep soils along stream valleys draining Harris County offer
the highest potential for finding prehistoric sites with data that will improve our
understanding of regional prehistory (Abbott 2001; Ricklis 2004: 201-202).

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Evidence is sparse for Paleoindian habitation; much of what is known about the
period in the area comes from a compilation of materials gathered from around the state
of Texas and across North America. At the close of the Pleistocene, large game hunters
crossed the Bearing Strait, and within a few millennia had penetrated into South America
(Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961). The Paleoindian people traveled in small bands
(Culberson 1993) and were mega-fauna hunter-gathers with the bulk of their meat protein
derived from mammoths, mastodons, giant bison, and giant sloths. These groups carried
with them an easily recognizable stone tool material culture, though admittedly, little is
known about their wooden or bone tools or their clothing types. Diagnostic points such
as fluted Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview points can be used to identify the Paleoindian
component of a site, and the nature of these points demonstrate the nature of the hunting
style. The above points are large and designed to be attached to a spear. No evidence of
bow and arrow hunting has been found associated with this period (Culberson 1993;
Newcomb 1961).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
With the retreat of the glaciers (the Hypsithermal period), the mega-fauna, upon
which the Paleoindian peoples depended, gradually became extinct. This shift in food
supply is seen as the pivotal transition point between the Paleo and Archaic periods
(Culberson 1993; Biesaart et al. 1985; Newcomb 1961). Culberson (1993) places the
beginning of the Early Archaic at 8000 B.C. Aten (1984) states that the transition from
Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric-Woodland began around A.D. 100. There are three
progressive stages recognizable during the Archaic period: Early, Middle, and Late.
Currently, research indicates that Early Archaic peoples were small, isolated
bands of hunter-gatherers that remained in relatively restricted regions (Aten 1984).
With the loss of the mega-fauna as a food source, the Early Archaic peoples adopted the
hunting of smaller game such as bison and deer and increased their reliance on foraging
(Culberson 1993). The material record fits the transitional makeup of this period because
there was a dramatic shift from the large spear points of the Paleoindian period to a
reliance on smaller “Dart” type points. Diagnostic designs for this period are Dalton, San
Patrice, Angostura, Golondrina, Merserve, Scottsbluff, Wells, Hoxie, Gower, Uvalde,
Martindale, Bell, Andice, Baird, and Taylor (Turner and Hester 1993). These points are
relatively crudely made compared with the Paleo precursors, but remain designed for use
on a spear shaft.
The Middle Archaic period saw the largest growth in technology and in the
number of stone tools used. Specialized tools appeared for the milling of wild plant
foodstuffs (Culberson 1993) along with a large assortment of tools for food preparation
and procurement. Gravers, scrapers, axes and choppers, knives, drills and polished stone
tools, also known as ground stone tools, began to appear in large quantities (Newcomb
1961). Diagnostic points such as Gary, Kent, Palmillas, Nolan, Travis, Belvedere,
Pedernales, Marshall, Williams, and Lange predominate the spectrum of dart points from
the Middle Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1993; see also the Edwards Plateau Aspect
[Newcomb 1961]). The advent of the atlatl also seems to be placed within this period
(Culberson 1993).
The Late Archaic period saw a dramatic increase in the population densities of
Native American groups. Human habitation of areas rich in diverse flora and fauna
intensified, as did the variety of materials and artifacts (Culberson 1993; Aten 1984).
Late Archaic peoples began relying heavily on foraging tubers, berries, and nuts and
hunting small game such as deer, rabbits, raccoons, as well as fish and shellfish, and
birds. Groups became socially more complex than earlier periods and the result was an
increasing intercommunication with neighboring groups. Culberson (1993: 55) states
that a “Lapidary Industry” developed in which stone artifacts were made from exotic
materials (jasper, hematite, quartz, shale, slate, etc.) acquired from sources great
distances away. These materials were fashioned into an increasingly complex array of
household goods such as celts, plummets, banner stones, mortars and pestles, and
pendants; also during this period there is an increase in the occurrence of sandstone bowls

12

(Culberson 1993). Diagnostic points of this period are difficult to distinguish from those
of the Middle Archaic. Gary and Kent points remain prevalent in southeast Texas, while
other points such as Marcos, Montell, San Gabriel, Mahomet, Fairland, and Castroville
also appear at times (Turner and Hester 1993).

LATE PREHISTORIC AND PROTOHISTORIC PERIODS
The transitional period between Late Archaic and Woodland-Late Prehistoric is a
period marked by an intensification of group dynamics across Texas. Turner and Hester
(1993) see the first signs of village sites in the lower Pecos valley as well as the
preliminary stages of Caddo development in the east. The advent of the bow and arrow is
believed by most (Aten 1984; Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961; Turner and Hester 1993)
to be from this period, though some place it later. Most importantly for archaeological
investigations, the first evidence of pottery began to emerge at sites from this period.
Although the amount and variety of pottery intensified during the Late Prehistoric,
pottery is an excellent way of determining the terminus post quem of a site. Fishing,
bison hunting, and the collection of wild flora intensifies beyond the level of the Late
Archaic period during this stage, but there is no sufficient data to demonstrate the initial
advent of sedentary agricultural. The diagnostic points of this period are Catahoula,
Friley, Alba, and Bonham (Turner and Hester 1993).
The Late Prehistoric (also known as Woodland and Ceramic Periods) continue
from the end of the Archaic period to the historic period brought in by the Spanish
Missions and Anglo-American settlers. During this period there is a shift to a near total
use of arrow points such as Perdiz and Scallorn (Turner and Hester 1993), and the
majority of groups had pottery. According to Aten (1984), approximately 18 different
types of pottery from this period are currently identified for the east Texas Coast based
on temper, paste, and design. It is during this period that peoples known today as the
Caddo, Atakapan, and Bidai, are identifiable both culturally and materially. This is
mostly due to the historical sources of the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries
that aid in the reconstruction of the past cultures in the area.

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
Present-day Harris County appears to have been an area of cultural diversity,
home to many Atakapan subgroups. Most of the groups near the north and west sections
of the county were associated with the Bidai. To the south resided Akokisa bands. Major
references to European encounters with the Akosisa (Orcoquisa) are found in eighteenth
century French accounts, and from Stephen F. Austin's colonists settling nearby in the
1820s (Newcomb 1961).
Harris County was formed as Harrisburg County on December 22, 1836. The
county was renamed Harris in December 1839 to honor John Richardson Harris, an early
pioneer who had established Harrisburgh in 1826, the first town site in the county. By

13

the 1830s Harrisburgh, which was established at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and
Brays Bayou, had become the major port of entry for the region as well as a significant
transportation hub. Roads ran northwest to the Brazos communities of San Felipe and
Washington, east to the ferry landing that crossed the San Jacinto, and west paralleling
Brays Bayou to the Oyster Creek Community near present day Stafford in Fort Bend
County (Henson 2005).
Under Mexican rule, the area surrounding Harrisburg (as it came to be spelled by
1832) was known as the San Jacinto District. The district stretched east from Lynchburg
on the San Jacinto River, west to the location of present day Richmond, and from Clear
Creek in the south to Spring Creek in the north. Harrisburgh County encompassed this
same territory with the addition of Galveston Island. The modern boundaries of Harris
County were established in 1838 (Henson 2005).
The lands that would become Harris County comprised the southeastern border of
Austin’s Colony. In July of 1824, 29 titles were granted to lands in future Harris County,
with an additional 23 grants made between 1828 and 1833. These original grants
concentrated mainly on the watercourses of the region. The early settlers in the region
were mostly from the southern United States who brought with them their African slaves.
In the 1840s, large numbers of German and French immigrants settled in Harris County.
The Hispanic presence in the region was relatively sparse prior to an influx of immigrants
following the Mexican Revolution reflecting the ephemeral nature of Spanish and
Mexican colonization (Henson 2005).
Late Nineteenth and early Twentieth century development in the area centered
primarily on agriculture and silviculture. The majority of the property associated with the
current tract was used for cotton and sugar cane production (John Breithaupt, personal
communication 2005). Ownership, and resultant land use, changed dramatically after the
1915 hurricane that hit the Galveston coast. Entire agriculture fields were lost as a result
of storm damage, and over the following years property usage came to be dominated by
timber harvesting, and, later, recreation. Felix Rafe, for example, owned approximately
16 hectares (40 acres) of land within the current Vintage property boundaries, and lived
on his tract circa 1920. During this time, Mr. Rafe operated a mobile Model T Ford
sawmill, which he used to process timber on his property. The remains of this sawmill
were present on the property prior to its sale to Compaq Computers, but have since been
removed by relic collectors. The fate of Mr. Rafe’s homestead is unknown; several
historic homes from the area have been relocated to Magnolia, Texas and other locations
over the years (John Breithaupt, personal communication 2005).
By the mid to late 1950s, severe modifications to the landscape had taken place
over much of the current tract. In general, several areas were clear-cut of timber, and the
property was maintained as a privately held game and fishing reserve (Litherland and
Marshall 2004), and Pillot Gully was significantly widened and channelized to improve
drainage. Specific to the area near Cypress Creek was the construction of a large
artificial lake during this time. This lake, which subsumes approximately 14 hectares (35
acres), was built by the Marshall family circa 1955. The artificial levee that had been

14

maintained between Cypress Creek and the lake was washed out by Hurricane Carla in
1961, but repaired shortly thereafter. It is not known where the soils to make these
repairs were collected, but pumps were possibly used to draw water from Cypress Creek
to refill the lake (John Breithaupt, personal communication 2005).
In the mid 1980s, ownership of the property was transferred to Compaq
Computers and to Hewlett Packard. The lake and adjacent property were in use as a
recreation area by these companies until the recent purchase of the property by the
current owners. Additional modifications to the property that have occurred circa 1980
include the deposition of a large spoil pile near or at the location of Mr. Rafe’s former
homestead and sawmill site (John Breithaupt, personal communication 2005), the
construction of Compaq Drive, and the excavation of various detention basins and water
wells.

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Site file research indicated that numerous previously recorded archaeological sites
are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current project area, and that several
more are located outside of this study radius along Cypress Creek. The majority of these
are listed in Table 2. Typically, sites along this portion of Cypress Creek are light density
scatters or relatively large prehistoric sites that have been subjected to at least some
degree of disturbance. Records indicate that these impacts have resulted from erosion or
modern disturbances from drainage improvement projects, pipeline construction, or land
clearing. Of those in close proximity to the current project area, 1 is a historic cemetery,
6 are prehistoric campsites, 15 are prehistoric lithic scatters, 2 are prehistoric artifact
scatters, and 2 are prehistoric isolates. Investigations have generally been limited to
survey level work, therefore the National Register status of many of these sites is not
currently known. A brief overview of selected research projects conducted near the
study area and along Cypress Creek is presented below. Sites 41HR344 and 41HR354
are located within the current project area, and are discussed in Chapters VI and VIII.
Many archeological investigations, primarily survey efforts, have been conducted
near the project area in response to flood control related projects and other public works
projects. In 1977, the Texas Archeological Society and The University of Texas at
Austin, conducted a reconnaissance survey of the Cypress Creek watershed in Harris and
Waller Counties. Portions of the 100-year flood plain were surveyed at the request of the
Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, in an effort to assess the significance of
archeological resources within the watershed prior to developing a predictive drainage
basin model. Fifty-eight prehistoric and 25 historic sites were recorded during the survey
of approximately 20 percent of the floodplain and selected upland areas adjacent to the
floodplain. Of the sites recorded, 23 were categorized as Late Prehistoric (Freeman and
Hale 1978).
In 1985, as part of a small survey prior to the construction of a road crossing
across Cypress Creek, Moore Archeological Consulting personnel attempted to relocate
the previously recorded archeological site 41HR525, several kilometers downstream from
the confluence of Pillot Gully and Cypress Creek. Originally recorded by avocational
archaeologists from the Houston Archeological Society, Moore (1985) determined that
much of the site had been destroyed by land clearing and erosion. Further testing was
recommended for the remaining portion.
In 1989, the Archeological Research Laboratory of Texas A&M conducted an
intensive survey of 261 hectares (645 acres) centered on a 22 kilometer (14 mile)
segment of Cypress Creek, approximately 15 kilometers (9 miles) northeast of the Pillot
Gully and Cypress Creek confluence. Four newly recorded sites were recorded during

the survey, including 3 prehistoric sites deemed eligible for the NRHP. Twelve
previously recorded prehistoric sites were revisited and 2 (41HR374 and 41HR375) were
determined to have possible subsurface intact deposits and recommended for eligibility
testing (Ensor 1991). In 1990, test units and backhoe trenches were excavated at both
sites, and it was determined that neither was eligible for inclusion on the NRHP (Ensor et
al. 1991).

Moore Archeological Consulting has conducted a number of surveys in the
Cypress Creek watershed. Most recently, south of the confluence of Faulkey Gully and
Cypress Creek west of the current project area, 20 previously unrecorded sites were
documented during a 52-hectare (129-acre) proposed floodplain preservation area. Three
known prehistoric archeological sites (41HR158, 41HR346, and 41HR793) were not
relocated during the survey, and it is suggested they are now possibly under dredge spoil.
Fourteen of the newly recorded sites were only minimally assessed, and no judgment of
site type or NRHP or State Archeological Landmark (SAL) eligibility was offered. Site
41HR967 was found to be destroyed by Faulkey Gully and Cypress Creek
channelization. Sites 41HR950, 14HR951, and 41HR954 yielded sandy paste ceramics,
however more investigation was recommended in order to access these sites. Site
41HR948 and 41HR949, although they yielded no diagnostic artifacts, were also
recommended to receive more in-depth investigations to assure a more accurate
assessment of their NRHP and SAL eligibility. One factor seemingly common
throughout these sites is their location within deep alluvium on ridges or sandy rises
(Porter et al. 2003), which seems to be the norm for sites within the Cypress Creek
watershed. An extensive list of archeological surveys conducted in the Cypress Creek
watershed by Moore Archeological Consulting can be found in Porter et al (2003).
Of relevance to the current project is a 1990 intensive survey of a 17-hectare (42acre) tract centered on Faulkey Gully approximately 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) north of
its confluence with Cypress Creek. Faulkey Gully is a larger tributary to Cypress Creek
west of Pillot Gully. No cultural resources were located during this survey (Ensor and
Moore 1990); further suggesting these gullies may have been poorly suited for prehistoric
occupation.
Most relevant to this undertaking, due to its similarity in location, was an
intensive pedestrian survey conducted by HRA Gray & Pape in the spring of 2003
(Schubert and Hughey 2004). The project area consisted of 40 hectares (98.8 acres)
situated along Pillot Gully. No cultural resources were located during this survey even
though the Cypress Creek watershed is known to have been an important locus of
prehistoric subsistence activities. The hypothesis put forth to explain the lack of
prehistoric exploitation of the Pillot Gully area was that prehistorically it was probably an
intermittent stream. Consequently, it would not have figured prominently in subsistence
strategies with a perennial water source, like Cypress Creek, located nearby.

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey was designed to identify and
assess preliminarily cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed project, as
well as to assess effects to cultural resources impacted by construction activities initiated
by this project. The methods employed during the eligibility testing phase of sites
41HR997, 41HR1000, and 41HR1001 were designed to assess the NRHP eligibility
status of these cultural resources.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the THC. Site file research was performed in order to
identify all previously recorded archaeological sites within 1.6-kilometers (1-mile) of the
project areas, and all recorded historic structures eligible for NRHP listing located adjacent
to the project APE. Site file research was used to provide a historic context to the
archaeological survey, and additional documentary research was conducted in order to
provide an understanding of the development and history of the APE, the surrounding area,
and southeast Texas in general. This research then was used to prepare an overview history
of the area, and provided an understanding of the contextual framework of Harris County’s
prehistory and history.
Additional information was gathered by conducting an interview with a local
informant familiar with the history of the immediate project area. The interview took place
within the project area, during which various points of interest were visited. General notes
regarding ownership and past use of the property were taken, and the points of interests were
marked on relent project maps. The results of this interview were used to guide additional
research at the General Land Office in Austin, Texas, the Houston Public Library, and other
archival repositories. Historic aerial photographs and United States Geologic Survey
(USGS) maps were collected, and examined for evidence of historic land use. These maps
and photographs were used to obtain clues regarding historic land use and condition, and to
reconstruct past land modifications.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN FIELD METHODOLOGY
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of cultural resources, prehistoric and
historic, within the defined project boundaries. These field methods also facilitated the
collection of data needed in order to determine whether additional investigations would

19

be required to evaluate the potential eligibility of any newly defined cultural resources for
inclusion on the NRHP or as a state designated landmark.
Archaeological methods employed during this survey consisted of pedestrian
survey augmented by systematic shovel testing. In areas where surface visibility allowed
for an examination of the ground surface (i.e. surface visibility greater than 30 percent), a
surface inspection of an area measuring 4 meters2 (43 feet2) was also performed at the
location of each planned shovel test.
Over much of the project area, shovel tests were placed at 200-meter (656.2-foot)
intervals along survey transects spaced no more than 30 meters (100 feet) apart. Linear
transects were utilized for the positioning of these shovel tests within the limits of the entire
project area. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas containing standing water or areas
of excessive slope (greater than 20 percent) or heavy disturbance. Areas near former or
existing watercourses, and areas determined during the site file and literature review to
contain a high probability to contain buried deposits, were shovel tested at 30 to 60-meter
(100 to 200-foot) intervals, depending on topography. Archaeological site delineation
was accomplished by excavating additional shovel tests in radial directions at 15-meter
(50-foot) intervals around positive shovel tests. Generally, 2 negative shovel tests in each
direction were used to delineate a site, unless landforms or evidence of prior disturbance
precluded excavation. When soils having the potential to contain deeply buried sites
were encountered, or when shovel testing suggested the presence of introduced spoil
material over high potential landforms, deep testing was conducted by using hand
auguring, trenching, or a combination of both. These methods are discussed below.
Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) in diameter and
were excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) into the underlying substratum
or until culturally sterile subsoil was encountered. Removed soils were screened through
1/4-inch hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard
terminology and the Munsell (1994) soil color charts. Additional information concerning
soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for each shovel test
excavation.

PREDICTIVE MODELING FOR DEEP TESTING
In recent years, models such as the Texas Department of Transportation, Potential
Archaeological Liability Mapping (PALM) system (Abbott 2001) have been used to
predict the likelihood of the occurrence of deeply buried intact cultural materials. An
understanding of the post-depositional evolution of the Lissie surface can help refine
these models and help predict the occurrence of deeply buried intact resources in the
vicinity of the project area. This project relied heavily on the results of several previous
studies (Abbott 2001; Aronow cited in Wheeler 1976, 1992) and more recent
geomorphological modeling of cultural resource distribution elsewhere along Cypress
Creek (Carson cited in Ensor, et al. 2004).

20

Carson (cited in Ensor, et al. 2004) conducted geoarchaeological investigations
for 2 projects associated with archeological surveys near the confluence of Cypress Creek
and Little Cypress Creek (see Ensor, et al. 2004:appendix 2). Carson described soil
profiles from a total of 8 test trenches in these project areas. Six of the test trenches were
placed in an area he defined as MAC-04-97 near the confluence of Cypress Creek and
Little Cypress Creek. The 2 additional test trenches were placed in an area he defined as
MAC-04-90 located slightly down stream of MAC-04-97.
The 6 trenches at MAC-04-97 were placed adjacent to channelized portions of
Cypress Creek up to 3 meters (9.8 feet) deep. Every trench revealed Voss soil profiles
without cutting into the underlying Lissie formation. The two trenches at MAC-04-90
were placed at least 50 meters (164 feet) away from the channel of Cypress Creek. These
trenches were shallower, and placed in areas higher on the landscape where soils were
mapped as Clodine loam. The latter trenches both cut into the Lissie formation at depths
of approximately 1 meter (3 feet). The Lissie was locally represented by dense mottled
silty clay loam containing “few to abundant clay-rich lamellae (Carson cited in Ensor, et
al. 2004:56)” and was detected in cutbanks at depths of 4 meters (13 feet) or greater near
the MAC-04-97 test trenches.
Carson (cited in Ensor, et al. 2004:66) noted that the differences between the soil
types and the depths to the Lissie at MAC-04-90 and MAC-04-97 were a function of
where the trenches were placed within the meander belt of Cypress Creek. He argued
that the MAC-04-90 trenches were placed along the edge of the meander belt where the
Lissie had not been eroded to great depths by fluvial processes. In contrast, the MAC-0497 trenches were placed within the meander belt near the modern channel.
In the same volume Carson also argued that the sandy Holocene alluvium within
which the Voss soils developed had been periodically reworked and redeposited by
fluvial processes throughout the Prehistoric period. These processes also extended to
influence development of sandy A-horizons in soils located along meander margins. The
latter were interpreted to be periodically scoured and redeposited by severe floods with
the net result being that prehistoric materials discovered in near-channel context were less
likely to contain intact Holocene archaeological materials. Carson provided additional
evidence for his hypothesis including the thickening of alluvium and corresponding
increasing depth to the Lissie formation as one approaches the channel, weak A-horizons
across the meander belt; and massive, sandy C-horizons near the channel of Cypress
Creek. He also used evidence of abrasion observed on a single potsherd recovered from a
trench placed near the channel to support the reworking of Holocene sediments.
Aronow’s description of local geology (cited in Wheeler 1976:43-45) also can be
used to support Carson’s model. Aronow noted that upland soils such as the Hockley and
Wockley series north of Cypress Creek developed on clayey Pleistocene alluvium of the
Lissie formation, while the Voss soils developed on alluvium resulting from postPleistocene backfilling of streams.

21

Knowing that “fat” clays mark the Lissie formation surface (Aronow 1992:5), and
that subsoils in the uplands contain such clays (see Wheeler 1976) the occurrence of
deeply buried materials is not likely in the uplands of the project area, as predicted by the
PALM model for the area (see Abbott 2001:table 3, figure 65). In contrast, the PALM
system predicts that the Voss soils mapped in the project area are likely to contain deeply
buried intact cultural materials (Abbott 2001:table 3, figure 65). However, Carson’s
work (cited in Ensor, et al. 2004) along Cypress Creek challenges this portion of the
predictive model.
The post-depositional processes discussed by Aronow (1992:5) have acted on all
of the Holocene and Pleistocene sediments upon which the soils in the project area
formed, since the time that the sediments were deposited. Therefore, predictions about
the integrity of cultural resources in the project area must be made after considering the
criteria discussed by Carson (cited in Ensor, et al. 2004) and the post-depositional
processes discussed by Aronow (1992:5). It was with these factors in mind that the deep
testing methodology for this project was developed.

DEEP TESTING METHODOLOGY
Deep testing supplemented ethnographic informant information concerning land
alteration, studies of maps and aerial images, shovel testing and other shallow zone and
surface investigations. It consisted of cutbank inspection, hand auger excavation, test
boring, and mechanical excavation of deep trenches. Deep testing was conducted in
stages in order to provide data on the presence or absence of deeply buried cultural
deposits within the project area, in order to determine the depth of archaeological
deposits when necessary, and in order to determine the likelihood that deeply buried
materials possessed integrity suitable for making an NRHP nomination. Great depth of
impact, and the high potential for deeply buried cultural materials led to the selection of a
three-pronged approach to deep testing for this project. The 3 complementary
approaches were cutbank inspection, test boring and coring, and backhoe trenching where
necessary. Additionally, a hand auger capable of reaching depths of over 2.6 meters (8
feet) was used to explore soil characteristics at selected shovel test locations. Auger tests
measured 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) in diameter. The process of excavation and the
treatment of removed soils were identical to that for shovel tests and information
concerning the auger tests was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for each shovel
test/auger excavation.
In floodplains and low terrace settings, water often cuts near-vertical scarps,
called cutbanks along stream channels that expose underlying stratigraphy. Such areas
often have little or no vegetation covering them, and offer opportunities for cutbank
inspection to evaluate the underlying soil profile.
Cutbank inspection associated with this project consisted of examining cutbanks
along Cypress Creek and its artificial and natural tributaries for slope, height above water
level, composition (e.g. soil, alluvium), erosional features (slumps, cutbanks), vegetation,

22

and cultural remains. In several instances the profile of a cutbank was measured, much
as one would measure a sidewall profile in an excavation unit. The scarp or cutbank was
scraped with a trowel or flat shovel, and or probed with the Oakfield probe, to reveal
underlying stratigraphy. Stratigraphy was compared with existing descriptions of local
soils and sediments (see Wheeler 1976).

Between April 18 and 19, 2005, a total of 23 engineering test borings were machine
excavated to depths of 1.5 meters (5 feet) in upland portions of the project area, and 10.7
meters (35 feet) closer to the channel of Cypress Creek. Project supervisory personnel
accompanied the test boring crew during much of the test boring process and examined test
borings for cultural material and soil-sediment characteristics. Data from all of the test
borings were used to reconstruct the local geomorphology and to assess the potential for
deeply buried cultural materials across the project area given previous investigations in and
near the project area (Aronow, cited in Wheeler 1976; Carson cited in Ensor, et al. 2004;
Wheeler 1976).
Test boring consisted of a combination of machine augering and push coring using a
3-inch diameter machine auger/cased core. Soil-sediment samples in 1.5-meter (5-foot)
deep test holes were obtained at depths of between 0 and 30.5 centimeters (0 and 1 feet), 0.5
and 1 meter (1.5 and 3 feet), and 1 meter to 1.5 meters (3 to 5 feet). Soil sediment samples
in 10.7-meter (35-foot) deep test holes were obtained approximately every 0.45 to 0.60
meters (1.5 to 2 feet). A fraction of the soil and sediment recovered from the test-boring
sample not slated for engineering tests was treated in a manner identical to that of soil
recovered from shovel tests and hand augers (see above). Stratigraphy was compared with
existing descriptions of local soils and sediments (see Aronow cited in Wheeler 1976;
Carson cited in Ensor, et al. 2004; SSS NRCS USDA 2005; Wheeler 1976).
The number and location of trenches was determined by observing soil samples
derived from engineering boring activities, auger samples and shovel tests excavated by the
field crew, and by consulting published geologic and geomorphologic resources (Abbott
2004; Aronow 1992; Barnes 1992; Wheeler 1976). Test trenches were designed for human
entry, and applicable standards adopted by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) and the Texas Health and Safety Code were observed.
Every trench excavated to depths of 120 centimeters (4 feet), or greater, was
evaluated by a Competent Person and classified as OSHA Class A, B or C. This was
done to determine if trenches could be safely entered for inspection. Samples of backfill
from trenches were either hand screened if sandy or loamy, or hand sifted if clay. During
excavation, the walls and floors of the trenches were monitored for signs of artifacts and
features after each approximately 10-centimeter (4-inch) “slice” of the backhoe’s bladed
bucket. The floor and walls of trenches were cleaned with shovels and trowels, and
inspected for the presence of changes in soil color or texture potentially related to the
presence of cultural features. One wall of each trench was profiled and photographed.

23

ELIGIBILITY TESTING METHODOLOGY
The results of the shovel test survey were used to guide the evaluation phase of the
project. Artifact counts were tabulated and used to create density maps. If a site was
suspected of having the potential to yield information important to the understanding of
prehistory or history of the region, then these density maps were used to plot the likely
locations of evaluation test units.
Test units measured 1 meter by 1 meter (3 feet by 3 feet) in size and were excavated
stratigraphically with arbitrary levels. Arbitrary levels were excavated in 10 centimeter (4inch) increments or until a new stratum was encountered. When a new stratum was
encountered the arbitrary level was terminated and the new stratum uncovered completely.
At each new stratigraphic break new arbitrary levels were begun and continued until
additional strata were encountered or until the bottom of the arbitrary level was reached. To
ensure that all buried cultural material was recovered from each unit at least 1, and, if
possible, 2 sterile levels were excavated in each test unit. Auger tests were performed in the
bottom of each unit to determine if any deeply buried cultural material was present below
these sterile levels. All test units were drawn and photographed in profile following
completion of excavation. Stratigraphy was compared with existing descriptions of local
soils and sediments (see Wheeler 1976, SSS NRCS USDA 2005). Cultural features were
photographed and mapped in situ and documented on separate unit feature forms.

LABORATORY METHODS
Generally, non-diagnostic artifacts were not collected during the intensive
pedestrian survey phase of the project; instead, attributes describing these materials and
their archaeological context were recorded in the field. On occasion, questionable nondiagnostics were collected. Diagnostics were collected during this phase, and all cultural
material was collected during the evaluation phase of the project. Initial processing of
recovered artifacts included washing and sorting according to raw material category and
provenience. Provenience was maintained throughout the process by the use of a
computerized field specimen log, which in turn generated an inventory of materials
recovered.
The initial steps in artifact analysis involved cataloging the assemblage. Data
recorded on each artifact include form, material, functional classification, manufacturing
technology, and attributes that are chronologically diagnostic. Material classifications are
subdivided to afford greater flexibility and detail of inclusive data. The attributes
category in the inventory provides additional information on individual size, condition, or
completeness.
In general, analyses of prehistoric cultural materials was conducted with the
following objectives: (1) identification of artifacts recognized as diagnostic of specific
cultures or time periods; (2) identification of reduction sequences represented by the
lithic debitage; (3) identification of utilized and/or retouched debitage; (4) identification

24

of raw materials represented among the tools and debitage; and (5) identification of
recovered ceramic types. A discussion of prehistoric artifact analysis methods is
provided below. Very little historic cultural material was encountered during the project.
Therefore, a discussion of laboratory methods associated with historic material culture is
not provided. However, a discussion of the historic material observed during fieldwork is
provided in Chapter VI.
Faunal materials recovered during this project were bone, most of which was
fragmentary, and less than 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) in length. The bone recovered is
consistent with the density of mammal bone and not reptiles, avians or other animal
classes. It should also be noted that an effort was made to determine if bone had been
heated or burned.

PREHISTORIC CERAMIC ANALYSIS
For the purposes of the ceramic analysis, sherds that could be glued together were
counted as 1 sherd. Any sherds less than 4 square centimeters in size were excluded from
detailed descriptive analysis although temper and surface treatment were recorded for these
specimens along with Munsell color if warranted. All rims and decorated sherds were
described in detail and analyzed. The ceramic analysis included examination of each sherd
under a 10x lens bent-arm magnifying glass to identify attributes of paste and temper. The
percentage of the primary temper, and secondary and tertiary inclusions were determined
with the primary temper generally being greater than 50 percent. Sherd thickness (body,
neck, shoulder, basal, and lip) was measured in millimeters using calipers for all rims and
sheds larger than 4cm2. As previously stated sherd color designations were made using a
Munsell color chart. Assessments were made as to the degree of firing displayed by the
compactness or friability of each sherd.
The sherds were further sorted into ware groups that were similar with respect to
attributes of paste and temper type. Within each ware group, there were several different
categories that were differentiated from one another based upon attributes of surface
treatment.
Prehistoric Ceramic Terms
Apparent porosity: the percentage of open pore space in a clay body.
Assemblage: an archaeologist's grouping of artifacts (such as pottery) from a site by form
and function, assumed to represent the material culture of a single occupation or cultural
episode.
Attribute: a feature or characteristic of style, form, or technology of an artifact that serves
the basis for analysis; also called a variable. Examples of attributes applied to ceramic
assemblages include temper type, surface treatment, and vessel form.

25

Base: the underside of a vessel, or that part of a vessel in contact with the surface it rests on
during normal use.
Body: that portion of the vessel between the orifice and base.
Burnish: to polish the surface of a vessel before firing.
Carbon streak: a black or gray zone in the interior cross-section of a vessel wall, usually
associated with incomplete removal of carbonaceous matter from the clay during relatively
low-temperature firing.
Clay: a very fine-grained earth that develops plasticity when mixed with water; also used as
a particle size designation.
Coil fracture: a smooth-edged circumferential breakage characteristic of coiled vessels in
which the coils were poorly bonded.
Earthenware: a glazed or unglazed non-vitreous ceramic material, usually lowfired, porous,
permeable, and red or brown in color.
Firecloud: a carbon stain on a vessel's surface resulting from uneven firing; characteristic of
firings in which fuel and vessels are in immediate proximity.
Grit: crushed rock used as a type of temper.
Grog: crushed or ground fired clay used as a type of temper.
Lip: the edge or margin of the orifice of a vessel.
Neck: the part of the vessel between the shoulder and the rim, typically characterized by a
marked constriction of the maximum body diameter.
Orifice: the mouth or opening of a vessel.
Paint: a pigmented solution applied to a vessel after it has been fired.
Paste: a clay or mixture of clay and added materials.
Rim: the area between the lip or margin and the side wall or neck of a vessel.
Sherd: a term archaeologists use to refer to a broken fragment of pottery.
Sherdlet: a sherd fragment that is too small or eroded for analysis or classification.
Shoulder: the upper part of the body of a restricted vessel; that portion between the
maximum diameter and the orifice or neck.

26

Slip: a fluid suspension of fine clay and water, often including a pigment, used to coat a
body before firing.
Temper: a mineral or organic material added to a clay to improve its working, drying, and
firing properties.
Variable: see attribute.
Void: empty spaces left in a clay body when particles of temper are leached or carbonized
from the clay.

PREHISTORIC LITHIC ANALYSIS
In order to analyze the lithic assemblage, a group of variables was formulated
comprising a series of attributes that describes specific aspects of the flaking
terminology. These variables were developed in a hierarchical fashion with an initial
sorting of artifacts into major classes (e.g., retouched pieces and debitage). The tools
were further subdivided into subclasses, including bifaces/performs, projectile points,
scrapers, and miscellaneous tools. The debitage was divided into unretouched and
retouched flakes.
The categories used to describe biface reduction follow in a broad sense those
proposed by Newcomer (1971), Callahan (1979), and Bradley and Sampson (1986). It
should be noted, however, that rigid schemes of reduction such as those cited, which
break up into stages a process that is in fact an unbroken continuum from raw material
selection to the final abandonment of the tool, can only approximate the course of a
manufacturing trajectory used by prehistoric knappers.
Prehistoric artifacts are sorted by artifact type, for example projectile point, based
on standard references such as Turner and Hester (1985) and Justice (1987). Specific
descriptive terminology was based on Cambron and Hulse (1964) and Justice (1987).
Debitage categories are based upon classification schemes currently used by both
Old and New World prehistorians (Bordes 1961; Frison 1974; Tixier et al. 1980). The
first level of analysis involves separating flakes, cores, and fragments (shatter and
“chunks” of raw material) and listing the presence or absence of features such as cortex.
The flakes then are subdivided, as much as is possible, into groups that would more
specifically identify the reduction sequence to which they belong. When subdivided and
possible, raw material type is recorded. The following terminology has been applied to
the classification of prehistoric artifacts.
Raw material identification was accomplished using hand specimen description
relying on visible properties such as cleavage, texture, color, luster, and fracture (see
Luedtke 1992:63-77). Heat-treated materials were distinguished from fresh materials

27

using visible properties as well. Given the scope of this project, and the fact that all
prehistoric lithic raw materials in the Greater Houston Area were derived from secondary
context in alluvial gravels (see Abbott 2001) no effort was made to further distinguish
among raw material types, or to identify raw material sources.

Geologic and Materials Analysis Terms
Chert: Chert (also called jasper, flint, or prase) is a chemically precipitated sedimentary
rock composed almost entirely of cryptocrystalline quartz. It can also contain minor
inclusions of other minerals; and silicified fossils. Conchoidal "glass-like" fracture, high
resistance to weathering, and a Mohs hardness of 7 make it an ideal raw material for the
production of chipped stone tools (Foradas 2003).
Felsenmeer: Felsenmeer are geologic surfaces characterized by large and small boulders
of locally derived rock. Specific to the current undertaking Felsenmeer are residue of in
situ regolith (cherts and quartzites).
Heat-treatment: The intentional heating of certain types of chert in order to improve their
fracture properties thereby facilitating chipped stone tool production. Typically the
effects of heat-treatment are evident as changes in luster, texture, color, and fracture
(Luedtke 1992).
Jasper: A variant of chert that commonly forms along fracture surfaces and is typically
yellow, or brown in color (Luedtke 1992).
Liesegang Rings: Liesegang rings are concentric rings of differentiating color and texture
that are formed during chert or other mineral diagenesis. Often, Liesegang rings are
clearly visible in large nodules of chert.
Oolites: Oolites are small (.25 millimeters to 2 millimeters) concentrically layered,
spherical grains within the parent rock, composed primarily of carbonate materials or
replacement phases. Oolites form where gentle or periodic wave action in warm marine
waters allows carbonate precipitation on all sides of a grain of sand or shell fragment.
Otswald Ripening: Identified by Wilhelm Otswald in 1896, this refers to system of
crystallization, in which many small crystals are formed initially, but slowly disappear at
the expense of larger crystals. The smaller crystals act as nutrients and fuel for the larger
crystals. The process is spontaneous due to larger crystals being favored energetically and
thermodynamically than smaller ones. During this process, concentric Liesegang Rings
are often formed. These rings often appear as a “bulls eye” pattern around the center of
the nodule. They are frequently seen in nodules of cherts such as Wyandotte.
Vug: A vug is a void or pore in a rock that is commonly lined with mineral precipitates.
Vugs frequently occur in cherts and geodes.

Debitage Terms
Angular Shatter: Shatter can either be produced during the knapping process or through
natural agents. Naturally occurring shatter is usually the result of a thermal action
shattering a block of chert. During debitage, shatter can result from an attempt to flake a
piece of chert with internal flaws and fracture lines. For the purposes of the current
undertaking, shatter is defined as a piece of chert that shows no evidence of being
humanly struck, but may nonetheless be a waste product from a knapping episode.
Generally, shatter is angular or blocky in form.
Blank: When a flake is detached from a block of raw material it may be regarded as
waste, utilized without modification, or used as a “blank” to be retouched into a tool (e.g.
a scraper or denticulate).
Broken Flake Fragments or Flake Shatter: Quite often, the force of the hammer during
debitage results in the breaking of the flake in one or more pieces. The result is proximal,
mesial, or distal fragments of debitage that are not angular, and often show previous flake
removal scars on their dorsal surface. These characteristics distinguish flake shatter from
angular shatter. Flake shatter is a common occurrence in percussion debitage but can
occur at any time in the knapping process.
Chip: This term, introduced by Newcomer and Karlin (1987), describes tiny flakes (<1
cm in length) that are detached during several different types of manufacturing
trajectories. First, they can result from the preparation of a core or biface edge by
abrasion, a procedure that strengthens the platform prior to the blow of the hammer.
During biface manufacture, chips are detached when the edge is “turned” and a platform
is created in order to remove longer, more invasive flakes. Tiny flakes of this type are
also removed during the manufacture of tools like end-scrapers.
Core: A core is a block of raw material, other than a biface preform, from which flakes
have been detached. Cores may be produced by careful preparation or may consist of a
block of material from which only a few flakes have been detached.
Debitage: The French term debitage has two related meanings: 1) it refers to the act of
intentionally flaking a block of raw material to obtain its products, and 2) it refers to
those products themselves. Commonly, the term debitage is used by prehistorians to
describe flakes, which have not been modified by secondary retouch and made into tools.
Flake: A flake is a product of debitage that has a length/width ratio of 1:1 (de Sonneville
Bordes 1960). In this report there are two separate categories of flakes and the first is for
those pieces to which a specific reduction sequence cannot be assigned. With these
pieces it is impossible to tell whether they have been detached during simple core
reduction or biface manufacture. For example, cortical flakes initially removed from a
block of raw material can appear similar in both core and biface reduction.

29

Initial Reduction Flakes: These debitage are typically thick, have cortex on the majority
of their dorsal surfaces, and have large plain or simply faceted butts. There are relatively
few dorsal scars. Initial reduction flakes may show removals from the opposite edge of
the biface.
Janus flake: These are a debitage type produced during the initial reduction of a flake
blank (Tixier et al. 1980). The removal of a flake from the ventral surface of a larger
flake results in a flake the dorsal surface of which is completely or partially composed of
the ventral surface of the larger flake blank.
Marginal and non-marginal flaking (c.f. Bradley and Samson 1986): These terms denote
two techniques of delivering the force of the hammer to detach a flake from a core or
biface. Marginal flaking involves the delivery of the blow of the percussor close to the
edge of the piece being flaked. As the blow is close to the edge of the striking platform,
the resulting flake has a small, narrow butt. Non-marginal flaking involves the delivery of
the blow at a point some distance from the edge of the flaked piece. Debitage detached in
this manner often have large, wide butts.
Microdebitage: Is small, > 5 millimeter debitage that is the result of platform abrasion or
retouch (incidental and/or intentional). This debitage class is often not recovered on
archaeological sites due to sampling biases, however, this debitage class can be produced
in great quantities when manufacturing stone tools.
Percussion and pressure flaking: In the case of flintknapping, percussion flaking
involves the use of a hammer or percussor to strike a piece of chert in order to detach a
flake. This hammer can be of a relatively hard material, such as a quartzite hammerstone,
or a softer organic material such as a deer antler. Direct percussion is a flaking
technique, which involves the delivery of the blow directly on to the striking platform,
while indirect percussion utilizes an intermediary or “punch.” Pressure flaking, as
suggested by the name, involves the chipping of stone by pressure. Flakes are “pressed
off” with the use of a pointed tool such as a deer or elk antler tine.
Platform abrasion: When the blow of the percussor is aimed close to the edge of the
piece being flaked (marginal flaking), it is necessary to prepare and strengthen that edge.
The edge is usually prepared by abrasion, which entails rubbing the striking platform area
with a hammerstone and detaching a series of tiny flakes (chips) from the surface where
the flake will be removed. Evidence of platform abrasion is usually clearly visible on
biface thinning flakes at the intersection between the butt and dorsal surface.
Unspecified Reduction Flake: These flakes cannot be attributed to a specific reduction
sequence and often have unidirectional or opposed dorsal scar patterns and often portions
of cortical surface. It is impossible to discern if this debitage class is the result of core or
bifacial reduction.
The groups of flakes that are a direct result of biface reduction are described as
follows:

30

Biface Initial Reduction Flakes: These debitage are typically thick, have cortex on part of
their dorsal surfaces, and have large plain or simply faceted butts. There are relatively
few dorsal scars, but these may show removal from the opposite edge of the biface.
Biface Thinning Flakes: These debitage result from shaping the biface, while its
thickness is reduced. These flakes generally lack cortex, are relatively thin, and have
narrow, faceted butts, multidirectional dorsal scars, and curved profiles. Thinning flakes
are typically produced by percussion flaking.
Biface Finishing Flakes: These debitage are produced during the preparation of the edge
of the tool. These debitage are similar in some respects to biface thinning flakes, but are
generally smaller and thinner and can be indistinguishable from tiny flakes resulting from
other processes such as platform preparation. Biface finishing flakes may be detached by
either percussion or pressure flaking.

Retouch Tool Terms
Biface: A biface is any retouched tool, partially completed or finished, which has been
flaked by percussion or pressure flaking over both of its surfaces (see bifacial retouch).
Bipolarized or splintered piece: A splintered piece (French piece esquillee) is a roughly
rectangular artifact, usually a broken flake or secondary source pebble, with bifacial
battering on opposing edges. The battering typically takes the form of scalar flake
removals that terminate in hinge fractures; these fractures are the result of percussive,
"bipolar" blows delivered on an anvil.
End-scraper: An end scraper is a tool with a rounded, semi-circular or squared edge
located at the proximal or distal end of a flake that is produced by retouch. A variation of
this type is the so-called hafted scraper, which is made from a broken and rejuvenated
projectile point, which creates a semi-circular edge.
Retouch: This term is taken from the French retouchèè and refers to the modification of a
block of raw material (biface manufacture) or flake by a single removal or series of
removals, thus transforming the piece into a tool. Retouch shapes the original blank and
can take the form of invasive bifacially detached flakes on a projectile point, or small,
tiny flakes on the edge of an end-scraper. Retouch also may be caused unintentionally
due to utilization; in this case, retouch forms as a result of an activity and not by a
process of intentional modification before use. Utilization retouch is typically
discontinuous along an edge. Retouch can be morphologically quite varied and the
following terms describe the various types and positions of retouch. The description of
retouch morphology on any given tool can, and often does, involve a combination of the
terms discussed below.
Direct retouch: Direct retouch occurs on the dorsal surface of a flake.

31

Inverse retouch: Inverse retouch occurs on the ventral surface of a flake.
Short retouch: Retouch that is short and produces small debitage such as those produced
when manufacturing tools such as end-scrapers.
Invasive retouch: Invasive retouch is generally elongated and covers a large portion of
the tool. Most often, this type of retouch occurs on bifaces or projectile points and can be
the result of percussion or pressure flaking.
Bifacial Retouch: Bifacial retouch is created when debitage is produced from two
opposing surfaces along the same edge of the tool.
Fine retouch: Fine retouch is characterized by small short flake removals that do not
drastically modify the edge of a flake. Often, fine retouch is the result of utilization.
Semi-abrupt retouch: This retouch type has a semi-abrupt inclination when the angle of
the created edge is roughly 45 degrees (Tixier et al. 1980:89). The angle is measured
from the chipped surface to the dorsal or ventral surface of the flake blank. Semi-abrupt
retouch is often seen on end-scrapers.
Retouched flake or piece: This category of retouched tool is represented by flakes, or
badly broken artifacts, which have limited amounts of retouch and are not standardized
tool forms. The retouch on these artifacts is highly varied in type, inclination, and
position.
Splintered Piece: A splintered piece (piece esquillee) is a rectangular artifact, usually a
broken flake or biface with bifacial battering on opposing edges. The battering is usually
manifest as scalar flake removals, which terminate at hinge fractures and are the result of
percussive blows.
Tool: For the purposes of typological description only, a tool is any flake that has been
shaped and modified by secondary retouch. In the case of biface manufacture, a block of
raw material may be transformed directly by retouch into a tool such as a knife or
projectile point. The term tool, therefore, is used only for descriptive purposes to
separate those artifacts that have been retouched from the debitage or unretouched pieces.
Finally, it should be recognized that the latter group of objects may well have functioned
as tools, for example unretouched flakes with good cutting edges are effective from
skinning and butchery, but this is difficult to determine without a microwear analysis.

CURATION
Artifacts recovered during field investigation are temporarily stored at the
Houston office of HRA Gray & Pape. All artifacts were recovered from property that is
currently privately owned. Therefore, following the completion of this project it is

32

anticipated that all artifacts will be provided to the landowners. If curation in a state
repository is required, artifacts will be prepared for curation according to state required
guidelines.
At the completion of fieldwork, the artifacts were appropriately cleaned and
allowed to dry. After identification, each unique artifact or group were placed in 4 mil
plastic resealable bags. Identification tags made from acid-free paper were placed with
the artifacts for future identification. Each tag contains the title of the final report, the
HRA Gray & Pape project number, an individual artifact number, full provenience
information, entire artifact description, processing date, and count.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN INVESTIGATIONS

Upon survey completion, each cultural resource loci was assessed as to whether
or not formal state recordation would be appropriate. In general, isolate non-diagnostic
lithic finds and sites with extremely low-density lithic scatters were plotted on project
maps and identified by field site or isolate number, but not formally recorded as
archaeological sites. Site trinomials were obtained for all diagnostic isolates and for all
sites for which some level of behavioral activity could be assessed.
A total of 504 shovel tests were excavated within the project area during the
intensive pedestrian survey, and 13 were positive for cultural material during this initial
effort (Figure 2). Each positive shovel test was assigned a field site designation based
upon the order of its discovery. A total of 8 cultural resource loci were identified during
the intensive pedestrian survey (Isolate 1, Isolate 2, Isolate 3, 41HR997, 41HR998,
41HR999, 41HR1000, and 41HR1001). An additional 35 positive shovel tests were
recorded during site delineation. Generally, during the intensive pedestrian survey, only
diagnostic artifacts were collected; these are listed in Table 2. See Appendix A for a list
of non-diagnostic artifacts observed but not collected. Each cultural resource is discussed
below.
Isolate 1, identified as a prehistoric isolate, was initially identified through a
single positive shovel test containing a lithic flake. The site is situated within a wooded
upland area approximately 400 meters (1,312 feet) north of Cypress Creek (Figure 2;
Plate 1). This site was delineated by the placement of shovel tests spaced at 15-meter
(49.21-foot) intervals radiating in cardinal directions from the positive shovel test. A
total of 8 additional shovel tests, extending to a depth of 1 meter (3.281 feet) were dug
during the delineation of this site, none of which were positive for cultural material.
State designated trinomials were not sought for this site. Additional testing was not
conducted at this site. Recommendations regarding this site are provided in Chapter VIII.
Isolate 2, identified as a prehistoric isolate, was initially identified through a
single positive shovel test containing 2 lithic flakes recovered at a depth ranging from 20
to 30 centimeters (7.87 to 11.81 inches) below the surface. The site is situated within a
wooded upland area approximately 30 meters (98.43 feet) south of Compaq Drive
(Figure 2; Plate 2). This site was delineated by the placement of shovel tests spaced at
15-meter (49.21-foot) intervals radiating in cardinal directions from the positive shovel
test. A total of 8 additional shovel tests, excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter
(3.281 feet) were needed for the delineation of this site, none of which were positive for
cultural material. State designated trinomials were not sought for this site. Additional
testing was not conducted at this site. Recommendations regarding this site are provided
in Chapter VIII.

Site 41HR997, identified as a prehistoric campsite, was initially located by a
single positive shovel test containing prehistoric ceramic fragments and lithic material
(Table 3 and Appendix A). The site lies within a wooded upland area approximately 100
meters (328.1 feet) south of Pillot Gully (Figure 2). This site was delineated by the
placement of shovel tests spaced at 10 to 15-meter (32.81 to 49.21–foot) intervals
radiating in cardinal directions from positive shovel tests (Figure 3). A total of 50
additional shovel tests were needed for the delineation of this site, 15 of which were
positive for cultural material (Table 4 and Appendix A). Prehistoric artifacts consisted
primarily of ceramic sherds and lithic fragments. All cultural material was recovered
from between 10 to 100 centimeters (3.937 to 39.37 inches) below the surface in a
stratum comprised of pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam. This site covers an area
approximately 100 meters long by 75 meters (38.1 to 246.1 feet) wide. Test units were
excavated in order to evaluate the National Register eligibility status of this site, and the
results of this testing are presented in Chapter VII.

Site 41HR998, identified as a historic homestead, was located through a single
positive shovel test containing a brick fragment. The site is situated in a wooded upland
area approximately 80 meters (262.5 feet) south of Compaq Drive (Figure 2). It is
adjacent to a large spoil pile, and is the suspected former location of the Rafe homestead
and Model T sawmill site, circa 1916. The remains of this sawmill were present on the
property prior to its sale to Compaq Computers in the late 1980’s, but have since been
removed by relic collectors. The fate of Mr. Rafe’s homestead is unknown, and may
have been removed at some time in the past.
This site was delineated by the placement of shovel tests spaced at 15-meter
(49.21-foot) intervals radiating in cardinal directions from positive shovel tests (Figure
4). A total of 25 additional shovel tests were needed for the delineation of this site, 5 of
which were positive for cultural material. Cultural material was observed from the
surface to 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) below the surface, and consisted primarily of
flat, transparent glass (Table 5 and Appendix A). This material was recovered from a
stratum comprised of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam that extended to a depth
of 1 meter (3.281 feet), but increased in clay content at depth. Additional cultural

components associated with this site included a paved brick area and a historic/modern
trash midden. This site covers an area approximately 60 meters (196.9 feet) long by 30
meters wide (98.43 feet) wide.
A single standing structure was identified during survey, and is thought to be
associated with the occupation of Site 41HR998. This structure, which was converted for
use as a pump house, appears to be a cupola from a larger structure that had been
removed and placed on the ground (Figure 4). Additional testing was not conducted at
this site. Recommendations regarding this site are provided in Chapter VIII.
Site 41HR999, identified as a prehistoric isolate, was initially identified through one
positive shovel test containing a single Early Triangular projectile point (Plate 3). This
Early Archaic point was recovered at a depth of approximately 45 centimeters (17.72
inches) below the surface. The site is situated within a wooded upland area
approximately 200 meters (656 feet) south of Compaq Drive (Figure 2; Plate 4). This site
was delineated by the placement of shovel tests spaced at 15-meter (49.21-foot) intervals
radiating in cardinal directions from the positive shovel test. A total of 8 additional
shovel tests, extending to a depth of 1 meter (3.281 feet), were needed for the delineation
of this site, none of which were positive for cultural material. Additional testing was not
conducted at this site. Recommendations regarding this site are provided in Chapter VIII.
Site 41HR1000, identified as a prehistoric campsite, was initially identified
through 5 positive shovel tests containing prehistoric ceramic fragments, lithic material,
and a projectile point (Table 3 and Appendix A; Plate 5). The site is situated on a terrace
located along the north bank of Cypress Creek (Figure 2). This site was delineated by the
placement of shovel tests spaced at 10 to 15-meter (32.81 to 49.21-foot) intervals
radiating in cardinal directions from positive shovel tests (Figure 5). A total of 20
additional shovel tests were needed for the delineation of this site, 1 of which was
positive for cultural material consisting of non-diagnostic lithic debitage. Non-diagnostic
artifacts were not retained from this site delineation. Cultural material consisting of
prehistoric ceramics and lithics fragments was recovered from between 30 to 100
centimeters (1.81 to 39.37 inches) below the surface in a stratum comprised of pale
brown (10YR 6/3) sand. This site covers an area approximately 120 meters (393.7 feet)
long by 60 meters (196.9 feet) wide. Test units were excavated in order to evaluate the
National Register eligibility status of this site, and the results of this testing are presented
in Chapter VII.
Site 41HR1001, identified as a prehistoric campsite, was initially identified
through 2 positive shovel tests containing prehistoric lithic material. The site is situated
on a terrace located near what appears to be an abandoned creek channel approximately
30 meters (100 feet) north of the confluence of Pillot Gully and Cypress Creek (Figure 2).
This site was delineated by the placement of shovel tests spaced at 10 to 15-meter (32.81
and 49.21–foot) intervals radiating in cardinal directions from positive shovel tests
(Figure 6). A total of 51 additional shovel tests were needed for the delineation of this
site, 16 of which were positive for cultural material. Cultural material consisted
primarily of lithic material and a small quantity of ceramic sherds (Tables 3, 5, and

Isolate 3, a prehistoric lithic scatter, is located on a small artificial island
approximately 100 meters (328 feet) north of Cypress Creek (Figure 2; Plate 6). The site
was identified in 2 shovel tests by the presence of 1 quartzite flake and 1 chert flake
recovered from between 90 and 100 centimeters (35.43 to 39.37 inches) below the
surface (Appendix A). This material was recovered from a stratum comprised of brown
(10YR 5/3) sand. If the two positive shovel tests are considered one site, this narrow site
covers an area approximately 60 meters (196.9 feet) long by 10 meters (32.81 feet) wide,
and is situated between a disturbed pipeline right of way and the edge of the artificial
island. State designated trinomials were not sought for this site. Additional testing was
not conducted at this site. Recommendations regarding this site are provided in Chapter
VIII.

PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED CULTURAL RESOURCES
Two previously identified cultural resources are located within the project area:
41HR344 and 41HR354 (Figure 1). Site 41HR344, described as a prehistoric lithic
scatter, was identified on the surface along the north bank of Cypress Creek. When first
identified the site consisted of 2 petrified wood bifaces and 1 worked chert fragment.
The original context of this material is unknown, as the area had been heavily disturbed
by dredging and creek bank channelization prior to the discovery of the artifacts. Shovel
testing to 1 meter (3.281 feet) and surface/cutbank inspection were conducted in an
attempt to relocate this site. These efforts failed to yield any additional artifacts.
Site 41HR354, a prehistoric isolate, was identified at the surface near an animal
burrow. It consisted of an interior pressure flake. The site was originally recorded as
being located southwest of the confluence of Pillot Gully and Cypress Creek within an
area of spoil material. An attempt was made to relocate this site through both
surface/cutbank inspection and subsurface testing. However, no additional cultural
material was identified in the vicinity of this site. State records on this site may be in
error since the site description and the location of the site as plotted on the Atlas do not
agree. The exact location of this site is not known, however, it should either be

associated with Site 41HR1001, which was identified near the area during survey, or it
has been destroyed by erosion or channalization.

RESULTS OF DEEP TESTING
Deep testing consisted of the measurement of 2 cutbanks along Cypress Creek,
and the excavation of 23 test borings, 3 trenches, and 4 augers at various locations in the
project area. The location of deep tests is shown in Figure 2, and a summary of
observations in deep tests is presented in Table 7.
The area around many test borings and trenches was covered in dense forest and
understory vegetation that was cleared with a tractor or backhoe prior to excavation of the
test cores and trenches. The clearing process was monitored by an archaeologist, and the
entire surface of the cleared areas leading to boring and trenching sites was inspected for
artifacts using close interval pedestrian survey methods. No cultural materials were
detected in surface disturbances caused by drilling machinery and the backhoe.

CUTBANK INSPECTION
During pedestrian survey and setup for deep testing, the west bank of Cypress
Creek, and the banks of Pilot Gully and other drainages in the project area were
inspected. Surface evidence of extensive disturbance to the bank of Cypress Creek below
its confluence with Pilot Gully was discovered. This included large blocks of cement
riprap, and what appeared to be pushpiles along the stream bank. The riprap and
landscaping of the riverbank and levee extended from the mouth of Pilot Gully to the
bridge downstream from Test Boring CB-14 at the project’s southeast boundary.
Apparently, the disturbance of the area is due to efforts to repair the 1961 breech in the
levee, and to stabilize the left bank of Cypress Creek so that it does not undercut the
artificial lake. Test borings along the levee and subsequent placement of a test trench
there confirmed this (see below/ Table 7).

CUTBANK 1
Cutbank 1 was measured along the west bank of Cypress Creek, 60 meters (197
feet) downstream (east) of the pipeline crossing Pilot Gully and south of Site 41HR1000.
The soil exposed in the cutbank profile was a Voss series soil exhibiting typical A-C-C
horizonation (see Wheeler 1976:23,57,sheet 31; SSS NRCS USDA 2005). The thickness
of the Voss pedon was approximately 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) thick. The A-horizon was
weakly developed, but along with the upper C-horizons it was typical for the series (see
Wheeler 1976:23,57,sheet 31; SSS NRCS USDA 2005). The basal C-horizon was
underlain alluvium composed of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand.

CUTBANK 2
Cutbank 2 was measured along the left bank of Cypress Creek, 75 meters (246
feet) downstream (east) of the pipeline crossing Pilot Gully and southeast of Site
41HR1000. The soil exposed in the cutbank profile was a Voss series soil exhibiting
typical A-C-C horizonation (see Wheeler 1976:23,57,sheet 31; SSS NRCS USDA 2005).
The thickness of the Voss soil at this location was approximately 1.5 meters (5.0 feet). It
was underlain by a sequence of thick sands interbedded with thin clay lenses (Figure 7).
The first clay lens was reached at a depth of 2.36 meters (7.7 feet) and may represent the
top of the Lissie formation or early Holocene fluvial facies.

RESULTS FROM TEST BORINGS
A total of 23 test borings labeled CB-1 through CB-23 were placed across the
project area by Tolunay-Wong Engineers, Inc. as part of an engineering assessment
(Tolunay-Wong Project No. 05-G111). Test borings CB-1, CB-2, CB-3, CB-4, CB-5,
CB-6, CB-7, CB-15, CB-16, CB-17, CB-22 and CB-23 were shallow test borings drilled
to a depth of 1.52 meters (5 feet). The remaining 11 test borings were drilled to a depth
of 10.67 meters (35 feet).
Archaeological project supervisory personnel accompanied the test boring crew
for much of this process and examined the soil and sediment removed from the cores, and
data regarding the test borings provided by Tolunay-Wong Engineers, Inc. Results from
test borings were used to assess the need for deep testing across the project area.

Results from Shallow Test Borings
Test borings CB-1, CB-2, CB-3, CB-4, CB-5, CB-6, and CB-7 were placed in
upland areas west of Pilot Gully and north of Cypress Creek. Each of these borings was
1.52-meters (5-feet) deep and revealed Wockley soil profiles typical for the series (see
Wheeler 1976:23,58,sheet 31; SSS NRCS USDA 2005). The A- and E-horizons
observed in these borings were represented by tan silty sand 31 to 62 centimeters (1 to 2
feet) in thickness. This was underlain by clays and sandy clays typical of the Btc and
Btcv-horizons of Wockley series soils.
Test borings CB-15, CB-16, CB-17, CB-22 and CB-23 were placed in upland
areas near drainages east of Pilot Gully and north of Cypress Creek (Figure 2). Each of
these borings was 1.52 meters (5 feet) deep. Test Borings CB-15 and CB-16 were placed
bordering the bank of Pilot Gully. Test Borings CB-22 and CB-23 were placed in the
northeastern portion of the project area, well away from water sources. All 4 test borings
revealed Hockley soil profiles typical for the series (see Wheeler 1976:16-17,52,sheet 31;
SSS NRCS USDA 2005). The Ap-horizons observed in these 4 borings were
approximately 31 centimeters (1 foot) thick and varied in texture from silty sand to sandy
clay. Bt- and Btcv-horizons observed in the borings also were typical for the series, and
several thin sand pockets were encountered in the subsoils.

Figure 7

Test Boring CB-17 revealed a sandier Voss series soil profile (see Wheeler
1976:23,57,sheet 31; SSS NRCS USDA 2005). This was not unexpected given the test
boring’s location along the sloping right bank of an intermittent tributary drainage of
Cypress Creek, north of Site 41HR1000. Given the location of this test within an
intermittent drainage, deep testing was not warranted at this location.
Since the E horizons in Hockley and Wockley soils were often absent, or thinner
than typical, and the topsoils was generally sandy, this suggested the areas mapped as
Wockley and Hockley soils had been plowed to the base of the underlying Bt horizon.
Since both Hockley and Wockley soils are typical of shallow residual soils developed on
loamy sediments of Pleistocene age (Abbot 2001; Aronow 1992; Wheeler 1976), the base
of Holocene soils was placed at the upper Bt-horizons and deep trenching for areas
mapped with Hockley and Wockley series soils was not warranted. No artifacts were
detected in any of the test borings, and the only anthropogenic disturbances to the soil
profile were the apparent Ap-horizons that had resulted from mixing and erosion of A
and E horizons in Hockley soils.

Results From Deep Borings
Test borings CB-8 and CB-9 were placed west of Pilot Gully and north of Cypress
Creek, near the margins of the artificial lake (Figure 2). Both were placed in areas
mapped as containing Wockley series soil, and revealed Wockley series soil profiles (see
Wheeler 1976:23,58,sheet 31; SSS NRCS USDA 2005) capped with at least 76
centimeters (2.6 feet) of recent fill. The Ap-horizon observed in these 2 borings was
represented by a tan silty sand 0.93 to 124 centimeters (3 to 4 feet) in thickness. This was
underlain by clays and sandy clays typical of the Btc/Btcv-horizons of Wockley series
soils. Below the Btc/Btcv-horizons, the borings appear to have penetrated friable
sediments of Holocene channel fill capping denser older alluvium of the Pleistocene-age
Lissie formation deposits.
The Ap-horizon observed in the two borings appeared to be derived from a
combination of cutting and filling associated with construction of the artificial lake. The
base of Holocene soils was placed at the contact with the upper Btc-horizon, which was
represented by light gray clay in CB-8 and gray clayey sand in CB-9. Trenching for this
area was not warranted, as it appeared that the pre settlement A-horizon was disturbed
and largely removed by cutting and filling associated with construction of the artificial
lake. This was also confirmed by the results of hand augers and shovel tests placed in the
area as part of the process of delineating Site 41HR997 to the west of this area (see
Figure 3).
Test borings CB-10, CB-11, CB-12, CB-13 and CB-14 were placed on the levee
between the artificial lake, Cypress Creek and Pilot Gully (see Figure 2). Test borings
CB-10, CB-11 (see Figure 8), CB-12 revealed Voss soil profiles characterized by A-C-Czonation, underlain by arenaceous Holocene fluviatile facies.

Test borings CB-13 (see Figure 8) and CB-14 also detected thin clay pockets
mixed with the fluviatile sands. Wood fragments resembling wood chips were detected
in association with coarse alluvial sands in cores CB-10, CB-11 and CB-14. The wood
fragments were recovered as deep as 9.1 meters (30 feet) below surface in core CB-14,
but were most abundant in Test Boring CB-11. Fine roots were detected in the clays
associated with the thin clay pockets mixed with the coarse sands. It was decided to
place a test trench near CB-11 to ascertain the origin of the apparently interbedded clay
and sandy alluvium (see below).
Test borings CB-18, CB-19, CB-20 and CB-21 were placed on the fringes of a
large detention basin excavated during the 1990s (Figure 2). Test boring CB-18, was
placed between the detention basin and the bank of Cypress Creek above the outside bend
of the meander on which Site 41HR344 is located. Test boring CB-18 revealed a sandy
Voss series soil profile (see Wheeler 1976:23,57,sheet 31; SSS NRCS USDA 2005)
composed of loose sand up to 1.2-meters (4-feet) thick (see Figure 9).
Test borings CB-19 (see Figure 9) and CB-20 were placed along the interior rim
of the detention basin (Figure 2). Both cores revealed Hatliff series soil profiles
exhibiting Ap-A-C-C zonation typical of the series (see Wheeler 1976:16,52,sheet 31;
SSS NRCS USDA 2005) in the upper 1.8 meters (6 feet) of core. The soil pedons were
underlain by sandy clays and clays that resembled older Pleistocene sediment seen in the
basal sections of cores placed closer to the channel of Cypress Creek.
Test boring CB-21 was placed near the base of the detention pond. The core
profile revealed a firm 0.62-meter (2-foot) thick clay pan that appears to have developed
from sediment lining the base of the dry detention pond bed. Below this was a sediment
packet similar to that in Test Borings CB-19 and CB-20, suggesting that the Hockley
series soil mapped in the area prior to detention basin construction (see Wheeler
1976:sheet 31) has been completely stripped away.

RESULTS OF TRENCHING
Based on the results of shovel testing, test boring, cutbank inspection, surface
observations, and ethnographic informant accounts, much of the project area with the
potential to contain deep deposits was determined to be disturbed by fluvial processes
and construction. As a result only 3 test trenches (Trenches 1, 2, and 3) were placed in
the project area. All 3 trenches were placed along Cypress Creek in soils mapped as
belonging to the Voss series (Figure 2).
Trench 1 was placed in the levee east of the artificial lake in order to test
hypotheses concerning the origin of the levee, and to confirm informant accounts about a

breech in the levee in the 1960s. The 2 other trenches were placed further downstream
on a low ridge northwest of the confluence of Pilot Gully and Cypress Creek and east of
the gas pipeline. This was the only part of the project area where potentially undisturbed
Voss soils containing archaeological materials (associated with Site 41HR1000) had been
found.
The area around all 3 of the trenches was covered in mixed deciduous and pine
secondary growth tree cover, and moderately dense understory vegetation. Vegetation
was cleared with a backhoe prior to excavation of the trenches. The clearing process was
monitored by an archaeologist, and the entire surface of the cleared areas around trenches
was inspected for artifacts using close interval pedestrian survey methods.

Deep Test Trench 1
Deep Test Trench 1 was oriented north-south and was placed approximately 5
meters (16 feet) east of CB-11 along the edge of a road on the levee (see Figure 2). The
trench was approximately 5 meters (16 feet) long, and 1-meter (3.0 feet) wide. It was
excavated to a depth of 3.4 meters (11.1 feet) (Figure 10). The trench was classified as
OSHA Class A for safety purposes and entered for inspection.
No prehistoric or historic archaeological materials were encountered during
archaeological investigations in the trench, nor was any evidence of cultural features
identified during trenching or in the trench profile.
The 2 upper strata observed in the trench were clearly road fill associated with the
dirt roadbed traversing the levee (see Figure 2). Underlying the fill was a series of lightly
colored sand sheets interbedded with thin lenses of dark clay extending to the maximum
depth of the excavation (see Figure 10). The strata in the trench were interpreted to
represent Holocene fluvial facies.

Deep Test Trench 2
Deep Test Trench 2 was oriented east-west and was placed along the ridge on
which site 41HR1000 is situated, but south of the drainage that marks the south boundary
of Site 41HR1000 (see Figure 2). The trench was approximately 7 meters (23 feet) long,
and 1-meter (3.0 feet) wide. It was excavated to a depth of 3.4 meters (11.1 feet). The
trench was classified as OSHA Class C for safety purposes and not entered for inspection
below a depth of 1.2 meters (4 feet) due to the high quantity of loose sand.
No prehistoric or historic archaeological materials were encountered during
archaeological investigations in the trench, nor was any evidence of cultural features
identified during trenching or in the trench profile. Bioturbation by coarse roots was

evident in the upper part of the profile, and animal burrows were observed in the vicinity
of the trench.
The stratigraphic profile of the trench is shown in Figure 10. The upper stratum
of the trench was classified as an AO horizon due to the high quantity of decayed leaf
litter mixed with smaller quantities of sand. Below this was an AC horizon and an Ahorizon containing minor quantities (less than 5 percent) burned nuts and roots. These
materials were inspected to determine whether or not a midden deposit was present, but
no cultural materials were detected. This area was interpreted by the field crew to
represent burning associated with historic or modern land clearance. The C-horizon
underlying these strata did not exhibit evidence of burning. It was underlain by an
approximately 2-meter (6.5-foot) thick deposit of laminated fine sand, with lamina
dipping southward toward Cypress Creek, and a mottled stratum of sands and silty sands.
The soil profile mapped in this trench was interpreted to represent a Voss soil developed
on sandy stratified Holocene alluvium.

Deep Test Trench 3
Deep Test Trench 3 was oriented east-west and was placed inside the south
boundary of Site 41HR1000 (see Figure 2). The trench was approximately 5 meters (16
feet) long, and 1-meter (3-feet) wide. It was excavated to a depth of 270 meters (11.1
feet) (Figure 10). The trench was classified as OSHA Class C for safety purposes and not
entered for inspection below a depth of 1.2 meters (4 feet) due to the high quantity of
loose sand.
During the trench excavation numerous prehistoric archaeological materials
consisting of pottery, debitage and several stone tools were recovered, mainly from the
screen. In contrast to the results of shovel testing in 41HR1000, no modern trash was
encountered in the trench excavation, and prehistoric materials were detected at shallow
depths as well as deeper in the trench. Bioturbation by coarse roots was evident in the
upper part of the profile, and animal burrows were observed in the vicinity of the trench.
These processes may explain the presence of modern trash detected deep in some shovel
tests.
The stratigraphic profile of the trench is shown in Figure 10. The trench profile
revealed a Voss series soil profile exhibiting A-C-C horizonation (see Wheeler
1976:23,57,sheet 31; SSS NRCS USDA 2005) underlain by older Holocene alluvium.
The clayey sand at the base of the trench exhibited mottles and iron concentrations that
could represent the upper Lissie surface in this area. A discussion of the prehistoric
materials recovered in the trench is provided elsewhere in this report along with the
results of other excavations at Site 41HR1000.

INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
The data from cutbank inspection, test borings, topographic maps and aerial
images (USGS 1982, 1995, 2002) supports observations about soil development in the
area, and the geomorphology of Cypress Creek put forth by Aronow (1992; cited in
Wheeler 1976:43-45).
Some of the hypotheses concerning integrity of deeply buried deposits in Voss
soils postulated in models of Lissie surface evolution and Voss soil formation put forth
by Aronow (1992) and Carson (cited in Ensor, et al. 2004) can not be rejected by the data
derived from test borings, test trenches and cutbank profiles examined during this project.
For example, comparison of cross-sections of soil and sediment in cores across the
meander belt of Cypress Creek at two locations in the project area indicates that these
models are valid. The Pleistocene-Holocene contact in the project area appears to be
shallow in the upland, and deeper as one approaches the channel of Cypress Creek.
Similarly, the A-horizons across much of the area are weakly developed, and the Voss
and Hockley C-horizons are massive and generally sandier closer to the current channel.
Furthermore, the sands observed in near surface test borings and trench profiles generally
exhibit a fining upward sequence and laminae indicative of higher-energy fluviatile
facies.
It should be noted that a red and gray mottled very firm “fat clay” and other dense
clays detected in the base of several test borings most likely represents the top of the
Lissie formation. The clay was detected at depths approaching approximately 10.05
meters (33 feet) close to the current channel, and closer to the surface in cores placed
further from the channel. This clay was also encountered in the basal Btcv horizons of
soils recovered from some shallow borings placed in the uplands. The fat clay and its
analogues are likely to mark the depth and breadth of the meander belt of Cypress Creek
in the project area.
Based on the topographic and core data, it would appear that the channels of both
Cypress Creek and lower Pilot Gully were broader during the Pleistocene. The sediment
between the top of the Lissie, and the overlying soils above it as one approaches the
channels, apparently represents the period when the stream channels were filled by
alluvium at the end of the Pleistocene, just as Aronow (cited in Wheeler 1976) described.
What lies above the Pleistocene-Holocene contact as one approaches the channel
is Holocene alluvium on which typical Voss soils have developed. The depth of the Voss
pedon rarely exceeds 1.5 meters (60 inches) in the cutbanks and profiles measured along
the north bank of Cypress Creek (see Table 6), and quickly gives way to what appears to
be reworked Holocene alluvium characterized by flow lamina and other indicators of
Holocene fluvial facies. In some higher areas within the meander belt, such as the low
ridges upon which Site 41HR1000 is situated, the top of the Lissie surface may lie within
3 meters (10 feet) of the surface (see Trench 3, Figure 10).
Alternating sequences of thick sands and thin muds (clay lenses) observed in
Cutbank 2, several test borings, and Trench 1 are typical of such Holocene and possibly
60

older fluvial facies. The clays in Trench 1 typically contained common fine roots, and
most likely represent periods of slow water flow, while some of the sands were laminated
and exhibited a generally fining upward sequence and are representative of periods of
greater stream velocity.
It was outside the scope of this study to determine if the roots with the clay lenses
were derived from aquatic or terrestrial plants, but it is highly likely that the clays were
deposited at times when water levels were shallow, and remained shallow long enough
for plants with fine root systems to become established. Similar conditions were
observed on parts of the modern stream where plants have established themselves on
sandbars in and along the channel, and at the base of the existing detention basin in CB21.
As a result of these observations it is suspected that cultural materials lying below
the base of Voss pedons (approximately 1 to 2 meters [3 to 6 feet] in depth) are not likely
to found in an intact archaeological context. This is because the basal C-horizons appear
disturbed by fluvial processes.
Similarly, tree throws, bioturbation by plant roots, and bioturbation by a variety of
fauna (e.g. insects, burrowing mammals, and birds) have impacted some of the shallower
soil horizons in the project area. In addition, substantial evidence of shallow-zone
anthropogenic disturbances by logging, agricultural practices, and construction, which
was obtained from analysis of historic and modern maps and aerial images, was also
corroborated by ethnographic informants, and various subsurface tests. These tests
detected Ap-horizons composed of plowzones and various types of fill on and near the
high bank of Cypress Creek, and riprap along its channel wall in much of the project area.
It should also be noted that the reduced likelihood of intact deeply buried deposits in the
project area is more a function of extensive flood control and drainage improvement
related construction than any channel-wide reworking of sediment such as that postulated
by Carson’s model.

CHAPTER VII. RESULTS OF ELIGIBILTY TESTING

Eligibility testing of sites 41HR977, 41HR1000, and 41HR1001 was carried out
in July and August of 2005. A survey grid was established at each site to control
horizontal provenience. Test excavation units were then placed in areas indicated by the
shovel test data to contain concentrations of artifacts. Additional test units were placed in
relatively lower-density areas within these sites in order to gather additional site
distribution data. The results of the eligibility testing investigations are presented below.

SITE 41HR997
Site 41HR997 was originally identified during the intensive pedestrian surveys of
Area A1 and A2. It encompasses an area of approximately 0.57 hectares (0.82 acres).
The site is situated on a small rise that is bounded on the north and south by wetlands and
to the east by the artificial lake that was created by the Marshall family in the late 1950s
(Figure 2). The area is heavily wooded with mixed deciduous and evergreen trees and
shows indications of having been logged and mechanically trenched at some time in the
recent past. Nine 1 meter by 1 meter test excavation units were placed within the site
boundary, based on artifact densities as derived from the intensive survey results (Figures
3 and 11). A total of 597 artifacts were recovered during evaluation testing. Two auger
tests were excavated adjacent to the site in areas identified during shovel testing as
containing lake construction spoil material in order to examine the underlying strata. The
results of these testing activities are described below (see Figure 12 for representative
unit profiles).

TEST UNIT N0 W11
Test Unit N0 W11 was located in the western portion of the site. A total of 15
prehistoric artifacts were recovered from this unit (Table 8). The majority of these
artifacts consisted of Goose Creek Plain sherds or small sherdlets exhibiting a sandy
paste (n=9). Debitage (n=6), created as a byproduct of stone tool manufacturing,
comprised the remainder of artifacts recovered.
This unit was excavated to a depth of 100 centimeters (3 feet) below datum and
two strata were observed in the profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer of 10YR 4/2 fine
sand that extended from the surface to a depth of approximately 20 centimeters (7.874
inches). This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 6/3 fine sand which was excavated to
a depth of 100 centimeters (39.37 inches). The lower 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) of
this stratum was mottled with 10YR 4/6 clayey sand. All of the artifacts recovered in this
unit came from Stratum II. Auger testing was performed at the base of this unit to a
depth of 135 centimeters (53.15 inches). No additional artifacts were encountered.

TEST UNIT N0 W25
This unit was located along the western edge of the site. A total of 56 prehistoric
artifacts were recovered from this unit (Table 9). The majority of these artifacts (n=43)
consisted of debitage created as a byproduct of stone tool manufacturing. Goose Creek
Plain ceramic sherds or sandy paste sherdlets (n=8) comprised the next most numerous
class of artifact recovered in this unit followed by stone tools (n=4) and 1 core.
This unit was excavated to a depth of 140 centimeters (55.12 inches) below datum
and two strata were observed in the profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer of 10YR 4/2
fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of approximately 15 centimeters (5.9
inches) below datum. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 5/3 fine loamy sand
which was excavated to a depth of 140 centimeters (55.12 inches).

All artifacts were recovered from Stratum II with artifact densities greatest at 100 to 110
centimeters (39.37 to 43.31 inches). A total of four stone tools were found in this unit. A
small chert Gary point was found between 45 to 50 centimeters (17.72 to 19.69 inches)
below datum. One diagnostic stone tool (San Patrice) and two bifaces were observed
between 110 to 130 centimeters (43.31 to 51.18 inches) below datum. The San Patrice
point, made from tan chert, measured 32.9 millimeters (1.295 inches) in length. Biface
fragment FS 3039 is broken due to bipolar reduction and is fashioned from an Oolitic
chert that is vitreous. Due to the fragmentary nature of this artifact, no quantitative
measurements could be taken. Numerous hinge fractures on this specimen suggest that a
large stack was present and that numerous thinning attempts were made before the piece
was reduced by bipolar means. The second biface was broken due to knapping failure. A
vug is located within the fabric of the chert and an attempt to thin a small stack resulted
in a flexion break along the axis of the vug. Both bifaces are in the earlier stages of
production. The method of manufacture is largely percussion and the specimens show
random flake scar patterns. Neither example shows signs of utilization. Based on the
aforementioned attributes it is concluded that both specimens were broken during
manufacture.
Auger testing was performed at the base of this unit to a depth of 1.9 meters
(6.234 feet) below datum. No additional artifacts were encountered.

TEST UNIT N15 W10
The unit was situated in the central portion of the site. A total of 113 prehistoric
artifacts were recovered from this unit (Table 10). The majority of these artifacts (n=80)
consisted of debitage created as a byproduct of stone tool manufacturing. Goose Creek
Plain ceramic sherds or sherdlets exhibiting a sandy paste comprised the remainder of
artifacts recovered in this unit (n=33). One feature (Feature 1) was identified within this
unit. It consisted of a dense concentration of ceramic sherds (Figure 13).
This unit was excavated to a depth of 110 centimeters (43.31 inches). Three strata
were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer of 10YR 5/2 fine sand
that extended from the surface to a depth of 12 centimeters (4.724 inches) below datum.
This was followed by a layer of 10YR 5/4 fine sand to a depth of approximately 55
centimeters (21.65 inches). This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 6/3 fine sand that
was excavated to a depth of 110 centimeters (43.31 inches). Auger testing was
performed at the base of this unit to a depth of 200 centimeters (78.74 inches). No
additional artifacts were encountered.

FEATURE 1
Feature 1 was identified as a concentration of prehistoric ceramic sherds
approximately 65 centimeters (25.59 inches) below datum (Figure 13). Because the test
unit bisected the feature, this material was left in situ and protected with plastic prior to

backfilling the unit. No additional cultural material or faunal remains were identified
within this feature. Despite careful observation during excavation, no discernable change
in soil texture or color was apparent that would indicate the presence of a hearth,
postmold, or pit in the unit wall profile.

TEST UNIT S1 E6
This unit was situated in the eastern portion of the site. This unit had the lowest
artifact density with only 12 prehistoric artifacts observed, (Table 11) all of which
consisted of debitage.
Excavated to a depth of 110 centimeters (43.31 inches) below datum, this unit
contained 3 strata. Stratum I, which extended from the surface to a depth of
approximately 20 centimeters (78.74 inches) below datum, consisted of a layer of 10YR
5/3 loamy sand with inclusions of 10YR 6/6, 10YR 5/8, 10YR 5/2, 10YR 6/2, and 7.5YR
5/8 sandy clay. This was followed by a 10-centimeter (3.937-inch) thick layer of 10YR
4/2 fine sand. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 6/4 fine sand that extended to the
base of the unit. Auger testing was performed at the base of this unit to a depth of 140
centimeters (55.12 inches) below datum. No additional artifacts were encountered.
Stratum I appears to be composed of dredge material that was likely deposited as
a result of the construction of the nearby lake. During the intensive pedestrian survey of
the area, similar surface deposits were documented adjacent to the lake. This stratum was
sterile for cultural material. Stratum II represents the original surface layer while Stratum
III appears to be equivalent to what was designated as Stratum II throughout other
portions of the site.

TEST UNIT N12 E5
This unit was located in the eastern portion of the site. A total of 20 prehistoric
artifacts were recovered from this unit (Table 12). These were composed primarily of
debitage from stone tool production; although 1 flaked cobble and 1 mammal bone were
also observed.
Test Unit N12 E5 was excavated to a depth of 110 centimeters (43.31 inches)
below datum. Two strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer
of 10YR 6/2 fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of 26 centimeters (10.24
inches) below datum. This stratum was partially bisected by a lens of clay dredge spoil
similar to that noted in the previous unit. This was followed by a layer of 10YR 6/4 fine
sand to a depth of approximately 110 centimeters (43.31 inches) below datum. The
lowermost 45 centimeters (17.72 inches) of this layer contained a dense concentration of
ironstone concretions. Auger testing was performed at the base of this unit to a depth of
160 centimeters (62.99 inches) below datum. No additional artifacts were encountered.
Artifact density was highest in level 6, which was between 50 and 60 centimeters (19.69
and 23.62 inches) below datum.

prehistoric artifacts were recovered from this unit (Table 13). These artifacts consisted of
37 debitage, 2 biface tools, and 5 sandy paste ceramic sherds. Artifact densities were
highest in level 5 (40 to 50 centimeters [15.75 to 19.69 inches] below datum).
Test Unit N27 E17 was excavated to a depth of 100 centimeters (3.281 feet)
below datum. Two strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer
of 7.5YR 5/3 fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of 26 centimeters (10.24
inches) below datum. This stratum contained a deposit of clay dredge spoil similar to
that noted in the previous unit. This was followed by a layer of 10YR 6/3 fine sand that
extended to the base of the unit. Auger testing was performed at the base of this unit to a
depth of 200 centimeters (78.74 inches) below datum. A third stratum was observed in
the auger test profile. It consisted of 10YR 7/6 heavily compacted fine sand that
originated at 146 centimeters (57.48 inches) below datum and extended to the base of the
auger test. No additional artifacts were encountered.

TEST UNIT N28 W3
This unit, along with Test Unit N28 W4, was positioned in the portion of the site
identified during the intensive pedestrian survey as having the highest artifact density.
Combined, these 2 units form a 1-meter by 2-meter excavation unit. Test Unit N28 W4
will be discussed separately below. A total of 111 prehistoric artifacts were recovered
from this unit. There were more artifacts as well as a wider diversity of artifact classes
than in any other unit (Table 14). Artifact density was greatest in level 6 (50 to 60
centimeters [19.69 to 23.62 inches] below datum) which had a total of 19 artifacts. All
artifacts were recovered from Stratum II. Two stone tools were found in this unit: a
projectile point distal end made of oolitic chert was found in level 8 and 1 petrified wood
biface was found in level 12.

TEST UNIT N28 W4
As previously discussed, this unit was placed in the area of the site identified as
having the highest artifact density. A total of 112 prehistoric artifacts were recovered
from this unit (Table 15). The majority of the artifacts were classified as debitage
(n=61), although Goose Creek ceramic sherds and sandy paste sherdlets (n=48), mussel
shell fragments (n=1), fire cracked rock (n=1), and unmodified raw material (n=1) were
also present. All artifacts came from within stratum II with the highest densities
occurring between levels 5 and 7 (40 to 70 centimeters [15.75 to 27.56 inches] below
datum).
71

Test Unit N28 W4 was excavated to a depth of 140 centimeters (55.12 inches)
below datum. Two strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer
of 10YR 6/4 fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of 30 centimeters (11.81
inches) below datum. This was followed by a layer of fine sand to a depth of
approximately 140 centimeters (55.12 inches) below datum. This second stratum graded
from 10YR 5/4 in its upper portions to 10YR 6/4 in the lower portions of the unit with
dense ironstone concretions at its base. Auger testing was performed at the base of this
unit to a depth of 200 centimeters (78.74 inches) below datum. During auger testing a
third stratum was encountered. This stratum consisted of 10YR 7/1 sandy clay loam
mottled with 7.5YR 5/6 sandy clay loam that extended from 190 centimeters (74.8

AUGER TESTING
Auger testing was performed in the area between the site and the artificial lake
(Figure 11). This area was identified as containing a dense mantle of dredge material
most likely deposited during the construction of the lake. Auger tests were performed to
a maximum depth of 2.7 meters (8.9 feet). Auger testing indicated that fill material in the
form of heavily mottled clays extend from the surface to approximately 80 centimeters
(31.5 inches) below the surface and was underlain by loamy, culturally sterile, sands.
This fill material is present in the areas adjacent to the lake and extends to just inside the
tree line. No artifacts or cultural features were identified within the auger tests.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The excavation of nine 1x1 meter2 test units resulted in the recovery of 567
artifacts from an area measuring 0.57 hectares (0.82 acres). These artifacts were
unevenly distributed with the highest concentrations observed within the northern half of
the site. Artifact frequency was highest within Stratum II, which accounted for 86% of
the total. Flake shatter was the most common artifact type (n=120) followed by pottery
73

(n=105), biface thinning flakes (n=87), biface finishing flakes (n=67), initial reduction
flakes (n=57), unspecified reduction flakes (n=34), projectile points (n=7), Janus flakes
(n=7), organic remains (n=7), biface initial reduction flakes (n=5), cores (n=3), chips
(n=3), fire cracked rock (n=2), flaked cobble (n=1), and unmodified raw material (n=1).
Artifact density was highest in units N15 W10, N30 E10, N28 W3, and N28 W4, which
were all, situated in the northern half of the site. These units produced artifact densities
twice as high as the other units.

Temporal Affiliation and Site Function
The majority of temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from Stratum II.
These consisted of 223 prehistoric ceramic sherds and 2 stone implements. The
prehistoric ceramics consisted mainly of Goose Creek pottery, which date to the Late
Prehistoric (Plate 7), or sandy paste pottery that was too small to accurately classify.
Interestingly, several sherds were made of a Goose Creek paste but exhibited smoothed
interiors and exteriors. A single decorated rim sherd was recovered, which exhibited a
combination of punctuations and curvilinear incising reminiscent of Caddo or Lower
Mississippi Valley (LMV) treatments. This sherd was too small to classify, but seemed
to follow Schambach’s (1981) observations regarding rim versus body decorative
treatments in the Felsenthal Region of southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana
(Rolingson and Schambach 1981: 107).
Only one test unit at this site, N0 W25, contained temporally diagnostic stone
implements. Diagnostic stone implements consisted of a small, contracting stem, Gary
point and a fluted San Patrice point (Plate 8). The Gary point was recovered during
screening of soil from Stratum I in level 6 of Test Unit N0 W25. This type dates from the
Middle to Transitional Archaic but is also found in Early Ceramic contexts (see Table 1).
It has been indicated that this type decreases in size over time (Ford and Webb 1956: 5254). The fluted San Patrice projectile point was recovered during screening of dirt from
the southwest quarter of the unit at the bottom of Stratum II in Test Unit N0 W25. The
San Patrice point, which dates to the Paleoindian period, was found in level 13,
approximately 70 centimeters (27 inches) below the level of the Gary point.
It is possible to determine periods of occupation for this site based upon these
data. The Gary projectile point, found within deposits containing Goose Creek pottery, is
indicative of Transitional Archaic to Late Prehistoric occupation. The San Patrice point
indicates a Paleoindian occupation. Ceramics were not recovered in association with this
dartpoint, and in general ceramics were only present in relatively small quantities, if
present at all, in levels 9 through 12 of all of the test units excavated at the site.
The artifact patterning seems to indicate a non-random distribution of cultural
material, which includes debitage produced as a result of stone tool manufacture and a
high proportion of ceramics. This suggests that the site was the locus of multiple
activities most likely associated with a seasonal campsite.

Integrity of Deposits
The diagnostic artifacts are found in contexts that suggest that temporally separate
deposits have not been commingled at this site. Older artifacts, as represented by the San
Patrice point, are overlain by more recent artifacts (Gary point and Goose Creek pottery).
This patterning suggests that the depositional integrity of this site is intact. Additional
evidence for stratification includes artifact distribution by test unit level. In several test
units, artifact count by level suggests a normal distribution, whereby artifact count
increases with depth, peaks between approximately levels 5 and 8, and then decreases.
Biface thinning flakes and biface finishing flakes, which are generally small and
lightweight and prone to vertical migration in soil, also tend to occur in higher frequency
within this cluster. The generally decreasing occurrence of pottery by test unit level (see
Tables 8 through 11) and the presence of more Janus flakes (indicative of larger biface
modification) also supports a hypothesis for coarse stratification of the site into shallow
(Ceramic) and deeper (aceramic) Archaic and Paleoindian components.
If the artifacts were in a secondary context in a colluvial or alluvial sand sheet,
one would expect a fining upward sequence with respect to artifact distribution. Instead,
a normal distribution is seen in cultural materials. These factors argue for a culturally
stratified deposit, partly impacted by bioturbation, but generally possessing integrity that
can be used to address issues of regional importance in prehistoric studies.

SITE 41HR1000
Site 41HR1000 was originally identified during the intensive pedestrian survey of
Area B2. It encompasses an area of approximately 0.39 hectares (0.60 acres). The site is
situated in heavy woods on a terrace along Cypress Creek. It is bounded to the east by
Cypress Creek, to the west by a pipeline ROW, and to the north and south by wetlands
(Figure 2). Four 1 meter by 1-meter test excavation units were placed within the site
boundary from which a total of 170 artifacts were recovered.
The positioning of these units was based upon artifact density data derived from
the results intensive survey (Figures 5 and 14). A single trench measuring approximately
3 meters (9.843 feet) in length and 1 meter (3.281 feet) in width was excavated within the
site in order to determine the depth of deposits, investigate for the possibility of features,
and to gather additional information regarding artifact density. A total of 193 artifacts
were recovered from this trench. The results of these excavations will be discussed below
(refer to Figure 12 for representative unit profiles).

TEST UNIT N0 E5
The unit was placed at the top of a landform overlooking Cypress Creek. This
area was identified during intensive survey as having a moderately low density of
artifacts. It was excavated to a total depth of 130 centimeters (51.18 inches) below
datum (Table 17). A total of 132 prehistoric artifacts were recovered and 1 cultural

feature was identified. The majority of the artifacts were classified as debitage (n=71)
although a high density of prehistoric ceramic sherds (n=53), a biface tool (n=1) and
indeterminate mammal bones (n=4) were present. Most of the sherds are classified as
Goose Creek Plain; however, three of the sherds exhibited a brushed surface treatment on
the interior, exterior, or both (Plate 9). Several others exhibited smoothed exteriors. The
highest density of artifacts came from level 7 (60 to 70 centimeters below datum [23.62
to 267.56 inches]) that contained a total of 30 artifacts as well as the upper portion of
Feature 1.
Historic artifacts recovered from this unit are listed in Table 18. One clear glass
fragment was present in level 7. This is likely due to bioturbation as tree roots and
animal burrows were common in the upper portions of the unit.

A total of 2 strata were observed in the test unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a
layer of 10YR 4/2 fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of 24 centimeters
below datum. This was underlain by a layer of 10YR 5/2 fine sand which graded into
10YR 6/2 in the lower extent of the unit. Auger testing was performed at the base of this
unit to a depth of 230 centimeters (90.55 inches). During auger testing a third stratum
was encountered. This stratum consisted of 10YR 7/2 fine sand that extended from 170
to 230 centimeters (66.93 to 90.55 inches). One flake was observed in the auger test
between 140 and 150 centimeters (55.12 and 59.06 inches) below datum.

FEATURE 1
Feature 1 was identified in the southwest corner of the unit at a depth of 69
centimeters (27.17 inches) below datum and extended for a depth of approximately 20
centimeters (7.874 inches) (Figure 15). It was roughly cylindrical in shape and
horizontally oriented. The feature matrix was composed of 10YR 5/2 fine sand with
numerous fine roots. Artifacts consisted of debitage (n=7), and prehistoric sandy paste
ceramic sherds (n=8). Mammal bone (n=5) and charcoal were also recovered. The bone
is not burned and very fragmentary but consistent with the density of mammal bone and
not reptiles etc. further some elements of long bones were present on two specimens.
Although inconclusive, due to the fragmentary nature it is suggested that these specimens
are mammal, likely white-tailed deer. Based on the materials recovered and its geometry,
this feature is interpreted as representing the truncated remains of what was once a larger
midden deposit.

TEST UNIT N15 W5
This unit was situated in an area identified during intensive survey as having a
moderate density of artifacts. A total of 30 prehistoric artifacts were recovered from this
unit. Debitage from stone tool production was the dominant artifact type observed in this
unit (n=29). Prehistoric ceramic sherds (n=1) were present in very low densities. The
unit was excavated to a total depth of 100 centimeters (39.37 inches) below datum (Table
19).
A total of 2 strata were observed in the test unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a
layer of 10YR 5/3 fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of approximately
20 centimeters below datum. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 6/4 fine sand.
Auger testing was performed at the base of this unit to a depth of 200 centimeters (78.74
inches). During auger testing a third stratum was encountered. This stratum consisted
of 10YR 5/2 fine sand that extended from 195 centimeters to 200 centimeters (78.74
inches). No artifacts were encountered in the auger test.

The test unit was excavated to a depth of 100 centimeters (3.281 feet) below
datum. Four strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer of
10YR 6/3 fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of 32 centimeters (12.6
inches) below datum. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 5/3 fine sand which
contained several large tree roots. This was followed by a layer of 10YR 3/1 fine sand
identified as a buried surface. Below this was a stratum of 10YR 6/3 fine sand which
continued below the bottom of the excavation unit. Auger testing was performed at the
base of this unit to a depth of 200 centimeters (78.74 inches) below datum. No additional
artifacts were encountered in the auger test.

DEEP TEST TRENCH 3
Deep Test Trench 3 was excavated in order to assess the potential for deeply
buried deposits and features within the site boundary. The trench was located
approximately 5 meters (16.4 feet) west of Test Unit N0 E5 (Figure 14). Table 22 shows
the artifact classes encountered in the trench. No features were encountered during the
excavation of this trench.
The trench was excavated to a depth of 2.7 meters (8.8 feet) into a Voss soil
developed on sandy alluvium. Six strata were identified in the trench, and all of these
strata are described in detail in Figure 8. Artifacts were recovered from the Ap-horizon
and three underlying C-horizons. The majority of artifacts (see Table 21) were Late
Prehistoric in age, and recovered from the base of Stratum II; the C1 horizon. This
stratum appears to define the Late Prehistoric cultural horizon, as artifacts recovered from
the A-horizon and the C2 and deeper strata consist mainly of small debitage such as
thinning and finishing flakes and other materials that appear to have been transported
vertically by bioturbation.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The excavation of four 1 meter by 1-meter test units resulted in the recovery of
170 artifacts from an area measuring 0.39 hectares (0.60 acres). These artifacts were
unevenly distributed with the highest concentrations observed within the site center.

Artifact frequency was highest within Stratum II, which accounted for 76% of the
total. Artifact types consisted of pottery (n=55), which was the most common artifact,
followed by flake shatter (n=47), biface thinning flakes (n=22), biface finishing flakes
(n=23), organic remains (n=12), initial reduction flakes (n=8), unspecified reduction
flakes (n=6), projectile point fragments (n=2), and biface initial reduction flakes (n=1).
One cultural feature was identified in Test Unit N0 E5 consisting of a small midden
deposit.
Artifact density was highest in Test Unit N0 E5, which was situated in the center
of the site. This test unit produced artifact densities over four times as high as the other
units located at this site. Trench excavation, which took place adjacent to Test Unit N0
E5, resulted in the recovery of 193 artifacts. Diagnostic artifacts included Goose Creek
ceramics and a single Alba point (Plates 9 and 10).

Temporal Affiliation and Site Function
The majority of temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from Stratum II.
These consisted of 55 prehistoric ceramic sherds that generally exhibited a Late
Prehistoric Goose Creek paste. However, several sherds with smoothed exterior and
interior were noted in the assemblage. Three exhibited a brushed surface treatment. The
presence of these non-typical treatments suggests at least some interaction with or
influence from LMV groups to the east. No temporally diagnostic stone implements

were recovered from the test units. The single diagnostic point, an Alba, was recovered
from between approximately 80 and 90 centimeters (31.5 and 35.43 inches) below datum
from the test trench (Plate 10).
The artifact patterning seems to indicate a non-random distribution of cultural
material. Test Unit N0 E5 contains a high diversity of artifact types within a relatively
small area. This artifact assemblage includes debitage produced as a result of stone tool
production, ceramics, and domestic refuse. This suggests that the site was the locus of
multiple activities associated with a seasonal campsite.

Integrity of Deposits
Artifact density suggests that most of the site is confined to a relatively small area
of the landform on which it is situated. Given the site’s close proximity to an intermittent
tributary channel of Cypress Creek (see Figures 1, 2, 5, and 14), it is likely that the site
may have once been much larger to the south but that growth in the intermittent drainage
as a function of changes in the morphology of Cypress Creek has subsequently resulted in
erosion and redeposition of much of the deposit elsewhere. Feature 1 contained a denser
accumulation of artifacts and included concentrations of organic material in the form of
mammal bone fragments. This feature was interpreted as small, remnant portion of a
possible midden. This feature may be a primary deposit most of which was truncated
possibly by fluvial processes associated with the tributary channel further south; or a
secondary deposit composed of midden materials once at a higher level than the feature
that dropped into a burrow or other natural void. No other features were encountered
during test unit or trench excavation and artifact density was generally lower away from
the tributary channel. This suggests that activities at Site 41HR1000 were largely
concentrated in and near the tributary channel.

SITE 41HR1001
Site 41HR1001 was originally identified during the intensive pedestrian survey of
Area B3. It encompasses an area of approximately 0.59 hectares (1.07 acres). The site
lies on a small rise near the confluence of Pillot Gully and Cypress Creek (Figure 2). The
site is heavily wooded and is bounded on the north by a wetland, to the south by Pillot
Gully, and to the east by a small ravine. A total of 8 test excavation units were placed
within the site boundary from which a total of 230 artifacts were recovered. The
placement of these units was based upon artifact density data as produced from the
intensive survey results (Figures 6 and 16). The results of these investigations will be
detailed below.

datum. Two strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer of
10YR 5/3 sandy clay loam that extended from the surface to a depth of 32 centimeters
below datum. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 6/4 fine sand. All artifacts were
recovered from Stratum II with the highest densities occurring between 80 and 100
centimeters (31.5 and 39.37 inches) below datum. Auger testing was performed at the
base of this unit to a depth of 200 centimeters (78.74 inches) below datum. No additional
artifacts were encountered in the auger test.

TEST UNIT N0 W5
This unit was situated in an area identified during intensive pedestrian shovel
testing having a moderate density of artifacts. A total of 27 prehistoric artifacts were
recovered from this unit. Of these 26 consisted of debitage from stone tool production
and 1 was a body fragment of a jasper biface (Table 24).

The test unit was excavated to a depth of 130 centimeters (51.18 inches) below
datum. Two strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer of
10YR 4/2 fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of approximately 30
centimeters (11.81 inches) below datum. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 6/3
fine sand. All artifacts were recovered from Stratum II with the highest densities
occurring within levels 3 and 8. No auger testing was performed in this unit.
The biface recovered from this unit resembles a stemmed point (see Turner and
Hester 199:274). The base is beveled as well and shows some likeness to the Early
Stemmed Lanceolate (Turner and Hester 1999:107), and finally the Angostura (Turner
and Hester 1999:73) types. Due to the numerous resharpening episodes along the lateral
margin of the blade it is impossible to tell definitively state exactly what the type is
although based on the grinding along the lateral margins, and overall shape of the base it
is suggested that it is an early type. The burin-like fracture along the tip is old.

TEST UNIT N10 E0
This unit was situated in an area identified during intensive pedestrian shovel
testing having a moderate density of artifacts. A total of 26 prehistoric artifacts were
recovered from this unit. Of these 25 consisted of debitage from stone tool production
and 1 was a jasper Yarbrough with beveled blade margins (Table 25; Plate 11).
The test unit was excavated to a depth of 110 centimeters below datum. Two
strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer of 10YR 5/2 sandy
clay loam that extended from the surface to a depth of 28 centimeters (11.02 inches)
below datum. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 6/3 fine sand. All artifacts were
recovered from Stratum II with the highest densities occurring within level 9. Auger
testing was performed at the base of this unit to a depth of 150 centimeters (59.06 inches)
below datum. No additional artifacts were encountered in the auger test.

TEST UNIT N25 E15
This unit was situated in an area identified during intensive pedestrian shovel
testing having a moderately high density of artifacts. Twenty prehistoric artifacts were
recovered from this unit. Of these 16 consisted of debitage from stone tool production
and 4 were prehistoric ceramic sherds (Table 27).
The test unit was excavated to a depth of 100 centimeters below datum. Two
strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer of 10YR 4/3 sandy
clay loam that extended from the surface to a depth of approximately 30 centimeters
(11.81 inches) below datum. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 6/3 fine sand.
Two artifacts were recovered from the base of Stratum I, while the remainder came from
Stratum II. Auger testing was performed at the base of this unit to a depth of 160
centimeters (62.99 inches) below datum. A third stratum was encountered in the auger
test. It was classified as a 10YR 6/3 sandy clay and no additional artifacts were
encountered.

The test unit was excavated to a depth of 100 centimeters (39.37 inches) below
datum. Two strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer of
10YR 4/2 fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of 26 centimeters (10.24
inches) below datum. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 6/3 fine sand which
graded to 10YR 5/6 as depth increased. Ironstone concretions became more abundant
with depth as well. All artifacts were recovered from Stratum II with the highest
densities occurring within level 7. Auger testing was performed at the base of this unit to
a depth of 160 centimeters (62.99 inches) below datum. A third stratum, which was
encountered at approximately 105 centimeters (41.34 inches), was encountered in the
auger test. It was classified as a 10YR 5/3 clayey sand with 7.5YR 4/6 mottles. No
additional artifacts were encountered in the auger test.

TEST UNIT S10 W5
This unit was situated in an area identified during intensive pedestrian shovel
testing having a low density of artifacts. A total of 53 prehistoric artifacts were recovered
from this unit. These consisted of debitage from stone tool (n=51) production, stone
implement (n=1), and prehistoric ceramics (n=1) (Table 29). The stone implement
consisted of a heavily reworked petrified wood Gary point (Plate 11).
The test unit was excavated to a depth of 100 centimeters (39.37 inches) below
datum. Two strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I consisted of a layer of
10YR 5/2 fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of 28 centimeters (11.02
inches) below datum. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 6/3 fine sand ironstone
concretions. All artifacts were recovered from Stratum II with the highest densities
occurring in level 4. No auger testing was performed in this unit.

TEST UNIT S20 W5
This unit was situated in an area identified during intensive pedestrian shovel
testing having a low density of artifacts. A total of 28 prehistoric artifacts were recovered
from this unit. Of these 18 consisted of debitage from stone tool production and 10 were
prehistoric ceramic sherds (Table 30). The test unit was excavated to a depth of 105
centimeters below datum. Four strata were observed in the unit profile. Stratum I
consisted of a layer of 10YR 4/2 fine sand that extended from the surface to a depth of 10
centimeters (3.937 inches) below datum. This was underlain by a stratum of 10YR 5/3
fine sand which extended to a depth of 19 centimeters (7.48 inches). This was followed
by a 17-centimeter thick layer of 10YR 5/2 fine sand. Underlying this was a stratum of
10YR 6/3 fine sand which extended to the base of the excavation unit. All artifacts were
recovered from Stratum IV with the highest densities occurring within level 7. Auger
testing was performed at the base of this unit to a depth of 160 centimeters (62.99 inches)
below datum.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The excavation of eight 1x1 meter2 test units resulted in the recovery of 230
artifacts from an area measuring 0.59 hectares (1.07 acres). These artifacts were
unevenly distributed with the highest concentrations observed in Test Unit S10 W5,
which was situated in the central portion of the site.
Artifact frequency was highest within Stratum II, which accounted for 82% of the
total. Artifact types consisted of biface thinning flakes (n=61), which along with flake
shatter (n=61), were the most common artifact type observed. These were followed in
frequency by initial reduction flakes (n=31), pottery (n=24), biface finishing flakes
(n=23), unspecified reduction flakes (n=22), organic remains (n=12), biface initial
reduction flakes (n=3), chip (n=2), projectile points (n=2), and biface tools (n=1). This
site contained a relatively low proportion of prehistoric ceramics (10 percent) versus
other artifacts.

Temporal Affiliation and Site Function
The majority of temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from Stratum II.
These consisted of only 24 prehistoric ceramic sherds. When typology was possible, the
ceramic type was identified as Goose Creek, which dates to the Late Prehistoric. Several
other sherds in the assemblage were too small to positively type, but exhibited a sandy
paste similar to that typical of Goose Creek ware. All stone implements were recovered
from deposits that lacked ceramics and were situated below the ceramic-bearing levels.
However, the Yarbrough point and the Gary point were the only stone implements
recovered from the site that are temporally diagnostic. While the assemblage almost
certainly represents different temporal deposits, the very small number of diagnostic
stone tools recovered does not provide clear evidence that distinct stratigraphic deposits
are represented.

93

Although the sample population is relatively small in number, the artifact
patterning seems to indicate a non-random distribution of artifacts. This may suggest that
multiple activities took place, could indicate changes in site function over time, or may be
indicative simply of repeated site usage and changes in technology over time. In several
units, artifact type diversity decreases with depth, as seen in Test Units S10 W5 and S20
W5. There also are indications that activities (or at least artifact distribution) were
specific to certain areas. Test Units N25 E10, N25 E15, S20 W5, and S10 W5 all
contained ceramics while N0 W30, N0 W5, N10 E0, and N14 W10 contained only
debitage and stone implements. In general, the presence of what primarily consists of
debitage from various stages of lithic reduction site seems to represent a series of tool
refurbishing episodes.

Integrity of Deposits
While the site is located in an area that has been subject to channel migration and
multiple erosion/redeposition events, it appears to possess a somewhat intact
archaeological context. It seems unlikely that the discreetly patterned archaeological
deposits observed at this site would be the result of natural redepositional processes.
However, given the nature of the archaeological assemblage, the overall
homogeneity of the material present, and the sparseness of temporally diagnostic
artifacts, it is impossible to conclusively determine the depositional integrity of the site.
Excavations in close proximity to the site hint at a depositional environment affected at
least to some degree by bioturbation from tree roots and burrowing animals, both of
which were observed during deep testing and pedestrian survey of the area. Shovel tests
excavated near the site boundaries contained modern, plastic food wrappers at a depth of
approximately 70 centimeters (27.56 inches) below the surface.
Even if the stratigraphic situation was less ambiguous, the artifact count per unit
is, on average, extremely low (less than 29 per 1 meter by 1 meter unit). The low density
of the site, coupled with the limited quantity of temporally diagnostic artifacts, suggests
that the potential to recover meaningful data from this site is limited.

CHAPTER VIII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A key factor in creating a strategy for sampling a project area is the development
of a predictive model whereby investigation can be concentrated most efficiently in areas
with the greatest potential for containing intact cultural resources. These models are
based on soil and topographic characteristics, including variations in elevation, distance
to existing or remnant water sources, and plant communities. Generally, these include
areas located near existing watercourses. These models serve as heuristic devices that
assists researchers in devising sampling strategies best suited for collecting data in given
environmental settings. The predictive model developed for this project area, as well as
the results of previous studies, indicated that the areas near Cypress Creek hold a high
potential for containing archaeological resources.
However, when attempting to identify intact deposits researchers working on
prehistoric sites in this region are faced with a difficult problem. Namely, cleanly
stratified archaeological deposits are seldom encountered in northern Harris County and
much of Montgomery County. The site formation processes that contribute to this
situation are worthy of independent study, but in general when environmental conditions
such as the slow development of sandy soils interspersed with episodes of severe
flooding and lateral stream movement are combined with human activities such as
historic land modification and modern urbanization, it is no wonder that relatively few
well defined cultural deposits have been identified and studied in this area. These factors
have complicated the already difficult task of reconstructing cultural traditions and
developing chronologies associated with the highly mobile lifeways of the prehistoric
hunter-gatherer populations.
Cultural resources survey efforts within the Vintage Development project area
resulted in the identification of 8 cultural resource loci (41HR997, Isolate 1, 41HR998,
41HR999, Isolate 2, 41HR1000, 41HR1001, and Isolate 3). Two previously recorded
archaeological sites (41HR344 and 41HR354) were identified as being within the project
APE during the literature and background review. In general, the location of these
resources fit the model. Exceptions to this were noted when prehistoric isolate finds were
encountered in upland areas, indicative perhaps of expedient tool refurbishing or loss, and
a single historic homestead site.
Data from deep tests and shovel testing collected throughout the project area
confirmed that Pre-Holocene soils were encountered at increasingly shallower depths as
distance from Cypress Creek increased. However, even within the meander belt of
Cypress Creek, where the Pre-Holocene contact can lie at a depth of several meters, the
occurrence of deeply buried cultural materials having integrity was limited to within
approximately 2 meters (6 feet) of the surface. This is illustrated in the test unit and
trench profiles from Site 41HR1000 (see Figures 10 and 12) which was excavated in
close proximity to the channel of Cypress Creek. The maximum depth of cultural
95

materials was underlain by sands typical of fluviatile facies such as those observed at
similar depths in the modern channel wall (see Figure 7).
Below these depths there was strong evidence, in the form of Holocene fluvial
facies, that older Holocene alluvium had been reworked by fluvial processes. In addition,
there was strong evidence of modern disturbances to many near channel areas by lake and
road construction. Even when deeply buried cultural material was located, such as at Site
41HR1000, the base of the cultural deposits was formed by Holocene alluvium that
showed evidence of disturbance by fluvial processes. In addition, the depth to the Lissie
formation was shallow (less than 3-meters [9 feet]) in the topographically high areas
within the meander belt where Sites 41HR1000 and 41HR1001 were discovered.
By comparing soils data with artifact distribution in the sites, this study also
suggests that while soil changes indicative of cultural features may be preserved in
certain situations, researchers should not rely on visual and textural variation in soils in
these sandy alluvial settings. The identification of artifact concentrations and a finer
analysis of artifact distribution resulting from hand excavated units is required when
attempting to locate occupation levels and, potentially, more ephemeral cultural features.

ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS
Following Section 106 of the NHPA, any federal undertaking must take into
account its effect on historic resources, i.e., architectural or archaeological properties on
or eligible for the NRHP. Once resources are identified within the project’s APE, they
must be evaluated for their National Register eligibility (Advisory Council for Historic
Preservation 1999).
When an archaeological site has been discovered, a major goal associated with
any archaeological evaluation is to make recommendations concerning the eligibility of
the resource for the NRHP. Archaeological resources are most frequently evaluated for
eligibility in regard to Criterion D: information potential.
For a site to be considered eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D, it must
possess information bearing on an important scientific research question. Important
research questions commonly involve testing new or former hypotheses regarding topics
in the natural sciences and/or addressing aspects of the cultural chronology of a region.
This information must be evaluated within the framework of an historic context,
meaning, the researcher must be able to address how the information contained within the
resource is likely to effect current understanding of a particular time period (USDI
1983:II-26, 1991:21). In order for an archaeological resource to be considered
significant, it generally must retain integrity. While sites that have been disturbed
through natural or cultural processes can still be eligible if their undisturbed portions
contain significant information potential, sites that have lost their stratigraphic context are
commonly considered to have lost integrity of location (USDI 1983:II-26, 1991:23, 49).
The eligibility recommendations for all newly identified cultural resources are listed in
Table 31.

Site 41HR997 was identified as a prehistoric campsite. This site covers an area
approximately 100 meters long by 75 meters (328 by 246 feet) wide, on property that is
currently under private ownership. The artifact patterning seems to indicate a nonrandom distribution of cultural material that includes debitage produced as a result of
stone tool manufacture and a high proportion of ceramics. This suggests that the site was
the locus of multiple activities most likely associated with a seasonal campsite. Site
41HR997 has the potential to contribute to the understanding of prehistory in the area,
and is recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Current development plans
include avoidance of this site and dedication of the property to Harris County as public
parkland. Artifacts will be returned to the landowner at the conclusion of this project.
However, if the site is dedicated to the county and determined eligible to the National
Register, the site’s potential as a candidate for Texas State Archeological Landmark
status should be considered. Additional information regarding preservation plans for this
site is presented in Appendix C.
Isolate 1, identified as a prehistoric isolate, was initially identified through a
single positive shovel test containing lithic flakes. This resource is located on privately
owned property. State designated trinomials were not sought for this site. The site does
not appear to have the potential to yield information important to the understanding of
prehistory in the area, and no further work is recommended in association with this
resource.
Site 41HR998 is identified as a historic homestead. Based on conversations with
a local informant, this site is the former location of the Rafe homestead and Model T
sawmill site, circa 1916 (John Breithaupt, personal communication 2005). The remains
of this sawmill were present on the property prior to its sale to Compaq Computers in the
late 1980’s, but have since been removed by relic collectors. The fate of Mr. Rafe’s
homestead is unknown, and may have been removed at some time in the past. A single
standing structure was identified during survey, and is thought to be associated with the
occupation of Site 41HR998. This structure, which was converted for use as a pump
house, appears to be a cupola from the roof of a larger structure that had been removed
and placed on the ground. This resource is located on private property. The site does not

97

appear to have the potential to yield information important to the understanding of history
in the area. No further work is recommended in association with this resource.
Site 41HR999, identified as a prehistoric isolate, was initially identified through
one positive shovel test containing a single Early Triangular projectile point. No
additional cultural material was noted during site delineation efforts. The site is located
on private property, and does not appear to have the potential to yield information
important to the understanding of prehistory in the area. No further work is
recommended in association with this resource.
Isolate 2, identified as a prehistoric isolate, was initially identified through a
single positive shovel test containing 2 lithic flakes. State designated trinomials were not
sought for this site. The site is located on private property, and does not appear to have
the potential to yield information important to the understanding of prehistory in the area.
No further work is recommended in association with this resource.
Site 41HR1000 is identified as a prehistoric campsite situated on a terrace located
along the north bank of Cypress Creek. Although this site covers an area approximately
120 meters (393.7 feet) long by 60 meters (196.9 feet) wide, artifact density plots and
soils data indicates that much of the site has been either scoured by stream migration or
flooding, or has been otherwise redeposited. Remnant Feature 1, which is interpreted as
the remains of a midden deposit, supports this conclusion. Only a small portion in the
central and southernmost section of the site maintains integrity. However, within this
portion a relatively high concentration of artifacts were recovered from good
archaeological context. Although the integrity of portions of Site 41HR1000 has been
compromised, the central and southern portion has the potential to yield information
important to the understanding of prehistory in the area. Therefore Site 41HR1000 is
recommended by HRA Gray & Pape as eligible for inclusion in the National Register.
This resource is located on private property, however a detention basin is planned for
construction adjacent to this site. In order to protect the site from damage, HRA Gray &
Pape recommends that a 30-meter (100-foot) wide buffer be established around the
eligible portion of the site prior to construction. Additional information regarding
preservation plans for this site is presented in Appendix C.
Site 41HR1001 is identified as a very light density prehistoric campsite. The site
is situated on a terrace located near what appears to be an abandoned creek channel
approximately 30 meters (98.43 feet) north of the confluence of Pillot Gully and Cypress
Creek. This site covers an area approximately 105 meters (344.5 feet) long by 90 meters
(295.3 feet) wide, and is located on private property. Although some integrity to the
archaeological deposits is apparent at this site, the low overall artifact density, lack of
features, and small number of diagnostic artifacts indicates that the potential to recover
meaningful data from this site is limited. Although additional testing or trench
excavation would doubtless result in additional artifacts being collected, there is no
indication that the average count of less than 30 artifacts per 1x1 meter unit would
increase, or that additional work would result in the discovery of subsurface features;
debitage from various stages of the lithic reduction sequence was the most prominent
class of artifact recovered, which suggests that the location was used primarily for tool
98

refurbishing. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that Site 41HR1001 is not eligible for
inclusion in the National Register, and no further work is recommended at this site.
Isolate 3, a prehistoric lithic scatter, is located on a small artificial island
approximately 100 meters (328.1 feet) north of Cypress Creek. The site was identified in
2 shovel tests by the presence of 1 quartzite flake and 1 chert flake. State designated
trinomials were not sought for this site. The site is located on private property. The site
does not appear to have the potential to yield information important to the understanding
of prehistory in the area, and no further work is recommended in association with this
resource.
Previously identified Site 41HR344 was originally described as a prehistoric lithic
scatter along the north bank of Cypress Creek, within an easement controlled by Harris
County Flood Control. When first identified the site consisted of 2 petrified wood
bifaces and 1 worked chert fragment. The original context of this material is unknown,
as the area had been heavily disturbed by dredging and creek bank channelization prior to
the discovery of the artifacts. Shovel testing to 1 meter (3.281 feet) and surface/cutbank
inspection along Cypress Creek were conducted in an attempt to relocate this site. These
efforts failed to yield any additional artifacts. It is likely that erosion along Cypress
Creek has destroyed this light density site. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no
further archaeological investigation be required in this area.
Previously identified Site 41HR354, a prehistoric isolate, was originally recorded
at the surface near an animal burrow. An attempt was made to relocate this site through
both surface/cutbank inspection and subsurface testing. No cultural materials were
observed. The recorded location of this site may be in error, however, it should either be
associated with Site 41HR1001, which was identified near the area during survey, or it
has been destroyed by erosion or channalization.

INTRODUCTION

This document outlines a plan that has been developed to protect and preserve
archaeological Sites 41HR997 and 41HR1000, both of which are located adjacent to
Cypress Creek in Harris County, Texas. Investigation and eligibility testing at these sites
was initiated in accordance with United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
Permit Application Number 23895 in April and May 2005 and in July and August 2005
(Pickering et al 2005). Testing at these sites resulted in a recommendation that both were
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D
(United States Department of the Interior 1982). Following the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) concurrence with this recommendation in December of 2005, V&W
Partners began to finalize modifications to their land plan for the proposed Vintage
residential development to ensure avoidance and protection of these important cultural
resources. This avoidance plan has been developed in order to comply with USACE
permitting requirements and at the request of the THC. The plan will be appended to the
final report documenting survey and evaluation efforts within the Vintage project area.

PREVIOUS WORK AT SITES 41HR997 AND 41HR1000
The Vintage development project will include construction of residential homes,
commercial centers, residential streets, utilities, and detention ponds. The Area of
Potential Effect (APE) for this project was defined as all property within the
approximately 154.6-hectares (382-acre) tract proposed for development. Several buried
cultural resources were recorded during the initial investigation, and two of these, Sites
41HR997 and 41HR1000, were recommended for inclusion in the National Register and
avoidance (Figure 1). Revisions to the V&W Partners land plan included avoidance of
these locations, and establishment of protective buffer zones extending to between 23 and
30 meters (75 and 100 feet) beyond the boundaries of both sites (Figure 2).

SITE 41HR997
Site 41HR997, identified as a prehistoric campsite, was initially located by a
single positive shovel test containing prehistoric ceramic fragments and lithic material.
The site lies within a wooded upland area approximately 100 meters (328.1 feet) south of
Pillot Gully (Figure 3). This site was delineated by the placement of shovel tests spaced
at 10 to 15-meter (32.81 to 49.21–foot) intervals radiating in cardinal directions from
positive shovel tests (Figure 3). A total of 50 additional shovel tests were needed for the
delineation of this site, 15 of which were positive for cultural material. Prehistoric
artifacts consisted primarily of ceramic sherds and lithic fragments. This site covers an

Evaluation testing at Site 41HR997 indicated a non-random artifact distribution
that included debitage produced as a result of stone tool manufacture, and a high
proportion of ceramics. This suggests that the site was the locus of multiple activities
most likely associated with a seasonal campsite and retained good archaeological context.
In addition, diagnostic stone implements consisted of a small, contracting stem, Gary
point and a fluted San Patrice point, both recovered from the same excavation unit. The
Gary point, found in level 6, dates from the Middle to Transitional Archaic. It has been
indicated that this type decreases in size over time (Ford and Webb 1956: 52-54).
Ceramics were encountered within deposits containing the Gary point. The San Patrice
point, which dates to the Paleoindian period, was found in level 13. Ceramics were not
recovered in association with this dartpoint in the lower levels.
The prehistoric ceramics consisted mainly of Goose Creek pottery, which date to
the Late Prehistoric, or sandy paste pottery that was too small to accurately classify.
Several sherds were made of a Goose Creek paste but exhibited smoothed interiors and
exteriors. A single decorated rim sherd was recovered, which exhibited a combination of
punctuations and curvilinear incising reminiscent of Caddo or Lower Mississippi Valley
(LMV) treatments. This sherd was too small to classify, but seemed to follow
Schambach’s observations regarding rim versus body decorative treatments in the
Felsenthal Region of southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana (Rolingson and
Schambach 1981: 107).

SITE 41HR1000
Site 41HR1000, identified as a prehistoric campsite, was initially identified
through 5 positive shovel tests containing prehistoric ceramic fragments, lithic material,
and a projectile point. The site is situated on a terrace located along the north bank of
Cypress Creek (Figure 4). This site was delineated by the placement of shovel tests
spaced at 10 to 15-meter (32.81 to 49.21-foot) intervals radiating in cardinal directions

from positive shovel tests. A total of 20 additional shovel tests were needed for the
delineation of this site, 1 of which was positive for cultural material consisting of nondiagnostic lithic debitage. Deep test trenching with in the southern portion of the site
suggested that the artifact density increased until approximately 1 meter (3 feet) below
the surface. Cultural material consisted mainly of prehistoric ceramics and lithic
debitage. This site covers an area approximately 120 meters long by 60 meters (393.7 by
196.9 feet) wide. Table 2 provides a series of coordinate points that define the site
boundary and location.

Evaluation testing at the site indicated that a small portion in the central and
southernmost section of the site had the most integrity, and within this portion a relatively
high concentration of artifacts were recovered from good archaeological context. These
consisted of prehistoric ceramic sherds that generally exhibited a Late Prehistoric Goose
Creek paste. However, several sherds with smoothed exterior and interior were noted in
the assemblage. Three exhibited a brushed surface treatment. The presence of these nontypical treatments suggests the possibility of at least some interaction with or influence
from LMV groups to the east. A single diagnostic point, an Alba, was recovered from
between approximately 80 and 90 centimeters (31.5 and 35.43 inches) below datum from
the test trench.

SITE AVOIDANCE AND PROTECTION
V&W Partners is committed to the protection of Sites 41HR997 and 41HR1000,
both during development of the Vintage community and in perpetuity. Protection of
these sites during the construction of the residential community will be accomplished by
the installation of temporary fencing around each site’s established buffer, and
monitoring of all excavation and earth-moving activities that take place in the vicinity of
these buffers by a professional archaeologist. Long-term protection will be accomplished
by designating Sites 41HR997 and 41HR1000 as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
Fencing and monitoring will prevent disturbances to the sites during development, while
SAL designation will provide for the long-term preservation of the sites in accordance
with the Antiquities Code of Texas. An outline of the steps that will be taken during
construction and for SAL designation is provided below.

SITE AVOIDANCE DURING CONSTRUCTION
Survey and evaluation efforts at Sites 41HR997 and 41HR1000 have resulted in
well-established site boundaries at both locations. During the survey phase, the location
of each shovel test that contained cultural material was recorded with sub-meter accurate
Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment, and the location of each site and site buffer
zone was incorporated into land planning documents (see Figure 2). HRA Gray & Pape
archaeologists will use this information to establish the boundaries of each site and the
limits of the protective buffers, and to stake these boundaries in the field. Fieldwork will
consist of mapping the established site location and boundaries, establishment and
mapping of the buffer zones, and site and buffer zone staking. Site and buffer zone
staking will be accomplished by use of a total station. HRA Gray & Pape will also
provide assistance during the installation of temporary fencing around the buffer zone, in
order to ensure that the protected area for each site is clearly established and marked for
avoidance during construction.
Once construction begins, archaeological monitors will be present during all
excavation or other land modification activities that are proposed to take place
immediately adjacent to the established buffers. In order to protect the archaeological
integrity of the sites, information regarding the purpose of and need for the buffers and
the monitors will be treated as privileged information.
Archaeological monitors will be present, and monitoring will take place during
excavation or land modification activities. Monitors will not be present during
subsequent phases of construction; however, the construction crew will be provided with
an inadvertent discovery plan and contact information if unexpected finds are
encountered after the monitoring phase is completed.

LONG TERM SITE PRESERVATION
SAL designations are provided for archaeological sites in Texas that can add to an
understanding of prehistory or history in a particular region of the state. This designation
enables present and future owners of the property on which significant archaeological
sites are located to participate in the long-term preservation and protection of the cultural
resources in the state. SAL designations stipulate that the property or artifacts within a
property cannot be excavated, removed, or otherwise altered without a permit from the
THC. Doing so ensures that the cultural resources are properly documented if they
cannot be preserved at some time in the future. SAL designations on private land are
recorded in the county deed records, and conveyed if the property is sold.
V&W Partners has modified their original land plan and have established buffer
zones around the boundaries of each site to ensure that 41HR997 and 41HR1000 are not
affected by construction activities. In addition, as the current legal owners of the

8

property on which the sites are located, V&W Partners have completed an application for
SAL nomination for each site. Copies of these forms are provided in Appendix A.
The SAL application forms were completed and submitted for review in May
2006. These are expected to be before the review committee in October 2006, and formal
designation is expected soon after.
