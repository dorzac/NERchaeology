ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a 100% pedestrian survey with
shovel testing along the proposed expansion route of FM 1044 in Comal and
Guadalupe Counties, Texas, on tracts where right-of-entry was available. Work
was conducted under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and
the Antiquities Code of Texas, in accordance with 36 CFR 800 and 13 TAC 26,
which outline the rules and regulations for compliance. Investigators excavated
64 shovel tests in support of the survey and documented two new archeological
sites—Sites 41CM301 and 41CM302 and one prehistoric isolated find. Site
41CM301 is a small and shallow prehistoric lithic scatter. This site is not
recommended as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Site
41CM302, which consists of an 1845 standing farmhouse and associated
yardscape, is eligible for listing on the NRHP under Criterion A. It was not
shovel tested as part of the survey, since it lies outside the APE for archeological
resources. However, this report recommends that if the site is impacted by
future projects, then thorough survey that includes shovel testing should be
conducted to determine eligibility under Criterion D as well. A single tested
cobble was observed on the surface between Weil Road and Green Valley Road.
This area was thoroughly inspected, but no additional artifacts were
encountered. It was therefore recorded as an isolated find. A previously
recorded prehistoric and historic site, 41GU38, is situated within the APE,
however, surveyors did not have right-of-entry to the property on which the
historic component is located, and were not able to fully assess it as part of this
survey. Investigators recorded a sparse lithic scatter on the portion of Site
41GU38 for which access was permitted. The portion of the site investigated
contains no elements that would qualify the site as eligible for the NRHP. Based
on the results of the survey, it is recommended that no further investigations are
required for any of the properties surveyed. However, further assessment is
recommended for properties for which right-of-entry was unavailable. No
artifacts were collected during the survey; all project related documents and
records will be permanently curated at TARL.

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
In September 2006, Hicks & Company archeologist surveyed portions of the
proposed expanded FM 1044 roadway located outside of New Braunfels, Texas
(Figure 1). The roadway expansion project is located in Comal and Guadalupe
Counties, and is sponsored by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
and the Federal Highways Administration (FHWA). The proposed project area
encompasses expanded and new location roadway extending from Rueckle Road
at the IH 35 frontage to Weil Road at the existing FM 1044, for a total distance of
4.5 miles and covers a total area of approximately 56 acres of additional right-of­
way. Surveyors had permission to enter approximately half of the total project
area, all of which is currently privately owned. The proposed FM 1044 project
will involve improvements within existing right-of-way (along Rueckle Road, and
FM 1044) as well as approximately 56.11 acres of additional new right-of-way
(ROW). A substantial portion of the acquired ROW will be along a new location
realignment of the FM 1044 roadway. The proposed new ROW for the expanded
FM 1044 facility will have an average width of 150 feet. Work was conducted
under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities
Code of Texas (TAC Permit #4246); in accordance with 36 CFR 800 and 13 TAC
26, which outlines the rules and regulations for compliance.
The FM 1044 investigation included an initial archival search to identify all
previously recorded surveys, archeological sites, and historic structures.
Background research for this project was conducted at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
According to records at TARL, there is one previously recorded site within 1,000
feet the project area. Site 41GU38 lies directly within the proposed ROW
approximately 1,000 feet north of Green Valley Road. It was recorded as a
historic and prehistoric debris scatter during a 1995 transmission line survey.
A standing windmill was the only historic feature recorded. The site was
recommended as ineligible for the National Register of Historic Places. In
addition, a recent historic structures survey conducted by Hicks & Company
architectural historians identified one NRHP-eligible historic structure located
close to the project area. This property consists of a brick house built in the
1840s and associated yard, located on Rueckle Road. The currently proposed
alignment will have no direct affect on either the house or the yard, as it will
take additional ROW from the opposite side of the Rueckle Road. It was not
shovel tested as part of the survey, since it lies outside the APE for archeological
resources.
However, it was recorded as Site 41CM302, because visual
inspection from the current Rueckle Road right-of-way indicated potential for
associated historic archeological deposits.

Right-of-entry was available for approximately two miles of the proposed new
ROW. The survey involved intensive pedestrian inspection of these areas. In
accordance with the THC’s minimum standards for linear archeological survey,
shovel tests were excavated at 100-meter intervals along transects no greater
than 30 meters apart. Additional shovel tests were placed in areas where
cultural materials were encountered. Archeological sites were defined by a
minimum of six shovel tests at each site, except Site 41CM302 where right-of­
entry was not available. Shovel tests were excavated in ten centimeter levels to
a depth of one meter below the surface, ancient or disturbed soils, or until
otherwise obstructed, and all sediment was screened through ¼” wire mesh.
Investigators recorded their observations and the results of shovel tests through
notes, standardized shovel test forms, and photographs.
A total of 64 shovel tests were excavated in support of the project (Figures 2 and
3). Four of these were positive for cultural material at sites 41CM301, and
41GU38, along with the identification of one isolated artifact (IF1). Artifacts on
Site 41CM301 consisted of one flake and one crude unifacial tool. No further
testing is recommended for this site. Artifacts including lithic debitage and one
unifacial tool were observed on the surface at Site 41GU38, at an approximate
density of one artifact per fifty square meters. The site extends onto an adjacent
property to the southwest that investigators did not have permission to enter.
The adjacent property largely contained the historic component of the site,
which consists of a windmill, debris, and possibly additional features. No
further testing is recommended for the surveyed portion of 41GU38; however, it
is recommended that intensive survey, including shovel testing, be performed in
the historic component of the site once right-of-entry is obtained.
The survey was conducted between September 12 and September 14, 2006.
Rachel Feit functioned as the principal investigator. Matt Stotts and Suzanne
Smith, Hicks & Company Staff Archeologists performed the survey. Artifacts
were analyzed in the field and report writing and took place in September of
2006, immediately following the conclusion of fieldwork. Succeeding sections of
the report include sections on Environmental Setting, Cultural Background and
Previous Investigations, Results of Field Investigations, and Conclusions and
Recommendations.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area crosses through a developing landscape at the western edge of
the Blackland Prairie. Until recently the area was still largely rural. However,
new development spreading from San Antonio and New Braunfels has spurred
suburban growth, with dispersed commercial and residential development
fanning out from the major roadways. Large lot residential development,
businesses in the IH 35 vicinity, rangeland/pastureland, and, in Guadalupe
County, cultivated cropland dominates land use within. Within the limits of the
proposed project, FM 1044 is considered a minor arterial urban street. Two
major communities exist in the project vicinity. New Braunfels is located at the
northern end of FM 1044 and Seguin is located approximately four miles
southeast of the project.
The agricultural lands adjacent to FM 1044 in the proposed project limits are
utilized primarily for grazing. There are no publicly owned lands of national,
state, or local significance within the proposed project limits. The potential
prime farmland soils cover a surface area of approximately 21.03 acres within
the proposed project limits.
The geologic structures underlying the project area are primarily upper
Cretaceous-age rock. Most of the project area is underlain by Pecan Gap Chalk,
although a small area in the northeastern portion of the project area is
underlain by Fluviatile terrace deposits (UT Bureau of Economic Geology 1983).
Pecan Gap Chalk is composed of chalk and chalky marl. It weathers to form
moderately deep soil, is seldom exposed, and ranges in thickness from 100 to
400 feet. Fluviatile terrace deposits are composed of gravel, sand, silt, and clay.
These deposits are mainly found above flood level along entrenched streams.
Soils in the project area primarily consist of Altoga silty clay, Austin silty clay,
Heiden clay and Houston Black clay. These soils form on ancient stable uplands
through a very slow process of deposition. They therefore have very little
potential to contain deeply buried archeological materials. Prehistoric sites in
this type of environment would most likely be on the surface or only shallowly
buried.
The FM 1044 project area is located on the border of the Edwards Plateau and
Blackland Prairie regions of Texas. According to "The Vegetation Types of Texas"
(McMahan et. al 1984), vegetation in this region is described as cultivated crops
or row crops providing food and fiber for humans or domestic animals.
Grasslands associated with crop rotations are also present in this region. Areas
not utilized as crops are mapped as Live Oak-Ashe Juniper Woods, Live OakAshe Juniper Parks, and Live Oak-Mesquite-Ashe Juniper Parks.

CSJ# 2021-01-009

Trees that are commonly found in the region include plateau live oak (Quercus
fusiformis), ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), Texas oak (Quercus texana), shin oak
(Quercus sinuata var. breviloba), and cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia).
Other woody vegetation includes sumac (Rhus spp.), greenbrier (Smilax bonanox), poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), twisted leaf yucca (Yucca rupicola),
Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens), Texas
mountain laurel (Sophora secundiflora), prickly-pear cactus (Opuntia spp.), and
pencil cactus (O. leptocaulis) (Hatch et al. 1990).
Grasses that are typical of the area include switchgrass (Panicum virgatum),
Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), beardgrass (Bothriochloa spp.), little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), Canada
wildrye (Elymus canadensis), curly mesquite (Hilaria belangeri) and buffalograss
(Buchloe dactyloides).
Vegetation found within the project area is generally consistent with the mapped
types as found in “The Vegetation Types of Texas”, as the main vegetation type
in the project area consists of improved pasture for livestock grazing.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The FM 1044 improvements project area is situated along the transitional zone
of the Blackland Prairie of Central Texas and the South Texas regions. The two
zones bear distinct variations in prehistoric trends and information available.
Whereas, central Texas has more recorded archeological sites than any other
part of the state the South Texas region has fewer recorded sites, reflecting a
paucity of systematic excavations as well as the geomorphic characteristics of
the landscape as they pertain to site formation processes (Black 1989). The
south Texas Plains archeological region is a distinct entity but much of what is
known of the area is in part derived from comparisons made to the central Texas
region.
Central Texas Prehistoric Archeological Background
Most of the chronologies for central Texas are based on four distinct time
periods, representing a 12,000-year sequence of occupation.
This sequence
from Collins (2004) is as follows: Paleoindian (11,500-8,800 B.P.), Archaic
(8,800-1,300 or 1,200 B.P.), Late Prehistoric (1,200-300 B.P.), and Historic (300
B.P-present).
Although these divisions represent convenient temporal
categories, they are also based in large part on perceived adaptations in
subsistence, and are reflected in changes in lithic and other technologies.
The central Texas archeological area is one of the better-known regions of the
state. More sites have been recorded, tested, and excavated in central Texas
than in any other part of the state (Black 1989). Most of the prehistoric sites in
central Texas are open, unprotected sites sitting or situated on alluvial terraces
adjacent to streams or rivers (Black 1989). A typical open site in central Texas
contains refuse such as chert flaking debris, broken chert tools, fragmented
burned rock, land snails, fragmented animal bone (uncommon), and charred
plant remains (rare) (Black 1989). An additional characteristic of open sites is
the presence of diagnostic stone tools often representing occupations from
different periods or phases and ultimately suggesting repeated use over
hundreds or perhaps thousands of years. Black (1989) describes a range of
open site types expected to be encountered throughout central Texas, the most
pertinent of which will be discussed below.
Open occupation sites are occasionally found in upland areas such as hilltops,
hill slopes, or bluff tops that lack alluvial sediments. The characteristic lack of

Archeological Survey – FM 1044 – August 2007

9

CSJ# 2021-01-009

stratification at open sites in upland settings leads to interpretational problems,
as repeated occupations from many periods cannot be clearly separated.
Although stratified, preserved, open sites, occasionally found in active flood
plain environments, and single component open sites have been recorded, they
are somewhat rare. Buried sites in alluvial settings with intact, separated
prehistoric components or occupations have the potential to reveal meaningful
insights into prehistoric behavior through the distributional patterning of the
artifacts and are much sought after studies of central Texas prehistory (Black
1989).
Lithic open occupation sites, containing only debris from chert-working
activities, are most frequently found in upland areas and are often referred to as
lithic procurement, quarry, or workshop sites. Numerous surveys conducted in
the central Texas area suggest that these lithic sites are the most common site
type in many areas. The residues from such sites are believed to be the result of
specialized,
short-term
activities
whether
identified
as
tool
maintenance/manufacture locales or intensive chert resource procurement
locales.
South Texas Prehistoric Archeological Background
Although the south Texas Plains archeological region is a distinct entity, much
of what is known of the area is in part derived from comparisons and
extrapolation with adjacent areas that have been the subject of more intensive
investigation, particularly the central Texas archeological region. Syntheses of
the prehistory of south Texas Plains archeological region have been formulated
by Hester (1980), Hall et al. (1986), and Black (1989). More recently, Hester
(1995) has refined these syntheses in a general overview of the cultural history
of the region. These syntheses provide an outline of the basic chronological
divisions. This sequence, adapted from Black (1989) and Hester (1995), is based
on four time periods roughly parallel to those found in central Texas. These
time periods include: Paleoindian (11,200-8,000 B.P.), Archaic (8,000-1,200
B.P.), Late Prehistoric (1,200-400 B.P.), and Protohistoric (A.D. 400-300 B.P.).
Similar to the cultural chronology provided for the central Texas archeological
region, these divisions represent contrived temporal categories, but they are also
based in large part on perceived adaptations in subsistence, and are reflected in
changes in lithic and other technologies. These technological changes further
reflect changes in broader patterns of the environment and culture.
The south Texas Plains archeological region is poorly understood, reflecting
primarily a lack of systematic excavations as well as the geomorphic
characteristics of the landscape as they pertain to site formation processes. The
most commonly recorded sites in south Texas are open occupation sites. In
some cases, meaningful excavation of these sites has proven to be a challenge to

Archeological Survey – FM 1044 – August 2007

10

CSJ# 2021-01-009

archeologists (Hester 1995). This vexing situation stems from the exclusively
horizontal patterning of many open occupation sites in the region. These sites
tend to exist as laterally extensive occupation areas with temporally separated
components within a single surface, and that rarely overlap (Hester 1995:430).
Other open occupation sites, especially in upland settings, occur on stable
ancient surfaces with very shallow or deflated cultural deposits that are
sometimes impossible to conclusively attribute to a particular time period.
Comparatively few deeply stratified occupation sites have been excavated in
south Texas. Black posits that this is a result of both settlement patterning and
depositional context (Black 1989). Other site types present in south Texas
include lithic procurement and reduction sites, rockshelters, artifact caches,
and burials. Lithic procurement and reduction sites are somewhat common and
are typically found in upland areas where chert resources in the form of Uvalde
gravels occur.
Much of the prehistoric data on south Texas derives from Choke Canyon. There,
archeologists found sites spanning the entire spectrum of south Texas
prehistory. Only a handful of Paleoindian sites have been recorded at Choke
Canyon and these were found as shallow surface manifestations (Hall et al.
1986), suggesting that indigenous groups inhabited this region only briefly on
their way to someplace else.
Hester (1987) has suggested that another
explanation for the paucity of Paleoindian sites is that erosion and shifting river
channels have caused massive destruction of these already ephemeral remains.
The Early Archaic is likewise poorly represented at Choke Canyon, though data
collected from two carefully built stone hearths indicate that native peoples may
have relied heavily on aquatic resources. This idea is further supported by a
noticeable dearth of projectile points, which would otherwise indicate a strong
reliance on hunting (Hall et al. 1986). The archeology of Choke Canyon suggests
that during the Middle Archaic to Late Archaic periods, the population began to
steadily increase. Sites types and artifacts increasingly demonstrate a reliance
on plant foods and small mammal consumption. The incidences of burned rock
middens increase (though these occur more rarely in east or south Texas), as
well as ground stone, flake tools, and distally beveled gouges (Hall et al. 1986).
As in other parts of Texas, sites of the late and Protohistoric periods in south
Texas demonstrate a radical shift in technology with the abandonment of the
typical dart point and gouge tool kit and adoption of arrow points and ceramic
technology. Sites tend to be more closely clustered around creeks, rather than
dispersed along other landforms.
Historic Period
During the historic period Indian tribes lived in the area, including the
Karankawas, Tonkawas, Comanches, and Lipan Apaches, and witnessed the
first Europeans in the form of Spanish explorers. The Guadalupe River was

Archeological Survey – FM 1044 – August 2007

11

CSJ# 2021-01-009

named in 1689 by Spanish explorer Alonso de Leon. During the Spanish
Colonial period, Guadalupe and Comal Counties were sporadically settled; first
by the temporary San Xavier missions then, in 1807, the Spanish made their
last attempt to settle the region in San Marcos de Neve. The colony was
abandoned in 1812 after Comanche and Tonkawa raids. Early Anglo settlement
began in the 1820’s when families from the southern United States began to
move into what was called DeWitt’s colony. Like the Spanish, Anglo settlement,
however, was also plagued by Indian raids. One well-known raid began in the
summer of 1840, culminating in the Battle of Plum Creek, which stretched from
Lockhart all the way to San Marcos.
After the Revolution, the Republic of Texas rewarded those who had served with
land across the state, including part of what is now Guadalupe County. The
presence of soldiers encouraged many displaced families to return to the area,
fostering the development of new communities. The Republic of Texas formally
organized Guadalupe County in 1842, and the State of Texas reorganized it and
Comal County in 1846. As the state grew, counties were re-shuffled and in
1858 and 1874, Comal and Guadalupe counties were finally settled in their
respective current boundaries.
In 1845, a German immigrant group under the auspices of the colonial effort
known as the Adelsverein settled near Comal Springs. Initially known as “Prince
Solm’s estate on the Lahn River in western Germany, Braunfels,” it was
renamed to simply New Braunfels shortly after the Adelsverein collapsed. The
settlers wasted no time setting up their community, and within a decade
emerged as a premier manufacturing and crafts center, as well as the
commercial center for area agricultural pursuits. By 1850, it was reportedly the
fourth largest city in the state.
The population of the area grew rapidly. The town of Seguin became the county
seat of Guadalupe County and a popular stop on the stage line between Comal
County seat New Braunfels and nearby Gonzales after 1847. Seguin was also a
major market place for the region with many roads passing through. The
residents of Guadalupe County placed high value on education and set about
establishing schools including Guadalupe College in 1848 and the Guadalupe
High School Association in 1849. The area also saw several churches take root,
many of them also involved in education. As the population grew, so did the
farming community. Between 1850 and 1860, the amount of improved acreage
jumped almost ten times, from 4,433 acres to 42,115. During this boom
decade, stock raisers in the area started organizing cattle drives to California
and New Orleans.
Comal County always had diversified crops due largely in part to the agricultural
habits and practices of the German immigrants. Corn and livestock were

Archeological Survey – FM 1044 – August 2007

12

CSJ# 2021-01-009

particularly important, and were quickly augmented with cotton, wheat, oats,
wool, dairy products, and beef. As agriculture expanded west of New Braunfels
into the Hill Country, the town became an important agricultural processing and
distribution center. Cotton mills and wool manufacturing played a large part in
the area economy prior to and immediately following the Civil War.
Guadalupe County’s agricultural boom was to be short-lived, however. After the
Civil War, the area took a hard economic hit. In the mid 1870’s the railroad
arrived, reaching Seguin in 1876 and San Antonio the following year. This
allowed ranchers and farmers to get their products to more markets with greater
ease and less risk of damage and helped pull the county out of an economic
depression. As the area recovered, cotton became a major crop, accounting for
12 percent of improved land in 1880 and 59 percent in 1900.
The
overproduction of cotton, followed by the Great Depression, forced residents to
turn to corn or focus on livestock, often the poultry industry.
In the forty years after 1870, the area saw a swell of immigrant arrivals. People
came from all over Europe and Mexico, joining the concentrated German
population in San Antonio and New Braunfels. Mexican immigrants increased
their share of the population in Guadalupe County from two percent in 1870 to
over 11 percent by 1910. The German influence remained strongest in the area,
however, bolstered by a continuous influx of new arrivals from Europe. Their
influence was so strong that the area saw some tension during the First World
War.
The economy of Guadalupe County changed to a degree as the Guadalupe River
was developed as a source of power in the late 1920’s and early 1930’s. Comal
County saw the rise of tourism, as parks along the river replaced mills. Oil was
discovered in the early 1920’s, further diversifying the economy. Although
agriculture never lost its dominant status for Guadalupe County, many people
who worked in San Antonio began choosing to live in the county as the
automobile and highway systems made longer commutes possible. This trend
continued into modern times as residents who worked elsewhere continued
moving into the area once reserved for farming and ranching. New Braunfels,
supported by manufacturing and tourism, saw a sustained 30 percent growth
rate in the decades following World War II, fueled by its proximity to San
Antonio.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Archival research for this project was conducted at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission.
One
previous archeological survey intersects the current project area. In 1998 a
transmission line survey was conducted for the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). This survey, which intersects the project area north of
Green Valley Road, extended from just north of the Guadalupe County line to
approximately three miles south. No archeological sites were recorded as a
result of this survey. According to records at TARL, there is one previously
recorded site within 1000 feet the project area. Site 41GU38 lies directly within
the proposed ROW approximately 1000 feet north of Green Valley Road. It was
recorded as a historic and prehistoric debris scatter during a 1995 transmission
line survey. A standing windmill was the only recorded feature. It was
recommended as ineligible for the National Register of Historic Places.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a pedestrian archeological survey
supplemented with shovel tests for the proposed FM 1044 improvements from
IH 35 to Weil Road, in Comal and Guadalupe Counties, Texas (Figure 1). Hicks
& Company’s intensive survey of the project area was designed and performed in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s minimum survey standards
for linear projects, which requires 16 shovel tests per mile, per 100 feet of width.
Additionally, no fewer than six shovel tests were excavated at each archeological
site location in order to delineate site boundaries relative to the project right-of­
way and evaluate the site in terms of context, depth, artifact content, and
definitive characteristics. All excavated soil was screened through ¼-inch wire
mesh. Each shovel test was recorded in 10-centimeter levels on standardized
forms and plotted onto a site sketch map and/or an aerial photograph of the
project area. The walls and bottom of each shovel test were cleaned with a
trowel to examine the stratigraphy and any evidence of historic and prehistoric
activity and a soil profile was recorded for each shovel test. Once these data
were recorded, all of the shovel tests were backfilled. The results of each shovel
test were documented through standardized forms, field notes, and
photographs.
Areas of disturbance were noted and recorded through
photographs. As stated in the scope of work, all artifacts recovered during
survey were subject to field analysis, recorded, and then replaced where they
were recovered; investigators were to collect diagnostic artifacts only during
survey, however, no diagnostic artifacts were encountered. All newly recorded
archeological sites and revisited sites data were submitted electronically to TARL
for inclusion in their database.
The investigators inventoried all parcels of land where right-of-entry was granted
by the landowner (Figures 2 and 3); those parcels where investigators did not
have right-of-entry access were not surveyed during the current study.
Although right-of-entry was not obtained for parcels 25 and 26, the disturbance
documented in this area, immediately south of IH 35 on Rueckle Road, makes it
highly unlikely that intact cultural deposits would be encountered here (Figures
4 and 5). These properties were observed from the roadside, and it is
recommended that no additional investigation is necessary. Of the 64 shovel
tests excavated, four were positive for cultural material, at Site 41CM301, and at
Site 41GU38. Investigators also recorded one new historic site that lies
immediately outside of the FM 1044 right-of-way. Site 41CM302 is an 1845
brick farmhouse with associated artifacts. In addition to these sites, one
isolated prehistoric artifact was identified. This was a tested chert cobble,
located in the rolling upland area between Weil Road and Green Valley Road.
The area was thoroughly inspected, however, no additional artifacts were

Archeological Survey – FM 1044 – August 2007

15

CSJ# 2021-01-009

recovered. Investigation documented areas containing modern and natural
disturbance during the pedestrian survey and shovel testing.
The field survey started near the southern terminus of the project area on
additional property, adjacent to the existing FM 1044 right-of-way.
Archeologists continued surveying in a northerly direction, with the project
ending at the northern terminus at the IH 35 access road.
The southern portion of the project begins just south of Weil Road with
approximately 50 feet (15 m) of additional property added on to each side of the
existing FM 1044 corridor. Right-of-entry was only permitted for the additional
property on the west side of FM 1044. North of Weil Road, the new corridor
gradually turns to the northwest away from the current FM 1044 corridor. With
the exception of a small jog to the west, and back again to the east near the
county line, the remainder of the new right-of-way follows a direct line until its
termination at the intersection of Rueckle Road and IH 35. The project crosses
upland pastures and undeveloped land for most of its length with business and
residential properties located along Rueckle Road just south of IH 35. Shovel
tests were excavated throughout the project area and pedestrian survey was
used when side slopes or disturbed areas were encountered.
Extensive modern disturbance was documented photographically at the
northern project terminus, immediately south of the IH 35 access road (Figures
4 and 5). These properties are either residential or commercial and have been
severely disturbed due to road and driveway construction as well as
underground utilities routing. For this reason, the additional right-of-way
within these disturbed areas was not shovel tested. It is recommended that no
additional investigation is necessary for parcels 25 and 26, for which permission
to enter was not obtained. The existing FM 1044 right-of-way at the southern
end of the project area was also not tested due to disturbance including the road
itself, transmission line poles, and underground utilities (Figure 6). Additional
disturbance was noted throughout the project area at road crossings and on
private properties, typically due to stock pond construction (Figures 7 and 8).

Shovel tests excavated within the right-of-way revealed shallow soils within the
project area. It is entirely within an upland environmental setting. For this
reason, no backhoe trenches were excavated within the proposed project
corridor. Navigation along the proposed right-of-way was guided by a Trimble
XT GPS unit and detailed aerial maps. All GPS positions were downloaded and
plotted on aerial maps and USGS Topographical quads by Hicks & Company
GIS personnel.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
Site 41CM301 is a prehistoric site located within the proposed FM 1044 rightof-way (Figure 9). The site is situated immediately adjacent to Rueckle Road in
the front yard of a private residence. The site consists of one flake and one
crude unifacial tool that were recovered from a single shovel test.
Site
dimensions are 65.5 feet (20 m) north to south by 50 feet (15 m) east to west.
The site was bounded by a lack of cultural material to the north, south, east,
and west. A total of six shovel tests were excavated in the site area, with only
one being positive for cultural artifacts (Table 1). Artifacts were recovered from
no greater than 10 centimeters (4 inches) below the ground surface, and neither
of the identified artifacts was temporally diagnostic. Vegetation at the site
consists of short grasses. Investigators observed approximately 15-20% ground
surface visibility within the site area (Figure 10). Because of its location, Site
41CM301 may be a result of secondary deposition. The shovel test excavated
nearest to Rueckle Road (SS19), revealed disturbed sediment including a

CSJ# 2021-01-009

number of chert gravels from the surface to its termination at 25 centimeters (10
inches) below surface. Investigators also noted a slight rise in the ground
surface as the property approaches Rueckle road, to the east. This area may
have been artificially built up when the road was constructed. It is possible that
the observed artifacts were unintentionally transported with gravels utilized
during road construction. A typical soil profile in undisturbed context on Site
41CM301 consisted of (10Y4/2) dark grayish brown silty clay from 0-15
centimeters below surface, over (2.5Y 7/4) pale yellow silt, terminating at caliche
at approximately 30 centimeters (1 foot) below surface. No further investigation
is recommended for Site 41CM301.

Figure 10: 41CM301 General Site Area

Site 41CM302 is a large, simple rectangle plan, one-story house which dates to
1845. The low-pitch, side-gable roof is covered with weathered corrugated metal
(Figure 11). The building is of masonry construction, utilizing either hand-made
bricks or limestone. Despite years of covering the material with stucco, the
coating is spalling in places, revealing portions of original and repaired
brickwork. Other features of the structure include a three-quarters width front
porch that is included under the continuous slope of the side-gable roof. The
porch decking and posts are wood construction, as is the enclosure of the fourth
bay along this elevation. The visible windows on the north elevation consist of

22

CSJ# 2021-01-009

six-over-six wood sash windows with brick arched lintels. Based on a number of
factors, it appears that this residence is associated with the early German
settlement of the county. The form, roofline, porch orientation, materials and
placement of both windows and doors are all very similar to other early
residences built by German settlers. The house is depicted on the 1936 Comal
County Highway map.
Figure 11: 41CM302 1845 Brick House

This homesite is located at 168 Rueckle Road, approximately 1,722 feet (525 m)
south of the IH 35 access road, on the west side of the proposed FM 1044
alignment. Because this site is located outside of the APE for this project, no
formal investigation of the property was conducted. However, investigators
observed artifacts on the ground surface approaching the standing structure.
The yard has also been decorated with a variety of historic-age farming
implements (Figure 12). In addition to the brick house, there is a board-and­
batten style outbuilding with a corrugated metal roof located approximately 65.5
feet (20 m) to the north (Figure 13). This structure is surrounded by historic
and modern debris. Estimated site dimensions are 328 feet (100 m) north to
south by 164 feet (50 m) east to west. The surrounding area is upland pasture,
with low grasses and scattered mesquite trees. The yard immediately around
the brick house, which appears to still be in use as a residence, is covered in low
turf grass with several hardwood trees near the structures. An estimated 30­
50% of the ground surface is visible in the area surrounding the house.
According to the Soil Survey of Comal and Hays Counties (Batte 1984), soil on
the site consists of Heiden clay, on 1-3% slopes. A typical soil profile from

Archeological Survey – FM 1044 – August 2007

CSJ# 2021-01-009

nearby shovel tests consisted of (10YR 4/2) Dark grayish brown, very compact
silty clay to approximately 1 foot (30 cm) below surface, over (2.5Y 6/3) Light
yellowish brown clay with caliche. These shovel tests were terminated due to
very dense clay with a high caliche content. Further survey that would include
shovel testing and archival research to determine ownership and occupation
history is recommended for Site 41CM302, if it is ever impacted by future
construction.

Site 41GU38 is a multiple component, historic and prehistoric site that was
revisited as a part of the current FM 1044 investigations. However, no right-of­
entry was permitted to the property containing the historic component. Site
41GU38 was recorded as a historic and prehistoric debris scatter during a 1995
transmission line survey. A standing windmill was the only recorded feature,
and it was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The current
investigations observed an historic age house as part of the site, however, this
was located on property for which right-of-entry was denied. The house is
depicted on the 1936 Guadalupe County highway map. During the current field
investigations, seven shovel tests were excavated approaching a hilltop
immediately adjacent to the property on which the windmill is located (Figure
14). Of these seven shovel tests, three were positive for prehistoric lithic
debitage (Table 2). No artifacts were recovered beyond 15 centimeters (6 inches)
below surface, and the shallow caliche bedrock encountered in shovel tests rules
out the possibility of deeply buried cultural material. In addition to artifacts
observed within the shovel tests, one crude unifacial tool was observed on the
surface along with scattered lithic debitage, at a density of approximately one
flake per fifty square meters. Although the area shovel tested was approximately
197 feet (60 m) north to south by 131 feet (40 m) east to west, the estimated
overall site size is 984 feet (300 m) north to south by 197 feet (60 m) east to
west. The site is bounded by a lack of cultural material to the north and east,
and the extent of observable historic material to the south. The western
boundary is unknown, but determined based on the previous site recording.
Vegetation at the site consists of short, patchy grasses and Roosevelt weed

(Figure 15). Investigators observed approximately 10-20% ground surface
visibility within the site area. A typical soil profile on the site consisted of
(10Y3/2) Very dark grayish brown silty clay over caliche, which was encountered
between five and 25 centimeters (2-10 inches) below surface. On the property to
the east of the right-of-way, adjacent to the windmill and previously recorded
historic debris scatter, investigators observed historic glass, and although
visibility was severely limited due to thick vegetation along the property
boundary, a small area that was raised slightly from the surrounding surface
elevation. This could potentially be the remains of a collapsed structure or other
historic feature. No further investigation is recommended for the portions of Site
41GU38 for which right-of-entry was obtained for the current survey. If
permission is obtained to enter the property prior to construction of the new FM
1044 alignment, than it is recommended that intensive survey including shovel
testing and archival research be performed on the historic component of the site.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists surveyed approximately two miles of new
location roadway for the proposed 4.5 realignment of FM 1044, wherever right of
entry to private property was available. The survey involved pedestrian survey
and 64 shovel tests, only four of which were positive for cultural material.
Existing rights-of-way were visually inspected and documented through notes
and photos.
Surveyors documented rolling rangeland and farmland,
characterized by thin stony soils consisting of loams and clay loams. One
previously recorded site (41GU38) was partially investigated, where right of entry
was available, and two sites (41CM301, 41CM302) were newly recorded as part
of this survey.
The project was conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit and in compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act. All work conformed
to 36 CFR 800, outlining the guidelines for implementing Section 106, and the
Texas Historical Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure for the
Antiquities Code of Texas under 13 TAC 26. Sites were evaluated with respect to
36 CFR 60.4, which specifies the criteria for determining National Register
eligibility, and with respect to State Archeological Landmark eligibility under the
Antiquities Code.
Site 41GU38 is a multi-component archeological site characterized by a thin
surficial lithic scatter and historic farmstead. The majority of the historic
component is located on private property for which the landowners denied right
of entry. Therefore it could not be fully investigated or assessed as part of this
survey. Based on observations made over the fence, however, the historic
component includes a late nineteenth century farmhouse and a windmill, and
possibly additional features such as a cistern or trash accumulations. The
prehistoric component that was investigated consists of a thin surface scatter of
debitage, much of which could possibly have formed through natural or nonarcheological processes such as weather spalling or tractor damage. Seven
shovel tests were excavated at Site 41GU38 where investigators had permission
from private landowners. Three of these contained debitage in the upper ten
centimeters of the tests. No intact features, organic archeological material, or
diagnostic artifacts were observed. The portion of Site 41GU38 investigated
during this survey is recommended as ineligible for the National Register of
Historic Places and as an SAL. However, the portion of 41GU38 on private
property not investigated as part of this survey should be evaluated through
shovel tests once right-of-way acquisition for the roadway has begun.
Site 41CM301 is a very light prehistoric lithic scatter characterized by a chert
flake and a unifacial tool found on the surface. The site is located on a

Archeological Survey – FM 1044 – August 2007

29

CSJ# 2021-01-009

topographic high point in the surrounding landscape, in the front yard of a
residence. Due to very sparse artifact recovery, lack of intact feature remains
and lack of contextual integrity, the site is recommended as ineligible for the
National Register of Historic Places and as an SAL.
Site 41CM302 is an historic age farmhouse, constructed in 1845. The one-story
house is built of brick covered with plaster. The style is a rectangular plan
house with a central hall flanked by two or four rooms on either side, typical of
the mid-nineteenth century. A visual inspection of the ground surface close to
the house suggests that historic artifacts are present in the yard and that intact
archeological deposits from the mid-nineteenth century could be found. The
house and its associated yard are outside the project right-of-way and will not
be directly impacted by the project, therefore, no shovel testing was conducted
around the house. The house is eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places under Criterion A. It may also be eligible under Criterion D, however,
investigators were not able to definitively assess this since the house and yard
are outside the right-of-way and right of entry was not available. It is
recommended that should future impacts occur, archival research and thorough
shovel testing to assess the integrity and significance of the archeological
deposits should be conducted.
None of the properties inspected contained NRHP/SAL eligible archeological
sites or components. However, investigators were only able to inspect roughly
50% of the APE due to limited right-of-entry. It is recommended that all
properties inspected as part of this survey should be allowed to proceed to
construction, relative to the requirements under Section 106 and the Antiquities
Code of Texas (see Figures 2 and 3). Properties within the APE for which right­
of-entry was unavailable at the time of survey should be assessed with respect
to Section 106 and the Antiquities Code of Texas once right-of-way acquisition
has occurred, prior to the initiation of construction activities.
