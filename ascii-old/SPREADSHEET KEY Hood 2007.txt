SPREADSHEET KEY
Basic data
Each sherd number was recorded (lot# and sherd #), as well as the weight, and the longest and
shortest axes of each sherd. Sherd thickness was measured. Variability of sherd thickness was
determined by taking three measurements. If they varied from one another more than 1
millimeter, thickness was recorded as being variable (Y=yes N=no).
Diameter
Most sherds in 41GV66, 41AU38, and 41LB4 were not large enough to provide accurate
measurements of orifice or vessel diameter. Thus, many cells in these fields are blank.
Orifice diameter
The diameter of the orifice was measured using a metric template and was expressed in
centimeters. This was only done with rim sherds that were large enough to provide a reasonably
accurate result.
Body diameter
Body diameter was measured on body sherds greater than or equal to 50 millimeters using a
micrometer that provided both chord length and the length of the curve. The spreadsheet for
41AU38 lacks these four columns because no sherds were large enough to measure. The
following measurements and calculations were recorded: length of curve (measurement),
difference between length of curve and the “zero” or tare setting on the micrometer (which in
this case was 18 millimeters—a calculation), chord length (measurement) and the diameter of the
sherd (calculation). All measurements are expressed in millimeters.
Sherd color
The dominant color of the exterior of each sherd was described using a Munsell soil color chart.
Firing Core
The firing core of each sherd was described as: 1=reduced, 2=oxidized, 3=reduced and oxidized
portions found on different locations of sherd.
Inclusions: abundance and size
The abundance (“abund” on the spreadsheets) and size of aplastic inclusions in each sherd was
described as a frequency where: 0=none, 1= (<50%), 2=50%, 3= (>50%). Sand, grog, and bone
inclusions were noted, as well as “other” inclusions where: C=calcium carbonate, F=ferric
concretion, H=hematite, S=shell, U=unidentified.
Inclusion size
Size and sorting of aplastic inclusions was expressed as 0=none, 1=1/16-1/8mm in diameter,
2=1/8-1/4mm in diameter, 3=1/4mm and greater, 4=size classes 1 and 2, 5=size classes 2 and 3,
6=size classes 1, 2, and 3, and 7= size classes 1 and 3. These observations were made using a
binocular microscope at 10X magnification.

Location of sherd on vessel (“Location”)
Is expressed as: 1=rim, 2=neck, 3=shoulder, 4=body, 5=base.

Use-wear and surface treatments
Attributes relating to use-wear and surface treatments were recorded using the following scale to
describe their frequency:
0=none
1= (<25%)
2=(>25<50%)
3=(>50%<75%)
4=(>75%<100%)
5=100%
Observations were made on the interior (“int”) and exterior (“ex”) of the sherd. When not
indicated, observations were made on the exterior of the sherd.
Spalling (“spall”)
After Hally 1983.
Dark areas (“dk”)
After Hally 1983 and Skibo 1992.
Scratches (“Scr”)
After Skibo 1992.

Mending (“Mend”)
Here the frequency scale above was not used. In this column: 0=none, 1=drilled hole(s), 2=clay
patching, 3=asphaltum on or near a crack or break.
Asphaltum residue (“tar”)
Burnishing (“Burn”)
After Rice 1987.
Combing (“Comb”)
Red Film (“Film”)
After Aten 1983.
Incising
Punctation (“Punctate”)
Stamping
Striations from wiping or scraping wet vessel (“stri”)
After Ellis 1992 and Rye 1981.
Comments
Comments include notes of sherds that were glued together or had unique characteristics. In the
case of 41AU38, this column includes the original sorting of the analysis from the 1974 test
excavations—this collection is still sorted that way; I simply entered and used the sorting as a
tool to easily locate individual sherds when working with the collections.
