ABSTRACT
On July 30 and 31, 2015, archeologists from aci consulting conducted an intensive cultural
resource survey of the West Travis County Public Utility Agency Raw Water Transmission
Main in Bee Cave, Travis County, Texas. The proposed project is sponsored by the West
Travis County Public Utility Agency (WTCPUA). This work was conducted in compliance
with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Texas Antiquities Code permit
number 7354 as well as Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended, for compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for any impacts to US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) potentially regulated waters.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of a 50-foot (15 meter) right-of-way (ROW) of
four route alternatives, for a total of 33.5 acres (13.5 hectares) of survey. The four alternative
alignments are located between Bee Cave Road and the Colorado River. The majority of the
routes were along previously disturbed areas within the Lake Pointe subdivision or within the
wooded canyon land to the west and north. No new archeological sites were recorded during
the survey. Based on these results, no further archeological work is recommended. Julie
Shipp served as Principal Investigator for this project. Records from this project will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the for the West Travis County Public Utility
Agency Raw Water Transmission Main in Travis County, Texas
August 2015
1.0

INTRODUCTION

This cultural resource survey was conducted for the West Travis County Public Utility
Agency (WTCPUA) Raw Water Transmission Main project in Travis County, Texas. The
Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of the 50-foot (15-meter) right-of-way (ROW) of
four route alternatives, for a total of 33.5 acres (13.5 hectares) of survey. The four alternative
alignments are located between Bee Cave Road and the Colorado River (Figures 1 and 2) and
are described below.
Alternate 1
Alternate 1 (8.1 acres) (3.27 hectares), the preferred alternative, is approximately 1.3 miles
(2.1 kilometers) in length. Alternate 1 begins approximately 1,775 feet (541 meters) north of
the intersection of Pleasant Panorama View and Sea Eagle View at the existing raw water
intake on the south bank of the Colorado River in mostly undeveloped canyon lands.
Alternate 1 extends south/southwest for approximately 1,600 feet (487 meters), then
southeast for approximately 1,120 feet (341 meters), then generally trends southeast toward
the intersection of Bee Cave Road and Resaca Boulevard for approximately 4,213 feet (1284
meters). Alternate 1 ties in to the existing water line on the north side of Bee Cave Road,
approximately 114 feet (35 meters) southwest from the intersection of Bee Cave Road and
Resaca Boulevard. Alternates 1, 2, and 4 tie into the existing water line within Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) ROW on the north side of Bee Cave Road. Those
locations were previously surveyed in 2010 (Hixson et al. 2011).
Alternate 2
Alternate 2 (7.9 acres) (3.2 hectares) is approximately 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) in length.
Alternate 2 begins approximately 1,775 (541 meters) feet north of the intersection of Pleasant
Panorama View and Sea Eagle View at the existing raw water intake on the south bank of the
Colorado River. Alternate 2 extends south/southwest for approximately 3,887 feet (1,184
meters) in undeveloped canyon lands, then parallels the western border of residential
neighborhoods backyards along Carlsbad Drive and Napa Drive for approximately 2,278 feet
(694 meters) before extending south for approximately 675 feet (205 meters) along Santee
Drive and extends to the intersection of Bee Cave Road and Santee Drive, where it ties in to
the existing water line on the north side of Bee Cave Road.

Alternate 3
Alternate 3 (8.2 acres) (3.3 hectares) is a total of approximately 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers).
Alternate 3 begins approximately 1,775 feet (541 meters) north of the intersection of Pleasant
Panorama View and Sea Eagle View at the existing raw water intake on the south bank of the
Colorado River. Alternate 3 extends south for approximately 122 feet (37 meters), then
southwest for approximately 90 linear feet (27 meters), then south toward the intersection of
Pleasant Panorama View and Sea Eagle View for approximately 1,792 feet (546 meters)
before paralleling Sea Eagle View for approximately 1,228 feet (375 meters). Alternate 3
then spurs southeast for approximately 435 feet (132 meters) and extends south along Resaca
Boulevard for approximately 3,473 linear feet (1,058 meters) before intersecting Bee Cave
Road at the intersection of Resaca Boulevard and Bee Cave Road, where it ties in to the
existing water line on the north side of Bee Cave Road. The majority of this line is located in
existing road ROW of Lake Pointe subdivision.
Alternate 4
Alternate 4 (9.3 acres) (3.76 hectares) is a total of approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) in
length. Alternate 4 begins approximately 1,775 feet (541 meters) north of the intersection of
Pleasant Panorama View and Sea Eagle View at the existing raw water intake on the north
bank of the Colorado River. Alternate 4 extends south for approximately 122 feet (37
meters), then southwest for approximately 90 feet (27 meters), then south toward the
intersection of Pleasant Panorama View and Sea Eagle View for approximately 1,792 feet
(564 meters) . Alternate 4 then parallels Pleasant Panorama View heading east for
approximately 1,660 feet (505 meters), then parallels Resaca Boulevard for approximately
4,446 (1,355) feet heading south before intersecting Bee Cave Road near the intersection of
Resaca Boulevard and Bee Cave Road, where it ties in to the existing water line on the north
side of Bee Cave Road. The majority of this line is located in existing road ROW of Lake
Pointe subdivision.
The project is conducted for the WTCPUA in compliance with the Texas Administrative
Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) as well as Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended, for any additional compliance for impacts to US Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) regulated waters. The investigation consisted of an intensive pedestrian
survey in accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas
Archaeologists (CTA) standards. Julie Shipp served as Principal Investigator for this project.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

2.1 Environmental Setting
The project area is located in Central Texas along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau in
the Balcones Canyonlands (Griffith et al. 2007). The Balcones Canyonlands are
approximately 1000 feet higher in elevation than the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east. Erosion
along the edge of the Edwards Plateau has resulted in steep, stair-step topography
characterized by canyons, sinkholes, and karsts. The Balcones Canyonlands are relatively
well watered in comparison to the larger Edwards Plateau and the Blackland Prairie to the
east. The climate in Travis County is temperate, humid, subtropical. Average annual
temperature is 69ºF (20.5ºC); average maximum high is 97ºF (36ºC) occurring in July;
average maximum low is 35ºF (1.6ºC) occurring in January.
The relative abundance of moisture and the varied elevations within the canyonlands have
resulted in diverse habitats which have led to high species diversity and the continued
presence of endemic and endangered species. Habitats include riparian forests and deciduous
north slope forests as well as drought tolerant evergreen woodlands. Oak savanna and
remnants of grasslands are found in the canyon divides. Primary game species are the white
tailed deer and Rio Grande wild turkey. Exotic game and wild boar are also present and
compete with native species (Griffith et al. 2007).
2.2 Geology and Soils
The Bureau of Economic Geology (Barnes 1974) classified the general surface geology of
the subject area as being primarily dominated by the Glen Rose Formation (Kgr). This group
is described by Barnes (1974):
“Limestone dolomite, and marl subdivided into two units by Corbula bed
C; alternating resistant and recessive beds forming stairstep topography;
limestone aphanitic to fine grained, hard to soft and marly, light gray to
yellowish gray; dolomite, fine grained, porous, yellowish brown; marine
megafossils include molluscan steinkerns, rudistids oysters, and echinoids;
upper part, relatively thinner bedded, more dolomitic, and less
fossiliferous than the lower part, thickness about 200 feet; lower part more
massive and about 160 feet thick, includes at top Corbula bed, C, with
abundant steinkerns of Corbula Harvey (Hill) in an interval up to 5 feet
thick; thickness of Glen Rose Formation 380 +/- feet.”
The soils within the APE are mapped as Brackett, Tarrant and Rock outcrop, and Tarrant and
Speck (NRCS 2015) (Figure 3). All of the soils are very shallow and, in some cases, are rock
outcrops. Brackett soils are shallow, gravelly, calcareous, loamy soils overlying interbedded

limestone and marl. Tarrant soils are very shallow, stony, calcareous, clayey soils
intermingled with shallow soils overlying limestone. The Speck-Tarrant association is
described as shallow, stony, loamy soils and very shallow, stony, clayey soils overlying
limestone.






Brackett soils, rolling (BlD) - Found along undulating to rolling topography over
interbedded limestone and marl in individual areas over 1,000 acres in size. The
surface layer is made up of 75% broken limestone fragments, with the addition to
gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, loam or clay loam. It is shallow and well drained
and the permeability is moderately slow with a low water capacity.
Tarrant and Speck soils, 0 to 2 percent slopes (TcA) - These soils occupy various
portions of ridges including long, narrow, broad and irregular areas, with a range of
50 to 750 acres (20 to 303 hectares) in size. Tarrant soils surface layer of this soil is
10 inches (25 cm) thick consisting dark grayish-brown gravelly clay with underlying
limestone fragments. Speck soils have a surface layer of reddish-brown clay loam
about 14 inches (35 cm) thick, with the next lower layer being 4 inches (17 cm) of
dark reddish-brown gravelly clay. The underlying material is hard limestone. They
are slowly permeable with a low available water capacity and are shallow and well
drained.
Tarrant soils and Rock outcrop, steep (TdF) - This soil group occupies breaks and
ravines along major rivers. This soil type has a surface layer of dark grayish-brown
stony clay or stony clay loam about 7 inches (17cm) thick over limestone. Rock
outcrop and smaller loose limestone fragments cover 50 to 80 percent of the acreage.
It is slowly permeable with a low available water capacity and is shallow and well
drained.

2.3 Prehistoric Background
The property falls within the Central Texas archeological region (Collins 1995). Prehistoric
archeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous human occupation starting around
11,500 years ago. Michael B. Collins (1995) authored a synthesis of Central Texas
archeology in which he divides the prehistory of Central Texas into three periods: (1) the
Paleoindian, (2) the Archaic, and (3) the Late Prehistoric. Each of these is further divided into
subperiods, such as early and late. Dates are presented as Before Present or BP in Table 1.
Table 1. Regional prehistoric chronology of central Texas

11,500-8,800 BP

Middle
6,000-4,000 BP
Late

Late Prehistoric
1,200-500 BP
Historic
500 BP +

The Paleoindian period dates between approximately 11,500 and 8,800 BP (Collins
1995:381-3). The Early Paleoindian in Central Texas is part of a larger, regional cultural
horizon, the Clovis horizon. Clovis sites record a general hunter-gatherer lifeway based upon
a wide variety of fauna including large herbivores as well as smaller animals. Evidence of
plant resources is less common, but it is presumed that local flora were also important to
subsistence. In contrast, later Folsom sites indicate a greater reliance upon big game hunting.
The Late Paleoindian seems transitional between the Paleoindian and Archaic in that burned
rock features are present, but they are not as large or ubiquitous as those associated with the
Archaic. Other artifacts, features, and faunal remains seem more similar to those found later
in the Archaic.
Archaic (Collins 1995:383-385) sites in Central Texas are most often associated with the use
of heated rock in hearths, ovens, middens, and scatters. The period as a whole is defined by
the intensified use of local resources and diversity of material culture in comparison to the
Paleoindian period. The climate ranged from mesic (relatively moist) in the Early Archaic
and the later part of the Late Archaic to xeric (relatively dry) during the Middle Archaic and
beginning of the Late Archaic. Subsistence during mesic times is centered on the live-oak
savanna, while a shift in emphasis toward xerophytes may have occurred during xeric
intervals.

The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups, primarily from the
Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics into the archeological record takes
place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans inland from the
coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
2.4 Historic Background
Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca and the remaining survivors of the Narvaez expedition were
the first Europeans known to have set foot in modern-day Texas; they landed on the Texas
coast following a shipwreck in 1528 (Chipman 1992). Between 1528 and the late 1600s,
Spanish excursions into Texas were limited. The first European known to enter Travis
County was Domingo Terán de los Ríos during a reconnaissance tour. Later Spanish
incursions recorded insightful information on various Native American tribes, collectively
referred to as the Coahuiltecans, who at one point lived in the area around modern-day San
Antonio. Late seventeenth century accounts describe these people as family units of hunter
gatherers that resided near streams and springs, in areas conducive to nut harvesting. These
camps were revisited on a seasonal basis, allowing interaction with different groups along the
way as well as the hunting of bison in open grassland settings (Campbell 1983; Hester 1989).
By the eighteenth century, the cultural integrity of these native groups was significantly
compromised by European settlers and invasive neighboring Native American groups, such
as the Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache, made possible through access to European horses.
Efficiently skilled Comanche horsemen, in turn, displaced the Lipan Apache culture,
continuously raiding European and Native American settlements alike in Central Texas
(Hester 1989). In response to the continuous threat of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well
as the French incursion into East Texas, a series of Spanish missions and presidios were
erected along the San Antonio River during the eighteenth century. The Spanish governor of
Coahuila and Texas, the Marques de San Miguel de Aguayo, established San Antonio as the
focus of European settlement (Cox 1997). Anglo-American settlement in the area began with
numerous land grants from Mexico following its independence from Spain in 1821.
Mirabeau Lamar, while serving as President of the Republic of Texas, wanted to locate a site
where a new capital city for Texas could be planned, based on the layout of Washington D.C.
at the time. While hunting buffalo with a Ranger detachment in 1838, Lamar camped at the
small settlement of Waterloo at the confluence of Shoal Creek and the Colorado River. The
ambience of the location impressed Lamar, and the site was chosen over Mina (Bastrop) as
the new capital of Texas. The new capital of Waterloo was renamed after Stephen F. Austin
in 1839. Travis County was named after William Barret Travis, who perished defending the
Alamo in 1836. Texas prospered as an independent republic for ten years, eventually joining
the United States in 1845. The Civil War proved detrimental to Austin’s economy, but
conditions improved during the 1880s, particularly with the arrival of various rail roads
(Smyrl 2012a).

The proposed project is located just to the west of the city of Bee Cave, about twelve miles
west of Austin. Bee Cave was aptly named after a local cave that was home to wild bees.
Prior to a population increase beginning in the 1980s, Bee Cave was home to few residents.
In the mid-1880s, the recorded population was 20. By 1914, there were 54 residents and the
population remained at approximately this level until 1990 when the population increased to
over 200 residents. At last count, Bee Cave was home to 656 residents in 2000. The Bee
Cave post office opened in 1871 and then closed in 1915 when residents received mail
through Cedar Valley. In the mid-1880s, records indicate that Bee Cave was home to a steam
gristmill, cotton gin, general store, church, and school. Bee Cave currently has its own school
district, parks, recreational facilities, and library (Smyrl 2012b).

LITERATURE REVIEW

A literature review of the THC Archeological Sites Database (the Atlas) indicated no
previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted and no previous archeological
sites have been recorded within the APE. However, five archeological sites have been
previously recorded within one kilometer of the APE (Table 2; Figure 4). Neither of the
sites have yet been determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) nor have been designated as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The
types of sites that are typically recorded in the area are mussel shell middens, open
campsites, or historic homesteads.

construction of the West Travis County Water Plant Expansion by the LCRA (Malof et
al. 2005). Site 41TV2124 was also recorded by the LCRA prior to installation of the
West Travis County Pipeline (Hixson et al. 2006). Site 41TV2375 was discovered during
a survey conducted prior to construction of the Bee Caves Wastewater Line also
conducted by the LCRA (Hixson et al. 2011). Records for the sites 41TV565 and
41TV1286 have limited information that does not include references to reports or
determinations of eligibility for either listing on the NRHP or designation as a SAL.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION

4.1 Survey Method
A 100% pedestrian survey of the 33.5-acre (13.5-hectare) APE was conducted to locate any
archeological sites or other historical properties that may be adversely affected by the
construction of the raw water transmission main. Shovel tests were to be excavated in
settings that had potential for buried cultural horizons and/or if the ground surface visibility
is less than 30 percent. However, due to shallow soils, greater than 30 percent ground
visibility, slope, and previous disturbances, no shovel tests were necessary. The survey was
conducted in two transects 15 meters apart with in the APE. Data collection during the
survey consisted of photography of the alignment, photo log, and daily journal entries.
4.2 Reporting and Curation
A draft report following CTA and THC guidelines will be submitted to the client for review
and comment. After the draft report has been reviewed and the comments addressed, a final
report will be prepared for submission to the THC. Following confirmation of THC
concurrence with the report, final copies of the report (a hard copy and a CD containing a
tagged .pdf file of the restricted version of the report) will be submitted to the THC. A
minimum of eleven hard copies of the public version of the report will be distributed to
university based libraries and archeological research facilities in Texas. The Antiquities
Permit will be completed upon the submission of the final copies of the report and the
Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology form. Project records and two hard copies of the
restricted version of the report will be curated at TARL in accordance with TARL curation
requirements per Antiquities Permit requirements. No artifacts will be curated as part of this
permit.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

On July 30 and 31, 2015, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural resource
survey of the Bee Cave Utility Raw Transmission Main, which consisted of a 33.5-acre (13.5
hectares) pedestrian survey of four alternate routes, Alternates 1-4. The majority of the routes
were along previously disturbed areas within the Lake Pointe subdivision or within the
wooded canyon land to the west and north. No new archeological sites or other historic
properties were recorded during the investigation.
Alternate 1
Alternate 1 is the preferred alignment, and transects primarily through wooded canyon land
(Figure 5). The alignment extends southeast from the raw water intake on the Colorado River
for approximately 3,700 feet (1,126 meters) through canyon land. This section of Alternate 1
was primarily slope 30 percent or greater. Once the line reaches the neighborhood, it runs
along the backyards of the houses on Sterling Panorama Terrace until nearing Resaca
Boulevard. The line runs parallel to Resaca approximately 30 feet (9.1 meters) to the west
until the termination of the line at Bee Caves Road. Because of previous disturbance, slope,
and shallow soils, no shovel tests were dug on this alternate.

Alternate 2
Alternate 2 transects primarily through wooded canyon land, starting at the water intake and
transects southward along steep shoulder slope for approximately 3,800 feet (1,158 meters),
then parallels the western border of residential neighborhoods along Carlsbad Drive and
Napa Drive for approximately 2,278 feet (694 meters) before extending south for
approximately 675 feet (205 meters) along Santee Drive and extends to the intersection of
Bee Cave Road and Santee Drive, where it ties in to the existing water line on the north side
of Bee Cave Road. Because of previous disturbance, slope, and shallow soils, no shovel tests
were dug on this alternate.
Alternates 3 and 4
Alternate 3 and 4 (and 2) extend south from the water intake for approximately 2,000 feet
(609 meters) (Figure 6). Alternate 3 then runs along Sea Eagle View for approximately 1,228
feet (375 meters), and then spurs southeast for approximately 435 linear feet and extends
south along Resaca Boulevard for approximately 3,473 feet (1,058 meters) before it reaches
the intersection of Resaca Boulevard and Bee Cave Road, where it ties in to the existing
water line on the north side of Bee Cave Road. Alternate 4 parallels Pleasant Panorama View
rather the Sea Eagle View but is otherwise the same route as Alternate 3 (Figure 7). With the
exception of the section of the alternates that extend from the water intake to the subdivision,
which transect steep slope, the line is located within a road median or existing road ROW
within the subdivision. No shovel tests were excavated on Alternates 3 or 4.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In advance of construction of the proposed Bee Cave Utility Raw Water Transmission Main
project in Travis County, Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian
survey in accordance with CTA and THC guidelines. The APE consists of the 50-foot (15meter) ROW of four route alternatives, for a total of 33.5 acres (13.5 hectares) of survey.
This work was conducted in compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2])
under Texas Antiquities Code permit number 7354 as well as Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, for compliance with Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act for any impacts to US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) potentially regulated
waters. No new archeological sites were recorded. Based on these results, no further
archeological work is recommended.
It must be noted that no level of survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural
features within a project area. Therefore, should human remains or archeological resources
be discovered during the course of construction for this project, the client will cease
construction and contact a professional archeologist.
