Abstract
An archaeological survey of a new (AM) Broadcast Tower was performed for Trade
Media Corporation on July 23, 2009, by James Briscoe (Senior Archaeologist) of BCS.
The project is located on private unrestricted property in Brewster County, Texas. The
project is located on a high flat uplands on the northwest edge of the city of Alpine,
Texas. The area has been 100% disturbed by prior suburban construction activity.
The archaeological survey consisted of a standard Class III Cultural Resources Inventory
and was performed at the request of Dan Alpert on behalf of Trade Media Corporation.
Mr. Alpert, of the Law Office of Dan J. Alpert, can be reached at (703) 243-8690, 2120
North 21st Road, Arlington, Virginia 22201. The purpose of these investigations was to
ensure that cultural resources would not be disturbed by the project.
The project area was located on an empty house lot in a development started in the 1980s.
The area was originally cleared and bulldozed as a house lot, but was attached to the
adjoining house lot selected for construction. The tower is located at 401 West Marfa
Street on the northwest edge of the City of Alpine. No cultural resources were located in
the project area and there is little possibility of locating buried archaeological or
paleontological deposits. No cultural material was collected during these investigations
and project records will be temporarily stored at BCS until eventual transfer to the
Western History Collection at the University of Oklahoma. Archeological clearance is
being recommended.
This recommendation is subject to concurrence of the Texas Historical Commission.

Proposed Action
Trade Media Corporation is proposing to construct a new AM radio broadcast tower
(1490 KHz) tower site in Brewster County, Texas. The tower will be a 30.5 meter tall
self support structure. The tower itself will be inside a 190 X 190 foot fenced enclosure
within a 0.4 acre town lot. Access will be from a paved housing addition street on the
south side of the tract. For archaeological purposes, approximately 1.0 acre was included
in the survey. Access to adjoining house lots was restricted due to trespass issues.

Prefield Investigation and Records Check
The THC Archeological Site Atlas was viewed for any sites or surveys reported for the
area. No sites or surveys were discovered for the immediate area. The city of Alpine has
been studied for historical structures. Table 1 is appended to this report includes a
summary of structures within a mile of the proposed tower site. The closest structure is
located over half a mile to the southeast and no visual impacts will result from the
erection of the proposed new radio tower.
The National Register of Historical Places was also consulted. There are no properties
listed on the NRHP or that have been determined to be eligible for inclusion to the
Register in the immediate area.
There are no known sacred or culturally sensitive sites that fall under the American
Indian Freedom of Religion Act in the immediate project area.

Legal Description
The legal description is Lat 30-21-56.3/ Long 103-40-29.7 (NAD83).

USGS Map Source
The project is located on the USGS Alpine South 7.5 quadrangle (1972).

Land Jurisdiction
The project is located on private unrestricted lands in Brewster County, Texas. An FCC
permit is being submitted for operation of a new AM radio station.

Project and Inventory Area
The project area includes a tract of 0.1 acres, encompassing an empty house lot at 401
Marfa Street. For archaeological purposes, 1 acre was included in the area physically
inspected. Access to adjoining properties was limited and much of the survey was
confined to the tower site, street edges and nearby alleyways.

Environmental Description
The project is located in the eastern part of the Texas Trans Pecos physiographic region.
The tower site proper is located on an empty town lot within a newer addition on the
northwest side of the town of Alpine. The town of Alpine is within the valley of Alpine
Creek in the Davis Mountains. Vegetation is high desert scrub and mixed grasses. The
area demonstrates shallow disturbed surface deposits of brown loam (0 to 3cm deep) over
caliche clay beds. According to the Web Soil Survey, soils in the area are predominately
Musquiz clay loam found on flatter uplands. The overall area appears to have been used
for grazing and scrub pasturelands. The house lot is currently being used as open storage
by a construction contractor (the land owner). The tract was bulldozer cleared when the
housing development was started in the 1980s. One branch of Alpine Creek (Toronto
Creek) is located about half a mile to the north.

Cultural Setting
The Eastern Trans Pecos Region has been well studied over the past 100 years and the
reader is referred to Turpin (1995) for detailed regional information. The prehistoric
sequences for the region can be divided into Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric and
Historic periods. Within this context, this simplified version is commensurate with the
limited scale of this project.
Paleoindian Period
This period has been extensively studied in the western portions of Texas (see Johnson
1989, Sellards 1938, and Schultz 1943) and other sites. Refer to Hoffman (1989) for
detailed information. In the lower Pecos region, subperiods include the Aurora (ca.,
12,000 to 14,000 years ago), Bonfire (ca. 9,800 to 10, 700 years ago) and Oriente (ca.
9,000 to 9,400 years ago). The Aurora subperiod remains questionable but is supported
by burnt and seemingly butchered bones from larger Pleistocene animals.
Paleoindians in the region appear to have been Nomadic hunters and gathers that
followed the seasonally available resources and herds.
Archaic Period
The Archaic is divided into the Viejo subperiod (ca. 5500 to 8900 years ago), the Eagle
Nest subperiod (ca. 4100 to 5500 years ago), the San Felipe subperiod (ca. 3200 to 4100
years ago), Cibola subperiod (ca. 2300 to 3150 years ago), Flanders subperiod (ca. 2300
years ago) and Blue Hills subperiod (ca. 1300 to 2300 years ago). Many period/subpeiod
assignments are based on changes in rock art designs and much remains to be researched
before the sequence is well defined. Archaic sites in the region include cave and
rockshelter sites and small to large temporary camps on prominent points. During the
latter subperiod, desertification forced the local populations onto larger valley areas away
from the uplands areas that were intensely occupied earlier. More favorable conditions
after 2300 years ago allowed groups to reoccupy the surrounding uplands.
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric includes the Fletcha subperiod (ca. 450 to 1320 years ago) and
Infierno subperiod (ca. 250 to 450 years ago), generally attributed to the Jumano and
Cibolo tribes. Pottery and the first arrow point projectiles appear during the period but
the cultures are little different from the preceding period. Again, rock art is heavily relied
upon for identifying the subperiods.
The Jumanos and Cibolos were listed for the area by time of the first visits by the Spanish
explorers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The Historical Period
Spanish expeditions through the area begin with de Sosa in 1590. Reports by de Sosa
and subsequent visitors painted a picture of a bleak and unoccupied region, although
refugee groups lived in the area well into the 1800s. Punitive expeditions against
Comanche and Apache bands in the area were generally brief and of little value. Later
expeditions by the Republic of Texas and United States produced similar results. By the
time of the Love Expedition of 1850, the Chihuahua Trail was well established as a trade
route between northern Mexico and Texas, with traces leading to Chihuahua and El Paso
to San Antonio and points east.
A line of forts was established across the region beginning with Fort Bliss at El Paso in
1848, Fort Inge in 1849, Fort Clark in 1852, Fort Davis in 1854, Fort Lancaster in 1855,
and Forts Quitman and Stockton in 1858. The region was mostly abandoned during the
Civil War but was quickly reoccupied by 1870. A sea of grass through the region
attracted large scale ranching and the completion of the railroad through the area in 1882
brought small scale settlers, towns and businesses
Sometime in the 1800s, pastores from north-central New Mexico moved their flocks into
the region. The pastores (or shepherds) were originally from northern Mexico and
managed their own flocks with the assistance of their families. The pastores do not seem
to have had the same problems with the Comanche and Kiowa bands that were
experienced by the American travelers.

Field Methodology
The project area was covered by a series of traverses, walked in an ambling zigzag
fashion at 20 to 30 foot intervals. Access to adjoining properties was restricted and
surrounding areas were examined along public road edges and along two alleyways in the
area. Six shovel tests were dug in the project area. A handâheld GPS receiver, set to the
1927 NADA datum, was used to spot locate the test. Fill from the 30X30 cm test was
hand sifted through Â¼ inch screen before backfilling the hole.
Survey conditions were mild, dry, windy and sunny. The project was spot located by the
landowner and there were no impediments to the survey.

Paleontological Resources
No vertebrate paleontological resources were noted during the course of this
archaeological investigation.

7

Native American Concerns
No known areas that would fall under the realm of the American Indian Freedom of
Religion Act, Native American Graves Repatriation Act and other State and Federal
guidelines protecting graves and sacred areas are located within the immediate study
area.

Cultural Resources
No historic or prehistoric archaeological sites were noted during the course of this
investigation. All of the structures identified during a neighborhood survey (within half a
mile of the proposed tower location) were examined for reference to potential visual
impacts.

Recommendations
No significant cultural resources were located in the project area and there is no
possibility of locating buried archaeological and paleontological deposits. The proposed
tower will have no visual impacts on structures older than 50 years. Archaeological
clearance is being recommended.
This recommendation is subject to concurrence of the Texas Historical Commission.

Professional Estimations
In the professional opinion of James Briscoe, Principle Investigator for these
investigations, these investigations and recommendations comply with Federal guidelines
and standards for archaeological performance in the State Of Texas.
