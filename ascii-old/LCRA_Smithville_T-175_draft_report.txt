MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing a rebuild of its existing T-175 Smithville-toWinchester transmission line in Bastrop, Fayette, and Lee counties (Figure 1-Figure 4). The transmission
line is approximately 14.6 miles (23.5 kilometers [km]) in length and occupies a 100-foot (ft) (30-meter
[m]) wide easement, totaling 177 acres. The project will consist of the removal of 113 existing support
structures and replacing H-frames with 110 single poles. The new structures will be in placed in new
locations, and a 30- to 36-inch auger will be employed to drill the new holes to depths of over 6 ft. Other
impacts may involve the modification of the banks of intermittent streams to improve existing vehicle
crossings.
The majority of the T-175 transmission line has not been subjected to prior archaeological investigations,
so a cultural resources assessment was necessary. The assessment consisted of a map and file review
followed by an intensive cultural resources survey of high probability areas (HPA), both prehistoric and
historic, that could be impacted by construction activities. Approximately 11.5 miles (18.6 km) of linear
HPA, totaling 139 acres, were examined, within which 87 new structures are proposed.
The transmission line right of way was examined by LCRA Cultural Resources staff in January, 2017,
using standard survey and subsurface testing methods. The Texas Historical Commission’s minimum
state survey standards for linear surveys were not met due to the paucity of soils, high surface visibility,
and the targeting of specific proposed structure locations to be subjected to subsurface disturbances. Four
new prehistoric sites, 41BP952, 41BP953, 41BP954, and 41LE347, were recorded during the survey. The
portions of sites 41BP952 and 41BP953 within the current right of way do not appear to be eligible for
designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The portions of sites 41BP954 and 41LE347 within
the current right of way are considered of undetermined eligibility and avoidance is recommended.
The cultural resource investigations were conducted under the terms of LCRA’s annual blanket State
Antiquities Permit 7899 in accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and the Memorandum of
Understanding between the Texas Historical Commission and LCRA. There is no known or anticipated
federal funding or permitting involved with this project. No artifacts were collected during the survey; all
field records will be curated at an accredited curational facility.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located in eastern Bastrop, southern Lee, and western Fayette counties, Texas. It spans
the Colorado River floodplain in the southwest, dense dissected hills in the northwestern section, and
gently sloping plains with numerous drainages to the east. Elevations within the project area range
between 310 and 475 ft above mean sea level (amsl). It lies within the Claypan Area of Texas,
representing undulating prairies to gently undulating and rolling topography, which is moderately
dissected (Alvarez 2016:90). Within the Claypan Area, or Post Oak Savannah, hardwoods dominated the
original vegetation, along with a variety of grasses (Alvarez 2016:113).
The southwestern terminus of the transmission line is located on Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits
associated with the old Colorado River floodplain. Such terrace deposits can also be found in the vicinity
of the larger drainages within the project area, Pin Oak Creek and Little Pin Oak Creek. Holocene
alluvium is mapped only in small portions along Little Pin Oak Creek. The surface geology in the upland
areas along the transmission corridor formed within the Eocene Period (Barnes 1974). The western end of
the project area is underlain by Sparta Sand, which consists of a 130- to 150-ft thick bed of very fine to
fine grained quartz sand. The Cook Mountain Formation, composed of clay and sandstone, underlies the
central section of the project area. The geology of the eastern portion of the T-175 transmission line is
represented by the Yegua Formation, which is made up of sandstone, clay, and lignite.
The upland topography is frequently dissected by narrow drainages and swales, the majority of which
hold water only intermittently and seasonally. Among the larger drainages of the area, from west to east,
are the Hunt Branch, Gravelly Creek, Pin Oak Creek, and Little Pin Oak Creek. These water sources all
feed into the Colorado River to the south, which flows on to the Gulf of Mexico.
The T-175 transmission line crosses numerous mapped soil types, and their settings and major
characteristics are detailed below (Table 1) (Soil Survey Staff 2014).With few exceptions, the upland
soils tend toward sands and sandy loams over basal clay. These range from shallow to very deep,
frequently containing pebbles and cobbles of chert.

The T-175 transmission line was originally constructed in 1940, and the 100-ft-wide right of way has
since been modified and cleared of major vegetation. Visible impacts to the project area are
predominantly the result of clearance of land for providing pasturage, as well as the original construction
and ongoing maintenance activities along the transmission line corridor. The majority of the right of way
appears to have been subjected to periodic maintenance, although small portions are overgrown with thick
grasses, mesquite, and various scrub brush. The western margin of the project area parallels the eastern
edge of Buescher State Park. While the park remains forested and presents a view of the natural
vegetation, the vegetation within the project area has been heavily modified. Much of the original
forestation has been cut down in the interest of providing pastureland for grazing. This clearing includes a
man-made feature in the northwestern corner of the transmission line right of way: the name of the
property owner (Luecke), formed in all capital letters by the removal of trees, measuring roughly 0.5 by
2.5 miles. The T-175 transmission line runs from west to east between the C and K (Figure 5).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Bastrop, Fayette, and Lee counties presently have roughly 900, 600, and 300 recorded archaeological
sites, respectively (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas [Atlas]). These can safely be described as
encompassing all presently recognized cultural periods within the state. Nine cultural resources projects
have been conducted within 0.6 miles (1 km) of the current project area.
Constructed in 1940, the T-175 transmission line has never been subjected to formal archaeological
survey; however, a section of the current project’s western right of way has been examined previously. In
2005, LCRA archaeologists conducted work for the proposed M.D. Anderson Waste Water Pipeline,
which extends east from within Buescher State Park to the T-175 transmission line corridor, and then
south for approximately 2,300 m toward Smithville (Hixson and Skeete 2006). Due to reported “extreme
surface disturbances,” the project area within the T-175 transmission line corridor was not surveyed
(Hixson and Skeete 2005). No cultural resources sites were identified during this survey.
Several small projects have been performed within the vicinity of the current project area. At the
southwestern end of the line, a 1986 project for the Historic Preservation Fund was conducted northeast
of Smithville (Atlas). The Smithville Municipal Airport was surveyed in 1996 (Atlas). Neither project
located cultural resource sites.
In 1990, Espey, Huston & Associates surveyed a transmission line rebuild for LCRA from the Winchester
substation to the Salem substation (Rogers 1990). This effort evaluated three previously recorded sites
and documented 11 new sites. Only one of these, 41FY496, is located within 1 km of the current project
area. The site was a sparse lithic scatter consisting of three chert flakes and a chert biface, and was
determined ineligible for SAL designation (Atlas).
Espey, Huston & Associates also performed archaeological investigations in 1996-1997 for LCRA’s T150 transmission line, from Sim Gideon-Smithville (Nash 1996, Galan 1997). These efforts revisited 4
previously identified sites and recorded 5 additional sites. Only site 41BP478, a prehistoric site, is located
within 1 km of the current line. Originally determined eligible, the site was designated ineligible in 2005
(Atlas); no corresponding project is listed in the Atlas.
Buescher State Park abuts the current T-175 project area along the entirety of its western extent.
Numerous small projects have been conducted within the park’s confines for the construction of trails and
fire breaks (Hicks et al. 2011, Haefner et al. 2012, Mahoney 2015, Barnes 2016). These have identified
several cultural resources sites, of which only site 41BP911 lies within 1 km of the present project area.
The site is described as a shallow, ephemeral lithic scatter within broad uplands; it has been determined
ineligible for SAL designation (Haefner et al. 2012).
At the eastern terminus of the current project area, LCRA’s T-186 transmission between Winchester and
Plum was surveyed in 2004 (Hixson et al. 2006) and again in 2008 (Malof 2009). The former survey
identified three new prehistoric sites, and the latter recorded one new historic site. None were within 1 km
of the current project area.

No sites were previously identified within proposed T-175 project area. Table 2 summarizes known
archaeological sites within 1 km of the project area. All are of prehistoric age, and appear to represent
lithic procurement areas and/or open-air campsites.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

Prehistoric Background
The project area is considered to be in the easternmost margin of the central Texas archaeological region
(Pertulla 2013:7). Central Texas prehistory has typically been divided into four main subdivisions, known
variably as eras or periods, which are subdivided further into phases or subperiods. These subdivisions
combine to begin to describe 11,500 years of history. A longstanding chronology of Prewitt (1981, 1985)
has been revised by Johnson and Goode (1994), who utilized new lines of evidence based on climatic and
geomorphological data to redefine period divisions. This can be contrasted with Collins (1995), who
indicates climatic variables at times were somewhat different than those of Johnson and Goode. A more
detailed prehistoric cultural context will be included in the final version of this report.
Historic Background
European exploration within the vicinity of the project area began in the late seventeenth and early
eighteenth centuries A.D. Spanish explorers established two major routes: the Old San Antonio Road to
the west in Bastrop (Marks 2017), and La Bahia Road to the east, in LaGrange. Anglo settlement within
the region began in earnest during the early nineteenth century, when Stephen F. Austin obtained a land
grant from the government of Mexico. A fuller account of the historic period within this portion of Texas
can be found in LCRA’s annual report for 2017.

METHODOLOGY

The project was designed to identify and assess archaeological sites that might be eligible for formal
listing as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL). All work was conducted under blanket TAC Permit 7899
and terms of the memorandum of understanding between THC and LCRA, which incorporates CTA
survey and reporting standards.
Following a review of geology, soils, recent and historical maps, and previous investigations, HPAs were
identified for potential prehistoric and historic sites. Prehistoric HPAs were based on proximity to natural
water resources and topography, and historic HPAs were based on aerial photographs and historic map
research. HPAs were expanded or contracted during the survey at the discretion of the principal
investigator. The majority was covered by pedestrian survey, with subsurface testing conducted at the
proposed tower locations within those areas; other areas with depleted soils, steep slopes, or surface
disturbance were examined during transit.
Shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm levels to subsoil or a depth of 100 cm, whichever was reached first.
Soils were screened through 0.25-inch mesh unless dominated by clay, in which case they were sorted by
hand. Artifacts were recorded, but were not collected. Instead, artifacts were reinterred within the shovel
test following completion.

RESULTS
Approximately 11.5 miles (118.6 km), totaling 139 acres, of the T-175 transmission line possessing a
high probability for encountering cultural resources sites were surveyed by LCRA archaeologists over six
days in January. A total of 45 shovel tests was excavated, of which 8 were positive for cultural materials.
Four new cultural resources sites—41BP952, 41BP953, 41BP954, and 41LE347—were recorded.

41BP952
Setting and Description
Immediately west of a feeder to Pin Oak Creek, site 41BP952 represents a prehistoric open campsite and
likely lithic procurement area. The site occupies the gentle eastern slope of a low interfluve at an
elevation of approximately 360 ft amsl (Figure 6). The soils in the area are mapped as belonging to the
Crockett series of fine sandy loam, eroded (Soil Survey Staff 2014). Two additional transmission lines
and cleared corridors parallel the current T-175 to the north. Within this enlarged right of way, short
grasses predominate, with patches of longer grass present (Figure 7). Ground surface visibility at the time
of survey ranged from 30 to 90 percent, the latter due to gopher bioturbation. Across the creek to east,
surface gravels of chert and quartz are present on the surface eroding out of the shallow soils.

Figure 6. Sketch map of site 41BP952.

Figure 7. Overview of site 41BP952, facing west/northwest.

Work Performed
Surface observation revealed a thin scatter of lithic debitage and fire-cracked rock across the site over a
distance of approximately 110 m east-west. A shovel test placed in the vicinity of the proposed tower
location proved positive for artifacts. Three additional shovel tests were excavated to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site, with two yielding additional cultural materials; these confirmed
the western boundary of the site as evidenced by its surface manifestation. Surface materials are present
across the 30-m width of the project right of way and appear to extend beyond those limits to the north
and south.
Artifact Analysis
Artifacts observed on the surface included two primary flakes, two secondary flakes, and four tertiary
flakes. Fifteen pieces of burned chert and quartz (up to 5 cm in length) were also present across the site
surface.
Shovel tests 25, 26, and 27 yielded two tertiary flake fragments, a piece of fire-cracked rock (5 cm in
length), and a tertiary flake and piece of burned rock, respectively. All artifacts within shovel tests were
found within level 1, 0 to 20 cm below surface (cmbs).
Conclusions and Recommendation
Site 41BP952 is a low density surface and subsurface concentration of lithic debitage and small firecracked fragments, which extends beyond the current project’s right of way boundaries. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts, associated features, or intact buried deposits were observed. For these reasons, the
portion of site 41BP952 within the T-175 right of way appears to be SAL-ineligible. LCRA does not
recommend avoidance or additional cultural resources work.

41BP953
Setting and Description
Prehistoric site 41BP953 occupies a low toeslope within a bend of Pin Oak Creek at an approximate
elevation of 360 ft amsl (Figure 8). The Crockett series of fine sandy loam, eroded, is mapped as the
major soil type across the project area (Soil Survey Staff 2014). A second LCRA transmission line and
corridor is located to the north of the current project area, and another line parallels that even farther to
the north, resulting in a very wide combined right of way cleared of major vegetation. Dense low to
medium grasses limited ground surface visibility to less than 10 percent (Figure 9).

Figure 8. Sketch map of site 41BP953.

Figure 9. Overview of site 41BP953, facing west/northwest.

Work Performed
A shovel test at the proposed tower location produced cultural materials between 20 and 60 cmbs within
sand that bottomed out in sandy clay at a depth of 70 cmbs. Four additional shovel tests were placed to
determine the site’s horizontal limits; these ranged between 30 and 60 cmbs, and none yielded evidence
of cultural materials. Based on the results of shovel testing, the natural limits of the landform, and the
southern right of way boundary, the site is estimated as having a diameter of 25 m; it is unknown whether
the site extends beyond the project right of way. The density of ground cover prevented the observation of
any surface artifacts.
Artifact Analysis
The single positive shovel test contained three pieces of chert debitage in level 2, 20-40 cmbs, and one
piece of burned chert in level 3, 40-60 cmbs. The chert consisted of one primary flake and two tertiary
flakes and fragments, all of distinct material.
Conclusions and Recommendation
Site 41BP953 seems to represent a short-term prehistoric open campsite of indeterminate age and cultural
association. Due to the paucity of cultural materials, lack of features and diagnostic objects, and relatively
shallow soils, the portion of site 41BP953 within the project right of way is recommended ineligible for
designation as an SAL. No additional work or avoidance is deemed necessary.

41BP954
Setting and Description
Prehistoric site 41BP954 is located on a low upland rise between two intermittent drainages (Figure 10).
At an elevation of approximately 420 ft amsl, it overlooks several channels that merge to form a larger
feeder into JD Creek, 2 km to the southeast. The Padina series of fine sands predominates at the site (Soil
Survey Staff 2014); heavy erosion along the steeper portions of the slope has removed most of the upper
sandy horizons to expose the rocky sandy clay loam beneath. The site area lies within right of way that
has been completely cleared of all vegetation but low grasses (Figure 11). The fence line to the west
marks the boundary of Buescher State Park, where young pines predominate. Gopher holes are plentiful
and provide evidence for heavy disturbance from bioturbation. The site has also been impacted by the
previously surveyed wastewater line (Hixson and Skeete 2006), and a possibly related modern water
pump station lies outside the right of way to the east.

Figure 10. Sketch map of site 41BP954.

Figure 11. Overview of site 41BP954, facing north/northeast.

Work Performed
Although no structures are proposed for this landform, the site’s surface manifestation prompted further
investigation. The surface scatter has been exposed primarily due to bioturbation from rodents. The
highest density of artifacts is limited to the landform between two drainages; but small numbers of flakes
were observed on the eroded slopes to the immediate north and south. The site is bounded to west and
east by the existing 30-m-wide transmission line right of way. Based on the size of the landform and
extent of the majority of surface artifacts, the site measures approximately 110 m north-south. Two shovel
tests were placed across the landform to determine the depth and intensity of deposits; both contained
cultural materials.
Artifact Analysis
Surface materials were observed primarily within gopher mounds in a density of roughly two to three per
1 m2. Lithic artifacts included one heavily reworked dart point, two thinned bifaces, two multidirectional
chert cores and close to 100 pieces of chert debitage (Figure 12). Of the production debris, approximately
5 percent were of the primary, 25 percent were of secondary, and 70 percent were of tertiary stage of
manufacture. Burned chert and quartz pebbles and cobbles were ubiquitous across the site surface; it is
highly probable that some of these fire-cracked rocks are a result of post-deposition burning rather than
cultural usage.

Figure 12. Lithic artifacts from site 41BP954.

The two shovel tests produced large amounts of lithic artifacts to depths of 100 cm and beyond
(unrecoverable due to depth). Shovel Test 36 contained a thinned biface, a core fragment, 58 flakes and
flake fragments, 33 chert chips, numerous small pieces of burned chert and heat spalls, and 29 larger firecracked chert (up to 8 cm in diameter). Almost all of the debitage was of the tertiary stage of manufacture
and spread fairly evenly throughout the test. The majority of fire-cracked rock was concentrated between

60 and 100 cm, weighing a combined total of almost 6 kg. The test was terminated in dense unworked
gravels and cobbles. Shovel test 37 followed the same pattern, with 83 flakes, flake fragments, and chips,
numerous heat spalls, and 32 pieces of larger fire-cracked rock. No evidence of culturally distinct layers
was present.
Conclusions and Recommendation
The amount of lithic material and burned rock suggest that site 41BP954 represents the remains of an
open air encampment. Although the high degree of bioturbation at the site precludes the determination of
prehistoric components, the presence of a heavily worked dart point indicates at least one occupation
likely occurred during the Archaic period. Despite the degree of disturbance at the site, its deposits may
still hold further information that could contribute to the knowledge of Texas prehistory. Without further
investigation, the portion of site 41BP954 within the current project area should be considered of
undetermined SAL eligibility. Heavy machinery and construction should be limited to the existing twotrack road and avoid the undisturbed portions of the site within the right of way.
41LE347
Setting and Description
Site 41LE347 is a newly recorded prehistoric site situated on a low rise within a bend of Little Pin Oak
Creek, spanning an elevation of roughly 330 to 340 ft amsl (Figure 13). The site is bounded by the creek
to the north and east, and the edges are sloped and heavily eroded, with gravels exposed on the surface.
The soils across the site are mapped as Tabor fine sandy loam, which typically consists of 36 cm of fine
sandy loam above a clay B-horizon (Soil Survey Staff 2014); however, shovel testing encountered fine
sands to a depth of approximately 100 cmbs. Vegetation consisted of low grasses within the existing
transmission line right of way, and oaks, junipers, and other mixed hardwoods along the banks of the
creek (Figure 14). Ground surface visibility varied widely, ranging from very low due to the grass cover
to high on eroded surfaces.

Figure 13. Sketch map of site 41LE347.

Figure 14. Overview of site 41LE347, facing west.

Work Performed
The site was initially identified by shovel testing, which was offset approximately 7 m from the original
proposed tower structure due to slope and surface disturbance. A second shovel test was placed roughly
60 m to the west on the only other relatively level surface within the corridor. Tests yielded cultural
materials to depths between 100 cm and 110 cmbs. Examination of the eroded slopes yielded a couple of
chert artifacts within the project right of way; additional chert flakes were observable to the south.
The site is naturally bounded to the west, north, and east by the edges of the landform. While the site
appears to extend to the south, determination of its southern margin was limited to the extent of the
LCRA right of way. Based on these factors, the site measures roughly 140 m east-west by 35 m northsouth.
Artifact Analysis
The vast majority of cultural materials observed at the site were found within the two shovel tests. Shovel
Test 13 produced a total of 24 chert flakes and chips of all stages of manufacture from surface to 100
cmbs, as well as a fragmentary thinned biface between 60 and 80 cmbs. Close to 50 small pieces of
burned chert and heat spalls were scattered throughout, though the largest number of these and the lithic
debitage were within the test’s upper 60 cm. Fifteen larger pieces of fire-cracked rock were present
between 60 and 80 cmbs; these averaged 13 cm in diameter and weighed a total of 1.75 kilograms (kg).
Shovel Test 14 yielded similar results, though in much smaller numbers. Six chert flakes and fragments,
18 burned chert chips and heat spalls, and 26 pieces of fire-cracked rock (2-5 cm in diameter) were spread
relatively evenly throughout the test from 0 to 110 cmbs, although the larger fire-cracked rocks were in
higher numbers within the bottom 40 cm.
The sparse surface assemblage comprised a thinned biface and a single chert flake. These were observed
in the few areas without soil and vegetation. No associated features were identified.
Conclusions and Recommendation
Site 41LE347 likely represents an open-air campsite, which took advantage of the proximity of the creek
and the availability of workable chert. The high amounts of lithic debitage provide evidence for the
reduction of raw materials and the production of tools, while cooking and/or heat treatment of chert is by
the presence of fire-cracked rock. Although higher densities of burned rock occurred at lower levels
within the shovel tests, there was no firm evidence of intact features or stratigraphic integrity of artifacts.
Despite the lack of diagnostic materials, faunal or floral data, and the presence of artifacts within sandy
soils, the depth of deposits and density of artifacts suggest site 41LE347 may still be able to provide
additional information. For this reason, LCRA recommends that the portion of the site within the current
right of way be of undetermined eligibility for SAL designation and that the site be avoided by
construction of the proposed T-175 transmission line. In consideration of these concerns, LCRA
engineers have agreed to move the location of the proposed structure to the deflated slope on the site’s
eastern boundary.

SUMMARY

LCRA Cultural Resources staff conducted an intensive cultural resources assessment of 11.5 linear miles
(18.6 km) of HPA in preparation for the proposed upgrade of transmission line T-175. The project
operated within a 100-ft-wide right of way and covered an area of 139 acres. The assessment located and
recorded four previously undocumented cultural resource sites. Prehistoric sites 41BP952 and 41BP953
consist of light lithic scatters on the surface or in shallow contexts. While both sites may continue beyond
the present right of way boundaries, their portions within the right of way are considered ineligible for
SAL designation due to the paucity of material, lack of diagnostic artifacts and features, and shallow soil
depth. Prehistoric sites 41BP954 and 41LE347 both harbor high densities of cultural material within deep
soil deposits. Based on the results of the survey, both sites are considered of undetermined eligibility for
designation as SALS. It is recommended that the portions of these sites within the right of way be avoided
by construction and that travel be limited to the well-traveled two-track maintenance road.
LCRA Cultural Resources staff considers the rebuild of the T-175 transmission line to be fully
investigated. Because no SAL-eligible sites are to be impacted by construction activities, LCRA
recommends that all currently proposed work be allowed to proceed without restrictions. Standard
emergency discovery procedures will be in place, and should any previously undiscovered cultural
resources be discovered in the course of the rebuild, work in the immediate vicinity of the discovery will
cease, and LCRA Cultural Resources staff will be contacted to determine what, if any, mitigation efforts
are necessary.
