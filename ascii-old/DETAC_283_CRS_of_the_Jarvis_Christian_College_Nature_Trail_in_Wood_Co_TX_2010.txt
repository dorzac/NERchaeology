ABSTRACT

In December 2008 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resource management survey of the Jarvis Christian College nature
trail in Wood County, Texas under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
The trail right-of-way totaled 2.9 km (1.8 miles) long and 1.2 m (4 feet) wide. Shovel
testing and visual examination could not find any evidence of cultural resources. Much
of the proposed trail will be in a marsh or on adjacent slopes and upland ridges which
have been impacted by modern development. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the
determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed nature trail. If
any artifacts are encountered during the excavation of the trench, then all excavation
should stop and a qualified archaeologist should be contacted to investigate the site
before continuing with the proposed work.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2008, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants)
conducted a cultural resources survey of the proposed Jarvis Christian College Nature
Trail, in Wood County, Texas (Figure 1). The trail will be on the college campus
approximately 2.5 kilometers (1.6 miles) east of Hawkins Tx. The survey was conducted
at the request of the college in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act as funding for the trail was provide by the Federal Government and
managed by Texas Parks and Wildlife. The report was reviewed by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC).
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. The report was prepared following the short
report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a) with
modifications requested by the THC (Martin 1999). No cultural resources were found
during the survey. Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no
effect” to cultural resources for the proposed nature trail.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project includes a 2.9 km (1.8 mile) long trail through wetland and adjacent
uplands along Rogers Creek. The project plans include clearing and leveling an area 1.2
meter (4 ft) wide and up to 30 cm (12 inches) deep then coving the stripped area with
gravel to construct the trail. The trail was delineated by existing trails and roads along
with a cleared path in previously undisturbed areas. Vegetation ranged from stands of
pine trees and mixed hardwood trees with moderate understory to grasses, bushes, and
shrubs.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Wood County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both
larger examinations and numerous small surveys. Recently, the larger investigations
focused on the Lake Fork, e.g., Bruseth et al. (1977) and Lake Bob Sandlin e.g., Sullivan
1976. While smaller surveys conducted in Wood County include Price (1997) survey of
the Mineola waste water treatment plant expansion in Wood County and Moore’s (2003)
survey water system improvements for Fouke Water Supply Corp. These investigations
found, tested, and conducted data recovery efforts on a variety of historic and prehistoric
sites. Most of the surveys mentioned above focused on low lands and areas adjacent to
perennial streams and well developed floodplains. The numerous small surveys in the
area are primarily for county utility services, FMHA and TX DOT surveys.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The
documents of primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990)
discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission,
Department of Antiquities Protection developed a document for the eastern Texas portion
of the Texas State Plan (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This document includes several
historic contexts, each of which deals with a particular facet of northeast Texas
prehistory. This plan serves to synthesize the current state of archaeological research in
the region and identify problems and objectives to be addressed in future research and
cultural resources management. Several weak areas in archaeological knowledge of the
region are identified in these studies. Cultural chronology, aboriginal settlement patterns
and subsistence, and historic continuities are some of the general research directions that
these recent studies emphasize as important for developing future archaeological research
designs. Today the area remains largely agricultural and produces crops including cotton,
corn, hay and vegetables. Beef and dairy cattle, as well as hogs are also raised. The coal
timber and oil industry currently play a prominent role in the areas commercial
enterprises. (THA 2008).
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200
B.C. - A.D. 800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the

3

historic Euro American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian
period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and
gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic
(7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200
B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing
utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens,
prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle,
and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of
northeast Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture
(A.D. 800-1600). This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323).

Larger

aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial
areas. Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds. A stratified
social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by
Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also established. The Late
Prehistoric period ended with the slow decimation of the Indian populations and the
influx of the Spanish occupation. Extensive commercial networks were also established.
The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the current cultural
setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations domination of the
area, to the American immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and counties. Today,
the area remains largely agricultural and produces crops including cotton, corn, hay and
vegetables. Beef and dairy cattle, as well as hogs, are also raised. The timber and oil
industries currently play a prominent role in the area’s commercial enterprises (THA
2008).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231,
1970); the Archaeological Protection Act of 1979 (PL96-95; 16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm); and
the guidelines set forth by the CTA (1995b), the Texas Antiquities Code, and the Register
of Professional Archaeologists.
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National
Park Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) for determining eligibility of a cultural resource
to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to
locate prehistoric and historic cultural resources sites within the survey areas. If sites
were found, then the investigations were to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of
each site, determine each site’s integrity, and provide a preliminary evaluation of each
site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using maps and files at the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2008). The site
location maps and cultural resources records at TARL were consulted to identify the
location, types, and both State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of
previously recorded sites within or in close proximity to the project area. The Site Atlas
was consulted for published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.
DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites,
the pedestrian survey relied on visual examination and shovel testing.

Visual

examinations were conducted in areas with exposed soil surfaces in a continuous effort
between shovel tests at all locations with exposed surfaces. Shovel testing was conducted
in accordance with the Texas Historic Commission’s guidelines for cultural resources
surveys. According to these guidelines, linear project areas require a minimum of 16
shovel tests per mile; therefore, a total of 29 shovel tests were required for the 2.9 km
(1.8 mile) trail. Shovel testing included excavating an area approximately 30 cm (12
inches) in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35
inches). The excavated matrix was screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh
screen. The depth, soil type, and color of each shovel test were recorded.

RESULTS
The closest documented cultural resources survey was the survey of farm to
market roads conducted by the FHWA in 1988 approximately 2.6 km (1.6 miles)
southwest of the proposed trail and the survey by the Bureau of Reclamation for the Big
Sandy Creek Reservoir (Perttula 1986) roughly 3 km (1.9 miles) to the north east of the
proposed trail.

No sites were documented during the road survey, but the Big Sandy

Project survey was successful in documenting several sites of which 41WD435 was the
closest to the current project area. The closest archaeological site was 41WD638, a
prehistoric lithic scatter recorded along an undocumented survey (Tiemann 2004) for a
pipeline 1.7 km (1 mile) south of the proposed trail.
Topography across the proposed trail crosses a lowland marsh along Rogers
Creek and the adjacent upland slopes and ridges on the west and south sides of the marsh.
Soils were described as Manco loam (flood plains) (NRCS 2008) with 10 cm (4 inches)
of loam over clay loam, Gallime fine sandy loam (stream terraces) 0-86cm (34 inches)
fine sandy loam over clay loam and Cuthbert fine sandy loam (ridge slopes and summits)
0-18cm (7 inches) fine sandy loam over clay. The topography and soils information
suggested the nature trail had a low probability for containing cultural resources and the
saturated soil has a low potential for containing intact cultural features.
The pedestrian survey of the trail location found that the area was forested with
mature pine trees and dense under story separated by areas where tall grasses and weeds
prevailed. Modern features include two well locations and associated access roads which
will be utilized by the proposed trail route. Upland and slope areas were disturbed by
construction of buildings and adjacent grounds for the college leaving some areas with
exposed Bt horizons and little grass covering. Shovel testing therefore focused on the
relatively undisturbed portions of the trail that were not under water, e.g., toe slopes,
benches, and elevated areas in the marsh. In general, soil conditions similar to the soil
survey with sandy loamy soils; however, the depths varied with shallower soils on the
slopes and deeper tests in select micro topography near Rogers creek. Redox soils and
clay were observed along the trail as well as heavily eroded areas along the southern end
of the trail near the slope closest to the Jarvis College Presidents house. A total of 23

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed Jarvis Christian College Nature Trail project area, will impact the
slope and wetland area near Rogers Creek. Topography and soil conditions suggest the
area of the flood plain has a low probability for containing cultural resources while the
adjacent uplands was a higher probability area; however, modern development has
reduced the soils to the B horizon. Well pads and logging may also have destroyed any
existing cultural resources along the trail area.

Surface inspection and shovel testing did

not reveal any evidence of past prehistoric occupation.
In conclusion, the investigations did not document any cultural resources. Based
on the investigations, there is little chance of encountering cultural resources in the
project areas. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect”
on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed nature trail.
