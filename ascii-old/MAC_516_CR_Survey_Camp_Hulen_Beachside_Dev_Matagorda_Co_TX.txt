ABSTRACT
On October 23, and November 1-2, 2007, and May 15, 16, and 22-28, 2008, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural resource survey investigation for the
approximately 450 acre proposed Phase I and II portions of the Camp Hulen property (41MG129)
in Matagorda County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding any identified resources. The investigations were
conducted for Crouch Environmental Services, Inc. under Texas Historical Commission Section
106 guidelines, in anticipation of the submission of a permit application to the U.S. Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District. The total 450 acre area will be included in the permit application
submitted to the U.S. Corps of Engineers, Galveston District.
An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted in two stages, and included
both surface and subsurface (shovel test, backhoe trench/area stripping) examination. During the
initial stage of investigations in 2007, a visual assessment of the entire property was conducted,
and a total of 45 shovel tests were excavated along the property shoreline. During the second
stage of investigations, which took place in 2008 and focused on the Camp Hulen military base
area, a total of approximately 2500 square meters was mechanically stripped during the sampling
of eight potential activity areas.
The general survey determined that there are three standing structures still present within the
project area: two incinerators and one small water pump house. Each of the three structures has
suffered the initial stages of demolition, with the windows and door treatments removed, and
some interior walls partially collapsed or demolished. Neither the two incinerator structures nor
the pump house are sufficiently intact or exhibit qualities that render them inherently significant
enough to be eligible for the National Register. An intensive pedestrian field survey of the
current project area was conducted of the narrow corridor (up to ca. 30 m in width) between the
highly disturbed area of the historic Camp Hulen grounds and the outermost edge of the project
APE. A total of 45 shovel tests were excavated, but no evidence of archeological or historic
remains or features was identified. During the second stage of investigations, which took place in
2008, a total of approximately 2500 square meters was mechanically stripped during the sampling
of eight potential activity areas. These investigations documented the extensive nature of the
destruction and demolition of buildings and standing camp facilities, with the majority of remains
limited to concrete foundation piers and sewer/water lines. While the presence of sections of
shell walkways, overlain by disturbed soil and demolition debris, and underlain by undisturbed
natural soils, indicate that the occupational surface of the camp is preserved in a few places, the
majority of the investigated areas appear to have experienced significant disturbance and some
truncation during the demolition of the majority of the camp’s standing structures.
The sum of this evidence leads to the conclusion that the archeological component of Camp
Hulen within the Beachside project is not eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places. Consequently, no further archeological investigations are recommended. In
order to expedite the construction of the interior canal system, an interim report detailing the
results of the mechanical sampling investigations was submitted to the THC and USACE on May
30, 2008, and concurrence with its findings was obtained on June 19, 2008. The artifacts and
historical records collected for this project will, in keeping with the wishes of the Landowner and
the concurrence of THC, be donated to the Palacios Area Historical Association for use in its area
historical educational programming. In the event that archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
camp-related construction and activities, as
well as more recent demolition efforts. The
property is slated for extensive residential
development, and will include the
construction of coastal jetties, and an inland
marina and system of canals. The large
wetland areas located along the western and
southern shorelines are to be preserved and
avoided by development (i.e., outside the
Area of Potential Effects [APE]).

On October 23, and November 1-2,
2007, and May 15, 16, and 22-28, 2008,
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation for the proposed Beachside
project on the Camp Hulen property
(41MG129) in Matagorda County, Texas.
The objectives of the investigation were to
locate and identify cultural materials, sites,
or historic properties within the proposed
permit area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0784, 08-35, 08-36) were conducted for
Crouch Environmental Services, Inc. under
Texas Historical Commission Section 106
guidelines, in anticipation of the submission
of a permit application to the U.S. Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the current project area was conducted in
two stages, and included both surface and
subsurface (shovel test, backhoe trench)
examination (Figure 2). During the initial
stage of investigations in 2007, a visual
assessment of the entire property was
conducted, and a total of 45 shovel tests
(STs 1-43) were excavated along the
property shoreline. During the second stage
of investigations, which took place in 2008,
a total of approximately 2500 square meters
was mechanically stripped during the
sampling of eight potential activity areas.

Persuant to Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act, the
permit area is the 450-acre proposed project
site. The Area of Potential Effect (APE)
includes the permit area and the shorelines
of Tres Palacios Bay and Turtle Bays.
Figure 1 depicts these areas on a 7.5' USGS
topographic quadrangle map (Turtle Bay
and Palacios, Texas, quadrangles).

The field investigations were
conducted by project archeologists Randy
Ferguson and Jennie Kelly, and field
technicians Chris Reber, Lisa Rodriguez,
and Brian Vagi. Roger G. Moore served as
the project’s principal investigator.

The APE includes approximately
1.4 miles (ca. 2.3 km) of shoreline and
saltmarsh, as well as inland areas comprised
of low, flat uplands. Much of the inland
zone has been heavily disturbed by historic

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Hydrology
The project area is a point of coastal
lands bounded on the southeast by Tres
Palacios Bay and on the west by Turtle Bay.
No freshwater surface streams are located
within the project area.

Soils and Geology
Matagorda County is located within
the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Flora and Fauna
Matagorda County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

The project area is located on sheet
57 of the Soil Survey of Matagorda County,
Texas (Hyde 2001). Soil types present in
the project area include Palacios loam, 0 to 1
percent slopes (PaA) across the majority of
the interior of the project area, and Harris
clay, frequently flooded (Ha) along the
shorelines. Palacios loam is described as
poorly drained with very slow surface runoff
(Hyde 2001:46). Harris clay is described as
a very poorly drained soil with very slow
surface runoff (Hyde 2001:37).

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail

Climate
The modern climate of the
Matagorda County study area is dominated
by the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and hot and humid summers (Hyde
2001:11). Summer temperatures average
82°F (28°C), while winter temperatures
average 54°F (12°C). Annual precipitation
averages 48 inches (122 cm).

(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)
may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the area began
in the early 16th century with the ill-fated
Narváez expedition that, in 1528, deposited
Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas coastline,
possibly on Galveston Island. More longterm contacts resulting from permanent
European settlement did not directly impact
aboriginal lifeways in southeast Texas until
the early 18th century (Patterson 1995).
However, European diseases introduced by
explorers and early traders had begun to
affect Native American populations in Texas
by the 16th century (Ewers 1974).
Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, epidemic diseases, the mission
system, and the fur trade seriously reduced,
and in some cases exterminated, the
indigenous populations residing in the
region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

Camp Hulen
The project property is located just
west of the community of Palacios, and
served as the location of Camp Hulen, a
military base from 1926 until 1946 (Jenkins
1996). The camp was established as Camp
Palacios in 1926 for summer training of the
36th Infantry Division of the Texas National
Guard. In 1930, it was renamed Camp
Hulen in honor of John Augustus Hulen, a
highly decorated officer of the Philippine
Insurrection and of World War I, and the
acting commanding General of the division
from 1922 to 1935 (Skaggs 1996). By 1940,
the 36th Infantry Division had relocated to

photos, though they depicted many
structures and tent rows. We were more
successful at identifying the "pre-WW II
activity areas” of the camp, most of which
was within the 450-acre beachside tract.
This information was derived from an
undated, but clearly pre-World War II map
annotated by Mr. Guy Claybourn (Figure
27). We also identified the location of the
very large World War II complex of hospital
buildings and the small arms firing range.

Camp Bowie (Jenkins 1996:939), and the
base became a center for anti-aircraft
gunnery training for the 211th Coastal
Artillery Regiment (Antiaircraft). At the
camp’s height during World War II, it
housed a maximum of 14,560 troops, and
consisted of “some 400 semi-permanent
buildings and 2,825 floored (concrete),
framed, and screened tents, as well as a tent
theater, fire station, bakery, weather station,
library, dental clinic, post office, and 500bed hospital” (Figures 3-8, from the Texas
Military Forces Museum webpage). Though
an airstrip had been established at the north
end of the camp in the early 1930s, it was
found to be unsuitable for the sustained
target towing operations needed for antiaircraft gunnery practice (Freeman 2006).
Consequently, by mid-1943, a new airfield
had been constructed a short distance to the
north, across Highway 35. This airfield
remains in operation as the Palacios
Municipal Airport.
The old airstrip
probably saw occasional use by light liaison
aircraft until 1946, and is still visible on
aerial photographs.

These additional resources provided
insight into a number of activities and
material resources that were associated with
the historic military camp. A notation by
Mr. Claybourn on an aerial photograph
dated to 1939 shows two aircraft sitting on
the original, adjacent airstrip. The planes
are identified as North American O-47Bs.
The two-seater, propeller-driven aircraft had
originally been developed to replace the
obsolete O-19 and O-38 observation
biplanes (Swanborough and Bowers 1964).
The planes were quite large, having a crew
of three (pilot, observer, rear gunner), and a
distinctive bulge in the belly of the fuselage.
This bulge was equipped with several glass
windows, and enabled the observer to see
downward without their view being
obscured by the low-set wings. Of the 174
O-47s ordered by the Air Corps in 19371938, approximately half were assigned to
National Guard units. By 1941, the aircraft
was determined to be a poor fit for its
designed role, with lighter airplanes “more
capable of operating with ground troops,”
and fighters and twin-engine bombers
showing “greater ability to perform recon
and photo duties” (Swanborough and
Bowers 1964).
However, the pictured
aircraft may have stayed on at Camp Hulen
with its shift to anti-aircraft gunnery
training, as after 1941, O-47s were
“relegated to such duties as towing targets,
coastal patrol, and anti-submarine patrol”
(Swanborough and Bowers 1964).

By 1944 the camp was converted to
house German prisoners of war (Jenkins
1996). Many of these prisoners were hired
out as farm labor to help mitigate local
manpower shortages due to the war effort.
At war’s end, the camp was returned to the
Texas
National
Guard,
who
decommissioned it in 1946 and began to
dismantle it for scrap. Though the property
was purchased in 1965 for an industrial
park, the planned development was never
completed.
In addition to this basic history of
the camp, further documentary investigation
and interviews with local historical interests
(Ms. Colleen Clayburn, the Trull
Foundation, and the Palacios Area Historical
Association) were conducted on May 19,
2008. A series of oblique aerial photographs
of the Camp dating from 1927 to 1945 were
copied during this visit.

structures (which were extremely numerous
by 1945) were rarely labeled on these

mechanism. However, the presence of
limited numbers of these new guns meant
the M3 continued to serve in a number of
theatres throughout the early stages of the
war. Eventually, many of these 3-nch guns
were reconfigured with a new twin-railed
carriage, optics, and protective shield,
transforming them into the effective M5
anti-tank gun.

as 3-inch anti-aircraft guns. These appear to
be the M3 3-inch gun, which had become
the standard U.S. anti-aircraft weapon by
around 1930 (Brooks 2008). The M3 fired a
3 inch diameter (76.2 mm) explosive
projectile, and had a maximum horizontal
range of 10,500 yards, and a maximum
effective altitude of 25,000 ft. The gun had
a muzzle velocity of 2,700 ft/second, and a
maximum rate of fire of 25 rounds per
minute. Mobile M3 guns were towed
artillery, which required training for quick
limbering and set-up. Each gun was manned
by a gun section composed of 21 soldiers
divided into two squads: the gun squad and
ammunition squad. They were organized
into batteries containing four guns, their
crews and transport vehicles.

The
interviews,
and
the
documentary and photographic analyses
resulted in the identification of numerous
camp components of historical and
archeological interest associated with the
Camp Hulen and its predecessors. As a
consequence, we were able to select eight
subsurface survey investigation areas which
were to be sampled in order to document the
degree of intactness of potential deposits, as
well as attempt to confirm or deny the
functions and/or activities associated with
the different areas.

By the late 1930s, it was recognized
that the new generation of faster, higherflying combat aircraft would render the 3inch gun obsolete, and by the spring of
1940, it had begun to be replaced by a more
powerful 90 mm antiaircraft artillery piece

site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological

literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search indicated
that the property was part of the Camp
Hulen military site (41MG129), but that no
other previously identified archeological
sites, historic properties, or State landmarks
were present within the project APE. Site
41MG129 has not been designated as an
SAL or National Register property. While
there are several Texas State historical
markers that commemorate the Camp Hulen

The
earliest
known
written
investigations of the Matagorda Bay area
took place in the 1930s, in the form of
investigations on Indianola in Calhoun
County and the Battle Island site (41MG1)
in Matagorda County (Fritz 1974). In 1941,
a field archeologist from the University of
Texas at Austin, G. E. Arnold, conducted
archeological reconnaissance surveys along
the Texas coast. In Matagorda County, he
recorded an occupation campsite and three
shell middens.
Other
investigations
of
the
Matagorda Bay area include work done in
1965 by Dee Ann Story and Dorris Olds
between the Lavaca and Navidad Rivers. In
the Story survey, seven sites were plotted:

three Native American sites and four 19th
century Anglo-American occupations (Fritz
1974). In 1967, five more sites were
recorded in Matagorda Bay near the Lavaca
River. Investigations in 1971 include an
investigation for the Texas Highway
Department, in which amateur archeologist
Cecil Calhoun recorded 70 sites, many of
which are now destroyed (Fritz 1974).

sites were recorded during the survey (Fritz
1974).
Moore Archeological Consulting,
Inc., has conducted numerous surveys along
the Texas Coast, including the area of
Matagorda Bay. In 1996, an archeological
reconnaissance was undertaken in the Mad
Island Wildlife Management area, which
resulted the identification of 18 new sites
(41MG87-41MG104; Hubbard et al. 1996).
Of these sites, one was a historic windmill
and cistern, 14 consisted of prehistoric
oyster and Rangia shell middens, and three
consisted of prehistoric cultural material
scatters (lithics and/or ceramic). Analysis of
the lithic material recovered from the sites
revealed that the prehistoric occupations
dated as early as the Middle Archaic and
extended to the Late Prehistoric.

Surveying for shipwreck resources
is an important component of investigations
in the Matagorda Bay area. Thirty-two
anomalies that may represent shipwrecks
were found by magnetometer surveys
between 1971 and 1973. Also in 1972 and
1973, the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project conducted an intensive archeological
survey of the Matagorda Bay area in order to
provide a general cultural resource inventory
of the region. A total of 94 archeological

are to be preserved and avoided by
development.

The fieldwork for this project was
conducted on October 23, and November 12, 2007, and on May 15-16, and 22-28,
2008, and consisted of a 100% pedestrian
survey of the proposed 450 acre Beachside
development project (planning for this
pedestrian survey was informed by the
results of an initial reconnaissance-level
survey conducted in May 2007 [see below]).
The pedestrian survey was conducted in two
stages. The first stage of investigations,
conducted during 2007, argued based on the
reconnaissance that the interior areas had
been heavily disturbed by camp construction
and post-war demolition, and instead
focused the majority of efforts on an
intensive examination of the narrow corridor
(up to ca. 30 m in width) between the highly
disturbed area of the Camp Hulen grounds
and the outermost edge of the project APE.
However, this shoreline-focused approach
was determined by THC to be insufficient
for determining the potential research status
of camp-related areas, and as a consequence,
the second stage of work, which included
both additional documentary and field
investigations, was carried out in 2008.

The Reconnaissance Survey
In preparation for the current study, a
records assessment was produced in
September 2005, and an archeological
reconnaissance survey of the entire Camp
Hulen property (ca. 1100 acres) was
conducted on May 2-4, 2007. The goal of
this inspection was to determine the status
and preservation of the camp buildings and
infrastructure, and to assess the presence and
extent of camp construction and use-related
disturbances in terms of their impact on
potential locations of prehistoric cultural
deposits.
The reconnaissance identified several
partially demolished standing structures.
The majority of these, the base laundry,
armory, and two small water pump houses,
are located in the northern portion of the
camp, outside the permit area. Only three
standing structures, two brick and concrete
rubbish incinerators with intact chimneys,
and a water pump house, are located in the
permit area (Figures 2, 9-17).
Both
incinerator buildings and the pump house
have suffered the initial stages of
demolition, with the windows and door
treatments removed, and some interior walls
partially collapsed or demolished. Neither
the two incinerator structures nor the pump
house are sufficiently intact or exhibit
qualities that render them inherently
significant enough to be eligible for the
National Register.

The project area is depicted on the
Turtle Bay and Palacios, Texas 7.5' USGS
topographic quadrangle maps (Figure 1). It
consists of approximately 450 acres located
along the eastern and southern banks of
Turtle Bay, and comprises the southernmost
portion of the Camp Hulen historic military
site (41MG129). The property includes
approximately 1.4 miles (ca. 2.3 km) of
shoreline and saltmarsh, as well as inland
areas comprised of low, flat uplands. Much
of the inland zone has been heavily
disturbed
by
historic
camp-related
construction and activities, as well as more
recent demolition efforts. The property is
slated for extensive residential development,
and will include the construction of coastal
jetties, and an inland marina and system of
canals. The large wetland areas located
along the western and southern shorelines

The base’s network of concrete
roadways (which run along regimented
north-south and east-west lines) are still
intact, if somewhat overgrown in some areas
(Figure 18). Additional secondary roads are
composed of oyster shell and gravel.
Drainage ditches with some concrete
culverts parallel many of the sections of
both types of roadway. In much of the areas
within the camp, the ground surface is

settlements. Consequently, the intensive
pedestrian survey was designed to focus
most intently on the shorelines along the
interfaces of the developed areas and the
excluded wetland zones.

mantled by a thin layer of shell and gravel
(Figure 19). A number of spoil piles (some
shell/gravel and others of concrete
fragments) are located across the base.
In contrast to the camp’s previously
developed and highly disturbed inland areas,
the
shoreline
appeared
remarkably
undisturbed by construction. However, both
the western and southern shorelines are
actively eroding due to natural wave action.
Small natural berms of marine shell were
observed along much of the southern shore
(Figure 20). Several sections along the
western shoreline contained marshy areas
and or small ponds (Figures 21-22). Most of
these appear natural and would thus
represent high probability areas for
prehistoric occupations. However, as noted
above, these areas are outside of the project
APE, and are to remain unimpacted by
construction.

The Shoreline Investigations
Based on the findings from the
reconnaissance study, the 2007 pedestrian
survey concentrated on the examination of
the relatively undisturbed shoreline area
located between the project APE and the
waterline. At the time of the survey, the
APE boundary was clearly marked by a
temporary fence of rope and metal
fenceposts. The area beyond the temporary
fence, which extends to the water’s edge and
included numerous wetland areas, is to be
preserved in its present state, and will not be
impacted by any of the planned construction
activities associated with the residential
development project. Within the survey
corridor, the investigations included
systematic shovel testing and visual
examination for surface exposure of cultural
materials. In some areas, the survey was
extended beyond the permit area and into
the protected wetland areas in order to more
fully search for any possible cultural
materials located in these areas.

The reconnaissance concluded that
the inland areas contain extensive
disturbances related to the area’s use as a
National Guard and U.S. Army military base
between 1926 and 1946. While the majority
of the camp’s facilities were temporary
constructions (e.g., large tents on concrete or
shell foundations, light wood frame
buildings, etc.), several standing brick and
concrete structures still exist, and are in
various states of demolition. In spite of
these structural remains, the previous partial
dismantling of the majority of camp
facilities has greatly limited the site integrity
and resulted in a low potential for historical
significance. In terms of its potential for
prehistoric sites, the lack of sources of
natural and reliable water sources in the
property interior indicated a relatively low
probability for prehistoric occupations in
these disturbed areas.

During the 2007 shoreline survey, a
total of 45 shovel tests (ST 1-45) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through ¼” mesh (Figure 2;
Appendix 1). The location of each test was
recorded and plotted on the project map.
The majority of shovel tests were conducted
at 100 m intervals, though this interval was
reduced in some areas (see below). The
majority (n=43) of the shovel tests were able
to reach the dark clays of the underlying
precultural subsoil, and several documented
varying depths of modern disturbance and
fill. The survey determined that both the
south and west coastlines have suffered
extensive erosion, with almost all areas
beyond the APE eroded down to the
underlying clays (Figures 23-24). None of
the shovel tests produced cultural materials.

In contrast, the reconnaissance
indicated that the western and southern
shore lines of the property have experienced
only limited impacts from historic
disturbances.
These areas would have
provided access to both marshy/brackish

11

2, 27, 28). Based on the documentary
sources, it was clear that this planned canal
system overlays portions of the oldest
elements of the camp.
Archeological
subsurface survey of these areas was
expected to provide controlled information
on the survival and a nature of archeological
features.

A number of surface scatters of
artifacts and/or shell were identified during
the reconnaissance. Most contained similar
material assemblages of oyster and Rangia
shell, flakes, faunal bone, and some pottery.
Three dart point fragments were recovered
from the sandy flats along the southern
shore. These points were clearly not in
primary context, but were assumed to have
eroded from sites located nearby. The
artifact scatters were relocated during the
survey and investigated with shovel tests at
reduced intervals of 5-10 m (Figures 25-26).
These shovel tests (e.g., STs 18, 20, 21, 30,
41, 43, 44, 45) determined that each of these
scatters represented completely eroded sites,
with no remaining intact cultural deposits.

The resulting field investigations at
these eight areas followed the standard
archeological
method
termed
“area
stripping,” which is commonly employed to
locate buried historic period features in
tracts with extensively disturbed surface
soils (Figure 29). This method has been
utilized by Moore Archeological Consulting,
Inc., in urban contexts to expose
foundations, wells, cisterns, privy and trash
pits and other features, and rural contexts
primarily to locate unmarked grave shafts
within known or suspected historic
cemeteries.
Again, the documentary
evidence provided insight into which of
these categories of subsurface features
would most likely be encountered by our
stripping excavations.
For example, a
functioning sewer and water line system was
present when troops first arrived at the camp
in 1926 (Penland 1986:263), thus there
would be little chance that our investigations
would encounter latrine/privy pits. The
presence of trash incinerator buildings (one
in the pre-war camp, and two for the WWII
expansion) indicated that no trash pits or
sheet refuse would be encountered. In
addition, it was expected that any features
that had been restricted to pre-WWII use
would be limited or heavily disturbed,
because many of the examined aerial
photographs clearly showed the scars from
the movement of heavy equipment to level
and prepare the camp for intensive World
War II-period construction.

Mechanical Sampling of Camp Palacios
and Camp Hulen Activity Areas
Consultation with the Texas
Historical Commission indicated that
additional work within the Camp Hulen area
was needed (THC letter dated March 25,
2008), and that specific types of activity
areas from both WWII and pre-war eras
should be investigated. These potential
activity areas included officers and enlisted
personnel quarters, canteens, medical and
storage facilities, etc., and German prisoner
of war internment areas. To enable the
location of such areas, additional
documentary research was conducted
through the Palacios Area Historical
Association, and included informant
interviews and the collection of both textual
descriptions of the camp and copies of
various aerial photographs (dating from
1927 to 1945).
As a result of these interviews and
analyses, eight areas within the camp were
selected
for
mechanical
subsurface
sampling.
These sampling areas were
presented in the addendum technical
proposal and approved by THC and
USACE. The sample areas were located
within areas of planned impacts from the
construction of a series of canals within the
proposed residential development (Figures

Field Investigation Methods
The World War II Camp Hulen and
its more modest Texas National Guard
predecessors represent about two decades of
increasingly intensive and densely packed
land use, followed immediately by complete

dense artifact content, with the undisturbed
natural soil into which they were excavated.
Privy (outhouse) pits generally exhibit the
same color and texture differences, but are
also often lined with wooden planks. Brick,
stone, or, in the case of Camp Hulen,
concrete architectural features would, of
course, be much less subtle in appearance.
In each of the sampling areas at Camp
Hulen, the stripping investigations began
with the excavation of a 5-8 m long trench
which provided information on subsurface
stratigraphy, specifically the depth of
disturbed soils and fills, and the nature of
underlying intact soils (Figure 30). A sample
of the exposed artifacts was collected from
several of the stripping operations. In
general, the recovered artifacts dated from
the 1920s to the mid 1960s (Tables 2-4).
Among the assemblage are glass and
ceramic maker’s marks dating from the
1920s to 1950s. A few of the Coca Cola
bottles bear a trademark of December 25,
1923. Also included are modern nails, glass
fragments, and indeterminate metal.
Artifacts related to the military occupation
included spent brass rifle casings (including
a number of .30 caliber casings and
impacted bullets from either the ’03
Springfield or M1 Garand, a single unfired
.30 caliber M1 Carbine round, and even a
mangled casing from a .50 caliber machine
gun (Figure 50), rifle ammunition stripper
clip fragments, fastenings for infantry web
gear, uniform buttons, etc.

abandonment and wholesale demolition or
removal of the many temporary frame
structures on the site.
Archeologically
significant features can be mantled by
overburden consisting of fill, demolition
debris, etc., within areas that were heavily
utilized for extended periods in the early to
century.
Previous
field
mid-20th
observations in the Camp Hulen project area
suggested further that the surface soils are
extensively disturbed by repeated military
constructions on the site, and by the
demolition of almost all the military
structures after the property was declared
surplus at the end of World War II.
Area stripping is defined as the
removal of all surface obstructions
(pavements, slabs, etc.), fill deposits, and
disturbed soils over a broad area in order to
expose the upper surface of undisturbed
natural soil and any archeological remains
within that natural soil surface. Efficient
removal of disturbed soils and overburden to
expose the natural soil surface requires the
use of heavy machinery such as trackhoes or
gradealls mounted with smooth-edged
excavation buckets.
This mechanical
stripping is the most cost-efficient, surest,
and least destructive means to locate
archeological features and deposits within
densely developed historic tracts.
The fundamental goal of this
disturbed soils-removal operation is to
expose preserved archeological features.
Archeological
features
constitute
constructions such as building foundations,
wells, cisterns, and privy vaults. Trash pits
and other ‘non-architectural’ excavations
and construction are also defined as
archeological features. Such features would
have been excavated into the natural soil
surface that constituted the occupational
grade at the time of initial development of a
particular property. Downcutting to the
undisturbed natural soil grade permits the
exposure and recognition of archeological
features.
For example, generally dark,
organically-stained trash pit features will
contrast in soil color and texture, as well as

Sampling Area A, Scrape 1
The first area to be stripped was a
small zone in the northwestern portion of the
site. Identified as Sampling Area A, the
location was intended to investigate what
appears to be a large washroom structure
visible on the 1943 aerial photograph of the
camp. An initial, 12 m long stratigraphy
trench was first excavated in the northwest
corner of the sampling area. Buried by a
layer of fill and disturbed soils, intact clay
subsoils were reached at a depth of 36 cmbs.
Once the stratigraphic sequence was
established, a roughly rectangular area

13

designated as Scrape 5, consisted of an
approximately 25 by 15 m area that had
already been scraped by the construction
contractors. The majority of the scraped
areas were taken down to a depth of 70-90
cmbs. The scrape revealed a 5 cm thick
layer of disturbed soils and fill (including
whole and crushed oyster and Rangia shell)
overlying intact clay soils. Two shovel tests
(STs 3, 4) were excavated within this
scraped area. ST 3 was excavated to 36
cmbs, while ST 4 was excavated depth of 51
cmbs. These tests determined that a layer of
fill and disturbed soils, varying from 8-20
cm overlay intact soils in this portion of the
sampling area.

measuring approximately 40 by 30 m was
stripped down to the intact soil (Figure 31).
The
excavation
revealed
a
rectangular set of cedar posts near the
southwest corner of the stripped area
(Figures 32, 33). The posts measured 6
inches in diameter, and 12-18 inches in
length, with flat, sawed off bases and tops
splintered from demolition. The bases of the
posts had been sunk to a depth of 73 cm
below the current ground surface (cmbs).
The posts were set at 6 ft intervals and
formed a rectangle measuring 6 by 24 ft. It
is unclear whether this represent the
structure visible in the aerial photograph, as
that structure appears to measure
approximately 20 m in length (north-south).
However, no other evidence of architectural
remains was identified in the stripped area.

No cultural features were exposed in
Scrapes 2 or 4. Scrape 3 exposed two, 2
inch diameter, iron water pipes. The pipes
were oriented running east-west, and were
located 15 m apart. They were located at a
depth of approximately 80-85 cmbs. No
evidence of a setting trench for either of the
pipes could be discerned, either by soil color
or texture.

A number of artifacts were
encountered during the excavations,
primarily from the disturbed fill soils (Table
2). These materials included glass and
ceramic fragments, whole bottles (e.g.,
Coca-Cola, medicinal/perfume, etc.), wire
nails, and miscellaneous military debris.
Two shovel tests (STs 1, 2) were also placed
within this scrape just north and west of the
foundation. Both tests extended to a depth
of 40 cm below the base of the stripped area.
The tests indicated that the cultural materials
were limited to the fill and disturbed soils,
with no artifacts recovered from the
underlying intact sediment.

In contrast to these areas, an
examination of Scrape 5 revealed the
presence of 11 circular concrete building
piers (Figure 38). The piers appeared to be
of crude construction, and may have been
formed by simply pouring concrete into the
excavated posthole. The piers were 8-10
inches in diameter and 18 inches thick.
The piers appeared to form the
foundation for a rectangular building
measuring at least 16 by 8 m, with its long
axis running east-west. However, if these
piers are related to the north-south oriented
structure visible in the aerial photograph
(which measures approximately 20 x 10 m),
they would appear to represent the southern
end of the proposed washroom building, and
would most likely have been associated with
the two waterpipes revealed in Scrape 3,
located 45 m to the west. A number of red
clay bricks were found around the
foundation, and a light scatter of flat glass
sherds and whole and fragmented glass

Sampling Area B, Scrapes 2-5
This was the largest sampling area,
and was located just south of Area A in
order to investigate a large open area which
appeared to have contained numerous large
tents, most likely used for enlisted for
personnel quarters. A total of three areas
were stripped, Scrapes 2-4, and a fourth area
recently scraped by construction equipment,
Scrape 5, was examined (Figures 34-37).
Scrape 2 measured 20 by 5 m, Scrape 3 was
22 by 5 m, and Scrape 4 measured 7 by 6 m,
with all three areas totaling approximately
250 square meters.
A fourth area,

14

bottles was noted atop the scraped ground
surface.

The stripping excavations revealed a
total of 35 round concrete foundation piers.
Each of the piers measured 25-30 cm in
diameter. Many of the piers had been
damaged by demolition and there were
several gaps that suggested that piers had
been dislodged during the process. The
upper surfaces of the piers ranged from just
beneath the modern ground surface to a
depth of 20 cm. The foundation footprint
revealed in the stripping indicates that the
long axis (northwest-southeast) of the
structure measured approximately 50 m in
length. In addition to the concrete piers, the
excavations encountered a variety of cultural
debris, including clay and iron pipe
fragments, asbestos tiles, flat and bottle
glass, and a large number of wire nails.
Collected materials included indeterminate
metal, a metal cap, glass, and shell (Table
3).

Sampling Area C, Scrape 6
This small sampling area was
located at the southwestern corner of the
western concentration of tent quarters, atop
what appeared to be a large washroom
facility similar to that investigated by
Sampling Area A. Work in Area C began
with the excavation of a 10 m long trench,
which was excavated down through
disturbed soils and fill to intact soils at 40
cmbs. A 16 by 8 m area extending south of
this trench was then scraped down to that
depth (Figure 39). No cultural features were
exposed in Scrape 6.
Sampling Area D, Scrape 7
Sampling Area D consisted of a
long section of the proposed canal system
located near the southern end of the project
area, in a portion of the camp that contained
the hospital and other medical facilities.
Based o the 1943 aerial photograph of the
camp, the buildings within this area are
oriented along a semi-circular plan (along
the northwest-southeast intercardinals),
rather than the more regimented north-south
and east-west orientations of the rest of the
camp. Initially, a 6 m long trench was
excavated in the northern portion of the
sampling area. The trench revealed that a 34
cm thick layer of fill and disturbed soils
overlay intact clay subsoils. The trench was
then expanded to the southwest in a
rectangular area totaling 15 by 6 m (Figure
40). This revealed a series of concrete
foundation
piers.
Following
the
southernmost alignment of these piers to the
southeast resulted in a 40 by 2 m long trench
ending in a 7 by 5 m scraped area. This
resulted in a total scraped area in Sampling
Area D of approximately 205 square meters.
Three shovel tests (STs 5-7) were placed
along the scraped area. ST 5 reached a
depth of 45 cm, ST 6 was 23 cm deep, and
ST 7 was 40 cm deep. Each that confirmed
that underlying intact soils were directly
overlain by disturbed fill materials, with no
intact and undisturbed cultural deposits.

Sampling Area E, Scrape 8
This sampling area was intended to
investigate a large structure of unknown
function visible in the 1943 aerial
photograph. The structure is located along
the west outside edge of the central
concentration of tent quarters, and is one of
several similar buildings located along this
boundary (Sampling Area G investigated a
similar structure on the east side of the tent
concentration). The stripping began with a 6
m long trench that revealed a 30-50 cm thick
overburden of demolition debris and fill. A
2 inch diameter iron water pipe was located
running north-south in the east end of the
trench. Stripping began north of the trench,
and encountered several large square
concrete foundation piers, which were then
followed with shallow stripping trenches
(ca. 20-30 cm deep) to the north and west,
resulting in an irregular-shaped set of
trenches totaling approximately 200 square
meters in area (Figure 41). Two shovel tests
(STs 8, 9) were placed in the area of the
stripping. The tests, excavated to depths of
75 and 35 cm, respectively, confirmed that
intact subsoils were directly overlain by

15

disturbed fill. No cultural materials were
recovered from below the layer of fill.

inch pipe. No other cultural materials or
features were identified.

A total of 17 concrete piers were
revealed by the excavations, the majority of
which were in a single alignment extending
for 26 m (Figures 42, 43). The piers
measured 30 cm per side, and were placed at
intervals of approximately 3 ft (measured
from center to center). The alignment
appears to represent the east side of the
building. A number of the piers were
missing or out of place, suggesting
significant demolition disturbance had
occurred. Interestingly, an examination of
the surface of each pier had contained a 12
inch square concrete post at its center which
had most likely been broken off during
demolition. The identification of a single
intact pier (Figure 44) seen near the main
gate showed that the large square actually
formed a flat footing into which a 12 inch
square, 5 ft tall concrete support post was
inserted. In addition to the foundation piers,
cultural materials encountered typical
demolition debris during the excavations,
including bottle and flat glass, as well as a
number of clay sewer pipe and iron water
pipe fragments.

Sampling Area G, Scrape 10
This sampling area was selected in
order to investigate a second large structure
similar to that of Sampling Area E. An
initial 12 m long trench determined the
overburden in this portion of the camp to be
rather shallow, and consisting of
approximately 10 cm of clay and shell fill.
An additional 14 by 8 m rectangular area
located to the north of this trench was then
stripped to that depth (Figure 46).
The stripping exposed a large
oblong soil feature located in the southeast
corner of the excavation.
Measuring
approximately 5 m in length by 50 cm in
width, the feature appeared to be a footing
trench for wooden foundation piers. The
feature’s fill was a mix of silty loam, clay
loam, and clay, and some crushed shell. In
addition, a number of fragments of rotting
wood were present within the fill. A shovel
test (ST 10) placed in the south end of the
feature revealed that it extended to a total
depth of 105 cmbs.
Sampling Area H, Scrape 11
This investigation area is located in
the far northeastern portion of the tract, at
the end of a proposed canal channel. The
area was selected in order to investigate a
third possible example of washroom
facilities visible in the 1943 aerial
photograph. Work in the area began with an
8 m long trench that revealed a 30 cm layer
of fill and disturbed soils atop intact clay
sediment. A 2 inch diameter iron water line
was revealed oriented north-south across the
eastern end of the trench. A large T-shaped
area north of this trench was then stripped to
the depth of the intact subsoil surface. The
trench and stripped area included a total of
approximately 155 square meters (Figure
47).

Sampling Area F, Scrape 9
This sampling area is located in a
proposed canal channel in the northern and
central portion of the project tract. It was
intended to investigate a concentration of
small structures visible in the 1943 aerial
photograph. An initial 15 m long trench was
excavated, revealing three distinct layers of
fill totaling 45 cm in thickness, lying atop
intact clay. A roughly rectangular area north
of this trench was then scraped down to this
depth.
The stripped area measured
approximately 13 by 8 m (Figure 45). No
structural
remains
were
identified.
However, an intact clay sewer pipe and iron
water pipe were encountered in the southern
end of the stripped area (Figure 29). The
sewer pipe measured 5 inches in diameter
and was composed of 2 ft long sections,

crude construction and dimensions similar to
those encountered in Scrape 5.
Gaps
between many of the piers suggest that
significant disturbances occurred during
building demolition. A wide variety of
demolition debris was noted in the
excavated fills, and included fragments of
iron water pipes, clay sewer pipes, asbestos
tiles, and wire nails. In addition, the
excavations revealed a large intact, bricklined sewer main located in the southeast
corner of the scraped area (Figure 48). The
brick feature appeared to be intact, and a 3436 inch diameter opening, but had been
filled with soil and demolition debris.

The refuse consisted of a mixture of
whole glass bottles, euroamerican ceramic
fragments, glass fragments, indeterminate
metal and various electrical parts (Figure
49). The types of glass bottles included
cosmetic, medicine, shoe polish, ink,
beverage and culinary. Some of the bottles
are clearly diagnostic, dating from the 1920s
to the mid 1960s (Table 4). Among the
ceramics were several sherds of hotelware
marked “U.S.Q.M.C.” (United States
Quarter Master Corps) and dated September
16, 1940 (Figure 51). Based on the artifact
content, the incinerator refuse can be dated
to the early to mid 20th century.

A final trench was excavated into a
low mound located on the south side of the
smaller incinerator. The trench measured 4
m in length, and was excavated to a
maximum depth of 77 cm. The excavation

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
pump house have suffered the initial stages
of demolition, with the windows and door
treatments removed, and some interior walls
partially collapsed or demolished. Neither
the two incinerator structures nor the pump
house are sufficiently intact or exhibit
qualities that render them inherently
significant enough to be eligible for the
National Register.

On October 23, and November 1-2,
2007, and May 15, 16, and 22-28, 2008,
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation for the approximately 450 acre
proposed Beachside project on the former
Camp Hulen property (41MG129) in
Matagorda County, Texas. The objectives
of the investigation were to locate and
identify cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0784, 08-35, 08-36) were conducted for
Crouch Environmental Services, Inc. under
Texas Historical Commission Section 106
guidelines, in anticipation of the submission
of a permit application to the U.S. Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
was conducted in the narrow corridor (up to
ca. 30 m in width) between the highly
disturbed area of the historic Camp Hulen
grounds and the outermost edge of the
project APE. A total of 45 shovel tests were
excavated.
No evidence of prehistoric
archeological or historic remains or features
was identified. Surface scatters of shell and
some lithic materials were investigated by
additional shovel tests, but were found to be
disturbed, out of context materials that
appeared to have been eroded by shoreline
wave action. No associated intact cultural
deposits were identified for any of these
scatters.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the current project area was conducted in
two stages, and included both surface and
subsurface (shovel test, backhoe trench/area
stripping) examination. During the initial
stage of investigations in 2007, a visual
assessment of the entire property was
conducted, and a total of 45 shovel tests
were excavated along the property shoreline.
During the second stage of investigations,
which took place in 2008 and focused on the
Camp Hulen military base area, a total of
approximately 2500 square meters was
mechanically stripped during the sampling
of eight potential activity areas. The results
of these investigations are summarized
below.

The
mechanical
stripping
investigations
conducted
within
the
boundaries of the military camp failed to
find archaeological features that exhibit the
potential to provide new information on the
role of the camp for the Texas National
Guard, or for the US Army during World
War II. These investigations documented
the extensive nature of the destruction and
demolition of buildings and standing camp
facilities. The most numerically abundant
and widespread remains documented in the
stripping excavations were concrete
foundation piers. The exposed piers tended
to be either round or square in plan, and
showed evidence of extensive disturbance
resulting from demolition efforts (e.g.,
broken and/or missing piers). While the
presence of sections of shell walkways,
overlain by disturbed soil and demolition
debris, and underlain by sterile, undisturbed

The general survey determined that
there are three standing structures still
present within the project area. These
include a large incinerator and one smaller
incinerator which are located adjacent to
each other in the northwest corner of the
APE. The third structure is a small water
pump house located near the main camp
entrance. Both incinerator buildings and the

47

natural soils, indicate that the occupational
surface of the camp is preserved in a few
places, the majority of the investigated areas
appear to have experienced significant
disturbance and some truncation during the
demolition of the majority of the camp’s
standing structures. Further, the exhaustive
stripping investigations failed to disclose
evidence of preserved sheet refuse, most
likely due both to extensive demolitionrelated disturbances and to the Army's
penchant for strict sanitary practices (e.g.,
periodical “policing” to collect surface
refuse).

confirmed that all but the most massive of
the above-ground elements (i.e., the
incinerator plants) of the camp had been
removed and recycled elsewhere, or simply
demolished and carried away. What was left
to be exposed by the stripping program was
confined to underground foundation and
utility components such as concrete piers
and water and sewer pipes. The sum of
this evidence leads to the conclusion that the
archeological component of Camp Hulen
within the Beachside project is not eligible
for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places.

In terms of the potential for locating
preserved subsurface cultural resources, we
found abundant archeological evidence of
various modern infrastructural elements that
would have precluded the formation of
archeologically informative features and insitu deposits. For example, the camp’s
extensive water supply and sewage
treatment system, evidenced by both utility
trench/pipeline remains and documentary
evidence of the treatment plant, precluded
the need for privies. Additionally, the
disposal of refuse in trash pits or other
primary contexts was precluded by a
succession of incinerator plants fed by an
organized trash collection system. Finally,
the results of the exhaustive stripping
program failed to disclose any unanticipated,
but meaningful classes of subsurface
archeological features or deposits.

Consequently,
no
further
archeological
investigations
are
recommended. In order to expedite the
construction of the interior canal system, an
interim report detailing the results of the
mechanical sampling investigations was
submitted to the THC and USACE on May
30, 2008, and concurrence with its findings
was obtained on June 19, 2008. The
artifacts and historical records collected for
this project will, in keeping with the wishes
of the Landowner and the concurrence of
THC, be donated to the Palacios Area
Historical Association for use in its area
historical educational programming.
In the event that archeological
deposits or features should be encountered
during construction, work should cease in
the immediate vicinity and the Archeology
Division
of
the
Texas
Historical
Commission
contacted
for
further
consultation.

In summary, the investigations
conducted within the Camp Hulen property
