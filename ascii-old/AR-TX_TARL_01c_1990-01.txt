in measured drawings. Two lx2 meter units were excavated in
two areas within 41VV930, Skyline Shelter.

Unit 1 reached a

depth of 2.6 meters and yielded faunal remains indicative of
a

Archeological Background

The Lower Pecos River region is the smallest of the
defined cultural areas of Texas (Brown et al. 1983).

It is

generally defined by the extent of the distinctive Pecos
River pictograph style and by the commonality of materials
found in dry rock shelter deposits.

The core is the area

surrounding the confluences of the Devils and Pecos rivers
with the Rio Grande, west of the modern community of Del Rio
and east of the hi$torically famous hamlet of Langtry.

In

terms of modern political units, the region centers in Val

Unfortunately, no description was written and the notes have

In the late 1950s,

the pending construction of Lake

Amistad prompted the National Park Service to institute a
salvage program.

The

step was

with dung and limestone dust but it is unlikely that the
site ever contained significant deposits.

was probably subsidary to 41VV1266, the larger site slightly
upstream on the same canyon.

under a very slight overhang, a blob of red paint was noted
but not recorded as a separate site.

Thick-walled bones of the size range

found regionally only in bison were recovered from levels 8
through 14.

Based on the radiocarbon date of 3100±80 from

Level 13 and the Marshall points attributable to levels 8,
11, and 15, these strata slightly predate the Late Archaic
bison kills at Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain 1968) and
correlate well with Prewitt's (1966)
del Diablo site.

findings at the Piedra

The massive amounts of charcoal in these

same levels agree with a hypothesized winter occupation of
the site,

perhaps when bison herds drifted south to avoid

severe winters on the Plains.
The calcaneus of an immature bison was recovered from
Level 20 (Fig. lla).

The specimen is very large, exceeding

in several dimensions the cutoff point between Bison bison
and Bison antiquus documented at Bonfire Shelter
on the Rio Grande near Langtry

(41VV218)

(Dibble and Lorrain 1968) .

Above the radiocarbon date of 5150+70 derived from charcoal
in Level 22 and in a zone dominated by Pandale projectile
points, this one bison bone seems slightly out of context.
Bison antiquus is generally thought to have disappeared from
the southern Plains by 8,000 years ago (McDonald l981:Figure
100) but enduring on the northern Plains until about 5,ooo
B.P.

(McDonald 1981:

Molluscan Remains from skyline Shelter,

Val Verde county, Texas (41VV930)
by Raymond Neck

Introduction

Molluscan

remains

have

been

noted

in

archeological

sites in dry limestone shelters in the Lower Pecos area for
decades.

Most notable have been the occurrences of large

numbers of huge individuals of terrestrial gastropods of the
genus Rabdotus and occasional valves of freshwater mussels.
Both gastropods and mussels have been presumed to be food
items,

because dry rock shelters provide suitable habitat

for neither mollusc.

Shells of Rabdotus alternatus were

perforated and strung on lecheguilla threads as necklaces
(Martin

1938).

Although

the

use

of

molluscs

by

the

aboriginal populations in the Lower Pecos area has long been
assumed by various workers, no analysis of screened samples
from essentially undisturbed cultural deposits has been made
available.

limestone bluff above the Devil's River at the confluence

mussel normally found in slow-moving shallow water with a
mud

substrate.

for

A.

imbecillis in cultural deposits are rarity in prehistoric

species

of

freshwater mussel that is normally found in water of several

depth.

The

species

is

also

rarely

found

in

archeological sites, but the likely reason is believed to be
a postulated reluctance of aboriginal individuals to dive in
water of more than shallow depth (over 2 meters).
