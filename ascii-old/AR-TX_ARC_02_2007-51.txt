ABSTRACT
AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a cultural resources survey of
approximately 8.66 miles of an equestrian/biking trail, a 7 acre lake site,
borrow pit and revisited sites 41WD640 and 41WD641 within the Mineola
Preserve on the Sabine which is owned by the City of Mineola in Wood
County, Texas. The City of Mineola will receive a grant from the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department for the trail but will construct the lake with
city funds.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if cultural resources were
present, make recommendations about their significance and how they
might be impacted by construction. No cultural materials older than 50
years were seen on the ground surface during the archaeological survey
and no buried cultural materials were discovered during excavation of
ninety-one shovel tests and four backhoe trenches. During the testing of
site 41WD641, a few flakes, pottery sherds and fire-cracked rock and a
mano were seen on the ground surface. However, no buried cultural
deposits were discovered in 32 shovel tests. No cultural materials were
seen on the ground surface or in the banks of the borrow pit. The lack of
buried deposits at the tested sites makes them ineligible for nomination to
the National Register of Historic Places or as State Archeological
Landmarks.
Based upon the lack of significant buried of surface archaeological site
deposits, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that the City of Mineola be
allowed to construct the equestrian/biking trail and the lake. Furthermore,
we further recommend that future trail routes should avoid high potential
areas such as ridges or other elevations. If buried cultural materials are
discovered during construction, work should stop in that area and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be
notified. If buried cultural materials are discovered within the Sabine
River’s floodplain, the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of
Engineers also should be notified. Work should not continue until
discussions with the proper agency have been completed.

INTRODUCTION
The Mineola Nature Preserve on the Sabine River is a three thousand acre park that is
being developed by the City of Mineola. The Preserve is located approximately 1.25
miles southeast of downtown Mineola. The park is bound on the south by the Sabine
River and most of the acreage consists of floodplain. The upland extends from the north
into the floodplain in the form of narrow north-south oriented finger ridges. Several
remnant upland knolls are present in the floodplain. Most of the park consists of
undeveloped and unsurveyed land except for a short loop trail, a parking lot and an
education center that are located on a finger ridge in the north central portion of the study
area. Construction of these features was not done in the locations where the original
survey was conducted and as a result two prehistoric sites, 41WD640 and 641, were
discovered as a result of the construction. These sites were reinvestigated during this
survey. The abandoned earthern berm of the Union Pacific Railroad crosses the park from
northwest to southeast and has been designated site 41WD636. US 69 is the western
boundary of the Preserve and CR 2724 is the northern boundary. The Mineola
Wastewater Treatment plant is outside the Preserve boundary in the northwest corner of
the property.
Mineola has been awarded a grant by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD)
to construct an 8.66 mile long equestrian/biking trail that circles the northeastern twothirds of the Preserve (Figure 1). The Texas Historical Commission (THC) required that
an archaeological survey of the trail route be surveyed for cultural resources. The trail
will be west and east of the railroad berm and sections of the trail will be placed upon the
berm. The initial park developments were surveyed by AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) in
2004 (Todd and Trask 2004). After the survey, the trail route was moved to cross a finger
ridge and subsequent erosion exposed artifacts that were noted by Mr. Mark Walters, the
Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Steward for Wood County. He recorded
two new prehistoric sites (41WD640 and 641). In addition to the survey of the
equestrian/biking trail, ARC tested to define the limits of the newly recorded sites and a
borrow pit that had been excavated without a survey. Also, site 41WD372 was
investigated. Although not in the original study area, the proposed equestrian/biking trail
came close to what was perceived as the site boundaries, and the THC requested that
ARC determine if the site was present within the proposed trail route. The area of a
recently proposed seven acre lake also was surveyed which possibly might impact site
41WD372 also was surveyed as part of this investigation.
During the fall of 2006 and in 2007 as well, ARC conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the proposed trail route and lake site. We also defined the limits
of sites 41WD372, 640 and 641. This work was done under the authority of Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 4289 and would be relevant to satisfying federal legislation
were a permit needed from the US Army Corps of Engineers.
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description of the

natural environment and cultural history of the study area and vicinity. This is followed
by the research design and methodology. The results of the investigation follow. The last
chapter presents recommendations that arise from the study. A list of references cited
concludes the report.

NATURAL SETTING
Wood County is located in northeastern Texas approximately 80 miles east of Dallas and
30 miles north of Tyler. The Post Oak Savannah where the study area is located includes
the western and central parts of the county and contains such vegetation as post oak and
blackjack oak trees along with tall grasses. The Piney Woods vegetation area in the
eastern portion of the county has softwoods such as loblolly, shortleaf, longleaf, and slash
pine and hardwoods such as oak, hickory and maple. The county is drained by series of
interconnected streams. The Sabine River forms Wood County’s southern boundary and
its watershed drains the county. The topography varies throughout the county. The
western part has level to undulating terrain and sandy soils overlying clayey subsoils. The
central part has gently rolling to hilly terrain and reddish loamy soils over clayey
subsoils. The eastern part of the county is nearly level and has sandy to loamy soils
overlying very deep subsoils. The climate is subtropical, mild and moist (Gilbreath
2003:1).
The bedrock geology of the study area consists of the Eocene-aged Queen City Sand
which is covered by Quaternary-aged fluviatile deposits and alluvium (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1965). The Preserve includes soils that belong to the WoodtellFreestone, Wolfpen-Pickton and Gladewater-Estes soil associations. The soils range from
gently sloping to moderately steep upland loams and clays to nearly level floodplain
clays (Hatherly 2000:General Soils Map). A variety of soil types are in the Preserve area,
but the ones encountered during this survey were primarily Freestone fine sandy loam
with 1 to 3 percent slopes, frequently flooded Gladewater clay and Manco loam and
Woodtell loam with 5 to 15 percent slopes (Hatherly 2000:Sheet 34). The deepest
expected topsoil belongs to the Freestone fine sandy loam which is 10 inches (25
centimeters) below the surface.
Blair (1950:98) places Wood County in the Texan Biotic Province. Besides the
vegetation previously mentioned, the province contains at least 49 mammal species, 9
lizard species, 39 snake species and 18 amphibian species. The Texas Province also
contains both Terrapene species, T. ornata, the western box turtle, which is a grassland
species and T. carolina, the eastern box turtle, which is a woodland species (Blair
1950:101–102).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Major archaeological investigations have been carried out in Rains and Wood counties in
conjunction with the construction of Lake Fork Reservoir and the Big Sandy Project
(Bruseth, Bagot, Banks and McKinley 1977; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Perttula, Skiles,
Collins, Trachte and Valdez 1986). Two major historic Native-American sites, Limerick
and Pearson (Duffield 1959; Johnson and Jelks 1958; Duffield and Jelks 1961), were
excavated at Lake Tawakoni in nearby Rains County, and several important sites were
tested and then excavated at Lake Fork (Bruseth and Perttula 1981). A reconnaissance of
the proposed Carl Estes Lake [formerly known as Mineola Reservoir] recorded several
sites in the area located between Lake Fork and Lake Tawakoni (Malone 1972). The
members of the Dallas Archeological Society located the historic Norteño focus Gilbert
site on the edge of the Lake Fork Reservoir and then held a Texas Archeological Society
Field School in Archeology there in 1962 (Jelks 1967).
The following chronological framework relies heavily upon “This Everlasting Sand
Bed”: Cultural Resources Investigations at the Texas Big Sandy Project, Wood and
Upshur Counties (Perttula et al. 1986) and Prehistoric Settlement Patterns at Lake Fork
Reservoir (Bruseth and Perttula 1981). The reader is urged to read these reports for more
detailed information. Additional information is referenced in the text. The chronological
classification consists of

Only meager evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation has been recovered in the region, and,
invariably, this time period is represented by projectile points recovered from mixed
contexts. Meltzer and Bever (1995:Table 1) report two Clovis points from Wood County,
but none to the south in Smith County. Plainview, Dalton, San Patrice and Scottsbluff
projectile points have been recovered from sites along Lake Fork Creek. Unfortunately,
none of the points have been found in context with extinct Pleistocene-aged megafaunas.
Bryant and Shafer (1977:19–20) state that Paleo-Indian peoples were probably
generalized hunter/gatherers rather than big game hunters.
Early Archaic people occupied terrace and upland projections as did the earlier PaleoIndian people. Sites appear to be small suggesting a mobile life way with poorly defined
territorial boundaries and food resources appear to be generalized. There is some

suggestion of trade networks based on lithics used for dart projectile points. The Middle
Archaic is the first really recognizable archaeological unit in the Upper Sabine Basin.
Sites are concentrated within major basin systems and are usually single-component.
Subsistence appears to have concentrated on nuts and deer. Metates are found on the sites
indicating the occurrence of plant processing. Chert resources are non-local; therefore, a
trade system was established by this time. Late Archaic sites occur near springs, springfed branches and on small to large tributary streams as well as on elevated landforms
adjacent to streams and natural lakes. Sites have sedentary aspects suggesting definable
territories and a higher population. Exploitation of plants and animals seems to have been
generalized. Utilized lithic resources appear to be local and petrified wood was used,
again emphasizing a defined territory.
The Early Ceramic period is recognized by the presence of pre-Caddoan ceramics. Two
different ceramic technologies occur, one based on sand-temper and another based on
grog- and sometimes bone-tempered ware. The lithic artifact assemblage changed little
from the Archaic. Gary points appear to dominate the projectile point types. Earthen
middens containing storage and trash pits, hearths and other indications of relatively
permanent multi-seasonal occupations indicates that single-family homesteads may have
been occupied for one or two generations. Agriculture is inferred from the presence of
charred maize, but flotation analysis emphasizes the reliance on plant foods including
acorns and other nuts.
Early Caddoan components and sites are common throughout the major drainage basins
on major streams and tributaries to those streams. The bow and arrow appeared during
the Early Caddoan period and agriculture appears to dominate the plant food economy
although wild plants were still being used. Sedentary communities and farmsteads are
located adjacent to arable land. Mound centers along the Sabine indicate the presence of a
hierarchical social and settlement structure. The most common types of Early Caddoan
settlement in the Upper Sabine, however, are hamlets and farmsteads containing 1 to 3
middens. These middens represent small habitation areas and burials are found in the
middens. The Tadlock site, 41WD82, recorded by Southern Methodist University on
Lake Fork Creek is an Early Caddoan (Sanders Focus/Phase) site located on a combined
upland remnant/alluvial terrace in the Lake Creek Fork valley. The site consists of three
middens. The emphasis was on wild plants although corn and other cultigens were
processed. Several pipes were found indicating the use of tobacco or, at least, some plant
for smoking. Interestingly, lithic tool materials came from Red River gravels and Central
Texas instead of the poorer local material (Perttula 1995).
Middle Caddoan times appear little differently than Early Caddoan times in the Upper
Sabine River. The Carlisle site, 41WD46, probably typifies Middle Caddoan sites and
components in the major drainage basins. The site is located on the tip of an upland
projection overlooking the Sabine River floodplain and actually extends into the
floodplain and stops approximately 30 meters from the river bank. The site is located
below the confluence of Lake Fork Creek and the Sabine River. The portion of the site on
the upland projection appears to have contained a house structure based on the presence
of daub and a mud-dauber’s nest. The portion of the site in the floodplain is a midden.

Lithic materials were dominated by chert, but quartzite, chalcedony and petrified wood
were used. Ceramics were grog- and bone-tempered (Perttula, Skiles and Yates 1995a).
Late Caddoan sites are most common within the Dry Creek and Caney Creek drainages
and along Lake Fork Creek between these streams in Wood County. The settlements still
consist of small farmsteads and hamlets, mound centers, but cemeteries occur
consistently, usually containing about 10 individuals. Settlements along Lake Fork seem
to have occupied only for 20 to 50 years. Reliance on agriculture (corn) appears to
dominate the food base although there was some use of deer and other animal resources.
The Goldsmith site, 41WD208, located on Dry Creek consists of a house structure with
an associated midden and cemetery. Local materials were used to make tools and the
ceramics were grog-tempered. Although corn and beans appear to be the staple diet, nuts
and other wild plants were also used. Wild animals eaten include deer, rabbits and other
wild game. Dog burials were noted also at the Goldsmith site (Perttula, Skiles and Yates
1995b).
No historic Native-American habitation sites have been discovered in Wood County,
although no doubt Caddoan groups such the Nadaco or Anadarko were in the area.
Historic Native-American sites have been discovered in Rains County. These Norteño
focus sites were probably short term habitation sites and were occupied while fur trading
(Duffield 1961; Dufflield and Jelks 1961). European artifacts were eroding out of Mill
Creek’s bank approximately 8.5 miles east of Mineola and about 5 miles north of the
Sabine River. Arrow points and broken gun barrels, lead balls, a copper cross, a silver
coin and other relics were found in about a 2 mile wide area. Based upon the wide
dispersal of artifacts it was felt that a battle occurred between the Native Americans and
the Spanish that either began at a spring several miles southeast of Hainesville and moved
to Mill Creek or the reverse (Woldert 1989:484-489). .
Wood County was explored in 1788 by the Spaniard Pedro Vial who was going from
Natchitoches, Louisiana to San Antonio. The first Caucasian to settle permanently in the
county was Martin Varner in 1824. Wood County was organized in 1850 when it was
separated from Van Zandt County and named after Texas governor George T. Wood who
held office from 1847 to 1849. Mixed feelings abounded concerning secession from the
United States among the residents of Wood County although the county residents
provided men and supplies to the Confederacy. From 1870 to 1920, the agricultural-based
economy dominated and corn and cotton were the staple crops. Various railroads were
built throughout the county between 1870 and 1920, and manufacturing began to gain a
toehold during the period. During the Great Depression, the county’s population began to
decline, but the discovery of oil in 1941 reversed the trend. By the 1970s, the population
had increased and the county moved from the agricultural base to one that relied on beef
and dairy cattle and manufacturing. Tourism has become an economic base with the
annual Dogwood Festival and Old Settlers Reunion in Quitman along with several
recreational lakes (Gilbreath 2004).

Sodom was the original name for Mineola until 1873 when the name was changed. The
city government was organized in 1873 and the post office was established in 1875. The
town was incorporated in 1877. Besides timbering, economic activities included raising
cotton, livestock, fruit and berries. Along with highway improvement, the Magnolia
Pipeline Company gas line and the establishment of a railroad resulted in economic
growth for Mineola. This growth was aided by the petroleum industry and a T&P railroad
shop coming to the city during the 1940s. The city’s economy diversified from farming to
watermelon crops and cattle raising. Later, other economic pursuits included sweet-potato
farming, a creamery, a nursery and a company that supplied telephone poles and
pulpwood to the telephone company. By the 1980s, manufacturing and food packaging
provided further employment for the inhabitants of Mineola (Bruner 2004).
Previous Investigations
Bob Skiles recorded several archaeological sites in the area surrounding the Preserve.
The sites are Caddoan in age and some consist of hamlets with associated cemeteries
according to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2006). Several sites were recorded in
the proposed Preserve area. These sites include 41WD43, 370, 371, 372, 382, 392 and
632. Additional sites that are on the border are 41WD418 which is immediately north of
41WD372 and 41SM165 which is across the river and east of site 41WD392.
Unfortunately, site forms are available only for 41WD43, 382 and 632. Site 41WD43, a
Caddoan Fulton Aspect site, recorded by Bob Skiles, consists of a lithic scatter, animal
bones, mussel shells, several arrowheads and a few potsherds (Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas 2006). Sites 41WD382 and 41WD632 are located in the northwest corner of the
Preserve. Site 41WD382 was recorded by Bob Skiles and revisited Paul Price Associates,
Inc. (Schroeder 1997) during a survey of the proposed Mineola city’s wastewater
treatment plant. The site was multi-component and included historic glass, ceramics and
metal. The site was radiocarbon dated and yielded an Early to Middle Caddoan age. The
prehistoric component included fire-cracked rock, lithic tools and debris, pottery, bone
and ground stone fragments. Site 41WD632 was recorded during an archaeological
survey for FM 564 (TxDOT 1974). It also was multi-component and contained firecracked rock, cermics, lithic debris and nails. The site was tested for National Register of
Historic Places (NHRP) eligibility by PBS&J (Cliff and Perttula 2002). Prehistoric
artifacts consisted lithic debris, fire-cracked rock, ceramics, points, ground stone, daub,
and wood and seed fragments which were either Late Archaic or Early Ceramic in age
and Early Caddoan. The artifacts that constituted the historical portion of the site were
not listed. The site was determined to be ineligible for listing on the NHRP.
Previously, AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Trask 2004) conducted an archaeological
survey of a proposed access road route, a proposed parking lot site, an education center
site with a wildlife viewing platform, a hiking trail route and a nature trail route within
the limits of the Mineola Preserve on the Sabine River. No prehistoric sites were recorded
but an old railroad berm upon which a section of the hiking trail was ultimately
constructed was recorded as site 41WD636.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

Research Design
Based upon the available information described in the previous chapter, two hypotheses
were formed.
First, based upon the results of archaeological surveys in the area,
prehistoric sites should be found on ridges overlooking the Sabine River
floodplain and on sandy elevations above flooding in that floodplain.
Second, since transportation routes form the study area’s western, northern
and northeastern boundary, the potential for a historic residence is high in
the northern part of the preserve. The potential for historic sites within the
floodplain was considered low due to seasonal flooding.
Methodology
The proposed trail route is to be about 10 m wide and the depth of impact is
approximately 30 cm. Shovel tests were excavated at 100 m intervals along the trails at
the request of the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission. Shovel tests
along the equestrian/biking trail were excavated to approximately 30 cm below the
ground surface, the anticipated impact of the trail construction. Occasionally, shovel tests
were supplemented by augering with a 4-inch bucket auger. The sandy loam was
screened through a ¼” hardware cloth screen and all shovel test walls were visually
inspected for cultural materials. Clay matrices were broken manually and inspected.
Notes on the soil, vegetation, landforms and other relevant information were taken, as
were photographs.
Backhoe trenching was deemed unnecessary due to the shallow depth to the subsoil (20
cm) and the shallow depth of impact along the proposed equestrian/biking trail, but the
standard of a backhoe trench for every three acres as recommended by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (2002) was exceeded for the lake site. Backhoe trenches were
excavated to depths ranging from 2 to 2.5 m and were 5 m long. Since OSHA standards
were followed, more soil matrices were examined than that of a 1x5x3 m trench. Backhoe
trench descriptions follow Vogel (2002). One archaeologist monitored the backhoe trench
excavation while the other examined the removed soil matrices.

RESULTS
The following chapter is divided into several parts. The equestrian/biking trail was the
focus of the archaeological survey and is presented first. The description of the lake site
follows. Descriptions of the revisited sites, 41WD640 and 641, and the borrow pit are
then presented. Conclusions derived from the survey ends the chapter. Shovel tests are
described generally in the text and specific information about individual shovel tests is
listed in various tables.
Equestrian/biking trail
This portion of the report is broken into several parts. The trail relocation is discussed
first. The survey of the rerouted equestrian/biking trail to the railroad berm is discussed
next and followed by the description of the archaeological survey west of the railroad
berm.
Trail relocation
Although it was expected that site 41WD372, which consists of a scatter of ceramics and
flakes, would not be impacted, it was decided that shovel testing would be implemented
to insure that the area-of-potential effect (APE) does not extend into the site and the trail
was relocated away from the site to insure that the site would not be impacted. The
rerouted trail southwest of site 41WD372 was placed where the lake was to be
constructed. The trail was rerouted again and crossed south of the borrow area and north
of the lake and dam.
Shovel tests 28 through 32 (Figure 2) uncovered 15 to 40 cm of sandy loam overlying
sandy clay subsoil at depths ranging from 15 to 40 cm bs. A second sandy loam was
encountered in ST 32 which extended from 10 to 27 cm bs. The shallow depth to the
subsoil indicates that the area probably has severely eroded over time.
Equestrian/biking trail east and to the railroad berm
The equestrian/biking trail and the shovel test locations are shown in Figure 3. Survey
began at the bottom of the hill east of Site 41WD640 and went northeast, generally
southeast and then southwest and terminated at the railroad berm. Due to the poor ground
visibility northeast and southeast of site 41WD640, shovel tests were excavated at 100 m
intervals with a few exceptions and are described in Table 2.
Understory vegetation along this portion of the route includes saw greenbriar, honey
suckle, berry vine, prickly pear, snow-on-the-prairie and other grass and bush species.
Trees include mesquite, honey locust, American elm, winged elm and oak. Ground
visibility was mostly less than 10 percent but ranged to 100 percent along the eroded
ridge and where hogs had rooted up the vegetation and created wallows. Eye-height
visibility ranged from less than a meter to 50 m. The terrain ranged from generally level
to moderately sloping.

Shovel tests from rerouted trail to the railroad berm plotted on a portion of
the Mineola, Texas 7.5’ USGS map

Shovel tests 21 through 27 and 33 through 54 were excavated along ridges, ridge slopes
or upland locations. Shovel tests 21 through 27 were augered when it was felt necessary
due to their closeness to archaeological sites. The rest of the shovel tests were excavated
to approximately 30 cm bs. Shovel tests 21 through 27 uncovered sandy loam overlying
sandy loam and sandy clay subsoils at various depths.
Shovel test 33 was excavated at the base of a small ridge approximately 200 m east of ST
32 due to the presence of a shallow drainage. The shovel test uncovered 10 cm of clayey
loam overlying clayey loam subsoil that extended to 25 cm bs. Shovel test 34
encountered 28 cm of gravelly loam overlying a gravel lens and STs 35 through 43
encountered loam to 39 cm bs.

Loam overlying clayey loam subsoil was uncovered in STs 44 through 47, but ST 48
uncovered 52 cm of loamy clay. Shovel test 49 encountered 15 cm of sandy loam
overlying sandy loam subsoil overlying mottled very fine sandy clay at 21cm and the
shovel test was terminated at 24 cm bs. Forty-seven cm of sandy loam overlaid the
mottled sandy clay found in ST 49 to 60 cm bs. In ST 51, 9 cm of sandy loam overlaid
very fine sandy clay subsoil that extended to 25 cm bs.
Shovel tests 52 through 54 were excavated along the north-south trending ridge. The
ridge appears to have been artificially leveled and a dirt, two-track road follows the ridge
to what possibly was a structure. Metal siding was unseen but detected when it was
walked on, but its actual purpose could not be determined because it was so heavily
covered with berry vines. The shovel tests indicate that the sandy loam topsoil as shallow
over the sandy loam subsoil or sandstone bedrock. Sovel tests 55 through 57 were
excavated on the slopes of the north-south trending ridge. Ground visibility usually
ranged less than 30 percent. The shovel tests encountered sandy loam overlying loamy
clay subsoil except for ST 57 which encountered 33 cm of loamy clay subsoil.
Shovel tests 58 through 84 were excavated in the floodplain and uncovered clay. Prior to
ST 77, a small drainage, about a m wide and 0.5 m deep, had to be crossed. Water was
present but was less than 0.25 m deep in a clay substrate. On the west side of the drainage
a two-track dirt road was encountered (Figure 4) on which the proposed trial is to be
constructed. The road was probably used for transporting logs. Shovel tests 77 through 84
were excavated in undisturbed areas outside the logging road.

Figure 4. Lance Trask is standing on the old logging road (?) that runs from the unnamed
tributary to the Sabine River to the railroad berm. Note the good ground
visibility. View is to the west.

Equestrian/biking trail west of the railroad berm
Survey began west of the railroad berm and looped north and then back east to the
railroad berm. The proposed trail route parallels an unnamed drainage just south of
CR2724 and is almost all in the floodplain. The terrain is generally level but is cut by
small drainages (0.5 m wide and deep) and wide sloughs (30 m wide and 2 m deep).
Understory vegetation includes johnson grass, saw greenbriar, grape vine, hog weed,
blood weed and other grass and bush species. Trees included oak, mesquite, hackberry,
American elm, winged elm and bois d’arc. Logging must have occurred prior to World
War II because the largest trees looked to be about 65 years old. Eye-height visibility
ranged from 30 to 100+ m. Ground visibility ranged from less than 10 up to 100 percent.
Good ground visibility is illustrated in Figure 5. Shovel test locations along this portion
of the route are shown in Figure 6.
Numerous frogs and water beetles were noted along the sloughs, but fish and turtles were
virtually absent. This probably due to the fact the area had been severely flooded. One
freshwater mussel (Pyganodon grandis complex) the valve of a Corbicula sp. were
found. The P. grandis shell was deposited about 30 m from the slough. One large beaver
den on the side of a slough was found. Two wild hogs and a water moccasin also were
encountered.

Shovel test 85 was excavated about 50 m west of the railroad berm and exposed 18 cm of
silty clay overlying mottled loamy clay subsoil that extended to 37 cm bs. Shovel tests 86
through 95 encountered either shallow silty clay overlying clay subsoil or silty clay
indicating the depositing of recent alluvial sediments over older floodplain clays.

Figure 6.

Shovel test locations from the railroad berm west plotted on a portion of
the Mineola, Texas 7.5’ USGS map.

From ST 96 to 104, the proposed trail route appears to follow an old logging road similar
to that shown in Figure 10 and shovel tests were excavated in undisturbed areas adjacent
to the road. Silty clay ranging to 40 cm bs was uncovered in Shovel tests 96 through 100,
107 to 112 and in 114 through 116. Shallow silty clay overlaid clay subsoil in STs 101,
105, 106 and 113.
A small drainage crossing which is approximately 1.5 m wide and contained water about
0.5 m deep was discovered between STs 111 and 112. A bridge had been constructed
across this drainage as indicated by the 3 metal I-bars across the drainage (Figure 7). The
I-bars are approximately 298 inches long, 4.5 inches wide and 9 inches tall. Two of the Ibars are welded to extend to 298 inches while the third was complete. The bridge was not
recorded as a site. Also 3-hole perforate bricks were present along the drainage’s banks.
An internet search and an examination of Gurcke’s (1987) book on bricks and
brickmaking failed to yield a date when the bricks were made. Probably, the bricks were
used in the late 1960s or early 1970s.

From ST 116 to ST 117 is approximately 900 m. A road across the floodplain was
created by removing soil from the floodplain and building the road above the floodplain
surface as indicated by the large wetland areas present on both sides of the road (Figure
8). No shovel tests were excavated along the road for that reason. ST 117 was excavated
where the archaeologists thought the road ended but encountered 20 cm of mottled sandy
clay unlike any encountered during previous shovel tests. This was taken as further
evidence of disturbance.
Shovel tests 118 through 120 were excavated on the hill slopes where the proposed trail
route departs the dirt road and turns east to rejoin the railroad berm. Ground visibility
ranged from less than 10 to about 30 percent. Shovel test 118 uncovered 7 cm of sandy
loam overlying mottled sandy clay subsoil that extended to 39 cm bs. Thirty-five cm of
sandy loam overlying sandy loam subsoil was encountered in ST 119, but ST 120 only
encountered 34 cm of very fine sandy loam but no subsoil. The railroad berm was east of
ST 120.
Lake site
The proposed lake site is to cover approximately 7 acres and is to be constructed adjacent
to a north/south oriented intermittent drainage with a 15 feet high dam. Since the lake site
is to be constructed within a drainage, backhoe trenching was concentrated on about a 3
acre plot where the soil is to be removed and used to construct the dam. Also, three

shovel tests supplemented by augering were excavated along ridges adjacent to the lake
boundary. The lake area was walked by the archaeologists in northwest-southeast
oriented transects spaced 30 m apart. The proposed equestrian/biking trail route will be
placed across the dam.

It was intended to excavate the backhoe trenches to 3 m below the ground surface, but,
based upon the shallow depth to the subsoil, the trenches were excavated from 2 to about
2.5 m below the ground surface. Also, four backhoe trenches were excavated instead of
three. The first three were excavated where the soil was to be removed to construct the
dam, but the fourth trench (4) was excavated about 5 m east of the lake boundary and
west of site 41WD372 to determine whether site 41WD372 extends into the buffer
between the site and the proposed lake area.

The backhoe trenches and shovel tests locations are shown on Figure 2 and the backhoe
trench and shovel tests descriptions are listed in Tables 4 and 5. The following discussion
is a general overview of the results of the backhoe trenching and the shovel tests are
described in detail. All of the backhoe trenches and shovel tests were culturally sterile
and no cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface. Site
41WD372’s extent is shown on Figure 13.
The A horizon consists of a sandy loam that is generally about 30 cm deep except for
backhoe trench (hereafter BHT) 4 where it is 20 cm. Backhoe trench 1 (Figure 9) is
unusual in that it has two lower A horizons which is probably due to material moving
downslope from the adjacent ridges. Sand filled root casts and animal burrows can be
seen in the Bt horizon of BHT 1.

Figure 9.

Northeast wall profile of BHT 1. View is to the northeast.

The deep E1 horizon found in BHT 2 at 220 cm below the ground surface was
encountered at 205 cm in BHT 3 and the backhoe trench was terminated at that point.
However, the deep E1 horizon was not found in BHT 4, but a shallow E horizon was
encountered and is shown in Figure 18.
Although shovel tests STs 28 through 32 already had been excavated along the trail route
and were culturally sterile, three additional shovel tests were excavated. Shovel test 121
was placed at the northwest corner of the proposed lake site and uncovered 20 cm of fine
sandy loam overlying subsoil that consists of a mixture (50% each) of mottled sandy
clays containing hematite gravel that extended to 41 cm. Below the subsoil was mottled

sandy clay that ranged to 55 cm below the ground surface. Shovel test 122 was excavated
also along the ridge southeast of ST 121 and uncovered the same soil matrices as ST 121
but the contacts were at 12 and 17 cm, respectively, and the shovel test was terminated at
32 cm below the ground surface. Placed on a bench southeast of BHT 4, ST 123
encountered 43 cm of fine sandy loam overlying mottled sandy clay subsoil that ranged
to 93 cm which was underlain by a mixture (50% each) of very fine sandy clay and sandy
clay.

Site 41WD641
Site 41WD641 is located along a northeast-southwest trending ridge. A hiking trail
passes across the ridge top. The original trail had been flagged north of the ridge and
investigated by AR Consultants, Inc. in 2004 (Figure 10). However, the trail was built
along the southern portion of the ridge and site 41WD61 was discovered and recorded by
Mr. Mark Walters, Archeological Steward for Wood County, while walking the trail. The
site’s age ranges from prehistoric to historic because lithic debris, a bifacially ground
mano, and historic ceramic shards were found on the ground surface.

Figure 10.

Vegetation on ridge where site 41WD641 is located. View is to the
north.
AR Consultants, Inc. was unable to find the lithic debris and historic ceramic shards. No
doubt, the recent rains allowed a dense cover of vegetation to cover the site. However, the
mano was found. Vegetation along the ridge consists of berry vines and coastal Bermuda
grass (Figure 11). One excavated hole, about 50x50 cm and 20 cm was found and it
appears that the area recently had been probed by looters. Numerous gopher mounds are
present along the ridge, but no cultural materials were found on them. Ground visibility
ranged from less than to about 10 percent and eye-height visibility was excellent.
Since only the mano was found, it was decided that shovel tests 1 through 9 would be
oriented northeast-southwest to test the ridge. Additional shovel tests, STs 10-13 were
placed perpendicular to the northeast-southwest axis and to further determine the site’s
boundaries (STs 14 and 15). Shovel test locations are shown in Figure 12. All of the
shovel tests were culturally sterile. The site limits shown in Figure 11 are based upon the
mano and where Mr. Walters discovered cultural material.
Shovel testing revealed that sandy loam was underlain by a different sandy loam in STs
3, 4 and 5. The sandy loam ranged from 22 to 52 cm bs. The loams overlaid a sandy clay
subsoil which in turn was underlain by mottled sandy clay at depths ranging from 33 to
86 cm. The shovel tests were terminated from 65 to 111 cm bs. The shovel test

Site 41WD640
Flakes were seen on the ground surface in an area between two parking lots during a visit
to site 41WD640 on May 23, 2007 but were unable to be found during a June 22, 2007
visit. The flakes may have washed away during the heavy rains between the site visits.
During the site investigation, five shovel tests were excavated and specific matrix
descriptions are provided in Table 7 and shovel test locations are shown on Figure 12.

Figure 12.

Locations of STs 16 through 20 plotted on a portion of the Mineola, Texas
7.5' USGS map

No shovel tests were excavated adjacent to the pavilion and activity areas southwest of
the parking lot, which is essentially where the site is, as shown on the USGS map, due to
the excellent ground visibility and the subsoil on the surface (Figure 13) or on the east,
west and south sides of the parking lots due to the rather steep slope. However, two areas
(Figure 14) where park construction and improvements have not impacted the soil are
between the parking lots.

These areas were intensively surveyed for cultural materials but none were found. Shovel
test 16 was excavated in the southern island and ST 17 in the northern island. The shovel
tests uncovered shallow sandy loam overlying sandy loam subsoil which in turn was
underlain by sandy clay and by clay. Shovel test 2 was excavated in the northern island
area during the original survey and no cultural materials were found in it either.
Three shovel tests were excavated north of the fence that marks the northern boundary of
the parking lot. Shovel test 18 was excavated about 3 m north of the parking lot and
approximately 7 m northeast of an existing concrete trail, ST 19 was placed 15 m east of
ST 18 and ST 20 approximately 15 m from ST 19. The shovel tests uncovered the same
soils which consists of sandy loam overlying sandy loam subsoil underlain by clay. The
shovel tests were all culturally sterile and no cultural materials were seen on the ground
surface.

Borrow pit
The borrow pit (Figure 15) is approximately 75 m long and 25 m wide. It contained water
at the time of our visit. The northern slope is at about a 45 degree angle while the
southern slope is vertical. No buried cultural materials were seen in the pit walls or
adjacent to the pit. Dirt excavated from the pit was examined but no cultural materials
were found.

Conclusions
No residences were shown on the USGS map or the Wood County soils book (Hatherly
2000), but a possible historic residence might be present along the ridge where STs 52
through 54 were located. It appears that the ridge has been artificially leveled, and any
residence may have been removed. Otherwise, the absence of historic sites along CR
2427 is hard to explain. The absence of historic sites, except for the railroad berm, in the
Sabine River’s floodplain is probably due to seasonal flooding.
Based upon the literature and information derived from the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (2007), ridges appear to have been occupied by the Caddoan people and probably
Archaic as well since no diagnostic material was found associated with 41WD372.
Possibly the area adjacent to the Sabine River may have been occupied by Late Archaic
peoples. Although the evidence is slim, Archeological and Environmental Consultants
(Perttula and Nelson 1998) recorded site 41WD584 which contained a Gary point along
the Sabine River. The other two recorded sites (41WD583 and 585) along the river
contained lithic debris and a hammerstone. An alternative hypothesis is that the sites are
Caddoan in age, but lithic reduction was occurring during temporary occupation of the
site during hunting or fishing activities. In the immediate vicinity of the study area, the
above three sites were the only ones recorded adjacent to the Sabine River. Interestingly,
no sites have been recorded away from the river and in the floodplain within the study
area.

A brief review of the archaeological sites on the Atlas northwest and southeast of the
study indicates that a Paleo-Indian and Caddoan sites are present along the ridges.
Unfortunately, no data is available for several of the sites along the river, but the
information available did not describe an Archaic occupation, although site 41SM5,
southwest of the study area and adjacent to US 69, consisted of lithic and historic debris.
Possibly the lithic debris may have been associated with an Archaic occupation.
Based upon the testing of sites 41WD372, 41WD640 and 41WD641, ridge sites appear to
be on the surface along the ridges and no buried artifacts are present unless they are in the
plow zone or slightly below due to downward movement within the study area. Except
possibly for pottery, no diagnostic artifacts or charcoal is present for dating and no
organic materials have been found.
During future archaeological surveys, elevations above flooding in the floodplains
obviously should be examined. Sandy elevated areas may contain both Archaic and
Caddoan components based upon Bob Skiles’ experience in the area (Bob Skiles 2003).
We recommend shovel testing for shallow impact areas, but due to the unknown
subsurface deposits of the Sabine River’s floodplain, deep testing is recommended for
deeper impacts. Ridges and knolls invariably should be examined. A case in point is the
northeast-southwest oriented knoll (locally referred to as Turkey Island) in the southwest
portion of the park which is adjacent to the river. Bob Skiles visited the knoll and, based
upon the lithic debris, felt that the heavily potted site was Archaic in age. However, he
did not rule out that Caddoan component might be present based upon a 35 year memory.
The best analogy to the site is the Yarborough site (Johnson 1961).
Both sites are located on knolls in the floodplain and within 50 meters of the Sabine
River. Numerous dart points and lithic debris were discovered on a midden on top of the
Yarborough site, and, according to Bob Skiles, it appears that the knoll had been heavily
pot hunted to recover points. In addition, Skiles made an interesting observation. He
discussed a knoll site about two miles west of Turkey Island which contained two bases
of Clovis points in the red clay subsoil. He stated that on the knolls that he has
investigated from the Yarborough site to Turkey Island, Paleo-Indian points were present.
Since Turkey Island holds the same potential, it should be investigated thoroughly in
future park surveys. Also, we recommend that at least 30 cm of the clay subsoil should be
tested before a shovel test is terminated.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Since no archaeological sites were discovered during the intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the proposed equestrian/biking trail and lake site, AR
Consultants, Inc. recommends that the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission allow the City of Mineola to proceed with the construction of the proposed
equestrian/bicycle trail and lake. However, if buried cultural materials are encountered
during construction, work should immediately stop in that area and the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be contacted. Also, if buried
cultural materials are encountered within the Sabine River’s floodplain, the Fort Worth
District of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps of Engineers) should be
contacted. Work should not continue until the proper discussions with the THC, the
Corps of Engineers or both.
Based upon the lack of depth to site 41WD641, the absence of diagnostic artifacts, it is
deemed ineligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or as State
Archeological Landmarks. However, for sites 41WD640 and 41WD372, no statement
can be made about their potential for their suitability for eligibility for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places or as State Archaeological Landmarks because only
a portion of the extent of site 41WD372 is known and the site itself was not tested.
Possibly site 41WD640 could extend further north than where was tested or further east
of the pavilion parking lot which was not tested. For these sites, we recommend either
further testing or the sites be protected. In fact, AR Consultants, Inc. recommended that
the known sites be covered with a meter of fill and vegetation be planted to protect the
sites. Preferably, the planted vegetation should be some bush species that will act as a
barrier. The sites should be regularly monitored by park personnel. We again stress the
importance of sites 41WD372, 640 and 641 being protected. Site 41WD641 is in an
excellent location for people to remove artifacts and the fear that diagnostic artifacts
might be removed is a real one.
