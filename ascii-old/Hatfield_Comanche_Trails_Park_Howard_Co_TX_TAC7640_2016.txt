Abstract
Hatfield Archaeological Services, LLC, conducted historical research and a cultural
resources survey for a section of Comanche Trails Park along the historic spring and
Cosden Lake in Big Spring, Howard County, Texas in May of 2016 for KDC Associates.
The cultural resources survey included an intensive pedestrian survey and subsurface
reconnaissance conducted on May 13-14, 2016. Two previously recorded archeological
sites occur within the project area—41HW1, a multicomponent site, and 41HW74, a
lithic scatter of unknown age. Both sites were revisited during the survey. Two historic
structures also occur in the project area, a pump house that has largely been removed and
a dam. Archival research focused on the dam and pump house. Based on the findings of
the survey and research, only one portion of the 41HW74 is recommended for further
testing.

Introduction
Hatfield Archaeological Services, LLC conducted archival research and a cultural
resources survey in May of 2016 for the proposed development of a portion of Comanche
Trails Park, along Cosden Lake in the City of Big Spring, Howard County, Texas (Figure
1). The Area of Potential Effects (APE) is 9.1 acres. The depth of impact for some of the
proposed development will exceed the depth of archeological deposition in the area;
however a portion of the proposed development will occur on previously disturbed or
eroded portions of the park. The purpose of the survey was to identify and evaluate
cultural resources within the APE and determine if any archaeological sites or historic
structures are eligible for listing with the National Register of Historic Places or as State
Historic Landmarks. The survey documented a previously recorded archaeological site,
the remnant of an historic structure that consisted solely of a concrete slab, and a dam
that may date to historic times but is now covered with concrete. Another archaeological
site was previously recorded along the southern edge of the APE; however this site was
identified during the survey and likely does not continue into the drainage as mapped.

Description of the Project
The proposed development of Comanche Trails Park is for the enhancement of the park
and to provide an historic and prehistoric interpretive area for the city park (Figure 2).
KDC proposes to build an interpretive plaza directly over an existing asphalt loop drive
(Area 2), a concrete trail over the existing asphalt trail (Area 3), an observation platform
on the existing dam and an observation platform adjacent to the concrete trail (Area 6), an
interpretive walk in the swale adjacent to the spring (Area 1), two parking areas (Areas 5
and 7), a sidewalk and open air pavilion along the larger parking lot (area 7), and a
decorative turtle (Area 4). In addition, they will remove a portion of the dam (area 6).
Much of the proposed development will occur on currently existing asphalt or concrete
surfaces, but some of the development will impact site 41HW74, which has some buried
deposits.
Given that the project development will involve different levels of impact, the
recommendations are given here by area. The numbers marked on Figure 2 indicate the
different areas of the proposed developments. Area 1 is the swale where a path and
natural area will be constructed. This area has been trenched with a backhoe and one
shovel test was excavated a portion of the area is composed of gravels and exposed rock.
Construction will include the removal of trees and the construction of pathways where
only dirt trails currently exist and will impact the subsurface deposits; however this area
has already been impacted by the construction of a drainage trench and the burial of
modern trash. It also consists of exposed rocky exposed surfaces that will not be
impacted by the project. No archaeological deposits were noted and no significant
archaeological or historic sites will be impacted by the proposed modifications in this
area. Areas 2 and 3 consist of asphalt or concrete areas that will have new surfaces on top
of the existing paths. No new impacts will occur. The construction of the turtle figure
(Area 4) will occur on a rocky exposed and deflated area, but will involve the placement
of objects on the deflated rocky surface. Although site 41HW74 falls within this area, the
site in Area 4 is a low-density lithic scatter on a deflated rocky surface with thin to no soil
development.
Area 5 is a small parking lot that will primarily be constructed on top of preexisting
asphalt or concrete surfaces. Construction will impact subsurface deposits on the western
edge where 41HW74 occurs as a low-density scatter. This area was shovel tested and the
area is not recommended for further testing. Area 6 is the dam, the slab from the pump
house, and the existing modern observation platform. The dam will be breached during
construction, however it has already been heavily modified and is currently covered with
gunite concrete. Area 7 is the location of a large parking lot and a pavilion. Construction
will impact subsurface deposits. Deposits are predominantly thin in this area, but an
archaeological site, 41HW74, occurs within this area and, along the northeastern edge,
there is some potential for buried deposits. This part of the project is a second phase of
construction and is dependent on further funding. Area 8 consists of areas that will not be
disturbed in any way by the construction of the project.

Environmental Setting
The project area falls on the southern edge of the Llano Estacado, which extends across
northwestern Texas and eastern New Mexico and is defined by escarpments on its north,
east, and west sides and merges with the Edwards Plateau to the south (Fenneman 1931;
Holliday 1997; Hunt 1974). The Edwards plateau extends across central and west Texas
and is bounded the Llano Estacado to the north, the Pecos River and the Chihuahuan
Desert to the south and the Balcones escarpment in the south and east. The climate is
continental and semiarid, with hot summers and cold winters (Russell 1945). Howard
County receives less than 19 inches of rainfall annually with significant loss to
evaporation in summer. The Llano Estacado is an expansive outwash plain with slight
topographic relief such as playas and draws, which trend northwest to southeast. The
draws are tributaries of streams that include the Brazos and Colorado Rivers on the
Rolling Plains to the east (Holliday 1997:10). The Ogallala Formation underlies this
region and is capped by the “Caprock Caliche” and widespread Pleistocene eolian
Blackwater Draw Formation deposits (Holliday 1997:10). The project area is mapped as
Quaternary deposits, undivided that are “sand, silt, clay, and gravel: locally indurated
with calcium carbonate (caliche); includes point bar, natural levee, stream channel, sand
dune, terrace, alluvial fan, landslide bolson and playa deposits” (Barnes 1992).
The Llano Estacado is on the southern boundary of the Kansan Biotic Province (Blair
1950). The vegetation in the region is mixed prairie grassland dominated by little
bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerargii), grama
(Bouteloua sp.) three-awn (Aristida spp.), broomweed (Gutierrezia texana), and buffalo
grass (B. dactyloides) among other grasses (Blair 1950:110–112; Holliday 1997:9). There
are a few trees, dominated by mesquite, in draws and canyons, but trees are otherwise
absent on the Southern High Plains. Currently, the Llano Estacado is under cultivation,
primarily for cotton, and is used for cattle pasture. The biotic community once included
bison (Bison bison), black bear (Ursus americanus), and mountain lion (Felis concolor),
and continues to include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis
latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), gray fox (Urocyon cinereorgenteous), black tailed prairie
dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), northern grasshopper
mouse (Onychomys leucogaster), southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus), and other
fauna (Blair 1950).
The project area is situated adjacent to the historically documented spring. Currently, a
man-made lake, Cosden Lake, is next to this spring, separated by a dam. Several draws
feed the lake as well as the reservoir originally fed by the now defunct spring. The
Colorado and its tributaries occur about 1 km north of the APE. Within the project area,
soils are Eckor-Rock Outcrop Complex adjacent to the head of the spring, and Ecktor
soils, moist, 1 to 8 percent slopes (Web Soil Survey 2016). The Ecktor series are shallow,
well drained soils above limestone bedrock and form in calcareous loam residuum
derived from limestone. These soils derived from limestone mostly of Cretaceous age,
but some are of Permian or Pennsylvanian age (Web Soil Survey 2016). The spring that
is located along the southern portion of the project area is sourced from an aquifer at the
boundary of the Llano Estacado and the Edwards Plateau and consists of lower

Cretaceous limestone and sands (Brune 1981). It is one of several springs and sinks in the
area, but is unique in the degree of decline creating the heavy flow and large size of this
spring (Livingston and Bennett (1944).
Cultural History
Previous investigations in the Big Spring area include a survey of Big Spring Draw in
Comanche Trails Park in Big Spring by Litwinionek and Johnson (1998) that overlaps the
current project area. A few other projects include a survey of the Big Spring landfill
(Rush 2014), a survey for the social security administration building (Hunt 2001), a
survey for a wind farm (Tomka, et al 1998), a survey of a dirt bike trail at Moss Creek
Lake (Hartnett, et al 2006), as well TxDOT surveys (i.e. Houk 2004). At this time, 138
archeological sites have been recorded within Howard County (THC Site Atlas, May
2016).
The cultural history of the Southern High Plains region is traditionally divided into five
periods: Paleoindian (11,500-8500 B.P.), Archaic (8500-2000 B.P.), Ceramic or Late
Prehistoric (2000 B.P.-A.D. 1450), Protohistoric (A.D. 1450-1650), and Historic (A.D.
1650 - 1950). The Paleoindian period so far is the earliest known human occupation in
this region and consisted of hunter/gatherers who hunted now extinct mammals,
including mammoth, bison antiquus, and other Pleistocene fauna, and later hunted
Holocene fauna (Hofman 1989; Johnson and Holliday 2004). They relied on blade
technology and lanceolate projectile points. The earliest of these Paleoindian people are
known as Clovis, named after a site located near Clovis, New Mexico (Holliday 1997).
Within the project area, 41HW1 was previously recorded and included Clovis points and
mammoth remains (THC Site Atlas, May 2016). Subsequent Paleoindian groups in this
area are the Folsom and Plainview cultures who used similar technologies to hunt large
faunal species in a highly mobile lifeway (Hofman 1989; Holliday 1997). The warming
climate at the end of the Pleistocene and beginning of the Holocene led to increasing
seasonality and changes in vegetation patterns that included the development of the shortgrass prairie in the Southern High Plains (Johnson and Holliday 2004; Holliday 1997).
The Archaic period is often subdivided into the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic and is
marked by the appearance of barbed projectiles and plant processing tools and an
increase through time in the utilization of plants (Johnson and Holliday 2004). This
period is not well documented on the Llano Estacado, with only a few known sites in the
Southern High Plains. The Lubbock Lake site (Holliday 1997) to the north of Big Spring,
Texas and 41HW1, located south of and partially within the project area (THC Site Atlas,
May 2016), have Archaic occupations. The Lubbock Lake site includes activity areas
indicating camping and bison processing activities, whereas the Archaic occupation at
41HW1 is documented only by the presence of projectile points.
The Ceramic or Late Prehistoric period marks the appearance of ceramic artifacts and
bow and arrow technology (Johnson and Holliday 2004). Only a few sites on the Llano
Estacado date to this period. The early part of the Ceramic Period has Archaic style
projectile points as well as arrow points and ceramics. The latter part of the Ceramic

period is more mixed with Puebloan style pottery and Plains style hunting weaponry
(Johnson and Holliday 2004). 41HW1 artifacts include El Paso Brownware and
Chupadero Black on White pottery, indicating Ceramic period peoples occupied the
springs during this time (THC Site Atlas, May 2016).
The Protohistoric period documents the transition from the prehistoric to the historic
period and includes Antelope Creek phase sites and Wheeler/Garza complex sites (Baugh
1986; Johnson et al. 1977). Trade with Rio Grande and Pueblo groups to the west and
ceramic cultures to the east, as well as European trade ware, appear at this time in sites on
the Llano Estacado (Baugh 1986). The Protohistoric is also marked by the arrival of
Spanish explorers into the Southern High Plains (Hofman 1989). Comanches, Kiowas,
Apaches occupied the Llano Estacado and surrounding region as mobile hunter/gatherers
during the proto-historic and historic period (Almaraz 1994; Flint and Flint 2005; Morris
1997). Spanish explorers (members of the Coronado expedition) were the first Europeans
to create written descriptions of the occupants of the Llano Estacado and described the
Querechos (possibly ancestral Apaches) and Teyas (also known as Jumanos). It is likely
that Spanish explorers visited the spring within the project area since it was a well-known
water source on the plains. Cabeza de Vaca, during his travels in AD 1534-1535,
describes the Colorado River and springs somewhere in the vicinity of Big Spring that
may have included the spring within the project area or nearby Moss Spring (Hallenbeck
1970; Pickle 1980). Francisco Vásquez de Coronado may also have visited these springs
in AD 1542 (Bolton 1990; Pickle 1980: 21). Contact between European and Native
Americans was intermittent at this time, but the Comanche and Apache were noted in this
area (Campbell 1983; Pickle 1980).
The Historic period witnesses the expansion of Europeans onto the plains, with more
Spanish exploration followed by buffalo hunters, the U.S. Military, sheepherders,
ranchers, traders, and settlers (Johnson and Holiday 2004). The Comanche and Apache
continue to dominate this region in the early part of the historic period. Figure 3
illustrates historically documented trails used by Comanche as well as trails used by
wagon trains, Spanish explorers, and the U.S. Military. Captain Randolph Marcy is the
first Anglo American to document his visit to the spring, which he described in his
journal on October 3, 1849 (Pickle 1980:10). Pickle (1980:10) quotes from Marcy’s
journal:
This appears to have been a favorite place of resort for the Comanches, as there
are remains of lodges in every direction; indeed our Comanche guide tells us that
he has often been here and that there was a battle between the Pawnees and
Comanches in which his brother was killed. He also informs me that there is a
good wagon route from here to the Rio Pecos, striking some 70 miles lower down
than where we crossed, keeping entirely to the south of the Llano Estacado and
crossing the head branches of the Colorado (Concho).

Marcy’s route parallels the Comanche trails (see Figure 3). Following Marcy’s visit,
Lieutenant Nathaniel Micheler traveled from the Double Mountains in the north and
came to the spring in Big Spring, Tx on December 21, 1849 (Pickle 1980:11). Other U.S.
Military subsequently made their way to the spring, most notable was Robert E. Lee, in
April 1856 (Pickle 1980:12). Settlement and growth of the town of Big Spring did not
occur until the railroad came through in the 1880s. Water was a critical resource for Big
Spring. The Texas and Pacific Railroad (T&P) purchased the property in 1881 that
included the spring within the project area; however Arza Alderman purchased one

section in 1890 that was adjacent to T&P property and above the aquifer that fed the
spring (Pickle 1980:180). The village of Big Spring was located along Sulphur Draw
(Beals Creek) roughly 1.5 miles north of the spring (Pickle 1980:180). T&P developed
the spring as a water source. The springs in the Big Spring area were the sole source of
water for the town in the early history of its growth. Water haulers were used to bring
water into the town from the springs. The town attempted to drill for water a few times,
but found the water to be salty; thus T&P and the town negotiated with Alderman who
developed a well field on his property that supplied the town and the railroad (Pickle
1980:359). Subsequently, the spring dried up and has never been active again.
The spring at Big Spring is one of the few places on the Southern High Plains that has
had recurring human occupations throughout the prehistory and history of the region,
undoubtedly due to the water source and the protective nature of the draws. The sites
located within the project area, 41HW1 and 41HW74, as well as other sites around
Cosden Lake, reflect repeated visitation and occupation of this area. One of the goals of
the development of this area is to highlight the importance of this area through
interpretive displays.
Methods of Investigation
Prior to field investigations, a search for previously recorded archeological sites within or
near the project area was conducted using the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeological Sites Atlas. Additional archival research of this location was also
conducted and focused on the Texas and Pacific Railway and the construction of the
pump house and dam located at the historic spring. This research included the Texas
General Land Office Archives (GLO), THC Site Atlas, Perry-Castenada Library at UT,
Howard County Circuit Court, the Heritage Museum of Howard County, the University
of North Texas Library, The Portal to Texas History, and the Texas Tech University
Library.
Field investigations consisted of a 100% pedestrian survey of the project area. Shovel test
excavations and backhoe trenching were conducted judgmentally within the project area
to evaluate the subsurface deposition. The shovel tests (ST) were 40 cm in diameter and
all sediment removed was screened through ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth. For this project,
nine shovel tests were placed in areas where the subsurface was not exposed. The rest of
the APE was not shovel tested because it had good subsurface visibility due to deflated
deposits with exposed gravels from the C Horizon or the Rk Horizon or exposed bedrock.
Figure 4 illustrates the location of the shovel tests (ST) and backhoe trenches (BT).
Backhoe trenching occurred along areas with the potential for subsurface deposits, in this
case along the southeastern edge of the APE. The backhoe trenches were excavated with
an excavator with a 60 cm wide bucket. Deposits were briefly sorted for artifacts. Figure
4 illustrates the shovel test and backhoe trench locations. Photographs were taken of the
project area, the historic structures, the ground surface, and shovel tests. Field records for
the survey consist of field notes and digital photographs.

Results of Investigation
Hatfield Archaeolgoical Services, LLC conducted a cultural resource investigation in Big
Spring, Howard County, Texas, which consisted of a background review of previous sites
and surveys, a pedestrian survey, limited shovel testing, and backhoe trenching of 9.1
acres within Comanche Trails Park adjacent to Cosden Lake (see Figure 4). The
background review through the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas
indicated there were two archeological sites within the project area (41HW1 and
41HW74) and four more within 1.5 km that include 41HW3 (0.43 km to the northeast),
41HW2 (0.65 km to the northeast), 41HW6 (1 km to the east), and 41HW7 (1.2 km to the
east). Ground surface visibility was excellent (75-100%) within the APE for this survey
(Figure 5). The subsurface reconnaissance consisted of nine shovel tests and two backhoe
trenches to evaluate buried sediments within the APE (Figure 4, Table 1). The shovel
tests revealed sediment ranging from 24 to 54 cm in depth (Table 1). The backhoe
trenches were excavated along the southwest portion of the site within the site boundaries
of 41HW1. Backhoe Trench 1 (BT1) was 4.2 meters (m) long, 0.6 m wide, and 0.63 m
deep terminating on concrete that extended across the bottom of the trench (Table 1,
Figure 6 and 7). This trench revealed modern trash fill (amber bottle glass, metal, and
concrete) that probably is from construction activity in the park from the 1980s or 1990s.
BT 2 was 2.6 m long, 0.6 m wide, and 0.83 m deep, terminating in the Rk Horizon
consisting of cobbles (Figure 8). Above this was predominantly B Horizon silt loam with
a thin A Horizon. To the south of both backhoe trenches is a modified drainage ditch
lined with concrete and rocks, suggesting this area has been disturbed. No prehistoric or
historic cultural materials were observed in the backhoe trenches or on the surface in this
area.

The project area consists of uplands, colluvial slopes, and drainages. Artifacts from
41HW74 exposed surface of the upland and deflated colluvial slops. Previous collections
were evident by the piles of artifacts noted during the survey. People visiting the park
clearly collected artifacts and consequently significantly impacted this site. Figure 4
illustrates the archaeological sites revisited in this survey, 41HW1 and 41HW74.
41HW1, the Big Spring Mammoth Site, was first identified in 1965 when a mammoth
mandible was observed in the draw south of the spring. Nearby a reworked Clovis point
was identified. This portion of the site was eroding into the draw south of the spring
(THC Site Atlas, May 2016). Subsequent visits to the site in 1969 could not relocate the
mammoth deposits. Additional cultural material associated with this site include hearth
features and an extensive lithic, ceramic, and historic artifact scatter that included Clovis,
Darl, Marcos, Marshall, Cuney, Scallorn, Perdiz, Bonham, and Garza projectile points,
metal projectile points, El Paso Brownware, and Chupadero Black on White pottery
(THC Site Atlas, May 2016). The site is associated with Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric and historic occupations and is a significant archaeological resource.
Although this site overlaps the southern edge of the project area (Figure 7), the two

backhoe trenches and one shovel test excavated within this portion of the APE found no
evidence of cultural material suggesting the site does not extend into the swale on the
northwest corner of the 41HW1 site area. A brief survey of the 41HW1 site outside to the
south of the project area did identify the lithic scatter upslope from the southern edge of
the project area. Based on our investigation, the construction of the paths for this project
will not impact 41HW1.
41HW74 was originally identified as a lithic scatter in 1998 during an archeological
survey along Big Spring Draw in Comanche Park (Litwinionek and Johnson 1998). They
conducted a 100% pedestrian survey, excavated four shovel tests within the site area, and
documented 54 lithic artifacts, none of which were diagnostic. In our survey, materials
were found further west and southwest from the original site location and the site
boundary was extended across the northern and western portions of the project area
(Figure 4). The site likely extends outside the APE to the east and west. We excavated
eight shovel tests within the site, six along the northern edge and two on the southeast
edge of the APE. The lithic scatter is a moderate to heavy density scatter along the
northeastern portions, but very light in density on the northwestern and southwestern
portions. All stages of manufacture were represented in the lithic debris including cores,
core rejuvenation flakes, middle and late stage reduction flakes, thinning flakes, and
some broken bifacial tools and edge modified flake tools (Figure 9). The lithic materials
were dominated by Edwards chert with some Colorado River gravels and tentatively
identified Alibates. One historic (pink solarized) bottle glass fragment was observed from
the surface of the northeast corner of 41HW74. Artifacts were observed in the eight
shovel tests located on 41HW74 and consisted of thinning flakes, one biface fragment,
and a few core rejuvenation flakes. A possible hearth feature was also identified in ST5
between 28-36 cm in depth (Figure 9). The site has some buried deposits, particularly
along the tree line south of the cleared area on the northeast portion of the APE (See
Figure 4). However, most of the site is located on eroded/deflated rocky sloping and
upland surfaces. The proposed project will, for the most part, not impact this site, with
the exception of the construction of the large parking lot and the pavilion (Area 7) on the
northeast portion of the project area.

Archival documents indicate the Texas and Pacific Railway (T&P) surveyed Township 1
South, Block 32 between 1873 and 1882. The project area falls with Section 7 of Block
32, along the southwest quadrant (GLO; Howard County Circuit Court documents).
Figures 11 and 12 illustrate Section 7, Block 32, Township 1 South from 1870 and 1880
(Gast 1870; Wise 1880). This survey was done in agreement with the State of Texas in an
effort to establishment railroad lines westward from Dallas/Fort Worth. The land grant
scrips are dated 1873 and 1877 and the land grant was patented July 24th, 1879 (GLO).
T&P conveyed tracts of Section 7 to the City of Big Spring at some unknown date, as
well as to the Big Spring Hunting and Fishing Club in 1952, the State of Texas in 1952,
Big Spring Country Club in 1956, and the First National Bank in Dallas, Trustee for
Cosden Petroleum Corporation Pension Trust (FNBD) in 1956 and 1967 (Howard
County Circuit Court deed records). Several additional land transfers were made, such as
the conveyance of some tracts from the FNBD to the Fort Worth National Bank as
Trustee for the Dora Roberts Foundation Trust (FWNB) in 1970, prior to the city
obtaining all of the land within the project area. The spring in particular was conveyed to
the City of Big Spring in December of 1967 from FNBD. The City of Big Spring
obtained additional tracts within Section 7, Block 32, Township 1 South from Big Spring
Hunting and Fishing Club in 1958, from FNBD in 1967 and 1972, and from FWNB in
1970 (Howard County Circuit Court documents). By 1972, all of the project area was
owned by the City of Big Spring.
Historic structures within the APE include a dam and a foundation of a pump house, both
built in the late 1800s by the Texas and Pacific Railway. The spring became the property
of the Texas and Pacific Railroad (T&P) in 1881 (Pickle 1980). Arza Alderman
purchased one section adjacent to T&P property in 1890 that was above the aquifer that
fed the spring (Pickle 1980:180). The village of Big Spring was established along
Sulphur Draw (Beals Creek) about 1.5 miles north of the spring (Pickle 1980:180). T&P
developed the spring as a water source and it is presumed that the pump house and the
dam were constructed at this time. Initially, the springs around Big Spring were the sole
source of water for the town and required water haulers to bring water to the town. As the
town grew, they drilled for water but found the water to be unpotable and salty (Pickle
1980:359). Alderman developed a well field on his property that pumped and supplied
the town and the railroad with water (Pickle 1980). Subsequently, the spring dried up.
The spring does not run today and water is pumped in from Cosden Lake, a man made
water reservoir. The majority of the pump house was removed some time ago and only a
concrete foundation of the original structure remains (Figure 13). The project will not
impact any part of the remnants of the original pump house. A recently constructed
observation platform now exists in the location of the original pump house. The dam has
also been extensively modified through time and is currently covered with concrete
(Figure 14 and 15). The current project proposes to remove a portion of the dam along
the south end.

Recommendations
The objectives of this investigation were to identify and record all cultural resources
within the project area and provide preliminary assessment as to their potential eligibility
for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NHRP) and as a State Historic
Landmark (SAL). An intensive pedestrian survey of 9.1 acres was conducted on March
13-14, 2016. Surface visibility was excellent within the project area. Nine shovel tests
were excavated within the APE. As a result of these investigations, two archeological

sites were revisited, 41HW1 and 41HW74 and two historic structures were reviewed. No
new archaeological sites were identified.
The sites are assessed for eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 USC
470 et seq.; 36 CFR 800) and for designation as a State Archeological Landmark under
the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26). The NRHP criteria of significance (36 CFR
60.4) are:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and
culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects of state and
local importance that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feeling, and
a.

that are associated with the events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or

b.

that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or

c.

that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic value, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinction; or

d.

that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
prehistory or history.

Criteria considerations: ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical
figures; properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes;
structures that have been moved from their original locations, commemorative in
nature; and properties that have achieved their significance within the past 50
years shall not be considered eligible for the National Register of Historic Places
(36 CFR 60.4).
41HW1
The portion of 41HW1 that occurs within the APE, based on the THC Site Atlas map,
contained no evidence of archaeological deposits. The site was identified, as a lithic
scatter, outside of the project area to the south. Because 41HW1 does not extend into the
APE, it could not be evaluated for its potential to yield information important to the
prehistory or history of the region. 41HW1’s eligibility for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places (36 CFR 60.4(d); 36 CFR 800.4) or as State Archeological Landmark
(13 TAC 26.8(1) is undetermined.
41HW74
41HW74 was previously recorded within the APE and, during the current survey, both
prehistoric and historic materials were observed on the surface and within the eight

shovel tests. The shovel tests were excavated in the areas with deposition and indicate a
small portion of this site, along the northeastern portion of the APE, may include buried
deposits. However, the majority of the site is a lithic scatter on rocky deflated surfaces.
41HW74 is a lithic scatter predominantly located on thin to deflated soils. It ranges from
a low-density scatter of artifacts along the western half of the site to a moderate to highdensity scatter along the northeastern edge. Buried deposition was noted downslope of
the highest density lithic scatter and may be re-deposition from the small hill. One
historic artifact (pink solarized glass bottle fragment) was noted. The site area with the
potential for buried deposits occurs in a part of the APE that is scheduled as a second
phase of development (see Area 7 in Figure 2 above). The other portions of the site will
have little to no impact on cultural resources. HAS recommends that the majority of
41HW74 is not eligible for listing on the NHRP or SAL, but the northeastern edge of
41HW74 should be considered eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places (36 CFR 60.4(d); 36 CFR 800.4) or as State Archeological Landmark (13 TAC
26.8(1), based on the potential for buried deposits to contribute important information
about the prehistory of the region.
Historic Properties
Historic structures within the APE include a dam and a foundation of a pump house, both
built in the late 1800s by the Texas and Pacific Railway. The project will not impact any
part of the remnants of the original pump house. Since the only remnant of the historic
pump house is the concrete foundation, it is not considered eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places (36 CFR 60.4(d); 36 CFR 800.4) or as State
Archeological Landmark (13 TAC 26.8(1). The dam has also been extensively modified
through time and is currently covered with concrete. The current project proposes to
remove a portion of the dam along the south end. Given the heavy modification of the
original dam, it doesn’t have potential to contribute to our understanding of the history of
the region and is not considered eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places (36 CFR 60.4(d); 36 CFR 800.4) or as State Archeological Landmark (13 TAC
26.8(1).
