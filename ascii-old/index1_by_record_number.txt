Shafer argues wear patterns on Gower points may be the
result of use as projectile points instead of being used for
cutting and slicing of wood as Kelly (1979) has proposed.
Additional observations concerning this type are
presented.
Shafer presents insight of how prehistoric peoples were
able to survive from local foodstuffs in seemingly harsh
environment of South Texas.
Report of two dart points with asphalt on stems from
locations along Aransas River. Perdiz and Scallorn arrow
points recovered with no asphaltum suggests that asphalt
used during Archaic.
