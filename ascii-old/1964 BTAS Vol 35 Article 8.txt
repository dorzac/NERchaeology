West Indian Seal Remains From Two Historic
Sites in Coastal South Texas
GERALD G. RAUN
ABSTRACT
West Indian seal remains, represented by canine teeth only, are reported from
two historic sites in southern Texas. These teeth were probably trade items and do
not definitely established the West Indian seal as a former inhabitant of the Texas
coast. Their occurrence in pre-Columbian sites has not been recorded.

The occurrence of several interesting mammalian teeth from two
historical sites in southern Texas has been brought to my attention by
Mr. D. E. Kilgore of Clarkwood, Texas. Mr. Kilgore obtained a single
hollow canine tooth (Fig. 1) from a site on the Nueces River, about 20
miles inland from the mouth, in Nueces County. This specimen was
shown to Mr. Aalbert Heine, Director of the Corpus Christi Museum,
who referred it to me for examination. My tentative identification of
the West Indian seal (Monachus tropicalis) has been confirmed by
Dr. Richard G. Van Gelder of the American Museum of Natural History. I am indebted to these gentlemen for their kind cooperation and
interest, and particularly to Mr. Kilgore for permission to publish this
note.
The Nueces County locality is referred to by Mr. Kilgore as the
Rancho Diexmero Site and the following historical information was
fumished largely by him. Rancho Diexmero was the headquarters of a
Spanish ranch, the second recorded European habitation in Nueces
County. It was occupied by Europeans in the early 1800's (Bolton,
1910), which is quite early for this part of the country. An excellent
campsite here was probably utilized by Indians prior to the Spanish
occupation. Artifacts are present which match many of those found at
Goliad and at Falcon Dam. The area is now included within an oil
field and the site has been greatly disturbed by bulldozing. Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine whether the tooth came from the
Spanish occupation zone or from an earlier period.
The second locality is the mission Nuestra Senora del Espiritu Santo
de Zuniga (La Bahia) at Goliad. I am indebted again to Mr. Kilgore
for calling this to my attention. At least five hollow canine teeth are

exhibited in the Goliad State Park Museum and while I have not carefully examined these specimens I have no hesitancy about assigning
them to Monachus tropicalis. Both young and adult individuals appear to be represented. No provenience is available for the teeth, but
they are purported to have come from La Bahia and probably date
from the Spanish occupation which began in 1749 (Webb, 1952: 699) .
Monachus tropicalis might be included provisionally in the T exas
fauna on the basis of questionable sight records from the lower Laguna
Madre (Gunter, 1947 ); however, the range as normally outlined does
not include the Texas coast (Hall and Kelson, 1959: 986). It would be
most unwise to assume that the two locality records reported here authenticate the West Indian seal as a former resident of the Texas coast.
In view of the fact that both known Texas records probably date from
a time of Spanish settlement and since only the canine teeth are
present it seems more likely that the teeth were u sed as trade items.
Mammalian canine teeth were frequ ently used as ornaments by
various Indian peoples and the relatively large size of the seal teeth
would be expected to enhance their ornamental value. While M. tropicalis is now rare it was formerly quite common in the West Indies
(Matthiessen , 1959 : 39) and the teeth may have b een exported by
the Spaniards. None of the teeth show evidence of having been bored
for stringing as a n ecklace, but all are broken across the base.
I would like to appeal to archeologists who are working in the coastal
areas of Texas to be on th e alert for additional seal teeth. The hollow
canines m ight easily be mistaken for the more common alligator teeth
and be overlooked in collections. It would be of great interest to obtain
specimens of known provenience antedating the European invasion .
This would clearly establish M. tropicalis as a former member of the
Texas fauna.
