ABSTRACT
In October of 2016, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural
resources survey of the proposed River Ranch County Park project for the
Department of Parks and Recreation, Williamson County, Texas. The work was
conducted in accordance with Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and Texas
Historical Commission (THC) guidelines. The proposed project will involve the
construction of a park entrance, an equestrian center, trails, a day use facility,
driveways and internal infrastructure, camping areas, a park residence, and a
maintenance facility. The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for this project is 1,011
acres of parkland (409 hectares). The survey was conducted in compliance with
Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26) under Permit #7793. Julie Shipp served as
Principal Investigator. Records from this investigation will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Three new archeological sites were recorded during the cultural resources
survey. All three sites were historic and may be interrelated. Site 41WM1356 is
an historic domestic site on the northeast side of the South Fork San Gabriel
River. Site 41WM1357 consisted of three rock walls surrounding the floodplain of
the river. The third site is a structural complex historically known as the River
Ranch (41WM1358), which consists of two domestic structures and numerous
outbuildings dating to the early twentieth century. None of the sites are
recommended as eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or
as a State Antiquities Landmark. However, it is recommended that the rock walls
(41WM1357) be avoided during the development of the park.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
In October of 2016, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural
resources survey of the proposed River Ranch County Park project for the
Department of Parks and Recreation, Williamson County, Texas. The proposed
project will involve the construction of a park entrance, an equestrian center,
trails, a day use facility, driveways and internal infrastructure, camping areas, a
park residence, and a maintenance facility. The Area of Potential Effects (APE)
for this project is 1,011 acres of parkland (409 hectares) (Figures 1 and 2). The
investigation was conducted for compliance with Texas Antiquities Code (TAC),
under TAC Permit No. 7793.
The investigation performed by aci consisted of a background review and an
intensive archaeological survey of the APE. The background review included an
evaluation of the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas to determine if any previously
recorded archaeological sites, historic cemeteries, National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) properties, State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL), or Registered
Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHL) are located within the APE.
Archival research was conducted to determine the ownership history of the APE,
and historic map research was conducted utilizing the Texas Historic Overlay
(THO). Additionally, a review of relevant soils data was performed to aid in
planning the archaeological survey along with the Austin Hybrid District
Potential Archeological Liability Map (HPALM) model (Abbott and Pletka 2015)
which was utilized to identify the areas with the highest probability to contain
archeological sites.
The overall investigation included pedestrian survey, photography, subsurface
testing, site recording, basic archival research, NRHP and SAL eligibility
assessment, data analysis, and report preparation in accordance with Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
standards.

2.0 BACKGROUND REVIEW
2.1 Environmental Setting
The project is located in central Texas along the Edwards Plateau, more
specifically within the Balcones Canyonlands, west of the Balcones Escarpment, a
fault zone with hills to the west and north and low relief to the east and south. In
general, the Edwards Plateau region is characterized by largely dissected
limestone plateaus and hills covered by juniper-oak savanna and mesquite-oak
savanna, containing a sparse network of perennial streams with shallow to
moderately deep soils.
2.2 Soils and Geology
The Balcones Canyonlands form the eroded southern border of the Edwards
Plateau, defined by dissected plateaus and escarpments with stair step
topography. Geographic features include moderate to high gradient streams
with bedrock, cobble, and gravel substrates; inceptisols on gradual to steep
slopes; mollisolls on flat or convex surfaces; and rock outcrops.
There are five soil series mapped within in the APE: Brackett, Denton, Eckrant,
Oakalla, and Sunev soils (NRCS 2016) (Figure 3). Bracket, Denton, and Eckrant
soils are all shallow soils that formed in situ from weathered limestone bedrock
and have a low to moderate probability for containing archeological sites. The
Oakalla soil, mapped along the flood plain of the South Fork San Gabriel River
and the Sunev soil mapped along the terrace of the South Fork San Gabriel River
are both alluvial soils that have a moderate to high potential to contain
archeological sites. These five soil series found within the APE are further
described in below:

Brackett gravelly clay loam, 3 to 12 percent slopes (BkE); Brackett-Rock outcrop-Real
complex, 8 to 30 percent slopes (BkG); Brackett association, 1 to 8 percent slopes
(BkC) – These nearly level to very steep soils are located on backslopes of ridges
on dissected plateaus of the Edwards Plateau. The series consists of shallow to
paralithic bedrock, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from
limestone of Cretaceous age, mainly from the Glen Rose formation.
Denton silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (DnB) – Occurring on uplands, these nearly
level or gently sloping soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent. The Denton
series consist of deep, well-drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey
materials over residuum weathered from limestone bedrock.
Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes (EaD); Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex,
rolling (ErE) – This series consists of soils that are very shallow to shallow to
indurated limestone bedrock and interbedded cryptocrystalline quartz, chert,
marl, and chalk. These well drained soils formed in residuum derived from
limestone. These nearly level to very steep soils are on summits, shoulders, and
backslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus with slopes ranging from 1 to 60
percent.
Oakalla silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, occasionally flooded (Oa); Oakalla
soils, 0 to 1 percent channeled, frequently flooded (Oc) – These soils are on nearly
level to gently sloping flood plains on perennial streams in river valleys. They
are subject to flooding for short periods after heavy rains. The series consists of

soils that are very deep with slopes of 0 to 2 percent. These well drained soils
formed in loamy alluvium derived from limestone of the Cretaceous age.
Sunev silty clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (SuB) – This series consists of very
deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These soils are on nearly
level to moderately steep stream terraces or footslopes of valleys and ridges with
slope ranging from 0 to 15 percent.
The project area encompasses three geologic zones, the diversity of which are
due to the projects location along the San Gabriel River. The Bureau of Economic
Geology (Barnes 1974) classified the general surface geology as primarily
dominated by the Walnut Creek formation (Kwcpbc) which has been further
subdivided to include six members. Three of these members, the Cedar Park, Bee
Cave, and Bull Creek members are found within the project area. The formation
is explained as limestone, argillaceous limestone and marl. Individual members
are 30 to 50 ft thick. Walnut Formation consists of six members that include, from
oldest to youngest, the Bull Creek, Bee Cave, Cedar Park, Whitestone, Keys
Valley, and the upper marl member (Moore 1964).
The northeast portion of the project area, which encompasses the South San
Gabriel River, is designated as Quaternary Terrace (Qt). Barnes describes
Quaternary Terrace deposit as gravel, sand, silt, and clay along streams and
rivers. Mostly above flood level along entrenched streams and rivers. Larger
deposits along San Gabriel River, Berry Creek, and Brushy Creek are as thick as
36 ft and locally may be thicker.
Between the Walnut and Quaternary Terrace regions is the upper Glen Rose
Formation (Kgru). Barnes defines the upper Glen Rose Formation as limestone,
dolomitic limestone, and marl. Shallow subtidal to tidal-flat cycles. Alternating
resistant and recessive beds forming stair-step topography. Marine megafossils
include molluscan steinkerns, rudistids, oysters, and ecllinoids; local dinosaur
tracks. Dolomitic limestones contain water. Corbula interval, commonly one to
three thin beds containing the bivalve, informally divides the lower and upper
Glen Rose Formation.

2.3 Prehistoric Background
The project area falls within the Central Texas archeological region, which has
been subject to continuous human occupation starting around 11,500 years ago.
Although recent research, particularly at the Gault Site (41BL323), is indicating
that there may have been Pre-Clovis occupation in Central Texas (Collins and
Bradley 2008). In a well-regarded synthesis of Central Texas archeology, author
Michael Collins divides the prehistory of Central Texas into three periods: (1)
Paleoindian, (2) Archaic, and (3) Late Prehistoric. Each of these periods is further
divided into subperiods, such as early and late. The dates of each period are
presented below in Table 2 in years before present (BP)

The Paleoindian period dates between approximately 11,500 and 8,800 BP
(Collins 1995:381-3). Early Paleoindian sites identified in Central Texas appear to
be part of a larger regional cultural horizon known as the Clovis horizon. These
early Clovis sites suggest people in Central Texas were participating in a general
hunter-gatherer lifeway based upon the expressions of the camp sites and the
presence of a wide variety of butchered fauna including large herbivores as well
as smaller mammals, and some evidence of local plant consumption. In contrast,
sites identified during the later Paleolithic period exhibit characteristics

associated with a cultural complex referred to as Folsom. Evidence gathered at
Folsom sites indicates a greater reliance upon big game hunting as a primary
means of sustenance. The presence of occasional small burned rock features
toward the end of the Paleoindian period suggests a transitional period of
experimentation leading into the Archaic, an era which is heavily associated with
the presence of heated rock cooking features.
Archaic sites in Central Texas are most often associated with the presence of
hearth and oven features used for preparing food resources, as well as extensive
fire cracked rock middens and scatters. The period as a whole is defined by the
intensified use of local resources, more diverse tool kits, and an overall increase
in the diversity and quantity of material culture found at the sites in comparison
with the Paleoindian period (Collins 1995:383-385).
During the Late Prehistoric the population increased and several new groups of
people appear to have migrated into Central Texas, primarily from the Great
Plains region. The shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric is largely marked
by the introduction of ceramics into the region as well as a further diversification
of tools, including the bow and arrow. Projectile point types generally shift from
Scallorn and Edwards to Perdiz from Early to Late Prehistoric. During the later
period, the movement of Europeans inland from the coast and north from
Mexico marks the end of this period.
2.4 Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the
late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when Spanish explorers traveled
through the region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas.
Captain Alonso De León followed the historic Camino Real from San Antonio to
Bastrop several times during the 1680s, and at least once, traveled on the Camino
de Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and Captain Domingo Ramon, a
Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and camped on the banks of
Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them Arroyo do las
Bendítas Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, the Marques de
Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through presentday Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions. In the mideighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established along the San

Gabriel River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. These missions
were short lived. Faced with drought and increasing devastation from disease,
the Spanish abandoned the enterprise by 1753 and their overall influence in the
region subsequently declined (Odintz 2002).
Anglo-American influence around present day Williamson County began with a
series of land grants from the Mexican government in the late eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries. Local American Indian peoples living in the region
were wary of the new white inhabitants and interactions between the two groups
were frequently violent, prompting Captain John J. Tumlinson and his company
of Texas Rangers to construct a defensive fort and lookout near the headwaters
of Brushy Creek in southwestern Williamson County in 1835. Tumlinson Fort, as
it was called, was abandoned in 1836 when Mexican General Santa Ana invaded
the newly declared Republic of Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several
veterans of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838 Dr. Thomas Kenney
and his family built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson
County. Kenney’s Fort became the first Anglo-American civilian settlement in
Williamson County. However, attacks on the new settlement by local American
Indian peoples were frequent, and numerous settlers, including Kenney, were
killed in these conflicts. By 1846, American Indian populations in the region had
declined significantly as a result of violence and disease spread by the new
settlers and the Anglo-American population rapidly increased. In 1848 the Texas
legislature officially established Williamson County, naming it after Robert
Williamson, a Milam County Judge and state senator.
By 1850, Williamson County had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 enslaved
African Americans. Most of the settlement was concentrated in the eastern part
of the county along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel, but a few families were
living in the western half (Odintz 2002). During the 1850s and 1860s, towns,
lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up around the county. Although
urbanization and industrialization increased somewhat, the bulk of the county
remained rural and agricultural. The majority of the families lived on subsistence
farms in log construction houses. White residents reliance on enslaved African
American laborers increased during this period and agricultural patterns within

the county diversified. Wheat and corn were the predominant commercial grain
crops and cattle and sheep ranching was widespread. Cotton was introduced in
the 1850s, but was not the significant cash crop that it was further east until later
in the century.
As with the rest of the South, the economy of Williamson County declined
during the Civil War, but picked up again in the 1870s with the growth of the
cattle and sheep industry and the expansion of cotton farming. The cattle
industry was sustained by the Chisholm trail, which was established in 1864 and
passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle drives traveled through or originated in
Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s were also marked by the arrival of
railroads to Williamson County (Odintz 2002).
By the early twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry
in importance. The dramatic growth in cotton farming was accompanied by an
increase in farm tenancy. In 1880, 77 percent of the farms were worked by
owners, but this number perceptibly declined through out the late nineteenth
and early twentieth century. By 1930 only 29 percent of the farms were worked
by their owners, instead a class of landless farmers emerged who rented or
sharecropped and land ownership was concentrated among a few (Odintz 2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of
soil depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and boll weevil
infestation. The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation
and encouraged farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton
production was reduced by nearly half, while sorghum and wheat became
important grain crops and cattle, sheep, and poultry farming intensified (Odintz
2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred during the second half of
the twentieth century and a pattern of absentee ownership and non-agricultural
use of the land intensified following World War II. The construction and
expansion of roads throughout undeveloped areas of Williamson County meant
rural populations had easier access to urban centers and vice versa. During this
period, many rural schools were consolidated and some of the local
infrastructure that defined rural communities was abandoned in favor of that in

larger urban centers. For example, the historic Rock House School was one of the
largest schools in Williamson County during the early twentieth century,
boasting a population of 96 students in 1903. The school was consolidated with
Liberty Hill School in 1947, and by the 1990s, the community of Rock House was
largely dispersed.
Suburbanization of portions of Williamson county bordering the city of Austin
caused the population to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the population of
Williamson County was around 37,000 and within twelve years reached over
85,700 (Odintz 2002). During this period, the communities of Georgetown and
Liberty Hill saw rapid growth.
Liberty Hill is the closest community to the project area, located fifteen miles
west of Georgetown and thirty miles northwest of Austin between the north and
south forks of the San Gabriel River. Early settlers arrived in the Liberty Hill area
in the 1840s from the eastern seaboard of the United States and included notable
future community members Taylor Smith, Greenleaf Fisk, and U. H. Anderson.
These initial settlers were joined by the families of Bryson, Poole, and Spencer by
the 1850s. Liberty Hill was first recognized as an official settlement in 1853 with
the establishment of a post office. William Oliver Spencer served as the first
postmaster and is also credited with naming the city. The town center was
relocated twice in response to the post office moving and the founding of the
nearby Bryson Stage Coach Stop, eventually settling in its present-day location
by 1882 (Matthews 2016). Liberty Hill saw an increase in population including a
growing student population due to the chartering of the Liberty Normal and
Business College. The population of Liberty Hill remained generally small,
estimated around 300 in the 1980s, 500 in the 1990s, until reaching its current
population of approximately 1,400 (Matthews 2016).

3.0 BACKGROUND REVIEW OF PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES
Prior to conducting the fieldwork, a background review of the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas was completed (Atlas 2016). The review revealed that
no archeological sites have been previously recorded within the APE, and that no
portions of the APE have been previously surveyed. Only one site, 41WM687,
has been recorded within 0.6 mile (one kilometer) of the APE (Figure 4). Site
41WM687 is a multi-component site with a noted prehistoric lithic scatter and an
historic period scatter. No structures were recorded. The site recorders
postulated that the historic period scatter was likely associated with a former
ranch in the area.

4.0 FIELD METHODS
A pedestrian survey of the entire APE was conducted to locate archeological sites
or other historic properties present within the proposed project area (see Figures
1 and 2). Prior to going in the field the Austin Hybrid District Potential
Archeological Liability Map (HPALM) was consulted to identify portions of the
APE with high, medium, and low probability to contain archeological sites
(Abbott and Pletka 2015) (Figure 5). The high probability areas identified
through the use of HPLAM were shovel tested at 30 meter intervals along a 30
meter transect grid in settings with potential for buried cultural deposits or
where ground surface visibility was less than 30 percent. The medium and low
probability areas were subject to pedestrian survey at 50 and 100 meter intervals,
respectively. Additional shovel tests were excavated within the site boundaries
of the three recorded sites.
The shovel tests measured approximately 30 centimeters in diameter and were
excavated in 10 centimeter levels to the bottom of sterile Holocene age deposits.
The excavated soil was screened and sorted by hand. Shovel test data was
recorded on logs and the locations of the tests were mapped using a GPS unit.
Recording methods included daily journals, photography, the use of task specific
forms for recording shovel tests and photographs, and the use of a handheld
GPS. No artifacts were collected. Three historic sites were mapped,
photographed, and recorded on standard Texas archaeology site forms three site
forms. The site forms and site boundaries were submitted to the Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
In October of 2016, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural
resources survey of the proposed River Ranch County Park project for the
Department of Parks and Recreation, Williamson County, Texas. The APE for the
project includes 1,011 acres of parkland (409 hectares).
The investigation performed by aci consisted of a background review and an
intensive archaeological survey of the entire APE. The overall investigation
included pedestrian survey, photography, subsurface shovel testing, site
recording, basic archival research, NRHP and SAL eligibility assessment, and
report preparation in according with THC and CTA standards.
The vegetation within the APE consisted primarily of young ashe juniper and
oak trees, with mixed grasses. Ground surface visibility was generally good and
ranged from 50 - 70 percent. Naturally occurring limestone bedrock outcrops
were present throughout the APE and in general the soils were shallow and
severely eroded, including the soils within the flood plain. One exception to this
was along the northwest side of an irrigation canal where soils appear to have
suffered less depletion. This area is where the majority of the shovel tests were
excavated. Figure 6 provides the locations of the shovel tests.
The majority of the shovel tests revealed loamy clay deposits down to 30 – 40
centimeters below surface (cmbs) terminating in a zone of gravel. All shovel tests
were negative and no prehistoric artifacts or cultural features were observed
during the pedestrian survey. The absence of chert identified within in the APE
is likely due in large part to a lack of lithic resources and outcrops in the area, as
well as heavy erosion.
Three historic period archeological sites were recorded during the survey:
41WM1356, 41WM1357, and 41WM1358. Also discovered in the project area
were two isolated historic outbuildings, a windmill, and a dump (Figure 7).
Due to the presence of remains of the historic River Ranch within the APE, as
well as the presence of two additional historic period sites, archival research
including a review of relevant property and census records was conducted. The

5.1 Property History
The Project Area includes parcels of land that were historically associated with
three different land grants issued by the Republic of Texas during the years of
Independence, 1836 -1846. These include the Joseph M. Glasscock Survey #254
(1,280 acres), the Henry Fields Survey #233 (1476 acres), and the John Ingram
Survey #335 (320 acres) (Figures 8 and 9).
The early ownership history of the three land grants and their eventual division
into the parcels that currently constitute the Project Area is varied, however, by
the late-nineteenth century it appears likely that all of the land within the Project
Area was held by the Thomas N. Bryson family. As such, the following sections
present the early ownership history of the tracts, followed by a discussion of the
history of the parcels after they were under the ownership of the Bryson family.

The Henry Fields Survey, #233 (1476 acres)
The smallest of the three tracts is a 19-acre parcel located on the east side of the
San Gabriel River that was originally part of a Milam 1st Class Headright issued
to Henry Fields. Fields received the land because of his status as a single white
male over the age of seventeen living in Texas prior to the Declaration of
Independence. Under the new Texas Constitution, white heads of household
occupying the new Republic at the time of Independence were granted one
league and one labor of land (4605.5 acres) and single white men over the age of
seventeen, were offered one-third of a league (1,476.1 acres).

Henry Fields received one-third of a league along the San Gabriel River, but
based on census records does not appear to have ever occupied the land, or lived
in Williamson County (United States Census Records). This was not uncommon,
particularly when the grantee already owned property. Census records only list
one Henry Fields living in Texas in 1850, a resident of Navarro County. In 1860
there are three Henry Fields residing in Texas, but none of them held a
household in Williamson County (United States Census Records, Texas 1850
wand 1860). Interestingly, there was a Henry Fields who served as a private in
the Texan Volunteers and was present at the historic Battle of San Jacinto. The
grant may be associated with this Fields, but he chose to settle in Anderson
County and is buried there (Texas General Land Office 2016).
Apparently, taxes owed on the Henry Fields Survey were not paid in the years
1848 and 1849, and the land was confiscated by the County in 1850. Taylor Smith
purchased the entire Henry Fields survey at public auction for $4.60 (Williamson
County Deed Records, Volume 4, Page 238).
Smith was an early settler in the Liberty Hill area and held multiple properties.
In 1870 he sold 500 acres out of the Henry Fields Survey along the western
boundary, hugging the San Gabriel River to L. N. Collier (Williamson County
Deed Records, Volume 11, Page 618). The 500 acres included the 19 acres parcel
currently located along the eastern side of the Project Area. The land was
maintained by the Collier family, eventually under the ownership of D. H. and
his wife Georgia Collier, until 1887 when the subject 19 acres was parceled out of
the 500-acre tract and sold to Thomas N. and Warren Bryson.
The deed of sale lists the Colliers as residents of Williamson County at this time,
but they do not appear in the 1870 or 1880 Texas Census Records (United States
Census, Texas, 1870, 1880). The Brysons paid $240 for the 19 acres (Williamson
County Deed Records, Volume 44, Page 39). An affidavit issued by the Colliers to
the Brysons concerning previous owners Taylor Smith and his wife Sarah Smith’s
interests in the property states that the couple never resided on the land
(Williamson County Affidavit, Volume 151, Page 65). The Taylors are known to
be earlier settlers in the community of Liberty Hill, but this land was apparently
not their homestead (Handbook of Texas Online, Myreta Julia Matthews 2016).

Thomas N. Bryson, accompanied by his wife Josephine Bryson, relinquished
their interest in the 19 acres property to Warren Bryson in 1907 for $20
(Williamson County Deed Records, Volume 122, Page 456). Warren Bryson
owned the land until 1939 when he sold it to J. H. Williams of Travis County. The
land remained under the ownership of the Williams family until it was acquired
by San Gabriel Holdings and Williamson County, the current owners.
The Joseph M. Glasscock Survey #254 (1,280 acres)
In addition to 1st class Headrights, such as the one Henry Fields received, the
Republic of Texas also issued 2nd, 3rd, and 4th class headrights. All of which
provided land to white males and heads of household and were designed to
encourage settlement.
The largest of the three tracts in the Project Area, a 640 plus/minus acre parcel
constituting the northern section, was initially part of a 1,280-acre Milam 2nd
Class Headright issued to Joseph M. Glasscock. 2nd class headrights were issued
to white men, who immigrated to Texas after the Declaration of Independence.
These land grants included 1,280 acres of land for married white men and 640
acres for single white men who agreed to reside and establish a homestead in
Texas for at least three years.
Joseph M. Glasscock, sometimes referred to as George Glasscock in the official
records, received a 2nd class Headright from the Republic of Texas in 1838 due to
his status as a married white man (Texas General Land Office, Abstract #254).
Glasscock was born in Kentucky around 1809 and was a resident of Texas at the
time of the 1850 and 1860 census. He was a slave holder and lived in Austin
(United States Census Records, Texas 1860). His occupation is listed as contractor
and he held over $150,000 in real estate, a substantial sum during this period.
Because of his status as a contractor residing in Austin with multiple investments
in real estate, it is unlikely he and his family lived on his Williamson County
Headright. However, the property remained in the family for many years and
during this period tenants and/or land managers may have occupied the land.
When Glasscock died, ownership of the Headright was left to his wife Agnes
Glasscock. An agreement issued in 1869 by Agnes and her heirs, as well as a later
Affidavit concerning her death, states that she was remarried to Alfred Britton.

Britton also passed away a few years after their marriage, at which point she
married a man named Billingsley (Williamson County Deed Records, Volume 11,
Page 466). Agnes Billingsley, formerly Agnes Glasscock, sold the subject 640
plus/minus acres within the Project Area to Thomas N. Bryson in 1875 for $320
(Williamson County Deed Records, Volume 16, Page 526).
Thomas N. Bryson retained the property until 1894 when he signed the land over
to his son Warren Bryson and his daughter Maud Crocker. The deed states that
the exchange of property came about as a result of his wife, Nancy Bryson’s
death (sometimes referred to as Nannie in the official records). Bryson also
indicated that at the time of the conveyance he was occupying the land and
refers to the 640 plus/minus acres as his current homestead (Williamson County
Deed Records, Volume 69, Page 285).
In 1916 Maud Crocker, joined by her husband J. B. Crocker, residents of San
Patricio County, sold her interest in the land and all improvements to her brother
Warren Bryson for $1,500 (Williamson County Deed Records, Volume 177, Page
335). Warren Bryson maintained ownership of the property until 1939 when he
sold the land to J. H. Williams of Travis County (Williamson County Deed
Records Volume 296, Page 276). As with the previously discussed 19 acres Henry
Fields parcel, the Williams family maintained ownership of the 640 plus/minus
acres property until it was sold to San Gabriel Holdings and Williamson County,
current owners.
John Ingram Survey #335
The history of the John Ingram survey is complicated and the 320 acres parcel
switches hands rapidly during its early history. The land was originally part of a
military bounty grant issued by the Republic of Texas in 1838 to James
Christopher, assignee of John Ingram, in exchange for military service and an
honorable discharge (Texas General Land Office, Abstract #335). James
Christopher soon after relinquished any interest he held in the property to James
Ingram for a price of $100. The following year, 1839, Ingram sold the land to
Argalus G. Parker. Parker also paid $100. Parker almost immediately sold the 320
acres to G. W. Glasscock for $500 (the handwriting is difficult to read, price may
be incorrect). Glasscock then sold the property for an unrecorded sum to Isaac
Shepard (Texas General Land Office, Abstract #335).

After Isaac Shepard acquired the land in 1839, the 320 acres parcel disappears
from available public records until 1907. In this year, Thomas N. Bryson,
accompanied by his wife Josephine, conveyed the entire 320 acres survey to his
son Warren Bryson. It is unclear how Thomas N. Bryson acquired the land or
how long the Bryson family was in possession of it before it was inherited by
Warren Bryson.
The History of the Tracts following Purchase by the Bryson Family
As described above, it appears that all the parcels constituting the current Project
Area were owned by the Bryson family by the late-nineteenth century. The
Bryson family arrived in Texas in the early 1850s, settling first in Gay Hill in
Washington County and then relocating to Liberty Hill in Williamson County.
John T. Bryson and his wife Amelia Edwards Bryson made the journey by wagon
from the Greenville District of South Carolina with their six children. John and
Amelia settled on what is today known as “Bryson Hill” and donated the land
for the Liberty Hill Cemetery (Bryson Richardson 1975). Thomas N. Bryson, the
son of original settlers John T. and Amelia Bryson, acquired all the parcels of
land constituting the Project Area by the late-nineteenth century. This includes
the 640 plus/minus acre northwestern tract in the Joseph M. Glasscock survey
that Thomas N. Bryson claimed was his homestead and residence in 1894
(Williamson County Deed Records Volume 69, page 285).
Thomas N. Bryson first appears in Texas census records in 1860. At this time, he
was 16 years old and living with his parents John T. Bryson and Amelia Bryson
in Liberty Hill. By 1870 he was the head of his own household along with his
wife Nancy Bryson, and their two young daughters Maud and Effie. Two
boarders also lived with them, Martha Goodlett and Crocket Collier, a local
teacher. Thomas N. Bryson’s occupation was listed as “farmer” but a subsequent
1900 census indicates he was also a “machinist” (United States Census Records,
Texas, 1860, 1880, 1900). Neither John T. Bryson nor his son Thomas N. Bryson
appear in the 1880 census and the majority of Texas census records from 1890
were destroyed by fire.

Thomas N. Bryson’s son, Warren Bryson, acquired all of the subject land within
the Project Area from his father by 1907 and maintained ownership of the parcels
throughout the early twentieth century. Based on census records that place
Thomas N. Bryson near the intersection of Liberty Hill and Leander Road in
1910, it appears likely he continued to live on the property after he gave the land
to his son (United States Census Records, Texas, 1910).
Warren Bryson first appears in Texas census records in 1900. At this time, he and
his wife Margaret were living in Liberty Hill two households away from his
father Thomas N. Bryson. The couple were married in 1892 and had one
daughter, Fay. Bryson’s occupation is listed as farmer in the 1900, 1920, and 1940
census records, but the 1910 and 1930 census indicates he was also employed as a
rural letter carrier.
Members of the Bryson family were in continual possession of the lands from the
late-nineteenth century until 1939. In this year, Warren Bryson sold all of the
acreage within the Project Area to J. H. Williams. William’s paid Bryson and his
wife Margaret Bryson $12,000 for the properties (Williamson County Deed
Records Volume 296, Page 276). The Williams family were primarily residents of
Travis County and eventually sold the property to San Gabriel Holdings and
Williamson County, the current owners. Based on the property records, it is
likely that most of the structures and features identified during the
archaeological survey are associated with Warren Bryson and his wife
Margaret’s occupation, and/or with his parents T. N. Bryson and Josephine
Bryson’s earlier/concurrent occupation.

5.2 Site 41WM1356
Site 41WM1356 is a single component, domestic, historic site located on a terrace
70 meters east of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River (Figure 10). Surface
visibility at the site is low (0 to 20 percent) due to leaf litter from a canopy of
juniper, cedar elm, and live oak trees, and an understory of briar and yaupon.
However, visible components of the site include a depression from a possible
cistern or burn pit, the remains of a brick and limestone chimney, a stone-lined
pathway, a concrete slab, as well as a surface scatter of historic artifacts. A total
of four shovel tests to a depth of 30 cm below surface revealed a lack of
subsurface deposits with an exception of a single positive shovel test within the
depression. Site boundaries were defined by visible surface expressions of the
site, which were approximately 50m north-south by 40m east-west.
A pedestrian survey supplemented by judgmental shovel testing was conducted
within the area of Site 41WM1356. The surface inspection revealed a relatively
low to medium density of historic-age domestic and architectural features and
artifacts concentrated in and around an approximately 6m circular depression. A
scattered concentration of limestone blocks surrounded the depression increased
towards the location of a degraded limestone and brick-lined chimney base. The
remains exhibited a dry stack of rough limestone rocks surrounding a machinemade brick flue (Figure 11). While the exterior dimensions were approximately 3
meters wide, the relative narrowness of the interior suggests the chimney served
a wood–burning stove. North and south of the depression and chimney remains
were two visible portions of a low, limestone curbing, which presumably lined a
walkway. Additionally a small rectangular concrete slab measuring roughly 6m
north-south by 4m east-west was located approximately 15 meters south of the
chimney remains.

burning. While none of these artifacts are temporally sensitive due to long
production periods, the presence of only machine-made brick, and a lack of
possibly earlier dated artifacts most likely indicates that the site is early to midtwentieth century.

Parcel History
Site 41WM1356 is located on the 19-acre parcel on the east side of the South Fork
San Gabriel River that was originally part of a Milam 1st Class Headright issued
to Henry Fields. The parcel at that time was 500 acres, but was parceled out of
that original tract in 1887 when the subject 19 acres was sold to Thomas N. and
Warren Bryson. The Brysons sold this 19 acres to the Williams family, who also
purchased the adjacent land on the west side of the river, where the other two
historic sites were recoded. The Williams’ owned the land until it was purchased
by Willimason County in 2007.
41WM1356 Recommendation
Site 41WM1356 is an historic domestic site in poor condition. Little remains of
the structure or associated artifacts. It is also difficult to associate the site with a
particular activity or event. This site is not recommended as eligible for listing on
the NRHP, or as a SAL.

The site consists of three man-made rock walls (Rock Wall 1-3) for ranching and
farming purposes to help separate landforms and protect livestock from falling
down the terrace or into the river (Figure 14). The walls also may have been
marking territorial boundaries. The walls each consist of the same type of
limestone rock and construction style.
Rock Wall 1 sits in the flood plain of the South San Gabriel River, running
northwest to southeast, beginning at the north parcel boundary in the
northeastern portion of the APE (Figure 13). It is intact for 370 meters before
being washed out by erosion along the South San Gabriel River. A portion of the
original rock wall still stands a further 256 meters to the southeast, continuing to
follow the river. It is most likely the rock wall ran completely down the side of
the river before parts of it were affected by erosion.

Rock Wall 2 (Figure 15) is also located near the northeastern portion of the
Project Area, 400m southwest of Rock Wall 1. Rock Wall 2 runs interrupted for
823 meters, northwest to southeast. It appears to begin in an unnamed
channelized tributary of the South San Gabriel River until ending at a trail road
running through the Project Area. Rock Wall 2 begins at 970 meters above mean
sea level (MLS) and rising to 1025 meters above msl as it crosses a raised terrace,
then back down to 961 meters above msl as it approaches the trail road.

Figure 15: 41WM1357, Rock Wall 2, facing southeast.

Rock Wall 3 (Figure 16) was in the worst condition as it sits right on the edge
atop a terrace. Rock Wall 3 is only 192 meters in length, running north to south,
following the natural shape of the terrace. Most likely Rock Wall 3 was originally
longer, but the ends have washed away or crumbled from erosion.
All rock walls are of the same construction patterns and all roughly run from the
northwest to the southeast. They have all strategically been placed near the river
(Rock Wall 1) or by creeks and along a terrace (Rock Wall 2 and 3). Rock Wall 1
has fallen into the river in some parts as Rock Wall 3 has also crumbled in areas.
Taking into consideration the occupation of the parcels, the rock walls were most
likely created early-mid 20th century.

Parcel History
All three of the rock walls are on the parcel that was initially part of a 1,280-acre
Milam 2nd Class Headright issued to Joseph M. Glasscock in 1838. T.N. Bryson
purchased the 620-acre parcel that is within the APE in 1875. The parcel
remained in the Bryson family and was sold to the Williams family in 1939, and
then finally to Williamson County. The rock walls could be the oldest features
within the APE, perhaps early field markers or livestock fences.
41WM1357 Recommendation
Site 41WM1357 consists of three rock walls that are in poor condition. The walls
are likely associated with ranching activities within the APE, but archival
research does not directly associate them with any particular event or person.
Due to the walls poor condition as well as the lack of association with a known
historic event or person, site 41WM1357 is not recommended as eligible for
listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. However, it is recommended that the walls be
avoided during the development of the park.

5.4 Site 41WM1358, River Ranch Site
The River Ranch Site is an historic farmstead located on a level ridge summit
with bedrock outcropping, overlooking the South Fork San Gabriel River valley.
The site is located in the southwest portion of the APE. There are numerous large
oaks near the home, but the site become more open downhill where the farming
and ranching activities took place. The River Ranch Site consists of thirteen
standing structures: 2 houses, 11 outbuildings (numbered 2-12), along with farm
equipment, and animals pens (Figure 17). The structures are discussed below by
location and as the houses and outbuildings relate to one another, rather than in
numerical order.

Structure Descriptions
House 1
House 1 is a historic, single-family residence located on a ridge top in the main
occupation area of the southern portion of the APE (Figure 18). The National
Folk/Pyramidal Style house exhibits Craftsman Style influences in its one-story,
rectangular floor plan, hipped-pyramidal roof, moderate eave, and exposed
rafters. While the architectural styles apparent in House 1 reflects styles of the
1920s or 1930s, archival research suggests the house was built in 1947 (Appendix
A).

The exterior is clad in white, lapboard siding on the eastern and southern
façades, while portions of the southern façade and the entire western façade have
been replaced with a wider, channeled, horizontal siding. The northern elevation
exhibits a later vertical, synthetic wood siding. The roof is covered in standing
seam metal sheeting, which also skirts the pier and beam foundation.
The front façade contains an integral side porch reached by a series of centrally
placed concrete steps. Double front doors from the southern and western sides of
the porch offer entry to a hall and parlor style floorplan. The porch itself has a
single square column with a simple capital of plain, rectangular molding, and
matching bannister. Any railing is no longer intact. The flooring consists of
tongue in groove planking, and the ceiling is painted bead board.
A single one over one double hung window with wooden sash and casing flanks
both the north side of the central front door, and the eastern most façade.
southern façade contains another one over one double hung window, and two
smaller windows to the rear. A single side door leads from the western most
portion of the southern façade (Figure 19). The rear of the house or the western
elevation contains two banks of symmetrically placed two, one over one, doublehung windows (Figure 20). The northern side of the house exhibits newer
windows of three, two over two, single-hung aluminum encased windows. Most
of the windows, with the exception of the northern side, have exterior screens
hung by storm window fasteners.
The house itself and the materials are in very poor condition, and appear to have
been historically retrofitted for both plumbing and electricity with some more
contemporary repairs.

House 2
House 2 is a historic, single-family residence located on a ridge top in the main
occupation area of the southern portion of the project area. The Pyramidal Style
house exhibits eclectic influences, such as National Folk, Victorian, and Greek
Revival, and it appears to have had two historic additions to the front porch and
rear façade in the same character (Figure 21). The one-story house has a
rectangular hall and parlor floor plan with a colonnaded front porch and hippedpyramidal roof. No eave is present on the north and south façades; however a
moderate eave with exposed rafters is visible along the east and west additions.
According to prevailing architectural styles apparent in House 1, it was likely
constructed in the 1910s. However, the archival research suggests that the house
was built in the early 1930s.

Figure 21: 41WM1358, House 2, oblique view of front and western side of house,
facing northwest.

The exterior is clad in a beveled, vertical, board and batten siding painted in
white, and a relatively wide, plain cornice bands the house with the exception of
the front and rear additions. The roof is covered in standing seam metal
sheeting, which appears to cover an original roofing of wooden shingles.

Aluminum siding encloses the pier and beam foundation of large limestone
blocks.
The front of House 2 contains a full-façade porch supported by four
unelaborated, wooden columns with simple capitals. Two front doors are
flanked by two over two, double hung windows creating a sense of symmetry to
the façade. The overhang of the front porch is exaggerated and hangs noticeably
lower. A discernable seam in roofing as well as the cornice at this juncture likely
indicates the porch was expanded at some point. Indeed the original flooring is
no longer intact, and the limestone steps leading to the porch have been mostly
removed.
The rear of House 2, or the western elevation, has also been modified with the
addition of a slightly sloping shed roof to enclose an additional room to the north
and an integral, side porch to the south (Figure 22). Smooth, limestone rocks
placed in a series of semi-circular steps access the porch. The side porch has a
single turned spindle support, and the remaining balustrade has been enclosed
with more recent plywood. Leading from the porch are two doors, one into the
main house and the other into the addition. The addition itself has a bank of
windows covered by modern plywood coverings, and the northern elevation has
three evenly spaced double hung windows, which were all broken out.
Additional features of House 2 include a small centrally placed chimney within
the southern half. The chimney is constructed of machine-made brick. The
interior of the home does not contain a fireplace, and this chimney likely served a
wood-burning stove.
The house and materials are in very poor condition, and appear to have been
historically retrofitted for both plumbing and electricity with historic additions
and some more contemporary repairs.

pyramidal roof, wood siding, standing seam metal roofing, moderate eaves, and
exposed rafters (Figure 23). However, the wood siding differs in its vertical
board and batten construction. The shed consists of a single room with two doors
located on the eastern and southern façades with what appears to have been a
wooden floor set on piers. Outbuilding 8 likely functioned as storage and is
currently in poor condition.

41WM1358 Recommendation
Based on archival research, the River Ranch Site (41WM1358) appears to be
associated with descendants of the Bryson family, co-founders of Liberty Hill
community. The ranch was in the Bryson family from 1907 until 1939, when it
was sold to the Williams family, who held the property until it was purchased by
Williamson County. The River Ranch site is located on the 320-acre John Ingram
Survey #335 (Appendix A). During its early history the property changed hands
several times and appears to have been owned by various land speculators, with
multiple properties, who probably did not occupy the land themselves. T. N.
Bryson owned the property by 1907 when he sold it to his son Warren Bryson.
The Bryson family owned the ranch until 1939, when it was sold to J. H.
Williams.
Based on the apparent age of the structures and features on the ranch, they are
likely associated with Warren and Margaret Bryson, and/or possibly with
Warren’s father, T.N. Bryson and his wife Josephine. However, the site does
lacks enough association with the founding of Liberty Hill. Furthermore the
structures are all in poor shape. Therefore, site 41WM1358 is not recommended
to be eligible for listing on the NRHP, or as a SAL.
5.5 Isolated Historic Structures
Four isolated historic features were located during the survey that were not
recorded as part of a site. Two outbuildings, a windmill and stock pond, and a
dump were located in the APE. It is possible that these feature are associated
with the other two historic sites that were recorded, but because of distance and
unclear association, these features were recorded as isolated finds.
Outbuilding 1
Outbuilding 1 is an isolated shed located on the side-slope of a mesa in the
southwestern most area of the project area. The roughly square shed is a twopen style and approximately 7m north-south by 8m east-west. The open floor
plan is partially enclosed on three sides and constructed of milled lumber, handhewn cedar posts, reused utility poles, and corrugated metals with an earthen
floor. Visible fastening utilized wire nails and large bolts, washers, and nuts. The

north-south by 13m east-west. The shed is constructed of cedar posts, milled
lumber, and repurposed railroad ties fastened with wire nails (Figure 37). It is
variously sheathed in corrugated metal sheeting, aluminum siding, vertical
boarding, and recycled strips of sheet metal. The pitch of the gabled roof is low
and enclosed on all sides except the south and a central western facing door. The

Windmill
Located on the Project Area is an isolated, historic windmill located on the
northwestern side of the project area (see Figure 9). The windmill is in poor
condition and not completely intact (Figure 38). The tower remains standing;
however the vane and blades have fallen to the ground. Still visible on the
exterior of the vane are the stenciled letters “Aerm(otor) Chic(ago).” The
Aermotor Windmill Company was founded in 1888 and is currently still in
business. The company underwent a few name changes from 1960 to 2006, when
the name was restored to the original company name of The Aermotor
Company. The Chicago-built Aermotor mills were produced between 1916 and
the early 1950’s in the United States, and was a common water pumping model
(Aermotor-Parts 2016). Associated with the windmill was a water well for
pumping and a stock pond that was dry.

Dump
To the west of Rock Wall 1, a dump site was located (see Figure 9). The area was
filled with late-20th century to modern refuse, including a television set, bed
springs, a refrigerator, chicken wire, and metal scraps (Figure 39). The dump
seems to have derived out of opportunity due to its easily accessible location
near the river.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In October of 2016, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural
resources survey of the proposed River Ranch County Park project for the
Department of Parks and Recreation, Williamson County, Texas. The Area of
Potential Effects (APE) for this project is the 1,011 acres of parkland (409
hectares) (Figures 1 and 2). This investigation was conducted for compliance
with Texas Antiquities Code, under TAC Permit No. 7793.
Three new archeological sites were recorded during the cultural resources
survey. All three sites were historic and may be interrelated. Site 41WM1356 is
an historic domestic site on the northeast side of the South Fork San Gabriel
River. Site 41WM1357 consisted of three rock walls surrounding the floodplain of
the river. The third site is the River Ranch site (41WM1358), which consists of
two houses and numerous outbuildings. All of the sites appear to lack the
integrity or association necessary to recommend their listing on the NRHP or as a
SAL. Based on these results, no further archeological work is recommended.
However, it is recommended that the rocks walls (42WM1357) be avoided during
the development of the park.
It must be noted that no level of survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all
cultural features within a project area. Therefore, should previously-unrecorded
cultural resources including human remains be discovered during the course of
construction for this project, the Department of Parks and Recreation of
Williamson County is advised to contact a professional archeologist of any
inadvertent discoveries.
