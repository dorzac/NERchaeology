ABSTRACT
From June 28, 2006 to July 18, 2008, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted periodic
monitoring investigations of an approximately 8300 ft (1.6 miles, ca. 2.5 km) long section of
Vogel Creek in central Harris County, Texas. The objectives of the archeological monitoring
investigations were 1) to confirm or deny through direct archeological field investigations the
presence or absence of significant archeological deposits or features within the present project
area, 2) to adequately document any remains exposed during construction excavation consistent
with the limitations inherent to construction monitoring, and 3) to ensure that significant
archeological deposits were reported immediately to the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission and the Corps of Engineers, Galveston District. The investigations (MAC
PN 05-38) were conducted for the Harris County Flood Control District in order to comply with
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, regulatory requirements for Permit
Application No. 23549. During the 26 month long HCFCD project, a total of 41 archeological
monitoring visits were made to the project area during the various stages of channel excavation
and construction. No evidence of archeological or historic remains was identified during any of
these visits. No further archeological investigations are recommended for this portion of Vogel
Creek. In the event that archeological deposits or features should be encountered during further
construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
side of the creek. The project area follows
Vogel Creek from the north side of the
Arncliff Drive bridge to the confluence of
Vogel Creek and White Oak Bayou located
just south of West Little York Road. The
majority of this area had been the focus of
an intensive pedestrian field survey by
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.
personnel in 2004 (Driver 2005).
A
pedestrian survey of the current project area
in 2004 (Driver 2005) revealed that much of
the project area had been heavily disturbed
by residential construction and previous
stream modifications (Figures 2, 3). The
planned project improvements included
widening and straightening of the channel,
the sculpting of creekbank slopes, and the
placement of various erosion control
elements (e.g., concrete skirts, rip-rap, etc.).

From June 28, 2006 to July 18,
2008, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted
periodic
monitoring
investigations of an approximately 8300 ft
(1.6 miles, ca. 2.5 km) long section of Vogel
Creek in central Harris County, Texas. The
objectives of the archeological monitoring
investigations were 1) to confirm or deny
through
direct
archeological
field
investigations the presence or absence of
significant archeological deposits or features
within the present project area, 2) to
adequately document any remains exposed
during construction excavation consistent
with the limitations inherent to construction
monitoring, and 3) to ensure that significant
archeological deposits were reported
immediately to the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission and the
Corps of Engineers, Galveston District. The
investigations (MAC PN 05-38) were
conducted for the Harris County Flood
Control District in order to comply with
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston
District, regulatory requirements for Permit
Application No. 23549. The investigations
were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 3846.

During the 26 month long HCFCD
project, a total of 41 visits were made to
monitor the various stages of channel
excavation and construction. The field
investigations were conducted by project
archeologists Randy Ferguson and Kelly
Schexnayder, and field technician Darren
Schubert. David Driver served as the
projectâs principal investigator, and would
like to express his thanks to Jackson Lamb
and Richard Aldredge of the HCFCD for
their assistance in the coordination and
scheduling of the archaeological monitoring
efforts.

The project area is depicted on the
Aldine and Houston Heights, Texas 7.5'
USGS topographic quadrangle maps (Figure
1), and consists of a linear property
measuring approximately 1.6 miles in
length, and up to 150 feet (91 m) to each

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
buried sites in areas that were both
accessible and that demonstrated limited
disturbance due to previous residential
development.

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Climate
The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).
Hydrology
The project property is located
along a 1.6 mile long section of Vogel
Creek. The southern end of the tract is
located at the creekâs confluence with
Whiteoak Bayou. Whiteoak Bayou is a
significant tributary of Buffalo Bayou, and
previous archeological investigations along
much of its course have documented
extensive prehistoric occupations. Vogel
Creek is a smaller stream, and no prehistoric
sites have yet been identified along its
banks.

The project area is depicted on sheet
68 of the Soil Survey of Harris County
(Wheeler 1976). The soils include Addicks
loam (Ad), Addicks-Urban land complex
(Ak), and Clodine-Urban land complex
(Ce). Each of these soils is described by
Abbott (2001) as upland loamy ancient (preHolocene) alluvium. Consequently, their
geoarcheological potential is described as
low-moderate (Clodine), and low (Addicks).
A survey by Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
covered a portion of the project area as part
of a larger survey of Whiteoak Bayou
(Fields et al. 1988). Although their work
along Vogel Creek was limited in scope, it
noted disturbance related to previous
modifications and encroaching urbanism
along some portions of the creekbank
(Fields 1988:24). However, based on the
soil descriptions, both the Addicks and
Clodine soils consist of deep loams, a soil
type often found in association with
prehistoric sites within the region (Moore
1996). Consequently, the scope of work
recommended the excavation of several
backhoe trenches to prospect for deeply

Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar

(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)
may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

magnolia
(Magnolia

oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).
Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast

were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials

Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated
economic development of the county, and of
the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a
steady stream of settlers to the region. By
the second decade of the 20th century, the
growing gas and oil industry was competing
with agricultural interests, and helped create
a significant boom in population.

and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.
Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
While archeological research on the
remainder of Vogel Creek has been limited
to the 2004 survey by MAC, a number of
cultural resources studies have been
undertaken within the general study area
around Whiteoak Bayou. Wayne Neyland
was the first to investigate the Whiteoak
Bayou drainage in 1955. Neyland recorded
site 41HR116, which, according to his field
notes on file at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), was eroding
out of the bayou bank over a distance of
about six city blocks. Surface collection and
subsurface probing yielded a possible
hearth, one Gary point, and nine Goose
Creek Plain ceramic sherds (Fields 1988).

The area to be monitored had
previously been the focus of an intensive
pedestrian field survey by Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc. personnel in
2004 (Driver 2005). The survey included
both surface and subsurface (44 shovel tests)
examination, but no archeological sites were
identified. Prior to beginning those field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in the project area located
north of West Little York Road. South of
that road and on the east side of the creek,
was a single previously identified site,
41HR541. First identified in 1986, the site
had been extensively excavated in 1987 (see
summaries of these investigations below).
A revisit to the site in 1996 determined that
no intact portions of the site remained.
Currently, this area is the location of a large
detention basin.

In 1960 and 1961, William Caskey
collected artifacts from 37 prehistoric
localities. Nineteen of these localities can
be associated with eight archeological sites
recorded by TARL. All of Caskeyâs sites
consisted of surface exposures of artifacts
(Fields 1988).
Professional archeologist William
Payne conducted a reconnaissance survey of
Whiteoak Bayou between Cole Creek and
West Road in 1973. He walked the banks of
the bayou and examined the surface in
search of archeological materials. Payne
recorded five of Caskeyâs sites and
recommended sites 41HR239 and 41HR240
for testing due to their archeological value.

excavated 41HR541 in 1987, recovering
Perdiz and Alba arrow points and Goose
Creek ceramics associated with bison bones
(McReynolds et al. 1988). A radiocarbon
date on charcoal associated with the bones
placed the site in the Late Ceramic period,
between 300 to 700 years ago. The low
artifact variability and small number of
recovered artifacts suggested to the
investigators that the site was a limited
activity, single component locale, with the
activity centered on bison processing
(McReynolds et al. 1988:66).

Sites 41HR241, 4HR242, and 41HR 243
were not considered to have potential
research significance (Payne 1973).
William McClure began recording
sites and monitoring the efforts of urban
development along Whiteoak Bayou in
1970.
He was able to relocate sites
originally described by Caskey, as well as to
record 26 previously unknown sites. Most
of McClureâs sites were recorded from
surface deposits of artifacts, usually exposed
by dredging and channel straightening and
widening activities associated with flood
control. McClure discusses the sites in
various issues of the Houston Archeological
Society Newsletter dating from 1975-1982.

In 1987 and 1988, Texas A&M
University excavated 41HR273, the
Alabonson Road site. It contained the
remains of a base camp or place of
aggregation that was occupied primarily
during the Early Ceramic period (1200-1600
years ago), with a superimposed Late
Ceramic occupation (Ensor and Carlson
1991). The recovered artifacts suggested the
occurrence of activities such as biface
manufacture, boiling and roasting, human
interment, and hunting and gathering of
deer, turtle, nuts, and berries. Gary points
dominated the projectile point assemblage,
but Kent, Catahoula, Alba, and Scallorn
were also identified in the upper levels
(Ensor and Carlson 1991).

Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
conducted a comprehensive investigation of
Whiteoak Bayou in 1986 (Fields 1988). The
study was carried out in order to prepare a
synthesis of the archeology of the Whiteoak
Bayou area and to conduct testing at
prehistoric sites that may be affected by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineersâ Upper
White Bayou Flood Damage Reduction
Project.
The effort involved extensive
archival and background research, as well as
a survey of Whiteoak Bayou and a portion
of Vogel Creek, National Register testing
and assessment of nine prehistoric sites,
geoarcheological investigations, and the
analyses of previously collected artifacts
from 46 known sites on Whiteoak Bayou.
Although their work along Vogel Creek was
limited in scope, it noted disturbance related
to previous modifications and encroaching
urbanism along some portions of the
creekbank (Fields 1988:24). Of the sites
tested, only three had substantial intact
deposits.
On Whiteoak Bayou, sites
41HR273 and 41HR541 were deemed
eligible for listing on the National Register.
Another site located along the bayou,
41HR259, was listed on the National
Register, but was found to have limited
potential to yield additional information.
Texas
Archeological

A&M
Research

In 1987, Texas A&M Universityâs
Archeological Research Laboratory also
conducted a survey for proposed detention
ponds to be constructed adjacent to
Whiteoak Bayou (McReynolds 1987).
Thirty-five shovel tests were excavated over
the 170-acre tract. Previously recorded sites
41HR239, 41HR292, and 41HR406 could
not be relocated. The sites were presumed
destroyed by channel straightening and
dredging activities. The survey did result in
the locating and recording of two historic
sites, 41HR610 and 41HR611.
More recently, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc. (MAC) examined 35 acres
at the confluence of Whiteoak Bayou and
Vogel Creek for a proposed detention basin
(Moore and Sanchez 1993). Although no

were
identified.

previously unknown sites were found, the
previously recorded bison kill site noted
above (41HR541) was visited and reevaluated.
It had been completely
excavated, with no undisturbed portions
remaining. The project area had been
modified by historic disturbance, with
evidence of earth-moving activities and
spoil piles containing recent trash.

MAC
conducted
further
investigations along Whiteoak Bayou,
between Cole Creek and West Road, in 2001
(Beck et al. 2002). Within this survey area,
37 archeological sites had previously been
recorded. In an attempt to locate these sites
and to identify additional archeological
deposits, some 365 shovel tests and 24
backhoe trenches were excavated. Due to
the magnitude of the disturbance from
previous channel improvements and the
increasing urbanization of the bayou, a
degradation of site integrity has occurred.
Thus, despite intensive exploratory efforts,
none
of
the
previously
recorded
archeological sites was found.

In 1996, MAC conducted an
intensive pedestrian survey at the proposed
location of a 93-acre detention basin along
the south bank of Whiteoak Bayou, north of
West Little York Road, east of Hollister
Drive (Moore et al. 1996). During the
investigation,
three
prehistoric
sites
(41HR770, 41HR771, and 41HR773) and
one late historic site (41HR772) were
recorded.
The three prehistoric sites
consisted of mounds containing lithic
materials and were tentatively regarded as
eligible
for
nomination
as
State
Archeological Landmarks and to the
National Register of Historic Places due to
their research potential. The historic site, a
former dairy, did not appear to offer
significant research value due to its recent
age.

As noted earlier, a pedestrian survey
of the current project area was conducted by
MAC in 2004 (Driver 2005). The survey
extended along both sides of the creek from
West Little York Road to Arncliff Drive.
The investigations revealed that much of the
project area had been heavily impacted by
residential construction and previous stream
channelization, and that the natural soils
were severely disturbed and partially
removed. No evidence of archeological or
historic remains was identified, and no
further archeological investigations were
recommended.
However, the USACE
reviewer required that monitoring of the
construction project be conducted due to the
high probability nature of the area (email
dated April 7, 2005).

In 1999, MAC conducted an
intensive survey of a proposed 30-acre
detention basin along Whiteoak Bayou, west
of Windfern Road (Beck and Mahoney
1999). No cultural resources were identified
during the investigation.
In 2000, MAC conducted an
additional limited survey at two proposed
detention ponds originally surveyed by
McReynolds in 1987 (Beck 2000). Three
backhoe trenches were excavated to verify
that 41HR239 no longer existed, and 41
shovel tests were placed in portions of the

FIELD METHODS
occurred along both sides of the creek
(Figures 3, 4), and that the extensive nature
of the planned modifications of the creek
had resulted in the demolition and removal
of the residences located within the APE.
Additional disturbances had resulted from
the buried utilities servicing these residential
properties, the landscaping for the Inwood
Forest Country Club golf course located
near the central section of the project area,
and from earlier modifications of the
waterway (including channelizing the creek
and stabilizing portions of its bank with
concrete and rip-rap).

The fieldwork was conducted at
varying intervals between June 28, 2006 and
July 18, 2008, and consisted of periodic
checks of the construction excavations as
they progressed along the creek (Figures 4,
5). A total of 41 monitoring visits were
made over the course of the project (see
Appendix 1 for fieldwork calendar). Efforts
were made to coordinate the visitations with
periods during which excavations were
focused on the upper layers of soils and
sediments (Figures 6, 7), rather than the
large, deep excavations that penetrated into
clearly pre-Holocene deposits (Figures 8, 9).
At times, however, the scale and staged
progress of the construction work was not
conducive to such scheduling, the field visits
focused on post-excavation examinations of
resulting cutbanks and other exposures for
signs of cultural materials or features.
Delays in the construction schedule occurred
on several occasions due to extended periods
of rain as well as for various holidays.
Further, the removal and reconstruction of
several bridges spanning the creek resulted
in extended periods of time when no
excavations were conducted.

The construction work began in
June 2006 at the south end of the project
area, and was initially focused on the section
of the creek from the confluence with White
Oak Bayou to the bridge crossing at Victory
Drive. The second section extended from
Victory Drive to Long Creek lane, and was
begun in January 2007. The third section
covered Long Creek lane to Arncliff Drive,
and was begun in late 2007 (a MAC
computer crash resulted in the loss of the
monitorâs field notes from August 2007 to
January 2008). In general, in the majority of
the project area the initial excavation work
included removal of previous erosion
control features, cutting back the creek bank,
and the removal of all or portions of extant
bridges. The bank excavation portion of this
work involved an extensive degree of
earthmoving, with both sides of the creek
being cut back approximately 20-30 m from
the channel center, and down to a depth of
approximately 3 m below initial grade
(Figures 12, 13). The resulting vertical cut
was usually quite clean, and provided a clear
view of the soil profile for most areas along
the creek. The archeological monitor was
able to identify areas in which soils were
intact and areas where previous truncation
had occurred, as well as identify locations
impacted by residential development-related
disturbances (e.g., utilities, landscape
features, etc.; Figures 14, 15, 16).

The project area is depicted on the
Aldine and Houston Heights, Texas 7.5'
USGS topographic quadrangle maps (Figure
1), and consists of a linear property
measuring approximately 1.6 miles in
length, and up to 150 feet (91 m) to each
side of the creek. The project area follows
Vogel Creek from the north side of the
Arncliff Drive bridge to the confluence of
Vogel Creek and White Oak Bayou located
just south of West Little York Road. The
planned project improvements included
widening and straightening of the channel,
the sculpting of creekbank slopes, and the
placement of various erosion control
elements (e.g., concrete skirts, rip-rap, etc.;
Figures 10, 11).
During the initial survey it was
noted that in the majority of the project area,
widespread residential development had

9

prehistoric or historic cultural materials or
features was identified in any portion of the
project area.

Construction in the project area was
completed in the summer of 2008, and a
final monitoring visit was conducted on July
18, 2008 (Figures 17, 18. No evidence of

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston
District, regulatory requirements for Permit
Application No. 23549. The investigations
were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 3846.

From June 28, 2006 to July 18,
2008, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted
periodic
monitoring
investigations of an approximately 8300 ft
(1.6 miles, ca. 2.5 km) long section of Vogel
Creek in central Harris County, Texas. The
objectives of the archeological monitoring
investigations were 1) to confirm or deny
through
direct
archeological
field
investigations the presence or absence of
significant archeological deposits or features
within the present project area, 2) to
adequately document any remains exposed
during construction excavation consistent
with the limitations inherent to construction
monitoring, and 3) to ensure that significant
archeological deposits were reported
immediately to the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission and the
Corps of Engineers, Galveston District. The
investigations (MAC PN 05-38) were
conducted for the Harris County Flood
Control District in order to comply with

During the 26 month long HCFCD
project, a total of 41 archeological
monitoring visits were made to the project
area during the various stages of channel
excavation and construction. No evidence
of archeological or historic remains was
identified during any of these visits. No
further archeological investigations are
recommended for this portion of Vogel
Creek. In the event that archeological
deposits or features should be encountered
during further construction, work should
cease in the immediate vicinity and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission
contacted
for
further
consultation.

APPENDIX 1
Archeological Monitoring Daily Field Notes
6-28-2006 Randy Ferguson
Today is the first day of monitoring at Vogel Creek. It looks as if the work on the creek has
progressed from the confluence of Vogel Creek and White Oak Bayou in the south to a point
north of Little York Rd. approximately at UTM NAD27 261739E 3306239N.
The work south of Little York Rd consists of grading of the banks and this work appears for the
most part complete in this area. There is a large spoil pile on the right bank of Vogel Creek. I
searched the bank and found no sign of cultural material.
The area to the north of Little York Rd. is in current excavation. The right bank of Vogel Creek
is being worked on at this time. The left bank has already been done. The workmen are in the
process of digging the drainage back 20-30m from the main channel to a depth of roughly 3m.
They are leaving a fairly straight up and down cut wall at the terminus of the digging, so it is
really convenient for observing the profile. At the terminus of the digging there appears to be a
layer of fairly shallow fill atop an intact soil profile. The upper layer of the intact soil is
definitely truncated throughout but there appears to be a good deal of it still intact. No historic or
prehistoric artifacts were noticed in this cut wall or on the adjacent ground surface. There were a
couple of intrusive features that appear to be either utility related or modern residential
excavations of some sort as there were no artifacts present.
7-6-2006
The work on Vogel Creek has proceeded north on the right bank some 150 meters to NAD27
261775E 3306393N. The work has followed the same similar pattern of taking out the right bank
some 20 to 30 meters from the main channel. There is a large section just north of last weekâs
stopping point in which they did not take it back as far. The profile is virtually the same. There
were a few historic intrusions into the natural in this stretch but I did not see any artifacts that
looked old. There was some sheetrock and modern garden pot fragments in the fill. No
significant historic and no prehistoric sites or artifacts were observed or recovered.
7-17-2006
The work on Vogel Creek has proceeded northward to Victory Rd on the right bank of the creek.
The work switched banks to the left bank on the north side of Victory Rd. Today the work had
proceeded to map datum NAD 27 261428E 3306765N.
The methodology of work being done has not changed thus far. The workmen are still expanding
the bank of the creek from 20-30 meters further back. The edge of the work terminates in a cut
bank/profile wall of roughly 3-meters in height. The only anomaly noticed today was a possible
filled creek channel north of victory rd that shows up fairly well in the profile. In looking at the
1930-1940s topographic maps, there seems to be a major fork in the old drainage in this area.
The feature in the wall is probably this old drainage as there is fill on the inside of the feature.
No historic or prehistoric artifacts or sites were observed in this stretch.
7-30-2006
Today it did not appear that the construction crew had made any northward progress from the last
visit 13 days ago. I went ahead and looked at the spoil piles where they were stopped at. That is
the area on the left bank of Vogel Creek just north of Victory Rd. There was plenty of modern

24

historic debris within the spoil piles and disturbed areas but nothing that appeared definitively old
historic or pre historic.
8-14-2006
There has not been much linear progress on the creek since I was here last. But the workmen are
doing other things. There appears to be some excavation for a new bridge at Maple Tree Rd. and
Cypress Grove Rd. where they cross Vogel Creek. There did not appear to be any buried sites at
either of these two locations. There was also work being done at the confluence of Vogel Creek
and White Oak Bayou. This work consists of deep excavations and forming for the concrete
skirts that will cover the drainage slope. Again, no features were observed in this area.
8-21-2005
The workmen are still concentrating on the stretch of creek between Little York and Victory
roads. They have not disturbed any new ground in these sections but have torn down the concrete
storm drains and begun reconstructing the alignment with fill.
The only other place where work is occurring is at the Maple Tree Street bridge crossing. This
work had begun on my last trip and has been somewhat expanded since. I located a laid brick
feature that was disturbed by the excavations at the bridge crossing. The feature is on the right
bank of Vogel Creek north of Maple Tree St., 17 meters west of the creek bank. There is 30
centimeters of fill atop the feature. This fill contains construction rubble. The bricks appear to be
dry laid in a single layer reminiscent of a sidewalk or patio. The bricks are high fired and of a
pale brown color. There is 8-centimeters of fill under the brick. This fill includes glass, nails and
a lot of oyster shell. The natural soil begins 8 centimeters under the brick layer and is a very dark
grayish brown clay loam. None of the artifacts around the feature appear to be very old. The
brick is very hard and of a modern, molded style. There are also modern glass fragments and
round nails in and around the feature.
8-27-2006
The workmen have still been stifled by rain. They have worked some more on the bridge
replacement at Maple Tree Rd. but there appeared to be little other new ground disturbance.
9-14-2006
Today, I talked to one of the superintendents who told me that they have only worked 17 days in
the last 2 months due to rain. He also said that they had to have the stretch of the creek from
White Oak Bayou to just north of Victory Rd. totally complete before they could move on. So at
this point they are concentrating on finishing this stretch of the job. This includes mostly sloping
and grading what has already been disturbed, although there will be some more ground
disturbance. The superintendent said that the bridge at Little York Rd. would be removed for this
phase of the work. I could not see that there were any signs of archeological material in any of
the areas worked since the last time I was here.
10-9-2006
The bridge crossing Vogel Creek at Little York Rd. was down this time. The stretch of the creek
from White Oak Bayou to about 150 m north of Little York Rd is very near completion. The
sides of the drainage have been profiled and locking block has been installed in trouble spots. I
walked this stretch since they disturbed some more ground while sloping the bank. No cultural
material was found.

25

The section from 150 m north of Little York Rd. to Victory Dr. has had a deep gouge cut in the
centerline of the creek, down into the basal clay. I walked this section of new disturbance also
and found no cultural materials.
11-6-2006
Today, it looks like work is continuing on the area from the confluence of Vogel Creek and White
Oak Bayou to the bridge crossing at Victory Dr. The area south of Little York Rd has had
extensive block and concrete laid but it does not look like any new ground disturbance has
occurred. The area around Victory road has had some new disturbance. From 40 m south of
Victory Rd. to 100 m north on the right bank of Vogel Creek they have made a fresh cut. I
walked and photographed this stretch and did not see any features or artifacts. The bridge at
Maple Tree Ln. is being constructed but there was no apparent new ground disturbance. No other
areas are being impacted at the present time.
11-24-2006
It seems as if work has continued mainly on the section between White Oak Bayou and Victory
Rd, they are digging footings for the Little York Rd. bridge. They seem to be just pushing dirt
around for the most part between Little York and Victory roads. The area that had been freshly
dug out under Victory Road bridge last time now has a vertical concrete retaining wall. The area
between Little York and White Oak Bayou is now almost completely concrete.
The bridge at Maple Tree St. is now spanned across the gap but they still have to pour the surface.
There is an area on the corner of streamside and Long Creek roads, just east of Vogel Creek and
north of Maple Tree St., where they have excavated and put in a 6â-8â diameter concrete pipe.
No sites or features were discovered in the new disturbances areas during this visit.
12-12-2006
The area between White Oak Bayou and Victory Rd. is being further refined and finished. The
only new ground disturbance in the area is from re-channeling the flow of water, which is
occurring in the basal clay. The construction of the bridge over Maple Tree Ln. continues with
no new ground disturbance. No sites or features were discovered in the new disturbances areas
during this visit.
12-26-2006
Basically there has been no apparent new ground disturbance in the project area since my last
visit. There has been a lot of rain and the holidays.
12-2-2006
Again, no new ground breaking activity has occurred. It appears that work is continuing in the
finishing stages between White Oak Bayou and Victory Rd.
1-12-2007
Today, the crews have finally commenced the work on the drainage north of where they had been
stopped for so long. About 150 m north of Victory Dr., where previous northward progress had
been halted, the workman have begun cutting trees and scraping and contouring the banks of the
creek. Darren and I walked the edges of the new disturbance, which amounted to maybe 100 m
on each side of the drainage north of a small foot/golf cart bridge where work had previously
halted. It appears, at this time, the workmen are cutting the trees along the edges of the drainage
and scraping and contouring the banks of the bayou. They are disturbing no more than about 2030 m of ground in from the waters edge. They are disturbing less than 30 cm depth of soil in the

26

process. I donât know if this is the extent of the work that will occur in the golf course area or if
they plan to do more channel widening here also. We will have to wait and see. No
archeological sites or artifacts were discovered on this new stretch of disturbance, unless you
count golf balls as artifacts.
2-21-2007
The area south of Little York Rd. is finished with new grass growing on the sides. The bridge
over Little York Rd. is still being constructed. The stretch between Little York Rd. and Victory
Dr. is in the finishing stages. There is a section on the south side of Victory Dr. on the left bank
of the creek stretching southward for about 300 m that has some new disturbance. It is in the
finishing stages of work and I saw no indications of sites when walking this stretch. Work has
proceeded northward from Victory Dr. to Maple Tree Ln. in spots. This is a 200-300 m stretch in
which they are cutting the bank down fairly deep on one side similar to how they did in the more
southerly sections. I walked this stretch of new disturbance and found no indications of sites.
The bridge over Maple Tree Ln. is nearing completion, north of which there has been no new
disturbance.
3-7-2007
Between Little York Road and Victory Drive, they are installing riprap, so this section is nearing
completion. Between Victory Dr. and Maple Tree Lane, the contouring of the bayou continues. I
walked the freshly disturbed areas in this section and found no sites or artifacts. The bridge over
Maple Tree Lane is finished but not open yet. The stretch north of Maple Tree Lane is still in
original condition.
3-14-2007
No new ground disturbance has occurred this week other than a small cut across a side drainage
of Vogel Creek, just north of Maple Tree Dr. No archeological sites or artifacts were discovered
today.
4-2-2007
No new ground disturbance has occurred this week. There has been lots of rain so the progress
has been slow. The bridge over Maple Tree Dr. has been completed and is open to traffic. No
archeological sites or artifacts were discovered today.
4-16-2007
Today the disturbance has progressed around and north of Maple Tree Dr. They are beginning to
shave the sides in a few areas in this stretch on the left bank of Vogel Creek. It appears that they
will be doing the same thing as before. That is cutting away one side of the bank while leaving
the other. Kelly and I walked these areas of new disturbance and did not notice any archeological
sites or artifacts.
8-01-2007 Kelly Schexnayder takes over the project.
Work between Victory and Maple Tree Drive currently underway. Hauling away push piles that
have been sitting around as well as continuing with the laying of pavers. No other work currently
in progress. No pics.

Noted new stacks of culverts along the upstream waiting for installation. Appears that there was
some moving of dirt but in an already disturbed area. No work currently happening at Arncliffe
Rd., only the ongoing bridge reconstruction at Long Creek Lane. No pics.
2-15-2008
Pushpiles at Arncliffe Rd. are overgrown. Rerouting still in place with no new work having been
done in this area since the gradation of the soil within the last few months. There are no new
intact soils. Currently still working north of Long Creek Ln., scraping the soil below and into
Beaumont clay on the east and laying pavers on the west bank. (pics #130-135)
2-29-2008
Upstream at Arncliffe Rd. the banks are currently being graded in preparation for concrete
pouring and the laying of pavers. All soils except for one area have already been disturbed by
past grading. The one area noted is ~ 200 m north on Arncliffe Rd. on the west bank along a
residential fence. All soils were observed and no cultural materials noted. Culverts mentioned on
1/25/08 have been installed. (pics #136-138)
3-30-2008
Bridge at Arncliffe Rd. has been taken out and the east bank has been cut back and truncated,
allowing for a fresh look at an undisturbed stratum beneath push piles. This bank was examined
and no cultural remains were noted. (pics #139-143)
4-09-2008
New work underway north of Arncliffe Rd. Grading process had begun prior to todayâs visit and
freshly turned soils as well as truncated banks were exposed. Pavers recently lain on the east
bank south of the bridge (still down). All new soils were examined.
(pics #144-147)
4-17-2008
Work continues north of Arncliffe Rd. Culverts have been put in (see photo #148) and the
grading process continues. No work currently occurring south of bridge. Long Creek Ln. now
open. (pics #148-149).
