Abstract
Between March 16, and July 19, 2015, Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins) conducted a Phase I
cultural resources survey of rerouted sections of the proposed Cross Valley Pipeline Project (Project)
on behalf of the City of Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB). This investigation provides a basis
to identify and assess cultural resources that could be impacted by construction of the proposed
undertaking in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of
Texas.

The overall project consists of 87.71 kilometers (km) (54.5 miles) of new 61-centimeter (cm)
(24-inch) natural gas pipeline located in Cameron and Hidalgo Counties, Texas. The Area of Potential
Effects (APE) for the current survey involved rerouted sections totaling 16.19 km (10.06 miles) was
conducted within a corridor that measured approximately 27.43 meters (m) (90 feet [ft]) wide, and
included the examination of five separate areas, encompassing approximately 38.23 hectares
(94.47 acres). The depth of impact is estimated at 2.44 m (8 ft) throughout with deeper impacts of
up to 6.1 m (20 ft) at boring pits associated with horizontal directional drilling. BPUB is a political
subdivision of the state, and the utility easement would be publicly owned and/or controlled lands;
therefore, compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code is required, and work was conducted under
Antiquities Code Permit No. 7208. A total of 37 person days were associated with the fieldwork.

The background review revealed that the APE has not been previously surveyed, and that no
previously recorded cultural resources are within a 1-km (0.62-mile) radius of the rerouted sections.
The survey resulted in one newly recorded site (41CF223) and two isolated finds (IF). Site 41CF223
is a severely disturbed, prehistoric campsite with scattered burned clay balls mainly on the surface.
Repeated disturbances caused by long-term agriculture production has impacted the site to a
considerable degree, and it is unlikely any significant data could be recovered from a subsurface
context. Consequently, site 41CF223 is not recommended eligible for inclusion to the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), and no
further work is recommended.

During the field survey, no cultural material besides burned clay balls associated with site 41CF223,
historic ceramic from IF 1, chipped glass from IF 2, and modern trash were encountered on the
surface or in 108 shovel tests and 6 backhoe trenches that were excavated within the APE. Of these
cultural materials, only a representative sample of the burned clay balls and the historic ceramic
were collected. In accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, Atkins has made a
reasonable and good faith effort to identify archaeological historic properties within the APE. As no
properties were identified that meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or
for designation as an SAL according to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26.12, Atkins recommends no
further work. Finally, nondiagnostic artifacts collected will be discarded pending Texas Historical

I. INTRODUCTION
Between March 16 and July 19, 2015, Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins) conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey for rerouted sections of the proposed Cross Valley Pipeline Project on
behalf of the City of Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB). The project involves construction of
87.71 kilometers (km) (54.5 miles) of new 61-centimeter (cm) (24-inch) natural gas pipeline in
Cameron and Hidalgo Counties, Texas (Figure 1). The overall project was surveyed by Burden et al.
(2014a), and begins near Brush Line Road 8 km (5 miles) east of Faysville and continues in an eastsoutheast direction to its termination near the intersection of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 511 and
Old Alice Road in Brownsville, Texas. The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for the current survey
involved rerouted sections totaling 16.19 km (10.06 miles). The survey corridor measured
approximately 27.43 meters (m) (90 feet [ft]) wide, and included the examination of five separate
areas, encompassing approximately 38.23 hectares (ha) (94.47 acres). The depth of impact is
estimated at 2.44 m (8 ft) throughout with deeper impacts of up to 6.1 m (20 ft) at boring pits
associated with horizontal directional drilling (HDD).

BPUB is a political subdivision of the state, and the utility easement would become publicly owned
and/or controlled lands; therefore, compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code is required, and work
was conducted under Antiquities Code Permit No. 7208. This investigation was also performed in
compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (PL 89-665) and in
accordance with the Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) 800), the Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas Administrative Code
[TAC], Title 13, Chapter 26), and guidelines set forth by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and
the Register of Professional Archaeologists (RPA).

Three of the rerouted sections will cross irrigation canals. At each crossing, the proposed pipeline
would be installed by HDD. The proposed project HDD locations on opposing sides of irrigation canals
were trenched, while shovel testing was conducted throughout the remainder of the APE.

The objectives of the survey were to (1) locate cultural resource sites (both archaeological and
standing structures), if any, within the survey corridor; (2) delineate the vertical and horizontal
extent of any identified sites; (3) assess site integrity; and (4) provide a preliminary evaluation of
each identified siteâs potential eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
and/or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).

This report is divided into seven sections and two appendices. Following this introduction, Sections
II and III discusses the general environmental setting and cultural background information pertinent
to the project. Section IV is a summary of the purpose of the investigations and the methods used for
the literature and records review and for conducting the fieldwork. Section V summarizes the results
of the investigation. Section VI provides conclusions and recommendations. Section VII lists

II. GENERAL ENVIRONMENT SETTING
This section provides an overview of the natural environment surrounding the proposed reroute
sections of the Cross Valley Pipeline Project. Specific relevant information for such an overview
consists of the regionâs geology, soils, and terrestrial resources (flora and fauna). Characteristics of
the natural environment that affect the nature and preservation of cultural resources are also noted.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The project area lies within the Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain portion of the Western Gulf
Coastal Plain ecoregion in Hidalgo and Cameron Counties (Griffith et al. 2004). The Western Gulf
Coast Plain maintains a relatively flat topography with predominantly grassland vegetation adjacent
to the coast. Moving inland, the regionâs plains are older, more irregular, and have mostly forest or
savanna-type vegetation. In addition, portions of the project area are located at the southern end of
the Gulf Prairies and Marshes Vegetative Area of Texas and contains vegetation native to the South
Texas Plains (Gould 1975).

The Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain portion of the ecoregion predominantly consists of
Holocene-aged alluvial sands and clays of the Rio Grande. Historically, the floodplain ridges once had
abundant palm trees, and early Spanish explorers called the river âRio de las Palmasâ (Griffith et al.
2004). However, most large palm trees and floodplain forests had been cleared by the early 1900s.
Currently, the region is dominated by cropland with rice, grain sorghum, cotton, and soybeans as the
principal crops. In addition, urban and industrial land uses have expanded greatly in recent decades,
and oil and gas production is common. Channels for irrigation and urban use have mostly diverted
the waters of the Rio Grande with little or no flow reaching the Gulf of Mexico.
Elevations throughout the region range from sea level to approximately 30 m (100 ft) above mean
sea level. Average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 89 cm (16 to 35 inches), occurring mostly
in the spring and fall. Summers are often characterized by drought conditions that are frequently of
sufficient duration to depress crop growth.

GEOLOGY

The current Lower Rio Grande Valley is a mix of riverbank, shore, marsh, and lake settings with the
amalgamation of silty and sandy flat floodplain giving rise to shifting stream channels. This system
of altered steam channels results in the resacas and oxbows and meandering scars that are
found throughout the region. These structures are perpetually affected by wind-borne sediments
(Butzer 1982).

Since the last glacial maximum (ca. 20,000 B.P.), the river valley has changed dramatically. Ocean
levels had risen approximately 100 m causing the course of the Rio Grande to shorten with the
influx of the rising sea water, which caused an increase in valley aggregation (Brown et al. 1980).
100033612/150039

II. General Environment Setting
After the last glacial maximum by the middle of the Holocene, the Rio Grande was depositing
alluvial soils and ultimately flooding the valley several times (Boyd et al. 1994). These flooding
episodes created an estuarine environment (Brown et al. 1980). The filling of the valley ceased
between 10,000 and 7000 B.P., resulting in additional soil aggregation manifested as prograding
delta lobes over earlier Holocene deposits. Sea level reached its present level at around 3000 B.P.,
and due to the rising water, the lobes were reworked, eroded away, and redeposited.

The geology of the Lower Rio Grande Valley consists of Holocene (>10,000 years), Pleistocene
(10,000â2 million years [my]), and Pliocene (12.5â4.5 my) fluvial and deltaic deposits (Brown et al.
1980). Multiple high, level Pleistocene terraces border the Holocene floodplain and delta complex.
These terraces were formed by fluvial-deltaic deposition during maximum sea level periods and
under glacial minimum conditions during the middle to late Pleistocene (Paine 2000). Overlying the
terraces are extensive windblown deposits of sand and clay dunes, interspersed with sand sheets
and localized wind deflation areas. Holocene stabilized sand dunes occur as broad, segmented
expanses of northwestward-trending eolian deposits (Mallouf et al. 1977:9â10). These deposits
usually have a height of 1 to 9 m. The surface relief of the stabilized sand dunes is typically undulating
with occasional eolian depressions of varying size and shape (Mallouf et al. 1977:9â10). Because of
the active nature of these windblown deposits, archaeological sites may be repeatedly buried and
eroded. In addition, the depressions that can occur in them possess the capability of retaining
water for a limited time after rains and, given the importance of water in the arid landscape, would
have been attractive to prehistoric animals and people.

The oldest bedrock deposit within the project area is the Pliocene epoch Goliad Formation (12.5â
4.5 my). It is exposed in eastern Hidalgo County and manifested as fluvial deposits composed of clay,
sand, sandstone, caliche, chert, limestone, and dark siliceous granules and pebbles in a caliche matrix
(Brown et al. 1980). During the early Pliocene, the depositâs environment was under heavy erosional
stress in its river valleys causing irregular bedding, and presence of gravel and caliche (Hosman
1996). This formation is the source of much of the locally obtained raw materials used for prehistoric
stone tools within the region (Bousman et al. 1990).

The Lissie Formation overlays the eastern edge of the Goliad Formation as an unconformity in
eastern Hidalgo County. The formation was deposited during the Oligocene into the middle
Pleistocene and ended at 14,000 B.P. and included at least 14 continental glacial advances
interspersed by warmer periods (Day et al. 1981). The Lissie Formation consists of gray to brown
to pale yellow clay, silt, sand, siliceous gravel, and sandy caliche. Pockets of stabilized sand
dune deposits characterized by dense live oak copses and scrub vegetation occur within the
formation (Brown et al. 1980).
Within eastern Hidalgo County and northwestern Cameron County is the Beaumont Formation of
the Late Pleistocene, which is exposed as matrices of clay, silt, sand, and gravel to a depth to 270 m.
The sediments composing the Beaumont Formation were primarily deposited by rivers and include
100033612/150039

II. General Environment Setting
natural levees and deltas that coalesced through shifting of the river mouths as they reached the
coast. The marine element of the formation is much less pronounced and includes marine and
lagoonal waters in the embayments between the stream ridges and delta plains (Sellards et al.
1966). Archaeologically, the age of these deposits precludes the presence of deeply buried sites, but
may contain megafaunal remains.

SOILS

The soils of eight soil series have been mapped within the survey corridor from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) soil maps of the area (Table 1) (Natural Resources Conservation Service
[NRCS], USDA 2015). These soils can be grouped into three soil orders: Vertisols, Mollisols, and
Inceptisols. Soils in the project vicinity date from the Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Holocene; the age of
the soils roughly correlates with their position relative to the Arroyo Colorado. In general, soils north
of the Arroyo Colorado are Pliocene and Pleistocene in age, although there are some Holocene-aged
soils within the floodplain north of the Arroyo Colorado. South of this waterbody, the soils are
Holocene in age (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976) and could have the potential to harbor
archaeological deposits.

TERRESTRIAL RESOURCES
The native flora of the Lower Rio Grande Valley is a mixture of elements from diverse geographic
origins (Correll and Johnston 1970; Gould 1975). Blair (1950) includes south Texas and adjacent
northern Tamaulipas in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province. Thorny brush is the dominant vegetation in
this province. Because of more luxuriant growth in Cameron, Starr, Willacy, and Hidalgo Counties,
Blair (1950) separates this area from the rest of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province by calling it the
Matamoran District. The immediate project area is principally a mixture of coastal prairie grasslands,
thorn-scrub and cultivated fields. Plant species that occur in the area include black mangrove
(Avicennia germinans), buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides), curly mesquite (Hilaria belangeri),
100033612/150039

II. General Environment Setting
saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima), sumpweed (Iva annua), mesquite, yucca, and prickly pear cactus
(Hatch et al. 1990).

Extreme southern Texas has a very diverse faunal assemblage. Wildlife typical of the Tamaulipan
Biotic Province includes many species of the Neotropical, Texan, and Kansan Biotic provinces and a
few species common to the Austroriparian and Chihuahuan provinces (Blair 1950). Animals common
in the region are Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), longtailed weasel (Mustela frenata), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), hog-nosed
skunk (Conepatus chinga), coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus
californicus), cottontail, javelina, and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (Davis and Schmidly
1994). Thirty-six species of snakes and numerous species of rodents also live in the area (Blair 1950).

III. CULTURAL SETTING
This section presents information concerning the cultural setting of the proposed project area by
providing a chronological summary of human occupation in the region. The chapter summarizes the
prehistoric setting and different prehistoric and historic time periods followed by a brief description
of the results of the review of previous archaeological investigations and recorded sites within
0.5 mile (0.8 km) of the project location.

PREHISTORIC PERIODS

Paleoindian Period (11,500â8000 B.P.)
The Paleoindian period in South Texas is recognized by the presence of projectile points such as
Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura. These points coupled with spears
aided in the pursuit of large game animals. Although intact deposits containing evidence of
Paleoindian occupations are unknown in South Texas, evidence from sites in adjacent regions
suggests the period was characterized by low population density, small bands, and large territorial
ranges of nomadic groups that subsisted by hunting Late Pleistocene megafauna. During this period,
great expanses of land were inundated by the rising sea levels. Temperatures may have been
10â15.4 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than today (Bousman et al. 1990:94).

The scant evidence of Paleoindian occupations in the South Texas region includes Clovis points found
at archaeological sites in Wilson, Dimmit, and Atascosa Counties as well as at the Southern Island site
on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande at Falcon Reservoir (Hester 2004). Folsom artifacts have been
found on the Rio Grande Plain, such as preforms and failures in Webb County and near Falcon
reservoir, and isolated finds such as a Folsom projectile point base recovered from 41CF54 near
Laguna Atascosa in Cameron County (Terneny 2005). However, no Folsom camp or kill sites have
been found in the region (Hester 2004). Later Paleoindian projectile points have been recovered
mostly from the northern extent of the region, such as Golondrina, Plainview, Angostura, and
Scottsbluff types from Uvalde, Bexar, Victoria, and Williamson Counties (Terneny 2005). Noted
Paleoindian sites in the South Texas Archeological Region include Berger Bluff (41GD30) in Goliad
County, 41WY140 in Willacy County, and the Johnston-Heller (41VT15), J2 Ranch (41VT6), and
Willeke (41VT16) sites in Victoria County.

Archaic Period (8000â1200 B.P.)

The Archaic period witnessed a shift to an exploitation of a wider range of plant and animal species,
coupled with a decrease in mobility that was probably associated with climate change. Perennial
steams existed in some areas of the local draws, but extensive freshwater ponds producing
diatomaceous muds also began to appear where discharge declined. Water in the lakes and ponds
fluctuated, sometimes completely drying up. By the end of the period, many of the streams ceased
100033612/150039

8

III. Cultural Setting
to flow and the diatomite lakes evolved into muddy marshes. The transition from flowing water to
standing water represents a dramatic hydrologic change in the area. The widespread decrease in
water was the result of decrease in regional effective precipitation from the late Pleistocene to the
early Holocene. This decrease affected both runoff and spring discharge. Paleontological data
(Graham 1987; Johnson 1986) document this environmental change as well as sedimentologic and
stratigraphic information (Holliday 1995), which caused streams that formerly flowed year-round
to dry up.

Such a drastic, though perhaps gradual, loss of primary food sources exploited in the Paleoindian
period would have caused considerable cultural stress. It was probably this stress that caused a
shift of attention to previously unexploited plants and animals. Throughout the Americas, the
Archaic was a time of increasing technological (and probably social) complexity. Toolkits become
larger, and through time the many regional differences slowly coalesced into more-homogenous
forms. This includes an emphasis on the exploitation of marine resources in coastal zones (Terneny
2005). The Archaic period is often divided into the Early, Middle, and Late periods with additional
divisions such as complexes and horizons attributed to the Archaic throughout the region. These
include the Repelo (4000â2000 B.P.) and Abasolo (4000â2000 B.P.) complexes identified by
MacNeish (1947) and the early corner-notched horizon (circa 8000â5500 B.P.) and the early basalnotched horizon (circa 5600â4500 B.P.) outlined by Hester (2004a). However, overall the period
is also poorly understood in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and sites dating to this time, especially
Early and Middle Archaic sites, are rarely encountered and are limited to surface finds. Late Archaic
sites are more common, but are often mixed with Late Prehistoric-aged deposits (Kibler and
Freeman 1993).

Early Archaic (6000â2500 B.C.)

Like the Paleoindian period, sites associated with the Early Archaic are rare in South Texas, and areas
such as the Rio Grande Delta and Sand Sheet have no representative sites for this time (Terneny
2005). Hesterâs distinction between the early corner-notched and the early basal-notched horizons
is primarily derived from data generated from Central Texas and the Lower Pecos areas with stronger
cultural chronologies (Hester 2004). Representative artifacts associated with the early cornernotched horizon include early expanding-stem (Bandy, Martindale, and Uvalde) dart points and the
Guadalupe distally beveled tool (Terneny 2005). The subsequent early basal- notched horizon
includes Bell and Andice points, early triangular bifaces, and Clear Fork tools (Hester 2004; Terneny
2005). The Mackenzie site (41VT17) in Victoria County produced Bell points and radiocarbon assays
indicating an Early Archaic occupation and thus became the oldest shell midden in South Texas
(Ricklis 1986).

Middle Archaic (2500â400 B.C.)

The Middle Archaic is identified by an easily recognized change in material culture patterns. This
includes assemblages in South Texas consisting of triangular dart point forms, known as Tortugas,
100033612/150039

9

III. Cultural Setting
Abasolo, and Carrizo. In addition, smaller unifacially distally beveled tools and stemmed projectile
points have been recovered in the northern part of South Texas. These points include Pedernales,
Lange, Langtry, and Morhiss (Hester 2004). Information on settlement patterns during this period is
sparse. However, substantial data from Choke Canyon and Chaparrosa indicate that open campsites
were located along former stream channels early in the period before relocating to floodplains, low
terraces, and natural levees later in the period (Hester 2004). Survey work in Willacy and Hidalgo
Counties has yielded dart points that may be Archaic (Mallouf et al. 1977). However, work at Falcon
Reservoir showed that some of these types continue into the Late Prehistoric period (Suhm and Jelks
1962). Investigations at the cemetery site Loma Sandia (41LK28) in Live Oak County yielded detailed
information on Middle Archaic burial practices derived from 205 burials, which included interments
with dart points, stone pipes, shell ornaments, and deer antlers (Taylor and Highley 1995).

Late Archaic (400 B.C.âA.D. 800)

Dart points associated with the Late Archaic are small, with corner or side notches. Examples
include Shumla, Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Montell, Fairland, and Ellis. Tools diagnostic of this period in
South Texas include Olmos bifaces, Nueces scrapers, and corner tang bifaces (Black 1989:51).
Examples of Late Archaic sites include Choke Canyon (41LK201), the Johnson site, the Kent-Crane
site (41AS3), and a site at Ingleside Cove. At Choke Canyon, hearths, earth ovens, and manos and
metates have been found, which illustrate exploitation of plant resources. Also recorded at the site
were faunal remains of deer, rabbit, turtles, fish, and other species, as well as evidence that peoples
were exploiting Rabdotus snails and mussel species (Hall et al. 1987). Additional data from Choke
Canyon illustrate that favored locales for open campsites are on stream channels and their adjacent
sloughs.

Late Prehistoric Period (circa A.D. 800â1600)

The Late Prehistoric occupation of the area by hunter-gatherer inhabitants has been often referred
to as the âBrownsville Complex.â This complex has been defined on basic analysis and characteristics
observed from small surface collections, salvage excavations, and a small number of cultural resource
surveys. However, Terneny (2005:225) argues that the â. . . [Brownsville Complex] artifact sets
thought to be present only in the Late Prehistoric burial situations were present in the Archaic as
well.â She goes on to say: âAs such, the âBrownsville Complexâ must be redefined in terms of its
presence in the Archaic and Late Prehistoric; cemeteries and burials that contain âBrownsville
Complexâ artifacts cannot automatically be assumed to belong to the Late Prehistoricâ (Terneny
2005:225).
Therefore, this Late Prehistoric section provides a summary of the Late Prehistoric period of South
Texas by Hester (2004) and a summary of the Brownsville Complex. However, the Brownsville
Complex summary should be understood as needing further research to determine a more precise
temporal affiliation (see Terneny 2005 for a more-in-depth discussion). Although a hunting and

gathering lifeway continues in the Late Prehistoric as in the Archaic, the material culture, hunting
patterns, settlement types, and other facets of the era mark a fairly distinctive break with the past
(Hester and Turner 2015). In this time period, the bow and arrow and pottery are introduced, along
with other distinctive types of stone tools (Hester and Turner 2015). As with any time period
distinction, there is limited evidence to suggest that a new phase of cultural history was launched by
the immigration of new peoples into the region as opposed to cultural diffusion or by the coming of
a radically new mode of subsistence such as agriculture. The mode of organization of the Late
Prehistoric people appears to mirror the full expression of traits already in existence. Therefore, it
appears the Late Prehistoric societies took certain practices begun in the Archaic period and refined
them to various degrees, which ultimately transformed the whole way of life.

The Late Prehistoric in southern Texas shares cultural patterns with Central Texas (Hester 2004).
This includes transitional Archaic âdart pointsâ such as Ensor and Matamoros, and Late Prehistoric
Scallorn arrow points found at Blue Bayou (41VT94) in Victoria County and a burial site in Frio
County. The main marker for the Late Prehistoric in the region is the occurrence of the Toyah horizon.
Artifacts associated with the Toyah horizon include the Perdiz arrow point, small end scrapers, flake
knives, beveled knives, bone-tempered pottery, perforators, shell ornaments, and assorted
ornamental beads and objects (Hester 2004). These have been found at sites in Jim Wells County
(41JW8) and Live Oak County (41LK201) and at other sites closer to central Texas. Although sites
closer to the project areas in Zapata and Webb Counties often yield Perdiz points and some
combination of Toyah-trait artifacts, the whole assemblage is not present, with bison often absent
(Hester 2004).
The bulk of our knowledge of the archaeology of the Late Prehistoric in South Texas is from
MacNeishâs (1958) definition of two closely related complexes, the Brownsville and Barril, for the
Lower Rio Grande area. This cultural complex has been defined on basic analysis and characteristics
observed from small surface collections, salvage excavations, and a small number of cultural resource
surveys. Common to both complexes are shell disks, pierced shell disk beads, plugs made from a
columella that are round in cross section, rectangular conch shell pendants, mollusc shell scrapers,
and Starr, Fresno, and Matamoros projectile points. Intrusive artifacts include pottery of Huastec
origin from southern Tamaulipas, which appears in occupation sites and in burials (Anderson 1932;
MacNeish 1947; Mason 1935), as well as obsidian and jadeite used in pendants. Burials of individuals
are tightly flexed and located away from living areas.

The largest known Brownsville/Barril site near the proposed project area is located approximately
19 miles (30 km) southwest of the western end of the survey corridor and is known as the Ayala site
(41HG1); the site is located on a bluff of a resaca and consisted of at least 45 flexed burials with
associated burial materials. The site has been heavily looted, but it has also been subjected to an
archaeological excavation (Campbell and Frizzell 1949; Hester and Ruecking 1969).

III. Cultural Setting

Protohistoric Period (circa A.D. 1600â1800)
The Protohistoric period is described as the transition period between the prehistoric and historic
periods. The beginning of the period is attributed to the arrival in the early 1600s of Europeans
(Spanish) to South Texas (Hester 2004). Native American sites from the final period are distinguished
by the presence of European and nonaboriginal American trade goods that date from the sixteenth
through mid-eighteenth centuries. Debris on Protohistoric sites indicates a continuation of the
nomadic hunting and gathering existence that was begun during the Archaic period. The best account
of the native peoples of Texas comes from the chronicle of Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca, a survivor of
a Spanish shipwreck in 1528 (Covey 1972). These first Spaniards encountered as many as 50
different groups living in the immediate area. Many of these indigenous people were identified as
speaking the Coahuiltecan language of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico (Salinas 1990).

The natural resources of the RÃ­o Grande provided sustenance for hunting and gathering groups for
millennia. The mid-eighteenth century colonists of Nuevo Santander encountered indigenous groups
and others that had been displaced from Nuevo Leon and elsewhere (Galindo 2003). It is difficult to
identify with certainty the groups that occupied eastern Nuevo LeÃ³n because the Spanish used
descriptive names and not their native ones (Salinas 1990:17). Group names were often duplicated
across vast geographical regions among unrelated peoples (Campbell and Campbell 1981; 1985:9â
10). These practices make it impossible in most cases to determine the continuity between groups
that may have migrated from Nuevo LeÃ³n to the RÃ­o Grande. MartÃ­n Salinas (1990), who built upon a
foundation of ethnographic work laid by Thomas N. Campbell (1958, 1979, 1983, 1984), examined
the primary documents created by the Spanish and extracted the scattered bits of information about
indigenous groups on both banks of the lower RÃ­o Grande.
When Jose de EscandÃ³n explored the region that became Nuevo Santander, he recorded at least 31
separately named Indian groups (Salinas 1990:19). For his 1747 report, EscandÃ³n apparently relied
on CapitÃ¡n Santiago, a leader of the Comecrudo group he encountered near his base camp, which was
near the modern city of Matamoros (Salinas 1990:29). He reported that about 2,500 families lived
south of the RÃ­o Grande, with the largest group being the Comecrudos. EscandÃ³n described Indians
that fished and hunted deer and birds with bows and arrows. He noted that the men wore no clothing,
while the women wore skirts made of animal skins or grass. CapitÃ¡n Santiago used smoke signals to
communicate with surrounding groups to announce a meeting with EscandÃ³n (Salinas 1990:29).
Comecrudo, Spanish for âthose who eat raw food,â is a name that was applied to at least three other
unrelated groups (Salinas 1990:35). Although he does not quantify, EscandÃ³n reported in 1755 that
there are many peaceful Indians who resided and worked with the colonists (Guerra 1989:18).
Agustin LÃ³pez de la CÃ¡mara Alta inspected Nuevo Santander in 1757 and recorded 14 Indian groups
for the RÃ­o Grande area (Salinas 1990:30). He wrote observations about eight of these that he
grouped together as having similar cultural traits. For example, he noted that all of them were
tattooed, although he could discern no correlation between the tattoo patterns and their ethnic

100033612/150039

12

III. Cultural Setting
affiliation (Salinas 1990:31). The men of these groups sported tattoos only on their faces, while
women adorned both their faces and bodies. LÃ³pez de la CÃ¡mara Alta alluded that these eight groups
spoke dialects of the same language, which may have been Comecrudo (Salinas 1990:31).

The Indian groups identified in colonial documents along the lower Rio Grande before 1790 include
the Comecrudos, Garzas, Malagueros (aka Malaguitas or Malahuecos), Narices, Nazas, Pintos,
Tejones, Zacatiles, and Zalayas (Galindo 2003; Salinas 1990). Between 1790 and 1818, other area
Indian groups are mentioned in missionary reports, including Aguichacas, Anda el Camino, Casas
Chiquitas, Chinitos, Como se Llaman, Cotonames, Cueros Quemados, Guajolotes (or Cacalotes),
Mayapemes, Pelones, Pajaritos, Saulapaguemes, Tampacuas, and Western and Eastern Carrizos
(Salinas 1990:153-158).

The Spanish encountered indigenous people speaking the Coahuiltecan language in southern Texas
and northeastern Mexico (Salinas 1990). The Coahuiltecan language is similar to the Karankawan,
which was spoken by coastal peoples north of Corpus Christi up to the west side of Galveston Bay
(Swanton 1940). From Corpus Christi, the Coahuiltecan area extended northwestward to San
Antonio, westward to just below the confluence of the Pecos River and Rio Grande, and southward
into Nuevo Leon, northeastern Coahuila, northern San Luis Potosi, northeastern Zacatecas, and
northern Tamaulipas. Coahuiltecan peoples were originally considered to be linguistically related to
the Hokan groups of languages in California (Ruecking 1955; Sapir 1920; Swanton 1940). The theory
of linking the prehistoric languages of Texas and California was known as the âHokan Hypothesesâ
(Lyle 1997). Current studies suggest that Coahuiltecan was an isolated language (Lyle 1997).

Research has indicated that the Coahuiltecans never existed as a single tribe. Rather, groups
with similar language were identified by the Spanish as Coahuilteco, presumably because the
native homeland of many groups was Coahuila, Mexico. By the 1850s, a combination of Europeanintroduced diseases and tribal wars stimulated by Europeans had decimated the Indians of South
Texas (Campbell 1958). There is no extant Coahuiltecan tribe today; however, there is a group
based in the San Antonio area that calls itself the Tap Pilamâthe Coahuiltecan Nation. They are
not a federally recognized tribe at this time, but the tribe has filed a petition for recognition by the
Secretary of the Interior that the group exists as an Indian tribe (Federal Register 1998).
There are no indigenous tribes extant in the area. Modern tribes that in the past have been active in
this part of Texas include the Comanche, Kiowa, and Lipan Apache. The Comanche and Kiowa, who
both were mobile Southern Plains tribes, came into South Texas following herds of wild mustangs
and bison as well as to raid Mexican towns near the present-day international border. The
traditional homeland of the Lipan Apache included the area between the Texas Panhandle and the
Hill Country of Central Texas; however, there were incursions by the Lipan Apache into southern
Texas.

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT IN HIDALGO AND CAMERON COUNTIES
The Lower Rio Grande Valley, with its rich and diverse history, has long played a pivotal role in the
history of the vast territories that extend on either side of the river. Because of its strategic location
upstream from the mouth of one of the great waterways of North America, the region has been an
important center of activity since the sixteenth century.

Colonial Contact and Early Settlement Period

Spain was the first European nation to lay claim to the region including present-day Hidalgo and
Cameron Counties and to make contact with the Native American groups living in the region. Spanish
exploration in the Rio Grande Valley may have occurred as early as 1528 when Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza
de Vaca reportedly traveled through the area following his shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico; however,
this theory remains unsubstantiated. After a series of attempts to settle other areas in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley by Gonzalo de Ocampo (1523), Sancho de Canielo (1528), and Pedro de Alvarado
(1535) proved unsuccessful, Spanish activity in the area centered on maintaining their sovereignty
over the region rather than on encouraging colonization. As a result, subsequent exploration of what
became Hidalgo and Cameron Counties was only initiated in response to feared encroachment by
other European nations (Dixon et al. 2003).

For example, in 1638, Jacinto GarcÃ­a de Sepulveda crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico (then Spanish
territory) in search of Dutch sailors reported to be in the current Hidalgo County area. The expedition
âmarched down the north bank of the river as far as the site of present Brownsvilleâ (Garza and Long
2015a). Other excursions into modern Hidalgo and Cameron Counties were made by Alonzo de LeÃ³n
in 1687 in search of a French fort on the Texas coast and in 1747 by Miguel de la Garza FalcÃ³n, who
traveled north of the Rio Grande in search of an area in which to establish a settlement. FalcÃ³n was
unimpressed and characterized the land north of the river as unfit for settlement or for stock raising
(Garza 2015a).

Despite FalcÃ³nâs opinion, the Spanish crown was determined to settle the region and tasked JosÃ© de
EscandÏn with colonizing the area along the Rio Grande. In 1746, he was appointed âconquistador
and governor of Nuevo Santander,â the larger region containing the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and
began the process of settling the area that continued throughout his 23-year-long career. Between
1748 and 1755, the civilian colonists of Nuevo Santander established 23 communities, including 6
along the banks of the RÃ­o Grande. These settlers received porciones, or land grants, in 1767 on which
to establish livestock ranches. The porciones were on both banks of the RÃ­o Grande, because Nuevo
Santanderâs northern boundary was the Nueces River. The pobladores, or colonists, and their
descendants literally lived con un pie en cada lado, with a foot on each side of river (Galindo 2003).
Ethnohistoric information documents the early settler practice of living and growing crops on the
south bank, while conducting ranching activities on the north bank of the RÃ­o Grande (CasteÃ±eda
1976). Thus, these ranches were among the first of their kind in present-day Texas, representing a
100033612/150039

14

III. Cultural Setting
unique form of civilian colonization based on the relocation of entire families, and without major
emphasis on missions or presidios (Galindo 2003).

Riverfront acreage was most valuable, as river access gave settlers the ability to irrigate their land
and provided a shipping channel. Thus, surveyors laid out riverfront porciones in long, narrow strips
extending several miles to the north. Larger grants were made north of the riverfront porciones and
were usually composed of significantly more acreage. These grants were typically intended for
livestock grazing, and many were granted to influential citizens of EscandÏnâs original settlements
(Lang and Long 2015).

Early landowners found the land conducive to livestock ranching, and several large-scale ranches
formed in the Lower Rio Grande area. Small communities of ranch workers and their families soon
developed in association with these ranches. The community of Hidalgo near the current project area
was created from one of these early settlements. In 1749, a member of EscandÏnâs colony settled near
the location of present-day Hidalgo. The settlement âwas known variously as La HabitaciÏn, Rancho
San Luis, and San Luisitoâ (Garza 2008b). Early settlers here spread out to found their own large
ranches in what became Hidalgo County (Garza 2008a).
Ranching continued to characterize the regionâs economy through the remainder of the eighteenth
century and into the period of Mexican rule. As original grantees died and passed their lands to their
heirs, the large ranches began to be subdivided. Through these subdivisions, new communities
developed, including La HabitaciÏn, Relampago, and PeÃ±itas (Garza 2008a).

Early settlement in present day Cameron County during the Spanish Colonial period was initiated
with the establishment of the community of San Juan de los Esteros (or present-day Matamoros)
along the southern banks of the Rio Grande. Ranchers there often used the lands along the northern
bank of the river as pasture for their livestock. In 1781, the Spanish government âgranted fifty-nine
leagues of land . . . on the north bank of the river (including all of the site of Brownsville) to JosÃ©
Salvador de la Garza.â He established a ranch in the area, and though several other grants were issued
in present day Cameron County during the Spanish and Mexican periods, it was still sparsely settled
at the advent of the Texas Revolution (Garza and Long 2015a).

Early landowners found the land conducive to livestock ranching, and several large-scale ranches
formed in the Lower Rio Grande area. Small communities of ranch workers and their families soon
developed in association with these ranches. Ranching continued to characterize the regionâs
economy through the remainder of the eighteenth century and into the period of Mexican
sovereignty. As original grantees died and passed their lands to their heirs, the large ranches began
to be subdivided. Through these subdivisions, new communities developed, and settlement
expanded to more remote parts of the region.

III. Cultural Setting

Mexican Sovereignty and the Texas Republic Era
Mexico received its independence from Spain in 1821, and the new government continued the
practice of encouraging settlement in the lower Rio Grande Valley, âespecially along the navigable
stretch of the river between the Gulf and Roma in Starr Countyâ (Dixon et al. 2003). During this
period, scattered ranching enterprises continued to characterize the local landscape. The key shift in
local development that occurred during the brief period of Mexican ascendency involved the
increasing importance of trade to the regional economy, which was a result of and in turn prompted
an influx of American and European entrepreneurs and settlers âseeking economic opportunitiesâ
(Dixon et al. 2003).

It was also during this period that steamship service was inaugurated along the Rio Grande. Henry
Austin, a cousin of Stephen F. Austin, arrived with his steamer Ariel from New York on June 29, 1829.
Despite Austin's grand intentions, the operation of the steamboat was not profitable. The difficulty
of navigation on the river and the lack of cooperation and participation among Mexican merchants
were prime factors for its abandonment in September 1830. Austin then took the vessel to the Brazos
River (Graf 1942). Although its impact on commercial trade was hardly noticeable, the arrival of
Austin's steamboat ushered in an era that gained considerable significance in subsequent decades.

Texas' struggle for independence, for the most part, bypassed the Lower Rio Grande Valley, as most
military and political events took place farther north. Following the war's conclusion, 4,000 soldiers
of Santa Anna's defeated army converged on Matamoros and depleted much of the available food
supplies. Commerce and trade in the town and nearby areas diminished with this sudden influx, but
its effects were only temporary. Soon, the economy rebounded and residents went on about their
business (Thompson 1965).

After the Republic of Texas was officially formed and was truly independent of Mexico, territory
between the Rio Grande and Nueces River was claimed by both countries. The inability of each
government to effectively control or exert much influence in this area left many residents vulnerable
to attack by Indians and roaming bands of "soldiers" of both countries. Another event that increased
tensions occurred in 1839 when Francisco Viadaurri and others declared that a new nation, the
Republic of the Rio Grande, was being formed from the Mexican states of Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua,
Coahuila and Tamaulipas, including the Lower Rio Grande. Laredo, a settlement established in 1755
by Jose de Escandon was selected as the capital of the newly-formed republic. Unlike the Texas war
for independence, this rebellion was successfully quelled by Mexican forces (Webb 1952).

The Mexican War

Disputes between Mexico and the United States erupted into full-scale warfare over the location of
the boundary between the two countries. The United States recognized the Rio Grande as the sole
boundary, while Mexico recognized the Rio Grande only to the headwaters of the Nueces River and
from that point following the Nueces to its mouth near Corpus Christi. Present day Hidalgo and
100033612/150039

III. Cultural Setting
Cameron Counties were part of the disputed territory during the Mexican War. The dispute reached
an impasse and President James Polk, in an effort to reinforce the American position, ordered General
Zachary Taylorâs army to the disputed areas. Taylorâs infantry, artillery, and support units arrived in
Corpus Christi via steamer from New Orleans, while his dragoons traveled overland from San
Antonio. Personnel from his army surveyed the area across for Matamoros, selecting a site for the
armyâs encampment.

Taylorâs army arrived at the Rio Grande following a brief skirmish with Mexican irregulars at Arroyo
Colorado. Taylor immediately began receiving dispatches from the Mexican commander General
Mejia ordering the Americans to withdraw from the Rio Grande. When Taylor refused, the Mexican
army placed artillery along the riverbank south of the fort. Taylor responded by placing his own
heavy artillery in position to fire on Matamoros and ordered his chief engineer, Captain Joseph K.F.
Mansfield to construct defensive works. Mansfield constructed a six-sided earthen bastion, 800 yards
in circumference, with walls 8.5 to 9 ft in height and surrounded by a ditch 20 ft wide and 9 to 10 ft
deep. The fortâs earthen ramparts were topped by wood and mud parapets and the bastions were
protected by sandbag merlons between gun embrasures (Mahr-Yanez and Perttula 1995). Before the
fort could be completed, Taylor was informed by Captain Walker of the Texas Rangers that Mexican
General Arista, now commanding the Mexican forces, had crossed the Rio Grande downstream from
the American army and was marching towards the American base at Port Isabel. Taylor, in a night
march, beat the Mexican army to Port Isabel and secured his supply line. In his absence, he left Major
Jacob Brown in command of the newly constructed fort, along with the 7th U.S. Infantry.

On May 3, the Mexican artillery opened fire on the fort. Major Brown responded with his artillery,
destroying one Mexican gun and forcing the Mexicans to reposition the others. The Mexican infantry
next attacked, but were repulsed. In an artillery bombardment on May 6, Major Brown received a
mortal would, dying on the afternoon of May 9.
After securing his supply base at Port Isabel, General Taylor returned to relieve the fortâs defenders.
On the return march, his forces encountered those of General Arista at Palo Alto and Resaca de la
Palma and inflicted severe casualties, forcing the Mexican army to retreat. Upon learning of Major
Brownâs death, Taylor ordered the fort named after him and pursued the Mexican army into
Matamoros.

All subsequent fighting took place within Mexico, thus, the battles at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma
were the only ones north of the Rio Grande. Hostilities ceased with the signing of the Treaty of
Hidalgo on July 4, 1848. Provisions of this agreement established the Rio Grande as the boundary
between the two countries, but also recognized land titles issued by the Spanish and Mexican
governments. All public lands, however, were granted to the State of Texas (Thompson 1965).

At the conclusion of the war with Mexico, counties were formed throughout southern Texas. Cameron
County was created by the Texas legislature and originally included 3,308 square miles âincluding
100033612/150039

17

III. Cultural Setting
parts of Hidalgo, Willacy, Kenedy, and Brooks Countiesâ (Garza and Long 2015a). Hidalgo County was
formed in 1850 and named for Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Mexican patriot (Dixon et al 2003).

Another significant event during this period was the designation of the Old Military Road. Zachary
Taylor oversaw the laying out of this road that connected Brownsville and Rio Grande City. The route,
roughly paralleling the Rio Grande, became a major transportation artery through the area, linking
many established communities and providing the impetus for the foundation of more communities
along its reach during the antebellum period. The route likely paralleled or followed established trails
linking area ranches and associated communities. Following the Mexican-American War, the road
continued to serve as a shipping route for cotton and other goods and as the Rio Grande valleyâs main
travel artery. The road was paved and improved by the 1960s and still serves as a major
transportation thoroughfare for the region (Jones 2015).

Nineteenth-Century Ranching and the Transition to Commercial Cultivation

By 1850, a number of large ranches were operating in present-day Cameron and Hidalgo Counties.
The ranches not only served as the economic mainstay for residents, but also influenced local
community development during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. For example, some of the
first communities established in Hidalgo County were developed in support of large ranches. La
HabitaciÏn, at the site of present-day Hidalgo, formed in association with Rancho San Luis in 1749
(Garza 2015b). The city of McAllen owes its roots to the McAllen Ranch, originally known as the Santa
Anita Ranch, founded circa 1797 by JosÃ© Manuel GÏmez, an original Spanish grantee (Garza 2015c).
Present-day PeÃ±itas originally served as the âcommon grazing groundsâ for EscandÏnâs Villa de
Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe de Reynosa located south of the Rio Grande in the mid-eighteenth
century. After 1850, the community was associated with numerous populous ranches in the area,
including those of RÏmulo MartÃ­nez and JesÃºs Chapa CantÃº (Garza 2015d).

Ranching continued to be an important part of the local economy during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries; however, the advent of irrigation and increased Anglo-American migration to
the area increased the significance of commercial agriculture during the period. One example of an
early commercial agricultural operation located in Hidalgo County was the San Juan Plantation,
named by owner John Closner. Closner began acquiring land in the area in 1884, and his plantation
eventually contained 45,000 acres. He was an innovator in the area and transformed the land through
a system of irrigation canals and a water pumping plant, creating the first irrigation system from the
Rio Grande. These efforts inspired the extensive irrigation systems now present in both counties.
Diverse crops were grown on the plantation, including sugarcane, alfalfa, tobacco, vegetables, fruits,
melons, and nuts, and he traded on both sides of the river. Many families worked on the plantation,
and a community developed in the area with a school and general store (McKenna 2015a; Texas
Historic Sites Atlas 1964). George Paul Brulay introduced irrigation on a small scale near Brownsville
in 1876, but irrigation remained limited in both counties through the turn of the twentieth century
(Garza and Long 2015a).

Railroad Era and Early-Twentieth-Century Development
The arrival of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway to the Rio Grande Valley in 1904
dramatically affected regional development patterns and increased the significance of commercial
agriculture further. New communities sprang up along the railway and subsequent lines that
intersected this route, and old settlements originally founded around ranches grew into sizable
communities. Notable examples in Hidalgo County include the community of Pharr, which was
originally part of lands granted to Juan JosÃ© Hinojosa in 1767 by the Spanish government. The
Hinojosa family resided in the region through the 1880s during which time the area remained
predominantly undeveloped. In 1909, partners John Connally Kelley Sr. and Henry N. Pharr
purchased 16,000 acres containing the future community. Pharr, a Louisiana sugarcane farmer and
founder of the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company, became the namesake of the community. Pharr
became a stop on the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway by 1911 (Garza 2015e; Meyers
[Myers] and Weitze 1995) and was the center of an agricultural boom that characterized
development in the area during the early twentieth century.

McAllen, which was a small community associated with the McAllen/Santa Anita Ranch established
circa 1797, also experienced a period of growth with the arrival of the railroad. In 1904, when the
Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached the site,
members of the BallÃ­ and McAllen families, proprietors of McAllen Ranch, donated land to allow the
railroad to cross their property. The McAllen Townsite Company formed later that year and named
the new townsite McAllen. McAllen grew at a steady, yet somewhat slower rate than other railroad
towns in the area due to competition from neighboring communities. However, the town
incorporated in 1911 and experienced a population boom during the late 1910s as a result of federal
troops being stationed in the area during World War I (Garza 2015c).

Similarly, the communities of Harlingen and Brownsville in Cameron County grew significantly after
the arrival of the railroad. Harlingen was founded in 1904, the same year the railroad arrived in the
area. Early promoters thought the nearby Arroyo Colorado could be used as a commercial waterway;
however, like other communities in the region, the cityâs economy was based almost solely on
agriculture during the early twentieth century (Gilbert 2015).
Brownsville already existed prior to the arrival of the railroad, though development there had
stagnated dramatically during the postbellum period due to lack of railroad access and a deepwater
port facility. After the construction of the railroad, not only did the agricultural economy of the area
diversify with the planting of the first citrus crop in 1904, but rail access also initiated dramatic
infrastructure improvements in the community as the city sought to make itself appealing to the
influx of new immigrants from the American Midwest. Growth continued through the first decades
of the twentieth century, and in the 1930s, the Port of Brownsville and associated shipping channel
opened, making the city an international trading port (Garza and Long 2015b).

Contemporaneous with the emergence of the railroad and its influence on local community and
economic development patterns, irrigation was also advancing in Hidalgo and Cameron Counties.
Advances in irrigation technology and the development of major irrigation systems increased both
large-scale commercial farming and small-scale irrigated farming in the area. As previously
mentioned, the first irrigation system in Hidalgo County was developed in 1895 to serve the San Juan
Plantation located on the banks of the Rio Grande. This private system was composed of pumping
stations, canals, and laterals (McKenna 2015b). The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation
Company, incorporated in 1905, constructed a massive system of pumping stations, canals, laterals,
and settling basins in Hidalgo County. This system, like many others, was a public system in that it
sold water to private landowners, allowing an increase in irrigated farmland (Goza 2015).
Between its inception and the 1920s, irrigation was the impetus for a steady pattern of AngloAmerican land promotion that altered the demographic, physical, political, and economic character
of the entire Rio Grande Valley. The recruitment procedures for new residents became formulaic
during this period. The process is described in detail in the NRHP nomination for the Louisiana-Rio
Grande Canal Company Irrigation System:
Valley land promotion from 1904 through the 1920s followed an elaborate, highly
orchestrated procedure. A group of private investors obtained a large parcel of land
with access to the Rio Grande where they established an irrigation system. Using
cheap, primarily Mexican American labor, they financed the construction of pumping
plants and irrigation canal systems. These systems extended throughout their
property, which was subdivided into 20- to 80-acre farm plots. Simultaneously, the
consortiums promoted their farms through mass distribution of glossy brochures
that extolled the valleyâs many virtuesâboth real and imaginedâparticularly to
midwestern [sic] farmers. . . . Interested parties contacted sales agents who enticed
them to the valley on excursion trips that land companies either partly or wholly
subsidized. (Meyers [Myers] and Weitze 1995)

Many of the new settlers considered themselves civilizers and pioneers and tended to alienate or
suppress the political and civil rights of the Mexican and Mexican-American residents who had lived
in the area for centuries. Tension between the groups erupted into violence or unrest at various times
during the twentieth century, particularly as the number of Mexican citizens seeking asylum from
the unrest at home and/or economic opportunities in the United States increased during the early
twentieth century. Many found work as underpaid farm labor on the newly irrigated lands of the
Anglo immigrants or even as workers constructing the elaborate irrigation systems that made the
regionâs transition into the âMagic Valleyâ possible.

III. Cultural Setting
The trend of increased irrigated farming and railroad expansion continued through the 1930s as
more railroad companies built lines through the area and irrigation improvements continued to
multiply. The areaâs transition from a ranch-based economy to one based on truck farming was
complete by 1930, when there were 4,321 farms in Hidalgo County and 2,936 in Cameron County,
âmore than double the number in 1920.â As in other areas of the state, the majority of the farms
engaged in cotton cultivation during the early twentieth century (Garza 2015a; Garza and Long
2015a), although truck farming was also significant to economic development in both counties
during the period.

Concurrent with the implementation of irrigation in the region, steps were taken to control periodic
flooding along the Rio Grande that, along with periods of drought, had plagued agricultural
development in the area. In 1892, W.H. Chatfield was the first to propose development of a levee
system for the Lower Rio Grande Valley that would address irrigation needs and flood control. His
plan included a series of levees, canals, and floodgates built around the resacas to collect water during
times of flooding and to distribute it in times of need (Matthews 1938:53â54). His plan was not
directly implemented, but may have influenced John Closnerâs development of an irrigation system
on his sugarcane plantation in 1895. Nevertheless, early canals did little to alleviate flooding in the
area, and flooding concerns were confronted in 1924 and again in 1925 when bond issues were
passed to build levees along the Rio Grande from Donna to Brownsville (Borunda 2007).

Though the levees were a limited success, the 1933 Brownsville Hurricane caused severe flooding
that resulted in a massive realignment of the Rio Grande. As a result of this and many other river
realignments, the original levees roughly follow the course of the river as it ran in 1903, with the
riverâs current position Â½ mile to the southwest. Historic map research suggests that the 1924/1925
levee system was subsequently adapted for irrigation purposes and is now located around resacas.
The 1933 flood also demonstrated that a levee system located only on the American side was
insufficient to control flooding in the area. In 1932, the International Boundary Commission (IBC)
recommended that floodways be constructed on either side of the river. These recommendations led
to the construction of â300 miles of river and floodway levees, improvements, and control worksâ
(Borunda 2007). The work was completed in 1951. The proposed survey corridor follows portions
of the larger IBC (now International Boundary and Water Commission [IBWC]) floodway, and many
of the existing canals recorded as part of the irrigation districts are also used for flood control.

Mid- to Late-Twentieth-Century Development

Unlike other areas in Texas and the country as a whole, the population and number of farms in the
Rio Grande Valley increased during the Great Depression. This was due in part to the discovery of oil
in 1934, which continued to represent an important part of the local economy through the remainder
of the twentieth century (Garza 2015a). Besides its economic impact, the success of the oil and gas
industry also resulted in significant alterations to the local built environment, as oil and gas wells and
related roadways became a common interruption in the agricultural landscape. Other extractive
100033612/150039

21

III. Cultural Setting
industries, such as sand and gravel quarrying, also aided the regionâs economic development and
altered the local landscape.

In the 1960s, a decline in the cotton market resulted in a dramatic reduction in land values in the
region, and many farmers sold all or portions of their land to developers. Some of these developers
platted new subdivisions near cities, where employment opportunities were available in processing
and other fields. In more-rural areas, some sold small plots at exorbitantly low rates to low-income
families. These areas, known as colonias, were located outside of city limits on unfavorable farmland
and were largely unregulated and without public services. These communities were characterized by
squalid living conditions and a lack of public works services. Many of the houses were constructed
by hand of scrap material, and residents obtained water from tainted wells or brought water in from
incorporated areas, often in contaminated containers. By the 1980s, activists began urging officials
to act regarding the high rates of disease in border colonias, but despite these efforts, no legislation
was passed (GarcÃ­a 2015). Many of these colonias remain in the area and are home to low-income
farm laborers and their families.

Hidalgo and Cameron Counties continue to depend heavily on large-scale agricultural production,
processing, and transportation, though commercial agricultural corporations have replaced the
independent growers as the biggest producers. The Old Military Road is now part of U.S. Highway
(US) 281, which links several international border-crossing points along the Rio Grande and
continues north to the Oklahoma-Texas state line. Since the passage of the North American Free
Trade Agreement in 1994, truck-transport traffic along the highway has increased in the region as
more imports from Mexico are brought to the United States (Vigness and Odintz 2015). Other
important facets of the areaâs economy and development at present include oil and gas extraction
and tourism.

PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND SITES

Atkins conducted a records search to locate recorded cultural resource sites within 1 km (0.6 mile)
of the survey corridor. Atkins consulted the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) online Restricted
Archeological Sites Atlas, maps and records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL),
the National Park Service NRHP database and GIS Spatial Data, and the Geographic Resources
Program National Historic Trails Map Viewer as well as the National Historic Landmarks Program
for locations of previously-recorded cultural resource sites. Sites designated as SALs, Official Texas
Historical Markers, and records of previously conducted cultural resource surveys were also
researched.
The background review revealed that the APE has not been previously surveyed, and no previously
recorded cultural resources are within a 1-km (0.62-mile) radius of the rerouted sections. Besides
the prior survey of the pipeline by Atkins (Burden et al. 2014a), there are seven surveys within 1 km
(0.62 mile) of the APE. A survey along US 77 was conducted to the west of Survey Area 2 on behalf of

The overall pipeline project corridor crosses four historic period irrigation districts: Cameron County
Irrigation District No. 1, also known as the Harlingen Irrigation District, Cameron County Irrigation
District No. 2, Cameron County Irrigation District No. 6, and Delta Lake Irrigation District (Figure 2).
Two of these districts are currently assumed eligible for inclusion in the NRHP by the THC pending
additional studies and one has been determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP by the THC. Survey
Area 1 is situated within the Delta Lake Irrigation District, Survey Area 3 is within Cameron County
Irrigation District No. 1, Survey Area 4 is within Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2, and Survey
Area 5 is within Cameron County Irrigation District No. 6.

IV. FIELD METHODS
Atkins archaeologists conducted an intensive archaeological field survey of the APE that was of
sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and, if possible, significance of any cultural
resources located within the APE. This investigation was performed in compliance with the NHPA
and in accordance with the Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR
800), the Rules of Practice and Procedure (13 TAC 26), and guidelines set forth by the CTA and RPA.
The survey met all Texas minimum archaeological survey standards, or Atkins thoroughly
documented any exceptions. The archaeological field crews judgmentally employed shovel testing
and mechanical trenching to probe for subsurface cultural materials, and visually inspected the
ground surface and any available cut bank exposures. The frequency and intensity of the shovel
testing regime was keyed to the level of disturbance of the APE and the nature of the soils, geology,
and topography.

SHOVEL TESTING

Shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm (3.9-inch) arbitrary levels to a 1-m (3.28-ft) depth or to preHolocene deposits, whichever comes first, and screening the matrix through 0.64-cm (Â¼-inch) mesh,
unless it was dominated by clay; clay soils were hand sorted and visually inspected for the presence
of cultural materials. Atkins plotted each shovel test location using a Trimble GPS receiver and
recorded each test on appropriate project field forms. Texas survey standards require 16 shovel tests
every 1.61 km (1 mile) for a linear project area that is 30 m (100 ft) wide. Shovel tests were typically
excavated at 100-m (330-ft) intervals along transects that were spaced 30 m (100 ft) apart. Shovel
testing frequency fluctuated depending on the nature of the disturbances, soils, topography, or
proximity of previously recorded cultural resources. Any areas determined in the field to be
sufficiently deflated, disturbed, and/or contaminated as to not require shovel testing were
documented, and the reason for not conducting shovel tests in that area is explained in the report.

BACKHOE TRENCHING

As the project area encompassed a topographic setting (i.e., Rio Grande floodplain) that has the
potential for deeply buried archaeological sites, investigation methods were proposed to reach these
deposits. The primary method for quickly and efficiently exploring such areas is mechanical
trenching. Specifically, the areas identified for horizontal directional drilling (HDD) were targeted
with backhoe trenches. Generally, the trench investigations were placed approximately 30 to 100 m
apart, with tighter intervals if necessary. Trench placement was based on the location of buried
utilities, the location of any impacted areas, and the preservation potential for archaeological sites.
Backhoe trenches were excavated to a depth sufficient to determine the presence/absence of buried
cultural materials and allow the complete recording of all features and geomorphic information to
depths of project impacts. Generally, trenches were a maximum 1.5 to 2 m (4.92 to 6.56 ft) deep, 8 m
(26.25 ft) in length, and 1.5 m (4.92 ft) wide. All trenching was monitored by experienced
100033612/150039

25

IV. Field Methods
archaeologists while excavations are underway. Stratigraphic soils descriptions were recorded and
photo-documented for each trench by an experienced archaeologist. Had any features been
encountered during trenching, they would have been mapped and photographed.

Safety is always a primary concern of Atkins when conducting trenching, particularly in deep
deposits. Prior to investigations, Atkins performed a One-Call (Texas 811) to verify there were no
existing utilities within the proposed excavation area. The One-Call notification required a 48-hour
notice prior to any excavations within the project area to properly mark and note any existing
utilities. All work was performed in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) (29 CFR Part 1926) and the Texas Trench Safety Act (H.B. 1569). Appropriate measures were
taken for any trenches that exceeded 2 m in depth, utilizing shoring or the stepping back of sidewalls
to ensure that all OSHA protocols were followed. The entire process was thoroughly photographed.
All trenches were backfilled and leveled upon completion of excavation and recording.
During the survey, all located cultural resources were fully defined within the project area. Field
crews explored any archaeological sites encountered during the investigations to the maximum
extent possible and with consideration to land access constraints. Sites were defined by a minimum
of six shovel tests except in areas where ground surface visibility was greater than 30 percent or
where precluded by soil conditions, disturbances, or project boundaries. Shovel tests were conducted
along radials from the site center at intervals not to exceed 10 m (30 ft) with site boundaries
determined by two negative shovel tests at the terminus of each radial, if applicable. Site features,
settings, and representative cultural materials were photographed, mapped, and marked with a GPS
device. A detailed plan map of each site was produced using standard techniques and features, and
site boundaries were documented using submeter GPS receiver. A State of Texas Archeological Site
Form was filled out for each site identified and submitted to TARL for the assignment of a trinomial.

Atkins conducted a diagnostic-only collection survey. Only artifacts such as projectile points, or
historic artifacts with makerâs marks or other definitive characteristics were to be collected during
the survey efforts. Artifacts such as common lithic debitage, historic-age trash, or burned rocks would
have been photo-documented, tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the field but not collected.
Had human remains been identified during the survey efforts, then all work would have immediately
ceased in the area, and Atkins would have contacted BPUB staff about the discovery.

CURATION

With permission from the THC, any artifacts collected were documented, photographed, and
discarded. Upon completion of all archaeological investigations, all paperwork was transported to
Atkinsâ in-house laboratory and prepared for curation. Atkins submitted this documentation to the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at The University of Texas at Austin.

V. RESULTS
The APE for the current survey involved rerouted sections of the proposed BPUB Cross Valley
Pipeline Project totaling 23.72 km (14.74 miles). The survey corridor measured approximately
27.43 m (90 ft) wide and involved the examination of five separate areas encompassing
approximately 208.60 ha (129.62 acres). The depth of impact is estimated from 2.44 to 6.1 m (8 to
20 ft.

A total of 108 shovel tests and 6 backhoe trenches were excavated within the survey corridor
(Appendix A). The shovel test depth averaged 55.11 cm (21.83 inches) below the surface (cmbs),
ranging from 30 to 105 cm (11.81 to 41.34 inches). Backhoe trenches were excavated to an average
depth of 1.39 m (4.6 ft), ranging from 1.34 to 1.45 m (4.40 to 4.78 ft) below the surface. They were
an average of 5.83 m (19.13 ft) long. Upon completion of recording, three of these were then
excavated to 2.44 m (8 ft), while archaeologists observed from the surface but did not enter the
deeper trench.

Much of the soil encountered was clay loam extending from surface (Figure 3). The majority of the
survey corridor consists of agricultural fields and some improved pasture, affording excellent ground
surface visibility that averaged 60 percent across much of it (Figure 4). Inundated areas and seasonal
wetlands were also encountered within the APE (Figure 5). Noted disturbances included agricultural
plowing, and construction related to canals, levees, roads, transmission lines, and pipelines (Figure
6).

SURVEY AREA 1
Survey Area 1 (SA 1) is along FM 493 in Hidalgo County and involves a 1,894-m (6,214-ft) reroute on
tracts TX-HI-0010 and TX-HI-0011 (Appendix A). Eight shovel tests were excavated within in the
APE, mainly at the northern and southern extremes. An isolated find (IF 1), a ceramic sherd, was
collected from shovel test NI 1 near the top of Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs [0 to 3.94 inches below surface]).
The body sherd of a probable plate had a dark blue glaze on both the interior and exterior, but no
diagnostic features. It appears to date to the mid- or late twentieth century, and may represent
Fiestaware, or something similar based on the concentric pattern evident on its interior. An area of
inundation stretching about 1,219 m (4,000 ft) was noted at SA 1, precluding shovel testing in this
area (see Figure 5). Other prior disturbances from agricultural activities and canal construction were
also documented.

SURVEY AREA 2

Survey Area 2 (SA 2) extends east from US 77 for about 6.6 km (4.10 miles) and is a reroute from
tract TX-CA-0034 to TX-CA-0040 (Appendix A). Fifty-one shovel tests were excavated, one site
(41CF223) was recorded, and IF 2 was noted across recently plowed and fallow fields in shovel test
KA 1. IF 2 is a shard of clear bottle glass that exhibited damage, probably from a plow observed within
the top 10 cm. The shard did not have any diagnostic characteristics or other contextual information;
thus, it was classified as an isolated find.

V. Results

SITE 41CF223
Site 41CF223 is a large sparse scattering of prehistoric burned clay balls situated within an
agricultural field that is both plowed and fallow. The site dimensions are approximately 3,330 m
(10,925.20 ft) east-west by 27.43 m (90 ft) north-south, although the artifact scatter extends in places
up to 14 m (45.93 ft) south of the APE (Appendix B). The nearest waterbody of significance is the
North Floodway, which is 3.90 km (2.42 miles) north, but an ephemeral drainage or relict channel is
evident at the site on a recent aerial and was encountered on the ground as a ditch near shovel test
RC 13. Soils at the site are mapped as Raymondville clay loam series (NRCS 2015); however, sediment
more like Racombes sandy clay loam was encountered throughout site 41CF223. The Racombes
series consists of deep, moderately well-drained, moderately permeable soil that formed in thick
alkaline sediments, usually located on deltaic coastal terraces. Ground surface visibility varied from
70 to nearly 100 percent across the site.

While most of the site boundary was determined by the surficial extent of burned clay balls and
fragments, a burned clay ball was observed in Level 7 (60 to 70 cmbs [23.62 to 27.56 inches below
surface]) of Shovel Test RC 9 at the extreme western end of the site. At this depth, soils were recorded
as brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay underlying a gray (10YR 5/1) sandy clay loam and the plow zone (0
to 30 cmbs [0 to 11.81 inches below surface]). Per THC standards, ground surface visibility
consistently exceeded 30 percent, so in lieu of radial shovel tests, the survey team conducted
systematic surface reconnaissance in the vicinity of Shovel Tests DB13, DB16, DB17, KA5, KA7 KA9,
M13, M15, RC9, RC12, RC 14, and RC16, observing multiple clusters of burned clay balls on the surface
and light scattering of clay balls throughout both plowed and fallow sections of the APE, as well as
one piece of heat-treated lithic debitage (Figure 7). A small representative sample of burned clay balls
was collected from the surface of the site. Clay balls were used in this region of Texas by prehistoric
people as heating elements in their hearths or cooking fires because naturally occurring rock is either
nonexistent or not of a type suitable for such use. A clay ball from Feature 2 at nearby site 41HG254
was radiocarbon dated to Cal B.C. 2200 to 2160 (Cal B.P. 4150 to 110)/Cal B.C. 2150 to 2030 (Cal B.P.
4100 to 3980) or 3710Â±30 years B.P. (Beta-370067), which is within the Middle Archaic cultural
division (Burden et al. 2014b).

In total, 31 shovel tests were excavated along the project corridor that are within the site boundary
(Table 2). All, except for RC 9, were negative for subsurface cultural materials. Thus, the siteâs artifact
assemblage was nearly exclusively surficial and evidently represents a secondary deposit that has
been churned by heavy machinery during agricultural production.

It is possible that instead of a single, nearly 3-km-long site, the artifacts represent several smaller
sites along this corridor; however, given the constraints of the survey limits, it was not possible to
further explore this possibility. Undoubtedly, site 41CF223 has been extremely disturbed by
agricultural operations, such as, grading, plowing, cultivating, and harvesting; the natural
disturbances from seasonal flooding; and the effects of the expansion-contraction cycle of the clay
soils at the site. No features or diagnostic artifacts were encountered on the surface or within any
shovel test excavated at site 41CF223.

irrigation canal and dredged material from the canal has been deposited here, forming a berm. This
section was not shovel tested. Two backhoe trenches (MS1 and MS2) were excavated on the south
side of an irrigation canal that separates tracts TX-CA-0095 and TX-CA-0096. A third trench (MS3)
was placed on the north side of the canal within tract TX-CA-0094. Four to five stratigraphic levels
were observed in the backhoe trenches, and all sediment profiles appeared intact, although a plow
zone was noted in Trench MS3. The water table was evident in all trenches at about 140 cmbs
(55.12 inches below surface); consequently, the trenches were not excavated any deeper. Typically,
the upper stratum of dark grayish-brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam was about 40 to 110 cm (15.75 to
43.31 inches) thick overlying about 25 to 40 cm (9.84 to 15.75 inches) of a yellowish-brown (10YR
5/4) clay with a markedly higher calcium carbonate content. The lower strata were also yellowishbrown to light brown (10YR 6/2) clay with a moisture content that increased with depth until the
water table was reached (Figure 8).

SURVEY AREA 5
Survey Area 5 (SA 5) is east of Old Alice Road near its intersection with Abrego Road in Cameron
County, and involves a 4,419.6-m (14,500-ft) reroute on tracts TX-CA-0136, TX-CA-0138, TX-CA0139, TX-CA-0140, TX-CA-0141, and TX-CA-0145 (Appendix A). An approximately 1,829-m
(6,000-ft) segment of the yellow reroute along the eastern edge was excluded from the survey by
BPUB after it was determined that much of it was inundated. Thirty-three shovel tests and 3 trenches
were excavated within SA 5; all were negative for cultural resources. Two backhoe trenches (MS4

and MS5) were excavated on the eastern and western sides of Old Alice Road, respectively. A third
trench (MS6) was placed on the north side of tract TX-CA-0136.

Six stratigraphic levels were observed in backhoe trench MS 4 on the east side of Old Alice Road. The
top two strata of brown (7.5YR 4/2 and 7.5YR 5/3) silty clay totaled 55 cm and were overlaying two
strata of reddish-brown (5YR 5/4) clay, a 30-cm (11.81-inch) stratum of yellowish-red (5YR 5/6)
clay that was mottled with 25 percent grayish-brown (10YR4/2) clay, and finally 15 cm (5.91 inches)
of yellowish-red (5YR 5/6) friable clay that was mottled with 15 percent white (5YR 8/1) sand and
25 percent grayish-brown (10YR 4/2) clay. MS 4 was excavated to 135 cmbs (4.43 ft below surface),
recorded, and then excavated to 2.44 m (8 ft), while archaeologists observed from the surface. The
mottling noted in the lower two strata continued as the matrix changed color to a light yellowish
brown (10YR 6/4) at 2.44 m (8 ft).

Four stratigraphic levels were observed in backhoe trench MS 5 on the west side of Old Alice Road.
The top stratum of reddish-gray (5YR 5/2) silty clay was 25 cm (9.84 inches) thick with no calcium
carbonate inclusions. It was overlaying a 25-cm (9.84-inch) stratum of reddish-brown (5YR 5/3) silty
clay with a calcium carbonate content of about 15 to 20 percent. Below that was a 45-cm (17.72-inch)
stratum of pink (7.5YR 7/3) silty clay loam with 20 percent brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay mottling and no
calcium carbonate. The lower stratum was a strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) silty clay with 10 percent
brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay mottling and 40 percent calcium carbonate. MS 5 was excavated to 140 cmbs
(4.59 ft below surface), recorded, and then excavated to 2.44 m (8 ft), while archaeologists observed
from the surface. The strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) silty clay recorded as the bottom stratum was
observed to continue to 2.44 m (8 ft) (Figure 9).

SURVEY AREA 6
Backhoe trench MS 6 was placed along the north side of tract TX-CA-0136 next to an irrigation canal.
One stratum of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay with 40 percent calcium carbonate inclusions
was recorded from the surface to 140 cmbs (4.59 ft below surface). MS 5 was excavated to 140 cmbs
(4.59 ft below surface), recorded, and then excavated to 2.44 m (8 ft), while archaeologists observed
from the surface. This homogenous matrix continued for about another 70 cm (27.56 inches) until
the soil color changed to yellowish brown, which was observed to continue to 2.44 m (8 ft) (Figure
10).

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Atkins conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of rerouted sections of the proposed Cross
Valley Pipeline Project on behalf of BPUB. The APE involved rerouted sections totaling 16.19 km
(10.06 miles) and included the examination of five separate areas, encompassing approximately
38.23 ha (94.47 acres). The depth of impact is estimated at 2.44 m (8 ft) throughout with deeper
impacts of up to 6.1 m (20 ft) at boring pits associated with HDD. All work was conducted under
Antiquities Code Permit No. 7208.

The background review revealed that the APE has not been previously surveyed, and that no
previously recorded cultural resources are within a 1-km (0.62-mile) radius of the rerouted sections.
The survey resulted in one newly recorded site (41CF223) and two isolated finds. Site 41CF223 is a
severely disturbed, prehistoric campsite with scattered burned clay balls mainly on the surface.
Repeated disturbances caused by long-term agriculture production has impacted the site to a
considerable degree and, it is unlikely any significant data could be recovered from a subsurface
context. Consequently, site 41CF223 is not recommended eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL, and no further work is recommended.

During the field survey, no cultural material besides burned clay balls associated with site 41CF223,
historic ceramic from IF 1, chipped glass from IF 2, and modern trash were encountered on the
surface or in 108 shovel tests and 6 backhoe trenches that were excavated within the APE. Of these
cultural materials, only a representative sample of the burned clay balls and the historic ceramic
were collected. Texas survey standards require 16 shovel tests every 1.61 km (1 mile) for a linear
project area that is 30 m (100 ft) wide, or 160 shovel tests in this case. The current survey did not
meet the minimum number of required excavations based on encountering prior disturbances from
agricultural activities, and construction related to canals, levees, roads, transmission lines, and
pipelines.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Atkins has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
archaeological historic properties within the APE. As no properties were identified that meet the
criteria for listing in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL according to 13
TAC 26.12, Atkins recommends no further work. Finally, nondiagnostic artifacts collected will be
discarded pending THC permission, and all project records will be curated at TARL.
In the unlikely event that cultural material are encountered during construction, work in the
immediate area should cease, and a qualified archaeologist should be called upon to evaluate the
evidence and provide recommendations for how to manage the resource under the Stateâs Historic
Preservation Plan. If human remains are encountered during the survey, all work will stop in the
immediate vicinity of the uncovered human remains, and the appropriate action taken per Chapters
711â715 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.
