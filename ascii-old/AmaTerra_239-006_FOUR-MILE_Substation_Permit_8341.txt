Cultural Resource Survey: LCRA TSC’s Proposed Four-Mile Electrical Substation, Crockett County, Texas

ABSTRACT
In March of 2018, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural resources investigation
in support of the Lower Colorado River Authority Transmission Services Corporation’s proposed FourMile Substation Project in Pecos County, Texas. The proposed substation will encompass an area of
approximately 8-acres. The proposed project area was assessed through a 100 percent pedestrian
archeological survey supplemented with judgementally placed shovel tests. AmaTerra conducted the
archeological survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8334.
The pedestrian survey targeted areas within the proposed 8-acre Four-Mile project area such as
topographical features that are more conducive to containing intact cultural deposits. Five shovel tests were
excavated within the proposed substation footprint. During the survey, AmaTerra archeologists re-located
and reassessed portions of one previously recorded site (41PC510). Investigators concluded that portions
of 41PC510 near the proposed project construction have potential to contain significant intact deposits that
may make it eligible for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), and therefore should be avoided.
Current project engineering designs indicate that the proposed construction will not impact any deposits
associated with 41PC510. Additionally, the Lower Colorado River Authority will not own or control those
portions of the property containing 41PC510. No other significant cultural resources were observed during
the survey. As such, AmaTerra recommends that the proposed construction should be allowed to proceed
as planned without additional investigations, as there is little to no potential for construction to affect
archeological historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4 (d) (1) or SALs.
No artifacts were collected during the survey. Project field documentation, photos, etc. and final report will
be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas-Austin.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
In March 2018, archeologists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra), at the request of the Lower
Colorado River Authority (LCRA), conducted a cultural resources survey of the Lower Colorado River
Authority Transmission Services Corporation’s (LCRA TSC) proposed new Four-Mile Substation on
approximately 8 acres of land in northeastern Pecos County, approximately 7 miles northeast of the town
of Bakersfield, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). There is direct access to the substation location. The project area
is located upon Indian Mesa between the heads of several drainages. An associated transmission line was
surveyed in the 1990s with negative results, however, in the intervening years, numerous prehistoric
archaeological sites have been recorded in the immediate vicinity.
As planned construction would occur on property owned or controlled by a political subdivision of the State
of Texas (LCRA TSC), the proposed project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT). The ACT, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code, defines the
necessary conditions for recognition and preservation State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires
that any political subdivision of the State of Texas, defined as a “local governmental entity created and
operating under the laws of this state, including a city, county, school district, or special district created
under the Texas Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the
code, must identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially
damage those SALs.
Field investigations were conducted on March 15, 2018 under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8334. W.
Nicholas Trierweiler served as the project’s Principal Investigator and James J. Hill acted as the project
archaeologist, while Steven Schooler assisted with field investigations. Archeologists encountered no
difficulties in completing the investigations.
The survey resulted in the revisit and assessment of portions of previously recorded Site 41PC510. Field
investigations were designed to comply with appropriate archeological field methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of Texas
Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in
conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to
identify and describe all archeological resources discovered within the study area, evaluate their eligibility
for formal SAL designation and, should archeological historic properties or sites be located, make
recommendations for future management options such as avoidance and preservation or further
investigations.
No artifacts were collected during the survey. Project field documentation, photos, etc. and final report will
be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas-Austin. This report is
divided into six chapters. The environmental setting and cultural overview are discussed in Chapters 2 and
3 respectively. Chapter 4 includes the field methodology implemented during the project. The results of
field investigations are presented in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 contains a summary and management
recommendations.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The proposed Four-Mile Substation project area is located along the Stockton Plateau, a subregion of the
Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion (Figure 3). This region is part of what is often referred to as the Trans-Pecos
area within the Mountain and Basin Ecological Area of Texas as described by Gould (1962). Although
considered a transitional zone, it compares more favorably with the topography and vegetation of the TransPecos area of West Texas. Typical Trans-Pecos landforms include mesa tops, talus slopes, valley flats, and
canyon washes which routinely observed throughout the APE. Similarly, the vegetation and soils are more
comparable with the Stockton Plateau subregion of the Chihuahuan Desert as described by Griffith et al.
(2007).
The West Texas region can be quite diverse and contains several north to south oriented mountain ranges
separated by internal drainage basins. It is characterized by a semiarid climate with a dominance of stunted
xerophytic vegetation. It is commonly considered a northern extension of the Chihuahuan Desert Province
(Blair 1950:105). The eastern extent of Pecos County is characterized by terrain consisting of high tabletop
mesas and wide-open prairies. Tributaries associated with the nearby Pecos River have created numerous
canyon washes and erosional drainages surrounding the proposed project area. This vast landscape
comprises an ecological transition zone at the junction of the high and rolling plains in the north, the
Edwards Plateau in the east, the scrub-brush country in the south, and the Chihuahuan Desert’s mountain
basins in the west. The proposed The Project is located within the Edwards Plateau physiographic region
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). This environment is an uplifted and elevated region originally
formed from marine deposits of sandstone, limestone, dolomites, and shales approximately 100 million
years ago during the Cretaceous Period when this region was predominantly covered by an ocean. The
western portion demonstrates a relatively flat elevated plateau. The eastern portion, known as the Texas
Hill Country, is largely eroded.

Geology and Soils
Geologically, the area is a continuation of the Cretaceous-age Edwards limestone that forms the core of the
terrain associated with the Stockton Plateau (Griffith et al. 2007:16). Soils overlying limestone include
Ector-Upton and Ector-Rock Associations (Figure 4). Regionally, most soils are aeolian and colluvial silty
clay and sandy clay loams (USDA-NRCS 2018).

Vegetation
Arid Chihuahuan Desert vegetation supported by this environment can include conifer and hardwood forest
flora. Vegetation observed during this survey included cedar, juniper, Spanish dagger aloerita, catclaw,
persimmon, sotol, yucca, prickly pear cactus, tasajillo, and numerous desert shrubs (Figure 5). The Pecos
River flows only a short distance east of the project area. Most precipitation in this area occurs in the
summer months during brief thunderstorms. The average annual rainfall is thirteen inches. Temperatures
range from an average low of 31 °F in January to an average high of 96 °F in July.

CHAPTER 3: REGIONAL CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL
BACKGROUND
The project area is situated at the crossroads of four archeological regions as defined by Perttula (2004)
(Figure 6). It resides almost at the border of the Trans-Pecos, Lower Pecos, Southern High Plains, and
Central Texas regions (Perttula 2004). It is characterized by its numerous natural rock shelters formed in
limestone canyons and cliffs, as well as its ubiquitous raw lithic outcrops and isolated micro-environments
near artesian springs. Offering protection from the elements, rockshelter localities were consistently
attractive to hunter-gatherers, and from an archeological standpoint, they create ideal conditions for the
preservation of burned rock middens, organic materials, burials, and petroglyphic and pictographic rock
art.
Typically, cultural chronology in Texas is divided into four major periods of time: Pre-Clovis and
Paleoindian (16,000–8800 years before the present [BP]), Archaic (8800–1200/1300 BP), Late Prehistoric
(1200/1300–250 BP), and Historic (250 BP–present) (Prewitt 1981). While the Prehistoric Periods are
principally defined by the presence of diagnostic projectile points and other technologies, they are intended
to order cultural change and are thus somewhat arbitrary; cultural change proceeded at somewhat different
rates over the vast area of Texas. A regional chronology of the Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric and
Historic periods are detailed in the following sections. Once a culture chronology for this region of Texas
has been summarized, a brief overview of archeological work in proximity to the project area will be
provided.

Pre-Clovis and Paleoindian (ca. 16,000–8800 BP)
Pre-Clovis and Paleoindian (ca. 16,000–8800 BP)
The arrival of humans in the New World may have occurred as early as 16,000 years ago (Jennings and
Waters 2014). Some evidence suggests the presence of Pre-Clovis occupations in Texas at the Debra L.
Friedkin Site located along Buttermilk Creek in Bell County (Waters et al. 2011). Artifacts found at this
site include bifaces, a discoidal core, edge-modified flake tools, blade fragments, bladelets, a polished piece
of hematite, and macrodebitage. Additionally, Pre- Clovis components have been reported from the Gault
Site, situated upstream from the Debra L. Friedkin Site.
The Paleoindian Period dates from approximately 11,500–8800 BP and is often subdivided into the Early
and Late Paleoindian subperiods (Collins 2004). The Paleoindian period was characterized by cooler and
wetter climatic conditions than today. Paleoindian peoples practiced unique subsistence patterns that
consisted of hunting now extinct megafauna and foraging from local plant resources (Black 1989; Mauldin
et al. 2003).
As the Pleistocene ended, diagnostic Paleoindian materials in the form of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview
projectile points began to enter the archeological record. These points were lanceolate-shaped and fluted
for hafting to wooden spears. Using the launching momentum from atlatls (spear-throwers), large game
such as mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse were frequently taken (Black 1989). In addition to
megafauna, Paleoindian groups likely harvested less daunting prey including antelope, turtle, frogs, etc.
Stylistic changes in projectile point technology occurred during this later portion of the period, eventually
shifting to Dalton, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina traditions. Environmental studies suggest that Late
Pleistocene Epoch climates were wetter and cooler (Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al. 1993) during
most of the Paleoindian Period with a gradual shift to drier and warmer conditions at the onset of the Early
Holocene Epoch (Bousman 1998).

The end of the Pleistocene was likely arid to semiarid, and prickly pear and agave populations were high
(Bousman et al. 1990:94, 98). As megafauna gradually died off during the shift to a warmer climate,
subsistence patterns shifted toward smaller game and plant foraging. Intact Paleoindian occupations in the
Trans-Pecos region are somewhat rare and consist mostly of kill sites found near rockshelters (Turpin
1995), or isolated projectile points within multicomponent scatters (Seebach 2001). This cultural change is
visible in the archaeological record and marks the onset of the Archaic Period.

Archaic Period (8800–1200/1300 BP)
The Archaic Period, which lasted approximately 7500 years, is divided into the Early, Middle, and Late
Archaic subperiods (Collins 2004). The Archaic Period exhibited a shift from more mobile hunting
strategies to a heavier reliance on a broader spectrum of local plants and animals (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004) and broadly dates to 8800–1200/1300 BP. Rockshelters were more intensively utilized during the
Archaic, thus leading to an increase in rock art. This period signifies a shift away from megafauna to smaller
animals, a more intensive reliance on plant resources, an increased use in ground stones for food processing,
a decrease in residential mobility, the systematic burial of the dead, the use of stone cooking technology,
and an increase in woodworking tools (Yelacic and Lohse 2011). The Late Archaic in the Trans-Pecos is
the best understood sequence and suggests that a population increase took place with a heavier reliance on
specialized food processing earth ovens (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Common site types of this period
include large-scale burned rock middens that are exposed on mesa tops overlooking canyons and water
sources.
Mallouf (1985: Figure 14) has summarized chronologies unique to the Trans-Pecos, and it was refined
further into ten prehistoric periods and a phase by Turpin (1995). Some overlap in projectile point
technologies is shared between the Trans Pecos and Central Texas. Hester places the Early Archaic in
neighboring Central Texas between 7950 and 4450 BP based on Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched projectile points (1995:436–438). Collins’ dating of the Early Archaic period to 8800–6000 BP is
founded on unstemmed point types (1995:383). Middle Archaic materials date from about 6000 to 4000 BP
(Collins 1995:383). The last subperiod of the Archaic falls between 4000 and 1200/1300 BP (Collins
1995:384).

Late Prehistoric (1200/1300–250 BP)
The commonly held date for the beginning of this interval is 1200/1300 BP with a hallmark transition to
the bow and arrow (Hester 1981). This technology enabled prehistoric hunters to harvest prey from greater
distances with a lesser need for brushless, wide open spaces required for atlatl maneuverability. The use of
arrows is indicated by smaller-sized, triangular projectile points. Another turning point in the Late
Prehistoric period is the first substantial presence of pottery. Trans-Pecos sites dating to the Late Prehistoric
suggest a continued reliance on rockshelters, but also show up in the form of tipi rings, cairn burials, and
pit houses built along water source terraces. Perdiz arrow points, groundstone implements, beveled bifacial
knives, end-notched sinker stones, and ornamental beads add more diversity to the archeological record
during this interval.

Historic
Beginning in the late AD 1500s, Europeans entered what is now Texas only sporadically. The first exposure
to European contact comes with the arrival of Alva Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca and the remaining survivors of
the Narvaez expedition in 1528. In Pecos County, the first Spaniards to pass through the area were part of
the Gaspar Castaño de Sosa mining expedition in 1590 (Smith 2016). Between 1528 and the late 1600s,
Spanish excursions into the Texas territory were limited, but Spanish records described a number of Native
American tribes like the Coahuiltecans. They were described as family units of hunter gatherers that resided
near streams and springs, whose camps were revisited on a seasonal basis (Campbell 1983:349–351). By

the mid-1700s, the Comanche had begun entering the region from the north, following the buffalo
migrations. Efficiency on horseback allowed them to displace numerous native groups and control trade
and prime hunting grounds. In 1821, Spain lost control of most of its North American territories when it
recognized the independence of Mexico. Anglo settlement in Texas soon followed in the 1830s when
Stephen F. Austin’s colonists were allotted impresario contracts by the newly formed Mexican government.
After the fight for Texas Independence, independent Republic of Texas prospered for ten years, eventually
joining the United States in 1845. The threat of Indian hostility was still present, especially in the vicinity
of the Pecos River. To safeguard travelers from Indian attack and to protect the San Antonio-El Paso Mail
route, the United States Army established Fort Lancaster in 1855 (Smith 2016). As for much of West Texas,
ranching dominated the local economy for decades. Today, Pecos County is still largely rural, but ranching
coupled with petroleum and natural gas development has supported a stable economy.

Previous Cultural Resources Investigations
An archeological background review was conducted in February 2018. The Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) was consulted to identify previous surveys and recorded cultural resources. This review
focused on the identification of previously recorded archaeological sites, Registered Texas Historic
Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed as SALs, sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP),
cemeteries, and archaeological surveys within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the project area (Figure 7).
According to the Atlas, seven previously recorded sites are located within one-kilometer of the project area.
These sites do not appear to be related to a recorded survey. Five of these, 41PC502, 41PC505, 41PC509,
41PC514, and 51PC543 are small, prehistoric sites, with minimal information available on the Atlas, but
in 2003 the Texas SHPO determined all five to be eligible for the NRHP. The sites are located about 200
m north, 900 m northeast, 200 m south, 400 m northeast, and 900 m south of the substation, respectively.
Recorded in 2000 by Bill Weaver and Molly Godwin, site 41PC510 is recorded as a prehistoric site
containing several thermal features including burned rock middens. The site was originally recommended
as having research value due to the presence of multiple thermal features. Portions of the site were located
within the original survey area for the Four-Mile Substation. However, currently engineered construction
deigns indicate the site boundaries are outside of the proposed construction. Finally, site 41PC531 is a very
large (250x100 m) prehistoric site containing multiple hearths and burned rock features located on a mesa
landform about 550 m due west of the substation. Artifacts include numerous flakes, bifaces, unifaces,
modified flakes, a Middle Archaic dart point, scrapers, utilized flakes, and ground stone. Portions of the
site are eroding into gullies and large areas of surface disturbance are noted, but an estimated 30-cm of
deposits may be present. In 2001, the SHPO determined the site to be ineligible
for the NRHP. On the basis of these sites, it is possible that the 8-acre survey parcel may contain burned
rock hearth features. If these are intact and undisturbed, it is possible that the locations may be considered
eligible for the NRHP.
Review of historic aerial photography and maps show that historically the area has been rural, with no
indication of residential or commercial development. Much of the area is characterized by existing and
derelict oil and gas wells and accompanying infrastructure. Aerial photography shows some development
in the area, with the presence of access roads and structures associated with nearby ranches located in and
around the proposed project area. Examination of more recent USGS topographic maps indicate the area is
still largely undeveloped except for features associated with the gas and oil industry as indicated on a series
of 1973 USGS 7.5 quadrangle maps south of Iraan, Texas (Figure 8). Recent aerial photographs show a
significant increase in the development of oil and gas infrastructure in the area.

CHAPTER 4: METHODS
Prior to field investigations, archaeologists conducted archival research to assess the potential for historicperiod archaeological materials. This research involved examining historical maps and aerial photographs.
In addition, archaeologists consulted the Atlas (2018) to assess the potential for previously recorded
archaeological sites within the project area, as well as a review of literature on archaeological sites within
the region. This allowed investigators to identify previously recorded archaeological sites adjacent to or
within the project area, and provided insight into site types, site settings, artifact assemblages, and average
depth of cultural materials below the ground surface. Lastly, the proposed project area limits were overlaid
on aerial based gridded maps and loaded onto hand-held GPS units to aid in navigation.
Field investigation of the proposed Four-Mile Substation project area was conducted according to standard
survey methods and under appropriate guidelines. Review of USGS topographic maps in combination with
field investigations revealed that the majority of the proposed project area crosses denuded upland terrain
containing shallow soils. The survey was conducted March 15, 2018 and conformed to survey standards set
forth by the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA). Field investigations consisted of a 100 percent
pedestrian survey supplemented by judgementally placed shovel tests. Survey transects were spaced 30-m
apart. Shovel tests typically measured 30 cm in diameter and ranged between 25 and 70 cm in depth. The
shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm increments and all removed soil was screened through ¼ inch
hardware mesh to ensure artifact recovery. Appropriate shovel test data was recorded on an AmaTerra
shovel test forms, and all shovel test locations were plotted with a hand-held global positioning system
(GPS) receiver.
During pedestrian survey, the ground was thoroughly inspected for cultural materials which were identified
as FCR and debitage in varying stages of lithic reduction. For the purposes of this survey, an archeological
site had to contain a certain number of cultural materials or features older than 50 years within a given area.
The criteria for recorded an archeological site employed during the survey was: 1) five or more surface
artifacts within a 15-m radius, or 2) a single cultural feature, such as a hearth or rock art, observed on the
surface.
One previously recorded site (41PC510) was relocated and reassessed during the survey. Specific
information on 41PC510 was recorded in the field through field notes, hand-drawn maps, digital
photographs, and GPS points. Any artifacts found either on the surface or in shovel tests were catalogued
and photographed in the field and returned to their original locations. No artifacts were collected during the
survey.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
A total of eight acres was surveyed as part of LCRA’s proposed Four-Mile Substation Project. Through
these efforts one previously recorded site (41PC510) was revisited and assessed. A total of 5 shovel tests
were excavated during the survey; one of which was placed within the boundaries of 41PC510 (Figures 9
and 10). The remaining four shovel tests were placed throughout the proposed project area in locations
deemed to have potential for containing deeper soils that may harbor archeological material. Two shovel
tests were positive for cultural materials (Shovel Tests 4 and 5). Shovel Test 4 was placed immediately
adjacent to a Burned Rock Midden (BRM) associated with 41PC510 and yielded one piece of FCR (~8 cm)
in the upper 10 cm and one tertiary flake between 40 and 60 cm below the surface. Bedrock was
encountered at 70 cm in Shovel Test 4. Shovel Test 5 was placed near the center of the proposed project
area and yielded one flake between 20 and 30 cm below the surface. Bedrock was encountered in Shovel
Test 5 at 30 cm below the surface. The remaining three shovel tests all encountered bedrock between 25
and 40 cm below the surface. All five shovel tests revealed similar silty loam sediment overlying shallow
bedrock. All artifacts were field catalogued and returned to their original locations as per LCRA
requirement that no artifacts were to be collected during the survey.

Site Description
Site 41PC510
Site 41PC510 is defined by three thermal features including a large circular burned rock midden and a
small, surficial lithic scatter surrounding the midden. The site is situated northeast-southwest atop Indian
Mesa. The site appears to be mostly undisturbed, though surface artifacts are sparse although debitage was
observed within and around the midden. Based on the 2000 Texas Archeological Site Data Form, the site
measures approximately 140 m north-west by 90 m north-south. Temporally diagnostic materials were not
observed. Portions of the site were blanketed in dense grass cover, but overall ground exposure was
excellent (Figure 11). Surface visibility ranged from 30-90% across the site. Ground surface is mostly
rocky and shovel testing demonstrated rather shallow deposits of aeolian silts above decaying bedrock.
Vegetation included prickly pear, stunted mesquite, small cedars/junipers, large tufts of "bear grass",
Spanish dagger, Mormon tea, catclaw acacia, and various bunch grasses.
The midden feature measures approximately 25 m in diameter both N-S and E-W, with a main core of very
dense FCR approximately 15 m wide (Figure 12). Scattered, diffuse FCR extends out from the midden in
all directions for about 30–40 m. The midden rises gradually to approximately 40 cm above the surrounding
terrain at its center. It is comprised of limestone cobbles up to approximately 15–20 cm in size, with most
under 10 cm in diameter. The burned rocks appear well reduced and angular, suggestive of multiple use
episodes. Intactness is estimated at about 75 percent. The midden does not extend to the other side of the
well-graded caliche road, but the road has impacted at least a portion of the midden, with darker compacted
soil and FCR visible within the road. However, the bulk of the midden remains unaffected by the road.
A single shovel test was excavated within the midden feature to probe for subsurface deposits. ST 4 was
dug immediately adjacent to Feature 1 at its northwestern side, approximately 2 meters north of the primary
FCR concentration. Silty soil extended 70 cmbs before scraping bedrock, suggesting the potential for
substantially buried deposits within the core of the midden. One piece of FCR (~8cm wide) was recovered
in the upper 10 cmbs, and one gray tertiary chert flake from 40-60 cmbs. Only a single shovel test was
excavated within the midden feature in order to retain its maximum amount of integrity as it is where an
estimated 95 percent of the overall research potential for the site resides.
Based on LCRA TSC’s proposed construction plans, the current undertaking will have no impact on site
41PC510 (Figure 13). Additionally, LCRA will not own or control the property containing 41PC510.
However, the site does have potential for further archeological research due to the intact nature of the
midden in addition to other thermal features. Investigators recommend site 41PC510 has unknown NRHP
and SAL eligibility. Avoidance of the site is recommended and if avoidance is not possible, formal SALtesting is recommended.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND MANAGEMENT
RECOMMENDATIONS
AmaTerra surveyed a total of eight acres for the proposed Four-Mile Substation project in Crockett County,
Texas. Access was available to the entire proposed project area and archaeologists did not encounter any
conditions that inhibited the survey. AmaTerra conducted the cultural resource survey under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 8334 and work conformed to the guidelines for implementation of these regulations
under 13 TAC Chapter 26.
During the survey, archaeologists excavated five shovel tests, all of which were located within the footprint
of the proposed 8-acre substation location. All shovel tests revealed silty clay loams and sandy loams
overlying shallow bedrock or upland gravels. Survey crews re-located and reassessed portions of previously
recorded 41PC510.
Site 41PC510 is a prehistoric burned rock midden and thermal feature site consisting of a moderately
surficial lithic scatter. Temporally diagnostic materials were not observed. The site was evaluated using
criteria outlined under 13 TAC 26. Although 41PC510 had shallow soils, an abundance of surficial artifacts,
consisting mostly of lithic debitage, was noted. Additionally, distinct burned rock midden features were
recorded and likely contain intact deposits that have potential for further archeological research and could
contain significant information pertaining to the prehistoric period of West Texas. As such, 41PC510 is
recommended as eligible for listing as a SAL and avoidance of the site is recommended. Based on LCRA
TSC’s current engineering construction design, Site 41PC510 will not be impacted by the proposed
construction, nor will LCRA own or control that portion of the property containing the site. If future
avoidance is not possible, formal NRHP/SAL-testing is recommended.
Field investigations in the remaining portions of the proposed project area did not identify any significant
cultural materials or sites. Based on the results of the survey, AmaTerra recommends that the proposed
construction for LCRA TSC’s Four-Mile Substation should be allowed to proceed as planned without
additional investigations as no historic archeological properties pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4 (d) (1) or SALs
(13 TAC 26.12) will be impacted. If it is determined that the proposed project requires additional acreage
or new access roads not included in the current study, then additional cultural resources investigations may
be necessary in those areas. In the event that previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during
construction, work in the immediate area of discovery would cease and the THC will be contacted.
