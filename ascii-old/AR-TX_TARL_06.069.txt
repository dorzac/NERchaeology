A RECONNAISSANCE AND ASSESSMENT OF THE
PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

Duford W. Skelton
ABSTRACT
A reaonnaissance level survey in 1976, followed by an
intensive survey of a randomly selected'10 peraent sample of
a 960 square kilometer area of Dona Ana Range, New Mexico,
resulted in the recording of 198 prehistoric sites.
Conduated
by the Texas Archeological Survey for the U.S. Army - Fort Bliss
under the auspices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort
Worth District, this survey concentrated on the preliminary
assessment of the cultural resources contained within two
physiographic zones - the desert lowlands of the Tularosa
Valley and the aoalesced fans of the Organ, Jarilla and
Franklin mountains.
The Organ Mountains, a major topographic
feature and the impact area for missile fire on Dona Ana Range,
were excluded from the sample universe.
The 198 prehistoric sites are categorized by phases and
site types based on the surficially exposed artifacts and
features.
The distribution of site types and the apparent
patterning of the occupation of the desert lowlands and the
coalesced fans is presented.
Part III offers estimates of site condition and
evaluation of military impact and natural deterioration of the
cultural resources.
The general aondition of sites on Dona
Ana Range is found to be poor and the rate of destruction,
espeaiaZZy from military Zand-use practices, is high.
INTRODUCTION
This report was prepared in an effort to provide preliminary evaluations of the prehistoric resources identified
during a reconnaissance level archeological survey carried out
by the Texas Archeological Survey at Dona Ana Range, Otero
and Dona Ana counties, New Mexico (Fig. 1), under the auspices
of the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers.
Archeological investigations on Dena Ana Range were accomplished
during two field seasons and numerous short excursions during
the interim period.
The first field season, during the
months of July and August 1976, was initiated with an attempt
to orient crew members to the possible dangers inherent in
conducting archeological field work on an active military
base.
FiEld crews were informed that Dona Ana Range has never

4

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

been 'swept' and therefore contained unknown quantities of
potentially lethal, unexploded ordnance.
Thanks to the
guidance and instruction provided by numerous military
personnel, and perhaps even the Almighty, no major injuries
were incurred throughout the entire investigation.
In
addifion to crew orientation, the first phase of actual field
work was begun by gathering background information on the
general character of the topography and on tactical problems
which might be encountered during the reconnaissance.
Casual surveys were also conducted to obtain initial impressions
of the nature and condition of the prehistoric resources, as
well as adding to the known resource base.
Local amateur
archeological societies were contacted,·and provided information
on prehistoric sites in the study area.
The assistance of the
El Paso Archeological Society is particularly acknowledged
in this regard.
The second field season was initiated in March and
completed in July of 1977.
It consisted of intensive pedestrian
surveys covering a randomly selected 10 percent (96 square
kilometers) of the area available for study.
However, by
then a large portion of the Range, the 35,000 acre "Impact
Area", had been removed by the U.S. Army - Fort Bliss, from
our originally assigned sampling universe.
Since most of the
Organ Mountains area included in Dona Ana Range is also included
in the Impact Area, this highly distinctive topographic
zone was virtually excluded from our sample.
It should be
emphasized at this time that these severe geographic bounds
placed substantial limits on efforts we subsequently made to
understand regional prehistoric land use patterns.
The same
constraints will apply, of course, to subsequent regionally
oriented investigations, so long as the Organ Mountains are
not fairly represented in the sample.
The principal aims of this phase of investigations were
the following:
1)
To obtain a quantified sample inventory of the
prehistoric resources;
2)
To provide preliminary assessments of the identified
resources in terms of their potential for yielding
reliable scientific and historic information;
3)
To estimate the effects of military activities and
related adverse impact on the demonstrated resources;
4)
To submit recommendations aimed at lessening the
effects of military use of the property - hopefully
of use in development of an on-going program of
cultural resource management by the Army;
5)
To provide suggestions for further investigations of
prehistoric resources based on the results of the
reconnaissance.
The findings of a similar assessment and inventory of the
historical resources are detailed in the second section of
this report.

INTRODUCTION

5

The Dona Ana Range encompasses portions of the Tularosa
Basin and Organ Mountains of south-central New Mexico.
The
area is part of Fenneman's (1931) Basin and Range physiographic province, a zone of roughly parallel mountain chains
separated by large, rather flat basins.
The Organ Mountains are one range of a chain of peaks,
mostly independent fault blocks, which extend north from El
Paso for approximately 250 miles.
The Organs are quite
precipitous, rising to elevations of approximately 8000 feet
{Fig. 2a) •
East of the Organ Mountains lies the Tularosa Basin, a
valley floored with Quaternary sediment.s (Fig. 2b).
Semistabilized dunes and shallow relict playas cover portions of
the flat valley floor.
The basin drains internally, with
occasional arroyos and washes, erosional features which seldom
carry water.
The climate of the Dona Ana Range, like that of much of
the semi-arid Southwest, is characterized by hot days and cool
nights, often with quite dramatic diurnal temperature
fluctuations.
The humidity is low and the evapotranspiration
rate consistentlj exceeds precipitation.
The average annual
rainfall is less than 10 inches in the lowlands, and approximately 12 inches in the uplands.
Occasional violent, localized
thunderstorms result in brief periods of rapid runoff.
RESEARCH DESIGN
Dona Ana Range encompasses 297,000 acres, of which an
estimated 260,000 were accessible for study.
Due to the
extremely high frequency of unexplored ordnance there, the
35,000 acre Impact Area was excluded from the sampling universe
(see Fig. 1).
Numerous factors, including the size of the
area being sampled, tactical problems such as access, attempts
to minimize bias, the unknown character of the natural strata,
and, of course, cost efficiency, affected the final choice of
a sampling procedure. With an awareness of the study requirements, and the limitations imposed by these conditions, a 10
percent random sample was selected.
The general procedure was to assign consecutive numbers
to the kilometer square blocks superimposed on the topographic
maps of the area by the U.T.M. grid system.
This resulted in
981 units or partial units totaling 960 square kilometers,
from which 10 percent, or 96 kilometer -square quadrats, were
selected at random (Fig. 3) . 1

I, page 211.

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

The principal advantage gained by employing a random
sample method is the ability to statistically manipulate the
raw data and estimate sample reiability.
Although it has
been suggested that the nonstratified random quadrat sampling
design may not be the best method of obtaining a totally
reliable sample (Judge, Ebert and Hitchcock, 1975), this design
is believed to be most applicable due to the conditions on
Dona Ana Range.
The unknown nature of the natural strata
and the minimization of bias were major considerations.
It
must be stressed that the general lack of specific detailed
information concerning the geomorphic characteristics of Dona
Ana Range precluded stratification of the sample quadrats.
However, at the completion of these investigations enough
information had been gathered by the field personnel to identify
various physiographic units on Dona Ana Range.
This information
was used to determine if associations could be recognized
between prehistoric settlements and geomorphological constraints,
specifically physiographic, geologic, and pedologic settings
(see section on Physiographic Zones and Appendix I).
For
example, five physiographic zones were defined - the Organ
Mountains, Jarilla Mountains, Franklin Mountains, Coalesced
Fans, and Tularosa Valley Floor.
Prehistoric settlement types
and densities were compared between the zones, and statistical
manipulations were performed to aid in determining significant
levels of possible settlement associations.
In any event, the
nonstratified random sample is believed sufficient to allow
certain general statements concerning the nature of prehistoric
settlements identified within survey units.
METHODS
THE FIELD CREW
The field crew generally consisted of three persons,
although the number varied between one and seven at different
times during the 1977 season.
Additonal personnel included
an historian, a field geologist, a geological consultant, and
a botanist.
David S. Dibble, Project Director, spent 25 days
conducting the initial reconnaissance and supervising the
field crew during the sample survey.
SURVEY QUADRATS
The 96 pre-selected survey unit quadrats were located in
the field by measuring from fixed known points, such as road
intersections, power lines, bench marks, towers, and other
military features indicated on field maps.
Distance and
location measurements were obtained using pocket transit
azimuth sightings from known points, and vehicle odometersThe quadrat corners were marked with 4-meter range poles

topped with flagging tape streamers.
The poles were placed
atop the highest features near the quadrat corners, usually
large dunes, which made them clearly visible during the
investigation of a given unit.
SURFACE INSPECTIONS
Each of the 96 quadrats was subjected to an intensive
survey.
During this procedure, researchers transected each
one-square-kilometer unit, on foot, a total of 12 to 16 times.
Approximately one square kilometer could be completed by two
crew members in a single day, depending ~n terrain and site
density.
Crews were instructed on the definition of a site,
to record isolated finds in the field notes, to limit collecting
to diagnostic projectile points and a small sample of ceramics,
and in the procedures of recording.
THE SITE CONCEPT
The term "site", as used herein, refers to any location
which exhibits by-products and residues of human activity.
With such a broad definition, a site may reflect anything from
a small isolated scatter of pottery and chipping debitage with
an areal extent of one meter square to the largest of village
settlements encompassing as much as 50 hectares.
The definition
is not restricted to any strict quantitative or theoretical
considerations of what constitutes a site.
The only evidence
of prehistoric peoples not recorded as sites were isolated
single artifacts and very small scatters of unassociated pottery
fragments, both of which presumably represent discarded or lost
specimens.
These isolated finds were noted in the field
journals.
Field observations included sites of both prehistoric
and historic age.
In the case of the latter, features of
possible interest were reported to the project historian for
evaluation.
SITE DOCUMENTATION
Whenever cultural residues were encountered, a detailed
descriptive account was made of all exposed material, recognized
or suspected associations and relationships between site
components, and any other relevant observations.
The sites
were plotted on Department of Defense (D.O.D.) topographic
maps by pacing off the distance to quadrat boundaries, or by
triangulation of azimuth readings taken with Brunton Transits
from points as near as possible to the center of the occupation
to the range poles at the quadrat corners.
The areal extent
of each site was estimated by pacing or measuring out in
cardinal directions from the assumed center of the site.
Specific information gathered from the critical examination

METHODS

11

of site structures included descriptions of the type, size,
frequency, spatial distribution, and character of all visible
structural features and associated material culture remnants.
Additional data obtained from the sites includes prominent
physiographic features, location and type of nearest known water
supply, general soil characteristics, and type and density
of vegetation, as well as other environmental considerations.
Active erosional and depositional processes were noted, as
well as evidence of vandalism or of physical impact from
military land use.
A subjective percentage estimate of the
amount of impact or disruption to surfically exposed materials
was also made.
Recorded sites were assigned temporary field numbers
according to the numerical order of site recognition within
each survey unit.
Upon completion of the field work, sites were
numbered in a consecutive system with the prefix "D" (for Dona
Ana), hence D-1 to D-198.
Site records were supplied to
appropriate New Mexico state agencies for the application of
permanent designators (See Table III-1).
SURFACE COLLECTIONS
Material removed from the sites during the field investigation consisted mainly of El Paso Brownware sherds (preferably rim sherds) collected from ceramic sites for
mineralogical tests and analysis of vessel style, shape, and
orifice diameter (see Appendix II).
Other ceramic samples were
removed when pottery types could not be accurately identified
in the field.
The general procedure was to collect six brownware sherds for technological analysis and a single specimen
of each unrecognized ceramic type.
Possible time-diagnostic
projectile points were collected for analysis when it was felt
that their removal would not impair the integrity of the
sites.
Other materials were only removed when there was some
question as to their identification.
For example, a small
amount of carbonized corn was collected from D-98, a sample of
faunal remains was taken when association with occupation could
be demonstrated, and non-utilitarian objects such as shell
ornaments were collected.
The basic philosophy of minimizing
damage to site integrity was applied consistently.
Any surface specimens removed from a site were bagged
and separately labeled with provenience data.
The samples were
shipped to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the
Balcones Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin.
CLASSIFICATION AND DATING
The areas of various sites have been tentatively
established by typological cross-dating, the prinicpal criteria
being observed pottery types (Appendix II).
Calendric

12

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

dates applied to the occupations are based on the dating of
cultural units from surrounding areas which contained similar
pottery types.
There are numerous limitations in dealing with
unstratified data derived totally from surface investigation.
In spite of these, information acquired from the intensive
surface inspections and subsequent laboratory analyses is
used to rank sites in chronological order.
The cultural
designations used here are based on the associations of the
latest materials, those found on the surface.
The resulting
calendric dates are tentative at best.
The assignment of ceramic-yielding sites to established
Jornada Branch phases is based upon a simplified chronology.
Only the well-established Mesilla and El Paso phases were
utilized.
Lehmer's (1948) transitional Dofta Ana Phase was
not retained in this analysis, because evidence gathered by
a surface survey is neither complete nor precise enough to
detect the subtle distinctions which mark this transitional
phase.
In her study of ceramic collections and observations
made during this reconnaissance, Smiley (Appendix II) has
retained, for reasons therein noted, the Dona Ana Phase
category.
Th~se
differences are felt to be of minor importance; however, the reader should be alert to this discrepancy.
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
THE PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The Paleoindian Period is considered the earliest
documented phase of human habitation in the Tularosa Basin.
It is represented by a nomadic lifeway in which a big-game
based subsistence was adapted to the environmental conditions
of the late Pleistocene. Archeologically, the culture is
evidenced by time-diagnostic projectile points termed Folsom,
which are often found in association with small relict playas in
the lower basin area (Human Systems Research 1973: 37; Beckes
and Dibble 1976: 11; Whalen 1977: 4).
Radiocarbon assays from
Folsom sites located in other areas of New Mexico and elsewhere date the culture to approximately 10,000 B.P. (Wormington
1957).
The Folsom tradition is believed to represent an outgrowth of the earlier Llano cultures, and is generally not
considered to represent any major change in the subsistence
base.
The local expression of this culture has been viewed
as a Plains tradition which was adapted to the late Pleistocene
environment of the Tularosa Basin due to changing climatic
conditions on the Great Plains (Human Systems Research 1973:
37; Beckes and Dibble 1976: 12).
The Folsom culture was followed by a series of human
groups often referred to collectively as Plano (Jennings 1956).
Residual traces of the Cody complex, which existed during the

BACKGROUND

13

late Plano period (approximately 8000 B.P.), have been recorded
in the Tularosa Basin.
The Cody tradition is characterized by
large lanceolate projectile points found along major stream
channels (Human Systems Research 1973: 37; Judge 1973: 245).
It has been suggested that the association of Cody sites with
more permanent water sources was a response to gradual
desiccation of the Pleistocene environment in this part of
the Southwest (Haynes 1965; Irwin-Williams and Haynes 1970).
Though no Paleoindian sites were identified during the
Doffa Ana surveys, early human occupation both on the Range and
throughout the basin area is documented by the recovery of
numerous Folsom, Folsom-like, and other lanceolate projectile
points (Quimby and Brook 1967: 31-47; Brook 1968: 11-15;
Russell 1968: 11-16; Davis 1975: 26-29; Drone 1975: 1-19;
Hedrick 1967; Beckes, Dibble and Freeman 1977).
Bishop's
Cap Cave (D-198), which may have been occupied during the
Paleoindian period, is located in the east-central section of
survey unit 43.
The site was originally investigated in the
late 1920's by the Los Angeles Museum (Bryan 1929), and
numerous Pleistocene fauna, possibly associated with human
skeletal remains, were recovered.
However, due to the general
lack of precise archeological controls, the casual documentation,
and the incomplete reporting of the site, the exact nature of
any early human associations at the cave must be considered
problematic.
A visit to Bishop's Cap Cave during this
reconnaissance produced no significant new information.
For
a detailed review of past investigations at this locality,
the reader is directed to Davis (1969).
The continued changing of post-Pleistocene environmental
conditions is assumed, and is accompanied by a succession of
varied human adaptations throughout the southwestern United
States.
These adaptations are evidenced by greater diversity
in subsistence patterns, perhaps reflecting the reduction of
exploitable Pleistocene fauna.
This stage of cultural development is generally referred to as the Archaic or Desert Archaic,
and dates from approximately 7000 to 2000 B.P.
It is characterized by a seasonal hunting and gathering subsistence pattern
with an emphasis on exploitable plant species.
ARCHAIC PERIOD
Archeological p·henomena generally ascribed to the Archaic
Period are not well defined or understood in southern New
Mexico.
The early development of Archaic cultures is generally
correlated with early post-Pleistocene climatic changes and
concomitant fluctuations in plant and animal populations (e.g.
Henderson 1976: 23).
These changes in exploitable floral and
faunal resources are viewed as the principal factor which
gradually led to the development of diverse hunting and gathering subsistence patterns throughout the Southwest during the
Archaic Period.

14

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

The Cochise culture has been described as a variant of the
Archaic tradition in southwestern New Mexico and Eastern
Arizona (Sayles and Antevs 1941), but has not been substantially
documented or precisely identified in the Tularosa Basin.
Archeological sites correlated with the Cochise complex are
characterized very generally by the occurrence of numerous
ground and chipped stone artifacts, including manos, metates,
milling stones, and large projectile points, and by the absence
of ceramic materials.
A recent survey of the McGregor Range (Beckes, Dibble and
Freeman 1977) resulted in the documentation of a variety of
sites which are assigned to the Archaic Period.
The sites are
described as small in extent but widely distributed throughout various physiographic zones (Beckes, Dibble, and Freeman
1977: 113).
Additional Archaic sites have been documented in
the mountains and high desert regions of the Hueco Balson
(Whalen 197 7).
Locally, the late Archaic is represented by manif~statians
which have been variously termed "Hueco Cave Dweller'' (Sayles
1935), "Hueco Basketmaker" (Cosgrove 1947), and "Hueco Phase"
(Lehmer 1948).
The Hueco Phase is documented in several caves
and rockshelters in the mountainous regions of the Tularosa
Basin and Hueco Balson (Roberts 1929; Mera 1938; Cosgrove
1947; Lehmer 1948; Lynn, Baskin and Hudson 1975; Lynn 1976;
Whalen 1977; and Beckes, Dibble, and Freeman 1977).
Such
materials have been interpreted by Lehmer (1948) as late Archaic
manifestations of the Cochise tradition and viewed as the
earliest development of the Jornada Branch of the Mogollon
culture.
Among the specific traits associated with the Hueco
Phase culture are coiled basketry, twined and twilled matting,
cotton cordage netting, and two-warp sandals.
Other artifacts
include atlatls, nocked cane darts with wood foreshafts, curved
fending sticks, bow fire drills, fireboards, and planting
sticks.
Numerous ground and chipped stone tools are also
associated with Hueco Phase cultures, and the presence of
twelve-row corn and squash remains is suggestive of a hunting
and gathering subsistence pattern supplemented at least
partially by agriculture (Lehmer 1948).
The general cultural pattern of the late Archaic Hueco
tradition seems to have continued in basically similar form
into the succeeding period.
However, some additions occur wfrich
are viewed as manifestations of early Mogollon culture.
The
principal identifiable traits which mark this transition are
the introduction of pottery and pithouse architecture (Sayles
and Antevs 1941: 61).
Based on reconnaissance and excavations in south-central
New Mexico and adjacent parts of Texas and Chihuahua, Mexico,
Lehmer (1948} defined the Jornada Branch as a regional
expression of Mogollon culture which extended from north of

BACKGROUND

15

Carrizozo, New Mexico, to ~outh of Villa Ahumada, Chihuahua,
Mexico, and from 75 miles west to 150 miles east of El Paso,
Texas.
Lehmer further divided the Jornada Branch into two
subareas, northern and southern, and proposed a four phase
sequence for each subarea, beginning with the Hueco Phase.
Within the southern subarea, which related directly to the
present study, Lehmer defined the Mesilla, Dona Ana and El
Paso Phases of the Mogollon culture.
Although some of Lehmer's
basic chronological or other assumptions concerning the Jornada
Branch, have been questioned, (see, for example, Wheat 1955;
Aten 1972; Human Systems Research 1973), his generalized
chronology of south-central New Mexico continues as the basic
statement on the late Archaic and Formative cultures in this
region.
Until such time as a regional resysthesis is formulated,
Lehmer's basic scheme will continue to form the skeletal basis
of regional culture history.
MESILLA PHASE
The Mesilla Phase represents the earliest known potterybearing, village-dwelling cultural complex in the southern
Jornada area - the earliest expression of emerging sedentism.
Developing out of the coalescence of the Hueco and San Marcila
patterns (Lehmer 1948: 74), the Mesilla Phase appears to have
begun by at least A.D. 600 (see Aten 1972: 13 and Beckes et
al. 1977: 28).
Mesilla Phase sites have been identified at hundreds of
localities throughout south-central New Mexico and adjacent
parts of Texas (see, for example, Lehmer 1948; Aten 1972;
Human Systems Research 1973; Lynn, Baskin and Hudson 1975;
Lynn 1976; Beckes and Dibble 1976; Beckes, Dibble, and Freeman
1977; Whalen 1977, 1978).
These sites have been recorded in
all major environmental zones, although Whalen (1977) has
suggested that Mesilla villages tend to be concentrated in the
Middle Desert, near the terminal borders of alluvial fans.
Mesilla settlements are characterized by two types of
pit house architecture, circular and rectangular.
Circular pit
houses contained roof entries, while rectangular structures
had inclined entries from the ground surface.
Features often
associated with the village sites included hearths, storage pits,
and scattered refuse rather than trash middens.
The ceramic
complex styles also begin to appear as an indigenous type during
this period.
Intrusive ceramics such as Mimbres Boldface and
Classic Black on White, Mimbres Corrugated, San Francisco Red,
and Alma Plain are occasionally found at these sites, indicating
at least some contact with the Mimbres region of the Western
Mogollon (Lehmer 1948}.

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

16

~

DONA ANA PHASE
The Dona Ana Phase was defined entirely on the basis of
surface collections and observations, which has resulted in
poor documentation of the period in the Jornada area.
It
developed directly out of the Mesilla Phase as a result of
increased contact with northern Anasazi groups, and Mimbres
groups already present in the area.
It has been considered as
a short-lived, transitional period of approximately 100 years
(A.D. 1100- 1200) between the Mesilla and El Paso phases
(Lehmer 1948: 89).
Distinguishing characteristics notea for the period
include adobe-walled surface structures with contiguous rooms
and a continuation of pit house structures.
Pottery types such
as El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black on White, Three Rivers
Red on Terracotta and St. Johns Polychrome are present, in
addition to the indigenous and intrusive types which first
appeared during the Mesilla Phase.
This increase of intrusive
pottery types during the Dofia Ana Phase is considered as
evidence of continuation and expansion of interaction and trade
among Jornada groups (Le~~ar 1948:· 79).
EL PASO PHASE
The final, and perhaps the most extensively documented,
period of the prehistoric sequence in the Tularosa Valley is
termed the El Paso Phase.
It is described as a crystallization
and intensification of the various traits which at first appeared during the preceding Dona Ana Phase (Lehmer 1948: 80).
The
phase has been further characterized as exhibiting greater
population densities, increased contact and trade from outside
groups, and an increasingly specialized agriculture and
collecting subsistence economy (Whalen 1977: 137-140 and Smiley
1977: 130).
Lehmer (1948) originally estimated that the El Paso Phase
had evolved by approximately A.D. 1200 and lasted approximately
200 years.
El Paso Phase sites have been documented throughout thE
Tularosa Basin and Hueco Balson, and many have been partially
excavated (see Moore 1947; Lehmer 1948; Brook 1966, 1967, 1970;
HEdrick 1967,. 1968; Schultz 1967; Human Systems Research 1973;
Lynn, Baskin and Hudson 1975; Lynn and Baskin 1975; Whalen 1977,
1978; Beckes et al.1977).
Archeologically, the period is recognized by the abandonment of pit houses, which were replaced by above-ground
rectilinear pueblos which vary in size from ten to more than
one hundred rooms.
The structures were usually arranged in
one of two basic ground plans - long tiers oriented east-west
or clusters around a central plaza - and in either case were
subject to sporadic additions,
Other features include more
elaborate food storage facilities, ceremonial structures, and
altars.

BACKGROUND

17

El Paso Polychrome is the dominant pottery type during
the period, but many intrusives (especially from northwest
Chihuahua) have been found in substantial quantities in El
Paso Phase sites,
Other intrusive ceramic types include
Chupadero Black on White, Three Rivers Red on Terracotta,
Lincoln Black on Red, Ramos Polychrome, Heshotauthla Glaze
Polychrome. Agua Fria Glaze on Red, Arenal Glaze Polychrome.
St. Johns Polychrome~ and Playas Red Incised (Lehmer 1948: 81).
By A.D. 1400 there was a noticeable contraction of
Mogollon communities in southern New Mexico.
Lehmer (1948:
87-88) suggests a terminal date of between A.D. 1375 and 1400
for the complete displacement of populat~ons in the Jornada
area.
Danson (1957: 110-120) estimates that the Mogollon
cultures in west-central New Mexico were gone by A.D. 1300
and Kelley (1966: 204-205) suggests that the Penasco Valley
in southeastern New Mexico was bare of sedentary villages by
about A.D. 1300.
Although a substantial amount of archeological
literature indicates that population shifts were widespread in
the Southwest during the 1300's, the exact nature of these
shifts and their causal relationships are not well documented.
Kelley (1952) argues that population shifts were the result
of ecological factors such as disastrous droughts or unpredictable rainfall patterns.
There is paleoenvironmental
data which indicates climatic fluctuations in the Southwest
during this time, although little which is applicable to
the immediate region.
THE ARCHEOLOGY
INTRODUCTION
The Dona Ana reconnaissance was primarily concerned with
locating and recording archeological sites in the 96 sample
quadrats, regardless of size, type, or amount (excluding
single artifact finds) of cultural material encountered.
Site
visibility was affected by two major factors, post-depositional
environmental changes such as migratory dune fields, and recent
human activity such as military traffic and maneuvers.
Although the project was limited to surface inspection without
the benefit of the additional information obtainable through
subsurface testing and excavation, it is nevertheless possible
to make general observations and suggestions.
Such observations
must be understood to be tentative, subject to support,
contradiction, or revision by additional testing.
The survey of the ninty-six units resulted in the
documentation of 198 prehistoric sites, (Table 1) many with
cultural residues suggestive of multiple occupations.
The sites
vary from small isolated rock hearths with few associated
artifacts to large village sites with exposed house remnants,

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

26

midden areas, and dense artifact scatters.
An additional
ten prehistoric sites were recorded during the preliminary
reconnaissance phase.
These sites will not be used in sample
quantification.
The survey data has not been intensively analyzed for
cultural component distributions, but certain general statements can be made concerning the types, sizes, distributions,
densities and relationships of prehistoric sites to aspects
of their physical environment.
The following discussion will
focus on five of those aspects.
Additional information concerning
the spatial and temporal relationships between prehistoric
settlements and the physical environment; with specific reference
to the Great Soil Groups and other geological features, is
included in Appendix I.
The following sections include some
data extracted from that appendix.
SITE TYPES
Sites-are assigned to classification units defined on the
basis of the variability and redundancy of quantitative and
qualitative attributes.
This approach is intended to isolate
recurrent patterns in site composition and_generate criteria
for estimating subsistence-settlement types.
The resulting
site types represent an attempt to distinguish between large
and small settlements as well as specialized activity camps
which may reflect the general pattern of exploitative and
maintenance strategies.
However, caution should be exercised
in reviewing the subsistence-settlement types.
The data on
which they were based was surficial investigation without
substantial testing of buried deposits.
Tremendous amounts of
natural and cultural displacement occur at some sites, often
resulting in serious alteration of exposed residues.
SITE ATTRIBUTES
With an awareness of the preceeding problems~ a set of
attributes including the presence or absence of house remnants,
other structural features, ceramics, chipped stone and ground
stone, as well as the areal extent of occupation, are identified
and compared among all recorded sites.
The following section
provides a brief summary of the attributes considered.
Presence or absence of house strpctures:
Empirical evidence for the presence of houses is limited
and based primarily on the noticeable round-to-rectang~lar depressions at several sites.
The association of house remnants
to depressed areas is demonstrated at a few vandalized sites,
where pot holes or oth~r disturbances have revealed buried
adobe walls.

THE ARCHEOLOGY

27

Presence or absence of other constructed features:
All features, including rock hearths, charcoal/ash
stained areas, and concentrated refuse middens, are counted,
described, measured and graphically recorded for comparative
studies.
Presence or absence of ceramics:
Pottery types were identified and densities estimated
in the field, and a small, selective sample collected.
Ceramic
densities were compared to a relative scale, in which very
light indicated a scatter with no exposed clusters or concentrations; light, a thin scatter with no exposed clusters of
sherds; moderate, a thin scatter of sherds with small dense
clusters in some areas; and h~avy, a scatter with both small
and large dense clusters of sherds.
Presence or absence of chipped stone:
Chipped stone tools were described and sketched in the
field.
Notes were compiled on tool types, debitage, densities,
and the lithic raw materials used in tool manufacturing.
Specimans potentially useful for dating purposes (e.g., projectile
points) were occasionally collected,
Additional chipped stone
samples were gathered from certain sites subsequent to establishment of site types (see the section on Lithic Artifacts).
Presence or absence of ground stone:
Ground stone tools include metates, milling stones, and
manos.
Notes were taken on their sizes, types, shapes, and
densities~and on the types of raw material represented.
Size:
The site type includes information on the maximum area
of the entire site as determined by the extent of exposed
cultural material.
Although areal extent was emphasized in
delineating various site types, it was not a primary consideration.
Some sites were so badly disrupted by military activities,
as well as natural erosion, that surface remnants were reduced
to charcoal stains and highly scattered ceramic and lithic
debris.
Precise measurement was often difficult in such
transformed conditions, and the figures presented are estimates.
This approach resulted in overlapping size ranges
for site types.

Large Complex Camps include a group of ceramic sites which
display continuous cultural residues of light to moderate density
over significant areas.
A high percentage of these sites
represent repeated intensive use of a locality throughout
ceramic and preceramic times.
Archeologically, these sites
are very similar in structure to Complex Camps, and were
presumably utilized by a large number of individuals as a
central focus of activities in a specific resource area during
particular seasons of the year.
The greatly increased areal
extent of Large Complex Camps is thought to result from repeated
reoccupation or shifting occupation at certain resource locales,
and not to denote an increase in population or a shift in
exploitation practices.
The size range of Complex Camps
probably reflects the actual extent of occupation at these sites.

Complex camps are large open sites thought to represent
multi-activity settlements where regional bands or large
groups converged at particular seasons or for extended periods
during the year.
Archeologically, they are represented by
numerous small hearths, large burned rock concentrations,
charcoal-ash pits, charcoal-ash stains, and diverse clusters
of specific artifact types.
Light to moderately dense scatters
of ceramics and/or lithic debitage often occur in discrete
clusters or concentrations.
Other common attributes are the
presence of numerous ground stone tools such as manos, metates
and other milling stones, the relatively high frequency of
chipped stone artifacts, and the absence of any recognizable
architectural remnants.
This type is consistent with Beckes' Complex Camps (Beckes,
Dibble and Freeman 1977), and includes Whalen's HaIDlets and
Small Villages (Whalen 1977:21).

This catagory includes small, open, temporary camps, presumably occupied briefly by small groups of individuals engaged
in hunting, food gathering, and limited processing of resources.
Small Camps are characterized by:
the presence of one or more
small burned rock concentrations or charcoal stains, presumably
displaced hearths; the low frequency of ceramic and/or lithic
debris; the presence of ground stone artifacts; the presence
of diverse chipped stone tool types, including unifaces such
as modified flakes, blades, and small scrapers; the presence of
bifaces, pebble and core tools, and occasional projectile points.
It is important to note that the chipped and ground stone
artifacts are sparse, never occurring in discrete clusters or
small concentrations.
The artifact assemblage is suggestive of
a smaller range and shorter duration of activities than at
Complex Camps.
Except for the addition of ground stone tools, tfLis type is

The Isolated Hearth site category includes both ceramic
and nonceramic, small, open, transient camps, presumably
occupied by a few individuals involved in a minimal range of
activities.
Isolated Hearths include sites that may only be
partially eroded, as well as what may be eroded portions of
larger and perhaps more complex sites.
The Isolated Hearth site
type is characterized by one, or occassionally a few, small
clusters of fire-cracked rock and/or charcoal-ash stains
which are interpreted as displaced hearths; associated sparse

scatters of ceramics and lithic debris; the absence of ground
stone tools.
Stone artifacts are uncommon, but the few that
were found were flakes, hammerstones, and exhausted cores.
This site type is consistent with Beckes' Isolated Hearth
type (Beckes, Dibble and Freeman 1977), and somewhat more
restrictive of site attributes than Whalen's Small Camps
(1977:21).

This site category consists of a single, small, isolated
scatter of ceramic sherds.
The pottery is not thought to reflect
an isolated chance breakage, (such features w~re not recorded
by the survey team but were noted in the daily journal) ·due
to the light density of sherds occurring.on the.surface.
The
exposed pottery may reflect a larger occupation which has
sustained some structural integrity and is now beginning to be
revealed by active deflation.
Archeologically, ceramic scatters
are composed of pottery, with no recognizable evidence of other
cultural remnants.

Lithic Scatters represent a site type characterized by
diffuse scatters of stone artifacts and manufacturing debitage.
These sites seem to have been occupied hy varying numbers of
individuals on a temporary, opportunistic basis for specialized
activities ranging from procurement and initial reduction of
lithic raw materials for stone tool industries (chipping
stations), to preceramic transient hunting and gathering ca,mps.
They are recognized by light to moderate densities of chipping
debitage, cores, hammerstones, and in some instances a, variety
of chipped stone tools, including dart-type projectile points,
Pottery, ground stone, architectural remnants, and other
cultural features are never found at these sites,
Lithic Scatters
are identical to Beckes' Lithic Scatters (Beckes, Dibble and
Freeman 1977).
No comparable site type is presented by Whalen.

These sites seem to have resulted from temporary encampments by small groups involved in a limited range of
specialized activities.
However, the absence of recognizable
cultural features at Ceramic/Chipped Stone Scatters may be due
to such features not having been exposed to erosion.
Archeologically, this type of site is identified on the
basis of sparse scatters of pottery and lithic material,

A single cave site, commonly known as Bishop's Cap Cave
(Davis 1969), is located along the eastern edge of survey unit
43.
The site is believed to represent a sink-hole and tunnel
cave formed by water-generated erosion.
Previous investigations
at the cave resulted in the recovery of human skeletal remains
in association with extinct Pleistocene fauna (Davis 1969).
At present, surficial evidence is insufficient to document
aboriginal occupation at the site,
The type is consistent with Beckes' Cave/Rockshelter
(Beckes, Dibble and Freeman 1977) and Whalen's Cave and Rockshelter site type (Whalen 1977).
SITE SITUATIONS
Prehistoric sites were encountered in six geomorph~c
situations; distal coalesced fans (bajadas), proximal coalesced
fans, sand dunes, sand ridges, caves and mountain outliers
(spurs) (Table 3).
The majority (143) were found in association
with sand dunes which extend throughout the southern Tularosa
Valley.
These dunes are partially stabilized and generally less
than three meters in height.
The dominant plant species are
mesquite, yucca, and snakeweed.
Sites found in sand dunes
are frequently associated with small, ephemeral drainways
and/or playas.
Figure 9 graphically illustrates that both
Mesilla Phase and Nonceramic sites are heavily concentrated
in sand dunes while El Paso Phase sites are more evenly distributed among sand dunes, sand ridges, and distal coalesced
fans.
This distributional pattern is discussed further in the
section on site distributions.

Twenty-five sites (12.6 percent of all sites located) were
encountered in association with sand ridges.
These sand
ridges occur throughout the range, but tend to be concentrated
in the north-central and north-eastern sections.
They are
prominent physiographic features, elevated well above the
surrounding coppice dune fields and of ten visible as far as a
kilometer away.
Generally, these features were somewhat
linear and oriented on a north-south axis.

Dominant vegetation associated with sand ridges includes
Yucca ela ta, d rap seed (Sporobol us spp.), and various grasses
such as grama (Bouteloua spp.).
Botanical studies in areas
adjacent to Dona Ana Range have indicated that dropseeds are
restricted to areas of moist soil accumulations (Kenmotsu &
Pigott 1977:10).
Pedogenic studies (Appendix I) suggest that
sand ridges may represent isolated exposures of calciorthid
paleosols in the desert lowlands.
These paleosols retain much of
their original character and are considered to be remnants of
an environment which has been relatively stable since the last
pluvial.

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

Sand ridges situated within sample quadrats are consistently
characterized by prehistoric occupational residues in which
the same types of debris are present in varying quantities.
Cultural materials observed at these sites included burned
rock fragments, flake scrapers, large flake tools, ground stone
tools, and generally a few pottery sherds.
These materials
were found either on the surf ace or just below the surface
under a thin layer of sand.
The function of these sites is
not known, but they may have served as temporary, perhaps
specialized, camps for collecting edible plants and seeds from
the immediate area.
The buried sites indicate that these landforms were actively accreting subsequen~ to prehistoric
occupations.
The sand ridge sites are some of the best
examples of partially preserved sites observed in the desert
lowlands.
A single large Chipped Stone Scatter (D-51) was found in
a mountain outlier between the Organ and Franklin Mountains.
The site contained an abundance of chipped-stone debitage
indicative of stone tool manufacturing.
Both black chert and
gray silicious limestone were available at the site.
Two prehistoric sites (D-101 and D-102) were located at
the proximal ends of alluvial fans on the southwestern side
of the Organ Mountains.
These locations afford easy access to
both the mountain canyons and th~ lower valley, and the sites
may represent temporary hunting camps.
Both sites contained
large, dart-like projectile points believed to be of the
Archaic tradition.
The well known Bishop's Cap Cave (D-198) is the only Cave
or Shelter site observed during the survey,
The nature of human
utilization of the site remains clouded (see Davis 1969).
Recent investigations of the cave resulted only in the docu~
mentation of a few chert flakes of unknown context.
Numerous
other caves and rock shelters encountered in Finley and Long
canyons were investigated, but most had bedrock floors and
contained no evidence of prehistoric use.
A total of 26 sites, or 13.2 percent of those found, were
along the distal portions of coalesced fans of the Organ,
Franklin and Jarilla mountains,
These sites consist mainly of
Large Complex Camps and Village Complexes,
Sites found along
the distal fans are predominantly associated with Mesilla and
El Paso Phase occupations (Figure 9}.
The concentration of
more permanently occupied sites along the fans is thought to
reflect the availability of water.
This situation will be
discussed in greater detail in the section on site distribution,
which follows.
The association of site situations with identified phases
and nonceramic sites suggests that both_ Mesilla Phase and
Nonceramic resources are, to a high degree, clustered in sand
dune settings, while later El Paso Phase communities exhibit
more even di st ri but ion among the three major location al

settings (Figure 9, Table 4).
A chi-square test (Nie et al. 1975)
was performed to determine the statistical significance of this
seemingly nonrandom association of sites with their settings.
To simplify the testing, only the three major topographic
situations were utilized as variables.
These were Sand Dunes,
Sand Ridges, and Distal Coalesced Fans.
Caves, Mountain
Outliers, and Proximal Coalesced Fans were omitted due to the
excessively low frequency and/or absence of settlements associated with these settings.
The results of ch~.-squa,r e analysis.
demonstrate
that sites are not randomly distributed but i~
fact are highly associated {X 2 =35.2,4DF,P=.0001} with situation
variables.

The evidence suggests a .lllaj or shift in settlement locations,
from predominately sand dune situations during the Archaic
to increased utilization of coalesced fans and sand ridges
during the succeeding Mesilla and El Paso phases.
Sampling
error may, of course, account for a degree of this variation.
However, the shift becomes even more apparent in light of the
fact that not all Nonceramic sites are attributable to the
Archaic Period.
This is especially true of Sand Ridge sites,
which were often only partially exposed in rills and tankgenerated erosional areas.
Within the limits of this reconnaissance level study, it
was not possible to test for explanations of this settlement
pattern.
There seems little doubt, however, that it is related
to economic and subsistence factors and reflects a cultural
adjustment to environmental changes.
It may be shown that the shift is a direct response to
changes in settlement subsistence strategies; in any event
the issue should be subjected to critical testing.
Archaic
culture, and most Nonceramic sites encountered here are considered to be of Archaic age, is characterized by a huntinggathering subsistence strategy totally dependent on the
availability of natural resources.
Later Formative cultures
incorporated agriculture into their economy, which probably
reduced their need to extract additional resources.
It seems

clear, at least, that changes in these basic economic s.ys t ems
are reflected on the Dona Ana Range by variations in the site
setting over time.
Therefore, it is recommended that studies
related to these questions be continued with any further
archeological investigations.
PHYSIOGRAPHIC ZONES
Dona Ana Range can be readily divided into several discrete
physiographic areas - the Organ Mountains, Franklin Mountains,
Jarilla Mountains, coalesced alluvial fans and desert lowlands.
However, virtually all of the mountainous areas were excluded
from our sample by the elimination of the impact zone from the
survey area.
As a result, it is only possible to present
any interpretations of site density and distribution witlLin the
two physiographic zones open for study, the coalesced fans and
the desert lowlands (Figure 11).
These two terrain types exhibit sharply defined topography with distinct ecological
associations, and the frequency of sites in these areas is
believed to reflect variation in prehistoric subsistence
adaptation throughout the cultural developmental stages.
These variations in subsistence also provide tlLe primary data
for recognition of settlement types.
Although this discussion
is tentative at best, the investigation of th_ese two terrain
types was sufficient to allow preliminary statements concerning
the types and densities of prehistoric sites,

The coalesced fans physiographic area is restricted to
the eastern side of the Organ Mountains.
It includes only
the area from War Highway II west to the Impact Area.
The
zone extends to the northern boundary line of Dona Ana Range
and south to the intersection of War Highway II with th£
Impact Area.
It does not include the southern coalesced fan
areas because of the environmental variation there as a result
of the convergence of two mountain regions and the rather
extensive military-generated surface modification.
The zone
includes approximately 45 square kilometers of which 7 square
kilometers (15.5%) were investigated.
The Tularosa Valley floor (desert lowlands) includes
only those areas extending east from War Highway II to State
Highway 54, the eastern limit of the range,
It extends north
and south to the range boundary lines but does not include a
.small section of the Jarilla Mountains coalesced alluvial fans
in the extreme northeastern section of the range.

lowlands encompass appro~imately 780 square kilometers in
which seventy-three kilometer-square quadrats (9.3%} were
surveyed.
Specific data concerning archeological resources identified
in these two major physiographic zones, as well as properties
recorded in the remaining terrain, are contained in Tables 5-7.
SITE DISTRIBUTION
An analysis of reconnaissance sampling data indicates
that prehistoric sites are not randomly distributed across th£
range.
A review of Figures 12 and 13 indicates a close correlation between defined archeological site types and their
physiographic settings.
This situation is most dramatic with
the large Village Complex sites wh~ch exhibit evidence of
habitational structures, direct or inferred evidence of agriculture, and substantial indications of intensive occupation.
All of these sites were found either along the distal ends
of coalesced fans extending east from the Organ Mountains, or
in areas immediately adjacent to the fans in the vicinity of
the Old Coe Lake basin (Fig 9 & 10},
The large habitational
sites in our sample were restricted to areas of potentially
arable land with proximate water sources and calciorthid soils.
No direct evidence of water control structures was found
during our reconnaissance,
The distal portions of coalesced fans fronting the eastern
flanks of the Organ Mountains are composed of sands, silts,
and gravels.
Calciothids are the major soil group.
Vegetation
is sparse and dominated by the creosotebush-tarbush association,
with mesquite also scattered throughout this area.
It has
been suggested that runoff from mountainous regions may be
concentrated along the lower coalesced fans (Rack 1941}, making
these areas suitable for water control and agriculture.
Adjacent to the coalesced alluvial fans are the desert
lowlands, consisting mainly of sands and sand dunes classified
largely as Torripsamments (see Appendix l}.
Vegetation in
this area consists mainly of the mesquite-saltbuslL-broom
snakeweed association, with yucca and sand sage also represented.
The lower desert regions are ch.aracterized by numerous small
drainways and scattered playa lakes of varying sizes.
These
playas are located at lower elevations, and historic accounts
have indicated that these features retained water during
periods of excessive rainfall,
The general association of large lLabitation sites with
distal alluvial fans and adjacent portions of tlLe desert
lowlands has been noted during several recent archeological
investigations in south central New Mexico (see Beckes and
Dibble 1976; and Beck~s, Dibble and Freeman 1977; 1978}.
The
association may reflect environmental conditions wlLich were
suited for habitation by people whose economy was oriented
at least partially toward agriculture,

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

to an agricultural economy in these areas are the availability
of water, arable lands, and locally calciorthid soils.
In the lower desert area the predominate site types are
Small Camps, Complex Camps, and Isolated Hearth Sites.
These
sites usually contain small-to-moderate surface scatters of
chipped and ground stone artifacts; 51% of these yielded
ceramics.
These sites were often associated with_ small drainways or playas as well as other areas where no water source
was recognizable.
The absence of evidence of proximate water
sources at camp sites may reflect the transient nature of
these occupations ("dry camps"), or perhaps environmental
changes may have masked previously usable water sources.
Large Complex Camps are about equally represented in the
coalesced fans and the desert lowlands.
These sites always
occur in close proximity to water sources, suggesting that
they were occupied on a more permanent basis than the smaller
camp sites.
Complex camps located on the alluvial fans are
associated with major drainways, and those recorded in the
desert lowlands are always found near large playas.
A chi-square analysis was performed to assist in a statistical evaluation of the relationship between site types and
physiographic zones (Table 8).
This type of analysis again
strongly suggests that site types are not randomly distributed
throughout the various physiographic zones {X 2 ~144.2,DF16,
P=.0001}.
The results of th~s analysis seem to indicate
that certain settlement types are associated with specific
environmental features.
In summary, the surficial evidence indicates that the
desert lowlands, which were apparently unfavorable for agriculture because of a lack of arable land and adequate water,
are characterized predominately by small, ephemeral camp sites.
The distal coalesced fans, which were suitable for agriculture,
exhibited extensive evidence of Village Complex sites suggestive
of sedentary occupation by Formative groups,
A series of contingency tables (Tables 9, 10, 11} were
prepared to express possible correlations of site types with
identified cultural phases and to provide preliminary indications of how these might relate to settlement distributional
patterns within the two major physiographic zones,
These
cross tabulations indicate that there is some degree of
correlation between the site types represented by the various
cultural phases and their distribution within the major physiographic zones.
Again, it is important to remember that sampling
of all the major zones was not equal.
(see section on Physiographic Zones).
Therefore, data presented here are only a
preliminary indication of the variation in distributional
patterns of identified settlements.
The results of this computation are briefly summarized below:
(l} Nonceramic (Archaic) settlements identified in this
study are most prominent in the Tularosa Valley desert lowlands
area (92.9%), and are totally absent from the coalesced fan,

(2) Mesilla Phase settlements identified during the
reconnaissance are concentrated in the desert lowlands Ca3,3%},
with the balance occurring in the coalesced fans, Organ 'Mountains region (12. 5%). Mesilla sites in the desert lowland
areas consist mainly of Complex Camps (21) and Small Camps (21}
which represent 70 percent of Mesilla Ph.ase occupations identified in the Tularosa Valley Floor physiographic zone. Mesilla
communities recorded in the coalesced fan, Organ Mountains
area are evenly represented by Complex Camps (2), Small Camps (2),
Isolated Hearths (2), and Ceramic/Chipped Stone Scatters (2}.
A single Village Complex site is also present.
(3)
El Paso Phase settlements display a somewhat more
even distribution, with 68.3 percent identified in the desert
lowlands and 24.4 percent recorded in the coalesced fans, Organ
Mountains.
The settlement types in the desert lowlands are
predominately Complex Camps (6} and Small Camps (11} which,
taken together, account for 60.7 percent of the El Paso Phase
sites in this region.
Site types found in the coalesced fans
of the Organ Mountains area consisted mainly of Village Complexes
(7), which represent 70 percent of the settlements identified
in the zone.

Further, it demonstrates that settlement types change through

However, additional information is

SITE SIZE
A review of Table 12 indicates that while th.e areal extent
of the identified cultural resources increases through time,
the frequency of settlements decreases in each successive
developmental stage.
Although Nonceramic (probably Archaic}
sites totaled 85 (representing 42.9 percent of all identified
sites), these settlements only account for 11.6 percent
(68.2 ha,) of the combined occupational area represented by our
sample.
Archeological sites assigned to the subsequent Mesilla
Phase total 72, which represents 36.7 percent of the total.
Mesilla Phase settlements exhibit a combined occupational
area of 186.6 hBctares , or 31.7 percent of all site area,
Forty-one encampments, or 20.7 percent of the recovered resources,

The inverse correlation between settlement frequency and
occupational area is believed to reflect changes in demographic
structure over time.
It has been suggested that population will
increase in proportion to the available food resources.
Assuming
that agricultural innovations which occurll!ed .during th_e tran-sition from Archaic to Formative cultural traditions resulted
in an increase in foodstuffs, it could be inferred that local
population densities increased as resources became more
plentiful.
The converse has also been proposed - that increased
population pressure forced technological advances and intensification or diversification in food acquisition ~oserup 1965}.
According to the latter interpretation, a gradually increasing
population density, straining the traditionally exploited
resources of the region, could have triggered agricultural
innovations which led to an increased food supply.
It is obvious that there are many other factors involved
in this process.
They might include birth and death rates as
they relate to technological innovations, external pressures
from surrounding communities, trade, climatic fluctuations,
the availability of needed resources, and numerous other conditions encompassing both economic and organizational continuity
and change.
Many of these other factors will need to be
identified and =studied before the interaction of cause and
effect can be unraveled in a case such as that of Dona Ana
Range.
As occupational units (villages?) increased in size and
site frequency decreased through time, the sample indicates
a concomitant shift in their geographical distributions.
Figure 14 illustrates that settlements in the coalesced fans
of the Organ Mountains region, which are all Formative, are
generally greater than five hectares in areal extent, while some
are as large as 50 hectares (Table 12}.
Conversely. the
Formative and Nonceramic sites in the Tularosa Valley floor
area generally encompass less than 0.26 hectares each.

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

During the discussions of settlement distribution~ it was
noted that Mesilla Phase groups included distal coalesced fans
within their occupation range. Utilization of this zone
became most prominent in the succeeding El Paso Phase.
This
locational strategy was apparently accompanied by the establishment of fewer, .but significantly larger, settlements.
Such a
pattern is thought to reflect a gradual increase in exploitive
domains by Formative groups, and to suggest that the expansion
into these areas correlated with increased technological
efficiency, especially with regard to food production and/or
availability.
This ·acquisition of additional resources may
have resulted from innovations in agricultural technology or
in other food procurement activities, or from the development
of more effective means of processing, transporting and storing
food.
Whatever the causes, it is probable that a change in
food production technology is somehow related to the observed
increase in settlement unit size over time.
CULTURAL FEATURES
EXPOSED CONSTRUCTION REMAINS
The following sections provide information on the types
and characteristics of exposed cultural features encountered
during survey investigations.
BURNED ROCK HEARTHS (Fig. 15a)
These concentrations of fire fractured rock were observed
at most sites throughout the survey.
They took one of four
basic forms - small burned rock concentrations, small rocklined circles or donut-shaped h~arths, large burned rock
concentrations, and large contiguous scatters of fire fractured
rock.
SMALL BURNED ROCK HEARTHS
Shape: Circular, relatively flat to slightly basinshaped, compacted concentrations of heat-altered stones.
Size: Generally less than 1 meter diameter.
Materials used in construction: Limestone, igneous rocks,
and some silicates.
Occurrence: Present at all sixes e.xce.pt: D-6, 9, 10, 16,
18, 22, 23, 26, 27, 39-43, 45, 46, 51, 52, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63,
69, 72, 79, 80, 81, 88, 95, 96, 101-142, 144, 145, 147, 151,
153, 154, 158-160, 163, 164, 174-177, 180, 183-185, 197.
Comments: Often associated with charcoal-ash stains.

CULTURAL FEATURES

63

LARGE BURNED ROCK llEA:RTRS
Shape: Circular, flat, highly compacted concentrations of
fire-fractured stone.
Size: Between 1 and 3 meters in diameter.
Materials used in construction: Limes-tone, igneous rocks,
and some silicates.
Occurrence: D-4, 29, 62, 68, 71, 74, 87, 93, 94, 97, 98,
100, 133, 168, 172, 173, 182.
CHARCOAL AND ASH STAINS:

(Fig. 15c)

Concentrations of charcoal and ash were observed in two
forms: flat to slightly basin-shaped stains found on the surface,
and deep pits exposed in sand dunes and cut-bank profiles,
Many charcoal/ash stains represent the remnants of eroded
rock hearth features, but others presumably resulted from earth
ovens.
Shape: Round to oval and flat to basin-shaped.
Size: Generally greater than 1 meter in diameter.
Occurrence: D-26, 27, 30, 43, 54, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 68,
80, 81, 87, 91, 93, 96, 97, 98, 108, 113, 115, 117, 127, 128,
135, 144, 160, 174, 175, 176, 189.
RABBIT-ROASTING PITS
These are surface-exposed high density concentrations of
rabbit bones, many of which display evidence of charring.
Shape: Surface exposures are generally circular and somewhat dome-shaped.
Size: Between 1 and 2 meters in diameter.
Occurrence: D-87, D-98.
Comments: Several of these features had been destroyed by
pot hunting.
Examination of these subsurface exposures revealed that the fractured skeletal remains are contained in a somewhat basin-shaped pit which contains large quantities of
charcoal ash matrix.
Profiles indicated that the faunal
remains were very compacted in dense layers interspersed with
charcoal and ash.
Dense concentrations of chipped stone
debitage and pottery sherds were exposed in the back dirt
from the vandalized features.
HOUSE REMNANTS (Fig. lOd)
Surface evidence for suspected house structures consists
of large basin-shaped depressions with a distinctive concentration of cultural refuse piled around the outer edges of
the depressed areas.
Pueblo structures are occassionally
visible.
Shape: Outline is semi-circular to rectangular.

Size: Variable, from 5 to 10 meters in diameter.
Materials used in construction: Packed Adobe.
Occurrence: D-71, 74, 84, 87, 98, 99, 100, 116, 68, 117.
CAIRNS
The single rock cairn found during the survey consisted of
unidentified, unaltered igneous stones piled in circular domeshaped fashion.
Shape: Circular, dome-shaped.
Size: Approximately 2 meters in diameter.
Materials used in construction: Ind~terminate.
Occurrence: D-102.
Comments: In areas surrounding Dona Ana Range, rock cairns
often cover prehistoric burials.
No such association could be determined from the surface
investigation at D-102.
TRASH MIDDENS
These generally consisted of concentrated refuse such as
charcoal, ash, pottery sherds, chipped stone debitage and
burned rock.
Vegetal and animal remains were occasionally
represented.
Trash middens presumably represent areas where
subsistence and maintenance byproducts and residues were
dumped.
Shape: Variable, occurring in basin-shaped, donut fashion,
or semi-circular to rectangular and dome-shaped heaps.
Size: Variable, from 4 square meters to over 15 square
meters.
Occurrence: D-87, D-98.
STONE ARTIFACTS
CHIPPED AND GROUND STONE ARTIFACTS
The following sections provide brief descriptions of the
types of artifacts observed or collected from the prehistoric
sites.
The typological system used for the descriptions is
based primarily on morphological characteristics inherent in
each specimen.
(see White, Binford and Papworth 1963; Steward
1954).
The classification system does rely on some degree of
subjective judgment, but is thought to be best suited for
comparative purposes.
Only diagnostic projectile points were
collected; the other lithic categories ~escribed are compiled
from field observations and recording.
PROJECTILE POINTS
A total of twenty-two projectile points were collected

Stem consists of two barbs that extend downward and slightly
out from the neck.
Base is concave or indented. Materials
used include obsidian, chert, and chalcedony.
Comments:
Group I specimens strongly resemble the type described
by Suhm and Jelks (1962: 227) as Paisano.
The type is
associated with the Chisos focus (approximately 800 - 1200 A.D.)
in the Big Bend region of Texas.
Similar points have also
been reported form McGregor Range, (Beckes et al. 1977: Fig.

DEBITAGE CATEGORIES
DEBITAGE
Debitage refers to the by-products or residual material
that results from stone tool manufacturing.
This residual
material includes exhausted or discarded cores, flakes, chips,
chunks, and shatter.
CORES
A mass of lithic raw material used in a reduction process
for removal of flakes and/or blades.
No distinction was made
between types of cores such as residual and nucleus.
FLAKES
Any piece of stone that has been removed from a larger mass
by the application of percussion techniques, exhibits a bulb
of percussion and striking platform, and is not a blade.
May
be any size or shape depending on techniques employed during
detachment.

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE
SUMMARY

PALEO INDIAN
Early Man investigations on McGregor Range, located immediately east of Doiia Ana, concluded that,
Th~ deflated condition of Folsom component sites
examined thus far greatly reduces their potential
data yield from excavation, (Beckes and Dioble 1976: 11)
Whalen, conducting intensive surveys over 100 percent of
Maneuver Area II, located southeast of the present study,
concluded that,
• the scanty artifactual evidence demonstrates
th_e presence of Paleo~Indian occupation in and
around the survey area, althnug& very little is
known ab.out the whole way of life of these early
___ grou_ps" 0977: 6). ______
_ ___________________ --------Evidence of Paleoindian occupations on Dona Ana Range is
also very limited, and is based solely on information obtained
from local amateur groups.
This evidence consists entirely
of time-diagnostic projectile points and other reportedly Paleoindian artifacts recovered from two sites, El Paso Archeological
Society Numbers 110 and 114.
In each case, the site is situated
on a prominent physiographic feature overlooking a large playa
lake.
One site (EPAS 110) is located on the east side of Old
Coe Lake; the other lies on eroded sections of the east Franklin
Mountains coalesced fans just west of Steward Lake.
Plainview
projectile points were recovered from the Coe Lake site.
The
presence of this material indicates that the human use of the
range extends back approximately 10,000 years, although only
the most general statements can be made about the ancient lifeways represented.
There is some concern over the possibility that Bishop's
Cap Cave (D-198) contains human skeletal remains in association
with extinct Pleistocene megafauna (Bryan 1929). However, the
association remains questionable (Davis 1969), and a surficial
reinvestigation of the cave during this study did not produce
any relevant data.
No evidence of Paleoindian culture was discovered during the investigations reported here.
The presence of Early Man encampments on Dona Ana would
certainly seem predictable in view of evidence generated by
regional surveys in areas contiguous to the Range (see Human
Systems Research 1973; Beckes and Dibble 1976; Beckes, Dibble
and Freeman 1977; Whalen 1977).
Evidence gathered thus far
suggests that Paleoindian sites in the Tularosa Basin are
generally small in extent.
These sites appear to be short
duration camps or limited activity loci seasonally occupied by
a few individuals involved in specialized activities such as
hunting (Beckes and Dibble 1976; Whalen 1977).
Beckes and Dibble
have suggested that Paleoindian sites are associated with
relict lakes in the vicinity of McGregor Range.
The data

----

SUMMARY

87

collected by local amateurs from early man sites on Dona Ana
tends to support this association.
To date, no evidence of
extensive base camps has been documented in the Tularosa Basin.
The small amount of information that is available is usually
interpreted from scattered isolated surf ace finds which exist
in a secondary depositional context and are not conducive to
systematic investigation.
The possibility that Bishop's Cap Cave (D-198) contains
stratified evidence of the presence of early human populations
in the Tularosa Valley should be sufficient to warrent protection
of this site.
Although the present study could not demonstrate
the potential of the cave deposits for vroducing quality data,
it did reveal that the site is presently suffering from vandalism.
Until further investigations can provide the type of information
necessary for adequate evaluation of the site, it should be
placed off-limits to all personnel, both civilian and military.
ARCHAIC
Recent archeological studies in the Tularosa Basin have
documented numerous occupations which contain material attributed to Archaic cultures (Human Systems Research 1974; Beckes
and Dibble 1976; Whalen 1977).
This evidence seems to reflect
a significant increase in the utilization of the region during
that period of cultural development.
However, the state of
knowledge concerning the Archaic Period in the Tularosa Basin
region has not progressed much more rapidly than that concerning
Paleoindian cultures.
For example, Whalen conducted archeological studies of
preceramic components in the Hueco Balson and concluded that,
"All too little continues to be known about preceramic settlement s in t he Hue c o Bo 1 s on .
. " (1 9 7 7 : 1 3 7 } .
Wh a 1 en f u r t her
concludes that, ".
. Nothing can be added at this time to
extant understanding of Archaic society" (1977:143).
Recently
Beckes and Dibbie (1976) have emphasized the need for regional
chronologies which would both enable more precision in the
identification of Archaic residues and provide a sound foundation
for the development of hypotheses.
The information void was
especially evident during the present study; it was soon
realized that the presence of dart-type projectile points was
not an absolute indicator of Archaic remains.
Dart points were occasionally found on Formative stage
sites.
Such sites are dominated by ceramic industries, and
surface evidence does not indicate multiple occupations.
As a
result, all nonceramic sites not attributable to either Paleoindian or Formative Mogollon culture were put into a generalized
Nonceramic category.
Most of these sites probably date to the
Archaic period, but the general lack of time-diagnostic
artifacts precludes dependable interpretation of cultural
affinity.
For these reasons, we stress the need for regional

88

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

chronologies during future studies of Archaic sites located on
Dona Ana Range.
Table 2 indicates that of the 198 prehistoric sites identified in the present study, eighty five percent were assigned
to the Nonceramic category,
The majority of these sites are
believed to be Archaic, although some may represent Paleoindian
residues or specialized Formative stage encampments.
In any
event, surface-exposed materials were not sufficient to allow
truly confident placement of these sites into an existing
chronological framework.
Nonceramic sites are predominately Isolated Hearths (35}
and Small Camps (33) , which account for '8 0 percent of the
represented site types.
These localities generally exh~bit a
few hearth features and an extremely low frequency of timediagnostic artifacts.
Such sites may represent plant processing
stations.
Eleven Complex Camps were found which contained
numerous hearths, artifacts including several tool categories,
and moderate amounts of lithic reduction debitage,
Five Chipped
Stone Scatters were recorded which exhibited no hearths but
contained numerous chipped stone tools with associated debitage.
One previously documented Cave site was reinvestigated during
the study.
Rock hearths are the major structural features at Nonceramic
sites.
Most hearths are less than one meter in diameter,
although some were as large as three meters in diameter,
The
larger hearths were only observed at Complex Camp sites.
Limestone was commonly used to construct hearths, but rhyolite, sandstone, and other materials were also used.
Charcoal and ash
stains are present and most of these appear to be displaced
hearth remnants, although a few may be earth ovens or other such
features.
The only other cultural feature recognized is a
possible rock cairn recorded at D-102.
ThB function of the cairn
could not be determined.
Chipped stone artifacts observed at Nonceramic sites are
predominately flake tools exhibiting modification along one or
more of the lateral edges.
Although no count was kept, it
appeared that a high percentage of the flake tools were ovoid
in outline with modification restricted to the dorsal side
opposite the bulb of percussion.
Other chipped stone artifacts
include dart-type projectile points, thin bifaces (knives?),
thick bifaces (chopper tools?}, scrapers, gravers, denticulates,
.and drills.
All debitage categories are recognized at these
sites.
Materials used included a variety of cherts, rhyolites,
limestones, siliceous shales, obsidians, quartzes, quartzites,
dolomites, jaspers, and chalcedonys, as well as numerous others.
It was noted that the variety of lithic raw materials at Nonceramic sites seemed to far exceed that found at occupations
which yielded pottery.
This diversity in raw materials at
Nonceramic sites may reflect a greater emphasis on lithic
technology.
While Formative stage occupations generally
utilized stone materials available in close proximity to the

SUMMARY

89

sites, some of the sources for the lithic material found at
Nonceramic localities have yet to be identified.
Ground stone tools, scarce at Nonceramic sites, generally
consist of flat milling slabs roughly shaped from limestone.
A few displayed some evidence of intentional shaping, but they
seldom took on the appearance of metates.
Hammerstones and
manos were also noted.
Seventy-five percent of the eighty-five Nonceramic sites
occur in sand dune situations, with an additional four encampments located in the sand ridges which are restricted to the
desert lowlands.
Ninty-three percent of the identified Nonceramic sites are in the desert lowlands, which may reflect
a well-defined desert settlement for Archaic groups.
This is not
intended to suggest that the upland areas were not included
in the Archaic settlement system.
Previous studies in the
immediate area have demonstrated that the mountainous zones
included Archaic sites (Beckes and Dibble 1976; Beckes, Dibble
and Freeman 1977; Whalen 1977).
Further, it must be remembered
that most of the mountainous portion of Dona Ana Range was
restricted and so unavailable for reconnaissance,
However, it
does appear that the desert lowlands were a major focus of
activity during the Archaic Period.
The six sites not located
in the desert lowlands include one Complex Camp (distal coalesced
fans, Jarilla Mountains), four Chipped Stone Scatters ~hree coalesced fans, Organ Mountains and one Mountain outlier), and
Bishop's Cap Cave (Organ Mountains).
Although nonceramic occupations predominate (42.9 percent)
in this inventory of prehistoric sites, they account for only
11.6 percent (68.l ha.) of the combined occupational area
(see Table 12).
The density of nonceramic sites is greatest in
the desert lowland, with 1.1 sites per square kilomete~.
In
all other areas the density drops to 0.4 sites, for an overall
site density of 0.9 sites per square kilometer.
This inverse relationship may be explained by the seasonal
mobility of Archaic hunters and gatherers, which would have
resulted in greater numbers of encampments for shorter periods
of time, by small groups with specific resource requirements.
The high frequency of small temporary camps seat tered through_ou t
the desert lowlands may reflect a secondary nature of resources
available in this environment.
MESILLA PHASE
Mesilla Phase sites are known throughout the southern
Tularosa Valley (Lehmer 1948; Human System Research 1973, 19-77;
Beckes and Dibble 1976; Beckes, Dibble and Freeman 1977;
Whalen 1977, 1978:.
According to Lehmer (1948), the Mesilla
Phase lasted from A.D. 900 to 1100. Radiocarbon dating techniques developed since Lehmer 1 s formulation of the Jornada
Branch Mogollon cultural chronological scheme seem to indicate

90

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

that distinguishing characteristics associated with Mesilla
Phase occupations were well established in the Jornada area by
at least A.D. 600 and perhaps earlier (see, for example, Aten
1972 and Beckes et al. 1977).
The most distinctive cultural traits associated with the
Mesilla Phase settlements are the introduction of pit house
architecture and a plain brown pottery, EZ Paso Brown.
While
brownware ceramics were observed at numerous localities throughout the study, Mesilla Phase pit house architecture is suggested
at only a single locality (D-100).
During the present study, a total of seventy-two sites are
assigned to the Mesilla Phase solely OQ the basis of brownware
ceramic associations.
This figure represents 36.4 percent of
all identified prehistoric resources in our sample.
Nearly
64 percent of these settlements are classified as Small Camps
(23) and Complex Camps (23).
Other site types include Large
Complex Camps (7); Isolated Hearths (11); Ceramic/Chipped Stone
Scatters (6); and a single Village Complex.
The high frequency of Mesilla Phase Small Camps and Complex
Camps, plus the extremely low incidence of Village Complex
sites, is thought to be related to economic and demographic
factors.
Economic strategies are suggested by the general
character of cultural residues often associated with Mesilla
Phase sites; scattered, thin deposits which generally include
modified flake tools, milling stones, and lithic reduction
debitage.
Demographic factors implied by the general size of
Mesilla sites, which are usually less than 2 ha. in area extent
(X=2.6 ha.), (1) although some increases probably occurred in
group size, population densities seem to have remained low
during this period as compared with the later El Paso Phase;
and (2) although agriculture has been added to the general
subsistence technology, site characteristics appear to reflect
reliance on continued hunting and gathering.
However, there
does appear to be some degree of increased site complexity, as
evidenced by documentation of seven Large Complex Camps and a
Village Complex site,
Both of these site types first appear in
the Mesilla Phase.
Whalen (1977) has suggested a similar
pattern for Mesilla Phase sites identified in the Hueco Balson
area, located just south of Dona Ana Range.
It is interesting
to note that 85 percent of the Mesilla Phase sites identified
by Whalen are contained in the Small Camp and Hamlet settlement
categories.
These site types are generally comparable to the
Small Camp and Complex Camp types which account for 83.8 percent
of the Mesilla Phase sample in this study.
Also, Whalen classified 11.7 percent of the Mesilla Phase sites as Small Villages
and Median Villages (1977:Table 11, p,22).
These site types
are basically similar to the Large Complex Camp and Village
Complex types which comprise 11.1 percent of the Mesilla Phase
occupations in our sample,
Thus, when close comparisons are
made between Mesilla Phase settlement-unit frequencies obtained

SUMMARY

91

by Whalen (1977:21-22) and those generated by this study
(Table 2), there seems to be a high degree of similarity.
Such a correlation is thought to reflect a broad, over-all
continuity in Mesilla Phase settlement patterning in this region
of the southern Tularosa Valley.
There appears to be a slight locational shift in terrain
settings for sites assigned to the Mesilla Phase.
Although sand
dune situations are still in the majority (64.4 percent), there
is an increase in sites found on sand ridges (15.3 percent), and
along distal sections of coalesced fans (15.3 percent).
These
figures suggest a general increase in the utilization of both
sand ridge and distal coalesced fan loc~les during the Mesilla
Phase.
It is suggested that this apparent change in settlement
locations as compared to Nonceramic (Archaic) sites was brought
about by an increased specialization of the exploitive systems.
This trend becomes even more evident in the later El Paso
Phase.
Mesilla Phase sites were identified in all major physiographic zones included in the sample.
The distribution of
Mesilla Phase sites in the sampled area includes 83.8 percent
in the desert lowlands (0.8 sites per km 2 , at .95 CI+ 1.89),
12.5 percent in the coalesced fans of the Organ Mountains (1.3
sites per km 2 , at .95 CI+ .346), and 4.2 percent are located in
all other areas combined-(0.2 sites per km 2 , at .95 CI+ .496).
Although Mesilla Phase sites occur mainly in the desert lowlands, it is argued that utilization of the coalesced fans of
the Organ Mountains region, which contains.both arable land
and water sources, reflects an increased reliance on agriculture.
It is within this physiographic zone that the only Mesilla
Phase Village Complex site is located.
Whalen has indicated that Mesilla Phase settlements
identified in the Hueco Bolson area show a tendency to be
located in the Middle Desert, although most other physiographic
zones were also utilized (Whalen 1977:139).
Whalen's Middle
Desert zone includes both coalesced alluvial fans and adjacent
portions of the desert lowlands.
It is therefore difficult to
compare the data obtained in this study with the distributional
frequencies observed by Whalen.
Nevertheless, the Mesilla Phase
settlement patterns presented by Whalen (1977:25}, and those included in this study (see Figure 6), appear highly similar.
Material observed at Mesilla Phase sites in the sampled
areas generally consists of varying quantities of ceramics,
chipped and ground stone tools, and lithic reduction debitage.
The only ceramics found at these sites were El Paso Brownwares.
It should be emphasized that no intrusive ceramic types were
observed at Mesilla Phase sites during this study.
However,
trade wares have been found in association with Mesilla Phase
sites in surrounding regions (see Type Descriptions and Analysis,
Appendix II),
Intrusive ceramics which have been recovered
from Mesilla Phase sites include Mimbres Boldface and Classic
Black on White, Mimbres Corrugated, San Francisco Red and Alma

92

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

Plain (see Lehmer 1948). Most of the trade wares originate from
the Mimbres region, west of the study area in southwestern New
Mexico.
The absence of intrusive ceramics on Mesilla Phase
sites documented in this study suggests that extra-regional
trade, at least in ceramics, was minimal.
Again, Whalen has
indicated a similar pattern in the Hueco Bolson area (1972:143).
Numerous chipped stone tools, including projectile points,
bifaces and scrapers, were observed at Mesilla Phase sites.
(see
Site Descriptions, Appendix III, this volume).
Although no
precise count was kept, there appeared to be a high proportion
of large flake tools in the assemblages.
This was especially
true at Small and Complex Camp sites located in desert lowland
areas.
The general "quality" of lithic tool manufacturing
observed at Mesilla Phase sites seems to be somewhat less than
that expressed by stone tool assemblages associated with Nonceramic sites.
This apparent trend toward less carefully
executed lithic items becomes more pronounced in the El Paso
Phase.
Lithic raw materials utilized during the Mesilla Phase for
manufacturing chipped stone tools occasionally included the
diversity of materials found at Nonceramic sites.
However, only
the Large Complex Camps and Complex Camps exhibited such
diversity in the material types.
The lithic raw materials
typically found at Mesilla Phase encampments were siliceous
limestone, rhyolite, and several varieties of chert.
Ground stone tools such as manos, basin metates, and other
milling emplements are often found at Mesilla Phase sites.
Occasionally, these tools were intentionally shaped into oval
and subrectangular forms.
These tools consist mainly of limestone and rhyolite, but other raw materials are also represented.
Cultural features identified with Mesilla Phase sites
include small and large rock hearths.
In summary, Mesilla Phase sites identified in the sampled
areas are predominately Small Camps and Complex Camps.
However,
two new site types, the Large Complex Camp and the Village
Complex, appear during the Mesilla Phase.
A general increase
in site complexity, as compared to Nonceramic sites, is indicated.
The Mesilla Phase sites occur in all defined physiographic
areas but are most prominent in the Tularosa Valley floor zone,
suggesting a continued heavy reliance on the resources available in the desert lowlands. Most sites are small, generally
encompassing less than two hectares.
These sites are generally
characterized by thin, sucattered cultural deposits suggestive
of a generalized subsistence pattern of continued reliance on
hunting and gathering partially supplemented by agriculture.
No
obvious evidence of extra-regional contacts during the Mesilla
Phase was recognized during these investigations,

SUMMARY

93

EL PASO PHASE
In contrast to the earlier Mesilla Phase, the El Paso Phase
sites occur in forms and in patterns suggestive of increases
in nucleated population density, settlement-unit size and
settlement complexity.
A heavier reliance on agriculture is
indicated and extra-regional trade implied.
El Paso Phase
sites are perhaps the best documented of the Formative stage
settlements in the southern Tularosa Valley (see Lehmer 1948;
Brook 1966, 1967; Human Systems Research 1973, 1977; Beckes
et aZ. 1977; Whalen 1977, 1978). According to Lehmer's
original dating estimate (1948), the El-Paso Phase encompasses
200 years of prehistory between A.D. 1200 and 1400, and represents a crystallization and intensification of Mogollon culture
already present in the Jornada area.
The present study identified forty-one El Paso Phase sites
which account for 20.7 percent of the total sites recorded.
These sites are classified here into six site types:
Village
Complex (9), Large Complex Camp (4), Complex Camp (8}, Small
Camp (11), Isolated Hearth (7), and Ceramic/Chipped Stone
Scatter (2).
The most significant aspect of these sites concerns the frequency of Village Complex settlements, which account
for 21 percent of the El Paso Phase occupations and 90 percent
of all the Village Complexes represented in our sample.
Concomitant with the expansion of the Village Complex site type
is a substantial increase in settlement-unit size.
While El
Paso Phase sites represent 20.7 percent of all identified
cultural properties, they account for 56.7 percent (333.7 ha,}
of the total occupational area measured in the sampled areqs.
Whalen (_1977) has documented a similar pattern for El Paso
Phase sites identified in the Hueco Balson area,
There is some
discrepancy between Whalen's results and those of th~s study,
For example, Whalen's "Small Camp" site type comprises
66,4
percent of the El Paso Phase sample,
Small Camps identified
during this study (and this site type is comparable in definition
to Whalen's category) account for only 26.8 percent of the El
Paso Phase encampments.
Even when Small Camps, Isolated Hearths,
and Ceramic/Chipped Stone Scatters are combined for compariscrn
they still represent less than 50 percent of the total El Paso
Phase sites.
However, when close comparisons of settlement
units are conducted using Whalents data and be sample obtained
in this study, and allowances are made for certain variations
in site typologies, it becomes clear that the results are
similar.
The variations in site type frequencies pointed out
are thought to be minor.
El Paso Phase sites are situated on sand dunes (18),
sand ridges (102, and coalesced fans (13).
This distribution
seems to indicate a greater degree of preference for both
sand ridges and coalesced fans than that suggested by the
Mesilla Phase and Nonceramic (Archaic) site distributions.
The apparent increase in utilization of these terrain settlements

94

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

is thought to be related to the availability of arable soils
and usable water.
Distributionally, El Paso Phase settlements account for
16.8 percent of the prehistoric resources identified in sampled
areas of the desert lowlands (0.4 sites per km 2 , at .95 CI+
1.89).
Conversely, these properties account for 52.6 percent of
all settlements documented in the coalesced fans of the Organ
Mountains region (1.4 sites per km 2 , at .95 CI+ .346).
It
would appear that in the El Paso Phase, settlement emphasis
shifts from the desert lowlands to the distal coalesced fans of
the Organ Mountains.
This increased density of El Paso Phase sites in the coalesced fans of the Organ Mountains (1.4 sites per km 2 as
compared to .0 for Nonceramic and 1.3 for Mesilla Phase), plus
the increase in site size and complexity (7 Village Complex
settlements as compared to l for Mesilla Phase) and community
size (x = 8.1 ha. as compared to 0.8 ha. for Nonceramic and
2.6 ha. for Mesilla Phase) is perhaps indicative of a greater
reliance on agriculture at this time.
The environmental
factors contributing to such a locational strategy, if indeed
the pattern is accurately interpreted, are not known.
Direct
evidence of agriculture was observed at site D-98, where carbonized corn cobs were exposed over the eastern section of the
size.
One large cluster of this refuse was inside the remains
of a house.
This feature had been exposed by vandalism and
by erosion accelerated by the construction of a tank.
The El Paso Phase settlement distribution seems to have
been at least partially related to paleargid soils (see Appendix I).
A tendency to locate settlements on these soils
may be related to sediment fertility and possibly agricultural
innovations such as irrigation systems.
Although the presence
of irrigation canals or check dams is strongly suspected, we
were unable to document any water control features,
Whalen (1977) has suggested that El Paso Phase settlements
in the Hueco Bolson are consistently located in the Middle
Desert zone.
No comparable physiographic zone is defined in
this study,
However, a detailed comparison of distributional
data indicates that the general tendency of El Paso Phase sites
to be concentrated near the termini of alluvial fans and in
adjacent portions of the desert lowlands is demonstrated by
both studies.
Artifact assemblages identified at El Paso Phase sites in
the sampled areas generally represent a continuum of the Mesilla
Phase materials, except for some minor variations.
The artifacts
characteristically associated with El Paso sites include
several types of chipped and ground stone tools and a variety
of ceramics, including many intrusive wares.
The chipped stone
tools are generally crude in workmanship.
They are mainly
large flake tools, various flake scrapers, modified flakes
and blades, and thick, crude bifaces,
Additional forms such as
projectile points, other thinned bifaces, gravers, notched

SUMMARY

95

flakes, and perforators are rarely found at sites in the desert
lowlands and only occasionally present in assemblages observed
at sites encountered in the distal Coalesced Fans.
Perhaps
the most common chipped stone tools identified at El Paso
Phase sites are the large modified flake tools thought to be
used in plant processing (see section on Chipped Stone).
At El Paso Phase sites, the lithic raw materials which were
used in producing chipped stone tools exhibit much less diversity than those observed at either Mesilla or Nonceramic sites.
The most common lithic materials are siliceous limestone,
rhyolite, and cherts.
Most of this material is locally available in erosional channels cut into baJ"adas fronting the Organ,
Franklin, and Jarilla Mountains.
The ceramics identified at El Paso Phase sites include both
indigenous and trade wares, and are considerably more diverse
than earlier assemblages.
El Paso Bro~n continues as the
predominant local ware, but El Paso Bichromes and Polychromes
are present in substantial quantities, especially at the larger
settlements.
The analysis of ceramic types identified and/or
collected at these sites indicates that intrusive wares are
common at the larger El Paso Phase settlements (see Appendix
III).
These intrusive ceramics are indicative of significant
increases in extra-regional trade systems, which seem to have
extended throughout New Mexico and included sections of
Arizona and Chihuahua, Mexico.
Thus, the El Paso Phase
evidences far more complex trade networks than those suggested
for the Mesilla Phase.
El Paso Phase sites exhibit structural features including
large and small rock hearths, charcoal/ash pits, adobe surface
structures, and previously-unrecognized features herein referred
to as rabbit-roasting pits.
Rabbit-roasting pits, which seem
to be restricted to the larger Village Complex sites, are~dense
concentrations of charred rabbit bones (Lepus aalifornicus)
in what appear to be shallow earth ovens, perhaps one meter deep
and one to two meters in diameter.
The plan is somewhat
subrectangular in outline with converging walls producing a
basin shaped cross-section.
Several rabbit-roasting pits were
revealed in pot-holes.
These exposed features contained
thousands of charred bones, numberous pottery fragments and
various small flake tools, such as flake scrapers and modified
blades, were visible in the profiles of these features.
Such
a concentration suggests a continued reliance on hunting during
this time and may be associated with seasonal rabbit hunts (see
Basehart in Human Systems Research 1975: 155).
Some pueblo structures are partially exposed, while
others were inferred from surficial characteristics.
These
features are restricted in distribution, and are a criteria for
defining Village Complex settlements.
Again, the exposure of
these features resulted from pot-h-0les and tank-generated
erosion.
The general characteristics of these structural

96

THE PREHISTORIC RESOURCE

remnants could not be determined from surface observations.
However, large fragments of packed adobe were found in asaociation with dense, rectangular concentrations of cultural
residues, primarily ceramics.
These concentrations are very
well defined and usually measure five to ten meters across.
To summarize, the distinguishing characteristics of the
El Paso Phase sites are: 1) a significant increase in community
size, with the greatest number of sites slustering on or near
the distal Coalesced Fans: 2) a general increase in site
complexity; 3) increased reliance on agriculture, and possible
innovations in agricultural technology; 4) the occurrence of
specialized features such as rabbit-roasting pits; 5) the
addition of numerous intrusive ceramix types indicating
extensive extra-regional trade systems throughout portions of
New Mexico, Arizona, and Chihuahua, Mexico.

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

ABSTRACT
During the summer of 1976 and spring of 1977, portions of
Dona Ana Artillery Range were surveyed for historic sties and
structures.
Many areas of the range which were known to be
locations of important historic sites, such as Boulder and
Soledad canyons, were not accessible to survey due to intensive
military use over many years.
However, the fifteen historic
sites which were recorded were presumed to be typical expressions of many of the ranching, mining, and military activities
which had occurred on the Range in the last 100 years.
Military activities have all but completely destroyed
historic structures on Do~a Ana Range.
It is possible, however,
that an examination of the visual evidence available in the
newly-discovered Cobb files, together with a study of the
archeological record, may make possible pY'oductive comparisons
of ranching sites on Do~a Ana and McGregoY' ranges, as well as
comparisons of ranching traditions in the southern Tularosa
Basin with those in other areas of the South and Southwest.

INTRODUCTION
In 1933, Harvey Fergusson described the Southwest as an
area in which the character of the land was the destiny of the
people who lived on it.
The Southwest, in his words, was a land
of "long isolations and long journeys.
It was a place of
II
rebellions,
. prolific of legends, dreams, and myths.
Above all, it is a land where water has always
been scarce and therefore precious, a thing to
be fought for, prayed for and cherished in
beautiful vessels--a land where thunder is
sacred and rain is a God (Fergusson 1933: 9-10).
Such a Southwestern landscape, whether located in the
South Plains country of West Texas, the deserts of the Tularosa
Basin, or the long waterless stretches to the east and west of

108

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

Dos Cabezas, contains, intrinsically, the implication that only
certain people could succeed in living there.
Sonnichsen
characterized such individuals as "fierce and rugged" (1960: 3);
Eve Ball, writing of the Pecos Valley, described other types:
those
. decent, honest folk who handed down
not only land, cattle and rugged pioneer
qualities, but traditions of community and
cooperation to their descendents (1969: xi).
Historical events, the practical exp~essions of people
living in a specific place and time, have followed a general
sequence in the southern Tularosa Basin which has been typical
of most of the Southwest.
The area has provided a stage for
events--Indian wars, military intervention and exploration,
settlement, and seeking after water, that sine qua non of life
in arid regions--which have exemplified the Southwestern experience, and reoccurred in West Texas, the Pecos and Mimbres
valleys, and the mountain ranges in between.
Migrants of the
1880's, for example, who settled in the Organ Mountains, were
part of an essentially Southern migration
. from the Atlantic Seaboard to the
hill country of Tennessee, Georgia, and
Alabama to the Plains of Texas and Oklahoma
and thence .
to the West Coast (Vogt 1955: 15).
However, no area can be replicated.
Though their activities followed a general pattern, the Tularosa's historic protagonists were each special, and no study can be valid which does
not both recognize a regional pattern and highlight the unique
situations and individuals who contributed to that pattern.
In the southern Tularosa--in particular the areas now included
within the McGregor Missile and Dona Ana Artillery ranges-uniqueness might best be ascribed to a climate which is unusually dry and rigorous, qualities attested to by the fact that
preliminary surveys of the Sacramentos, Organs, and lava beds
of Carrizozo never extended to the dunes and flats which stretched
between Soledad Canyon and Hueco Tanks.
Results of only superficial glances at the basin floor, ninet~enth-century maps of
the area consisted largely of blank space.
The intensity of the Tularosa climate eventually resulted
in other claims to uniqueness.
Cut off from the Pecos and Rio
Grande by the Sacramento and Organ mountains, parts of the
Tularosa Basin were explored and developed as much as a decade
after the rest of the Southwest.
The eastern portion of the
valley, especially, was the stage for events in the 1880's
which had occurred earlier elsewhere, when the final push of
Texan and Southern migrants who had filled the Pecos River area

and moved into the Sacramento Mountains spilled over into the
basin to take up some of the last extensive free range left in
the Southwest.
All of the southern Tularosa Basin, including the portion
now designated as Dona Ana Artillery Range, was a part in some
manner of a broader Southwestern heritage of climate and historic
human activity.
However, just as an unusual degree of geographical isolation tinged the Tularosa with a slightly different
cast from the area to the east and west, so events on Dona Ana
were
somewhat different from those which transpired elsewhere
in the basin.
Their unique quality may be attributed directly to
the presence of the Organ Mountains.
Variously described as
"attractive" and "repellant," the Organs'provided throughout
historic times both a sure and steady source of water and a
refuge for the Range's 1 first historic occµpants-~the Mescilero
Apaches.
By a quirk of fate that must have seemed diabolical
to the area's nineteenth-century Anglo invaders, the mountains
which supplied the life-blood of the plains also hid the
"scourge" which prevented permanent settlement there.
Despite the Mescalero threat, Spanish, and later Anglo,
activity on Dona Ana began relatively early due largely to
springs in the Organs such as Soledad and San Augustine, 2
and proximity to El Paso and Mesilla.
To protect the Rio Grande
settlements, Spanish expeditions, such as those led by Otermin
in 1682 and O'Conor in 1775, ventured into the Organs from the
nearby settlement of Dona Ana, or followed a well-defined road
north from the El Paso district to confront the Mescalero in
Soledad Canyon.
Other groups came from as far away as Chihuahua
City to take the Salt Road to the Tularosa Lakes where they
collected the valuable commodity on a journey that took almost
four days to go from El Paso and return.
Forays against marauding Apaches continued throughout the
nineteenth century.
In retaliation for their frequent raids on
the Rio Grande Valley, Mexicans, and later Anglos, chased the
Mescaleros across San Augustine Pass and then pursued them to
their favorite strongholds either at Dog Canyon in the Sacramentos or Soledad Canyon in the Organs.
Lieutenant-Colonel
Dixon S. Miles reported Apache encampments east of Fort Fillmore
in November 1855.
Three years later, Lieutenant W. H. Jackson,

l

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

with twenty mounted rifles from Fort Bliss, started a pursuit
that traced a trail to Soledad and San Augustine springs.
Partly because of the fear instilled by 200 years of active
warfare, reports of hostile Indians occurred well past the
initiation of the reservation period.
But not even alarms
sounded by Warren Shedd and Benjamin Davies at the San Augustine
Ranch, or by Frank Fletcher in Soledad Canyon, could halt the
flood of miners to the area after the opening of Stephenson's
Mine on the western slope in 1849, or the flow of ranchers to
the eastern slope after the Civil War.
Spurred on by promises of
mineral and livestock wealth, these two enterprising groups
braved reports of Mescalero raids throughout the Organs and on
the plains to the east to prospect, mine,' and ranch.
The myth of mineral wealth and buried treasure had long been
a part of the lure of the Southwest.
Although expeditions by
Klvar Nu~ez Cabeza de Vaca in 1536, and Fray Marcos de Niza to
c{bola in 1539, failed to find any treasure, legends of the
fabulous wealth which they had pursued lasted for centuries
(Campa 1963: 3, 5).
The specific myth of the Seven Cities
died, but innumerable fantasies of buried treasure and lost mines
had been born.
In the Organ Mountains, fact and fantasy were interwoven.
The story of Padre La Rue instigated hundreds of claims from the
Franklin Mountains to the northernmost peaks of the Organs, and
there were just enough substantial discoveries of paying minerals
to keep the legends alive.
The Stephenson-Bennett Mine, opened
in 1849, was productive and profitable for over seventy years,
while other claims in Soledad and Texas canyons, and in the
northern portions of the Franklins, provided prospectors a
reason to continue their work.
The ranchers who developed the plains to the east of
th~ Organs participated
in a similar gamble as they quickly
claimed the basin's other form of wealth--water--and brought in
thousands of head of sheep and cattle.
Warren Shedd developed
the multiple springs of San Augustine after the Civil War, and
was joined in the early 1870's by two fellow ranchmen, Benjamin
Davies and H~nry Lesinsky.
Their herds ran north to San Nicolas
Spring and south to Soledad where two other sheepmen, the Moody
brothers, lived.
By the early 1890's, Do~a Ana, like must of the Southwest,
was largely cattle country.
W. W. Cox, backed by Mayer Halff,
himself owner of land south of Soledad, bought the San Augustine
Ranch and firmed up claims running south to Coe Lake.
In Soledad
Canyon, two families from Texas--the Isaacks and Beasleys-bought out the Moody brothers and brought in cattle and goats.
Albert and Mary Coe from the Sacramento Mountains filed claims
on land around Coe and Cheese (later Stewart) lakes, while
W. H. McNew, friend and associate of Oliver Lee, developed a
headquarters a few miles north of Orogrande and ran his cattle
south almost to Newman.

INTRODUCTION

111

At the same time large claims were being carved out,
small homesteads were established.
Some, like those of Maximo
Casta~eda at the mouth of Soledad, or Andrew Kinsella and James
Ellwood north of Coe Lake, soon disappeared without a trace.
Another homesteader, J. F. Findlay, stayed a little longer,
perhaps because his claim was located in the western portion of
the Organ Mountains where water was at least seasonally available.
In the end, however, the military returned to supplant them
all.
Beginning in 1911, when the government condemned a core of
two townships running north-south from the present-day Dona Ana
Range Camp, the acquisition of the Range was steady and
irrevocable.
Protest to the proceedings,.which was as vociferous
on Dona Ana as it had been on McGregor, was hopeless, and despite
the rancher~ attempts to hold onto their land and livelihood, the
government accomplished the acquisition of all the Dona Ana
Range by 1958.
If there are few historic remains on McGregor Range, there
are virtually none in the portion of Dona Ana which was open to
survey. 3
The army initiated a program to sell off surplus range
property, and eventually buildings not sold for salvage were
decimated by tank and troop activity.
By 1977, historic remains
included a melting adobe ruin at Coe Lake; a few watering tanks
at Goodin Well, McNew's South Tank, Globe Pasture, and Wesley
[sic] Well; and outlines of footings where buildings had once
stood.
A careful study of historic sites of Dona Ana confirms many
of the conclusions derived from a similar examination of sites
on the McGregor Range, and draws the basin together into a
unified cultural entity.
Water, its availability or lack, has
been the major determining factor throughout the Tularosa, and
the sites on Dona Ana are an expression of this concern with
water resources.
The archeological remains of Do~a Ana Range are also
expressive of the ranching tradition which spawned them.
Laid
out largely by families with common Southern, and later Texan,
backgrounds, the material remains of the Coe, McNew, and Cox
ranches may be rich grounds for the formulation of theories
about southwestern ranching traditions.

3

The survey crew was not allowed access to the Organs--the area
of greatest potential for historic sites--and so reports of
structures in Soledad and Boulder canyons could not be
officially confirmed.

112

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

THE EARLY SETTING: APACHES, SALT, and GRASS
The earliest historic occupants of Do'O.a Ana Range were the
Mescalero Apache, whose evolution as a tribe and subsequent use
of the Tularosa Basin and surrounding ranges has been summarized
by Albert Schroeder in the following manner:
The unnamed nomads east of the Piro Pueblos in
the 1580's and the Apaches of Perrillo in the
same region in the 1600's became known as the
Sierra Blancas in the last half [sic] of the
1600's.
After the Pueblo Rebellion of 1680 this
group, which had moved north, bec~me known as
the Faraones, and by the 1760's they began
returning to the Sierra Blanca Mountain region
under Spanish pressure.
The nomads of the Pecos
River, encountered by Castano de Sosa in the
1590's and the Apaches of the Siete Rios in the
1600's continued to frequent their same haunts
after the Pueblo Rebellion, becoming known as
Natages in 1726.
By the mid-1700's those near
the Pecos also were known as the Salineros and
those in the Organ Mountains near El Paso as the
Mescaleros, which term supplanted Natage in the
1790's and Faraon in the early 1800's (Schroeder
1974, I: 534).1+
In the western portion of the Tularosa Basin, evidences of
Mescalero activity consisted primarily of trails and campsites.
A favorite target for raids throughout the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries was the town and fortification of Do~a Ana, just north of present-day Las Cruces; and one
significant pattern of Apache activity for over 200 years
consisted of a surprise attack on Dona Ana, or later Mesilla to
the south, and then a quick retreat east over San Augustine Pass
to San Augustine Springs.
At the Springs, the raiders generally
continued north to Oja San Nicolas, and thence east to the
Sacramento Mountains; or they retreated directly to Soledad
Canyon where they either dispersed or regrouped to defend
themselves against the retaliating Spanish forces (Fig. 20).
This pattern of Organ Mountain use was noted by Spanish
chroniclers as early as 1682, when Governor Otermin halted at
Dona Ana and learned about the Apache raids which had reached
their height during the Pueblo Rebellion.
Occupants of the
little settlement informed him that one area of Apache habitation
was in the Organs east of Dona Ana.
In an attempt to punish the

Mescaleros for their "many atrocities," he marched to the Organs
in a short-lived and unsuccessful campaign (Thomas 1974: 14).
From his description of a large cave in a huge rock, it is
apparent that Otermin's foray may have taken him to the Cuevas
on the western slope of the Organs near present-day Fillmore
Canyon (Fig. 20).
He found only cold hearths.
Apache attacks on the Rio Grande Valley, followed by
retreats to the Organs, continued throughout the eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries.
Rub{ noted that the Mescalero
"inhabited the mountains, Organ, Sierra Obscura, Sacramento,
Sierra Blanca, and Seven Rivers" (Thomas 1974: 18), and in
August 1766 he set out with N{colas de Lafera to travel up the
Rio Grande.
He noted the Los Mansos (Los' Organos) Sierra on the
right, three or four leagues distant, and from his camp at Los
Bracitos, pointed out the passes: Los Organos and Soledad.
Of
particular interest, he said, was:
. the Soledad spring situated in the
center of that valley at a distance of eight
or nine leagues.
Some Apache ranchert'as
are permanently located there, as well as at
San August1n spring ten or twelve leagues to
the north-northeast on the other side of
some peaks (Kinnaird 1958: 85).
For the next forty years, the Spanish mounted a concerted
attack against the Mescalero.
As a result, Rubio reported to
Croix that the Apaches were being pushed southward from Sierra
Blanca to the Organ Mountains and the Rio Grande (Thomas 1932:
63).
In 1775, O'Conor planned an offensive against the
Mescalero which examined the Organ Mountains and resulted in
heavy losses for the Apache (Thomas 1974: 21).
Thirty-five
years later, in retaliation for Mescalero raids, an expedition
penetrated the Organs, as well as the Sacramentos and Sierra
Blanca (Thomas 19 7 4: 2 7) •
Such a heavy concentration of raids would normally have
discouraged any attempts at settlement on the eastern and
western flanks of the Organs.
But two natural resources existed
in abundance, and their value was too much to ignore, even in
the light of a clear Mescalero threat.
The first resource was grass, and although The Borderer, a
Las Cruces newspaper, warned as late as June 15, 1871, that the
plain on the western side of the Organs was constantly under
Apache threat, some Spaniards endeavored to use the ''fine growth
of gramma grass" as early as 1805.
At that time, a retired
Lieutenant of Dragoons of the Provincial Militia of El Paso del
Norte named Juan Antonio Garcfa de Noriega petitioned for a grant
from El Bracito south to Lake Trujillo. 5
He agreed to build a

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

house and corrals, to farm, and to keep fifteen armed men for the
protection of travelers up the Rio Grande and miners who had
discovered valuable silver deposits in the Organs shortly after
1800.
Unfortunately, the Spanish government never officially
recognized the grant, and when the Mescalero increased their
raids around 1820, the ranch community dissolved.
The lands of the Bracito Grant remained empty until 18231824 when an empresario from New York State, John G. Heath,
attempted to colonize the area with Missouri settlers.
Heath's
grant included the Bracito Grant and ran just inside the present
boundary of Dona Ana Range from the Cueva to Paso de los
Alamitos.
It was even shorter-lived thap that of Garc{a de
Noriega, however, for it was repudiated within a year, and the
lands given back to Garc{a de Noriega by Lieutenant Governor Jose
Ordas.
Garc1a de Noriega and his family immediately moved back
to the Bracito and built an adobe house.
He farmed, and ran
large herds of sheep on the mesa, perhaps as far east as Puerto
de los Alamitos.
About the same time, Mexicans from El Paso and Chihuahua
City began to exploit the salt fields around Lake Lucero.
Braving potential Apache attacks from the Sacramentos to the east
and Organs to the west, caravans slowly moved up the Tularosa
on the beginning of their four-day round trip.
They passed
Puerto de los Alamitos (located around present-day Stewart Lake)
and camped at Ojo de Soledad before moving on to San Augustine
Springs, Ojo San Nicolas, and ending their trek at the salt lakes
near the foot of the San Andres (Fig. 20).
Although some historians have dated the use of the San
Andres salt lakes to time immemorial, witnesses testified, after
the outbreak of hostilities over the Guadalupe salt deposits,
that Mexicans from El Paso had discovered the salt lakes of the
San Andres about 1824.
In particular, Ramon Ortiz stated that in
that year the Mexican government had conceded to settlements on
the Rio Grande the use and produce of the lakes, but that after
the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Texas took possession of ''all
the lands lying north of the Rio Grande and belonging to El Paso,
Real, and Seneca." By 1850, the salt lakes were claimed by at
least three different individuals, each with title from Texas
(U.S. Rouse of Representatives 1868: 68).
Ultimately, debate over the use of the deposits--between
Hispanos who felt they were community property and Anglos who
insisted they were private--culminated in the Magoffin Salt War
of 1854. 6
The Guadalupe salt lakes opened up east of El Paso

6

In 1936, Watson Ritch, a rancher on the western edge of White
Sands, found a carreta eroding out of the dunes.
Bowden has
suggested that the cart may have been one involved in an
ambush of Mexican salteros by Magoffin's associates.
It is
now on display at the Monument.

and took some of the pressure off the Tularosa lakes.
But
residents of the upper El Paso and Mesilla valleys who wanted to
brave Magoffin and his cohorts, not to mention the Mescalero
Apache, could still use the road over San Augustine Pass and
intersect the Salt Road just south of Ojo San Nicolas. 7
Saltero use of the road along the eastern foot of the
Organs decreased dramatically after the late 1850's.
However,
continuous attacks by Mescalero on El Paso and the Rio Grande
Valley resulted in increased military traffic as the pattern
established during the Spanish and Mexican periods continued
during and after the Mexican and Civil wars.
John T. Hughes
commented in 1846 that Mescalero had only recently driven off
twenty yoke of oxen belonging to the commissary trains near Dona
Ana.
Other groups of Apaches
. were continually making incursions
from the mountains upon the settlements of
El Paso, plundering and robbing whomsoever
chanced to fall in their way, whether
Mexican or American, and driving off large
herds of mules and flocks of sheep (Hughes
1962: 285).
Averam B. Bender has described the pattern of Mescalero
activity up to the opening of the Civil War as being one of
. periodic raids by small bands,
punitive expeditions, petitions of
citizens for greater protection,
distribution of presents by Indian officials,
and preparation for reservation life (1974:
159).
In an attempt to encourage the Apaches to turn to reservation
life, a treaty defining the boundaries of their hunting grounds
was made at Fort Thorn in 1855.
This agreement was also intended
to reduce the Apache threat to nearby settlements, but it had
little chance of success because of the activities of isolated
hostile Indian groups.
Miles reported Balanquita (Barranquito)
and his band of five or six families encamped in the Organ

7

James A. Bennett noted that, in 1855, the salt lakes were
about forty miles long and three to five miles wide.
"Salt
is in such abundance that it lies from 3 to 8 feet deep as far
from the shore as 3 miles.
Wagons are driven to the shore and
loaded with shovels.
No other process is necessary to
procure salt" (Brooks and Reeve 1948: 65).

San Andres.

Mountains east of Fort Fillmore in November of 1855 (Bender 1974:
130), while, less than a year later, Captain J. Van Horn was
informed that Shawano's band was in the Organs east of Doffa Ana
(Thomas 1974: 41).
Such Apache activity was frequently accompanied by
incidents of raiding and stock theft.
In July 1858, Mescaleros
stole mules and horses from Colonel James B. Leach's Pacific
Wagon Road party about five miles north of Fort Bliss.
Lieutenant W. H. Jackson and twenty mounted rifles started in pursuit
and followed the Apache to Soledad and San Augustine ~prings
before tracing them north to San Nicolas Spring, and then to Dog
Canyon in the Sacramentos.
Again, three years later, the newspaper reported sightings of Apaches in the Organs east of Las
Cruces with large numbers of stock "probably stolen from the
surrounding ranches" (The San Francisco Herald January 28, 1861:
3), as well as an attack on Mr. A. Barnes' pack train on January
31.
Consisting of seven wagons, the train was attacked by
Indians near San Augustine Springs.
One driver was killed and
one wounded (Semi-Weekly Southern News February 22, 1861: 2).
Depredations continued throughout the Civil War and into
the 1870's.
A march was made in May and June of 1869 by Captain
Ed. G. Meyer, who followed the saltero"-ltiiilitary>trail north to
?uerto de los Alamitos, Ojo Soledad, and Ojo de San Augustine,
where he heard reports, probably from Warren Shedd, of Apache
depredations in the vicinity (Meyer 1869: n.p.).
Governor William A. Pile's report, that he found comparative
quiet and security in June 1871 in the Organs and at San
Augustine Pass (Bender 1974: 258), must have elicited outraged
reactions from inhabitants of the Mesilla Valley.
The Borderer
remarked that Apaches were still so numerous in the Organs that
ranchers could not graze livestock on the plains without having
them driven off (June 15, 1871: 1).
On May 28, 1872, Warren
Shedd reported that W. B. Blanchard's wagon train had been
attacked about eight miles south of the San Augustine Ranch.
Subsequently, word was sent to Fort Selden that, as nearly as
could be judged, there were about 400 Indians around Blanchard's
train and in the mouth of Soledad Pass (The Borderer June 5, 1872:
1, 2).
A scant two weeks later, Indians attacked three men as
they crossed San Augustine Pass on their way to Shedd's Ranch
(The Borderer June 12, 1872: 2).
Although most of the Mescalero had settled on their
reservation by the mid-1870's, raids continued until 1880.
Much
activity seemed to center on San Augustine Pass, where it was
easy to pick off solitary travelers or small groups on their way
from the Rio Grande Valley to Tularosa and Fort Stanton via
Shedd's Ranch.
Soledad Canyon also remained a favorite retreat,
perhaps because of its plentiful water and innumerable side
canyons.
Indians who stole a horse from Canutillo on January 16,
1879, were followed to Soledad Pass and overtaken, but managed to
overwhelm their pursuers (Thirty-four January 22, 1879: 3).

Benjamin Davies, resident and subsequent owner of Shedd's Ranch,
passed along a report to the newspaper from Lieutenant
McGonnigle of Fort Bliss who had crossed a fresh Indian track
approximately eight miles south of San Augustine in February 1880.
The trail, which was about four feet wide and ran from east to
west, appeared to be heading for Soledad Canyon.
Davies was sure
that Apaches had either crossed the Organs by way of Soledad, or
were "still near us hiding in the mountains" (Thirty-four
February 25, 1880: 1).
THE WHEELER SURVEY: PREDICTIONS
Despite the high incidence of Indian attack, there was an
aspect of nineteenth-century military activity on Dona Ana Range
other than the punitive one.
Shortly after the Mexican W~r,
Congress had issued directives for the survey and development of
emigrant roads.
In addition, settlers were pressuring the New
Mexico Surveyor General to subdivide the territory's public
lands, and the United States government to survey and classify
the land according to its base use.
For these reasons, a
significant proportion of the army's activities on Dona Ana
during the nineteenth century were of an exploratory, scientific
nature, as members of the Army Corps of Engineers traversed the
valley floor and scaled the Organ peaks, seeking to assess the
area's potential for mining, ranching, and agriculture. 8
The individual who was most thoroughly involved in such
surveying and land classification was Captain George M. Wheeler.
Ordered to complete a geographical survey of all lands in the
United States west of the lOOth meridian, Wheeler had progressed
to the northern Tularosa Basin around Three Rivers by 1~79.
The
expedition, run by an assistant, Lieutenant Eugene Griffin, was
to result in an extensive report on the Organ Range from Soledad
Canyon north.
It originated on August 5, 1878, when Party No. 2,
Colorado Section, left Fort Union under the direction of Griffin
and h~aded south for Fort Stanton.
The group stayed briefly at
Stanton, and then headed for the malpais and San Andres Range.
Th~y struck a road which ran along the eastern edge of the Range
south to San Augustine Pass, and carefully mapped the mountains
and plains on either side.
By September 9, the party was
transferred to San Augustine where they stayed at Shedd's.

THE WHEELER SURVEY:

PREDICTIONS

123

Later the same month, a second party left San Augustine,
and after mapping the Jornada worked its way south along the
Rio Grande to Fort Bliss.
At that point, three members of the
expedition - W. G. Walbridge, assistant topographer; W. A.
Phillips, Jr., odometer recorder; and one packer - left El Paso
for San Augustine and travelled just east of the Organs on the
old saltero road.
They climbed North Franklin Peak, the last
point in their system of triangulations, then completed their
three-day trip to Shedd's, which they reached on the 17th.
For
six days, the fully-assembled party mapped the topography of the
Organs, making trips out from the ranch headquarters (U.S. Army.
Engineer Department 1879: 223-226).
In his assessment made to George Wheeler on March 26, 1879,
Griffin remarked on the two potentially most important industries
of the lower Tularosa Valley and Organ Mountains.
The mining
industry was represented by Stephenson's Mine, which had been
worked for a number of years.
But the owners, he mentioned,
were experiencing problems with transportation and lawsuits.
Even so, the property had been profitable, and it was Griffin's
opinion that mining in the Organs was a subject which had never
received the attention it deserved.
As far as stock-raising was concerned, it was apparent to
Griffin that wnol was the most profitable porduct, and he
estimated that some 10,000 sheep grazed on the range in 1878-1879.
Cattle raising was similarly profitable, for the grass, if not
luxurious, seemed to posses.s great nutritional value.
The
report concluded w~th an analysis of the land surveyed and a
classification of it according to best use.
Of 4,656 square
miles, 2,984 provided good grazing and 642 poot, 439 were covered with large timber and 169 with small, 280 square miles were
arid or barren, and 132 were arable with irrigation (U.S. Army.
Engineer Department 1870: 228).
The importance of the Wheeler Survey to the history of the
western Tularosa Basin lay in Wheeler's official recognition and
the two industires most appropriate to the area.
Mining and
ranching had occurred sporadically for approximately thirty
years priour to Wheeler's comprehensive survey.
But as if in
affirmation of his accuracy in assessing the geography of the
Tularosa, the area experienced an unprecendented boom in both
mineral exploration and livestock production in the twenty years
that followed publication of his 1879 report.

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

MINING IN THE ORGANS: ELUSIVE MYTHS AND HARD REALITIES

J. Frank Dobie has said, about one of the Southwest's great
lost mines, that the chief actor in the drama of the search for
it has been the mine itself.
The landscape in which the mine is
located
. is a world of little rain wherein
races of men no longer extant left hieroglyphic records of thriving population,
arts, fierce struggle and then vanishment.
It is a world of illimitable vistas, of
geological inscrutables, and of things
both animate and inanimate deeply hidden.
Man-made highways and automobiles crisscross
this world but hardly penetrate it, enter
it but scarcely get into it deeper than the
furrow of an ocean liner gets into the waters
of the everlasting deeps (Dobie 1939: 4).
Pitted against this protagonist and landscape are various people,
all with "many names, diverse features, varying characteristics"
but guided by a single motive and passion, "gold,
, .. _gold
found and lost" (Dobie 1939: 4).
- Every mountain range in the Southwest has its tr~df tion 6f
buried treasure, and the Organs are no exception.
Here, the
protagonist has been the Padre La Rue Mine, and much mining
activity has been instigated by people who either hoped to find
the treasure themselves, or knew how to make a living off those
who were willing to finance th~ search.
The La Rue legend revolved around a Catholic priest from
southern France who was sent to Mexico and eventually assigned
to a small settlement in Durango.
He learned of a rich lode from
a soldier who had been stationed near the Rio Grande, and soon
gathered a group of followers who were interested in developing
the treasure.
The mine was supposedly located a few days' travel
~eyond El Pasn del Norte in the mountain range called ~Lo~
Organos."
The band, led by La Rue, followed the soldier's directions
and located a mine
.
Soledad
Springs
looking

near Saint Augustine Pass in
Canyon between Espiritu Santo
and La Cuev~ de las Vegas overthe Mesilla Valley (Campa 1963: 18).

The community went to work, building an arrastra~ forge, and
bellows.
Meanwhile, authorities in Durango had become suspicious when
they found La Rue's colony in northern Mexico abandoned, and
dispatched an investigator named Maximiliano.
He followed La Rue's
trail to Mesilla and discovered the colony's mining activities.
His demands that La Rue turn the mining proceeds over to the
Catholic Church were ignored, and when he returned with

MINING IN THE ORGANS

125

soldiers, La Rue and his followers hid the gold.
Naturally, it
was never found again (Campa 1963: 17-21). 9
True believers have panted down La Rue's trail for years, but
the actualities of mineral discovery and exploitation in the
southern Organs were considerably less spectacular than the
legend would lead one to believe.
Silver discoveries occurred
as early as the beginning of the nineteenth century (Bowden 1971:
85), but mining of note did not begin until 1849 when a Mexican,
in partnership with Hugh Stephenson, discovered a vein north of
Fillmore Canyon (Fig. 21).
Eventually, Stevenson assumed sole
ownership, and although Pope reported in 1855 that development
was slow, it was profitable enough to justify further work (U.S.
Army Corps of Topographic Engineers [1855]: 42).
By 1857,
production had totalled approximately $90,000 (Dunham 1935: 188).
According to an account in the Rio G:r>ande RepubZican (January 14,
1888: 3), the ore was taken out with dynamite, packed on donkeys,
and taken sixteen miles to a smelter near Fort Fillmore.
In 1858, a consortium of army officers at Fillmore bought
the mine for $12,500 cash.
A large sum was invested in improvements, and a German mining engineer--Professor Rittler from
Freiburg--was put in charge.
During the Civil War, things went badly at the mine.
A
smelter which arrived in 1861 was captured by the Confederates,
and a sale to an English company in 1867 ran into trouble when the
title was contested.
Only in 1872, when the property was
repatented as the San Augustine Mine by Warren Shedd, Henry
Lesinsky, and others, did steady operations resume (Rio G:r>ande
RepubZican January 14, 1888: 3).
Perhaps inspired by the success of the Stephenson Mine, a
party of four men filed a mining claim nearby called the Santa
Susana on October 8, 1853.
Sole possessors were Mariano Aguire,
Pedro Aguire, Samuel G. Bean, and E. Henere [?].
The mine lay
about twelve miles east of Las Cruces, and consisted of gold,
silver, and lead deposits (Dona Ana County, Records Vol. B: 4748}.
Two members of the party, Pedro and Mariano Aguire, also
filed on the Refugio Mine, a property located near the Santa
Susana, and partners this time were Thomas Bull and Joseph H.
Tucker (Do~a Ana County, Records Vol. B: 29).
A third mine, the
Las Cruces, was claimed by Bull, Mariano Barela, and Alexander
Daguerre on April 25, 1854 (Dofia Ana County, Records Vol. B: 112). 10

For a number of versions of the Padre La Rue legend, see Campa
1963.
A geologist with the Parke Survey, Thomas Antisell, noted in an
1856 report (U.S. Congress.
House of Representatives.
1857:
161} that a Spaniard named Barilla worked a vein of galena and
erected an adobe smelter nearlby "some years back." Antisell
located the vein in "Soldado canon" which Dunham says was an
alternate name for Fillmore.
Antisell could not visit the old
mine, "owing to several lodges of Apaches being encamped there
at the time of my visit."

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

A description of the consolidation of these mines places the
eastern portion of them well within the western boundary of
Dona Ana Range.
Reopened under the name Organ Mountain Mines by
Samuel Bean, Caleb Sherman, W. Claude Jones, Eugene Leonart,
James A. Lucas, Henry J. Cuniffe, Henry Grandjean, George W.
Southwick, and Justus McCarty, the mines were supposed to
produce silver, copper, and lead.
The boundary of the claim began
500 yards south of the Cueva, ran south 1,000 Varas, then east
to the highest summit of Organ Mountain, along the summit of the
mountain north 2,000 Varas, then west to a point in the plains at
the base of the mountain, then south to the place of beginning
(Fig. 21).
The nine partners formed the Organ Mountain Mining
Company and capitalized at $500,000.
Their agreement was signed
on March 15, 1858 (Dona Ana County, Records Vol. B: 322-323).
The Santa Susana, now part of the Organ Mountain Mines,
was mentioned from time to time in the newspapers (The Mesilla
Times May 11, 1861: n.p.; The BoPderer May 15, 1872: n.p.),
hut eventually it appears to have been swallowed up in the
official bounds of the Organ Mountains Mining District, an area
that ran north fifteen miles from San Augustine Pass, and south
from the pass to Soledad Canyon, extending ten miles in each
direction east and west from the foot of the Organs (Do~a Ana
County, Book of Mining Claims No. 2: 463).
Following the Wheeler Survey of 1878, and the settlement of
the Mescalero, the prospecting in the southern Organs accelerated.
Perhaps spurred on by a newspaper account about two Mexicans who
mysteriously slipped into the heart of the Organs south of San
Augustine and probably returned with "wealth enough to support
them" man thly (Rio Grande Re pub liaan Fe b.rua.ry 3, 1883 ~ l,),
William Whitzel "turn[ed] the east end of Soledad Canon upside
down" (Rio Grande Republican March 10, 1883: 1).
L. W.
Lenoir located a claim in October 1883 on the Soleda Mine about
five miles south of Davies' and Lesinsky's Ranch at the mouth of
Soledad Canyon, and one-and-a-half miles west of the road from El
Paso to Tularosa.
Later, Lenoir located a mill site nearby,
which he used to reduce ores from the mine.
The location of the
mill was the approximate center of the southwest corner of section
31 in T23S, R5E (Fig. 2)(DoWa Ana County, Location No. 5: 190, 191).
Other claims in and around Soledad Canyon included a Soledad Mine
two miles east of the Moody Ranch (near the future location of the
Isaacks house), located March 17, 1886, by C. H. Ake; another
Soledad Mine on April 1, 1888, by T. J. Moody, Jr.; and
innumerable mines up and down the Canyon by E. C. Rucker and
members of the Beasley family (Fig. 2l)(Dofia Ana County, Location
No. 5: 613, 802; Mining Claims No. 6: 165, 293-294; Mining Claims
No. 9: 223, 234, 336, 337).
Even though mining was such hard work, prospectors
frequently persisted in looking for profitable claims and easy
wealth in the form of buried treasure long after their credulity
should have been strained by lack of results.
George Schneider,

who filed claims around Boulder Canyon and South Dripping
Springs, described his work at Texas Canyon with his father, Fred,
as "miserable" 11 and although his prospecting was done well into
the twentieth century, his descriptions of a miner's life are
probably typical of earlier mining endeavors as well.
Fred Schneider was from Germany and came to the El Paso
area with a partner, George Hohenberger.
One of his first
prospect holes was at Webb Gap, five miles north of Anthony Pass.
Later, he went towards Bishop's Cap, and ended up near Gold Camp,
north of San Augustine Pass, where he opened the Mormon Mine.
His last move was to Texas Canyon, where he operated a prospect
initially owned by a miner named Foy from Organ (Foy n.d.).
Helped by his two sons, George and Pete, Schneider worked in the
canyon until forced to move by the military.
In Schneider's opinion, the Organs represented one of the
best mining districts in the United States.
The Texas Canyon
prospects were successful enough to attract financial backers,
such as Judge Harrington from El Paso, and even prospectors in
Soledad Canyon and south, where there never were any paying mines,
managed to get support.
Many such backers, however, were simply
"crazy for treasure," and prospectors well aware of this would
take the grubstake and spend their time digging useless holes.
Even at a location that was modestly successful, such as
the Texas Canyon diggings, rewards were meager when all the hard
work was done.
On a typical day, the three men rose at daybreak
and had a breakfast of bacon, eggs, and coffee.
Then they would
go to the mine and begin shooting.
George went down a ladder and
set one-and-a-half to two sticks of dynamite in each of the six to
eight holes, lit the fuses, and ran barefooted up the ladder to
rejoin his father and count the explosions.
For three or four days, the Schneiders drilled, shot, and
extracted ore.
At the end of the week, they milled, saving the
best part of the process until late Saturday, when they scraped
off the amalgam and put it in a retort.
The mercury evaporated,
leaving a spongy gold which they put into a furnace and melted
into a small cube.
George Schneider remembered that seeing the gold made him
feel as though all their work during the week might have been
worthwhile.
Even so, the only time to relax was in the evening
when they might sit around camp reading western magazines and
cowboy stories, or on a Saturday night when they went to a dance
in Organ.
The rest of the week was spent in work so hard that
the men often felt physically ill.
And in the end, Fred
Schneider had "made enough to keep going, but not enough to
get out."

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

THE RANCH AT SAN AUGUSTINE: SHEDD, DAVIES, AND COX
Mining was one prong of a two-pronged attack that helped
open the southern Tularosa to settlement.
Livestock raising was
the other.
And livestock in 1866, when Warren Shedd began his
ranch at San Augustine Springs, meant sheep.
Winifred Kupper has pointed out that in the Southwest,
sheep were the real conquerors (1945: 19).
Scrubby, lean, ugly,
the hardy ahurroa of the entrada provided food, clothing, and cash
income to early Spanish and Mexican colonists.
They were the one
indispensable item of frontier life in New Mexico.
-~--Witntnesneepcame a series of elaborate institutions;--- _____
formed in Spain and transplanted to New Mexico, by which the
rights and obligations of sheepmen were defined and regulated.
One of these organizations was the Honorable Assembly of the
Mesta, which was similar, if not identical, to today's sheepmen's
associations (McWilliams 1968: 144).
After the Civil War, Spanish sheepmen along the Rio Grande
Valley were joined by their Anglo counterparts, who not only
recognized the profits which could be accrued by raising sheep for
eastern markets, but also acknowledged the superiority of the
Hispanic system.
They adopted the Hispanic pattern, and with the
help of troops from posts at Stanton, Bliss, and Fillmore,
enlarged the grazing areas by helping to bring the Mescalero
Apache under military control.
It should not be surprising, then, that the first rancher
to brave the unknown Tularosa was a sheepman.
Fifteen years
before the advent of the phenomenal cattle herds of the mid-1880's,
Warren Shedd established a ranch and community at the eastern foot
of San Augustine Pass, and developed a range which officially
extended to sheep camps at the mouth of Soledad Canyon, but more
likely reached as far as his stock could walk without suffering
from a lack of water.
The patron system on which sheep-raising in New Mexico was
based, and which implied a strict social structure, may account
for some of the semi-libelous traditions which surrounded the
ranch at San Augustine.
The pastors who tended Shedd's flocks
were reinterpreted as skulking peons, and the relationship which
existed between master and servant was often interpreted as
implying vassalage by travelers who stopped at Shedd's on their
way to or from the Mesilla Valley.
.
There is no denying that Shedd was something of a mysterious
character.
Born about 1829 in New York State (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1880, Doiia Ana County), he was reported to have served
----in the Mexican War.
Mo re likely, he was the same Warren Shedd
as the lieutenant colonel who commanded the Thirtieth Illinois
Infantry at the Battle of Port Gibson, Mississippi, on May 16,
1863; served at the Siege of Vicksburg; and was captured by
Confederate forces on July 22, 1864 (U.S. War Department I-24-1:
647; I-24-2: 155; 1-38-1; 109).

--~--~----~---------

_ _ _ __

THE RANCH AT SAN AUGUSTINE

129

After the Civil War, Shedd appeared in the Mesilla Valley,
and by 1866 had taken up the land surrounding San Augustine
Springs (Fig. 22).
His establishment was described by Lieutenant
Eugene Griffin of the Wheeler Expedition in 1879:
. Shedd's ranch is widely known in this
country, more so, perhaps, than the more recent
appellation of San Augustin.
It is only within
the last few years that traveling, even in
parties of considerable size, has been safe in
this vicinity, on account of the Indians.
The
erection of military posts and the increased
number of troops have confined the Indians more
closely to their reservations, and the traveler
is now comparatively safe.
The grazing on the
long, gentle slopes is excellent; though not
luxurious, the grass seems to possess great
nutritious properties, and supports a flock of
some 10,000 sheep and several herds of cattle
(U.S. Army.
Engineer Department 1879: 224-2251 13
Just as he capitalized on the grassy plains of San Augustine,
so Shedd also recognized the unique opportunities offered by
his location.
He established a small town, platted and sold rots,
and constructed a number of buildings to house travelers from
El Paso, Las Cruces, and nearby forts, to whom he could offer
water, food, and overnight accomodations.
On January 2, 1874, Shedd sold the core of his ranch to
a CQmpany from Fort Selden comprised of Benjamin Davies and
Henry Lesinsky, who lived in Silver City.
The consideration was
$2,000, for which Shedd deeded over the portion of his ranch
• located immediately above and around
the main and principal spring and springs
II
known as San Augustin [sia] Springs .

l 3

Katherine Stoes stated (1957: 36) that San Augustine Springs
was developed by Thomas Bull who cut lumber for the construct ion of Fillmore; she implied that Shedd bought the
property and buildings from Bull.
Documentary sources do not
support these contentions, however.
The derivation of lumber
tor; Fillmore is explained in a District Court Case (Morris v~
Derosier) in which the defendent, Morris, stated that as
commanding officer of Fillmore, he cut the lumber on public
lands (Dona Ana County, District Court, Civil Cases: November
1855}. Furthermore, none of the early surveys of San Augustine
Springs reported inhabitants nearby, other than Apache Indians.
Shedd is not mentioned in the 1860 Dona Ana County census; and
the next year when Lynde surrendered to Baylor there was no
indication that there were either buildings or inhabitants at
Shedd's future ranch site.

THE RANCH AT SAN AUGUSTINE

133

Exact location of the property was the north half of section 22,
T22S, R4E (Dona Ana County, [Deed] Records E: 583-584).
After selling the springs, Shedd continued to live in San
Augustine.
Furthermore, the ranch lands surrounding the town
remained linked with his name.
He turned from stockraising,
leaving that to Davies and Lesinsky, and catered to the numerous
travelers over the pass (3,200 in the first nine months of 1874,
according to the Mesilla Nehls October 10, 1874: 2).
By 1878, his
ranch had become famous in the Mesilla Valley as a resort for
people afflicted by fever, and he erected a three-story house to
accomodate guests (Thirty-four December 18, 1878: 3).
Five years
later, the Rio Grande Republican touted .the San Augustine Hotel as
one of Do~a Ana County's best-known landmarks.
Shedd, and the
hotel's new proprietors, Forster and Rose, were known to serve
fifty to eighty guests at every meal.
Then, in the cool of the
evening, everyone grouped on the porch, enjoying the breeze, and
11
"watching the moon rise over the distant Sacramentos
14
(February 3, 1883: 1).
As San Augustine's reputation as a resort grew, so also did
Shedd's plans for a new hotel.
Construction started in the spring
of 1883 (Eio Grande Republican April 21, 1883: 1), and by August,
he had two stories completed, both surrounded by porches (Rio
Grande Republican August 18, 1883: 1). A legal document described
the location of the hotel as being on one-half of block 7 on the
plat of San Augustine, and part of the northwest quarter of
section 22, T22S, R4E (Dona Ana County, Mortgage Record 1: 383).
Apparently, Shedd and his wife, Isidra, had to borrow money
from Pat Coghlan in order to pay Henry Forster to complete the
building, a task accomplished by June 1884.
At that point, the
Forsters, who had run the old hotel, moved their operations to
the new one (Rio G:r>ande Republican June 21, 1884: 3).
Eventually,
they took over sole proprietorship from Shedd in a deed which
described a structure of truly magnificent proportions.
Located
in the northwest quarter of section 22, T22S, R4E, nearly one-half
mile west of Benjamin Davies' house, the hotel was adobe, twostory, and measured about eighty-six feet wide by one hundred
thirty-two feet long (Dona Ana County, Deed Record 6: 647). 15
As the years went by, the ranch continued to be known as
Shedd's, but Shedd himself gradually slipped from view.
He
appeared briefly in the pages of the Rio Grande Republican when
he tried to start a business selling canaigre as a tanning

14

Another part of night life at San Augustine was the small
building in the rear of the ranch, "intended for the abode of
11
females whose smiles are for all .
(Rio G:r>ande Republiaqn
February 10, 1883: 3}.

The building was constructed on part of the land Shedd sold to
Davies and Lesinsky.
It is clear from the deed, however, that
Shedd was conveying only the hotel, and not the land on which
it stood.

substance (April 10, 1886: l; June 11, 1887: 3), and again when
he and Foster [sic] bought a herd of about 1,000 Angora goats
which they placed in the Organs (July 3, 1886: 1).
As late as
1887, he apparently hoped to go into the hotel business again
(January 29, 1887: 3).
Shedd's place in the valley, as well as ownership of his
ranch, was taken by a Welshman named Benjamin Davies who, with
the backing of a Jewish merchant named Henry Lesinsky, purchased
and developed the San Augustine property after January 1874.
His
contributions to the history of ranching in the western Tularosa
were four-fold.
First, he took a ranch that had been loosely run,
at best, and shaped it into one of the largest and most profitable
operations in the basin, acquiring water rights and buying up
homesteads.
Secondly, Davies upgraded his stock by introducing
better breeds of sheep, and later, cattle.
Thirdly, he bridged
the span of years between the old and new Tularosa, achieving
profits from the older sheep industry, but successfully adapting
to the tremendous influx of cattle from Texas and Mexico which
occurred throughout the Southwest in the early 1880's.
Finally,
he instigated exploration for permanent water resources, hiring
the basin's first drillers to install wells at Soledad and San
Augustine springs.
His silent partners in this enterprise were two mercantile
brothers named Henry and Morris Lesinsky, and it is likely that
their relationship was similar to those described by William
Parish (1960: 14) in which older, established firms such as the
Lesinskys' often provided the capital to start a younger businessman.
Whatever the initial relationship, however, Davies could
not have had better partners.
Henry Lesinsky, particularly, was
well-known for his business sense, as well as his success with
wholesale and retail goods throughout New Mexico, Texas, Arizona,
and Chihuahua (The Borderer December 13, 1871: 2).
Davies, like h~s predecessor at San Augustine, was something
of a mystery.
We know that he was probably born in Wales about
1828.
During the Civil War, he was a member of the California
Volunteers, Company D, First Regiment of Cavalry.
He enrolled
in Marysville, California, and enlisted September 6, 1861.
On
October 8, 1864, he mustered out at Fort Union, New Mexico, at
the expiration of his term of service (Orton 1890: 117, 119).
He
was a resident of Las Cruces by at least 1869, when he purchased
from Joseph Cox a ranch known as the Halfway House, located
midway between Las Cruces and Hart's Mills, and containing about
160 acres (»o~a Ana County, Deed Record 4: 17).
By 1870, Davies was working as a bookkeeper for Henry
Lesinsky (U.S. Bureau of th_e Gens.us 1870, .Dona Ana Cotintt)~~
although it is not clear how long that particular relationship
lasted, the two men were partners in a company at Fort Selden by
the time thsy bought the portion of Shedd's Ranch located
immediately above and around the San Augustine Springs (Don'.a Ana
County, IDeed] Records E: 583-584).
At the end of a year, Davies had settled in at San Augustine

with his wife, Julia, and daughters Jessie (future wife of
Jonathan Wildy) and Effie.
A reporter from the Mesilla News
visited the Davies family and wrote that Davies had started with
a band of the "very lowest native sheep" but had crossed them with
finer breeds; within a few years, his flocks would probably
compare favorably with those in the states (February 20, 1875: 2).
After four years, Benjamin Davies had a herd of 9,000 to
10,000 improved sheep (Thirty-four February 12, 1879: 2).
His
wool cut during tha fall season alone was about 20,000 pounds,
and hi s s he e p were des crib e d as b e in g in ::; p 1 e.n d id_ con d i t ion
(Thirty-four November 12, 1879: 3) even though a lack-of rain was
causing some hardship, and Apache Indians. harassed his herders.
If the 1870's represented a time during which Davies
concentrated on the accumulation and improvement of sheep breeds,
the 1880's was a decade during which he solidified his land
holdings.
In April and May 1880, he received a homestead certificate covering the Ne~ of section 22, T22S, R4E, a half interest
in which he sold to Henry and Charles Lesinsky and Julius
Freudenthal a year-and-a-half later (Do~a Ana County, Deed Record
5: 89-90, 459-460).
In 1883, he and Julia apparently took
another member of the Lesinsky clan, Morris, as a partner, for
on May 10, they joined in purchasing Edward H. Griffin's
interest in the Sw~ of section 24, T23S, R4E, a piece of land at
the mouth of Soledad (Dona Ana County, Deed Record 6: 169).
This was probably the land described in 1883 as Davies' and
Lesinsky's Ranch at Sodeda[d] Canyon (Do~a Ana County, Location
No. 5: 190, 191), and in 1890 as the "stone corell [sic] and .
lumber house known as the Davies Ranch" (Do~a Ana County, Mining
Claims No. 6: 165).
The 1880's also were the years when Davies and Lesinsky
began to emphasize cattle raising and the improvement of cattle
breeds. 16
In January 1883, they brought in about twenty head of
pure-blooded cattle, each with ''a pedigree as lonf as the moral
law" (Rio Grande Republican January 20, 1883: 3). 7
And to all
appearances, their timing could not have been better.
Rainfall
during 1883 and 1884 was plentiful; grass was excellent.
In
fact, that winter was a good one for cattlemen throughout the
Tularosa.
Unfortunately, an overabundance of both commodities
encouraged an overreaction, aptly expressed in the equation:

1 6

Davies had abandoned sheep-raising by 1885 (Rio Grande

Republican February 28, 1885: 4).
1 7

According to another San Augustine stockman, Apolonio Vigil,
the bull most preferred when attempting to upgrade native stock
was the Hereford.
In 1885, he stated that "people who have had
any experience in grading cattle, say they make the best range
cattle" (Vigil 1885: 2).

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

The more rain, the more grass; the more grass,
the more cattle; the more cattle, the more
money; the more money, the more - - - - (Rio
Grande Republican July 12, 1884: 3).
It seemed so simple, so logical.
But in fact, some parts of the
range were already suffering.
The June roundup at Three Rivers
was highly successful, but southwest, on Davies' range, rainfall
was only barely adequate.
A good rain on the east side of the
Organs during the third week in July, and another one three weeks
later, meant that Davies and Lesinsky would not have to move the
greater portion of their cattle to the Rio Grande.
But the
temporary scare had encouraged a Las Cruces newspaper to advise
against bringing any more cattle into the southern Tularosa
before permanent water facilities were installed (Rio Grande
Republican July 26, 1884: 2; September 20, 1884: 2).
During the next two years, Davies acted quickly and
decisively to assure that he would not be caught in the future,
as he had been in 1884, with insufficient water for his herds.
He started in April or May of 1885 by purchasing and installing
a hot air pump near the headquarters to raise water for stock
(Rio Grande Republican May 2, 1885: 3).
To protect what water he
had, he filed suit against Mayer Halff, a wealthy Texas cattleman
who had taken up land and water south of Soledad Canyon, and was
now allowing his herds to infringe on Davies' water and lands,
probably near Globe Springs (Rio Grande Republican July 10, 1886:
2).
Davies also participated actively in the search for permanent
water supplies in the basin by hiring well drillers such as the
Comery brothers 19 and Frank Hickox.
At the San Augustine headquarters, for example, the Comerys bored three wells, the third
one of which went down 100 feet and filled to within 30 feet of
the top.
Another well at Soledad was 63 feet deep and contained
55 feet of water (Rio Grande Republican April 24, 1886: 3).
The special attention paid to the development of water at
the mouth of Soledad Canyon and San Augustine Springs clearly
delineates the extent of Benjamin Davies' and Morris Lesinsky's
holdings by 1890.
At the headquarters, they had 160 improved
acres in the Ne~ of section 22, T22S, R4E.
They had obtained
eighty acres at present-day Condron Field on White Sands in two
separate transactions: forty acres in the Se~ NE~ of section 35, T22S,
R5E, from William A. Smith on July 21, 1888; and forty acres in
the Ne~ Se~ of section 35, T22S, R5E, from John C. and Nancy May
on July 25, 1888 (Fig. 22, #10).
On Do~a Ana Range proper, they
owned another 160 improved acres in the Sw~ of section 24, T23S,
R4E at the mouth of Soledad (Dona Ana County, Deed Record 12:
5-8; Do~a Ana County, County Assessor: 1886).
By the early 1890's, the ranch at San Augustine had entered

a new era.
Benjamin Davies had died.
Morris Lesinsky lived
hundreds of miles away in Alameda County, California, and could
hardly have provided the firm hand such an enormous spread
required.
Eventually, management of the ranch passed to Davies'
son-in-law, Jonathan Wildy, who had financial problems of his
own, and appears to have spent as much time in Roberts County,
Texas, with his wife and Julia Davies, as he did in Dona Ana
County.
And so the arrival of a young Texas named W. W. Cox in 1893
was propitious; his purchase and strong management of the San
Augustine Ranch somewhat inevitable.
It may have been that his
mentor, Mayer Halff, had been keeping his eye on the Davies Ranch
to the north; he certainly provided backing which helped Cox to
purchase and run it.
But even with such help, had Cox not been
so eminently suited to the job, the ranch would probably have
gone the way of dozens of others in the difficult years ahead.
Cox's background was suspect, to say the least.
He was one
of five children born to James and Mary Cox of DeWitt County,
Texas; his birthdate was November 12, 1854 (Mullin 1977).
The
cause for his precipitous entry into New Mexico was a somewhat
indirect one - which is to say that Jim Cox had become embroiled
in a family feud, and William had had the misfortune of following
in his father's footsteps. 19
Around 1870, Jim Cox became a member of the Regulators, a
group sanctioned by the Texas Legislature and organized by Jack
Helm.
The Regulators were empowered to round up members of the
Taylor family who had killed two Yankee soldiers in November 1867.
In a short time, however, it was difficult to distinguish
between the law-breakers and the law-enforcers.
What had started
as politics grew into a feud, and Jim Cox, as one of those who
had sided with the Sutton faction, was killed in 1873 as he was
returning home from Helena, seat of Karnes County, to answer
murder charges.
In the course of the Sutton-Taylor Feud, which lasted
thirty years and was the longest and bloodiest in Texas, an
entirely new generation of young men grew up ready to fight over
issues whDse beginnings they didn't even remember.
W. W. Cox
was one of these, and in 1876 he was indicted with six other men
for the murder of Dr. Philip Brassell, and of his son, George,
who had been suspected in the killing of Jim Cox.
The accused men
were taken in by Captain Lee Hall of the Texas Rangers.
On April 17, 1878, Cox and two other men were convicted of
the first degree murder of Dr. Brassell, and later the Court of
Appeals in San Antonio affirmed the verdict.
Fate stepped in at
this point, however, and a clerk lost the judgment.
The case was
reopened, and the judgment reversed because one word in the
indictment was wrong, making Cox's one of the more celebrated
cases in the legal history of Texas.

19

The particulars of the Sutton-Taylor Feud are taken from
Sonnichen (1962: 35-115).

138

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

After the reversal in 1880, Cox was granted bail and
quickly headed west.
In the Big Bend country he went to work for
a San Antonio merchant and cattleman, Mayer Halff.
A few years
later, Cox and his wife moved northwest to the San Andres
Mountains and settled in Bear Canyon.
But his relationship with
Halff remained firm.
While Cox moved around in the next few
years--to Gallup and then near Cooke's Peak--Halff became Benjamin
Davies' neighbor just south of Soledad Canyon.
Later, when the
San Augustine property came up for sale, Halff ~acked Cox, and
may have played a role in his early business similar to the one
Henry Lesinsky had filled for Davies. 20
W. W. Cox's purchase of the San Augustine Ranch occurred
on September 9, 1893, when he agreed to pay $10,000 to Numa
Reymond 21 (trustee for Morris Lesinsky and Julia E. Davies) for:
1) 160 acres around San Augustine Springs, 2) 160 acres one mile
northwest of Globe Springs, 3) 40 acres just north of presentday Condron Field, 4) the Hidden Treasure Mining Claim about six
miles northeast of the San Augustine Ranch, 5) the Home Mining
Claim two miles north from Organ, 6) a one-half interest in
twenty-four thoroughbred Hereford bulls branded ::F-W on the left
side, 7) all cattle branded .JZf..
on the right side and .I:::L.
on the left, and earmarked ~ above 100 head and within a
circumscribed area, 8) all horses branded .CJ.. on the left rump,
together with miscellaneous horses branded C,./J
W
, or J-1..J
, and 9) all cattle branded _J:J.. on the right side only,
and earmarked crop and under-half crop in each ear.
This last
batch of cattle were located on a range defined as:
. . west and south of the line beginning
at the southeast corner of Do~a Ana County
and running north along the east line of Dona
Ana County about 35 miles to the foothills
of the Sacramento Mountains, thence northwest to the nearest point on the summit of
the Sacramento, Pe~asco, and White mountains,
leaving towns of Weed, Silver Spring Canon,
and Elk Springs east of the said line, and
the Sacramento Ri~er, Fresnal Canon, and
Mescalero Indian Agency west of the said

2 0

There is every indication that Halff, a cattleman of impeccable
reputation, played a major part in Cox's success after the
Texas fiasco, and that the sense of friendship was strongly
reciprocated.
Cox named a son for Halff, and after the
cattleman's death helped handle his property in the Organs.

line, to Sierra Blanca Peak; thence west to
the Pacific Coast (Dona Ana County, Deed
Record 16: 345-347). 22
This, then, was Cox's range, a potential empire that spread out
from the foot of the Organ Mountains, south to the Texas line,
east to the Huecos, into the Sacramentos on the north, and west
again.
From the very start, Cox was aggressive about holding onto
his land, buying up neighboring claims, and arranging water
sources for his cattle.
His first important purchase on Dona
Ana Range occurred on February 20, 1896r when he paid Thomas G.
and Ida Hendrick $1,000 for the future site of the Globe Springs
Ranch (Fig. 22, #13) (Dona Ana County, Deed Record 18: 3-4). 23
Simultaneously, he made a series of deals with his new brotherin-law, Oliver Lee, for water rights around Tularosa.
Ultimately,
they concluded a contract made on November 13, 1901, in which
the two men effectively divided up the southern Tularosa Basin.
They agreed to construct a division fence so that Lee's cattle
would use water and range east, and Cox's cattle would use water
and range west, of a line running south from Township 19 South
between Ranges 11 and 12 East (Otero County, Record Leases &
Contracts No. 1: 116-118).
After 1901, Cox seems to have concentrated on developing
the portion of his ranch lying west of the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad.
He purchased the area around Parker Lake in
1903 from the Seabergs [sic] (Fig. 22, #14) (Dalia Ana County,
Deed Record 23: 510-512), from whom W. N. Fleck was to buy his
South Well property in 1917; and sold off Cox's Wells (later the
Sacramento River Cattle Company's commissary location on
McGregor Range) to Edwin S. Pennebaker (Otero County, Deed
Record 6: 307-308).
He bought more acreage in the vicinity of
Headquarters, and in 1919 bought some Organ Mountain Mining District claims from various family members (Dalia Ana County,
Deed Record 51: 395; Otero County, Mining Deed Record No. 33:
227-228).
Cox's purchase of mineral claims was one of the first
indications of an interest which ultimately resulted in losses

22

The described boundaries conform closely to the combined
holdings of Davies, Lesinsky, and Wildy; the brands, such
as the Jarilla Hat and JW connected were both Wildy's,
indicating the extent to which the two families appear to
have pooled their holdings after Wildy's marriage to Jessie
Davies.

23

The Hendricks had thems.elves purchased some of Wildy' s
stock on September 20, 1893 (Dona Ana County, Deed Record
16: 411-412).

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

of large amounts of capital.
Swept up in the oil excitement that
hit the Tularosa in 1919, Cox incorporated The W. W. Cox Oil
Company (no stockholders' liability).
The purpose of the company
was to develop petroleum, oil, and gas resources, to sell the
products, and to deal in the necessary land.
Authorized
capital was $100,000 (later amended to $200,000), and the
corporation life was to have been fifty years (Dona Ana County,
Record of Incorporation 1: 639-640, 646).
Armed with the certainty that there must be oil in the
basin, Cox poured thousands of dollars into a few holes, at least
one of which, the Cox State, was located on present-day Do~a Ana
Range just south of Globe Well in section 26, T23S, R5E. 24
And although he never hit oil, nothing could shake his faith in
its existence.
Unsuccessful oil exploration took its toll.
So did the
failure of the Bowman Bank in Las Cruces, of which Cox was
president and in which he held large amounts of stock.
The final
blow came when he was hit by heavy cattle losses during a drought
in the early 1920's.
Hal Cox, a son, remembers that the ranch
sustained large losses in 1921, and attempts to save their cattle
by moving them west to the pastures of Corralitos failed.
After
that year, the family never again branded so many head (El Paso
Herald January 1, 1924: 5; Cox and Dayberry 1977). 25
When W. W. Cox died in Las Cruces on December 31, 1923, he
left a ranch in trouble, but a family that still had the two
things necessary to rebuild: water and land.
An inventory filed
with the county clerk listed 1,200 acres of patented land; 3,075.53
acres purchased from the State of New Mexico; 22,133.25 acres
leased from the state; one adobe house at San Augustine; 2,000
head of range stock; 25 head of saddle horses; 30 head of range
mares; and miscellaneous harness, windmills, engines, and barbed
wire fences (Dona Ana County, Probate File No. 396).
The Cox family immediately began to regroup their forces.
They formed a new corporation, Cox Bros., Inc. (no stockholders'
liability), with capital stock of $50,000, a life of fifty years,
and objects of engaging in every activity that could possibly be
involved in running an enormous ranch.
The company agent was
Hal Cox, and under his direction and that of his brothers, James
W. and Albert B., the San Augustine Ranch began the road back to
prosperity (Dona Ana County, Record of Incorporation 2: 240).

24

Other wells on Dona Ana included the Parker State, a dry hole
in section 15, T23S, R5E; and Viking State (show of oil) in
section 26, T23S, R5E (Bieberman n.d.).

2 5

Cox (Cox and Dayberry, 1977) pointed out that while the number
of head decreased, individual poundage increased.
One year,
hands branded 700 calves that weighed more than 2,000 head
from an earlier year.

THE RANCH AT SAN AUGUSTINE

141

In the years between W. W. Cox's death in 1923, and the
condemnation of the bulk of the ranch by the government after
World War II, growth was steady.
One of the areas that developed
was on Do~a Ana Range around Globe Pasture.
Overseer for the
pasture was Joe Wiegel, who hired on with the Coxes just after
W. W. Cox died.
He worked on the ranch for about nine years, and
then moved with his wife to a small frame house built by a homesteader named Jack Ormond, and located about a mile west of Globe
Well back up near the Organs.
A pipeline ran about three quarters
of a mile from Globe Springs out onto the flats, and terminated
near the Globe Well and a set of corrals (Wiegel and Wiegel 1977),
where it flowed into a steel tank at the rate of about two gallons
per minute (Meinzer and Hare 1915: 255).
Joe Wiegel recalls 27 that Globe Springs between Glendale and
Pete Johnson canyons had been walled up and developed before he
moved to the area.
Also, there were some early wells near both
canyons (perhaps those drilled by Davies around 1886), and a well
east of their house, adjacent to present-day War Highway 11,
which was drilled about 1921-1922.
All of the sites--the two
Globe Wells, Globe Springs, and the Wiegel's house--were within
the bounds of Globe Pasture, as was the three-room frame house of
W. B. Rhode, Mrs. Cox's father, which burned about 1936 or 1937.
The entire area took in about fifteen or sixteen sections between
the outlet of Soledad Canyon and Globe Well to the east. 28
The Wiegels' life at Globe Springs was typical of ranch life
throughout the basin.
They got up at daybreak and finished the
day when the work was through.
When they needed supplies they
generally went to Las Cruces over San Augustine Pass.
In many
ways, they were self-sufficient.
They kept chickens--those the
coyotes didn't carry off--and a milk cow.
Following Rhode's
example, they grew an orchard with apricots and peaches where the
pipeline from Globe Springs discharged.
Wiegel was in charge of Globe Pasture, but he also helped
out anywhere else he was needed on the ranch.
Some cattle drives
went to El Paso; others went to the railroad at Leasburg, north
of Las Cruces.
To get there, the hands took the herds across San

26

26

Apparently, there were two Globe wells: one in section 23, and
one at the Globe Springs Ranch, both in T23S, R5E.
According
to Meinzer and Hare (1915: 255) the original Globe Springs was
a short distance north of the 1915 supply.

2 7

Information about the Globe Springs portion of the Cox Ranch
is taken from Wiegel and Wiegel (1977), except where otherwise
indicated.

Tom Dayberry, a nephew of Hal Cox, recalled that the Globe Well
at Globe Pasture was the deepest well on the Cox Ranch, being
300 feet deep (Cox and Dayberry 1977).

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

Augustine Pass and camped out the first night at Will Isaacks'
ranch on the flats west of the Organs.
Until the mid-thirties,
thousands of Cox cattle were driven to market this way.
Then
trucking began, and the cattle could be picked up on the ranch.
The Cox Ranch at San Augustine probably could have lasted
indefinitely, because despite the vagaries of weather and cattle
markets, the ranch was a well-run, profitable business.
But
at the end of World War II, nothing would do but that the
government must have the bulk of the ranch.
The southern portion,
including Globe Springs, was taken first and used as part of
Dona Ana Range.
The area around the house was next, as part of
White Sands, but a quirk of fate allowed the family to keep the
home they had lived in for almost sixty years.
BOUNTIFUL TIMES: RANCHING IN THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS
Cox's was probably the most prosperous ranch that used part
of Dona Ana Range.
And it was small wonder.
He had the springs,
and surveyors' reports from 1858 to the mid-1880's indicated that
his land had a good covering of grama and other grasses.
The
bulk of Do~a Ana, on the other hand, was typified by abundant
mesquite, rolling sand hills, and rugged mountains.
What the Organs did provide in plentiful quantities, whether
at Globe Springs or in the deep valleys further west, was water,
and if the mountain slopes were too rocky for cattle, they
were perfe~t for sheep and goats.
Some of the families and
individuals who used the area were the Isaacks and Beasleys, the
Moody broth£ra, Jeff Ake, and Mayer Halff.
For the most part,
they all prospered.
The most successful stockman in the Organs was W. W. Cox's
friend, Mayer Half£, who was described by the Rio Grande Republican
as being, with Benjamin Davies, the "cattle king" of the east
side (July 3, 1886: 1).
Half£ spent most of his time in San
Antonio running a mercantile business with his brother, Solomon,
or in Brewster County, Texas, where he owned the 50,000-acre
Circle Dot Ranch. 29
But sometime around 1885 he must have
decided to expand his tremendous holdings by moving into the Organ
Mountains.
He took Sam Taylor as his partner--an eastside miner
familiar with the territory--and bought, from:__ John L. and
Margaret Cook of Harrison County, Missouri, 120 acres located
in the Sw~ Sw~ of section 34, T23S, R4E; and in the Sw~ Ne~ of
section 7 and the Nw~ Sw~ of section 9, T24S, R4E.
The first
parcel was on the northern end of Rattlesnake Ridge, the future
site of the Dripping Springs Ranch (Fig. 22, #6); the second was

near the merger of Long and Finley canyons (Fig. 22, #8); and
the third on the west side of Boulder Canyon (Fig. 22, #7).
It
is likely that at the time Halff bought the land there was either
flowing water, springs, or the promise of shallow-water wells on
all three pieces of property.
Halff and Taylor divided the responsibilities of their
ranch: Halff bought the property and Taylor developed the water.
The Rio Grande Republican for March 21, 1885, remarked that
Taylor had taken iron pipe to the Organ Mountain ranch "with
which he will pipe water from his springs to the watering troughs
for stock." A little later in the year, the partners hired Lew
Kelsey to sink a well "on a ranch below the Soledad" (Rio Grande
Republican October 24, 1885: 3).
Meanwhile, Halff was buying cattle or bringing them in from
his Texas ranches.
He leased part of the Brazito Grant and held
several thousand head of cattle on it (Rio Grande Republican
December 5, 1885: 3).
Sometimes he placed them in the Organs;
on another occasion he drove them to the Weems Ranch in the Burro
Mountains (Rio Grande Republican April 16, 1887: 1).
He appears
to have used the Do~a Ana property for at least half-a-dozen
years, and his family held on to the land until 1909 when they
finally sold it to A. M. Kezer for $500.00 (Dona Ana County, Deed
Record 33: 245).
While Mayer Halff was primarily a cattle raiser, several
other stockmen concentrated on sheep and goats.
The Moody
Brothers and Jeff Ake were sheep raisers who were roughly
contemporaneous with Halff.
They also operated about the same
time as Benjamin Davies at San Augustine.
In fact, the four men
butted up on one another in range, with the Moodys and Ake
controlling the mountains around Soledad Canyon east to Globe
Springs, Davies picking up the range at Globe and following the
mountain flanks north to San Augustine Pass, and the Moodys
again appearing on the other side and operating from sheep camps
on the north side of the pass.
Sheep corrals, such as those used
by all four ur:eD near Globe Sp rings, provide material evidence of
their activities along the entire eastern face of the Organs.
Ake once said that the Moody's, "two old men," were already
living in Soledad when he moved there in the mid-eighties.
Their
names were Henry and T. J., and their rock house probably stood
on or near the site of the present J. D. Isaacks house, mid-way up
the canyon (Fig. 22, #9).
Jeff Ake's claim was down canyon, and
wasn't actually a homestead, but rather a mineral claim, "the
easiest way to hold land there." Ake was given forty head of
cattle, and bought 800 head of sheep which he drove up Soledad.
Then he made a deal with the Moodys to supply them with rams and
salt while they tended his flock (O'Neil 1935: 145-146).
Apparently, it was difficult to support a family on the
proceeds of a limited livestock business, and so the men often
took work in a nearby town.
Ake occasionally worked for other
cattlemen, such as John H. Riley at the Cuevas, or Max Goldenberg

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

(Rio Grande RepubZiaan May 16, 1885: 3; July 4, 1885: 2).
He
earned fairly good wages as a miner (U.S. Bureau of Census, 1885,
Dona Ana County).
Eventually, however, all three families ended
by dividing their time between Soledad, and Las Cruces or Organ
where their children attended school.
In late March the Rio
Grande RepubZiaan announced that "Mr. Jeff Ake and family and Mr.
Henry Moody and family of Soledad, will remove in a few days to
Organ to reside" (March 28: 2).
The Moodys continued to be interested in Soledad Canyon
throughout the 1880's, prospecting for minerals when they weren't
tending their flocks (Do1la Ana County, Location No. 5: 802).
But
eventually, a chance came along to sell out, and they took it.
In 1888, two families named Beasley and Isaacks came to the
Organ Mountains from Texas.
They were part of what the Rio Grande
RepubZiaan noted as a large migration which had been instigated
by severe droughts in Texas in 1886.
They had heard that there
was free land near Magdalena, and feeling that they had a chance
to start afresh, they began the long trek which eventually ended
in the quiet solitude of Soledad Canyon (May 10, 1886: 2; July
3, 1886: 2).
The two families had similar Southern backgrounds.
The
Isaacks originated in North Carolina, and Texas was where most of
the children were born.
By 1870, they had settled in Erath
County on Paloxy Creek.
Nancy Isaacks, thirty-seven, was
raising four children and making a living for all of them as a
farmer (U.S. Bureau of Census 1870: Erath County), a function her
son, Jefferson D., had taken over by 1880.
Two counties away, the Beasleys had recently emigrated from
Alabama.
In 1880, George Beasley's family consisted of himself;
his wife, Virginia; their two sons, Austin and Amos; a mother-inlaw, Mary E. Briley; and brother-in-law, Gorden [sic] A.
Briley (U.S. Bureau of Census 1880: Brown County).
It is unclear when the Isaacks began their move to New
Mexico, but the Beasleys took five or six years to immigrate.
Excited by news of good cattle country and free land, they set out
in a covered wagon with a few head of livestock.
From time to
time, they would make brief stops along the way, the two older men
using the opportunity to earn a little extra money at odd jobs.
They finally arrived in the Sacramento Mountains in the late fall
of 1887, and joined up with the Isaacks (Clay 1977).
About June or July 1888, after a hard winter of deep snows,
the two families left the Sacramentos and trekked across the
Tularosa Basin to Mayer Halff's range in Boulder Canyon.
They
settled in at South Dripping Springs where the Beasleys built a
little rock and mud house and began to scout around for land.
As
luck would have it, their arrival coincided with the Moody's
decision to leave Soledad Canyon, and so George Beasley and J. D.
Isaacks pooled their resources and bought them out.
The Isaacks
moved into a rock and mud house about half way up Soledad, where
James Isaacks patented the Ne~ Sw~ of section 21, T23S, R4E,

RANCHING IN THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS

145

containing forty acres in 1892; and his brother, Jefferson D.,
patented 120 acres nearby, in the Nw~ Sw~ of section 21, and the
E~ Se~ of section 20, T23S, R4E, in 1893 (Dona Ana County, Deed
Record 16: 146-147, 371-372).
The Beasleys ventured further down
canyon, locating a spring, but retaining the right to run their
stock on the Isaacks' property (Fig. 22, #11) (Clay 1977).
Life in Soledad must have been an idyllic conclusion to the
long, hard trip from Texas and the disappointments in the
Sacramentos.
The canyon was one of the most beautiful in the
Organs, and unlike later ranchers on the flats to the east, no
early inhabitants of Soledad ever had to worry about water.
Springs flowed the length of the canyon, and winter snows usually
assured plentiful water throughout the year.
Game abounded,
and if the country was too rough for large herds of cattle, it
was excellent for sheep and goats.
Mountain lions caused problems,
but the ability of J. D. Isaacks and George Beasley to track the
cats down became legendary among their neighbors.
Within ten
years, the two men had killed over fifty lions (Clay 1977;
Raynor 1971).
On August 1, 1898, J, D. Isaacks purchased John H. Riley's
ranch on the western slope of the Organs (Dona Ana County, Deed
Record 20: 53).
His move left the Beasleys the largest group of
permanent residents in Soledad Canyon, and within twenty-five
years they had solidly blocked up the area.
In 1900, George and
Sarah Beasley and eight of their twelve chi1dren 30 settled at a
homestead purchased from Ezekiel C. and the late Amanda Rucker
who had patented the land in 1898 (Fig. 22, #12) (Dona Ana
County, Deed Record 21: 45, 46-47).
Located in the S~ Nw~, the
Ne~ Sw~, and the Nw~ Se~ of section 23, T23S, R4E, the property
was about a mile east of what the Beasleys called the Old Place.
It was nestled in among huge boulders by Soledad Creek, and had
a breathtaking view of the Tularosa Basin to the east.
Up canyon were eighty acres Beasley purchased in 1916 from
Jesus Mart!nez, a goatherder for Nemecia Ascarate (Clay 1977;
Dona Ana County, Deed Record 57: 381).
Still further west was
the Isaacks' rock house, which a couple named Max and Minnie
Morgan had moved into while they prospected in the area (Beasley
1977b).
Immediately north, across the arroyo, was Joicy Beasley
Markham's property which included the family cemetery for the

The Beasley children were Austin, born in Alabama in 1878; Amos,
born in Texas in 1880, died at the Old Place in 1895 of
pneumonia; Evalyn, born in Texas in 1882; Albert Houston, born
in Texas in 1884; Emily, born in Texas in 1886, died at the

South Dripping Springs; Joicy, born in 1892; William Foster,

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

Isaacks and Beasleys.
Her house, constructed by the slip-form
method, was a simple structure which was sited on a hill above
Soledad Creek.
It was located on part of 320 acres she patented
in 1918 in portions of sections 19, 20, and 30 in T23S, R4E
(Beasley 1977b; Dona Ana County, Deed Record 58: 167-168).
West of Joicy Markham was Albert Houston Beasley's home
(Fig. 22, #20) which consisted of another slip-form, four-room
concrete house, an outhouse, rock sheds, and a hand-dug well about
twenty feet deep, walled with concrete and rock.
Because it was
locat~d near the creek bed, the well walls extended above ground
level four or five feet.
When flood waters occasionally spilled
into the well, it had to be bailed out and cleaned.
Beasley
initially operated the well by hand; later he installed a water
pump with a gasoline, one-cylinder pump engine (Beasley 1977b).
South of Albert Houston Beasley, and extending into the upper
reaches of Boulder Canyon, were 320 more acres patented by George
Beasley in 1918 (Fig. 22, #24); while four years later, his son,
Foster, patented 320 acres which ran south of the Rucker Place
starting at the southernmost point of the Cox fence and continuing along the face of the Organ Mountains about one-and-aquarter miles (Fig. 22, #26).
Finally, in 1926, Albert patented
another 480 acres located in the northern portion of Long Canyon
in the Se~ Sw~ of section 30 and the E~ Nw~, Ne~ Sw~, and E~ of
section 31, T23S, R4E (Fig. 22, #28) (Do~a Ana County, Deed Record
58: 166-167; Deed Record 64: 341-342; Deed Record 74: 266-267).
Prospecting and stockraising were the two activities which
occupied most of the Beasleys all of the time.
Iva Clay, daughter
of George Beasley, couldn't remember a time when her father didn't
carry a pick and sack with him as he walked through the mountains
(Clay 1977).
He had started prospecting early, occasionally
throwing in with E. C. Rucker or the Schneiders.
Some of the
holes he either discovered or provided witness to were the
Good Hope Mine (relocation) about one mile east of the Davies
stone corral and lumber house (1890) (Fig. 21, #6), the Poor Boy
Mine one half mile west of Dripping Springs (1890) (Fig. 21, #7),
the Freman [sic] Defeat near the Good Hope on Soledad Creek
(1891), and the Soledad Gold Mining Claim near the mouth of
Soledad Canyon (1908).
The Carara Mine was located east of Dripping Springs in 1910, while George Beasley was in partnership with
A. F. Schneider, Austin Beasley, C. J. and Walter Rasamussen, and
George Hohenberger (Fig. 21, #6) (Dona Ana County, Mining Claims
No. 6: 165, 293-294; Mining Claims No. 9: 234, 382). 31
If interest in prospecting ever flagged, it could usually

Fred Schneider was especially active in Boulder Canyon about
this time.
In July 1912, he discovered the Barytes No. 1 and
No. 2, both one-half to one mile southwest of South Dripping
Springs (Dona Ana County: Mining Claims No. 9: 582, 583).

be revived by the groups of miners and treasure hunters who
periodically came through Soledad to look, and to stay with the
George Beasleys.
The Morgans at the old Isaacks place were
permanent fixtures, but there were other people who came from El
Paso and the Mesilla Valley.
Monahan's and Ballinger's mines
near the Rucker Place were named for the men who claimed them and
then dug dozens of holes in the vicinity.
For years, a man named
Lucas came by with his burros.
Others looked for the lost Padre
La Rue Mine, and Jim Beasley remembers Mexican nationals who came
by the Rucker Place even through the 1930's to ask his father
about the area.
Their interest in the Beasley's place stemmed
from the fact that a document describing ~he location of a lost
mine mentioned tules nearby, and the only tules in the area were
on George Beasley's land near a lean-to used by the Morgans
CB ea s 1 e y 1 9 7 7 b , C1 a y 1 9 7 7) .
But prospecting could hardly put meat on the table, and so
all of the Beasleys were stock-raisers--a more profitable, if
mundane, occupation.
According to Iva Clay, George Beasley
started ranching with sheep, and it is possible that a purchase
of 339 head for $340 from William Dessauer and A. G. Smith of
Las Cruces on June 11, 1890, represented his initiation into
sheep raising (Beasley various dates; Clay 1977).
Later, around
the turn of the century, he diversified, keeping not only sheep,
but some cattle which he penned up in the stone corrals at the
Rucker Place (Clay 1977).
After 1900, the Beasleys seem to have emphasized goat
raising.
They owned at least 1,700 head of high grade Angoras in
1906; at one time, Iva Clay remembered that her father had about
2,000 goats under open range, a situation that didn't always
please their neighbor to the north, W. W. Cox (Dona Ana County,
Chattel Mortgage 4: 34; Clay 1977).
Although George Beasley kept some cattle prior to World War
I (he had at least 300 head in 1907), he concentrated on raising
them only after 1918 when he sold his goats.
At the Rucker Place
he kept about 400 head, and they ranged up and down Soledad
Canyon and out towards Globe Pasture to the east (Dona Ana
County, Mortgage Record 8: 388; Clay 1977).
With the produce from their herds, the Beasleys were almost
self-sufficient on their Soledad homesteads.
They kept pigs, and
always had a milk cow or two.
There was a garden at the Rucker
Place where they grew peaches, corn, and what other vegetables
they needed.
Water for the garden was taken from a pipeline that
worked by gravity flow from a spring one mile distant, or from
Soledad Creek which was sometimes known to flow past the front
door of the house, and continue through Globe Pasture to fill
Davies Lake west of the Cox headquarters.
Other needs were
taken care of in the course of six-day round trips to El Paso,
forty mi.les distant from the Rucker Place, or by summoning Dr.
Johnson from Organ, twenty-three miles away (Beasley 1976;
Clay 1977; Johnson n.d.).

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

Eventually, as the children grew up and needed schooling, the
Beasleys faced the same problems that the Moodys and Jeff Ake had.
For two or three winters, Mrs. Beasley took the children to El
Paso; another time, she rented a house in Las Cruces.
But Iva
Clay remembers that in the end they got precious little education.
"All we got to know was by the hills--being out in the hills"
(Clay 1977).
George Beasley died in Mesquite on February 5, 1931 (Dona
Ana County, Probate File No. 712: Affidavit of Custodian of Will).
His body was brought up from the west side and buried in the
Beasley-Isaacks cemetery beside those of his children, Emily and
Amos.
Another son, Robert, took over the,Rucker Place and raised
his own family there.
A new generation was growing up in Soledad
now, and most of the grandchildren of George and Sarah Beasley
intended to share in the life they and their parents had always
known.
In 1940, the Beasleys received their first intimation that
the life they had taken for granted was threatened.
Desiring to
expand the territory it had acquired south of Soledad Canyon
between 1911 and 1920, the United States Government approached
Robert Beasley with a co-use proposal.
Under the terms of the
agreement, the Army would use the Beasleys' land and four-room
house, but the Beasleys would be able to graze their livestock
in Soledad.
The agreement was to run from December 1, 1940, to
June 30, 1941, and be renewed yearly until June 30, 1951.
Annual rental for the land was $1,352.88 (Anonymous n.d.: App. 4).
On February 10, 1945, the Beasleys were told to evacuate
their house.
Ten days later, they were informed that the
government wanted their land on an exclusive-use basis.
The
implication of the agreement was that the Beasleys could not use
their land for grazing purposes and they could not live on it.
Oddly enough, the amount of money offered for exclusive use was
dramatically less--by almost one-half--than that for co-use.
Naturally, the Beasleys refused the contract, and within a year
the government had all but condemned the property.
The initial appraisal of the property was unacceptably low,
and after years of fighting the condemnation action in the
courts, the Beasleys were left with less than $15,000.
The money
was not enough to begin over again, and Beasley, who had always
worked for himself, now had to find work with neighboring ranchers
out of the Range boundary.
He died in a county hospital in
Phoenix, Arizona, in 1963.
His wife, who died soon after, never
did recover from her sense of b~tterness and loss.
RANCHING ON THE FLATS: MARY COE BLEVINS -AND W. H. McNEW
W. W. Cox and George Beasley had long tenures on Dona Ana
Range.
Indeed, had they not been forced off their property
prematurely, no doubt they or their descendants would still be

RANCHING ON THE FLATS

149

ranching there.
The reason for their viability is obvious.
They
had chosen the best range land, and they had a dependable supply
of good water.
Despite occasion~l droughts, they succeeded at
ranching because they had springs and wells that could see them
through times of crisis.
Their neighbors on the flats to the east were not so
fortunate.
When Albert and Mary Coe, who ranched from Coe Lake
to Hitt's near the Texas line, dug a well--often to great depths-they never knew if the water they struck would be usable.
And
W. H. McNew, whose headquarters was north of Orogrande and whose
range paralleled the Coes' on the east, couldn't have made a go
of it at all if Oliver Lee hadn't sold him a tap on the Orogrande
Pipeline.
Ranching on the flats, then, was more tenuous, less
secure, than ranching in and near the Organs.
Concentrated livestock raising on the eastern portion of
D.ona Ana began almost thirty-five years after Shedd's initial
settlement at San Augustine Springs, when Albert and Mary Coe
homesteaded near a wet-weather lake east af Soledad Canyon.
They
bought approximately forty acres from the original patentees,
Edward B. and Lilo M. Perrin, and used it as the nucleus of a
ranch that eventually spread more than ten miles south (Fig. 22,
#15)(Do~a Ana Co~nty, Deed Record 23: 198-199).
If any two people could have succeeded at ranching in the
dry sand dunes of Dona Ana Range it would have been Mary and
Albert Coe.
Products of ranching families, the Coes had themselves been cattle raisers for twenty years before coming to the
western basin.
In fact, life in the sandy desert may have seemed
relatively uncomplicated to the Coes after their early experiences
in Lincoln County.
Albert was a member of the famous Coe family
of the Lincoln County War, and although he was described by his
relative, Wilbur, as being "the steady and quiet one " (Coe
1968: 8) he must have felt repercussions from the upheavals
occurring all around him.
Coe was born on January 28, 1844, in Virginia.
He moved
west with his parents from West Virginia to a farm near Queen
City, Missouri.
In 1871, he rode off with a brother to Independence, where he signed on with a wagon train hauling freight to
New Mexico.
Soon, he had launched a freight outfit which
served Forts Union and Stanton (Coe 1968: 5, 8).
He probably
became acquainted with the Sacramento Mountains during this
period, and eventually decided to settle there, buying a ranch and
going into stockraising on a full-time basis.
When rustling became a problem about 1878, Albert Coe
decided to head for the San Juan Country where he could wait for
things to settle down in Lincoln County (Coe 1968: 48).
He was
joined there by relatives who had become embroiled in the Lincoln
County War as partisans of Mcsween and Chisum, and for a time they
all engaged in ranching near Farmington (Rasch 1965: 215-216).
By 1880, Al was dividing his attention between Farmington
and Lincoln County (U.S. Bureau of Census 1880: Lincoln County).

150

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

The following year, he made a trip back to Missouri, where he
married Mary Mahill in Schuyler County on May 29, 1881.
With
several members of their two families, the newly-weds made the
long trip to Farmington by emigrant train, narrow-gauge railroad,
and wagon, and stayed there until late summer.
At that point,
they decided to return to the Penasco.
They arrived in the mount~ins on September 16, 1881 (Cotner, various).
One year later, the Coes were joined by Mary's parents,
who established a small community.
Albert continued to ranch,
his brothers moved back to the Sacramento Mountains, and Mary ran
the Mayhill post office (Cotner, various; Rio GPande RepubZiaan
April 9, 1887: 2).
They acquired more property, including 160
acres north of town in 1891, and 160 acres southwest in 1895
(Lincoln County, Patent Record D: 315; Otero County, Deed Record
3 2 : 12) .
- - - - ----------- -- - -- ------- ------- ----------- fn 1900, the Co es sold some of their Sacramento Mountain land
(Otero County, Deed Record 6: 251), and by the following year had
moved to Dona Ana County.
They didn't prove up on a claim
immediately, but a 1901 assessment roll indicates that they had
made $200 worth of improvements to a piece of unidentified
property (Dona Ana County, County Assessor: 1901).
They purchased the Coe Lake site two years later from Edward
B. and Lilo M. Perrin, who had patented it early in 1903, but
never lived on it (Dona Ana Coun~y, Deed Record 23: 196-199).
Located on the west side of Coe lake, the land was probably
purchased by the Coes because the lake was occasionally filled
with water, and the sand hills nearby provided fairly good
forage for their cattle.
They drilled a 130-foot-deep well that
used a two-and-one-half horsepower engine in a sheet iron
engine house.
The site eventually became a well-known water
source, although many ranchers continued to stop at Coe Lake
itself.
On at least one occasion, W. N. Fleck watered his cattle
there as he trailed them from his ranch near Orogrande to the Rio
Grande and west to Deming (Arnold 1977). 32
The Coes acquired land quickly after 1903.
Mary bought
forty acres on the south end of Cheese (now Stewart) Lak~ in
1905, and 160 acres east of the future site of Dona Ana Range
Camp in 1906.
The latter piece of property eventually became
known as the Home Ranch (Dona Ana County, Deed Record 39: 566;
Deed Record 29: 611-612).
Two years later, they also owned
eighty acres southwest of the Home Ranch (Dona Ana County, County
Assessor: 1908).
·
Approximately one-half of their ranch land was personally
owned by Mary Coe.
She made her own agreements, and all legal

Meinzer and HBre reported in 1915 (252) that the well at the
North Coe Ranch was 180 feet deep with a water level 142 feet

and analysis of the Coe property.

RANCHING ON THE FLATS

documents tend to confirm one daughter-in-law's opinion of her as
"capable" (Coe 1977).
In 1908, she made an arrangement with
George Blevins to put 200 "she stock cattlev and a herd of range
mares out on shares with him.
She agreed to provide the livestock
(located on the Coe range east of Earlham, New Mexico), bulls,
range, and water; Blevins would receive a part of the herd
increase by providing care, branding etc. (Dona Ana County,
Miscellaneous Record 1: 234).
It seems in keeping with her
personality, then, that she continued to run the ranch after
Albert Coe died on May 16, 1912, in Anthony (EZ Paso Herald May
17, 1912: 6).
On August 6, 1913, Mary married George Blevins, a rancher who
had worked for the Coes as a foreman. 33
According to a former
employee, Jim Arnold, who worked for the Blevinses after World
War I, they raised cattle.
But they also kept hundreds of
horses.
Both George and his brother, Bill, who ran sheep in
Boulder (then Bell) Canyon and around Cheese Lake, were excellent
horsemen, and at times they had over 800 head (Arnold 1977).
Simultaneously, Mary Coe Blevins rapidly expanded the ranch
by buying up small parcels of land near established water sources.
Since the government had forced her to give up her land in T24S,
R4E and T25S, R4E in 1911, she had to concentrate on acquiring
land between the Home Ranch and Coe Lake.
In 1922, she bought
160 acres about one-half mile southwest of Scott Tank (Fig. 22,
#27} and she purchased forty acres of land that included the
Dripping Springs Ranch in northern Boulder Canyon from the Bell
family (Fig. 22, 116} (Do"i'i'.a Ana County, Deed Record 64: 142-143;
Deed Record 65: 367).

Much speculation has surrounded the identity of Mary Coe's
second husband.
Sonnichsen and Stoes thought that he might
have been E. D. or John Blevins, and suggested that he was
either involved in the Fountain murder of 1896; came up from
Toyah, Texas, to summon Lee for a civil suit in Texas just
before the murder; or was a member of the infamous Arizona
Blevans family (Raley 1954; Stoes 1947; Stoes 1954).
None
of these stories rings true, however, not only because the
suggested names are incorrect, but also because George
Blevins would have been only sixteen years old in 1896.
Interestingly enough, he was born in the same county as the
Altmans and Lees came from - Taylor - but he may never have
known them since they left the area when he was only four.
Blevins was born March 7, 1880, in Shep, Texas.
His parents
were F. M. Blevins from Kentucky and Sarah Blevins from Tennessee (U.S. Bureau of Census 1880: Taylor County, Texas;
Texas Bureau of Vital Statistics 1977).
A piece of graffiti
on a water tank originally located at the Coe Lake property
indicates that Blevins worked for the Coes as early as 1907
(Davis 1973b: 11).

property north of Coe Lake (Fig. 22, #21; Fig. Sa).
A site that
had been improved by a w~ll, an adobe house, and numerous outbuildings, the Goodin land was assigned to Frank Goodin in 1915,
when he applied for state land purchase contract No. 10397.
Goodin,
who was born in Wheeler County, Texas, on January 4, 1883, and
moved to the Sacramento Mountains with his parents who were in
partnership with John W. Poe, lived at the Coe Lake site and
built a square, four-room adobe house shortly after his marriage
on June 6, 1906.
Someti~e between 1915 and 1923, he assigned his
application to W. W. Cox, who assigned it to Charles B. Vesper,
a ranching partner of Mary Blevins.
When Vesper died on
January 6, 1924, Walter C. Mossman sold ~he application_ to Mary
Blevins.
Although she did not exercise her right to purchase
until 1946, she and George Blevins undoubtedly made heavy use of
the well after the 1920's, particularly since it had the best
water in the area (Lantz 1978; Dona Ana County, [Probate File] No.
404; Miscellaneous [Record] 6: 662; Deed Record 113: 56; Probate
Court Docket 1: 412; Las Cruces DaiZy Times January 13, 1939:
2; Arno 1 d 19 7 7) . 3 4
Even in the 1940's, surrounded by cavalry units and rumors
of condemnation, Mary Blevins continued to buy land.
She
presented state lands around Coe Lake, at Scott Tank (Fig. 22.
#2 9) and in an aJ;"ea· be tween the A~ E~ Pet tit Ranch and Wes sly [sic J
Well (Fig. ·22, #30) (Do~a Ana County, Deed Record 102: 570).
She then either used them herself, or leased them all to other
ranchers, such as W. A. Abernathy of Las Cruces, who signed a
ten-year lease beginning January 1, 1944, and covering all lands
controlled by Blevins in T23S, R5E; T24S, R5E; and T25S, RSE
(Anonymous, n.d.: Vol. II, App. 48).
The ranch that began in 1901, then, had taken almost fortyfive years to accumulate.
It ran from the extreme southern
boundary of Dona Ana Range to Goodin Well twelve miles straight
north, and from Boulder Canyon on the west to an undetermined
area east of Coe Lake--probably, as W. H. McNew, Jr., was to say
of his own spread, as far as the cattle could walk and still be
near water.
Headquarters was just a short distance east of the Do~a Ana
Range Camp, and was comprised of a wooden ranch house and
innumerable outbuildings, tanks, and fences {Fig. 23).
There,
the Blevinses had a soft-water well about 350 feet deep with a
water level 328 feet below the surface (Meinzer and Hare 1915:
252).
The next major watering spot was Scott Tank, where Jim
Arnold and George Blevins frequently went to break horses.
The
well there was about 300 feet deep; adjacent to it was an adobe
pump house.
Four or five big pens completed the set-up (Arnold
1977).

See Davis (1973a) for a survey of the Goodin site.

RANCHING ON THE FLATS

Since all the range was open, cattle frequently got mixed up
together.
Sometimes Fleck's cattle drifted through, as did
Cox's, Mossman's and those of Frank Sykes who leased the Goodin
Place from the Blevinses.
Occasionally, Blevins' cattle even
drifted down to the bosques on the Rio Grande (Arnold 1977), and
so at least once a year families would get together, perhaps at
the Pettit Place (Fig. 22, #31) (Beasley 1976), and each rancher
would send an outside man to identify calves and help with the
branding.
Like everyone else, Mary Coe Blevins was hard-hit by the
condemnation proceedings that slowly ate away at her ranch.
Her
spirit remained indomitable, however, and despite the fact that
sh£ was in her late eighties at the time, an apocryphal story
circulated among her neighbors that she had chased off one Army
representative with a broom.
She died in Anthony on December 22,
1953, at ninety-one years of age; George Blevins died four months
later (The EZ Paso Times December 23, 1953: 31; El Paso County,
No. 12984 Probate: Receipt for Distributive Share; ibid.:
Order Probating Will).
The last big rancher on the flats of Dona Ana, and Mary
Blevins' neighbor to the east, was W. H. McNew.
Like Blevins,
McNew had come relatively late to Dona Ana.
In fact, it wasn't
until 1909 that he had managed to make the deal with Oliver Lee,
arranging for a tap on the Sacramento River Pipeline that would
allow him to develop his ranch headquarters just north of
Orogrande.
McNew's dependence on Oliver Lee for his ranch's lifeblood-water--was symbolic of the close relationship that existed between
the two men for over forty years.
Related by marriage, profession,
and geography, and in common defense against those people they
perceived as potential threats to their livelihood, McNew and Lee
were as inseparable as two such independent Tularosa cowmen could
ever be.
McNew's family was one of the thousands who left the
southern states after the Civil War in search of the main chance.
They were from Arkansas, where W. H. McNew was born in 1866.
They moved first to San Saba, and then to the future location of
Claude ro ft where Eli ("Pappy") Mc New homesteaded.
Soon, W. H.
met and married Nettie Fry, a member of the Lee clan, and so the
main characters in twenty years of confused and troubled times-Perry Altman, Oliver Lee, W. H. McNew, and Charley Graham--all
became related to one another by marriage or birth.
Altman and
Le e were ha 1 f b r o the rs who grew up with Ne t t i e Fry , W. H . _~Mc New ~ s
wife.
Charley Graham was married to Nettie Fry McNew's aunt,
Emma Altman Graham.
These were all close and clannish relationships which were taken seriously, and to which strangers were
rarely, if ever, admitted (McNew 1977). 35

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

According to W. H. McNew, Jr., his father's relationship with
the other three men came to something of a turning point when
they came to New Mexico, and then set out to find their own ranges.
In an alternate version of the legendary Altman-Lee story, McNew
tapped Graham on the shoulder as they were preparing to split up,
and said, "Well, Charley, we'll go out and see which one of us
can find the sorriest damn piece of property .
." Altman
located on Crow Flats, Lee around the Sacramentos, Graham at
Cutter, and McNew at Carrizozo.
Later, McNew would say that he
hadn't decided which one of them had made the worst deal.
Soon after the McNews settled at Carrizozo, sheepraisers
arrived, and so the family set out again to find a place "sorry
enough that sheep men never would move in'' (McNew 1977).
In
1888, they lived near La Luz (Do~a Ana County, County Assessor:
1888).
Soon after, they threw in with Lee, purchasing cattle
from him (Otero County, Deed Record 12: 57-59), and then aiding
him in his quasi-legal takeover of Mesa Horse Camp on Otero Mesa
from Charles Hilton in 1892 (Lincoln County, District Court,
Civil Cases: #848).
In September 1896, McNew purchased approximately 320 acres on the Sacramento River southeast of Hilton's
from the Chatfield family (Otero County, Deed Record No. 1: 249250), land which he and Nettie later quitclaimed to their children, Oliver, Myrtle, and Ele in 1898 (Dona Ana County, Deed
Record 20: 295-297).
Much of the time prior to 1900 the McNews lived in Alamogordo.
They lived briefly in El Paso in 1899 (Stoes 1947: 16).
They
even patented 160 acres in section 26 of Tl9S, Rl2E, but sold it,
along with an undivided one-half interest in a water right from
the McNew Ditch (taken from the Lee and Cox Ditch) to J. B.
Wright (Otero County, Patent Record 7: 124; Deed Record 5: 61).
After the turn of the century, McNew acquired a series of
ranches between Orogrande and White Sands.
He bought the Hunter
Place which included Pellman Well and Point of Sands.
About the
same time, he bought the old McMurray Place on the west side of
Highway 54 towards Alamogordo.
In June 1909, McNew closed the deal with Oliver Lee that made
it possible for him to ranch in the vicinity of Orogrande (Fig.
22, f/19).
For $4,000 he bought "the right to take and use 15,000
gallons, daily," of the 50,000 gallons Lee had reserved in a
warranty deed with the South West Smelting and Refining Company.
The 15,000 gallons could be taken from one of Lee's pipes then
tapping the smelter pipeline on the west side of the railroad
track north of Turquoise.
The water could not be used east of
the railroad--on Lee's range--or given to livestock pasturing east.
Lee agreed that no other part of his 50,000 gallons would be
used to water livestock belonging or pasturing west of the railroad (Otero County, Deed Record No. 32: 598-599).
In this manner,
each man protected his respective range.
Between 1915 and 1917, McNew made a series of sales that
further enabled him to give his undivided attention to the

----------

RANCHING ON THE FLATS

Orogrande property.
He quitclaimed to James A. and Walter Baird
of the San Andres Mountain area the Pellman Ranch about two-andone-half miles south of the southern end of White SAnds, the
Wait Ranch about two miles west of the Pellman Ranch, Dewey Ranch
about one-and-one-half miles north of the southern end of White
Sands, and the White Water Ranch about five miles northeast of
Pellman by wagon road.
He also disposed of the Hunter ranches,
. which consist of the Well and
Improvements at the point of the White
Sands, the Well and Improvements known as
Pellman Ranch, the Pendergrass Well and
Improvements, the Dewey Place, and the
Antelope Place (Otero County, Quit Claim
Deed Record No. 27: 304; ibid., No. 37:
2 6 6) .

By the end of World War I, the McNew family had settled
permanently at their Orogrande Ranch.
There were five boys and
one girl: Oliver, Ele, Robert, W. H. Jr., peorge~ and Myrtle.
They lived in a boarding house that had replaced an earlier
lumber shack, and was originally located at Monte Carlo Gap.
McNew bought the two-story building and moved it in on wagons with
teams.
The downstairs was one big room where everyone ate;
upstairs were seven rooms where the family bunked.
Later, a son,
:Robert, took the second story off after he - and Bill, Jr., got the
ranch.
With five boys in the family, McNew rarely had to hire help.
Extra hands, when they were needed, were usually local boys who
worked on one ranch and then another.
The area they were
expected to cover sometimes went as far south as the state line
and the Newman Ranch, although their official range boundary lay
between Elwood and Desert.
In fact, the headquarters was just a
little north of the center of the ranch, and after the Taylor
Grazing Act, the McNews were allotted almost 300 sections.
As on every other ranch, McNew's range ~antral reached as
far as his cattle could go and still get water.
In an effort to
extend that range, the family eventually installed approximately
twenty miles of pipeline which left the home ranch, ran northwest
through Monte Carlo Gap, and dropped down the west ~ide of the
Jarillas.
At the foot of the western slope, the pipe branched,
one line going south eight miles.
The main line went to the West
Camp about four miles west of Monte Carlo Gap, a little north
of Hal Cox's Steampump.
There, the line branched again and went
another five miles north to the North Camp.
On Dona Ana Range, the McNews owned South Tank (Fig. 22)
which they relied on rain to fill up.
Later, they obtained a
water right at the reservoir outside of Orogrande, and pumped the
water down to the tank.
After the line was abandoned, the McGregors
and W. H. McNew, Jr., used the area as a summer range, placing
stock there during rainy months.

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

Attempts to install wells on the western side of the Jarillas
failed when the McNews reached 300 feet and only got water so
mineralized that it wasn't usable.
Water resources, then,
consisted of eight tanks--seven fresno-built, and one metal.
All
were fed, at one time or another, by water from the Sacramento
River Pipeline.
The pipeline gave the McNews an advantage that none of their
neighbors had.
Even so, they occasionally experienced other
problems, such as a lack of feed.
They figured about seven head
per section, and with time would build up a good herd.
Then a
drought would hit, 11 •
•
and dispose of them for us."
They
would have to sell off the bulk of the ~attle, keeping just the
core of a herd--perhaps 200 to 300 mother cows.
During the 1930's,
however, with the introduction of cottonseed cake, the cattle had
a better chance.
The calf crop increased dramatically, and the
cake was a readily-available supplement to the regular browse.
The McNews only had to drive their cattle two miles at sale
time.
They generally took them to a railhead at Turquoise where
there was a section foreman's house and a string of houses for
the hands.
After 1922, control of the McNew Ranch gradually passed to
two sons, Robert and W. H. Jr., _wi.th Robert_purch~u~iin_g the 15,0QO
gallon-per-day water rights, and later, in 1926, patenting the 617.42 acres that surrounded the h-0me ranch (Otero County, Deed
Record 78: .485; Patent Record 58: 286).
The two men had a score
of years, following their father's death on June 30, 1937, of
a cerebral hemorrhage, during which they could exercise complete
and uncontested control of their ranch (Otero County, Index to
Births and Deaths 1: n.p.).
After that, they not only had to sell
their grazing allotments in ten townships (Otero County, Miscellaneous Record 136: 559-561), but they were constantly harassed by
the government to sell or otherwise relinquish their water
rights so that a post could be maintained at Camp Orogrande.
Finally, their ranch whittled down to a fraction of its original
size, the McNew brothers sold the balance to John and Prebble
Atkins on July 24, 1964 (Otero County, Deed Record 317: 423), who
ran the ranch until they sold it to B. B. Johnson, the current
owner.
With the Cox Ranch at San Augustine, the McNew Ranch at
Orogrande was all that remained of an industry which had once
controlled the southern Tularosa Basin.

159

MILITARY ACTIVITY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
The aggressive return of the military to Dona Ana Range
in the twentieth century came as a shock to most ranchers, who
had settled in th£ Tularosa long after the last of the troops
had disappeared.
None of thnse who experienced severe pressure
to sell their land after 1940 realized that, in fact, there had
been only thirty-one years--from 1880 to 1911--out of the past
100 when the military had not used the Tularosa for one purpose
or another.
Perhaps the antagonism which arose between the two groups
grew out of the type of military use during the twentieth
century, for where once the army had been protector of the basin's
inhabitants, now it appeared determined to destroy the basis of
the cattle industry by withdrawing all land and water resources
necessary to it. Unaware of the earlier service the military had
performed, and confronted only by the likelihood of extinction,
ranchers reacted to what they perceived as one more in a series
of threats to the ranching way of life.
Acquisition of Dona Ana Range by the military began on
December 29, 1911, when Executive Order No. 1450 set aside for
military purposes all public lands in Townships 24 and 25 South,
Range 4 East (Anonymous, n.d.: Vol. I, 113).
This order was
followed by other acquisitions of patents, some by condemnation,
until all land in the two townships was controlled by the Army.
Condemned lands ran from Boulder Canyon on the north to the
present southern boundary of the Range, and from the present
western boundary to the eastern side of War Highway 11.
Land
owners affected by the acquisition of this core area were Mary
Coe Blevins, the heirs of Mayer Halff, and the Bell family.
Also affected were the Findlays, who had 160 acres at the mouth
of Finley Canyon (Dona Ana County, Deed Record 43: 161), where
they lived briefly before moving to Rincon and then to Hatch. 36
Dona Ana Range was acquired by the army for use by troops
from Fort Bliss who were undergoing field training, and by
artillery troops testing new equipment.
The area was chosen
because a large percentage of it was public domain.
Thus, to
the Army's way of thinking, the range was ideal because: 1) it

3 6

John Francis Findlay who owned the Do~a Ana property is
probably the same individual as John F. Findlay featured in a
lengthy article which appeared in the El Paso Herald Post of
November 13, 1961.
According to the Herald Post, Findlay was
born in Colombo, Ceylon, and came to Las Cruces in 1900 to
check on an investment in the Elephant Butte Dam.
After he
lost money on the proposition, he went to Mexico to represent
a mining company, and then returned to the Organs where he
operated a horse ranch in 1905.
His home in 1961 was on an
island off th£ west coast of Florida.

160

THE HISTORIC RESOURCE

provided sufficient space to carry out necessary field and artillery maneuvers, and 2) the area was sparsely populated and so the
expense required to a~quire the property would be almost nil in
comparison to privately-owned and densely-populated areas elsewhere (Anonymous, n.d.: Vol. I, 19).
By 1912, the El Paso Herald announced that artillery units
were ready to use the range, and that the Second Cavalry would
be going out in small squads (October 4, 1912: 6).
Battery units
the following summer included Battery B, Sixth Field Artillery
(El Paso Herald June 18, 1913: 4).
During their early use of Dona Ana, the military altered
certain parts of the Range.
Dona Ana Range Camp was constructed
as an austere bivouac area for troops undergoing field training,
and the primitive accomodations consisted of flimsy screened
structures.
A caretaker named Sergeant Dana stayed at the camp
at all times.
Jim Arnold, who worked for Mary Coe Blevins in
the 1920's, recalled that Dana ran the camp almost as if it were
a small ranch, keeping a garden and a few head of stock (Arnold
1977).
Another alteration to the Dona Ana landscape occurred
when the army built a small railroad on the northwest portion
of the Franklin Mountains (F£g.24d) which was used for hauling
guns and equipment up the slope.
Once at the top, troops would
fire towards the Organs and Boulder Canyon (Beasley 1977b).
Charley Webber was a member of the cavalry after World War
I, and was stationed at Fort Bliss.
He remembers that after
the war, Do~a Ana Range was used by the Seventh and Eighth
cavalry units once a year for a month at a time.
In order to get
to Dona Ana Range camp from Fort Bliss, the units travelled
through Threadgill's Ranch, located near Newman.
Wagons, each
pulled by four mules, brought supplies to the camp on a regular
basis.
Once on Dona Ana, the cavalry lived in tents.
They were
expected to gain proficiency at running three different courses:
the mounted pistol course for which there were fourteen targets,
the rifle range, and the saber course, a timed event.
At any
given point, cavalry members had about 1,000 horses at their
disposal for practice (Webber 1977).
At one time, in the late 1920's, the Seventh and Eighth
cavalry maneuvered with the Ninth and Tenth cavalry (colored)
from Fort Huachuca, Arizona.
In forays reminiscent of those
staged half-a-century earlier, the troops ranged as far north as
San Augustine Pass and the Jornada.
Another time, Webber's
group made a ride from Ruidoso to Fort Bliss, a trip of over 100
miles (Webber 1977).
Acquisition of the core area of Dona Ana Range was relatively
simple, and for twenty-five years, events on the range were quiet.
In 1946, however, the proverbial shoe fell when the army decided
to block up all of present-day Dona Ana Range and White Sands.
Scientists were developing ever larger firing apparatus, requiring
more and more space for testing, and it was felt that the range
must expand proportionately.

MILITARY ACTIVITY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

161

As with earlier acquisitions, the government reasoned that
it would be better to take land in the Tularosa Basin because the
ratio of population to acreage was so small.
And, indeed, only
ten percent of the total land mass was deeded, while fifteen
percent was state-owned, and seventy-five percent was federal, or
public domain, administered under the Taylor Grazing Act (Cobb
1977).
On the other hand, the military's assessment of the
situation during the 1940's hardly did credit to the unique
relationship that had developed between the Tularosa ranchers and
their land.
Their frequent jokes about the "sorriness" of their
property belied a deep attachment to it, and now, to their despair,
they found that the ratio between deeded and leased land that had
worked to their advantage in the past, now worked against them
as the military easily succeeded in having state and federal
lands withdrawn. 37
The first pieces of property to be purchased were those
belonging to Mary Coe Blevins, th~ Beasley family, and the Coxes.
W. H. McNew, Jr., through a series of legal technicalities, was
able to hold out longer.
He had a valuable commodity in his
Sacramento River water rights, and when the Army was faced with
the necessity or--pr-oviding water for troops at Orogrande Camp,
it had to go to McNew.
Negotiations were initiated in early 1943
by McNew, who was interested in turning a profit by leasing his
rights to the government.
Later the same year, he offered to sell
the rights and move from the Orogrande Ranch if the government
would relocate him on another ranch of equal carrying capacity.
The government refused to take McNew's offer, or to suggest
a viable alternative, and so it leased the portion of McNew's
ranching allotment which contained the water rights.
Eventually,
the strained relations between government and rancher came to a
head over the issue of the pipe which was required to carry water
to Orogrande Camp, the government insisting at the conclusion of
the lease in November 1947 that they had replaced McNew's old
pipe with new, and now wanted to replace it once again with used
pipe.
So much time was spent arguing about the issue that the
government began to take on the hue of the ranchers it was dealing with, as it endlessly debated the pros and cons of water
acquisition and dispersal (Anonymous n.d.: Vol. I, 10-11, 47-50,
56-57).
By the 1950's, the military was fully aware of the importance
of water to their hold on Do~a Ana.
They also realized that only
by demolishing or selling off the ranchers' former residences
could they fully assure that further attempts would not be made
to reclaim the range lands.
In one directive, they destroyed
most of the vestiges of historic occupation on Do~a Ana by order-

Miners were also hard-hit, as over a dozen patented mining
claims were rendered invalid.

buildings moved or bulldozed.
An attempt was even made to destroy
Soledad Spring, but the engineering department finally concluded
that the spring would be impossible to stop because it originated
so far inside the Organs (Fort Bliss, Texas, n.d.b).
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
If few remains of historical occupation exist on McGregor
Range, even fewer exist on Do~a Ana.
In fact, it would not be
far from the truth to conclude that, within the area open to
survey, Dona Ana is close to being a complete loss insofar as
three-dimensional historic st~uctures are concerned.
Heavy tank
activity has completed the initial destruction carried out by
the engineering division, and the unavailability of the Cobb files

It is possible, however, that there may be sufficient
arch~ological evidence remaining to warrant a careful comparison
of ranching sites on Do~a Ana and McGregor ranges.
By using a
combination of low-level aerial photography, detailed ground
recording, and limited surface collecting--such as that being done
by David M. Jones at the University of London (Southwestern
Mission Research Center 1977: 2-3; Jones 1977a; 1977b)--it may be
possible to establish the layout of several of the ranches in the
basin area.
The Coe and Goodin ranches at Coe Lake and Scott
Tank, and near Do~a Ana Range Camp (Fig. 23), would especially
lend themselves to this treatment and some work of a similar type
has been initiated by a group of individuals working through the
Centennial Museum: Leslie Davis, Jack Hedrick, T. Martin, and
Herbert C. Morrow.
Results from testing, combined with similar
results from McGregor, and compared with information available
through such institutions as the Ranching Heritage Center at
Texas Tech University, Lubbock, may offer interesting insights
concerning changes in ranching traditions as they were carried
into a new, arid, southwestern environment.

The Cobb files were assembled in the 1940's while Do~a Ana
lands were being acquired.
Information in the files included
maps of each rancher's holdings and improvements, locations
and descriptions of wells, and descriptions and photographs
of houses, mines, tanks, and other property.
The files have
only recently been rediscovered by Glen DeGarmo, Fort Bliss
archeologist.

AFTERWARD
The pattern of research and recording for Dona Ana Artillery
Range closely followed that established during the study of
McGregor Missile Range in 1975.
Research wa~ done primarily in
New Mexico and involved a combination of personal interviews;
work with archival resources in the Rio Grande Historical
Collections (Las Cruces), the State Record_ C!aI1te_r and Archives
and the State Library (Santa Fe), the Archives at the University
of Texas at El Paso, and the Southwestern Room at the El Paso
Public Library; and a survey of legal records in the Santa Fe
offices of the Bureau of Land Managemen~, and various county
courthouses--Do~a Ana, Lincoln, El Paso, and Otero.
The richest
fields were found to be the Dona Ana Courthouse, county clerk's
office, and the Rio Grande Historical Collections where, thanks
to the efforts of Austin Hoover, director, and Herman Weisner,
historian, family papers, photographs, and tapes revealed bits
and pieces of the history of Dona Ana Range.
Recording started in the summer of 1976, and continued in
the spring of 1977.
Since there were few standing structures
left within the area open to survey, "recording" implied either
photographing what remained, or measuring foundations, or both.
Standardized data sheets were completed, some of which included
measured drawings accomplished by two individuals using steel
tapes and recording on site forms.
As on McGregor, the survey of Dona Ana Range has served to
highlight work that remains to be done.
There are a number of
ranchers who should be interviewed, and some of those whose
reminiscences have been recorded once--such as W. H. McNew, Jr.-should be interviewed again as further research suggests questions
that only former occupants can answer.
Archives that could not
be examined--such as the J. Evetts Haley Collection (Midland,
Texas), the Maurice Garland Fulton Collection (Tucson, Arizona),
the western history collection at the University of Oklahoma,
and the National Archives--should be visited.
In addition, there
are several fine private collections of valuable information
about weather patterns in the southern Tularosa, such as the
daybooks of Hal and Jim Cox, and Charley Graham, that need to be
examined.
Finally, low-altitude photographs should be made of selected
sites, and the information extracted f~crm them concerning ranch
layouts, the relative positions of structures, fencing patterns,
and the siting of buildings relative to topography, compared to
information available from similar sites in the states of family
origin.
The almost complete destruction of historic buildings on
Dona Ana Artillery Range need not imply the total loss of cultural
data, but it is imperative that steps be taken soon to recover
what information is available before the sites are further
disturbed.

ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Duford W. Skelton and David S. Dibble

183

ASSESSMENT OF THE DISCOVERED CULTURAL RESOURCES
PREHISTORIC RESOURCES
The evaluations of the prehistoric cultural resources are
limited in scope~ primarily due to the nature of the investigations.
The research value of many of the sites could not be
adequately assessed solely from surficial inspections.
In
addition, the areal extent of our reconnaissance was restricted.
Recommendations concerning specific properties or groups of
properties are related to estimates of their "potential" for
producing reliable data which may contripute to current understanding of the regional cultural systems.
The study has not
resulted in specific recommendations for nomination of
individual sites or districts to the National Register of
Historic Places, although the assessments have strongly
suggested that many of the occupations are of sufficient
scientific and historical value to warrant National Register
status.
Such an evaluation should occur after investigation of
a larger sample of the Army properties and, in many cases, after
more intensive investigations of those sites discovered in the
course of this work.
In our opinion, and in keeping with
current conservation philosophy, the properties described herein
must be viewed in terms of their known or suspected value for
contributing to the regional knowledge of history or prehistory.
However, recommendations directed toward the conservation, or further investigation, of known sites will be offered
(see also Appendix III, Site Descriptions).
It should be clearly understood that all cultural resources
have the potential to yield some useful information.
Even the
most severely disrupted sites, for example, may provide information on settlement patterns, local technology, or even trade
relationships and site function.
However, with the vast
majority of arch~ological sites documented on Dofia Ana Range,
this potential value would be quickly exhausted by a systematic
sampling of surface-e::xposed material.
Thus, the following
discussions are presented as a tentative assessment of research
value.
The intensive survey, covering 10 percent of the accessible
lands on Dona Ana Range or an area of 96 km. 2 , resulted in the
documentation of 198 prehistoric sites.
These remains varied
from small isolated scatters of chipping debitage, presumably
representing stone tool manufacturing loci, to large Village
Complex sites with substantial quantities of cultural residues
reflecting a variety of activities which occurred at the sites.
The social systems and cultural processes that resulted in this
record were diverse; there is archeological evidence indicating
both continuity and change in technology and subsistence. When
viewed as a whole, the cultural resources of Dona Ana are
potentially important as a source of information on a wide

184

ASSESSMENT

variety of contemporary research interests, including cultural
change and human adaptation within the Tularosa Valley.
The present condition of the prehistoric sites on Dona
Ana is generally poor. Many of the sites have been totally displaced from their original stratigraphic contexts, limiting
their potential for further investigation.
Recommendations
concerning individual sites are given in Appendix III, and are
based partially on their present condition and apparent ability
to contribute reliable information.
The assessed potential of
a site w-as strongly affected oy: 1) the degree of structural
integrity of a site as de1Ilonstrated or inferred from general
surface observations; 2) the presence of visible structural
features such as rock hearths wh~ch exhibit partial physical
integrity and 3) a judgment of our ability to effectively
evaluate internal site structure and depositional context from
surface observations.
These criteria are especially important when attempting to
assess th_e resource value of a limited sample, the analysis of
which is essentially descriptive in content.
The present study
was designed to identify, inventory, and describe the archeological resources which are being affected by military
activities on the Range.
The investigations were snrficial
examinations, lacking the subsurface testing necessary to
develop a reliable statement of significance.
As stated,
the archeological investigations did not produce the kind of
data necessary to recommend sites to the National Register on
the basis of regional resource value.
However, certain general
statements can be made concerning the archeological resources
and the research potential.
Analyses of (observed and collected) ceramics form a
significant portion of our study.
Statements on the potential
of this resource for future site-specific and regional studies
are made by Smiley in Appendix II.
OLD COE LAKE DISTRICT
Data gathered during thBse investigations indicate that
many of th~ sites which retain much of their original
depositional context are concentrated near Old Coe Lake basin
and in adjacent parts of the desert lowlands and alluvial fans.
This area, referred to here as the "Old Coe Lake District",
extends approximately 6 km. north, east, and south and about 2.5
km. west of Old Coe Lake basin.
Investigations of the district included intensive coverage
of fifteen sample quadrats in which forty-one prehistoric sites
were documented.
An additional ten sites were discovered during
the preliminary reconnaisanee
carried out by the Texas
Archeological Survey, and during investigations by -me-mbers of
the El Paso Archeological Society.
All prehistoric sites
recorded in th~ Old Coe Lake district are presented in Tables 15
and 16.

ASSESSMENT

The most important elements in assessing the value of
known archeological resources w~thin the Old Coe Lake area are:
1) depositional context; 2) variability of represented site
types; and 3) density of Village Complex sites.
Depositional
context refers to demonstrable or inferred structural integrity.
Documented archeological localities within the Old Coe Lake
area display thE h~ghest degree of structural integrity
recognized during these investigations.
Information gathered
from extens-ive s-urf icial examinations of arroyo cutoanks
and vandal's poth~les, as well as artifact distributions,
suggest that many of the sites in this section of the Range
retain much of their original depositibnal context.
These sites
often exhib.it artifact concentrations which are clustered around
visible s-truc t ural f ea tu res such as rock hearths.
This was
especially evident at the larger Village Complex sites, where
there are usually artifacts associated with what appears to
be the remains of structures.
Th_e cultural resources in the Old Coe Lake area show a
h~gh degree of variability.
Virtually all site types, except
ceramic scatters, chipped stone scatters, and cave/rockshelter~ occur with some frequency in the district.
In addition
to the site types defined by this study, at least two unique
site types are known from the initial reconnaissance performed
by professional archeologists, and from information obtained
by local amateur societies and military informants who have
collected artifacts from sites in this area.
These sites are
a small "hamlet" (see Whalen 1977: 21) and a Paleoindian
locality.
The inclusion of this Early Man site, and the
possibility of historic Apache Indian sites located in this area
(see Part II} suggest that the Old Coe Lake area may contain
examples of major cultural developments which have been defined
in the Tularosa Valley region.
The variabliity of recognized site types, and the density
of archeological sites found within such a small area, are
unique on Dona Ana Range.
No otoha-t section of the Range
exhib.ited this kind of diversity, degree of intactness, and
density of archeological phenomena.
In addition to the variability of the archeological
resources, th.ere is a high degree of variation· in the environment of the Old Coe Lake area.
The two major physiographic
zones are distal alluvial fans and desert lowlands.
There are
also a series of ecotonal environments related to Old Coe Lake,
numerous· other play as, and the various major stream channels
associated with the coalesced fan and upper desert drainage
systems.
Ecological factors such as vegetation, soils, and
water are the environmental variables which determine spacing
and availability of natural resources exploited by the various
cultural groups which have occupied the area.
Although
detailed studies need to be completed to document the temporal
placement of these resources, they are of great importance in

ASSESSMENT

an understanding of cultural adaptation in the area.
Environmental factors need to be thoroughly documented and
should be integrated into any further studies within the Old Coe
Lake area as well as on Doiia Ana Range in general.
All properties identified herein as Village Complex
sites (D-69 ,° D-71, D-74, D-84, D-87, D-98, D-99, D-100, D-116,
and D-117} are located within th~ Old Coe Lake area.
In
addition, one Village Complex (D-203) was documented during the
preliminary reconnaiss·ance, and three other sites· recorded by
the El Pas-o Arcfieological Society -may fall into this category.
Thus:, all pres·en t ly known village comp lex sites are clustered
witfiin the very limited Old Coe Lake area.
Further, the vas:t
majority of th.ese s·ites: (70 percent, excluding EPAS recordings
which w·ere not included in these assessments) were determined
to have suffered only moderate disruption.
It is believed that
many of these resources remain sufficiently intact to allow
for critical interpretations of archeological data, and may
possess the necessary criteria for nomination to the National
Register.
In summary, the archeological resources identified in the
Old Coe Lake area have demonstrahle value and will enhance the
current understanding of prehistoric cultures on both a regional
and a site-specific level.
The area contains nearly all of the site types identified
during this study, as well as resources which are uniq~e and
seem to be restricted to this particular section of Dona Ana
Range.
The site density is particularly high, with at least
some evidence from each major period of prehistoric occupation
in this region.
The area is especially important for studying
sedentary adaptations.
Its diverse ecotonal environments
provide a wide range of examples which will aid in the analysis
of subsistence and resource utilization, and may contribute to
an understanding of developing Mogollon agricultural systems.
HISTORIC RESOURCES
A preliminary assessment of the historic resources of Dona
Ana Range indicates th.at sufficient representative sites remain
to warrant future s·tudy of hoth the physical resources and the
individuals· as·sociated with the history of the Range.
Two types of historic "resources" are especially deserving
of attention - informants and the sites themselves.
Furthermore, they are of almost equal value in any future study of
Dona Ana, since former residents can often locate sites and
describe components and functions which may not be readily
apparent from the study of the site alone.
Hence, the judicious
use of interviews may save a researcher vast amounts of time.
There is no point in conjecturing about the function of an
object when the maker of it may be able to provide the same, or
more accurate, information.

MILITARY IMPACT

189

However, because all informant material must be evaluated,
sites themselves must be carefully examined.
The study of a
site may reveal a great deal about the cultural and social backgrounds of the individuals associated with it, including facts
of which the occupants themselves were unaware.
The detached,
scientific exalnination of items of material culture, from the
construction of houses· to the layout of fences, tanks, wells,
and pastures, and th_e relationship of all of th.es-e items to
natural features-, may tell the s-cholar -much aoout s-uch topics
as migratory· patterns· and cb.anges tli.at settlers lnay h.ave -made
in adapting to a new environment.
ASSESSMENTS OF MILITARY IMPACTS
INTRODUCTION
Archeological investigations included an assessment of the
past and present effects of military activities and related
adverse ilnpac ts on the archeologi cal resources do cum en ted on
Doiia Ana Range.
These assessments are based on direct evidence
observed during the field research and on information obtained
from reliable military informants.
The assessments are of
considerable importance in determining the relative significance
of known archeological sites.
In review~ng these assessments
it should be emphasized that the cultural resources located
throughout the Tularosa Basin, including the present study area,
are in extremely fragile condition (see Beckes, Dibble, and
Freeman 19"_77, and Whalen 1977).
This fragility was especially
w·ell exp res s·ed on Dona Ana Range, , where most sites were on or
just below the present surface, protected, at lnost, by a thin
veneer (generally ~10 cm.) of unconsolidated, sandy sediments.
TYPES OF ORSERVED IMPACT
Analysis of data gathered during the present study
indicates that the effects of military operations conducted
on Do;a Ana Range have in the past and are currently resulting
in di.rect and indirect advers-e ilnpact to archeological sites.
These activities also severely effect other environmental
features which contribute ancillary information, such as paleoenvironmental reconstruction.
Direct Impact
Direct impacts include all military activities which result
in the immediate destruction of archeological resources.

ASSESSMENT

190

Field Training:Exercises
The greatest single source of direct impact is the ongoing, day-to-day field-training exercises currently being
conducted by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, the New Mexico
National Guard (Mates), and various other reserve units whose
use of the range is more sporadic and unpredictable.
These
field-training exercises consist of ground maneuvers involving
the passage of numerous tanks and other heavy tracked vehicles,
and wheeled vehicles, evidence of which was observed throughout
investigated areas of the range.
This impact is especially
noticeable in the desert lowlands where .most sites have been
deflated and currently lie on or just below the surface.
Tracked vehicles have criss-crossed this area, destroying
cultural remnants and features which lie in their path.
Several recent studies have conclusively demonstrated that offroad-vehicle use also results in accelerated soil erosion,
denudation and loss of plant species diversity, and reductions
in animal populations (see Vollmer et al. 1976; Webb et al. 1978).
Archeological sites in this area have been severely damaged and
in some cases entirely destroyed.
Ground maneuvers often include establishment of bivouac
areas where emplacements are excavated, along with refuse pits
for disposal of military debris, fox holes, latrines, and
barrow pits.
In some of these areas, sand dunes have been leveled and vegetation destroyed by the passage of numerous tanks,
personnel trucks, and other heavy machinery. Many of the
bivouac areas were seeded with unexploded ordnance, including
discarded small arms ammunition.
Bivouacs were most noticeable
along the distal sections of alluvial fans between War Highway
11 and Firing Ranges 100 and 101.
As previously noted, this
section of the range contains the vast majority of the known
village complex sites as well as numerous other site types
defined and labeled herein as "Large Complex Camps" and "Complex
Camps." Many of the sites located along the alluvial fans
have retained greater structural integrity than those located
in the desert lowlands.
Installations
A second source of direct impact on archeological resources
is the construction and use of various military installations.
These include range camps, towers, radar monitoring stations,
firing ranges, launching tracks, and access roads.
Such
modifications are scattered throughout the range but are somewhat concentrated along the distal alluvial fans of the Organ
and Jarilla Mountains, and in the northern section of the range
adjacent to White Sands Missile Range.
The construction of
these facilities involved large surface modfications.
Any
archeological sites which may have been present are thus
affected.

MILITARY IMPACT

191

Artillery Practice and Range Fires
Artillery practice and range fires are also potentially
detrimental to prehistoric sites.
During these investigations
several ground fires were observed along the upper slopes of
the alluvial fans at the base of the Organ Mountains.
These
fires originated as a result of aerial gunnery practice.
On
occasion the fires blazed out of control for several days, and
extended beyond the alluvial fans to include canyons within
the Organ Mountains.
Since most of the Organ Mountains area
could not be investigated, due to the extremely high frequency
of unexploded ordnance, it was not possible to document the
exact extent of damage to the archeological and ecological
resources.
But the adverse potential of this hazard is obvious.
It must be emphasized that environmental features produce
ancillary information for archeological studies, and as such are
considered as part of the archeological resource base (Scovill,
Gordon, and Anderson 1972: 3, 6).
Further, the destruction of
plant communities along the proximal sections of alluvial fans
most certainly contributes to the erosional processes, such as
rilling and arroyo cutting, which are actively destroying prehistoric sites, especially those located along the distal
alluvial fans.
Indirect Impact
Indirect impacts consist of natural and cultural
(mechanical) transformations which are adversely affecting the
archeological resources as a secondary consequence of military
activities on the range.
One such change is the greater
accessibility to remote areas, which has promoted vandalism
by both military and civilian personnel.
The major transformations are accelerated erosion of range sediments,
denudation of plant species diversity, and reduction in animal
populations.
These adverse effects would probably occur to some
degree without military ownership and use of the range.
How~
ever, there is substantial evidence that military activities,
especially the use of off road vehicles, have resulted in a
tremendous increase in indirect impacts.
Such indirect effects,
often surficial in nature, are difficult to recognize or
thoughtfully quantify, and may converge with direct impacts.
Vandalism
Vandalism represents a major source of site destruction on
Dona Ana Range.
It ranges from unauthorized relic collecting to
unsystematic digging of prehistoric sites.
The effects of
vandalism were recognized throughout the investigated quadrats.
However, it is the larger Village Complex Sites and large
Complex Camps along the distal alluvial fans in the Old Coe
Lake area that are being most severely disrupted by vandalism.

ASSESSMENT

Evidence gathered during field studies and information obtained
from reliable military informants indicates that the larger,
more complex prehistoric sites located in and around the Old
Coe Lake area are the primary focus of vandalism.
Much of
this destructive activity was observed in or near bivouacs and
is known to be associated with military personnel.
Informants also revealed that other areas were often
visited by military and civilian personnel for the sole purpose of collecting artifacts.
These areas included Soledad
Canyon, Steward Lake, Elephant Mountain, Rattlesnake Ridge,
and the Franklin Mountains.
Accelerated Erosion
Military operations, and especially field-training
exercises, adversely effect the cultural resources of Dona Ana
Range by accelerating erosion.
The association of increased
erosion with military operations is well documented throughout
the range.
Such erosion results in the loss of primary
stratigraphic associations, and often reduces archeological
sites to series of charcoal stains, highly scattered burned
rock, and pottery fragments.
The most active erosional
processes are surface deflation, sheet wash displacement,
rilling, and arroyo cutting.
Surface deflation by wind action is the most widespread of
the erosional agents.
It is considerably more active in the
desert lowlands where large military maneuvers involving
numerous heavy, tracked vehicles have loosened sediments and
reduced vegetational cover.
Arroyo cutting, rilling, and sheet wash Jisplaaement
were also observed throughout the desert, but these erosional
processes are most active along the lower slopes of alluvial
fans.
In these areas, water-generated erosion has caused
considerable disruption of cultural deposits.
The repeated
passage of heavy tracked vehicles along alluvial fans often
initiates rilling.
This channeling of runoff from the mountain
is common in bivouac areas and may become more intensive further
down slope until arroyos are formed.
The effects associated with Army activities on Dona Ana
are presented in Table 17, which indicates that approximately
85 percent of the recorded 198 prehistoric sites exhibited
significant (greater than 25 percent) horizontal and/or vertical
displacement as a direct result of these activities.
In an
additional 15 percent of these sites, the disruption has been
less severe, involving less than 25 percent of thE estimated
site area.
Investigation of the 96 square kilometers sampled
in this survey failed to record a single prehistoric site which
had not been adversely affected to some degree by Army
activities.
This section has documented, insofar as possible given the
nature of the survey and the ephemeral conditions of th_e local

RECOMMENDATIONS

19 3

environment, the source of direct adverse impact to the archeological resources on Dona Ana Range.
All 198 prehistoric
sites have been disturbed to some degree.
Sites located in the
desert lowlands are especially susceptible to destruction due
to the fragile condition of these sites lying on or near the
present surface.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The reconnaissance reported here has demonstrated that a
substantial historic and scientific resource does exist on Dona
Ana Range.
For reasons which have been ~reviously listed and
discussed at length, no specific opinions are provided at this
time as to the eligibility of individual properties for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Collectively, however, the inventoried sample is of unquestionable importance to the understanding of human adaptation in the
region.
As such, the resource should be highly valued and
subject to whatever protective measures can be reasonably
applied.
The recommendations which follow are directed toward
two aims: judicious preservation of, and further investigation
of the resource base.
Specific site-by-site recommendations
are given in Appendix III "Site Descriptions", and "An
Assessment of the Historic Resource".
An overriding recommendation is this: that the U.S. Army Fort Bliss continue to develop and implement a program for
cultural resource management to include all properties under
its jurisdiction.
In order to generate cohesive and effective
long-range plans and also to be responsive to problems demanding immediate attention, it is highly recommended that the
Army retain substantial in-house capability, including a
professional cultural resource management staff.
Efforts
currently being made in this direction by the Army are to be
commended.
The apparent incompatibility of many on-going military
training activities and the preservation of fragile and often
subtly expressed prehistoric sites on Dona Ana Range makes
it especially difficult to generate workable suggestions
directed toward resource conservation.
It is clear, however,
that unfettered continuance of current land use practices on
the Range will eventually destroy most of the existing
archeological record.
The reconnaissance has, for example,
demonstrated that off-road vehicle use in the Tularosa Valley
floor has very severely limited the research utility of sites
present there.
Even in areas of heavy surface modifications,
however, it is considered important that residual archeological
features be respected.
For example, the practice of "flattening"

194

ASSESSMENT

bivouac areas or the construction of roads without prior
archeological clearance surveys seems a needless waste of what
little remains.
Too, the possibility of finding isolates
of relatively unmodified cultural deposits in such areas was
not ruled out as a result of our sampling reconnaissance.

LATE QUATERNARY GEOMORPHIC AND PEDOLOGIC
PROCESSES ON DONA ANA RANGE

John D. Pigott
ABSTRACT
A reconnaissance survey of the geomorphology and soils of
Dona Ana Range was carried out in conjunction with the archeological sampling.
The first section of this Appendix presents
some speculations about major hydrologic changes which may have
drastically affected the prehistoric occupation of the area.
The random sampling design for the archeological survey is
described in the second section and the association of certain
site types with paleosols mapped on the Range is proposed.
The Village Complex Camps of both the Mesilla and El Paso
phases are found more often on paleargids and in closer
proximity to playa strandlines~ as would be expected
agriculturally oriented occupations.

INTRODUCTION
In order to recast the environment extant during the time
of aboriginal occupation, those indicators particularly
susceptible to change and easily identified can provide a
meaningful method of analysis.
One such environmental indicator
is soil.
By mapping and comparing paleosols to present-day
soils, one can not only delineate the changes which have occurr~d geologically and climatically, but also inventory potential
resources available during the inhabitation.
Because a large
portion of Dona Ana Range was declared "off-limits", including
the geologically interesting Organ Mountains, a pedologic
analysis was more tractable than a geologic one and thus became
a doubly useful method of physically dealing with the environment.
This appendix is composed of two parts.
One section
treats the late Quaternary geomorphic development of the
western Tularosa Valley, proposing a large paleo-drainage
which consequently affected playa development along the eastern
side of the Organ Mountains.
The second section analyzes the
paleosols and tests for particular settlement pattern
associations upon them.
Although but a reconnaissance study,
some physical and anthropological trends noted warrant
additional investigation of th~s fascinating area.

LATE QUATERNARY GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES
INTRODUCTION
The Tularosa Basin is located in south-central New Mexico
and extends as the Hueco Balson into west Texas (Figs. I-la, b).
Since the Tertiary, this graben complex has infilled with a
thick sequence of alternating alluvial-lacustrine sediments.
This paper concerns geologic processes which have affected
the accumulation of the uppermost 150 meters of this bolson-fill.
Recent studies suggest a major lake named Lake Cabeza de
Vaca (Strain, 1966) existed in the Hueco Balson during the late
Quaternary.
It was drained during the Pliocene (Hawley, 1975)
or late Kansan of the Pleistocene (Strain, 1966) by a river
system, ancestral perhaps to the Rio Grande, which flowed
through Fillmore Pass and continued southeast into Big Bend.
This system deposited the fluvial gravels of the Camp Rice
Formation which rest unconformably upon the lacustrine clays
of the Fort Hancock Formation (Strain, 1966).
It is herein
proposed instead, that a late Quaternary southward-trending,
through-flowing, coarse-grained fluvial system drained the
entire Tularosa Basin.
This stream incised into lacustrine
sediments of ancestral Lake Otero, a lake system which occupied
almost the entire Tularosa Basin and included Lake Cabeza de
Vaca to the south.
EVIDENCE
Remote Sensing and Topography
An analysis of the Apollo photograph series (e.g. Figs. Ila, lb) reveals a series of subparallel sinuous lineations in
the Hueco Balson.
These may be traced almost continuously from
the junction with the Rio Grande northward up along the western
margin of the Tularosa Basin to the Malpais lava flow.
Dendritic lineations also originate from the Sacramento Mountains on the eastern side of the basin and disappear beneath
White Sands.
These lineations form topographic linear troughs
which, except for those in the southern part of the study area,
presently pond sediment and water discharges from the alluvial
fans.
A complete integration of these troughs is prevented by
bolson-fill.
Subsurface Analysis
Sand percentage and sand number maps (Figs, I-2, I-3) were
made using 76 electric logs and lithic logs of area water-well
tests published by the U.S.G.S. (Knowles and Kennedy, 1956;
Lyford, 1970).
Sand number, as used here, refers to number of
individual packages of sands separated above and below by clays
or gravels within a core section.

analysis are arbitrarily limited to the upper 150 meters of
penetration (deepest channel base observed) and do not include
the top 15 meters to minimize complications due to pedogenesis
and incomplete core recovery.
The sand percentage map (Fig. I-2) shows two distinct
linear sand trends: one follows the mountain ranges on the west
and the other traces closely the low sinuosity topographic
troughs and lineations observed from remote sensing.
The
central sand accumulation forms multilateral sand facies with
a high width/thickness ratio.
This facies is also relatively
low in sand number whereas the sands near the mountains are
high in sand number (Fig. I-3).
Electric and lithic logs within the sand body proximal to
the mountain ranges show coarsening upward sequences representative of prograding alluvial fans (for similar interpretations
of these core data and the following, see summaries by Shelton,
1973, and Reinick and Singh, 1973).
The lithic logs of the sand
body within the basin exhibit morphologies common to channels:
abbreviated fining-upward sequences, sharp bases, and thick
multi-storied bodies.
It should be noted that sand features
characteristic of channels are lacking within the entire 300
meters of logged profiles taken within Fillmore Pass.
This
observation weakens Strain's (1966) hypothesis of an early
stream following this route.
A thick monotonous deposit of
clay, representative of the distal Gilbert deltas of lacustrine
environments, is found between these two linear sand accumulations and to the east of the basinal trend.
The average sand
body thickness and number of sand bodies within a section is
compared in Figure I-4.
The almost continuous spectrum of this
inverse correlation illustrates the gradational boundary between
these facies in terms of sand geometry alone.
Those sands with
good channel characteristics, though, differ by having the
thicker and fewer in number sand bodies.
A genetic interpretation of this subsurface cross-section is shown in Figure I-5.
Cursory analysis of deeper well data suggests a similar
assemblage of environments may have occurred previously in the
basin.
This channel sand and the lacustrine clay unit which it
cuts may be traced within the subsurface southward to where
they crop out in the southern Hueco Balson as the Camp Rice
sands, unconformably overlying the Fort Hancock clays.
These
fluvial and lacustrine units may also be traced northward in
the subsurface to beneath White Sands (Fig. I-lb).
For example,
four cores taken by McKee and Moiola (1975) are underlain at
about eight meters depth by three meters of fluvial deposits,
which in turn are underlain by lacustrine sediments.
Field Observations and Pioneering Efforts
The apparent incomplete Holocene integration of the many
channels within the Tularosa Basin was previously noted.

GEOMORPHOLOGY AND SOILS

Harrington (1885) first observed these blindly-ending tributaries and suggested the existence of an ancestral main drainage.
Furthermore, he theorized that the disappearance of the
channel was due to its filling by the Malpais lava flow.
He
reported the lava flow to be of recent age due to the abandoned
ruins within the valley and a legend
. of the Indians which tells of a year of
fire, when this valley was so filled with flames
and poisonous gases as to be made uninhabitable.
The geometry of the lava flow, as shown in Figure I-lb, does
fill a linear trough suggestive of a stream precursor.
Weber
(1977) has obtained fluvial gravels from beneath the flow,
substantiating the fluvial hypothesis.
He suggests (Weber
1964) that the freshness of surficial flow features and lack of
erosional dissection point to a recent origin of the Malpais,
estimating an age of 1000 to 1500 years.
For the purpose of
this analysis the date of 1500 B.P. will be used.
His data
provides, then, an estimate on the latest date this major
tributary was occluded.
On th£ western side of th£ lava flow,
where it is presently incised by a small arroyo, it is underlain
by laminated gypsum-rich clays interpreted as a lacustrine unit.
At the extreme southern part of the lava flow, waters discharge
from the permeable fluvial gravels beneath into a small pond
filled with pup-fish, biological evidence of a oncecommunicating f luvial system.
These lacustrine and f luvial
uriits correlate with those described previously by McKee and
Moiola (1975) to occur beneath White Sands.
From evidence
of old strand lines, Herrick (1904) had first hypothesized
the existence of a Tertiary Lake Otero within the Tularosa
Basin, which he said might have extended as far south of White
Sands to the Jarilla Mountains.
From the previous field and
subsurface evidence, we extend this lacustrine unit and thus
his ancestral Lake Otero from beneath the Malpais flow southward
to include Lake Cabe~a de Vaca.
On the eastern side of the Tularosa Valley, exposed within
arroyo cuts near the Sacramento Mountains, are at least two
massive, laterally continuous, laminated five meters thick clay
beds which are incised by alluvial fan channel gravels.
This
observation extends the lake and fluvial gravels to the eastern
side of the Tularosa Valley, south of where the large dendritic
arroyo scars appear on the Apollo photographs (I-lb).
Similar
profiles exist on the western edge of the Tularosa Basin.
Here,
on the eastern side of the Franklin Mountains, lacustrine clays
first described by Hill (1891) have bentonite beds that may
correlate to those described in the southern Hueco Balson by
Strain (1966).
Sedimentary structures within the fluvial unit exposed
north of the Texas border (Fig. I-la) are large-scale tabular
and festoon cross-beds of coarse sands exhibiting predominate

downdip flow directions to the south.
Textural analysis of the
materials within the different facies, when compared with
present-day active eolian, fluvial, and lacustrine deposits, are
similar and support the paleoenvironmental interpretation.
The
lithology of the sands and gravels within the fluvial deposits
represent a Tularosa provenance (diorites, rhyolites,
calcarenites, dolomites, etc.) and do not carry the exotics
(e.g. Triassic red sandstone clasts) that the Rio Grande
fluvial terraces contain.
Taken together with the absence of
channel characteristics within the cores of Fillmore Pass,
this evidence argues against an ancestral channel flowing
through this pass.
SYNTHESIS
During the late Quaternary a large lake system, termed
Lake Otero, extended from the northern Tularosa Basin southward
into the Hueco Balson, deposits of which form the Fort Hancock.
Following the draining of the lake, a through-flowing stream
with tributaries draining the surrounding mountains flowed
across the Tularosa Basin into the Hueco Balson, depositing the
Camp Rice Formation.
In the subsurface this sand unit forms a
thick, linear body that traces the troughs and lineations
visible topographically and from space photographs.
This
multilateral sand facies with a high width/thickness ratio has
the associated structures and textures and low sinuosity surface
channel features diagnostic of a braided-stream model (Fisher
and Brown, 1972).
The economic importance of a genetic interpretation of
these sand units within the basin is two-fold.
Firstly, sand
and gravel operations may be keyed into areas of maxima
indicated by the percentage sand maps.
The fluvial linear sand
body contains waters with a high concentration of dissolv~d
gypsum (data from Knowles and Kennedy, 1956}, derived from the
outcropping Permian evaporites in the northern Basin.
Therefore, the alluvial fan sands and gravels which pinch out in the
clays distally provide the better target for a potable ground
water supply, a second economic resource.
The exact timing of the demise of this river is difficult
to ascertain, but the filling of a major tributary by a late
volcanic eruption and the accompanying initiation of the White
Sand dune field to additionally occlude other tributaries,
effectively shut the fluvial system down.
Unfortunately, no
datable material has been recovered from beneath the lava flow
for radiocarbon analysis.
Climate changes are another variable
which could affect stream channel maintenance within this basin.
For example, an increase of the area's evaporation/precipitation
ratio to the present value of ten, since the Wisconsin might
tend to decrease vegetation cover and thus bank stability with
the added initiation of more active eolian deposits.
Such
factors would contribute to the occlusion of the main

tributaries.
But given the extremely rapid rate of bolson
alluviation, it is not unreasonable to speculate that the
drainage scars represent discharge events that could have ended
about the time the lava flow is conjectured to have occurred,
1000 to 1500 years ago.
Although this young age is highly
speculative, the potential archeological ramifications of such
a late drainage within the Tularosa Basin are considerable.
PEDOLOGIC ANALYSIS AND SETTLEMENT PATTERNS
Accompanying alluvial fan and eolian contributions to the
bolson fill within the Tularosa Valley are discussed in th~
previous section.
Active pedologic processes were concomittant
with the geologic ones.
The soils and paleosols of
approximately 1500 B.P. covering the Dona Ana Range are shown
in Figure I-6.
These were mapped using: 1) 1:25,000 scale
projections of N.A.S.A. Apollo Space photographs; 2) 1:50,000
U.S. Army topographic maps; and 3) 1:24,000 U.D.G.S. topographic maps.
In selecting map units by photo-interpretive
mapping, primary emphasis is placed on color and albedo of
ground surfaces and on topographic-geomorphic relationships
(Morrison, 1969).
These indicators are then checked in th~
field and classified according to the Soil Survey Staff's
seventh Approximation (1967).
The paleosols were mapped by:
1) examining the Apollo Space photographs which give hints as
to the deflation soils through color and albedo differences;
and by 2) the less technologically sophisticated but more
reliable method of lateral relationships obtained by trenching
soil profiles in the field.
Engineering aspects of these soils
have been generally described by Maker et al. (1971; 1972) and
will not be discussed here.
By comparison with their approach,
this soil survey is a pedologic one in which processes and
responses have been emphasized for both the present-day soils
and the paleosols as an aid in the environmental reconstruction
for anthropological analyses.
Such surveys have been previously
conducted for the eastern Tularosa Basin (Pigott 1977a) and for
the western Hueco Balson (Pigott 1977b).
Table I-1 compares the areal distribution between the
paleosols of approximately 1500 B.P. and the present soil
cover.
The coppice sand dune soils, the torripsamments,
occupy the greatest area at present, 78~64 percent.
These soils
have provided the greatest change through the time period
studied.
The dunes represent a recent invasion of post-1885
(Gile 1966) and bury paleosols with a sharp, unconformable,
easily mapped surface.
As a consequence of this eolian event,
the caliche soils, calciorthids, and the calcified clays, the
paleargids, have declined in areal coverage through time.
Similarly, by the advancement of sand dunes upon the playa
lake soils, the torriaquents1 have decreased from a 2.68 percent
coverage to a mere 0.08 percent surface.
These ephemeral lakes

PEDOLOGIC ANALYSIS AND SETTLEMENT PATTERNS

211

retain surface water a few centimeters in depth for only a
matter of hours following a locally intense rain.
However,
these torriaquents can remain saturated within the top meter
for weeks after the rain event due to the impermeability of
the underlying montmorillonite clays.
For the last 1500 years,
the well indurated caliche soils, the paleorthids, and the rocky
soils on the mountains, the lithic paleorthids, have undergone
the least spatial change.
Although comparisons between the distributions of presentday soils and the distributions of aboriginal sites are easily
done, correlations are meaningless if the present-day soils
differ greatly from the soils extant during occupation.
Therefore, as shown by Table I-1, a paleosol .analysis would be a
more rational vehicle for determining settlement patterns.
Because these paleosols have retained much of their present
character since the last pluvial, they are valid imprints of
an environment which has only changed slightly in comparison
to that of ten thousand years ago.
But first a short digression
concerning the sampling program is necessary.
Sampling for data interpretation is usually either done
randomly or non-randomly.
The advantages of the former in
statistical treatments are sometimes offset by the disadvantages
of sampling known barren areas and missing potentially more
favorable areas by being the slave of purely random sampling
design.
The disadvantages of the non-statistically valid
approach are somewhat offset by surveying known or predicted
sites.
The design for Dona Ana Range contains an element of
both.
There is a noticable change in the diameter, hence the
area, of prehistoric sites over time.
For instance, El Paso
Phase sites are considerably larger than Mesilla Phase sites.
Consequently, random transverse sampling cannot provide a
true approximation of the number of each site.
As an example,
if the El Paso Phase sites have a diameter that is approximately twice that of the Mesilla Phase sites, even if there
are twice as many Mesilla sites as there are El Paso site, the
number of intersections of transverse sampling will be about
equal.
Instead, if grid sampling from random numbers is employed as is the case for this study, with areas greatly exceeding
site diameters these biases are compensated.
In addition,
known and potentially favorable site-areas were surveyed outside
of these quadrants in order that they be studied and compared
to the others.
Economy of time and materials necessitated the strategem
of sampling approximately ten percent of the available Dona Ana
Range area.
Some ninety-six kilometer-squares were randomly
generated to cover the approximately 960 kilometers of the study
area.
For those few quadrants not completely square due to
boundary restrictions, neighboring geometrically complementing
partitions were added.
The random numbers u. in the range
l<u.<1010

derived

Packard 1975): u. =the fractional part of (n + u. - 1) 5
which is multiplted by 1010.
The new "seed" is r~covered
simply by dividing Ui by 1010.
One may now test the validity of the sampling procedure by
checking if it includes the major pedologic zones.
This is
additionally a check upon other ecologic and physiographic zones
which could be ·included.
Table I-2 demonstrates that for all
soil subdivisions mapped (shown in Fig. I-6), the sampled area
reproduces with surprising accuracy the frequencies and areas
theoretically predicted if the sample were purely random.
A
chi-square test with eight degrees of freedom yields a value of
1.61 which statistically says that there is only about two
chances in 100 that the sampling distribution does not reflect
the universe sampled.
Figure 7 graphically illustrates this.
Now that the validity of the sampling method is apparent
we may begin to test the different occupation areas for soil
affinities.
The sites have been grouped into the following
categories: 1) Isolated Hearths, Nonceramic, Indeterminate;
2) Chipped Stone Scatter, (Archaic?); 3) Small Camps, Nonceramic, Indeterminate; 4) Mesilla Phase-Small Camps, Ceramic
Scatter, Chipped Stone/Ceramic Scatter, Isolated HearthsCeramic; 5) El Paso Phase-Small Camp Ceramic, Chipped Stone/
Ceramic Scatter, Isolated Hearths-Ceramic; 6) Complex Camps,
Nonceramic, (Archaic?); 7) Complex Camps, Ceramic, Intermediate
size, Mesilla Phase; 8) Large Complex Camps, Mesilla Phase;
and 9) Village Complex, El Paso and Mesilla Phases.
The cumulative areas of the various site types are plotted
according to their distance from the paleo-playa strandlines
in Figure 8, graphically illustrating that all examples of site
type 9, Village Complex Camps of both Mesilla and El Paso
phases, cluster within three kilometers of these water sources.
The correlation between this occupational site type and the more
arable soils in proximity to water sources is to be expected in
light of the agricultural economy practiced.
Using chi-square tests for site numbers as shown in Table
I-3, camp type (7), the Mesilla Phase complex camps, ceramic,
of intermediate size, appear to occur on the paleargids more
often than would be expected if the sites were normally distributed on soil frequencies identical to that of the sampling
design.
Alpha for this test is equal to 0.1 and thus is not
completely statistically significant.
(Note: although we have
shown that the sample design closely approximates the sampling
universe, it would be incorrect to perform a chi-square test
using the spatial analysis of soil frequencies of the universe
rather than the design for the calculation of expected values)~
By contrast, the site type (9), the Village Complex, (El Paso
and Mesilla Phases) shows a very strong, statistically
significant, affinity for the paleargids.
For this chi-square
test, alpha is 0.01.
In sum then, a slight tendency is shown
for the site type 7 Mesilla Phase complex camp to occur on
paleargids.
The Village Complexes, on the oth~r hand, show a

preference for the paleargid soils very similar to a trend
reported for the western Hueco Balson (Pigott 1977b).
The
association here was felt to represent a real trend in resource
utilization: that is, with increasing agricultural technology,
the advantages of clayey soils may have been attractive.
In order to determine the potential settlement interaction
with playas, the distribution of site area frequencies and
relative frequencies were determined as distance from paleoplaya strandlines (beaches or rims).
The Isolated Hearths, Nonceramic, site type (1) is very
negatively associated with the playas (alpha is 0.005).
This
may suggest a less agrarian mode of life.
On the other hand,
the nonceramic Complex Camps of site type (6), probably of
Archaic age, show a slight positive affinity (alpha is only
0.1), for the playas.
The strong association of site type (9)
Village Complex, Mesilla and El Paso Phase, with the playas is
demonstrated by an alpha of .005.
Although there are rough
departures from the expected distribution for the other types,
they do not differ significantly from that of the normally
distributed sampling quadrants.
Another useful feature of the
graph of Figure 8 is its ability to portray how much of a
certain type lies within a given distance from the playa rims.
For example, for sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, 50 percent of
the settlement area lies within about 7.5 kilometers of the
playa strandlines.
If one were concerned chiefly with areas
with high site density, one recommendation for future archeological inventory would be to concentrate on the playa areas
shown in Figure 8.
With a much larger sampling program, the
intricacies of the associations reflected in these analyses
could be better resolved.

ANALYSIS OF PREHISTORIC CERAMICS
OF DONA ANA RANGE
Nancy Kays Smiley

ABSTRACT
Description and analyses were performed on ?13 ceramic
sherds and artifacts collected on Dona Ana Range.
Fourteen
previously described ceramic types are recognized in the
material and are categorized accordinq to vessel shape, rim
style, miscellaneous form and unusual' chaPacteristics of
firing and finishing.
Post-firing modifications, such as
worked sherds and repair holes, are analyzed for all types.
A tabulation of ceramic types by site is made.
Using information on the presence or absence of ceramic types at individual sites, the geographical distribution of ceramics is
analyzed.
Suggestions are made concerning settlement patterning on Dona Ana Range in the Mesilla, Dona Ana, and El Paso
phases.
Finally, comparisons are made with ceramic data
gathered by others in the general vicinity of Dona Ana Range,
and suggestions are made for further work in the area.
INTRODUCTION
JORNADA BRANCH CERAMICS
The broad variety of intrusive ceramics found in the
Jornada Branch of the Mogollon demonstrates trading relationships that persisted over centuries,
The Jornada Branch has
always been considered peripheral to the central core of the
Southwestern culture area, but much of the present evidence
shows it to have been an integral part of a large trade
system of goods.
Ceramics that originated in southeast and
east central Arizona, western, central, and southeast New
Mexico, and Chihuahua, Mexico, are found in Jornada Branch
sites.
El Paso Polychrome, a type indigenous to the southern
Jornada Branch, is found in most of these areas in varying
quantities, indicating that th£re existed a two-way exchange
of ceramics, and probably other goods as well.
Lehmer (1948) outlined the archeological sequence of th£
Jornada Branch on the basis of architectural styles and ceramic
types.
His reasoning has yet to be disproved and will be followed
here.
According to Lehmer's scheme, the first ceramic phase in
the southern sector of the Jornada Branch, the Mesilla Phase,
lasted from approximately A.D. 900 to 1100.
New evidence from
radiocarbon dates obtained on McGregor Range extends the beginning

226

CERAMIC ANALYSIS

date of the Mesilla Phase back to A.D. 700-800.
Brethauer
(1977) dates the onset of the Mesilla Phase to A.D. 500.
Lehmer states that ceramic types characteristic of the
Mesilla Phase are derived primarily from the Mimbres Branch
of the western Mogollon.
El Paso Brown, a coarse, local relative of Alma Plain, dominates the assemblages.
This type and
El Paso Bichrome styles, forerunners of El Paso Polychrome,
begin to appear as indigenous types at this time.
Mimbres
area types, such as Mimbres Boldface and Classic Black on
White~ Mimbres Corrugated, San Francisco Red, and Alma Plain,
appear intermittently.
The ensuing Doffa Ana Phase (ca. A.D. 1100 to 1200)
represents a transition between the Mesilla Phase and the
more complex assemblages of the later El Paso Phase.
Characteristically, sherds of El Paso Brown and Polychrome represent
over half of the total sherd count for collections from the
area.
However, traces of the Mimbres types, with the exception
of Mimbres Boldface, continue to appear.
New types which are
found on Dona Ana Phase sites are: Chupadero Black on White,
Three Rivers Red on Terracotta, San Andres Red on Terracotta
and St. Johns Polychrome.
These later types indicate a substantial broadening of the sphere of interaction and trade on
the part of Jornada peoples.
On El Paso Phase sites (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400) an even
greater indication of the interaction with outside areas is
apparent.
El Paso Polychrome is the dominant ware; up to 98
percent of the ceramic collections consist of sherds of this
type.
However, new types from northwest Chihuahua begin to
appear in substantial numbers.
Seao Corrugated, Lincoln
Black on White, Tuason Polychrome, Gila Polychrome, Agua
Frio Glaze I and Arenal Glaze Polychrome are other new types.
St. Johns Polychrome and Mimbres Classic Black on White
continue at these sites.
In addition to the types cited by
Lehmer, collections from the McGregor Range Survey performed
by the Texas Archeological Survey include other types from
all phases including: Three Circle Red on White (an early
Mimbres type), Reserve Plain Corrugated and Tularosa Patterned
Corrugated (from the Reserve area of west central New Mexico),
Galisteo Black on White (from the northern Rio Grande area),
and Ochoa Brown Smudged Indented (from southeast New Mexico)
(Smiley 1977).
It is apparent that the lower Tularosa Basin
was receiving ceramics from each of the surrounding pottery
producing areas.
Tree-ring dates (Breternitz 1966) were used whenever
possible to date particular ceramic types found on this survey.
Very few types have been really well-dated by dendrochronology,
so co-occurrence with other dated ceramic types and architectural styles, radiocarbon assays, and judgement about the
temporality of particular types were all used to produce a
time chart for the ceramics (Yigure II-1).

CERAMIC ANALYSIS

The presence of El Paso Polychrome and/or other later
ceramic types was used to differentiate Dona Ana and El Paso
phase sites from the earlier Mesilla Phase sites.
It must
be remembered that on a surface survey, judgements of site
temporality are made according to surface indications only.
This produces somewhat arbitrary results; for instance, a site
exhibiting El Paso Phase materials may be masking a Mesilla
Phase component.
New work by DiPeso, Rinaldo and Fenner (1976) may revise
some of the current ideas on the role and dates of Casas
Grandes ceramic types present in the Tularosa Basin, but this
will probably refine, rather than revise, Lehmer's phases,
which are loosely constructed.
Much more work is needed before we have an accurate idea
of the time span of El Paso Brown and Polychrome, the ceramic
types most basic to our understanding of the El Paso expression
of the Jornada Branch.
These types appear to have been extremely
long-lived and geographically localized; more radiocarbon and
tree-ring dates in association with technological information
on physical constituents and surface finishing should help to
define their place in Jornada Branch prehistory (Dulaney and
Pigott 1977).
THE DONA ANA RANGE SURVEY
In 1975 and 1976, the Texas Archeological Survey
performed a sampling survey of McGregor Guided Missile Range,
Otero County, New Mexico.
At that time, extensive sampling
of ceramic materials was carried out and later analyzed in
the laboratory.
In 1977, a survey of the contiguous Dona
Ana Military Range offered an opportunity to augment our
knowledge of the lower Tularosa Basin.
Because of the previous
work done with McGregor ceramics, it was considered unnecessary
to make large collections in the field.
Past experience had
shown us the difficulty of trying to collect completely representative samples in an area where military activity and sh~fting
sands have obliterated site boundaries.
We considered it
preferable to collect and study only those materials which
provided the most information about the sites from which they
came.
The Sampling Strategy
A small sample of local brownware (El Paso Brown and
Polychrome) sherds was collected from each ceramic site in
order to obtain local ceramic material for
tests.
Whenever possible, rim sherds were
larger informational content on rim style,
orifice diameter.
Rim sherds also help to

THE DONA ANA SURVEY

229

The presence of Chupadero Black on White and Mimbres
Classic Black on White was noted, but samples were rarely
collected.
These types are common intrusives in the lower
Tularosa Basin.
Samples of atypical local brownware or unidentifiable
sherds of plain and decorated wares were collected for further
laboratory study.
Again, rim sherds were preferred.
In practice, the sampling strategy worked quite well.
Small sites with very few ceramics were not collected, but
the types present were noted.
Rims were picked up whenever
possible.
Because the field personnel were occasionally
unsure of the identifications of Mimbres Black on White and
Chupadero Black on White, these were occasionally collected
as well.
Table II-13 lists all collected and observed ceramics
by site number.
It is important to remember the sampling
strategy when using this table; the analysis is based upon the
presence or absence of particular ceramic types rather than
upon a representative number of sherds.
In all, 713 sherds from 113 sites were collected and
analyzed.
Fourteen previously established types are represented.
This sample was not adequate for a detailed comparative study of rim forms, vessel shapes and sizes,
Rather,
the ceramic material from Dona Ana Range was related to the
materials previously described from McGregor Range.
Ceramic
type categories and rim form types, and the presentation
format of the McGregor report (Smiley 1977) are followed
for ease in comparison.
TYPE DESCRIPTIONS AND ANALYSIS
In this section, the ceramic data from Dona Ana Range
is arranged by type.
Technical descriptions of these types
are not provided but are referenced in the specific discussions.
No attempt was made to define or redefine each type, although
comments on construction and finishing were made if unusual
specimens were found in the collection.

CERAMIC ANALYSIS

EL PASO BROWN (Fig. II-2a,b)
El Paso Brown is considered the earliest ceramic type
of the southern Jornada Branch, a local variant of Alma Plain.
It generally serves as a diagnostic marker of the Mesilla
Phase, and the beginning date of the Mesilla Phase has recently
been pushed back to ca. A.D. 500 (Brethauer 1977: 6).
The
manufacture of El Paso B~own continued for an undetermined
length of time, until perhaps as late as 1350.
El Paso Polychrome,
a painted version of El Paso Brown, arose during the late
Mesilla Phase and completely dominated the local brownware
complex by the El Paso Phase.
A difficulty arises in trying to separate El Paso Brown
from unpainted portions of El Paso Polychrome vessels on the
basis of sherds alone.
For the purposes of this study, all
unpainted local brownware sherds collected were designated
El Paso Brown, even though many of them very likely came from
El Paso Polychrome vessels.
Since this study of Dona Ana
Range ceramics makes use of presence/absence data only, the
amount of each type is not a crucial factor.
Any El Paso
Polychrome sherds at a site caused it to be recorded as
an El Paso Phase site.
When unpainted brownware sherds,
including rims, were observed unaccompanied by any other
ceramic types, the site was placed in the Mesilla Phase.
A
small number of El Paso Brown body sherds at a site caused
it to be called "Indeterminate".
A factor of potential importance is the disappearance of
paint from El Paso Polychrome sherds because of exposure to
weathering.
Figure II-2d,e shows several such sherds that
have been partially weathered.
These examples show how paint
can completely disappear, thus causing misidentification of
the type.
As Figure II-2f ,g demonstrates, weathering can
also roughen polished surfaces.
As a consequence, surface
texture is not a reliable indicator of type.
Rim types and sizes provide an excellent means for
segregating El Paso Brown and Polychrome types.
Whalen
(1978) has recently studied in depth the variety in these
rim forms, dividing them into "Earlier" and "Later" types.
Dulaney and Pigott (1977}~ in their discussion of the
mineral constituents of the ceramics from McGregor Range,
conclude that the two types are made from slightly different
materials but that further investigation is necessary to
determine if this is really the case.
Both types, however,
seem to be of local manufacture.

EL PASO POLYCHROME
EZ Paso Polychrome is considered indigenous to the southern
Tularosa Basin (Lehmer 1948: 46) and a diagnostic marker of
the Do~a Ana and El Paso phases.
It is not yet clear if this
type was manufactured all over the entire southern basin or
only in particular centers.
Its presence in large quantities
at sites both in and out of the basin, and as far away as
Casas Grandes and the Mimbres Valley, argues for widespread
manufacture and/or trade.
DiPeso (1976) believes that this
type may have served as a "tin can" of prehistoric trade;
the large size of the standard olla, its thin walls and
less-than-careful decoration suggest a large, cheap, lightweight, and disposable vessel which may have been used in
conjunction with a trade commodity such as pifion nuts.
Also the presence of many Chihuahuan ceramic types from
the Casas Grandes area furthers th_e idea of active trading
with that region.
Recently, Whalen (1978) has seriated
rim farms from the Hue co Balson, just sou th of the sou th_ern
Tularosa Basin.
His derived subtypes, "Earlier" and "Later",
are to be found in this typology, but not separated into
chronological groupings.

Lehmer (1948: 76) states that bichrome and polychrome styles
began to evolve from El Paso Brohln in the Mesilla Phase, or
sometime before A.D. 1100. El Paso Polychrome traditionally
serves as a diagnostic marker for the Dona Ana and El Paso
phases, or the pueblo period of Jornada Branch archeology.
Description of Rim Sherds
Rim type numbers and illustrations are taken from
Smiley (1977: Figure II-30).

CERAMIC ANALYSIS

generally believed to have been manufactured in the vicinity
of southern Torrance County and eastern Socorro County, New
Mexico.
Kelley has recently suggested that it had a more
widespread manufacture; it occurs in such substantial quantities (20 to 30 percent of the total ceramic complex) in the
Sierra Blanca region that this seems likely.
However, the
type is relatively uniform, suggesting a limited center or
centers (Kelley 1966: 171).
Kelley is at present performing
mineralogical tests upon samples of this type in order to
determine its place or places of manufacture,

between 1250 and 1400.

THREE RIVERS RED ON TERRACOTTA
This type originates in the northern Tularosa Basin
from 10 miles south of Alamogordo to north around Corona.
Vessels were imported into the lower basin area in fairly
substantial numbers along with related types San Andres Red
on Terracotta and Lincoln Black on Red during the Dona Ana
and El Paso phases.
Temporally and morphologically, Three
Rivers Red on Terracotta overlaps to a great extent with San
Andres Red on Terracotta.
In fact, it may be more useful to
consider them together although there is reason to believe
that the San Andres preceded the Three Rivers Red on Terracotta.
In this study, the two types were distinguished on the basis
of paste color, surface color, painted line width, and size
of temper.
San Andres Red on Terracotta tends to be browner,
have broader painted lines, and coarser temper,
Three J?i;veps
Red on Terracotta has more orange in the paste and surface
color, thinner painted lines, and finer temper.
However,
none of these criteria were inviolable.
The combination of
factors has been taken into account in dividing sherds into
these two categories.

MIMBRES CLASSIC BLACK ON WHITE
Mimbres Classic Black on White originated in the Mimhres
Valley and may also have been manufactured by colonies of
Mimbres people located in the western part of the Jornada
Branch (Lehmer 1948: 71).
Its importation into the Tularosa
Basin began in the Mesilla Phase and reached its peak in th~
Dona Ana Phase.
Some of this type was still being imported
in the El Paso Phase.
The quantity of this type found in the
Tularosa Basin indicates heavy trade with that area of th~

CORRALITOS POLYCHROME INCISED
Lehmer (1948: 81) states the Chih.uahuan wares appear in
the southern Tularosa Basin in the El Paso Phase, Dil?eso,
Rinaldo and Fenner (1976) however, give new dates to these
types which may alter the beginning date of this phase to an
earlier point.
Corralitos Polychrome was made in tfLe }ledi.o
Period (A.D. 1060 to 1340) which corresponds to Lehllie.rts
Mesilla Phase.
When this type was first imported into tfLe_
Tularosa Basin remains to be determined.

Summary of CorraZitos Polychrome Incised
The two jar body sherds found on one site (P-116) have
only been tentatively identified as Corralitos Polychrome
Incised.
They are most certainly Chihuahuan in origin.
UNIDENTIFIED PLAINWARE
One jar body sherd was collected from site D-80.
UNIDENTIFIED PAINTED WARES
Descriptions
Two jar body sherds which could be fitted together
appear to come from the ceramic type reported by Smiley
(1977: 198, Unidentified Painted Sherds No. 6).
The
temper is small-grained sand.
The interior surface is of
a sandpaper quality, smoothed but not polished.
The exterior
is painted red; no designs are apparent but the surface is
well-polished.
One jar body sherd of unidentified type was collected.
It has gray-brown paste with very fine-grained temper particles.
The painted exterior is washed with red paint; part of a
black-line geometric design is superimposed.
The interior
is gray and is quite well-smoothed.
POST-FIRING MODIFICATIONS
WORKED SHERDS
A worked sherd is one which, after firing and breakage,
has been shaped by edge-grinding.
In the past, worked sherds
found in the Southwest have been called counters, pendants,
tools, or else have not been assigned a functional name.
In
most cases, these specimens have been triangular, rectangular,
or disc-shaped, often with perforations.

a.

Convex facet, exterior bevel*. This potsherd exhibits a convex facet, beveled on
its exterior surface. This would result if the potter held the sherd at an angle
with the fingers on the concave or interior surface and the thumb on the
exterior surface; as a scraping motion is performed towards the body on the
interior of the vessel, the observed wear pattern results.

b.

Convex facet, flat or rounded edge surface. The flat wear pattern is achieved
by holding the sherd at a 90 degree angle to the interior wall of a clay vessel
while shaping or scraping. A slightly rounded surface would result if the
tool were used at a slight angle on either side of the facet.

c.

Convex facet, interior bevel. This wear pattern would result if the sherd were
held in the opposite manner from that of example A and used, as in example
A, to shape the interior of a vessel.

Bevel denotes the angle of the facet, either on the exterior or interior surface of
the sherd.

CERAMIC ANALYSIS

256

The typology, descriptions, and interpretation of worked
sherds given here was derived from the analysis of the ceramics
of McGregor Range (Smiley 1977: 200).
Of the five categories
of sherd modification defined in that analysis, only two are
found in the Dona Ana collection.
Five worked sherds and one
possibly modified ceramic fragment comprise the total sample
from Dona Ana (Fig. II-6).
These worked sherds were probably used as scrapers or
shapers in the manufacture of ceramic vessels.
As a rule,
these artifacts are irregular in shape and exhibit worn facets
along one or more edges; all the Dona Ana examples are worked
on only one edge, perhaps a result of post-working breakage.
Table II-10 compares the worked sh~rds of each wear pattern
with the ceramic type to which they belong.
Since the sample
size is so small, little can be concluded about any preference
for ceramic types or wear patterns resulting from modification
of the sherd.

It can be hypothesized that there is a higher probability
that ceramics were manufactured at large multi-featured sites,
such as villages, than at smaller, simpler sites.
In the small
sample collected on Dona Ana Range, five of the six worked sherds
were found at complex camps; one was recovered at a small camp
site.
This limited data lends credence to the idea that these
sherd tools are more likely to be found at sites where a greater
range of activities were performed.
REPAIR HOLES
Four sherds have repair holes; all but one of these, an El
Paso Brown fragment, are rims.
Rims have a tendency to crack;
small holes drilled bracketing the crack and tied with string
prevent the crack from spreading.
The holes were drilled with
pointed tools, probably wooden or bone awls, usually from the
exterior of the vessel.
The holes were finished by drilling
from the interior.
The repair holes analyzed in the McGregor
Range ceramics ranged from 2.5 to 8 mm. in width.
In cases
of rim repair, they were usually drilled about 1.5 to 2 cm.
from the edge of the rim,
It has been suggested that these holes
were used to suspend the vessels; however, they are too small
and too close to the rim and no signs of wear were observed on

CERAMIC ANALYSIS

the edges of any of the holes.
The ceramic types of the repaired vessels from Dona Ana
are:
three El Paso Brown sherds, two Chupadero Black on White
sherds, and one Mimbres Black on White fragment.
One of the
El Paso Brown sherds was incompletely drilled from the exterior;
it seems probable that the vessel broke during the repair process.
The Mimbres sherd has two repair holes near the rim and
only 3 cm. apart.
Apparently this bowl was kept in good repair
and not discarded despite at least two cracks, probably because
Mimbres Black on White was valued for its beauty and elaboration
in design.
INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY
The survey of Dona Ana Range performed by the Texas
Archeological Survey, which did not emphasize collecting,
recovered a total of 713 ceramic sherds and artifacts.
Over 99
percent of this material can be assigned to one of twelve ty~es
(Tabl: II-I).
~z Paso Brown, El Paso Polychrome, Chupader-;;--Black
on Wh~te, and M~mbres Classic Black on White are the most common.
THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF TYPES
A study of ceramic type distributions was carried out to
test the hypothesis that different ceramic types would show nonrandom distributional patterns on Dona Ana Range.
This was
accomplished by the use of map pins of different colors on a
large-scale U. S. Army map of the Range.
The twelve ceramic types
examined were grouped for simplicity into Mimbres Black on White
(both Boldface and Classic), the Chihuahuan wares (all types and
varieties), Chupadero Black on White, White Mountain Redware,
Three Rivers Redwares (Three Rivers Red on Terracotta and San
Andres Red on Terracotta), and Brownware-only sites (El Paso
Brown and El Paso Polychrome). All sites contained brownware;
its occurrence was mapped only when unaccompanied by other types.
The sampling program on this survey employed a series of
96 l-km2 survey units randomly scattered over the Range except
in the mountainous Impact Area, which was not surveyed (Fig. 2).
It is immediately apparent that the sites of high ceramic
diversity (i.e. highest number of types) are concentrated in
specific zones.
The first group are clustered in four survey
units (44, 49, 55· and 61) on the lower alluvial fans of the
Organ Mountains along the 4000 foot contour line.
In addition,
there are three sites in two other survey units (Nos. 88 and 93)
which belong to this group, located across the Range on the
alluvial fans in association with Elephant Mountain and Rattlesnake Hill.
The latter are outliers of the Jarilla Mountains.
The ceramically-diverse sites in these survey units contain

Chupadero Black on White, Three Rivers Redware, Mimbres Black on
White, White Mountain Redware, and Chihuahuan wares. They are
village sites with visible structures and ceramically they are

CORRELATION OF TYPES

263

comparable to the village sites of Quadrat II on McGregor
Range (Smiley 1977).
Across the Old Coe Lake depression
from these sites lies another group of survey units (42, 59,
63, 81 and 90) with sites of fairly high ceramic diversity.
These are also near the 4000 foot contour line, but are situated
on a very slight slope which dips down to the west.
Ceramics
found in these sites include Chupadero Black on White, Mimbres
Black on White, and Chihuahuan wares.
White Mountain Redware
and Three Rivers Redware are absent.
All other areas of Dona Ana Range show .Ex>ownware-only sites
exclusively.
In summary, sites of highest ceramic diversity cluster
around the Old Coe Lake depression around the 4000 foot contour
line, or on the lower alluvial slopes of the Jarilla Mountains.
Sites with Brownware-only assemblages are located in all zones
of the Dana Ana Range.
The hypothesis that ceramic types would
show non-random distributions on McGregor and Dona Ana Ranges has
been validated.
The significance of the observed patterns of
ceramic type distributions will be discussed below as well as at
the end of the section.
THE CORRELATION OF SITE TYPES AND CERAMIC TYPES
It was also hypothesized that different types of sites
would show evidence of differing ceramic assemblages.
The site
typology for Dona Ana Range was devised on the basis of visible
surface remains, which include size of the site, presence of
structures, the type and diversity of artifacts and features.
The number of ceramic types visible was not a criterion for the
placement of a site into a particular site type category, therefore an analysis of ceramic diversity in sites of differing types
may lead to validation of, or doubts about, the meaningfulness
of the site typology.
Another hypothesis which may be proposed
states that more complex sites such as villages show a greater
variety of ceramic types than simpler sites such as camps.
For the following analysis, the ceramic types from Dona Ana
Range are grouped into categories which reflect their area of
origin:
1. Local wares: El Paso Brown and Corrugated, El Paso
Polychrome.
2. Northern Jornada Branch Wares: Chupadero Black on White.
3. Mimbres Branch Wares: Mimbres Classic Black on White,
Seco Corrugated.
4. Northern Tularosa Basin Wares: Three Rivers Red on
Terracotta, San Andres Red on Terracotta.
S. East Central Arizona Wares: White Mountain Redware.
6. Chihuahuan Wares: Playas Redware (all varieties),
Ra~os Polychrome, CorraZitos Polychrome Incised.

No significant difference was found, even when lithic/
ceramic scatters and isolated ceramic scatters were eliminated
from the data.
This could be due to the fact that villages,
large complex camps, complex camps, small camps, and isolated
hearths encompass the same functions.
Alternatively, the
nonsignificance could be due to a small sample size.
By
grouping the data in a 2 by 2 contingency table it is possible
to compare local versus intrusive ceramics to village versus nonvillage site types (Table II-15).

When a chi-square test is performed on the contingency
table the result is that these groups differ beyond the ,01
level of significance.
Villages, therefore, can be differentiated from other site types by the quantity of intrusive types of
ceramics.
BROWNWARE-ONLY SITES
Of the ninty-six survey units covered on this survey, f i~ty­
six contained ceramic sites.
Of these fifty-six survey units,
fifty have one or more sites with only El Paso Brown or a
combination of El Paso Brown and El Paso Polychrome.

CORRELATION OF TYPES

265

Sites with El Paso Brown are either assigned to the
Mesilla Phase (if they show El Paso Brown rims) or classified as
"Indeterminate" Phase if there are only a few body sherds.
Many,
if not most, of these latter sites are probably Mesilla Phase
sites.
Seventy of these El Paso Brown-only sites are found in
thirty-eight survey units on Dona Ana Range.
A look at their
distribution shows that they are well-represented in all parts of
the Range.
Sites with El Paso Brown and El Paso Polychrome are
attributed to the Dona Ana and/or El Paso Phases.
Nineteen of
these sites were located in eighteen survey units.
Although sites
showing this combination of types are no~ as common as the El
Paso Brown-only sites, they are also widely distributed across
Dona Ana Range in all zones.
As stated above, sites showing only El Paso Brown sherds
were found in great abundance in all geographic zones and
represent many different site types.
They probably represent
small villages, camps, and wild plant processing sites of
Mesilla Phase people.
If they are indeed Mesilla Phase sites,
their random distribution would be explained by the generalized
subsistence adaptation that has been postulated for this period
(Whalen 1977).
El Paso Brown/El Paso Polychrome sites are interpreted
differently.
Their placement in the post-A.D. 1100 period is not
doubted, but their lack of any intrusive ceramic types distin~
guishes them from the large, ceramically-diverse village sites of
this period.
Two possibilities are feasible for the interpretation
of these sites.
First of all, they could represent specialfunction sites such as hunting camps or plant collecting and
processing centers from the Dona Ana and/or El Paso Phases.
Secondly, they might represent all types of sites (including
habitation sites) from the Dona Ana Phase, before the advent of
large villages which show many ceramic types.
The distribution of these El Paso Brown/ El Paso Polychromeonly sites appears similar to the distribution of El Paso
Brawn-only sites.
Both were found to be common and randomly
distributed in all the geographic zones sampled; their location
in close proximity to El Paso Phase villages of the lower
alluvial fans suggests that they were not contemporaneous with
El Paso Phase villages.
It seems possible, therefore, that at
least some of the El Paso Brown/El Paso Polychrome sites
predate the El Paso Phase.
An explanation for this would be
that even after El Paso Polychrome was added to El Paso Brown
as the utility ware complex of these people, the same general
subsistence adaptation was followed.
Although this is not a
new interpretation for the sequence of subsistence strategies
(from general, mixed hunting, gathering, and farming, to an
emphasis on farming in particular zones) (Whalen 1977), the
idea that El Paso Brown/El Paso Polychrome-only sites represent
the transition has never before been advanced.
At La Cueva,

CERAMIC ANALYSIS

Lehmer identified a level which contained only El Paso Brown
and El Paso Polychrome (Lehmer 1948: 37).
This rests on a
Mesilla Phase layer of El Paso Brown-only and is superceded
by late Dona Ana Phase material (El Paso Brown, El Paso
Polychrome, Chupadero Black on White, Three Rivers Red on
Terracotta, and Mimbres Classic Black on White).
This information
corroborates the theory that a period of El Paso Brown and
El Paso Polychrome assemblages predated the ceramicallydiverse sites of the late Dona Ana and El Paso Phases.
Later,
when agriculture intensified during the El Paso Phase, El Paso
Polychrome continued to be used, and many other ceramic types
were traded in from other areas of the Southwest.
This is
most likely the period of large villages.
Whalen (1978) has recently begun seriating El Paso
Polychrome rims, dividing them into "Earlier" and "Later"
types.
By studying El Paso Polychrome rims from El Paso Brown/
El Paso Polychrome-only sites according to this seriation, their
placement as "Earlier" or "Later" could conceivably be determined.
Unfortunately, our present collections are not large enough for
this approach.
El Paso Brown and Polychrome commonly accompany any
other ceramics found on a site; only two sites are exceptions.
This fact establishes these two local brownware types as the
basic, all-purpose wares of the area.
Table II-16 presents a cross-tabulation of sites characterized by local brownwares only, and site types.
This is further
subdivided into El Paso Brown-only sites and El Paso Brown/El
Paso Polychrome-only sites.
Presumably the former is mostly a
Mesilla Phase manifestation and the latter represents the Do~a
Ana and/or El Paso Phases.
If one assumes that Mesilla Phase peoples practiced a
generalized subsistence pattern of farming, hunting, and
gathering, Mesilla Phase sites should be relatively small,
simple, and widely scattered.
In fact, these sites are found
in all parts of Dona Ana Range, as has been discussed"8:bove.
An examination of Table II~l6, however, does not show these sites
to be particularly small or simple.
They show up in all site
categories including village complexes.
In fact, except for
villages and isolated ceramic scatters (only one example}, the
percentages of El Paso Brown-only sites in all site categories
ranges between 61 and 74 percent.
Correspondingly, Dona Ana/
El Paso Phase brownware sites in the categories vary between
39 percent and 26 percent.
The site categories were developed
for use on a field survey, and this information suggests that
they probably do not reflect actual site size and complexity,
Excavation would undoubtedly reveal features and artifacts that
would segregate Mesilla Phase sites from the Dona Ana Phase
sites.
On this survey, the only indicator used for phase
designation of a particular site has been ceramic types present.

El Paso Brown and Polychrome-only sites, representing
the Dona Ana and/or El Paso Phases, pose the same dilemma.
They too are evenly distributed in all the various site type
categories except village complexes.
This similarity to Mesilla
Phase El Paso Brown-only sites strengt~ens the idea that
these sites come from the transitional Dona Ana Phase.
There
are not as many of these sites as Mesilla Phase sites, perhaps
because they represent a shorter span of time.
Local brownware-only sites together form a great percentage
of sites in all categories located by TAS on Dona Ana Range.
Only village sites demonstrate consistently more complex
ceramic assemblages.
The fact that other site types are
confusingly similar in their ceramic assemblages indicates that
there is more to be learned about them.
Further investigations
may clarify their differances and similarities, whether these
be functional or temporal.
THE CHRONOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SITES
Up to this point, the dating of sites has been ignored in
examining the distribution of ceramic types.
Table II-13
lists the ceramic data for Dona Ana Range, site by site, and
each site is given one or more phase designations.
In order to
avoid building theories on ;igood guesses", each site was dated
very conservatively on the basis of all that is known on the
absolute dates of particular ceramic types.
In many cases the
kind of sites that have usually been called "El Paso Phase,"
such as large village sites, are herein called "Dona Ana and/or
El Paso Phase" sites in order to stick to ~hat is strictly
known about their chronological placement.
Figure II-7 maps sites chronologically,
It was felt
necessary to generalize site age into "Early," "Late," and
"Indeterminate" because many sites were impossible to date more
exactly.
These designations are explained below:

EARLY SITES -- Early sites are uncommon, only 11 percent

They have been located mostly in the
northeastern part of the Range in the Tularosa Basin Lowlands
zone (see Fig. II~7).
LATE SITES -- These sites, 38 percent of the total, tend
to cluster around the depression of Old Coe Lake, both on the
alluvial fans of the Organ Mountains and in the Tularosa Basin.
They are also found on alluvial fans associated with the
Jarilla Mountains.
Late sites found in other parts of the
Range are of the EZ Paso Brown-EZ Paso Polychrome variety, and
may or may not be contemporaneous with other late sites.

CERAMIC ANALYSIS

El Paso Brownware in only small quantities and it is impossible
to date them; 52 percent of all sites are of this nature.
It
seems likely that many of them date to the Early Period, since
undecorated El Paso Brown was the dominant ware at that time.
They are found in all zones of Dona Ana Range in equal
quantities.
SUMMARY
By examining ceramic sherds collected on this survey of
Dona Ana Range, it has been possible to gain insight into the
settlement patterns of Jornada Branch peoples in the Lower
Tularosa Basin.
Specifically, sherds have provided information
on site chronology and extra-areal contacts.
THE EARLY PERIOD
Early sites (Mesilla Phase) are found in small numbers on
Dona Ana Range, mostly in the northeastern section.
About 10
percent of all sites fall into this category, but many El Paso
Brown-only sites which have been classified as "Indeterminate
Phase" are probably from this period.
These brownware sites are
found in all zones.
The pattern fits Whalen's (1977) theory
that the placement of early sites reflects a generalized subsistence pattern consisting of farming, hunting, and gathering of
wild resources in most environmental zones.
Extra-areal contacts
at this time were minimal, and no Mesilla Phase sites on Dona Ana
Range evidence any intrusive ceramics.
THE LATE PERIOD
The Late Period (Dona Ana and El Paso phases) sees a
growth in the number of sites (38 percent of all sites on Dona
Ana Range).
These sites are concentrated on the lower alluvial
fans of the Organ Mountains and Jarilla Mountain outliers.
These
concentrations are mostly village sites with a high diversity of
ceramic types.
It is apparent that hydrological and perhaps soil
conditions in these areas are favorable for intensive agriculture
and are responsible for the locations of these late village
sites.
Runoff from the Organ and Jarilla mountains is undoubtedly
responsible for the presence of late village sites on the
alluvial fans of Dona Ana Range.
The slight depression of Old
Coe Lake also offered favorable farming conditions for late,
ceramically-diverse village sites.
Late sites which are low in
ceramic diversity (i.e. El Paso Brown/El Paso Polychrome-only
sites) are found in all areas of the Range and may represent
camps contemporaneous with the more complex village sites.
Another interpretation is that they represent the transition
period from an early, generalist subsistence adaptation (with
habitation and processing sites located in all zones} to a later,

CONCLUSIONS

271

agriculturally-specialized adaptation (with a concentration of
sites in hydrologically favorable zones).
Although it is
difficult to distinguish different types of sites on the basis
of how many and which ceramic types are present, village sites
are significantly more complex ceramically than all other kinds
of sites.
These late, complex sites participated intensively
in extra-areal trade and evidence a wide variety of intrusive
ceramics.
Small brownware sites of indeterminable age populate all
areas of Dofia Ana Range.
A reasonable explanation for these
sites is that they are temporary, non-habitation camps and wild
food processing centers for Early Phase people.
CONCLUSIONS
COMPARATIVE DATA
In comparison with the number of ceramic types identified
from sites on McGregor Range (Smiley 1977), relatively few types
were found on Dona Ana Range.
A smaller area was surveyed,
fewer ceramic sites located (173 versus 265), fewer village
complexes identified (10 versus 29), and a smaller sample of
ceramic sherds and artifacts collected (703 versus 21,876).
All
of these factors probably contributed to the smaller list of
ceramic type occurrences.
Evidence from previous efforts in the
area show that many intrusive ceramic types are found only very
sporadically, and usually in large village complexes.
Types not
found on Dona Ana Range but present in the area include~

IDEAS FOR FURTHER WORK
These suggestions are oriented around ceramic studies, and
are divided into field work projects, laboratory projects, and
research project categories.
Field Work
1.
More field work similar to Whalen's (1977) 100 percent
coverage of an area in the Eastern Hueco Bolson would add
immeasurably to the knowledge of Jornada Branch prehistory.
Since the nature and density of sites in the Lower Tularosa
Basin appear to vary according to local geography, it is
desirable to survey and excavate in as many of these areas as
possible.
2.
Late village sites are more attractive to excavators,
but they are the best known site type in this area.
A more
valuable contribution would be to examine the smaller, less
complex sites about which little is known.
Flotation and
palynological studies, in conjunction with traditional excavation
and analytical techniques, could contribute much to functional
interpretations of these sites.
Laboratory Projects
1.
Much more work needs to be done on defining the
differences and similarities between El Paso Brown and El Paso
Polychrome.
This would include studies of vessel form and
mineral constituents.
2.
By comparing rim forms of El Paso Brown from El Paso
Brown-only sites to rim forms from El Paso Brown/El Paso
Polychrome-only sites, it may be possible to determine if these
sites are contemporaneous.
3.
Studies can be made of the geological constituents of
El Paso Polychrome to determine locations of manufacture.
4.
If Mimbres Classic Black on White found in the Tularosa
Basin is analyzed for mineral constituents and compared with
sherds of the same type from the Mimbres Branch and from Mimbres
colonies near the Rio Grande, it should be possible to discover
in which area this type was manufactured for trade.
5.
A similar mineral analysis of Chupadero Black on White
would determine the local/intrusive nature of this type in the
Lower Tularosa Basin.
6.
Comparison of vessel sizes and shapes in rim sh£rds

CONCLUDING REMARKS

273

at a single site would reveal information about the ceramic
assemblages used by one group of people.
Intersite comparisons
could detect differences in vessel assemblages.
A project of
this nature is currently in preparation using the McGregor
Range material (Smiley 1978).
Research Project
1.
In order to effectively date a site by ceramics, not
only must the life span of a particular type be known, but the
history of that type must be understood.
For example, this would
involve knowing when a type was traded into an area and in what
quantity.
Examinations of site reports to compare the occurrence and abundance of ceramic types found in sites of determined
age in the Tularosa Basin would greatly contribute to forming
this essential history.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
In addition to reporting and describing the prehistoric
ceramics collected on Dona Ana Range, this study has obtained
information pertinent to site chronology, extra-areal trade
interaction, and settlement patterning fr-0m the indirect
evidence provided by the survey collection of sherds.
Potsherds
are one of the more powerful tools in the study of archeology
in the Southwest; that potential has barely been tapped.
The small collection of ceramics taken during the course
of this survey is described and summarized in the sections on
"Type Descriptions and Analysis", "Post-Firing Modifications",
and in Table II-13.
The ceramic sampling strategy, which
emphasized the presence or absence of pottery types at sites,
provided evidence in support of Whalen's (1977) theory that the
general adaptation of the Mesilla Phase people gradually shifted
to a more specialized economic pattern by the El Paso Phase.
This can be seen in the geographic distribution of ceramic types
on Dona Ana Range (Fig. II-7!.
Furthermore, sites wnich yield
only EZ Paso Brown and EZ Paso PoZyahrome seem to represent the
transitional period and belong to either the Dona Ana Phase or
the early El Paso Phase.
Careful testing and excavation are
needed to substantiate these findings.
One reason for the Army's utilization of this area is its
lack of economic value.
Inhabitants of the Tularosa Basin in
prehistoric times were limited, much like those of today, by the
aridity and the temperature extremes of tnis desert environment.
Nevertheless, at one time, relatively large populations supported
themselves by farming, hunting, and gathering in this same area.
Evidence of trade indicates that constant contact was maintained
with the core culture area of the Southwest.
One trading partner,
the town of Casas Grandes in Chihuahua, reached a particularly
high level of economic and social development.
The Jornada

Branch people would be more usefully viewed not as "peripheral"
or primitive in comparison with their neighbors in the Southwest, but as sophisticated practitioners of the art of survival
in an extremely arid environment.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This project was carried out with the assistaµce of a
great many people, both on and off Dona Ana Range, and their
assistance is much appreciated.
Grant Hall, Ray Kenmotsu,
Mike Mallouf, Woody Woolrigde .Dan Potter, Walter Adams, and
Dr. David Dibble were all involved in portions of the field
work.
Dr. Dibble, as Principal Investigator, also provided
advice and suggestions on the preparation of this report.
Other kinds of assistance and cooperation were provided by
many of the officers and men of the U.S. Army-Fort Bliss, and
Dona Ana Range in particular.
These included, especially,
Major Pendleton, the Operations Officer for Range Command; Dr.
Glenn DeGarmo, Staff Archeologist for Fort Bliss; Mr. James
Conyers and Mr. Kevin von Finger of the.Environmental Protection
Office; Colonel Ray s. Hansen, Director df Facilities Engineering;
and Sergeant Patrick D .. JUlban~, N.• c.o.r.c. for Dona Ana Range. .
Dr. Rex Gerald and Dr. Michael Whalen, both of the Centennial
Museum in El Paso, provid~d ideas and unpublished information,
and the El Paso Archaeological Society contributed ~heir aid
and information from their files.
Dr. Vic Baker of the University
of Texas at Austin was a valuable source of ad*ic~ on the
geomorphological research in the area.
Solveig Turpin did th~
computer analysis.

Some of the most personally rewarding portions of any
survey are the opportunities to meet and taik with people who
have specific knowledge of an area -- whether that knowledge is
personal, . schQilarJy, or a mixture of .-the two.
The degre~ ot
cooperation experienced in the e<lurse of researching the his.tory
of Dona Ana Range was particularly striking, for, without ex~- - ~
ception, individuals who may otherwise have had every reason to
withhold information shared it graciously.
As a group, the people whose families formerly ranched on
or around Dona Ana Range are surely the most generous and openhearted individuals it has ever bee.n my pleas1Jre to work with.
They include Jim Beasley of the Soledad Canyon family; his
aunt, Iva Clay, and her husband Dewey of Willcox, Arizona, who
provided excellent, consistently accurate information about the
Organ Mountains; Mr. and Mrs. Joe F. Wiegel of Hillsboro, New
Mexico, who untangled the very complicated layout of Globe
Pasture, an area which had been impossible to get to in person;
and W.R. McNew, Jr., of Oracle, Arizona, who didn't mind my
arriving for an interview at 8:00 A.M., and spent the morning
reminiscing about his parents and their ranch at Orogrande.
Pete Atkins and Martin Lewis of the Provost Marshal's
Office were unfailingly interested and helpful, often going
beyond the limits of what was merely suggested, to make introductions and carry me around the Range.
They smoothed the way to
a meeting with Tom Dayberry at White Sands.
Dayberry, in turn,

369

introduced me to his uncle, Hal Cox, who despite his initial
recalcitrance, parted with a fair amount of excellent information
about his family and the history of the Cox Ranch.
In El Paso, George Schneider spent large amounts of time
describing his family's mining endeavors in Texas Canyon.
He
also loaned invaluable maps and documents pertaining to mining
throughout the Organ Mountains.
My first contact with Schneider
was made through yet another helpful member of the Army,
Sergeant Patrick Kilbane, who was not only a knowledgeable informant, but an excellent guide as well.
In the Las Cruces and El Paso areas, at least four other
individuals who had personal memories of· earlier times on Dona
Ana Range helped out.
Mrs. Albert Elmer Coe, daughter-in-law
of Mary Coe Blevins, showed me phntographs and described her
impressions of Mrs. Blevins as a personality as well as a rancher.
Mrs. Opal Cotner, a daughter of Mrs. Blevins, gave me copies of
two autobiographical articles her mother had written, and
shared her carefully - researched genealogical notes.
Irving
("Jim") Arnold, who worked for George Blevins, provided information
about work on the Coe Ranch as well as specifics about the Coe
home place and Scott Tank.
In Austin, C.T. "Charley" Webber
described the area around the Coe Ranch, and spoke about cavalry
units of which he was a member after World War I.
A second group of individuals-~rtd £nstitutions must be
recognized for their spirit of cooperation.
In Austin, the staffs
of the Barker Texas History Center, The University of Texas,
have consistently gone beyond the call of duty and have never
failed to answer any question or request.
The staff of the
genealogy division of the Texas State Library has been similarly
helpful, as have employees of The University of Texas at Austin
Interlibrary Loan and Documents services.
In El Paso, librarians in the Southwestern Collection of the
Public Library opened their files and provided excellent assistance, as did Bud Newman and John Ahouse of the Archives, The
University of Texas at El Paso.
Newman, in particular, offered
helpful suggestions, and made available several collections
I would not otherwise have been able to use.
On Fort Bliss
itself, Kevin von Finger of the Environmental Office provided
maps and feedback in our discussions of certain aspects of
rainfall, vegetation, and early historic use of the Range. E.
Portillo in Engineeripg aided in tracing early acquisition of
Dona Ana, as did John R. Cobb, who was involved in documenting
the government's ownership and use of the property.
The staff
of the USAADS Library at Fort Bliss provided research materials
and some free xeroxing.
Probably the most extensive collections pertaining to the
Dona Ana area reside in the Rio Grande Historical Collections of
New Mexico State University, Las Cruces.
There, Director Austin
Hoover has done an admirable job of locating documents, photographs, and tapes.
Other very helpful agencies in the area
included the Dona Ana County Clerk's office, and the Las Cruces

370

office of the Bureau of Land Management, where employees pulled
township map files pertaining to Dona Ana Range.
Finally, a
specific word of thanks must go to owners of the Southwestern
Abstract & Title Company who opened their abstract files, thereby
saving me enormous amounts of time in searching out the particulars
of land ownership on Dona Ana Range.
In Santa Fe, the staffs of the State Records Center and
Archives, the State Library, the library at the Laboratory of
Anthropology, and the Bureau of Land Management all made materials
available without which this paper could not have been written.
I would especially like to thank Fred Waskowiak of the Bureau
of Land Management, who made a long distance call to Washington,
D.C., in an attempt to clear up confusions concerning early Doiia
Ana homesteaders.
Other institutions and individuals who helped in more-or-less
specific ways included the staffs of the Lincoln, Otero, and El
Paso county courthouses; J. Evetts Haley, who surveyed his
collections for information and made a number of helpful suggestions; Gary L. Morgan of the Cartographic Archives Division, the
National Archives and Records Service, Washington, D.C., who
search~d map files and unearthed unpublished maps from the
Wheeler Survey; Robert H. Becker of The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, who made available some interesting
San Augustine interview material dating from the 1880's; the
clerks of Gray and Roberts counties, Texas; the VA Hospital,
Albuquerque, and Sam W. Raley of Lordsburg, New Mexico, who aided
in the search for possible descendents of the Moody Brothers;
personnel at White Sands National Monument who allowed me to use
their files and shared their excellent tapes of early-day
ranchers; and the staff of the Archives Division, PanhandlePlains Museum, Canyon, Texas.
I would also like to thank Ruth
and Allen Killam of El Paso for their excellent hospitality;
Marsha Jackson for the same in Santa Fe; and my husband, Joe
Freeman, who contributed photographs, drawings, and measurements
of historic sites on Doiia Ana Range.
Thanks, also, to David M.
Jones of the Institute of· Archaeology, the University of London,
who spent an afternoon at the Institute, showing me examples of
what he had accomplished in plotting historic ranch ruins using
high altitude photography and computers.
Finally, there are several individuals who are "amateurs" in
the best sense of the word.
Goethe has written that an amateur,
if he is truly an amatoP -- a lover of what he does -- unfailingly
performs better than the professional going by rules.
Herman
Weisner, Robert N. Mullin, and Leslie Davis have all made their
livelihoods at something other than the study of history, but
the word "professional" is hardly strong enough to describe the
excellent work they have accomplished over a period of many years.
Curious, diligent, and meticulous, they have all the best instincts, and their work -- such as that done by Davis at Coe Lake,
Mullin on Pat Garrett, and Weisner on Lincoln County -- stands
with, and frequently surpasses, the best by "professional"
historians.
My thanks to all three for their help and contributions.

371

The preparation of this report also involved the skills of
a number of people.
The editors would like to thank Terry
Bement and Deborah Smith who typed the manuscript, Jack Grieder
who did the photo printing, and Peter Sprouse and Sandy Hannum
who drafted the maps and figures.
