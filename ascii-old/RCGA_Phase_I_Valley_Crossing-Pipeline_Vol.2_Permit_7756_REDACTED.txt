ABSTRACT
This report provides the results of Phase I submerged cultural resources remote sensing
investigations to support Valley Crossing Pipeline, LLC’s Valley Crossing Pipeline Project (the Pipeline
or the Project). This is the second volume in a series that documents the intensive onshore and offshore
cultural resources surveys conducted in support of permitting and compliance requirements for the
proposed Project. The Pipeline is designed to deliver up to 2.6 Billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural
gas produced in the State of Texas to the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) at a proposed
interconnection at the International Boundary with an unaffiliated third-party pipeline to be constructed
by Infraestructura Marina del Golfo, S. de R.L. de C.V. (Marina). The Project will provide transportation
of natural gas from a compressor station near Agua Dulce in Nueces County, Texas, to a tie-in point with
the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan Pipeline in offshore waters on the International Boundary between the United
States and Mexico approximately 9 nautical miles (nm) off the Texas coast near Brownsville, Texas. The
offshore portion of the proposed 42-inch diameter Pipeline is approximately 14 linear miles in length
from the pipe’s beach crossing where it enters the Gulf of Mexico via a Direct Pipe® installation under
the shoreline to the tie-in point on the U.S.-Mexico border. R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.
conducted this study pursuant to the Antiquities Code of Texas and the Texas Administrative Code (TAC)
under Permit No. 7756, and under the Texas General Land Office’s (GLO) Authorization No. 15-0028.
Marine geophysical and geotechnical surveys of the offshore portion of the Project were
conducted by Fugro Geoservices, Inc. (Fugro) and John Chance Land Surveys, Inc. (JCLS). RCG&A
participated in these field surveys and subsequently conducted an archaeological assessment of the
offshore Project area corridor, which is located entirely in Texas state waters. It has an area footprint of
716.17 acres (289.8 hectares). From September 15 to October 18, 2016, marine geophysical survey of
this corridor acquired approximately 1,223 linear nautical miles (2,265 kilometers) of data. A
geotechnical program (Vibracore and box cores) also was conducted by Fugro between October 28 and
November 1, 2016, to ground truth the previously collected geophysical survey data.
This work was performed to assist Valley Crossing Pipeline, LLC, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), with survey and inventory of
cultural resources and with consideration of the Project’s effects on historic properties in the offshore
corridor. The work was conducted pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 (NHPA), as amended, and its implementing regulations 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800,

ii

entitled “Protection of Historic Properties.” The work also was performed in accordance with the
Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974; the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987 (43 U.S.C.
2101-2106); Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and 800, as appropriate; and with
standards set forth in Archeology and Historic Preservation: the Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines.
The work also followed guidelines contained within Preservation Connection: Texas’ Statewide Historic
Preservation Plan 2011-2020, and applied information provided by the Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) and the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory.
As a result of these investigations, no targets indicative of submerged cultural resource resources
were noted within the 300 ft-wide offshore centerline study corridor. However, two targets – both
confirmed shipwrecks – were recorded outside of the centerline study corridor, one within the larger
anchor corridor area of potential impact by anchor handling and anchor chain sweeps (Target DW-001),
and one (Target SW-001), in the surf zone between 75-100 feet (22.8-30.5 meters) above the location of a
planned Direct Pipe® (HDD) installation. Target SW-001 appears to represent the remains of the
wrecked fishing vessel Campesino. Target DW-001, 1,340 feet (408.4 meters) north of the pipeline
centerline (Station 52,154.00), is associated with charted wreck 9328 (NOAA 2016), a disarticulated
shrimp boat. Target BSP-001 was observed in the magnetometer data; however, it lies outside of the
6,000 ft (APE) adjacent to the Brazos Santiago Pass Fairway. That target, which consists of complex
magnetic anomalies, exhibits the characteristics of a submerged/buried cultural resource. Target BSP-001
is 233 feet (71.0 meters) away from the maximum boundary of anchor drops and anchor cable sweeps.
The geotechnical survey data demonstrated that no buried paleo-features with the possibility for
cultural resource preservation were recorded within the Area of Potential Effect (APE). Target SW-001
will be avoided by a directional drill. Target DW-001 will be avoided by a buffer distance approved by
TX SHPO. Therefore, none of these three resources will be affected by the planned undertaking and
emplacement of the Valley Crossing Pipeline. A determination of “No historic properties affected” (36
CFR 800.4) is recommended.
Project records will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), J.J.
Pickle Research Campus, Building 5, The University of Texas at Austin, 10100 Burnet Road, Austin,
Texas 79758.

for this project, and he participated in all deep water geophysical survey work. R. Christopher Goodwin &
Associates, Inc. (RCG&A) is responsible for completion of the onshore and offshore cultural resources
investigations for the Project survey corridor and ancillary items on behalf of Valley Crossing Pipeline,
LLC (Valley Crossing), a subsidiary of Enbridge Inc.
The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), under authority of Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, is the lead federal agency in onshore
areas, including and water bodies, and offshore areas not in immediate proximity to the International
Boundary; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has jurisdiction under the Natural Gas
Act, its regulations, and various Executive Orders for border-crossing facilities, and is the lead federal
agency for the proposed project at the International Boundary. All archaeological work was performed
pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, and its implementing
regulations contained in 36 CFR Part 800 entitled “Protection of Historic Properties.” The work also was
conducted in accordance with the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974; Title 36 of the
Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and 800, as appropriate; the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act of
1987 (43 U.S.C. 2101-2106); and with standards set forth in the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and
Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation (48 FR 44738-44739). In addition, the work was
governed by the Antiquities Code of Texas and the Texas Administrative Code (Title 13). Finally, Valley
Crossing applied to the FERC for a Presidential Permit in accordance with Executive Order 11423, as
amended, for the U.S.-Mexico border crossing.

PROJECT LOCATION
Valley Crossing Pipeline, LLC will be constructing approximately 167.5 miles of 42-inch and 48inch diameter pipeline, to provide natural gas to the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) for use in
natural gas-fired electric generation plants. The Project includes the transportation of natural gas from a
header system in Nueces County, Texas, near the Agua Dulce Hub (the Nueces Header), and related
facilities, all of which will be located entirely within the state of Texas (the Valley Crossing Pipeline).
The Valley Crossing Pipeline will be an intrastate transmission system, with its construction and
operation regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas. Its principal business will be the transportation
of natural gas to and from points on the Nueces Header, with pipeline service extending from the Nueces
Header through five Texas counties in the USACE Galveston District to a to a tie-in point with the Sur de
Texas-Tuxpan Pipeline on the International Boundary between the United States and Mexico in offshore
waters approximately nine nautical miles (nm) off the Texas coast near Brownsville, Texas.
The proposed Project initiates in Nueces County, Texas, approximately 0.2 miles southeast of the
Farm-to-Market (FM) 666 and FM 2826 intersection. The proposed alignment proceeds in a south to

4

southeasterly direction for approximately 9 miles where it crosses U.S. 77, then continues east of U.S. 77
in a south to south-westerly direction for approximately 28 miles until it crosses U.S. 77 near Sarita, in
Kenedy County, Texas. The proposed alignment continues on the western side of U.S. 77 for
approximately 46 miles until it crosses U.S. 77 to the east side at about MP 85.7, approximately 4 miles
north of Raymondville in Willacy County, Texas.
From this point the proposed route proceeds in a south to south-easterly direction for
approximately 52 miles until it reaches State Highway (SH) 48 located just north of the Brazos Island
Harbor Channel in Cameron County at MP 139.76. The alignment continues along the north side of SH
48 for approximately 1.5 miles before crossing to the south side of SH 48 for approximately 5 miles until
it turns in a south-easterly direction to cross the Brownsville Ship Channel. Once the alignment crosses
the channel it turns east and is parallel to the south side of Port of Brownsville dredge spoil piles. A
horizontal directional drill (HDD) is required to cross the mouth of South Bay prior to crossing Clark
Island. Once offshore, the Project alignment continues in a south-easterly direction for approximately 14
miles until it reaches a tie-in with a proposed pipeline originating in Mexico (Figure I-2). The permitted
archeological investigations for onshore state-owned parcels in Cameron County, Texas were conducted
in accordance with Texas Antiquities Archeology Permit No. 7937. Archeological survey (onshore) on
Texas GLO property was conducted in accordance with a No-collection permit document, TX-CA274.007 (McLean et al. 2017).

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AREA
The offshore portion of the Valley Crossing project is a broad S-shaped study area that originates
at a pipeline Direct Pipe® entry point at Foot Post (Station) 0+00 on Brazos Island (old Clark Island) in
Cameron County, Texas (Figure I-2). The 42-inch diameter pipe will be installed using the Direct Pipe®
method underneath the shoreline sand dune, exiting offshore at Station 50+0. The offshore pipeline
corridor encompasses a 300-ft wide centerline study corridor and up to a 3,000-ft wide anchor corridor
either side of centerline. It traverses a southeasterly course until approximately Station 80+00, where it
begins to curve southerly and follows a course roughly parallel to the Brazos Island shoreline, then turns
gulf ward at Station 270+00, offshore Boca Chica Beach. The pipeline corridor continues along an
easterly offshore path to a tie-in point (Station 753+58.88) with the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan Pipeline on the
International Boundary between the United States and Mexico, approximately 10.4 miles (9 nautical
miles) offshore Brownsville, Texas.
This report describes the methods used to acquire high resolution geophysical data and to perform
submerged cultural resource assessment of the offshore portion of the Valley Pipeline corridor. Valley
Crossing subcontracted Fugro Geoservices, Inc. (Fugro) to collect survey data from the seafloor within a

5

centerline study corridor and adjacent anchor handling corridors to finalize a pipeline route that
minimized impacts to submerged cultural resources, and to develop protocols to avoid any such
submerged cultural resources within the anchor handling areas. The submerged cultural resources surveys
and the geophysical and geotechnical investigations complied with Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC), State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) standards and guidelines (Texas Administrative Code,
Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 28, Rule 28.6). As shown in Figure I-1, the pipeline exits a Direct Pipe®
borehole in approximately 16 ft (4.9 m) water depth and terminates at the U.S.-Mexico border in
approximately 89 ft (27.1 m) water depth. The project area encompasses a 6,000 ft (1,828.8 m) wide
corridor, 3,000 ft (914.4 m) either side of the planned pipeline centerline. This report references station
numbers to maintain continuity with Fugro Geoservices, Inc. (Fugro) operations and hazard reports
(Fugro 2016a, 2016b).

STUDY AREA CONTEXT
Prior to conducting geophysical survey, an archival and documentary review was undertaken to
develop a cultural context for the project area to enable characterization of the number and range of
offshore cultural resources that might be present, and to develop a baseline against which the significance
of any such resources could be evaluated applying the National Register of Historic Places Criteria for
Evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). Situated offshore of Brownsville, TX, the project makes landfall near
Clark Island; therefore, the historic exploration, settlement, and development of the lower Texas Gulf
Coast provides an important context for understanding the maritime developments that characterized use
of the project area during the past.
The study region possesses high potential for cultural resources from both the prehistoric and
historic past. Low sea level stands of the late Pleistocene were approximately 390 ft (120 m) below
present level and may have provided a now submerged sub-aerially exposed landscape for early, i.e., preClovis Paleoindian activity before sea level rose after 14,000 ybp. During later Prehistory, prehistoric
occupation of this area is known to have increased somewhat steadily and then dramatically, although the
shoreline had receded substantially during the intervening millennia following Pleistocene low sea level
stands. The potential for preservation of drowned terrestrial prehistoric sites is discussed in detail in
Chapter II. Subsequent Spanish expeditions brought European influences to the area, influences that
began to have profound effects with the establishment of permanent settlements during the mideighteenth century. As European presence increased, the region experienced substantial growth in both
settlement and maritime activity. The lower Texas Gulf Coast was and remains a major thoroughfare for
vessel traffic in the Gulf of Mexico. The cultural contexts for this region are described in Chapter IV.

PROJECT SCHEDULE
Valley Crossing initiated the Hazards Survey upon issuance of Texas Antiquities Permit No.
7756. Valley Crossing conducted 24-hour-per-day survey operations. John Chance Land Surveys, Inc.
(JCLS) performed the shallow geophysical vessel operations (<20 ft (6.1 m) depth) on October 4 and 5,
2016, from the Freedom Surveyor, a 24-ft. shallow draft vessel (Fugro 2016a). Fugro Geoservices, Inc.
(Fugro) performed deeper water (>20 ft (6.1 m) depth) geophysical investigations from September 15,
2016, to October 18, 2016 (Fugro 2016b) from the Fugro M/V Fugro Enterprise.
In accordance with best practices, Phase III geotechnical activities did not commence until the
project team, including the QMA, reviewed the relevant survey data and confirmed that there were no
potentially sensitive cultural resources (i.e., shipwrecks, paleo-landscapes) at each sampling site. The
geotechnical investigation was performed from October 28 to November 1, 2016, using M/V Fugro
Americas.

IMPACT OF PROPOSED OFFSHORE PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION
The Valley Crossing Pipeline will be fabricated and laid on the seafloor using a pipe lay barge.
New 42-inch diameter steel pipe will be concrete-coated for negative buoyancy control before
installation. During installation, the anchor handling corridor may measure up to 3,000 ft on either side of
the centerline for a maximum potential impact width of 6,000 ft. The pipeline then will be buried by
jetting using high pressure water and air eductors to create a trench directly under the pipeline by
emulsifying the soils and temporarily dispersing the trench spoil into the water column. The final cover,
i.e., the distance between the top of the pipeline and the natural seabed, will be at least 3 ft (0.9 m),
resulting in a total trench depth of at least 7.5 ft (2.3 m). The trench width will be dependent upon the soil
characteristics and will be determined by the geotechnical investigation results.

AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECT
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is the “geographic area or areas within which an undertaking
may directly or indirectly cause changes in the character of or use of historic properties, if any such
properties exist” (36 C.F.R. § 800.16(d)). The APE for archeological resources includes all areas where
the seabed may be disturbed.
The geographic extent of the APE encompasses a 100-ft wide centerline located with the 300-ft
wide study corridor, with an anchor handling corridor up to 3,000-ft on either side of the centerline. The
vertical APE within the centerline corridor is the maximum trench depth of 9 ft (2.7 m) below seabed to
allow for over-jetting. Thus, the vertical impact is expected to be confined to shallow, near-surface
sediments.

CHAPTER II

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
SOUTH TEXAS COASTAL ZONE AND INNER CONTINENTAL SHELF
Introduction
The Valley Crossing Pipeline will be emplaced along the coast/inner continental shelf along south
Texas (Figure I-1). The project area consists of a ~1 nm wide corridor trending ~5 nm southward along
Brazos Island, where it turns eastward and trends ~8 nm offshore. Its southern extension is defined by the
Texas-Mexico border. This chapter describes the natural setting of the project area as it pertains to
archaeology, and the preservation potential for drowned terrestrial sites in the stratigraphic record of the
area. The chapter begins with a general environmental overview of south Texas, including the proposed
project area, followed by discussion of its physiography and general geology. The geologic developments,
including geologic processes, then are reviewed. Finally, the archaeological implications of that geologic
history are discussed. Given the relative paucity of scientific research along this stretch of the Texas Gulf
coast (Holmes 2011), some of the information below is more regional in nature.
Environmental Overview
The Texas coastal zone is composed of several environments including fluvial-deltaic; barrierstrandplain; bay-estuary-lagoon systems; an eolian (wind) system along the arid southern region; and, a
well-developed marsh-swamp system in the more humid central and northern sections (Brown et al.
1976). The south Texas coastline, including the project area, is a barrier island dominated coastline. The
inland areas consist of relatively flat coastal prairies, chaparral pastureland, and farmland (Brown et al.
1976). Barrier islands are separated from the mainland coast by a series of bays (Brown et al. 1976).
Brazos Island and South Bay represent the landward boundary of the project area.
Climate
The climatology of the western Gulf region is complex, and there are several major and
distinctive climatic zones. The project area along the south Texas coast is considered subtropical and
semi-arid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. Average annual rainfall ranges from 16 to 35

9

inches, occurring mostly during the spring and fall. Rainfall tends to decrease southward, where more arid
conditions prevail. Drought conditions are frequent during the summer. Temperatures are variable
seasonally, and diurnal offshore and onshore breezes act to moderate temperatures in the immediate
coastal zone (Britton and Morton 1989). Winds are predominantly southeastward especially during the
summer months, but switch to the north following the passage of cold fronts during winter months (Weise
and White 1980). Winds have major effects on patterns of erosion and deposition along the coastline.
The western Gulf coast has been impacted by a substantial number of hurricanes. The effects of
17th, 18th, and even 19th century hurricanes generally were not well documented because so few people
lived in this area. However, it is estimated that at least 85 storms have affected the western Gulf coast
since 1880, an average of one tropical cyclone per year (Morton et al. 1983). Tropical storms and
hurricanes can be very effective mechanisms for bottom sediment redistribution, and therefore strongly
influence the preservation potential of cultural materials.
Biology
Water column biota along the Texas Gulf coastal zone and inner shelf can be divided into
plankton and nekton. Plankton is distributed in patches of various sizes, which move with the prevailing
winds and currents. Other factors, such as availability of nutrients and grazing pressure, affect the size
and distribution of the patches. In general, planktonic species diversity decreases with decreased salinity,
whereas biomass decreases with distance from shore. Nekton is represented by marine mammals, reptiles,
fishes, cephalopod mollusks, and crustaceans. Individuals commonly range over broad areas, but most are
limited to geographical and vertical ranges by the same environmental restrictions as less mobile forms
(e.g., temperature, salinity, food availability) (Rouse et al. 1987).
The benthic community contains both floral and faunal components. The floral component
includes algae and sea grasses. The abundance of benthic algae is limited by the scarcity of suitable rocky
substrates and light penetration, but algae have been reported on some of the submarine banks (Rezak et
al. 1983). In some exceptionally clear waters, benthic algae, especially the coralline red algae, have been
found in >492 ft (>150 m) water depths (Rouse et al. 1987). Benthic fauna include the infauna (primarily
burrowing worms and mollusks), and epifauna (primarily mollusks, crustaceans, hydroids, sponges, and
echinoderms). The distribution of benthic fauna correlates well with physical factors. Substrate is the
most important single factor, followed by temperature and salinity. Other less important factors include
illumination, exposure to air, nutrient availability, currents, tides, and wave energy (Rouse et al. 1987).
The benthic community occupying topographic features in the Gulf waters off east Texas appears to be
depth related; however, the primary limiting factors are considered to be temperature and light penetration
(i.e. turbidity and sedimentation) (Rouse et al. 1987).

Physical Oceanography
The Gulf of Mexico is a subtropical sea with an approximate area of 617,763.5 mi2 (1,600,000
km2). The Gulf is unique among the world’s Mediterranean-type seas because it has two entrances: the
Yucatan Strait and the Straits of Florida. It also contains a portion of the Gulf Stream system, known as
the Loop Current, which can influence the entire Gulf. The Loop Current is a highly variable feature; it
enters the Gulf through the Yucatan Strait, and exits through the Straits of Florida. After heading north, it
loops to the east going as far north as the Mississippi-Alabama shelf, and then heads south at the
approximate position of the west Florida shelf break before it exits through the Florida Straits. The major
impacts of the Loop Current occur on the outer shelf, slope, and abyssal areas off Mississippi, Alabama,
and Florida. However, Loop Current eddies with diameters on the order of 186-249 mi (300-400 km)
periodically spin off and move westward into the western Gulf of Mexico, influencing a region between
25o and 28oN (Rouse et al. 1987), which includes the project area.
Current regimes on the outer shelf and slope result from a balance between the influence of open
Gulf circulation features, such as the Loop Current and associated eddies, and shelf circulation proper,
which is dominated by long term wind forcing. When the Loop Current impinges onto the Florida slope
and shelf, a current structure acts to upwell nutrient-rich water from deeper zones, a mechanism that also
may take place as eddies spin off and move along the Louisiana-Texas slope. This accounts for the
increased biological productivity observed in these areas.
Longshore currents consisting of tidal and wind-driven components predominate within a narrow
band close to the coast. Typical maximum tidal currents are on the order of six inches/second (15
cm/second), with tidal excursions of 1.2-1.8 mi (2-3 km). Longshore currents produced by winter
northers, tropical storms, and hurricanes may range up to several knots, depending on local topography,
fetch, and wind duration. Waves in this part of the Gulf of Mexico tend to be smaller than those in the
eastern Gulf, averaging 6.5-9.8 ft (2-3 m) in height, but intensifying during the winter (Rouse et al. 1987).
Physiography and General Geology
The project area resides on the northern structural rim of the Gulf margin, which is composed of
deformed Paleozoic rocks exposed in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma, and occupying
the subsurface from central Mississippi to southwestern Texas (Martin and Bouma 1978). Much of the
modern coast and shelf is underlain by coalescing deltas deposited during Late Pleistocene sea-level
highstands (Bernard and LeBlanc 1965). Immediately underlying the modern environments are sediments
of the Ingleside strandline of the west-central Texas coast, consisting of strike-aligned sand bodies
deposited during the late Pleistocene under wave-dominated marine conditions (Morton and Price 1987).

11

Sediments of the Ingleside consist of sand and shelly sand intercalated with mud, overlying a sandy clay.
It is believed to have formed contemporaneously with deltaic deposition during a sea-level highstand.
The modern coastal plain along the central and southern Texas Gulf coast is gently inclined
gulfward at about 3-5 ft/mi (0.9-1.5 m/mi) (Brown et al. 1976). Valleys cut by rivers provide from 20-50
ft (6-15 m) of relief locally along the coastward sloping land surface. Remnants of the ancestral courses of
river systems occur locally and generally display less than 5 ft (1.5 m) of local topographic relief. Bays
and associated water bodies are generally less than 6 feet deep (Brown et al. 1976). The barrier islands
have a maximum elevation of approximately 45 ft (13.7 m) above mean sea level, but most of the islands
are less than 20 ft (6 m) above mean sea level. The highest points of the islands occur along dune ridges;
the nearest equivalent elevations occur up to 25 mi (40 km) inland (Weise and White 1980). These
elevations owe their origin to the prevailing southeasterly winds from the Gulf of Mexico that act to
concentrate beach sand into large active dunes (Weise and White 1980).
Seaward of the barrier islands, the sea floor slopes gulfward at about 32 feet/mile up to about 20
ft (6 m) water depth, and about 21 ft/mi (6.4 m/mi) from 20-30 feet (6-9.1 m) water depth, and finally
about 6 ft/mi (1.8 m) from 30-50 ft (9.1-15.2m) water depths (Brown et al. 1976). The shelf surface is
generally smooth but locally marked by subdued topographic features such as stream channels, lagoons,
and barrier beaches formed during periods of lower sea level (Martin and Bouma 1978).
Geologic Development
Structural Framework and Early Evolution
The continental margin of the northern and western Gulf of Mexico includes many of the features
common to tectonically inactive, or “Atlantic type” margins (Martin and Bouma 1978). Internally, the
margin consists of a vast accumulation of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments deposited in a relatively
stable tectonic environment. However, the margin has been continually subsiding due to rapid
accumulation of terrigenous clastic sediments. Minor structural features such as salt diapers,
syndepositional gravity faults, shale uplifts, and large-scale slumps constitute the principle deformational
features in this geologically young sedimentary deposit (Martin and Bouma 1978).
As noted above, the northern structural rim of the Gulf margin is composed of heavily deformed
Paleozoic rocks that are exposed in the Ouachita Mountain Belt in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and
identified in the subsurface from central Mississippi to southwestern Texas (Martin and Bouma 1978).
The Ouachita Mountain Belt was formed in Pennsylvanian time by folding due to compressional stresses
that intensely deformed previously deposited deep marine strata, subsequently thrusting them
northwestward over adjacent continental shelf and coastal deposits (Martin and Bouma 1978). Other
major structural elements within the northern Gulf margin include a series of arches, which represent

12

broad areas of differential sedimentation and subsidence with no evidence of vertical uplift (Martin and
Bouma 1978). Substantial crustal subsidence between these relatively stable arches has allowed the
accumulation of great thicknesses of clastic sediments (Martin and Bouma 1978).
Salt diapers are common structural features in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Their evolution is
directly related to loading by sediment accumulation and initiated by the vast input of sediments in the
Gulf Coast Basin (Martin 1977). Sediment loading mobilizes salt and forces it to move vertically upward
forming features known as “salt diapers,” “salt domes,” or “piercement structures.” These features are
thought to be directly related to faulting. Shale structures form in a similar manner, and are more common
in the western and southern portions of the Texas continental margin (Martin and Bouma 1978); they
likely have had a greater influence on the project area.
Recent Geologic Development and Modern Configuration
The numerous glacio-eustatic sea-level fluctuations of the late-Quaternary have produced several
depositional sequences on the Texas inner continental shelf. Depositional sequences are separated by
unconformities caused by regional erosion during sea-level lowstands, but are modified by shoreface
erosion during ensuing sea-level transgressions (Suter et al. 1987). Shoreface erosion forms what is
known as a “ravinement surface” that may erode directly into lowstand deposits. In cases where erosion is
deep enough, the ravinement surface may coincide with the regional lowstand unconformity to form a
single surface. Separation of these two erosional surfaces may occur in valley fill sequences, where the
base of the channel scour represents the lowstand unconformity, and the truncated top of the channel fill
represents the ravinement surface (Suter et al. 1987). As will be discussed later, these preserved channel
fill sediments have the potential to contain cultural materials.
Sequences formed by glacio-eustatic sea-level fluctuations are characterized by sea-level fall
close to or beyond the shelf margin, which causes prolonged subaerial exposure of the shelf resulting in
drainage networks covering significant portions of the shelf. This fluvial erosion creates what are known
as incised valleys, which have been described as the dominant late-Quaternary features on the east Texas
continental shelf. Incision and infilling of these valleys is likely to have occurred during more than one
glacio-eustatic cycle (Anderson et al. 1992). Upon sea-level rise, transgression results in the aggradation
of the coastal plain and filling of the incised valleys (Suter et al. 1987). Much of the deposition within the
valleys may have been a response to increased runoff and sediment loading from early post-glacial
melting and erosion of glacial deposits.
The coastal zone in the project area is underlain by river, delta, and shoreline sediments initially
deposited more than 30,000 years ago during one or more of the Pleistocene interglacial periods. During
these periods, river fed deltas built seaward across marine embayments. A relict shoreline deposit lies

13

along the mainland shore of Laguna Madre marking the position of the most recent Pleistocene shoreline
in south Texas. As sea level began to decline approximately 30,000 years ago, in response to continental
glaciation, erosion of deep valleys by the ancestral Rio Grande River began (Holmes 1971). When sea
level reached its lowest point, approximately 20,000 years ago, the Rio Grande River flowed through
deep valleys across what is now the continental shelf to a shoreline situated many miles gulfward of the
present shoreline. Sediment laden meltwaters produced by the waning glaciers built the massive Rio
Grande Delta, the remnants of which underly the continental shelf in the project area (Holmes 1971).
During the ensuing Holocene sea-level rise, beginning ~20,000 ybp, the ancestral Rio Grande
River Valley that extended across the continental shelf began to infill slowly, first with estuarine
sediments and finally with marine sediments. Seismic data collected from the ancestral Rio Grande Delta
has stratigraphy interpreted to include gas derived from organic material in sediments likely representing
a buried, late Pleistocene marsh associated with the delta (Holmes 2011). From about 14,000 to 12,500
ybp, sea level rose rapidly, which reduced the amount of sediment input to the Rio Grande River and the
delta initially became wave dominated. Continued rapid sea-level rise and decreased sediment supply
eventually led to the cessation of delta building, planing of the shelf and filling of the fluvial valleys
(Berryhill et al. 1987). From ~12,500 to 10,500 ybp, sea level receded briefly ~10 m in response to the
Younger-Dryas event, again decreasing sediment input and allowing a flux of warmer Caribbean waters
into the Gulf of Mexico, which created conditions conducive for shelf edge reef growth (Wiseman and
Dinnel 1988). Sea level continued to rise throughout the Holocene, although the rate slowed to the point
that barrier islands, including ancestral Padre Island, began to form ~6,000 ybp (Holmes 2011). Processes
associated with the transgressing sea reworked ancestral Rio Grande Delta sediments and fluvial valleys
continued to be filled.
Sea level reached its approximate present position in this part of the Gulf of Mexico between
~3,000 and 2,500 years ago, marking the end of Holocene sea-level rise and the beginning of the modern
geological processes that continue to shape the present Texas coastline. Modern coastal processes have
partly filled the bays and estuaries with sediment supplied by rivers, tidal currents, and wave erosion.
Likewise, small barrier islands began to develop in the area of modern Padre Island and Mustang Island to
the north. Small islands coalesced by spit accretion and by infilling of tidal passes to form the modern
east Texas barrier island system. Except for a few tidal passes, the bay-estuarine-lagoon system became
isolated from the open Gulf of Mexico. The initial accretion of modern barrier islands has shifted in some
areas towards erosion because of a net deficiency of sand. Salt marshes, wind-tidal flats, and shallow
marine grass flats have developed in areas where bays, estuaries, and lagoons have infilled to the point of
almost becoming emergent. Eolian (wind) processes have modified both Pleistocene and modern
shoreline sand deposits to form the modern configuration. Once the modern barrier island system had

14

emerged, the wind, in conjunction with waves and currents, began reworking and reshaping the barrier
island sands. These forces continue to rework coastal and nearshore sediments today, with most activity
occurring during major storms (Weise and White 1980).
Perhaps the most effective mechanism for transporting sediment and shaping the central and
southern Texas coastline is the longshore current produced by waves approaching the shoreline at an
oblique angle. Depending upon the size of the waves and the angle of wave approach, longshore currents
at times may be relatively strong and therefore capable of eroding and transporting large quantities of
sediment. The unique nature of the Texas Gulf coastline also comes into play. The shoreline along this
coast is curved so that the upper coast is oriented northeast to southwest, and the lower coast is oriented
northwest to southeast (Figure II-1). Because of this curvature, waves approaching the shore from any
specific direction will be parallel to only one relatively short segment of the beach. Along the shoreline at
either end of the segment, waves approach at an angle so that the resulting longshore currents will flow
towards each other (Figure II-1). The zone of convergence, or the area in which the opposing currents
eventually meet, occurs at approximately 27o N latitude (Brown et al. 1976). This is also the area that
experiences the most net sediment accumulation from the deposition of sand and shells from throughout
the entire system (Komar 1998). Conversely, areas to the north and south would be expected to
experience the most net erosion (Weise and White 1980).
The modern continental shelf off south Texas is gently sloping with a seaward gradient of 9.2
ft/mi (2.8 m/km). A series of small carbonate reefs have been discovered in 223-262 ft (68-80 m) of water
that rise as much as 49 ft (15 m) above the surrounding seafloor (Berryhill et al. 1987). All are surrounded
by 6.5-9.8 ft (2-3 m) deep depressions. Sediments generally consist of silty clay, except near reefs, where
they are much coarser. The submerged Rio Grande Delta is a relict surface with little or no modern
sediment. NE-trending ridges occur on the inner shelf on the relict delta; they are interpreted to have
resulted from block faulting, whereas the central shelf is terraced due to late Pleistocene – Holocene
deposition and erosion (Holmes 1982). The modern Rio Grande River transports little sediment to the
Gulf, and sometimes it is restricted by bar growth across its mouth (Holmes 2011).
Archeological Implications
The potential for buried cultural materials in the offshore study area is interpreted as a function of
two primary factors: the likelihood that cultural materials initially existed and/or were introduced into the
study area; and the potential for such materials to be preserved in the geologic record. During
deglaciation, the south Texas Gulf coastal zone and inner continental shelf contained numerous
stream/river channels associated with the ancestral Rio Grande River. The banks of these rivers would

15

sea level rose, the less time the area was exposed to strong erosional forces in the coastal zone, and
therefore the more likely features will be preserved.
Another factor influencing preservation potential is how rapidly a feature was buried, and
therefore isolated from erosional processes. In the project area, relatively slow rates of mid-late Holocene
sea-level rise, coupled with reduced sediment input, act to decrease preservation potential. Also, the inner
continental shelf in the project area consists of a thin veneer of principally mud-sized sediments
(Anderson et al. 1992). Because these sediments likely have been reworked several times, the
preservation potential is very low for most of the inner shelf. As a result, the highest preservation
potential for drowned and buried prehistoric archaeological sites likely would include buried fluvial,
incised valleys where terraced fluvial deposits have been preserved on channel margins (Anderson et al.
1992: Thomas and Anderson 1994). But once again, these areas also were transgressed during Holocene
sea-level rise, and therefore, likely reworked, as well.

CHAPTER III

RESEARCH DESIGN
RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
A geophysical/cultural resources survey plan for this project was developed in consultation with
the THC and the GLO, and in accordance with the appropriate federal and state standards and guidelines.
RCG&A used the geophysical and geotechnical data to identify magnetic anomalies and acoustic contacts
that could represent significant submerged cultural resources. Submerged cultural resources include, but
are not limited to submerged landforms that have a high probability of containing drowned prehistoric
archaeological sites, and shipwrecks. The identification of submerged landforms with the possibility to
contain prehistoric cultural resources was based on review of sub-bottom profiler records and study of
local geomorphic processes.
The submerged cultural resources data analyses were designed to identify magnetic and sonar
anomalies that represent significant submerged cultural resources. Natural and anthropogenic forces
typically scatter ferrous and non-ferrous objects associated with historic shipwrecks. These objects
normally can be detected with a remote sensing array that includes magnetometer and side scan sonar.
Relict landforms with potential to contain evidence for prehistoric sites often can be detected with a subbottom profiler. Critical elements in the interpretation of side scan sonar and sub-bottom profiler
anomalies are their form, extent, and spatial distribution, and in the case of magnetic anomalies their
signature, amplitude, duration, and patterning. The discrimination of potentially significant cultural
resources from magnetometer, side scan sonar, and sub-bottom profiler data extends beyond review of
these characteristics. The identification of potentially significant submerged cultural resources involves
correlation of data from the entire remote sensing array.
RCG&A conducted detailed analyses of all geophysical survey data acquired in the project area.
The data were analyzed using currently acceptable scientific methodologies. Magnetic contours, anomaly
locations, shipwreck positions, archaeological sites and hazard locations, and side scan sonar data were
projected over navigational charts using ESRI ArcGIS software to ascertain any relationships between
these datasets, and to identify targets that could represent submerged cultural resources. Sub-bottom
profiler data were analyzed to determine the presence or absence of paleo-landforms. All data were

18

correlated via DGPS position data and plotted via ArcGIS. The magnetometer data were contoured to
provide visual aids for interpretation. Remote sensing data also were correlated with a variety of
shipwreck databases, geomorphic and historical research results, nautical charts, and any observations
noted in survey logs and sediment descriptions.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH METHODS
Background research focused on the development of environmental and cultural contexts for the
project area and involved reviews of previous cultural resources investigations and inventories of
identified historic properties and submerged cultural resources (pre- and post-contact period) within and
near the project area. That research included review of readily available historical maps, aerial
photographs, cultural resources survey reports, and other relevant public records, as well as an
examination of the site file and Atlas records at the THC, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Database,
and the National Register of Historic Places files. Additionally, background research included review of
the Office of Coast Survey’s Wrecks and Obstructions database (NOAA 2016), the Office of Coast
Survey's Historical Map & Chart Collection, and the National Centers for Environmental Information
(NCEI) hydrographic survey data and products. The literature search and records review were used to
determine the location of all previously recorded archaeological sites, shipwrecks, historic standing
structures, historic cemeteries, and National Register properties within or adjacent to the project area.

GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY OPERATIONS
Shallow Geophysical Vessel Operations (<20 ft (6.1 m) Depth)
John Chance Land Surveys, Inc. (JCLS) performed the shallow geophysical vessel operations
(<20 ft (6.1 m) depth) on October 4 and 5, 2016, using Freedom Surveyor (Fugro 2016a). This vessel was
built in 2008; it has an overall length of 24 ft and a beam of 8.5 ft. It is powered by two 115hp, four cycle
Yamaha outboard motors and has a fuel capacity of 100 gallons. Freedom Surveyor employed the
Applanix POS MV Inertially-Aided Real-Time Kinematic (IARTK) GPS positioning system. Horizontal
positioning of the survey vessel was accomplished with a Coda F190+ Octopus navigation system
utilizing the Fugro Starfix.HP Navigation Differential Service (NDS), which has a field accuracy of 10–
15 cm under optimal conditions. Fugro survey personnel included a party chief and technician. Sea
conditions consisted of 2 ft ground swells and winds of 10 knots. The shallow-water geophysical survey
suite (Fugro 2016a) included:


Odom Hydrotrac II Single Beam Fathometer;



Reson 7101 Multibeam Bathymetry System;

19



EdgeTech 4125 Side Scan Sonar; and



Geometrics G-882 Marine Magnetometer.

Single Beam Bathymetry
Bathymetric data were collected with the Odom Hydrotrac II Single Beam Echo Sounder and the
Reson 7101 Multibeam Bathymetry System. The Odom Hydrotrac II Single Beam Echo Sounder is
specifically designed for small boat operations and used to support shallow geophysical operations. The
single beam system operated on a 40 Hz ping rate at 24 kHz, and produced data with a resolution of at
least 0.1 ft in shallow water depths (<20 ft (6.1 m)) (Fugro 2016b).
Side Scan Sonar System
The EdgeTech 4125 (400/900 kHz frequency) side scan sonar system utilizes Full Spectrum®
CHIRP technology to provide high resolution imagery. It was operated at a 164 ft (50 m) range to
maximize seafloor coverage while maintaining resolution (Fugro 2016b).
Magnetometer
A Geometrics G-882 cesium marine magnetometer was used to record the strength of the earth’s
magnetic field in increments of nanoTesla (nT), a unit of magnetic flux density equal to 10−5 gauss (or
one gamma). The G-882 has a sensitivity of 0.1 nT and is equipped with an altimeter. Total field readings
were logged at 0.5 seconds (sampling rate), as were sensor depth and altitude data; it was monitored
throughout the survey to maintain consistent sensor height. The magnetometer layback was 60.3 ft (18.4
m). It was towed 4.8-20.6 ft (1.5-6.3 m) above the seafloor (Fugro 2016b).
Deep Geophysical Survey Operations (>20 ft (6.1 m) Depth)
Fugro Geoservices, Inc. (Fugro) performed the deep water (>20 ft (6.1 m) depth) geophysical
investigations from September 15, 2016, to October 18, 2016 (Fugro 2016b). Fugro executed the project
using the survey vessel M/V Fugro Enterprise (Figure III-1). Enterprise, built in 2007, is 170 ft in length,
with a beam of 40 ft and a maximum draft of 11 ft. This vessel is powered by two Caterpillar 3508 Tier 2
engines capable of generating 2,000 horsepower with a cruising speed of 11.5 knots; its fuel capacity
(54,000 gallons) allows it to operate for up to 28 continuous days before refueling. Horizontal positioning
of the survey vessel was accomplished with the Fugro Starfix.HP Differential Global Positioning System
(DGPS), which has a field accuracy of <3.3 ft (1 m). Sea conditions during the survey varied, with winds
ranging from five to 17 knots and seas ranging from 1-4 ft (0.3-1.2 m) (Fugro 2016a).

20

DIX Shipping Company, Inc. served as the Port agent, arranged the berthing assignment (Dock
#13) for Enterprise, and interfaced with the Harbor Master for customs formalities and port security.
For survey operations, Fugro mobilized the following instrumentation on board Enterprise:


Sea-Bird CTD Velocity Profiler (water column);



Reson 7101 Multibeam Bathymetry System;



EdgeTech 3200, 2-16 kHz Sub-bottom Profiler;



Applied Acoustics Systems 400-14,000 Hz Single Plate Boomer;



300-600 kHz EdgeTech Model 4200 Side Scan Sonar;



SeaSPY Marine Magnetometer with Depth Sensor.

Water Column Velocity Profiles
Water column profiles were recorded with a Sea-Bird Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD)
Velocity Profiler from the sea surface to the seafloor and back to the sea surface for each deployment of
the instrument. The conductivity, temperature, and depth data were downloaded to a shipboard computer
for quality control and final speed-of-sound calculations.
Multibeam Echo Sounding
The Reson 7101 Multibeam Bathymetry System was used to collect hydrographic data to
generate depth profiles along the centerline. The multibeam system produced data with a resolution of at
least 1.5 ft (0.5 m) in water depths shallower than 150 ft (45.7 m), and 3 ft (0.9 m) or better than 2% of
water depth resolution in water depths beyond 150 ft (45.7 m).

Sub-Bottom Profilers (CHIRP and Boomer)
The sub-bottom data were collected with an EdgeTech 3200 (2-16 kHz) Sub-bottom Profiler
(CHIRP) system capable of achieving a vertical bed separation of at least 1 ft (0.3 m) in the uppermost
30-50 ft (9.1-15.2 m) of sediment, depending on substrate. These data were used to develop a
stratigraphic profile along the route to a depth of 16 ft (4.9m) below seafloor/seabed. Confidence checks
included verification that the unit was transmitting and receiving signals, that accurate positioning
information was being input to the system via the GPS interface, and that data logging was fully
functional.
A Geoacoustics Boomer Sub-bottom Profiler (500-14,000 Hz) single plate boomer system was
deployed during the collection of sub-bottom data. The boomer system can achieve 100 to 500
milliseconds of sub-bottom (230-460 ft [70-140 m] below mudline) in ideal environments. The energy

22

source for the boomer was operated at 100-300 joules, with an effective bandwidth range of 500 to 14,000
Hz. Each pulse had an average amplitude of 0.2 Bar-meters or greater. The boomer system was towed
behind the vessel during operation with a single geophone receiver (Fugro 2016a, 2016b).
Side Scan Sonar Systems
The EdgeTech Model 4200 Side Scan Sonar System (300-600 kHz frequency) was towed at a
150 ft (45.7 m) range to maximize seafloor coverage while maintaining resolution. The sonar was towed
above the seafloor at a distance that was 10-20% of the range of the instrument.
Magnetometers
A SeaSPY Marine Magnetometer (with depth sensor) was used to identify buried hazards. The
track line spacing ran parallel to the centerline at 65 ft (19.8 m) intervals throughout the centerline and
anchor handling survey corridors. The SeaSPY Marine Magnetometer has a sensitivity of ≤1.0 nT peak to
peak. Field verification by a third party, a quality assurance and control process, insured that the
background noise did not exceed 3.0 nT peak to peak. The sampling rate exceeded 4.0 Hz. Survey line
number, time, sensor position and altitude, and speed were included on all output data. The magnetometer
altitude varied with water depth and bottom topography, but did not exceed 20 ft (6.1 m) off of the
seafloor.
Equipment Calibration and Validation Testing
Fugro carried out system calibrations and validations prior to embarking from Patterson, LA and
then at the Port of Brownsville. Validations included checks on positioning, gyros, and vessel offsets
(Figure III-2). Technicians performed a complete dockside check of all geophysical systems. Once the
Fugro Party Manager and an independent QA/QC Field Representative agreed that all systems had been
checked and were operating satisfactorily, Fugro Enterprise departed for the project area. While
underway to the project area, technicians conducted various checks on the survey equipment, including
roll, pitch, heading, latency, index error, and offset checks, in advance of starting the first survey trackline
(Fugro 2016c).
Survey Control and Correlations of Data Sets
The survey applied the Texas State Plane South Projection in U.S. Feet, North American Datum
(NAD) 1983, and all final data were referenced to the same.

GEOTECHNICAL OPERATIONS
Geotechnical Vessel Operations (>20 ft (6.1 m) Depth)
Geotechnical investigations were conducted aboard Fugro Americas from October 28 to
November 1, 2016 (Fugro 2016a). Americas was built in 2015. It is 193 ft in length, with a beam of 41 ft,
a draft of 15 ft, a fuel capacity of 104,000 gallons, a maximum speed of 12 knots, a cruising speed of 10
knots. Equipment included a Box Corer and the P-5 Electric Vibracorer. Horizontal positioning of the
survey vessel was accomplished with the Fugro Starpack differential Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS), which has a field accuracy of < 3 ft (1 m). Sea conditions during this portion of the work were
moderate, with winds ranging from 5-21 knots and seas ranging from 5-7 ft (1.5-2.1 m). Fugro survey
personnel included a party chief, six technicians, two navigators, and two vibracore specialists (Fugro
2016a).

PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 OFFSHORE DATA COLLECTION
The requirements of the offshore survey operation included collecting sub-bottom data, side scan
data, magnetometer data, and bathymetric data of the seafloor. Details of the data collection requirements
are defined below. All data collection activities adhered to the minimum standards and guidelines
specified in the Texas Administrative Code (Title 13, Part 2, and Chapter 28). The data were transferred
to RCG&A in accordance with standard data transfer protocols (Appendix VII).
The data collected during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 seafloor survey operations included marine
magnetometer, seismic (sub-bottom profiler and boomer), side scan sonar, and multibeam echo sounding
data for each segment of the centerline and anchor handling corridors. All survey sensors were operated
simultaneously.
Phase 1 – Preliminary Pipeline Centerline Survey
A Phase 1 preliminary pipeline centerline survey was designed and executed to ensure that there
were no obvious obstacles or “fatal flaws” within the selected centerline corridor such as seabed features,
shipwrecks, etc., that could impact the constructability of the pipeline (e.g., abrupt topographic changes,
exposed rock, etc.). Phase 1 examined a 600 ft (128.9 m) centerline corridor; line spacing was 65 ft (20
m) and consisted of 131 primary tracklines (Appendix I).
Data collection and processing and evaluation of data were performed on board Fugro Enterprise
and incorporated into the evaluation process. This phase involved additional investigation activities of any
identified areas of concerns during the selection process to determine the most favorable route. Once the
centerline was established, wider survey corridor coverage, (e.g., Phase 2), commenced. The intent of this
phase was to continue data acquisition with all systems in order to assess the impact corridor including

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND
ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Senior Nautical Archeologist, James S. Schmidt, M.A., conducted research at the THC, and
examined the shipwreck information cards, which frequently hold additional information that is not
available in Texas Archeological Atlas files database. That information was incorporated into the historic
contexts and analyses. The review of reports available at the THC and online from the U. S. Coastal
Survey found that ten archaeological and four hydrographic studies have been conducted within and in
the vicinity of the project area. Details for each of these reports are shown in Table IV-1. In general, most
of the targets identified during these surveys were evaluated as disassociated and largely modern debris.
However, three studies (Enright et al. 2012; Hoyt and Gearhart 1992; Hoyt et al. 1991) encountered the
disarticulated remnants of one or more versions of the mid-nineteenth century railroad built in association
with the Brazos Santiago military depot. These same reports also describe a grid-like concentration of
pilings, a feature most likely related to a wharf or pier depicted on late nineteenth century engineering
maps of the former military depot (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992: Figure 12). All of these features were
recorded in the vicinity of the northern tip of Brazos Island, a location slightly north of the current project
area.
Two archaeological sites (41CR125 and 41CF184) also were identified on Boca Chica/Del Mar
Beach (Hall et al. 2002; Leshikar 1980), an area that now is part of the Brazos Island State Park. Both
sites represent the remains of wrecked wooden sailing vessels that now lie on the beach, but likely
originally were stranded in shallow waters just offshore. According to a 1975 geological study of
shoreline changes on Brazos Island, the Boca Chica shoreline accreted rapidly after the present jetties
were installed at the entrance to Brazos Santiago Pass in 1934 (Morton and Pieper 1975:10). None of
these sites or features lie directly within the project corridors.

28

Until relatively recently, Clovis/Folsom fluted projectile points generally were considered to
reflect the earliest human cultures in South Texas (Hester 1995:433). Paleoindians are thought to have
pursued a nomadic lifestyle that depended principally upon hunting Late Pleistocene fauna, including
mammoths, although excavations at other sites in South Texas seem to reflect a greater variety of food
resources (Hester 1995:435). Of the numerous recorded Clovis period sites in Texas, the most famous
may be the deeply stratified Gault site in Bell County, which has yielded thousands of artifacts from
13,000 year old contexts (Malakoff 2008:26). More recent studies have pushed the “first occupation” date
further back in time. So-called “pre-Clovis” sites in South Texas include the Debra Friedkin Site, also in
Bell County, where excavations have revealed what has been termed the Buttermilk Creek Complex. This
assemblage of over 15,000 lithic artifacts recovered from a stratum beneath a Clovis period deposit has
been dated between 13,500 and 15,500 BP (Bryn 2013). A later variety of finely crafted spear points
including such types as the Angostura, Lerma, Plainview, and Scottsbluff, represent what Hester
(1995:435-436) has termed the “Later Paleoindian” stage.
However, most of these sites are located well away from the Gulf Coast. The dynamic nature of
the present coastal environment has complicated investigations of coastal Paleoindian/Early Archaic
occupations. Evidence of early human occupation in the lower Rio Grande delta is particularly scarce. For
example, Anderson’s early investigations in the Laguna Acosta National Wildlife Refuge yielded only a
single isolated Clovis fluted point (Norton et al. 2013:10). Equally significant is the relative absence of
research initiatives designed specifically to examine previously exposed landforms that now lie well
offshore. One of the few studies that have targeted this question was conducted in the 1980s along the
northern Texas Gulf Coast, in the so-called Paleo-Sabine area where researchers recovered evidence of
early occupation along the tributary channels of the ancestral Sabine and Trinity rivers. Two probable
sites with potential late Paleoindian/Early Archaic components were identified beneath 15 ft (4.5 m) of
sediment nearly 8.1 mi (13 km) offshore of the present coastline (Faught and Gusick 2011:147). Similar
loci could be present in the vicinity of the present project area.
Archaic Period
The end of the Late Paleoindian stage at ca. 10,000 BP (UT-Austin 2009a) marks the beginning
of the Archaic period of Texas prehistory. The transition between the Paleoindian and Archaic periods
probably occurred gradually. As with the previous period, much of the now inundated continental shelf
off the Gulf coast would have been exposed and available for human habitation, and Early Archaic period
sites could be present on appropriate submerged landforms.
Chronologies of Texas prehistory recognize three subdivisions of this period: Early, Middle, and
Late. Early Archaic subsistence strategies and settlement patterns likely resembled those of the previous

32

Paleoindian period. Hester (1995:436) originally posited that “these [Archaic] peoples operated as small
bands, highly mobile and wide ranging due to the arid climate inferred for part of this time frame.” He
defined two cultural horizons for the Early Archaic period (10,000-7,000 BP) (UT-Austin 2009a) in
southern Texas: “Early Corner Notched” and “Early Basal Notched” (Hester 1995:436-438). The former
horizon is recognized archaeologically by the presence of bifurcate-base projectile points and a set of
flaked implements collectively known as “Guadalupe tools,” while later diagnostics include deeply
basally notched, long-stemmed, barbed points like the Bell and Andice types. More recent studies,
however, have expanded the cultural picture of the Early Archaic. For example, the principal feature at
the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98), excavated ca. 2001 on the floodplain of the Guadalupe River upstream
from San Antonio Bay, was a ca. 8,000-7,000 BP cemetery that contained the remains of as many as 200
individuals. The cultural materials recovered from this Early Archaic site, including groundstone
bannerstones, flint projectile points, beads, shell pendants, and antler and bone tools (Tewes 2006; UTAustin 2009b), suggest a more diverse and technologically advanced culture than previously thought.
Much of the basic information about the Middle Archaic period (ca. 7,000-4,000 BP) in southern
Texas comes from interior sites like those along the middle Nueces River and Rio Grande drainages; as
with the Early Archaic, indicators of Middle Archaic coastal occupation are sparse, particularly in the Rio
Grande Delta (Norton et al. 2013:11; Wagner 2001). In general, the settlement pattern appears to have
assumed a distinctly riverine orientation, with floodplains, levees, and low terraces the preferred locations
for open camp sites. Formal hearths and earth ovens are characteristic features of camp sites; large
discrete cemeteries in which the burials often contain grave goods also continued during the Middle
Archaic Period. Triangular darts and stemmed points are diagnostic of this period, as are small, unifacial
“Dimmit” tools that may have been utilized as gouges; tubular sandstone pipes sometimes are found in
association with human burials. Resources derived from indigenous plant species appear to have formed a
significant part of the Middle Archaic diet (Hester 1995:438-440). Materials recovered from the welldocumented Laureles site (41KL71), located on Baffin Bay south of Corpus Christi, have provided ample
evidence that Middle Archaic coastal dwellers in that area also exploited a variety of shellfish resources
(Smith and Black 2009).
The transition into the Late Archaic cultural period along the central Texas coast occurred
sometime between 4,000-3,000 BP, although there may have been a 500-year hiatus in occupation at the
end of the Middle Archaic (Ricklis 2016; UT-Austin 2009a). Hester places the onset of this period for all
of the South Texas region somewhat later, at around 2,400 BP. Late Archaic sites occur with greater
frequency, and feature large deposits of fire-cracked rock, hearths and earth ovens, as well as manos and
metates that clearly reflect activities devoted to processing a variety of plant resources. Faunal remains
recovered from Late Archaic contexts also evidence exploitation of a broad range of species, from deer to

33

smaller animals, as well as reptiles and freshwater fin-and shellfish. In interior regions, stream channels or
associated sloughs seem to have been preferred for occupation sites (Hester 1995:441-442).
Perhaps the most important consideration in evaluating the archaeological record along the Gulf
Coast is the stabilization of the modern bay/barrier island system, including Padre Island, at its present
position between 5,000 and 3,000 BP (Morton and Pieper 1975:Figure 6). Late Archaic sites in coastal
settings reflect the continued use of saltwater marine resources in addition to dietary elements obtained
through traditional foraging and hunting practices (Norton et al. 2013:11; Smith and Black 2009).
Analyses of faunal remains recovered from the Baffin Bay area suggest that water salinity changed
markedly throughout this period, as more arid conditions prevailed and as the barrier island system
formed. These changes resulted in differences in the species that were available (Smith and Black 2009).
Both Middle and Late Archaic period sites could be encountered in relatively shallow nearshore
regions traversed by the present project, although Wagner (2001) maintained that “evidence of Archaic
and earlier occupations in the Rio Grande Delta” was sparse, likely due to site burial and/or destruction
resulting from flooding and/or hurricane activity.
Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1200 BP-1500 A.D.)
During late prehistory, occupation in the Rio Grande Delta region increased markedly, as
evidenced by the appearance of the culturally distinctive Brownsville-Barril complex. The lifeways of this
group are reminiscent of those of earlier Archaic period populations in that the subsistence strategy
continued to depend upon a combination of hunting, foraging, fishing, and shellfishing. These people,
much like the historic period Karankawa, used dugout canoes to navigate the shallow waters of back bays
like the Laguna Madre (Francaviglia 1998:22). A wide range of shell tools and ornaments seems to have
been a particular hallmark of this culture (Prewitt 1971). Absent readily available lithic material, the stone
implements and tools, including the characteristic small triangular chert Cameron points and tubular stone
pipes that have been recovered from Brownsville sites, were fashioned out of imported lithic materials
(Wagner 2001). The presence of non-local materials on Brownsville sites, coupled with the recovery of
Brownsville-like shell materials from archaeological contexts outside of South Texas, suggest trade
connections with other groups, particularly those that lived further south along the Gulf Coast (Fort 2016;
Hester 1995:448-449).
Distinctive burial customs were characteristic of the Brownsville-Barril peoples. Tightly flexed
burials interred away from living areas apparently were the norm (Norton et al. 2013:12), and “exotic”
grave goods frequently accompanied these interments. One form of exotic grave good consisted of
segments of human long bones decorated with incised designs frequently accentuated with applied
pigments like red ochre (Smith and Black 2009). Brownsville-Barril complex graves also have yielded

34

materials that reflect origins much further south, including Huastecan-type ceramic vessels; obsidian
arrow points from central Mexico; jadeite (greenstone) jewelry; and even figurines from central Mexico
(Hester 1995:447-448; Smith and Black 2009; Wagner 2001). Stratified sites from this period occur most
frequently in on-shore terrestrial settings, although, as Wagner (2001) has pointed out, “the majority of
the archaeological record (in the Rio Grande Delta) has been destroyed” through a combination of
damming upriver and intensive modern agricultural development.

HISTORIC CONTEXT
Historic Period
The Historic period commenced ca. 1500 A.D., when the Spanish first established a presence on
the mainland of Central America. However, as Wagner (2001) noted, the Rio Grande Delta region “was
one of the last parts of northeastern Mexico to be explored and settled by the Spanish.” Hester (1995)
observed that the passage of Spanish explorers through this region “had no lasting effect on the native
groups... and left few written records about them,” while Norton et al. (2013:13) mentioned other sporadic
intrusions by various Spanish expeditions through the seventeenth century. This suggests that the
indigenous peoples that lived along the South Texas coast were more or less able to pursue their
traditional pre-contact lifeways until the mid-eighteenth century, when the Spanish first established
permanent settlements (Norton et al 2013:13).
This apparent lack of interest in colonization did not mean that Texas’ southern coastal plain
remained entirely clear of Spanish contact. Alonso Álvarez de Pineda, commissioned by the governor of
Jamaica to map the Gulf Coast, apparently was the first European to enter El Paso de Brazos Santiago
(Kelley 1986:3, 16). Moreover, Spanish convoys that left the Mexican port of Vera Cruz regularly
traveled along portions of the southern Gulf Coast en route to Havana, Cuba; Spanish vessels during this
period included larger cargo ships known as naos (Francaviglia 1998:49). In 1554, one of these convoys,
composed of four vessels, wrecked on Padre Island about 50 mi south of Corpus Christi Bay. Three
hundred people perished, either in the wreck itself or during the survivors’ ill-fated overland trek south to
Tampico. The Spanish government attempted, with mixed success, to salvage the contents of these
vessels. Both the wreck sites and camp sites of the salvage expeditions are now protected as part of the
Padre Island National Seashore (Drolet and Stryker 2016).
Colonial Contact and Early Settlement
The earliest permanent settlements along the Rio Grande, in what is now Cameron County, took
the form of extensive stock ranches (Francaviglia 1998:75). The Spanish government began to issue
official land grants, known as porciones, in 1767; the largest and most valuable of these included

35

riverfront acreage that enabled grant recipients to irrigate their properties and to ship their products out of
the area (Lang and Long 2016; Norton et al. 2013:14). Several communities, the largest of which was
Refugio (later known as Matamoros) some 25 mi upriver from the mouth of the Rio Grande also were
developed. Along the barrier islands, the small villages at El Fronton, Brazos Santiago, and Boca Chica
beach apparently were used primarily as summer resorts during this period (EHA 1991:12; Garza 2010b).
Predictably, relatively few vessels traversed the often treacherous and uncharted coast; local
residents used smaller skiffs to navigate the more protected waters of the shallow lagoons and rivers
(Francavigilia 1998:89). However, as other international powers (e.g., France, Great Britain, and the
United States) expanded their commercial interests during the eighteenth century, a more diverse array of
vessel types, including sloops, frigates, brigantines and brigs, began to appear in Gulf waters. In the
1770s, Americans also introduced their own unique vessel, the schooner, which eventually became the
work horse of the commercial fleet in the nineteenth century (Francaviglia 1998:60-61, 79).
Mexican Sovereignty and the Texas Republic
When Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, South Texas became part the
Mexican state of Tamaulipas. The new government failed to produce much in the way of economic
change, and cattle ranching remained the principal economic pursuit in the Rio Grande Delta area. The
population of Tamaulipas remained sparse, despite efforts by the provincial government to encourage
settlement, using its authority under the terms of the 1825 National Colonization Law, the same
legislation that also encouraged large numbers of Americans to re-locate to Texas (Barker 2016).
However, most Americans settled well north of the Rio Grande, and the local population remained
predominantly Mexican.
Mexican jurisdiction in the region was represented by a government customs house and fort at
Brazos Santiago, facilities that reportedly were destroyed by a hurricane prior to 1836 (Bell and Jackson
1971). The villages of El Fronton, located at what is now Port Isabel, and Baghdad, a “miserable
collection of fishing shanties” on the south bank at the mouth of the Rio Grande, constituted the only
“urban” enclaves on the coast (Bond et al. 1990:25; Cutter 2010; Hathcock 2015). Matamoros, the largest
city in Tamaulipas, was designated in 1823 as an official port of entry, thereby inaugurating a thriving
commercial connection with Brazos Santiago, the most accessible anchorage for commercial shipping.
Goods offloaded at Brazos Santiago were transported overland to Matamoros, which by the 1830s
boasted a diverse international population of merchants (Bond et al. 1990:30; EHA 1991:14). From
Matamoros, these imports then were distributed into the interior.
Establishing and maintaining an efficient and reliable transportation system to sustain this
commerce, particularly along the middle and upper Rio Grande, constituted a thorny problem for the

36

region’s entrepreneurs (Kelley 1986). A wide range of vessel types engaged in this commerce; by the
1830s, sidewheel steamers transported cargo and passengers in offshore open waters, while sternwheelers
and even keelboats plied the interior waters of the Rio Grande. Ancillary steam-powered craft, including
tugs and dredges, also operated in the Texas Gulf (Francaviglia 1998:130-136, 182), while lighters
transferred cargoes to and from ocean-going ships at ports throughout the region.
In 1832, simmering tensions between the Mexican government and a growing population of
“Texicans” erupted into full-scale conflict. Although most military engagements took place well north of
the Rio Grande delta (Norton et al. 2013:14), there were two minor naval skirmishes at Brazos Santiago
(Bond et al. 1990:31). The Texas Revolution culminated in the defeat and surrender of Mexican general
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna in 1836, and in the establishment of the Republic of Texas. For the next
nine years, that portion of the former state of Tamaulipas between the Nueces River and Rio Grande,
including the delta region, remained a major point of friction (Bond et al. 1990:27). The formal admission
of Texas into the United States in December of 1845, which recognized the Rio Grande as the southern
boundary of the newly created state, played a central role in precipitating the Mexican War in 1846.

The Mexican War
Armed conflict came to the Rio Grande delta within two months of the official rupture of
diplomatic relations between the United States and Mexico. Starting from Corpus Christi, American
General Zachary Taylor led a force of over 3,500 troops south towards Brazos Santiago and the village of
El Fronton, then described as “an insignificant post with a few mean houses.” The Mexican residents
retreated in front of this advance, burning the customs house and the village of “grass-thatched cottages,
made of reeds, or spars of wrecked vessels” as they fled (Bond et al. 1990:33-34). The large supply depot
that Taylor subsequently established at Brazos Santiago included a brick fort, a customs house, and
warehouses (Bell and Jackson 1971; Ziesmer 1910), as well as improvements designed to accommodate
commercial and military shipping (Enright et al. 2012:9). Taylor’s forces then proceeded up the north
bank of the Rio Grande to a point opposite the town of Matamoros, where they erected another
fortification that came to be known as Fort Brown. American and Mexican troops contested the territory
between Brazos Santiago and Fort Brown for the next two months, until the Mexican defeat at the Battle
of Resaca de la Palma (Bond et al. 1990:35-36).
As a major supply link throughout the Mexican War, the anchorage at Brazos Santiago
accommodated a considerable amount of vessel traffic. One historian described its harbor as “filled with
vessels laden with supplies for the army, and of every possible size. . .” (Banks 1983, quoted in Bond et
al. 1990:34). A report filed in 1849 by the Quartermaster General for Brazos Santiago noted that during
his tenure in that position, no fewer than 1,155 vessels (brigs, sloops, schooners, and steamers) unloaded

37

A central element of this realigned supply system was a 9 mi long narrow-gauge railroad that ran
south along the coast from Brazos Santiago to White’s Ranch near the mouth of the Rio Grande; from that
point, supplies were re-shipped on steamboats to the Federal troops at Fort Brown. The railroad itself was
heavily defended. A fort was constructed to guard the railroad bridge over Boca Chica, and an ancillary
Federal enclave was established at Clarksville, “a small place of no importance” near the mouth of the
Rio Grande (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:30-34). Elements of this railroad (or of its later successor) were
identified archaeologically during investigations on Brazos Island (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:30).
Union forces abandoned the railroad following their withdrawal from Fort Brown in July of 1864,
but they continued to augment their base of operations at the northern end of Brazos Island and at Port
Isabel. Over time, the supply depot expanded to include not only a strengthened fortification, but also a
post hospital and numerous ancillary structures. Of particular interest were upgrades designed to enhance
shipping. A permanent 34 ft high wooden light tower replaced the earlier moveable structure (USCG
2017), and contemporary accounts mention not only an “old wharf,” but also that construction of a wood
and coal wharf had commenced early in 1865. “Two large flatboats, twelve yawls, and a small schooner
used as a pilot boat” served the inshore transportation needs of the garrison (Col. R. B. Jones to Lt. Col.
George B. Drake [February 28, 1865], quoted in Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:39).
The war’s end did not signal a marked slowdown in activity, neither at Brazos Santiago nor at the
mouth of the Rio Grande. Herron’s railroad was rebuilt (Bell and Jackson 1971) and sold to private
investors, and further improvements were in the planning stages at the depot. However, two years later, a
violent hurricane wiped out both Baghdad and Clarksville, its “insignificant” American “twin” just across
the Rio Grande (Hathcock 2015). The same storm also destroyed “every building at Brazos Santiago,”
including the rebuilt railroad, whose ruined assets again were sold in 1868 (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:4445).
Late Nineteenth – Early Twentieth Century
After the Civil War, A combination of factors determined the economic fortunes of Cameron
County in general and of the Port Isabel/Brazos Santiago area in particular. Between 1869 and 1870
alone, over four million dollars’ worth of goods ranging from hides to machinery passed through Brazos
Santiago (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:46). The area’s continued economic prosperity depended upon
maintaining and enhancing the antebellum transportation links that funneled those goods from the interior
through Brownsville and Matamoros, and out through the port. That link became more permanent when
the 22 mi long Rio Grande Railroad, completed in 1871, began operating the following year (Garza
2010a; Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:49; Ziesmer 1910). Lighters ferried goods between Port Isabel’s railroad
wharf, shown clearly on navigation charts of this period, to larger vessels anchored outside the bar at

41

(Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:Figure 12). These changes may in part explain why the military finally
abandoned its Brazos Santiago depot in the 1880s (Bell and Jackson 1971).
What ultimately curtailed Port Isabel’s thriving commercial activity was competition from
alternate transportation networks during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The firm of
King and Kenedy, whose principals had been major players on the Rio Grande during the Civil War, took
steps to stimulate the development of the City of Brownsville. This partnership, which vigorously
opposed the Rio Grande Railroad, worked incessantly to scuttle that enterprise. The partners initially
established a competing transportation link using steamboats based near the mouth of the Rio Grande to
transport goods up to Brownsville (Kelley 1986:46, 51). In 1905, contemporary sources hinted that this
firm also played a role in arranging measures that sabotaged the Laguna Madre Channel--including the
sinking of the steamer Luzon in the turning basin—as well as advocating for the completion of alternative
railroad lines. In the end, the inauguration of several rail lines that entirely by-passed the Rio Grande delta
(most notably the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexican Railroad), coupled with the channel’s inability to
accommodate ever-larger ocean-going steamers, ended Port Isabel’s commercial heyday (Kelley 1986:85;
Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:52-53; Ziesmer 2010). Frank Pierce noted in 1917 that “Brazos Santiago bar and
the once-busy little towns within three miles of it are now deserted” (quoted in Hoyt and Gearhart
1992:53).
Mid-Late Twentieth Century
The seeds of Port Isabel’s eventual renaissance were being sown even as the port and its
anchorage were declining. Beginning in 1911, individuals associated with the newly formed Brownsville
Waterways Association began to push for harbor improvements, including the creation of a ship channel
linking Laguna Madre with port facilities at Brownsville. Through the 1920s, local business interests,
funded in part with Congressional appropriations, made several unsuccessful attempts to penetrate the
Brazos Santiago bar and dredge channels through Laguna Madre (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992:54, 57). Some
of this work apparently had been completed by 1933. The navigation chart prepared in that year (Figure
IV-8) depicts two short wing jetties at the entrance to Brazos Santiago Pass, and a 25 ft deep channel that
extended across Laguna Madre to a turning basin south of Port Isabel (USCS 1933).
Congressional funds provided by the River and Harbors Act of 1930 underwrote the final
completion of the 17 mi long Brownsville Ship Channel and its attendant turning basin and terminal
facilities, which formally opened to traffic in 1936 (Garza and Long 2010). Part of the project included
construction of two 1,500 ft long jetties at the entrance to Brazos Santiago Pass (Hoyt and Gearhart
1992:57). These improvements and subsequent expansion of the facilities established the port of

45

regional economy. Garza (2010b) notes that a small tourist-oriented resort village existed from ca. 19401955 at Del Mar on Brazos Island, while the settlement at the southern end of Padre Island eventually was
incorporated as the town of South Padre Island in 1973 (NPS 2016), following earlier attempts to develop
that area’s tourist potential (Leatherwood 2010).
These new kinds of activities impacted both the types and numbers of vessels and the
navigational improvements and other enhancements designed to meet their needs. Commercial fishing
vessels and small recreational craft became regular participants in the overall marine traffic in the area. A
protected boat basin/marina was constructed at Port Isabel. New channels also were dredged to
accommodate this traffic, most notably the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, which had been extended to Port
Isabel, with a connecting link to the Laguna Madre/Brownsville Ship Channel, by the early 1950s (Figure
IV-9) (U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey [USCGS] 1953). Beginning in 1954, the Queen Isabella
Causeway allowed vehicular traffic to travel between Port Isabel and the developing resort of South Padre
Island; this structure was replaced in 1974 by the current high-span bridge over Laguna Madre (Garza
2010a). Navigation charts also show that, by 1966, the first offshore artificially created fish haven,
designed to enhance recreational fishing, was in place northeast of the Brazos Santiago Pass. The fish
haven offshore of the mouth of the Rio Grande, currently is included within the present project corridor,
was created atop a previously mapped vessel wreck sometime between 1987 and 1992 (USCGS 1966,
1992).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL POTENTIAL WITHIN THE PROJECT AREA
Examination of the Office of Coast Survey’s Wrecks and Obstructions database (NOAA 2016),
the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Database, the Northern Shipwreck database, the BOEM shipwreck
database, and other shipwreck databases indicates that only nine vessel wrecks or obstructions lie directly
within the proposed project area or the 0.5 mi buffer surrounding the center line (Table IV-2). However,
consideration of a broader area, including the waters surrounding the entrance to Brazos Santiago Pass
and adjacent beaches as well as the waters and submerged flats of the Laguna Madre, expands that
defined list to include 45 additional wrecks. The high incidence of identified vessel remains within this
broader area illustrates the intensity with which the Brazos Santiago/Port Isabel anchorage has been
utilized over the last century and a half. These vessels represent nearly every type and time period,
ranging from mid-nineteenth century wooden sail-powered craft and steamboats to late twentieth century
commercial fishing boats, barges, and even drilling rigs. The waters both inshore and offshore therefore
should be considered as high potential areas for submerged cultural resources.

ARCHEOLOGICAL ANALYSES OF THE
GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY RESULTS

GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY DATA ANALYSES
Data Processing
Multibeam Processing
On-vessel processing of the Multi-Beam Echo Sounder (MBES) was reduced to Mean Sea
Surface during Phase 1, utilizing the Danish DNSC08 ellipsoid model v. GPS-heights of the vessel. The
resulting depths were validated with coastal tide measurements and translated to the Mean Lower Low
Water datum. Preliminary on-vessel bathymetric processing used satellite-projected tides, co-tidally
reduced to survey location. Final Digital Terrain Mapping (DTMs) were merged with the near shore data
sets, which were provided after completion of both the offshore and near shore surveys. Vessel elevations
were monitored and compared to satellite-produced tidal projections to reduce tide element distortion in
the final data deliverables.
Bathymetric Processing
The bathymetric data were used to generate depth profiles. Contours were defined by 1-ft
intervals, with 10-ft intervals shown more prominently. DGPS was used for horizontal positioning of all
survey vessels. A RTK (Real Time Kinematics) GPS base station was established for the Phase 2 survey
operation. This device provided an elevation component that was used to account for tidal adjustments.
Sub-bottom Profilers Processing
All sub-bottom profiler (boomer and CHIRP) recordings were motion compensated with a POS
MV 320 to provide accurate position, heading, altitude, heave, and velocity data for the survey vessel and
remote sensing equipment. EdgeTech’s topside processor, running EdgeTech’s Discover acquisition and
processing software, exported deliverable files in SEGY and JPEG format. The sub-bottom profiler data
were interpreted utilizing the 2d/3d PAK® Kingdom Suite Software (Fugro 2016b).

53

Side Scan Sonar Processing
All sonar channels were recorded with the Chesapeake Sonar Wiz software: SSS/SBP raw XTF
and SGY data files. A real-time waterfall displayed the side scan sonar and magnetometer data. The side
scan sonar data were interpreted using Chesapeake Technology’s SonarWiz.MAP software package
(Fugro 2016b).
Magnetometer Data Processing
Fugro used a Marine Magnetics (SeaSPY) high-resolution marine magnetometer with spare for
detection of ferrous materials on and below the seafloor. This application assisted in the location and
confirmation of ferrous debris/wreckage and of existing cables. All data were logged digitally (including
information on towfish depth and navigation information), and processed for interpretation on a
Chesapeake SonarWiz workstation. Data were presented at multiple scales. Raw, all-inclusive data and
processed profiles were stored digitally.
Background noise for the magnetometer consisted of a combination of vessel noise, ground effect
and noise created by shipping activities. Fugro’s experience on the planned survey vessel suggested that
background noise with an amplitude of approximately 1-2 nT was to be expected in shallow water areas.
BOEM standards seek to maintain a background noise level of less than 3 gammas peak to peak.
The collected data were reviewed for quality control by the Operator and Party Manager. All
survey data were returned to the office for inventory. Copies of the survey logs and the navigation disk
also were returned to the office for final post processing.

CULTURAL RESOURCES ASSESSMENT - DATA INTERPRETATION
Methodologies
Detailed cultural resources analyses were conducted of all remote sensing data. All data were
analyzed using currently acceptable scientific methodologies. The data then were correlated with a variety
of shipwreck databases, geomorphic and historical research results, nautical charts, and any observations
noted in survey logs during data collection. Submerged cultural resources include shipwrecks and
disposal sites, and submerged prehistoric and historic archaeological sites. These objects and deposits
normally can be detected with a remote sensing array that includes a marine magnetometer, side scan
sonar, and a sub-bottom profiler.
Side scan sonar records (979 records/295 contacts) were analyzed to help distinguish topographic
features on the seabed and any objects protruding above the bottom sediments. The interpretation of side
scan sonar records involves recognition of any distinct patterns indicating projection or depression;
descriptions of all sonar contacts included measurements such as length, area, and approximate height

54

above seabed. For archaeological materials (e.g., shipwrecks), higher side scan frequencies and shorter
ranges increase the likelihood of detecting older sites with small acoustic profiles.
Magnetic data collected during survey were examined carefully following post processing. For
each magnetic anomaly (n=902), the profile was examined to determine amplitude, duration, signature
(monopole, dipole or complex) and areal distribution (detectable across multiple track lines). Individual
anomalies express distinctive magnetic signatures. A magnetic signature may be categorized as a
monopole or a dipole, or other configuration (i.e., simple, complex, or multi-component). Monopole
signatures frequently indicate greater distance to the source. They are registered as positive or negative
deflections from the ambient magnetic field, depending on how the object is oriented relative to the
magnetometer sensor. Simple dipoles present a rise and a fall above and below the ambient magnetic
field; they also commonly are associated with single source anomalies. However, the expression of the
poles results from the objects’ magnetization and configuration. Multi-component or complex signature
anomalies consist of both dipole and monopole magnetic perturbations that are associated with a large
overall deflection that can be indicative of debris patterns similar to those associated with shipwrecks
having large ferrous components and other significant submerged cultural resources. The complexity of a
magnetic signature is affected partially by the distance of the sensor from the ferrous mass, and by the
quantity of ferrous debris present (Figure V-1). If the sensor is close to a cluster of objects, their
signatures will register as complex; if far enough away, their signatures will register as simple. The
anomaly profiles also provided indications of confidence; for example, if there was very little random
noise on the magnetic profile, the amplitude measurement of each individual anomaly was likely to have
been highly accurate. Particular attention was paid to anomalies that indicated areas of high density, to
anomalies exhibiting complex magnetic signatures, to clusters of anomalies, and to anomalies of
unusually high amplitude and duration that were recorded on multiple transects. Magnetic anomalies were
evaluated based on the aforementioned characteristics. Contour mapping was used to ascertain the nature
of any features and the distribution of magnetic anomalies.
The sub-bottom profiler detects sediment horizons beneath the seabed and can help identify
paleolandforms that may have supported human habitation in the past. The identification of potentially
significant cultural resources from side scan sonar, magnetometer, and sub-bottom profiler records
involves correlation of data from across the entire remote sensing array.
The uses of magnetometers in archaeology and the theoretical aspects of their operation have
been summarized and discussed in detail by Breiner (1973), Hall (1970), Tite (1972), Weymouth (1986)
and Green (1990). Breiner (1973) explained how the inverse cube of distance (1/r³) affects the amplitude
of an anomaly (fall-off rate). He also discusses the concept of “closest approach” indicating additional
survey may need to be conducted to run the magnetometer directly “over” the object to accurately locate

55

A study by Enright et al. (2006) discussed the interpretive process for potential shipwreck
anomalies and draws conclusions on how shipwreck anomalies are dominated by “predictable dipolar
shapes” (Enright et al. 2006:135). Following Enright et al. (2006), in 2009 English Heritage
commissioned a theoretical study on magnetometer techniques to identify submerged archaeological sites
(Camidge et al. 2010). That study, which questioned Hall’s (1970) interpretation of magnetic data,
described how the direction of magnetization is largely defined by the degree of magnetic susceptibility:
the magnetization vector may not always align with the earth’s magnetic field, or with the long axis of the
target (Camidge et al. 2010: 39-40). Camidge et al. (2010) examines the suggestion that tracklines should
be run in a north-south direction, maximizing the magnetometer signal since dipole anomalies are claimed
to have a north-south orientation. While this will work for shipwrecks aligned within ±45º of magnetic
north, it excludes individual source anomalies representative of shipwreck debris (i.e., cannon).
Leveraging the work done by Enright et al. (2006), Gearhart (2011) developed a magnetic
anomaly discrimination model by assessing the magnetic data of 29 shipwrecks and numerous debris
anomalies. Using the smallest known shipwreck anomaly (an early nineteenth century wooden sailing
vessel [41CL92] which exhibited a magnetic signature of 191 nT covering an area of 1,580 m²), he
applied theoretical line spacing and direction to determine appropriate line spacing and direction for
anomaly detection. Gearheart argued that line spacing should be reduced to 20 m, but stated that this often
increases the amount of debris recorded as magnetic anomalies above 5 nT. Central to his model was the
determination of each anomaly’s magnetic moment; for an anomaly to be considered a potential cultural
resource, its magnetic moment should deviate no more that ±45º from magnetic north. The model was
designed to differentiate debris from shipwrecks, not the converse, and therefore, reduce the number of
potential cultural resources selected for additional survey, diver investigation, or avoidance.
RCG&A uses an in-house categorization to aid magnetic analyses in its initial review.
Amplitudes are classified as low (0-50 nT), medium (51-100 nT) and high (>100 nT), and durations are
divided into short (<67 ft), medium (67-201 ft) and long (>201 ft). Following the initial criteria, the
process is expanded to consider associated magnetic anomalies that may represent a single source and
include those that were previously excluded from the high amplitude/long duration criteria. The third step
is to examine magnetic anomalies that may not meet the high amplitude/long duration, but can be
associated with a compelling side scan sonar contact or subbottom anomaly or a charted or associated
shipwreck location. RCG&A carefully weighs all of these factors before determining whether an anomaly
should be called a target (i.e. a potential cultural resource). Some magnetic anomalies can be eliminated
from consideration if they are determined to represent utilities (i.e. submarine power cables) or
infrastructure (i.e. pipelines/platforms, etc.). Based on the examples provided, a number of potential
cultural resources would be missed by only applying a nT/duration criterion (Figure V-2).

Geometrics G-882 Marine Magnetometer. A Coda F190+ Octopus navigation system utilizing the Fugro
Starfix.HP Navigation Differential Service (NDS) provided horizontal positioning. There was a moderate
sea state during Surveyor’s operation, and winds ranged from 5 to 21 knots and seas ranged from 5 to 7
feet.
Bathymetry
Single beam bathymetric data collection revealed a bottom elevation of approximately -7 to -21 ft
(NAVD88). The seabed topography was fairly consistent and contained no significant features. In
general, a gradual bottom slope eastward and away from the shoreline was observed. No anthropogenic
seafloor disturbances or features were noted during review of bathymetric data. All bathymetric data were
gridded to a 50 cm bin size using a nearest neighbor algorithm. The contour data (Appendix II)
represented 1-ft. intervals and were not simplified or smoothed.
Magnetometer
An inventory of magnetic anomalies was compiled, and the profile of each was characterized in
terms of signature, amplitude, and duration. Particular attention was paid to anomalies that indicated areas
of high density, to anomalies exhibiting complex magnetic signatures, to clusters of anomalies, and to
anomalies of unusually high amplitude and duration that were recorded on multiple transects. The contour
map data assisted in visualizing and correlating anomaly characteristics (distribution and amplitude) and
relationships between paired anomalies on adjacent track lines. Magnetic survey data indicated
widespread distribution of magnetic anomalies throughout the survey area (Appendix IV). A number of
factors were weighed during target identification and evaluation including the overall complexity of
magnetic signatures, the amplitude and duration of anomalies that comprise them, and the spatial
distribution of anomalies across multiple transects. Spatial and magnetic contour analyses coupled with
careful review of each anomaly resulted in the identification of six complex, 88 dipole and 22 monopolar
anomalies. None of these anomalies correlated with recorded sonar contacts.
Side Scan Sonar
JCLS’ geophysical survey recorded high-resolution side scan sonar data throughout the Shallow
Water APE. Data review included individual high resolution line files and geo-referenced mosaics
(Appendix III). JCLS identified one side scan sonar contact, SW_1; however, miscellaneous, insignificant
debris from commercial waterborne activities, tidal deposition and storm effects is widespread throughout
the shallows. None of the contacts correlated with recorded magnetic anomalies. Images of all side scan

59

sonar contacts, unidentified/identified objects, including interpretive annotations, are available in
Appendix III.
Sub-bottom Profiler
Sub-bottom profiler data were not collected within the shallow water area.
Cultural Resources Areas of Interest (Targets)
Archaeological analyses of the remote sensing data revealed one target in the Shallow Water
APE: SW-001. It is representative of a shipwreck. Target SW-001 contains five anomalies: SW_24
(42.3γ/100.9´), SW_29 (108.3γ/194.2´), SW_31 (1841.9γ/318.9´), SW_32 (84.2γ/373.6´), and SW_35
(15.2γ/250.8´) (Figure V-3; Appendix III Map Sheet 2; Appendix IV: Map Sheet 2). The magnetometer
data indicated a significant source of ferrous materials (1,800 γ) within the surf zone and oriented along
the revised pipeline route. No sonar contact could be associated with these five anomalies. Further, the
data indicated that the source lies within 580 feet of a charted AWOIS and ENC wreck. That wreck, the
75-foot F/V Campesino (NOAA 2016: AWOIS #5824) was reported by the 8th Coast Guard District in
July 1983. The Coast Guard reported the vessel "aground with stern and mid-section underwater" (NOAA
2016). In 1989, the Coast Guard updated the listing and reported that there were no plans to salvage the
vessel (NOAA 2016). Campesino’s recorded location was reported cleared (negative results) by JCLS’
small boat operations during the shallow water survey.
Magnetic and spatial analyses indicate that Target SW-001 likely represents the wrecked
Campesino. Campesino is modern and does not constitute an historic resource. Although not positively
identified, this target will be avoided by a directional drill at depths of 75-100 feet below.
Deep Geophysical Survey Operations (>20 ft (6.1 m) Depth)
The Deepwater Area (APE) is located offshore Texas and extends from the Direct Pipe Exit point
in Block 1237-S to a point along the US-Mexico border within Block 1171-L, South Padre Island Area
(PS), Gulf of Mexico. The survey area for direct effects lies within Texas State Tracts 1169, 1170, 1188,
1224S, 1225S, 1226S, 1228S, 1229S, 1230S, 1231S, 1232S, 1234S, 1235S, 1236S, 1237S, 1238S, 1240S,
and 1242S. The geographic extent of the APE encompasses a 600-ft wide centerline corridor and up to a
6,000-ft wide anchor corridor within state waters. The vertical APE established within the centerline
corridor using the proposed pipeline depth, is a maximum of 9 ft below seabed. The vertical impact is
expected to be confined to shallow, near-surface sediments.

60

Fugro completed high-resolution geophysical survey (Phases I and II) in the Deepwater Area
aboard Fugro Enterprise on October 23, 2016 (Fugro 2016b). The survey array included: Reson SeaBat
7101 Multibeam Echotrac; EdgeTech 4200 Side Scan Sonar; SeaSpy Magnetometer; EdgeTech 3200
Sub-bottom Profiler; GeoAcoustics Boomer; and, a Geotechnical Box Corer. Horizontal positioning of
the survey vessel was accomplished using the Fugro Starfix.HP Differential Global Positioning System
(DGPS). Sea conditions during the survey varied, with winds ranging from five to 17 knots and seas
ranging from one to four feet (Fugro 2016b).
Magnetometer
An inventory of magnetic anomalies was compiled, and the profile of each was characterized in
terms of signature, amplitude, and duration. Again, particular attention was paid to anomalies that
indicated areas of high density, to anomalies exhibiting complex magnetic signatures, to clusters of
anomalies, and to anomalies of unusually high amplitude and duration that were recorded on multiple
transects. Contour map data assisted in visualizing and correlating anomaly characteristics (distribution
and amplitude) and the relationship between paired anomalies on adjacent track lines. Magnetic survey
data indicated widespread distribution of magnetic anomalies throughout the survey area (Appendix IV).
A number of factors were weighed during target identification and evaluation including the overall
complexity of magnetic signatures, the amplitude and duration of anomalies that comprise them, and the
spatial distribution of anomalies across multiple transects. Spatial and magnetic contour analyses coupled
with careful review of each anomaly resulted in the identification of 19 complex, 265 dipole and 421
monopolar anomalies within the Deepwater Area.
Side Scan Sonar
Fugro’s geophysical survey recorded high-resolution side scan sonar data throughout the
Deepwater APE. Data review included individual high resolution line files and geo-referenced mosaics
(Appendix III). Fugro identified 269 side scan sonar contacts; however, the majority represents
insignificant debris from commercial waterborne activities. Twenty-four of the contacts correlated with
recorded magnetic anomalies. Images of all side scan sonar contacts, unidentified/identified objects and
interpretive annotations are available in Appendix III).
Sub-bottom Profiler
Line-by-line analyses of sub-bottom profiler data were conducted to identify reflectors with
potential to represent areas that could contain significant submerged cultural resources. Acoustic
penetration of the CHIRP sub-bottom profiler averaged 12–20 ft (3.7-6.1 m) below mudline (BML)

62

(Fugro 2016b). Assessment of these data determined that acoustic penetration of the shallow subsurface
sediments reached as deep as 35 ft (10.7 m) BML; however, limited penetration (8-10 ft (2.4-3.0 m)) was
observed in several areas. The high frequency CHIRP data resolved to the full depth of the vertical APE.
Sub-bottom penetration was lessened in the nearshore portions of the Deepwater Area due to the ongoing
process of sand accretion in these areas.
Landscape features that potentially contain significant submerged cultural resources are those that
would have been suitable for supporting human populations, specifically natural levee and associated
environments flanking paleochannel systems. Hence, paleochannels were investigated through analysis of
the high-resolution CHIRP seismic data.
During post-processing, Fugro (2016b:10) characterized the sediment strata as laminar, even and
continuous with discontinuous truncated reworked channel beds and floodplain deposits. Shallow
subsurface features were noted and recorded sporadically throughout the Deepwater Area, indicating a
previously shifting fluvial environment. While sub-bottom reflectors were recognized that indicate buried
paleo-features, as described in Chapter 4 marine transgression and subsequent storm activity have eroded
and/or reworked these layers resulting in a low probability for preservation potential. In any event, all
subsurface features of potential interest for archaeological site preservation are located below the vertical
APE, and will not be impacted by the Project.
Charted Wrecks and Obstructions (Hazards)
NOAA Obstruction No. 9327. Charted Obstruction No. 9327 (NOAA 2016) consists of two
magnetic anomalies and one side scan sonar contact: 107 (1469.4γ /483.1´), 112 (464.0γ /487.0´), and
Sonar Contact No. 13 (Figure V-4; Appendix III; Appendix IV). Sonar Contact No. 13 depicts rectangular
debris, resembling grating, measuring 18.08 x 17.03 ft (5.5 x 5.2 m) with 2.62 ft of measurable relief.
NOAA’s (NCEI 1994) diver investigation revealed submerged jack up legs with 4.3 ft (1.3 m) of height
off the seabed (Figure V-5). Data correlations indicate that this target represents an abandoned jack up leg
or other modern marine equipment, rather than a cultural resource; therefore, it should be avoided as a
hazard.
NOAA Wreck No. 5823. Charted wreck 5823 (NOAA 2016) exhibits 18 magnetic anomalies and
one sonar contact: 123 (24γ/877´), 162 (63γ/936´), 164 (52γ/814´), 172 (167γ/1097´), 173 (166γ/738´),
175 (146γ/1233´), 181 (1072γ/1535´), 183 (178γ/1196´), 192 (303γ/1115´), 193 (325γ/1338´), 203
(162γ/1539´), 204 (451γ/1406´), 219 (185γ/852´), 222 (197γ/1145´), 230 (68γ/1166´), 231 (57γ/1078´),
242 (34γ/1472´), 243 (23γ/934´), and Contact No. 8 (Figure V-6; Appendix III; Appendix IV). Sonar
Contact No. 8 measures ~61 feet in length, and ~54 feet in width, with a height of less than one foot
above the seafloor. This contact is irregular in shape and represents the Transworld 45 wreckage. NOAA

65

(1994) listed the item as the Trans World 45, a semi-submersible drilling rig. On December 21, 1983, the
8th Coast Guard District reported that Transworld 45 had capsized and one of its 146 x 10-ft pontoons
was lost and adrift. The rig’s wreckage still was visible above the water in December of 1987, and it
subsequently was marked by a temporary lighted buoy. Nearly one year later, on September 27th, 1988,
Transworld 45 broke up and its wreckage scattered during Hurricane Gilbert. In 1994, NOAA reported
that a telephone conversation with Rick Ekstrom, a local diver and member of the Artificial Reef
Committee of Port Isabel and South Padre Island, described the wreckage as a grouping of twisted metal
boxes and platform legs (NCEI 1994). NOAA’s (NCEI 1994) diver investigation reported the remains of
a metal well platform (Figure V-7, which had settled on its side, surrounded by metal debris and
attachments, with a least depth of 8.3 meters. The first semi-submersible offshore drilling rigs appeared in
the Gulf of Mexico in the early 1960s. Trans World 45 is listed by the THC as Shipwreck No. 2199.
NOAA (1994) Target 2766.48. NOAA (1994) Target 2766.48 exhibits 14 magnetic anomalies and
one sonar contact: 413 (28γ/637´), 419 (252γ/805´), 447 (874γ/336´), 449 (5999γ/597´), 450 (597γ/562´),
452 (129γ/539´), 454 (47γ/539´), 464 (52γ/387´), 465 (191γ/463´), 466 (14323γ/394´), 468 (4463γ/682´),
471 (3742γ/697´), 472 (132γ/725´), 474 (44γ/653´), and Contact 14 (Figure V-8; Appendix III; Appendix
IV). Sonar Contact No. 14 measures ~120 feet in length, and 12 feet in width, with a height of ~1 foot
above the surrounding seafloor. This contact is rectangular in shape and represents man-made debris with
ferrous components. Fourteen magnetic anomalies are associated with the sonar contact. The object,
identified by NOAA (NCEI 1994) as Target 2766.48, was investigated further by divers (Figure V-9).
That investigation found a large area of concrete debris, with one section of concrete projecting 1.6
meters off the bottom (NCEI 1994:29). The object was not charted as an obstruction. The dimensions and
structure of the contact indicated that it represents modern debris, possibly associated with scrapping
activities, rather than a cultural resource; therefore, it should be avoided as a hazard.
Cultural Resources Areas of Interest (Targets)
Archaeological analyses of the remote sensing data revealed one target (DW-001) within the APE
that is representative of a probable shipwreck. Target DW-001 likely correlates with charted wreck 9328
(NOAA 2016); it contains six magnetic anomalies and one side scan sonar contact: 137 (8γ/440´), 645
(28γ/100´), 647 (25γ/113´), 649 (92γ/339´), 651 (1056γ/317´), 652 (902γ/314´) and Sonar Contact No.
141 (Figure V-10; Appendix III; Appendix IV). Sonar Contact No. 141 measures ~40 feet in length, and
~14.5 feet in width, with no measurable height above the surrounding seafloor. In 1992, NOAA (NCEI
1994) conducted a diver investigation that revealed the remains of a shrimp boat scattered over an area
measuring 11 x 17 meters (36 x 55 feet). The diver’s comments stated that the wood hull was gone, but
metal debris, including the propeller shaft, screw, outriggers and nets remained (Figure V-11).

Magnetic and spatial analyses indicate that this target represents the disarticulated wreck site that
NOAA (NCEI 1994) identified as the scattered remains of a shrimp boat. Since NOAA’s (NCEI 1994)
diver investigation in 1992, more extant wreck features have appeared on the seabed. This vessel is
modern and does not constitute an historic resource. Nevertheless, avoidance of Target DW-001 by 165 ft
(50.0 m) from the target’s extents during anchor handling is recommended to avoid fouling the anchor
cables, and to preserve this site for sport divers and fishermen.
Target BSP-001. Target BSP-001 is located outside the APE, adjacent to the Brazos Santiago
Pass Fairway. This target contains five magnetic anomalies: 485 (768.7γ/275´), 492 (52.1γ/306.2´), 562
(141.3γ/211.5´), 566 (1133.6γ/336.8´), and 570 (160.9γ/354.6´) detected across three adjacent survey
lines (Figure V-12; Appendix III: Map Sheet 1; Appendix IV: Map Sheet 1). Because the target is well
outside of the APE, there are no individual sonar bottom records available to review; however, the sonar
mosaic covered the target area with negative results. Magnetic contour analyses indicate that this target
exhibits the complex characteristics of a cultural resource. It will not be affected by anchor handling
within the 6000-ft wide anchoring corridor.
FERC Jurisdictional Area Under a Presidential Permit Application
The FERC APE for direct effects lies within Texas State Tracts 1170 and 1171. The geographic
extent of its APE encompasses a 300-ft wide centerline corridor and up to a 6,000-ft wide anchor corridor
within the maritime limits of waters of the U.S. The vertical APE established within the centerline
corridor using the proposed pipeline depth is a maximum of 9 ft below seabed. The vertical impact is
expected to be confined to shallow, near-surface sediments.
Fugro completed high-resolution geophysical survey within the FERC jurisdictional portion of
this area aboard Fugro Enterprise on October 21, 2016 (Fugro 2016b). The survey array included: Reson
SeaBat 7101 Multibeam Echotrac; EdgeTech 4200 Side Scan Sonar; SeaSpy Magnetometer; EdgeTech
3200 Sub-bottom Profiler; GeoAcoustics Boomer; and, a Geotechnical Box Corer. Horizontal positioning
of the survey vessel was accomplished with the Fugro Starfix.HP Differential Global Positioning System
(DGPS). Sea conditions during this portion of the survey were calm, with winds averaging five knots and
seas ranging from one to two feet (Fugro 2016b; Appendix V).
Bathymetry
The multibeam bathymetric data collected revealed bottom elevation of approximately -87.7 to 93.7 ft (NAVD88). The seabed topography was fairly consistent and contained no significant features. In
general a gradual bottom slope of approximately 3 degrees towards the southwest was observed. No

73

anthropogenic seafloor disturbances or features were noted during review of bathymetric data. All
bathymetric data were gridded to a 50 cm bin size using a nearest neighbor algorithm. The contour data
represented 1-ft intervals, and were not simplified or smoothed.
Magnetometer
An inventory of magnetic anomalies was compiled, and the profile of each was characterized in
terms of signature, amplitude, and duration. Particular attention was paid to anomalies that indicated areas
of high density, to anomalies exhibiting complex magnetic signatures, to clusters of anomalies, and to
anomalies of unusually high amplitude and duration that were recorded on multiple transects. The contour
map data assisted in visualizing and correlating anomaly characteristics (distribution and amplitude) and
the relationship between paired anomalies on adjacent track lines. Magnetic survey data indicated
widespread distribution of magnetic anomalies throughout the survey area (Appendix IV). A number of
factors were weighed during target identification and evaluation including the overall complexity of
magnetic signatures, the amplitude and duration of anomalies that comprise them, and the spatial
distribution of anomalies across multiple transects. Spatial and magnetic contour analyses coupled with
careful review of each anomaly resulted in the identification of six dipole and 75 monopolar anomalies.
No potential cultural resources were identified through magnetic analyses of the FERC Project APE.
Side Scan Sonar
Fugro’s geophysical survey recorded high-resolution side scan sonar data throughout the FERC
Project APE. Data review included individual high resolution line files and geo-referenced mosaics
(Appendix III). Fugro identified 25 side scan sonar contacts; however, the majority represent insignificant
debris from commercial waterborne activities. None of the contacts correlated with recorded magnetic
anomalies. Images of all side scan sonar contacts, unidentified/identified objects and interpretive
annotations are available in Appendix III. No potential cultural resources were identified during side scan
sonar analyses of the FERC Project APE.
Sub-bottom Profiler
Line-by-line analyses of sub-bottom profiler data were conducted to identify anomalies with
potential to represent areas that could contain significant submerged terrestrial cultural resources.
Acoustic penetration of the CHIRP sub-bottom profiler averaged 12–20 ft (3.7-6.1 m) below mudline
(BML) (Fugro 2016b). These data demonstrated that acoustic penetration of the shallow subsurface
sediments reached as deep as 35 ft (10.7 m) BML. The high frequency CHIRP data resolved to the full
depth of the vertical APE. During post-processing, Fugro (2016b:10) characterized the sediment strata as

75

laminar, even and continuous with discontinuous truncated reworked channel beds and floodplain
deposits. Shallow subsurface features were noted and recorded throughout the FERC area, indicating a
previously shifting fluvial environment. However, no buried paleo-features with the possibility for
preservation of in situ archaeological remains were recorded in the FERC Project APE. All subsurface
features of interest due to their potential for preservation are located well below the vertical APE and will
not be impacted by the Project.
Cultural Resources Areas of Interest (Targets)
No potential cultural resources were identified during analyses of the FERC Project APE.
Geomorphological Review
Sub-bottom Profiler
The project area resides along the barrier island coast and inner continental shelf of south Texas
(Figure V-13). The seafloor is generally smooth, but marked locally by subdued topographic features such
as stream channels, lagoons, and barrier beaches formed during periods of lower sea level (Martin and
Bouma 1978). Modern sediments consisting primarily of muds reflect reworking of the ancestral Rio
Grande River delta during Holocene sea-level rise (Holmes 2011). Refer to Chapter II for a detailed
description of the natural setting of the project area.
CHIRP data quality ranged from very good to marginal, but generally the quality was good
enough to decipher near surface paleochannels. CHIRP data extended 10-20 milliseconds (ms) (2-way
travel time), below the sea floor, which translates to ~7.5-15 meters below the sea floor (mbsf) using a
signal velocity of 1500 m/s in the mud-rich surface sediments. Although 1500 m/s is the velocity of the
signal in water, the velocity through surficial sediments is slightly higher. Because mud-rich sediments
likely have been fluidized (i.e., relatively low density), this increase is deemed inconsequential for the
purposes of this analysis. The time interval between event marks was not noted, but the distance between
event marks was ~125 m depending upon ship speed.
Based upon seismic reflection characteristics, numerous buried paleochannels were detected
throughout the project area. Criteria used to identify and distinguish paleochannels include evidence of
erosion/incision and/or truncation of underlying units along the base and/or flanks of the feature, and the
occurrence and nature of channel fill. The occurrence of basal erosional surfaces without other
distinguishing criteria may reflect processes other than channelization, but since this was not possible to
discern from available data, any features exhibiting channel-like characteristics were considered potential
paleochannels.

Three paleochannel types were identified in the project area based upon channel width, depth
below the sea floor, channel configuration, nature of the channel fill and thickness/character of the
overlying sedimentary units (Figures V-14 through V-17). The vast majority of buried paleochannels in
the project area, referred to here as Type 1, are relatively narrow (<500 m wide), shallow (<7.5 mbsf) and
generally v-shaped. Channel fill sequences were mostly acoustically transparent, but a few contained
horizontal strata. Type 1 paleochannels are commonly overlain by a thin (few meters at most) sediment
veneer that may be acoustically transparent, or that might contain parallel to sub-parallel and sometimes
high-amplitude internal reflectors.
Type 2 paleochannels (Figures V-15 and V-16) were broader, often in excess of 500 m in width,
and shallow (<7.5 mbsf), with a relatively flat basal surface. Fill sequences were acoustically transparent
or contained horizontal strata. Most were covered by a thin sediment veneer that may be acoustically
transparent or characterized by parallel to sub-parallel reflectors.
Type 3 paleochannels (Figure V-15b) were identified deeper in the subsurface, mostly between
10 and 20 ms (7.5-15 mbsf). Deeper channels generally were characterized by faint reflectors, but
appeared to have high angle flanks and transparent fill. As will be discussed below, deeper channels
mostly were confined to a small area on the northern margin of the west-east corridor ~5 km offshore
(Figure V-16).
Paleochannel Distribution
Paleochannels were found throughout the project area, but they appeared to be concentrated in
four separate areas (Figure V-18). Area I, located ~10-14 km offshore in the seaward most segment of the
E-W corridor, contained by far the highest density of paleochannels. Paleochannels were identified
throughout the entire width of the corridor from 200 Series and the seaward most segments of 100 Series
CHIRP data. Paleochannels essentially all were Type 1, and often occured as groups of narrow channels,
likely representing channel migration and/or multiple episodes of channel cutting while they were active
(Figure V-14). Most of the channel fill was acoustically transparent, although some contained parallel to
sub-parallel internal reflectors. Channel flanks were well defined and sediment cover was thin (<2 m),
making it difficult to resolve the presence of natural levees. The FERC Project APE is represented by
CHIRP lines 200-233, and it also contained numerous Type 1 paleochannels as described above.
Area II is located ~3-7 km offshore along the E-W corridor (Figure V-18). Most paleochannels
here lay along the southern margin of the corridor, and to a lesser extent in the central and northern
margins. Paleochannels in Area II were interpreted from 3000 and 4000 Series CHIRP data, and the
landward sections 100 Series data. 3000 Series CHIRP data contained primarily Type 3 paleochannels
(Figure V-15b) characterized by acoustically transparent fill, and covered by a 5-10 m thick sediment

78

900 Series data, and all were Type 1 (Figure V-17a). All contained acoustically transparent fill, and were
covered by very thin (<2 m) sediment veneer. 2000 Series paleochannels occupied the central portion in
the northernmost segment of the corridor and had the same characteristics as the 2000 Series
paleochannels described in Area III in that Types 1 and 2 were present, but both were poorly resolved and
inconclusive. Paleochannels detected from 6000 Series data were located seaward of 2000 Series
paleochannels. All were Type 1 and very similar to 900 Series paleochannels; however, reflectors were
very faint, likely due to marginal data quality (Figure V-17b).
A few isolated paleochannels were detected between Areas I and II, and between Areas III and IV
(Figure V-18). They include the only occurrence of Type 3 paleochannels along the northern margin of
the E-W corridor, in addition to the Type 3 paleochannels in Area II, also along the northern margin of
the E-W corridor (Figure V-18).
Potential for Preservation of Archeological Materials
As stated in Chapter II, the potential for in situ preservation of prehistoric archaeological features
and site in the study area is interpreted as a function of: the likelihood that cultural materials initially
existed and/or were introduced into the study area; and the potential for these materials to have been
preserved in the stratigraphic record.
CHIRP data displayed the presence of numerous paleochannels in the project area that likely
represent extensive channel cutting by stream/river channels associated with the ancestral Rio Grande
River during the last deglaciation starting ~20,000 ybp. The natural levees associated with these fluvial
systems would have been suitable sites for human activity, and cultural materials may have been
introduced into the system during this period.
The preservation potential of these cultural materials is heavily controlled by the rate of sea-level
rise and sediment input, with a fast sea-level rise and high sediment input favoring rapid burial and
preservation (Chapter II). In the project area, relatively slow rates of mid-late Holocene sea-level rise
coupled with reduced sediment input decrease the preservation potential. Additionally, shoreface
ravinement during the Holocene transgression likely planed off and/or reworked underlying sediments,
including natural levee deposits. This is supported by the thin sediment veneer overlying Types 1 and 2
paleochannels, as well as by the inability to resolve natural levee features in the CHIRP data. Hence the
preservation potential of cultural materials for Types 1 and 2 paleochannels in the project area, including
the FERC Project APE, is extremely low.
The highest probability for preservation of prehistoric archaeological components may be
associated with Type 3 paleochannels, because they are covered by up to ~10 m of sediment. However,
Type 3 paleochannels were rarely encountered and their stratigraphic position is likely lower than Types 1

82

and 2 paleochannels, which means they should be much older and not unlikely pre-dating human
occupation, although this cannot be confirmed with available data. Since Type 3 paleochannels often were
poorly defined, natural levees were not detected, so they also could have been destroyed or reworked
during a previous sea-level transgression similar to what has been described for Types 1 and 2
paleochannels. Additionally, Type 3 paleochannels were >7.5 mbsf, and they were well below the
project’s vertical APE confined to the northern margin of the E-W project corridor, so in the improbable
event that cultural materials were preserved and intact, they would not be disturbed by proposed project
activities.
Cultural Resources Assessment of Vibracore and Box Core Locations
In accordance with the Antiquities Permit Application and Authorization to Conduct Underwater
Archeology (Appendix VII), the geotechnical programs (Vibracore and box cores) were conducted by
Fugro within the centerline survey corridor at ≈±½ mile intervals along the offshore pipeline route
(starting at the Direct Pipe® exit and ending at the terminus at the USA-Mexico border). An 18 to 20-ft
(5.4-6.0 m) barrel capable of penetrating 16-ft (4.8 m) below the natural bottom or until refusal,
whichever was first, was used at the sample collection locations. Because the vessel, Enterprise was not
anchoring, RCG&A established a 30.48 m (100-ft) area of direct effects.
RCG&A reviewed the high-resolution geophysical (HRG) survey data acquired by Fugro within
the area of direct effects for each of the proposed Vibracore and Box Core sample locations (Table V-1).
The analyses considered all portions of the seafloor within the limits where bottom disturbing activities
were likely to occur. RCG&A’s QMA recorded that no potential archaeological resources would be
affected by the proposed geotechnical sampling activities (Appendix VI).
Enterprise served initially as the platform to conduct Box Core operations from October 19-20,
2017. Because of deteriorating weather and sea conditions, concerns were raised about the ability to keep
Enterprise on station for the vibracore operations. Since Enterprise’s it is not a DP vessel, Fugro
mobilized Fugro Americas on October 27 to execute the vibracore operations.
Coring operations aboard Fugro Americas occurred from October 28 to November 1, 2016. The
geotechnical equipment included a P-5 Electric Vibracorer. Horizontal positioning of the survey vessel
was accomplished with the Fugro Starpack differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Sea
conditions during this portion of the survey were moderate, with winds ranging from five to 21 knots and
seas ranging from five to seven feet. Fugro reported that the geotechnical analyses at the core locations,
revealed seafloor sediments consisting of brown, silty fine sand to olive gray clay to the depth of core
penetration (Fugro 2016b).

CHAPTER VI

CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
OPTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Valley Crossing Pipeline will provide natural gas to the Comisión Federal de Electricidad
for use in natural gas-fired electric generation plants. The project will allow transportation of natural gas
from a compressor station near Agua Dulce in Nueces County, Texas, to a tie-in point with the Sur de
Texas-Tuxpan Pipeline on the International Boundary between the United States and Mexico in offshore
waters, approximately 9 nautical miles (nm) off the Texas coast near Brownsville, Texas. The offshore
portion of the proposed 42-inch diameter pipeline will be emplaced approximately 14 linear miles in
length from the beach crossing entry to the Gulf of Mexico via a Direct Pipe® installation under the
shoreline to its tie-in point on the U.S.-Mexico border.
R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc. conducted the archaeological assessment of marine
geophysical and geotechnical data and evaluated the project area for the presence of submerged cultural
resources. The proposed Project corridor, located in state waters, has an area footprint of 716.17 acres
289.8 hectares). The marine geophysical survey acquired approximately 1,223 linear nautical miles (2,265
kilometers) of transect data during survey from 15 September to 18 October, 2016. A geotechnical
program (Vibracore and box cores) was conducted from October 28 to November 1, 2016, to ground truth
the previously collected geophysical survey data.
Archaeological assessment of the marine geophysical survey data revealed only three targets that
exhibit the characteristics of submerged cultural resources: Targets SW-001, DW-001 and BSP-001.
Target SW-001 likely represents the wrecked fishing vessel Campesino. This nearshore target will be
avoided by a deep directional drill; it will not be affected by project activities. Target DW-001 is
associated with charted wreck 9328 (NOAA 2016), a disarticulated shrimp boat. Although likely too
recent to constitute a historic resource, avoidance of this target is recommended during anchor handling
activities. Target BSP-001 is located well outside of the project APE, adjacent to the Brazos Santiago
Pass Fairway. Although it exhibits the characteristics of a submerged/buried cultural resource, it will not
be affected by project activities. The avoidances for Targets SW-001, DW-001 and BSP-001 extend to
this and other subsequent projects that may occur in this area, unless additional investigation by a
85

qualified archaeologist validates these targets are modern and not historic sites. Finally, geotechnical
survey data revealed numerous paleochannels at depths well below the project’s vertical APE. No buried
paleo-features with the possibility for cultural resource preservation were recorded in the Project’s
vertical APE.

Therefore, a determination of “No historic properties affected” (36 CFR 800.4) is

recommended.
A Plan for the Unanticipated Discovery of Historic Properties and Human Remains during
Construction defines procedures to be implemented in the event that previously unreported cultural
resources or human remains are found during construction of the Valley Crossing Pipeline Project
(Appendix VIII). Copies of this plan will be on-site during construction, and construction field
management and environmental inspectors will be trained in the requirements and application of this plan.

Scope of Work

1.0

PROJECT INTRODUCTION

R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc. (RCG&A), and Valley Crossing Pipeline, LLC (Valley
Crossing) are pleased to submit this Scope of Work for a submerged cultural resources investigation to be
performed in support of the Valley Crossing Pipeline Project, in Cameron County, Texas. Hazards
Survey, geotechnical and environmental data will be collected for engineering and archeological
assessment across a corridor centered along the offshore portion of the proposed pipeline route as shown
on Figure 1.
Valley Crossing is participating in a project to provide natural gas to the Comisión Federal de
Electricidad (CFE) for use in natural gas-fired electric generation plants. The project includes the
transportation of natural gas from a compressor station near Agua Dulce in Nueces County, Texas to a tiein point with the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan Pipeline on the International Boundary between the United States
and Mexico in offshore waters, approximately 9 nautical miles off the Texas coast near Brownsville,
Texas. The offshore portion of the proposed 42-inch diameter pipeline is approximately 9 linear miles in
length from the point that the pipe crosses the beach and enters the Gulf of Mexico via a Direct Pipe®
installation under the shoreline to the tie-in point on the Texas/Mexico border.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the
Rivers and Harbors Act, is the lead federal agency for the proposed project pursuant to their jurisdiction
over wetlands and water bodies. As such, the project will be subject to review under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (16 USC 470) (NHPA) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR
800). Additionally, this work will require review under the Antiquities Code of Texas, which protects
archeological and historic sites on state and local public property and requires the issuance of an
Antiquities Permit. This Scope of Work is being submitted for review and comment. Valley Crossing is
also applying to FERC for a Presidential permit in accordance with Executive Order 11423, as amended,
for the U.S.-Mexico border crossing.
This detailed Scope of Work describes the survey methods and approach for performing submerged
cultural resources assessment of survey data collected for the offshore portion of the proposed pipeline
project. Valley Crossing will collect survey data from the seafloor within the centerline and anchor survey
corridors necessary to finalize a pipeline route and to submit a Hazards Survey report, Geotechnical report
and Cultural Resources report for this project. The submerged cultural resources survey (Hazards Survey
and geotechnical investigations) will comply with applicable State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO)
standards and guidelines (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 28, Rule 28.6). RCG&A is
the cultural resources contractor for the project. As shown in Figure 1, the pipeline exits the Direct Pipe®
borehole in approximately 16-ft. water depth and terminates at the USA-Mexico border in approximately
89-ft. water depth. The preliminary offshore pipeline route information is shown on the project locator
map (Figure 1). Prior to initiating offshore field work, Valley Crossing, in consultation with the survey
contractor (to be determined), will provide a final basic pipeline route.

Scope of Work

The Scope of Work has been defined in a multiphase approach outlined below:
Phase 1 – Preliminary Pipeline Centerline Survey
Phase 2 – Detailed Pipeline Hazards Survey and Report
•
•

2A – Offshore Pipeline Survey
2B – Geotechnical Report

Phase 3 – Geotechnical Survey
•
•
•

3A –Vibracore Collection Program
3B – Laboratory Testing Program
3C – Geotechnical Report and Cultural Resource Assessment of Boring Locations

Phase 4 – Optional ROV/Diving Survey
Although the Scope of Work is defined sequentially, tasks will overlap or be performed in an order that
results in the most efficient sequence. Track line layouts will be developed for each survey phase prior to
conducting field work; the survey contractor will submit a finalized survey plan, which will be sent to the
appropriate agencies for review and comment. Phases of the Hazards Survey and geotechnical work (as
related to cultural resources) will adhere to any conditions specified by the Texas Antiquities Permit.
1.1

Impact of Proposed Offshore Pipeline Construction

New 42-inch diameter steel pipe will be concrete-coated for negative buoyancy control before
installation. The pipeline will be fabricated and laid on the seafloor using a pipe lay barge. During
construction, the anchor corridor may be up to 2,000 ft. each side of centerline or 4,000 ft. total. The
pipeline then will be buried by jetting, which uses high pressure water and air eductors to create a trench
directly under the pipeline by emulsifying the soils and temporarily dispersing the trench spoil into the
water column. The final cover, which is the distance between the top of the pipeline and the natural
seabed, will be at least 3 ft (0.9 m), resulting in a total trench depth of at least 7.5 ft (2.3 m). The trench
width will be dependent upon the soil characteristics and will be determined by the geotechnical
investigation results.
Construction impacts at the crossing of the beach will be avoided through use of the Direct Pipe® boring
construction method, which is similar to the more familiar horizontal directional drilling (HDD)
construction method, with a reduced potential for drilling fluid frac-outs. The approximate location of the
Direct Pipe® exit point is identified on Figure 1.
1.2

Project Schedule

Valley Crossing plans to initiate the Hazards Survey upon issuance of the Texas Antiquities Permit.
Based on the estimated size of the survey area (i.e., the number of transects) for the Phase 1 and Phase 2
surveys and the time estimated to conduct the planned geotechnical investigations, the estimated schedule
is provided in Table 1. Valley Crossing assumes the surveys will be performed as a 24-hour-per-day
operation.

In accordance with best practices, bottom disturbing activities will not commence until the project team
has reviewed the relevant survey data and confirmed that there are no potentially sensitive cultural
resources (i.e. shipwrecks, paleo landscapes) at a given site. The Hazards Survey program is anticipated
to commence once the Phase I survey is complete. The schedule will allow adequate time to conduct a
complete review of the survey data and the time between completion of the survey and initiation of Phase
3 (the geotechnical program) will be dependent upon the geotechnical vessel’s schedule.
1.3

Project Administration

RCG&A’s Senior Nautical Archeologist, James S. Schmidt, M.A., will serve as Principal Investigator
(PI) and will direct cultural resources investigation activities. Mr. Schmidt’s Curriculum Vita is provided
with the application form. Benjamin Wells, M.A., Nautical Archeologist will serve as the project’s
Geoarcheologist with the assistance of RCG&A consultant, Gregg Brooks, Ph.D., Professor of Marine
Science Eckerd College, who will serve as the project’s Geomorphologist. Nautical Archeologists
Kathryn Ryberg, M.Sc., and Kara Davis, M.A., will assist with the research, data analyses and report
preparation tasks.
The qualifications of the RCG&A professional nautical archeological staff meet or exceed the federal
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management requirements that a Qualified Marine Archeologist meet the
Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications Standards (36 CFR 61 Appendix A) and have
experience in conducting high-resolution marine geophysical (HRG) survey, processing and interpreting
the resulting data for archeological potential producing a stand-alone report based on the high resolution
Hazards Survey data.
All archeological work will be performed in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended; the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974; and Title 36 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and 800, as appropriate. Additionally, this work will comport with
standards set forth in the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic
Preservation (48 FR 44738-44739); the Antiquities Code of Texas; and the Texas Administrative Code
(Title 13).
1.4

Cultural Resources Assessment (Data Analyses)

Detailed cultural resources analyses will be conducted of all remote sensing data. All data will be
analyzed using currently acceptable scientific methodologies. Submerged cultural resources include
shipwrecks and disposal sites, and submerged prehistoric and historic archeological sites. These objects
and deposits normally can be detected with a remote sensing array that includes a marine magnetometer,
side scan sonar, and a subbottom profiler. Side scan sonar records are analyzed to help distinguish
topographic features of the seabed and any objects protruding above the bottom sediments. The
interpretation of side scan sonar records involves recognition of any distinct patterns indicating projection
or depressions, and descriptions of all sonar contacts, including measurements such as length, area and
approximate height above seabed. For archeological materials (e.g. shipwrecks), higher side scan
frequencies and shorter ranges increase the likelihood of detecting older sites with small acoustic profiles.
Magnetic data collected during survey will be examined carefully following post processing. For each

4

Scope of Work

magnetic anomaly, the profile will be examined to determine amplitude, duration, signature (monopole,
dipole or complex) and areal distribution (detectable over multiple track lines). Contour mapping will be
used to ascertain the nature of any features and the distribution of magnetic anomalies. The subbottom
profiler detects sediment horizons beneath the seabed and can help identify paleolandforms that may have
supported human habitation in the past. The identification of potentially significant cultural resources
from side scan sonar, magnetometer and subbottom profiler records will involve correlation of data from
across the entire remote sensing array.
All data will be correlated via DGPS position data and plotted via ArcGIS. Magnetometer and
bathymetric data will be contoured via ArcGIS 3D Analyst to provide visual aids for interpretation.
Remote sensing data then will be correlated with a variety of shipwreck databases, geomorphic and
historical research results, nautical charts, and any observations noted in survey logs during data
collection.
1.5

Marine Background Research

Background Research will focus on the development of environmental and cultural contexts for the
overall project area and will involve a review of previous cultural resource investigations and inventories
of identified historic properties and submerged cultural resources (pre-and post-contact period) within the
proposed project area.
Research will include a review of readily available historical maps, aerial photographs, cultural resources
survey reports and other relevant public records, as well as examination of the site file records at the THC
and/or the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
Database, and include the National Register of Historic Places files. Additionally, background research
will include a review of the Office of Coast Survey’s Wrecks and Obstructions database (NOAA 2016),
the Office of Coast Survey's Historical Map & Chart Collection, and the National Centers for
Environmental Information (NCEI) to review hydrographic survey data and products. The intent of this
literature search and records review will be to determine the location of all previously recorded
archeological sites, shipwrecks, historic standing structures, historic cemeteries, and National Register
properties positioned within or immediately adjacent to the project area. This information will be used to
develop the archeological context for assessing and subsequently avoiding any cultural resources that may
lie within the areas under examination.
1.6

Cultural Resources Reporting

Based on our assessment of the Hazards Survey data, a recommendation of significance will be offered if
possible for all newly recorded archeological sites identified as a result of this survey. These assessments
will apply the NRHP Criteria for Evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [A-D]). Following the survey a draft cultural
resources report will be prepared that presents the results of this investigation; it will contain appendices
including official State of Texas Archeological Site Data Forms, project correspondence with review
agencies and resumes of key personnel. The report will be prepared in accordance with the Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) and Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) guidelines.
1.7

Curation

After the final report has been accepted, all drawings, maps, photographs, and field notes will be curated
with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, J.J. Pickle Research Campus, Bldg. 5, The University
of Texas at Austin, 10100 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758.

Previous Investigations/Background Research

1.8.1

Charted Wrecks and Obstructions

A review of NOAA Nautical Chart 11301 (26th ed., Nov. 2013) revealed two charted obstructions, one
artificial reef and one wreck located within the proposed offshore Survey Area (Figure 2; Table 2). One
obstruction (NOAA 2013), identified as a fish haven, consists of production platforms, vessels, and other
materials used to establish an artificial reef (NOAA 2016: 8151). The second obstruction is a 2 x 2-m
metal box ground-truthed by NOAA divers.
The charted wreck (NOAA 2016: 9328) is described as submerged and a danger to surface navigation.
Side scan sonar survey and diver investigation revealed the remains of a shrimp boat scattered over an 11
x 17-m area. The least depth (20.7 m / 68 ft) was recorded on one of the vessel’s propeller blades rising
1.3 m off the bottom.

Previous Submerged Cultural Resources Investigations

A brief review was undertaken of previously completed submerged cultural resources investigations,
previously recorded marine archeological site locations, and previously reported historic shipwrecks
situated within 1.0 mile (1.6 km) of the proposed project right-of-way (Table 3). That review, which
examined data stored electronically on the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas, resulted in the identification of 12 previously conducted marine projects in Cameron County.
However, all 12 surveys lacked corresponding full report abstracts in the atlas database. For 10 of the 12
surveys, the sponsoring agency was present. Such sponsoring agencies included the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, (n=7), the Texas Department of Transportation (n=1), the THC (n=1), and the Colonial
Pipeline (n=1). When Project Type was present, Investigations accounted for three of the projects; Survey
accounted for nine of the projects. No recommendations were present on any of the 12 examined surveys.
Prior to completion of the Phase I cultural resources survey, an appointment will be secured to acquire
and analyze the unabstracted reports.

Previously Reported Shipwrecks

Thirty-nine shipwrecks are listed in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Table 4) in proximity to the
APE. Twenty-two of those wrecks listed do not have latitude/longitude. The closest recorded shipwreck
for the project area is Boca Chica No. 1 (41CF125), located in the proposed survey corridor. Because all
of the shipwrecks, with the exception of Boca Chica No. 1 (41CF125), are reported and unverified they
are not considered actual archeological sites (Amy A. Borgens 2016, pers. comm.).

PHASE 1 – PRELIMINARY PIPELINE CENTERLINE SURVEY

The intent of this phase is to ensure there are no obvious obstacles or “fatal flaws” within the selected
centerline corridor that would encumber the permitting process (e.g., seabed features, shipwrecks, etc.) or
the constructability of the pipeline (abrupt topographic changes, exposed rock, etc.). Data collected during
Phase 1 will be field verified in accordance with RCG&A’s data transfer protocols. RGC&A will analyze
the data for cultural resources and provide a summary of findings in near real time.
This phase involves the collection of data, processing and evaluation of data in field, followed by
additional in-field investigations of any identified concerns as warranted. Phase 1 will be completed when
the project team can finalize a single pipeline route whereby the more detailed investigation identified in
Phase 2 can be performed.
The activities identified below will be performed concurrently, wherever possible. A USBL (Ultra-short
Baseline) positioning system will be deployed for any of the deep towed equipment to ensure accuracy of
collected information.
2.1

Data Collection

During the Phase 1 survey of the primary route (Figures 1 and 2), a qualified marine archeologist will be
on the vessel. The data collected during the seafloor survey operation will include magnetometer, subbottom profiler, side scan sonar, and multibeam echo sounding data for each segment of the route.
The data collection process for Phase 1 will obtain center-line data along the primary route. The real time
evaluation of this data by the Valley Crossing Representative, in addition to input from the survey
contractor’s on-site geophysicists, will be utilized to make recommendations to the project team for the
eventual selection of the final route.
The data collected will be field processed and incorporated into the evaluation process. Additional data
collection will be performed to identify the most favorable route.
2.1.1

Sub-bottom Profiler

The sub-bottom data will be collected with a CHIRP system capable of achieving a vertical bed
separation of at least 1-ft. in the uppermost 30 to 50-ft. of sediments, depending on substrate. These data
will be utilized to develop a stratigraphic profile along the route to a depth of 16 ft. below
seafloor/seabed. Confidence checks will include verification that the unit is both transmitting and
receiving signals, accurate positioning information is being input to the system via the GPS interface, that
data logging is fully functional, etc.
A boomer system will be deployed during the collection of sub-bottom data. The boomer system will be
capable of penetrating greater than 30 ft. beyond any potential disturbance depth with a vertical resolution
of at least 10 ft. The Phase 1 survey is intended to collect center-line corridor data only.
2.1.2

Side Scan Sonar

Side scan sonar with a minimum 300 kHz frequency will be run at a 150-ft. range during Phase 1 to
maximize seafloor coverage while maintaining resolution. The sonar will be towed above the seafloor at a
distance that is 10-20% of the range of the instrument. Side scan imagery will be utilized to determine
seabed geomorphology, assist with surficial sediment type identification, and identify surface
obstructions. Positioning system confidence checks will be performed daily to ensure proper equipment

11

Scope of Work

functionality; sonar confidence checks will be performed by towing side scan sonar over known objects
(such as a navigational buoy block) to verify presence on sonar imagery.
2.1.3

Hydrographic Survey

Hydrographic data will be used to generate depth profiles along the centerline. The multibeam system will
produce data with a resolution of at least 1.5 ft. in water depths shallower than 150 ft. and 3 ft. or better
than 2% of water depth resolution in water depths beyond 150 ft. Contours will be defined by 1-ft.
intervals with the 10-ft. intervals more prominently shown. Shaded relief images will also be used in lieu
of or in addition to contours. The primary objective of this data in Phase 1 is to correlate the seafloor
shape with other data collected and to measure abrupt changes in the seafloor slope.
2.1.4

Magnetometer Survey

A magnetometer will collect data within the centerline corridor to identify buried hazards. The track line
spacing will run parallel to the centerline at 65-ft. intervals throughout the centerline corridor in
accordance with the Texas Administrative Code requirements. A marine magnetometer will be deployed
that has a sensitivity of ≤1.0 nanotesla (nT) peak to peak. Background noise will not exceed 3.0 nT peak
to peak. The sampling rate will be greater than 4.0 Hz. Survey line, time, position, altitude and speed will
be included on all output data. The magnetometer altitude will not exceed 20 ft. off of the seafloor.
2.1.5

Ponar Grab Samples

Ponar grab samples will be collected to confirm (ground truth) the interpretation of electronic survey data.
Samples will be collected every 0.5 mi. along the centerline. Information derived from the samples will
be discussed in the Hazards Survey report. This information will be documented in a manner that clearly
demonstrates what was observed in the samples, including pictures and written assessments.
2.2

Vessel Communications

The survey contractor will make radio contact with any approaching vessels over VHF radio. The vessel
also will display day shapes indicating restricted ability to maneuver during daylight hours.
2.3

Phase 1 Data Processing and Deliverables

As data is collected and processed during Phase 1, the on-board Valley Crossing Representative and
RCG&A’s PI will be provided real-time access to survey results. The survey contractor also will make
information available for review by on-shore project team members to aid in route selection. Team
meetings and/or teleconferences will be convened to review data and to select the final alignment. The
survey contractor will transfer electronically all offshore survey data and geotechnical referenced data and
*.dwg files for Valley Crossing to review. Following this review, Valley Crossing will approve and
authorize any/all additional work and the final route selected. During that time, it is expected that the
vessel will be used to collect grab samples to characterize the previously collected survey data. Once a
final route has been selected, the survey contractor will develop a brief report that outlines the Phase 1
survey and its results. The report will include details of the survey equipment and procedures deployed.

PHASE 2 - DETAILED OFFSHORE PIPELINE SURVEYS

Phase 2 is a detailed archeological, engineering and Hazards Survey of the proposed route selected from
Phase 1 survey operations. Activities identified below will be performed concurrently, wherever possible.
The data collection for the Phase 2 survey is subdivided into two separate areas along the pipeline route,
namely the centerline survey corridor and the anchor survey corridor as defined in Table 5. Valley
Crossing will develop a drawing that identifies the preliminary pipeline route and additional anchor
corridor areas required for construction.

Phase 2 – Offshore Pipeline Survey Area Data Collection

The requirements of the offshore survey operation will include sub-bottom data, side scan data,
magnetometer data and bathymetric data of the seafloor. The survey contractor may elect to use a USBL
system for any of the towed equipment to ensure accuracy of collected information. Details of the data
collection requirements are defined below. Any modifications to improve the overall survey program or
enhance the data collection will be implemented as warranted. All data collection activities will adhere to
the minimum standards and guidelines specified in the Texas Administrative Code (Title 13, Part 2, and
Chapter 28). The data will be transferred to RCG&A in accordance with standard data transfer protocols
(Attachment A).
3.1.1

Sub-bottom Profiler

The sub-bottom data will be collected with a CHIRP system capable of achieving a vertical bed
separation of at least 1 ft. in the uppermost 30 to 50 ft. of sediments, depending on substrate. These data
will be utilized to develop a stratigraphic profile along the route to a depth of 16 ft. below
seafloor/seabed. Confidence checks will include verification that the unit is transmitting and receiving
signals, that accurate positioning information is being input to the system via the GPS interface, and that
data logging is fully functional.
A boomer system will be deployed during the collection of sub-bottom data. The boomer system should
be capable of penetrating greater than 30 ft. beyond any potential disturbance depth, with a vertical
resolution of at least 10 ft.

3.1.2

Side Scan Sonar

Side scan sonar with a minimum 300 kHz frequency will be the deep tow system that will be run at a 150ft. range during Phase 1 to maximize seafloor coverage while maintaining resolution. The sonar will be
towed above the seafloor at a distance that is 10-20% of the range of the instrument. Side scan imagery
will be utilized to determine seabed geomorphology, to assist with surficial sediment type identification,
and to identify surface obstructions. Positioning system confidence checks will be performed daily to

Hydrographic Survey

Hydrographic data will be used to generate depth profiles along the centerline. The multibeam system will
produce data with a resolution of at least 1.5 ft. in water depths shallower than 150 ft. and 3 ft. or better
than 2% of water depth resolution in water depths beyond 150 ft. Contours will be defined by 1-ft.
intervals with the 10-ft. intervals shown more prominently. Shaded relief images also will be used in lieu
of or in addition to contour mapping. The primary objective of this data in Phase 2 are to correlate the
seafloor shape with other data collected and to measure abrupt changes in the seafloor slope.
Hydrographic data collected in the centerline survey corridor will be obtained by using multibeam echo
sounding technology. Hydrographic data collected in the anchor survey corridor will be obtained with the
use of single beam echo sounders.
The bathymetric data will be used to generate depth profiles along the proposed alignment(s). Contours
will be defined by 1-ft. intervals with the 10-ft. intervals more prominently shown. DGPS will be used for
horizontal positioning of all survey vessels. A RTK (Real Time Kinematics) GPS base station will be
established for the Phase 2 survey operation. This device will provide an elevation component that will be
used to account for tidal adjustments.
3.1.4

Magnetometer Survey

A magnetometer will collect data within the centerline corridor to identify buried hazards. The track line
spacing will run parallel to the centerline at 65-ft. intervals throughout the pipeline corridor in accordance
with Texas requirements. A marine magnetometer will be deployed that has a sensitivity of ≤1.0 nT peak
to peak. Background noise will not exceed 3.0 nT peak to peak. The sampling rate will be greater than 4.0
Hz. Survey line, time, position, altitude and speed will be included on all output data. The magnetometer
altitude will not exceed 20 ft. off of the seafloor.
3.1.5

Cultural Resource Assessment

RCG&A will inspect the real time collection of survey data for the purposes of evaluating cultural
resource issues. If changes to the present program are required, Valley Crossing will provide
authorization prior to the implementation of any requested changes.
In accordance with the Texas Administrative Code (Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26, Subchapter A), the PI
will remain on site for a minimum of 25 per cent of the time required to complete field investigations.
3.2

Phase 2B – Hazard Survey Report

The survey contractor will provide Valley Crossing and RCG&A a copy of the detailed Hazards Survey
report. That report will include detailed descriptions of the survey equipment, procedures, and any

14

Scope of Work

conditions (i.e., course changes, sea state, weather, etc.) that may impact the accuracy of the data. This
report also will provide tables describing the magnetometer and side scan targets. Data collection
procedures (including calibration procedures) and descriptions of post-processing procedures will be
included. Final drawings and other graphics will be included in this report.
4.0

PHASE 3 – GEOTECHNICAL PROGRAM

The geotechnical program will commence once the core locations have been permitted and cleared of
potential cultural resources. Documentation clearing the core locations will be provided by RCG&A as an
appendix within the cultural resources report. Phase 3A of the geotechnical program is comprised of both
box core and vibracore sample collection in the field along the pipeline route followed by the laboratory
analysis of the box core and vibracore sample. Phase 3A samples will be collected within the centerline
survey corridor at ±½ mile intervals along the offshore pipeline route (starting at the Direct Pipe® exit
and ending at the terminus at the USA-Mexico border) and at locations beneficial to ground-truth the
previously collected survey data or to satisfy the cultural resources requirements. Phase 3B specifies the
geotechnical laboratory testing requirements for the engineering properties of the soil.
4.1

Cultural Resources Assessment of Vibracore Locations

All core locations (and associated anchor spreads) will require cultural resources assessment prior to
initiation of the geotechnical program. RCG&A will leverage data collected during the Phase 1 or Phase 2
survey to provide a cultural resources assessment of the proposed locations and to identify any surface or
near surface potential cultural resources providing avoidance recommendations as needed. Valley
Crossing will provide RCG&A the proposed sample locations and anchor spreads. RCG&A may also
identify buried features in the sub-bottom data that may contain preserved archeological materials and
recommend collecting geotechnical samples to confirm the presence or absence of soil horizons, thereby
resolving whether these surfaces need to be avoided during construction. To achieve these objectives,
geotechnical cores planned for engineering may be co-located to support the archeological analysis.
4.2

Phase 3A - Sample Collection Program

Information collected during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 surveys will be used to refine and revise the sample
collection locations (Tables 6 and 7). The vibracore equipment will be capable of penetrating 16 ft. below
natural bottom. The soils sample collected from the vibracore will be evaluated from an engineering
perspective to ground-truth the previously collected survey data. The vibracore will penetrate to the
desired depth or to refusal, whichever is reached first. “Refusal” is defined as 3 minutes of vibration with
less than 6 inches of penetration.
RCG&A will coordinate with Valley Crossing during the planning for sample collection and, to the extent
possible, incorporate the relevant results of the collection program into the archaeological analysis. The
proposed sample collection program will inform and serve as “ground-truthing” of the archaeological
interpretation of the sub-bottom (CHIRP) profiler data and aid in the identification of areas where
submerged and buried archaeologically sensitive paleolandforms (i.e., the margins of rivers, streams,
lakes, ponds and wetlands, terraces, floodplains, upland areas, etc.) may be present.

Phase 3B – Sample Laboratory Analysis Program

The Laboratory Analysis program specifies the minimum requirements for the geotechnical investigation
required for ground-truthing the Phase 1 and 2 data developed along the pipeline route. The work includes
interaction and discussion with the offshore survey company. RCG&A may be involved in the
discussions for sampling and testing if additional information is required to support analyses of the area’s
potential archeological sensitivity for buried archaeological sites.
The survey contractor will include the results of the laboratory analyses in the final Geotechnical Report.
A Core Log format depicting the results of the testing performed on each core will be provided for review
and approval by Valley Crossing. Following approval of the testing results, copies of all core logs used to
inform the archaeological interpretation of paleolandscape features will be included as an appendix in the
cultural resources report.
4.4

Phase 3C - Geotechnical Report

The final Geotechnical Report will include information such as a review of local geology including
expected conditions, characteristics and applicable geologic mechanisms. RCG&A will incorporate the
relevant results of the Geotechnical Report into the cultural resources report to support assessing the
potential presence of archaeological deposits including pre-contact period Native American submerged
cultural resources.
5.0

OPTIONAL ROV / DIVING SURVEY

Valley Crossing may perform a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) video survey along the centerline of the
final (Phase 2) alignment for the purposes of characterizing “hard bottom” areas and for the assessment of
potential archeological target investigations. If the ROV work is used to ground-truth archeological
targets, RCG&A’s PI will be aboard during this survey and will contribute to the ROV survey plan. Any
ROV plan for ground-truthing cultural resources will be submitted to the appropriate agencies for review
and comment prior to implementation. The ROV plan to investigate archeological targets will be
submitted with a new (or amended) Texas Antiquities Permit prior to initiating the survey.

16

Scope of Work

In the event diving operations are required to ground-truth cultural resources, diving on these targets will
be performed by RCG&A’s Nautical Archeologists employing a commercial surface supplied diving
(SSD) system. Dive operations plans will be planned with the vessel contractor and submitted to the
appropriate agencies for review and comment to ensure the data captured are sufficient for their review
requirements.
Depending on location and water depth, the cultural and/or archeological resource investigation may
involve the use of the ROV or the use of the survey vessel as a shallow water SSD diving platform. In
accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code (Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 28, Rule 28.6), “Survey level
diving investigations must be approved as part of the survey permit issued to the archeologist or as a
separate survey permit.” If needed, archeological diving investigations can be provided under a separate
scope of work.

UNANTICIPATED DISCOVERY PLAN
Valley Crossing Pipeline Project
Offshore Cameron County, Texas
INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Valley Crossing LLC (Valley Crossing), R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.
(RCG&A) has prepared the following Unanticipated Discovery Plan with the intent to demonstrate
compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations concerning cultural resources and
human remains; to describe to regulatory and review agencies the procedures that will be followed in the
event of unanticipated discoveries; and to provide guidance to Valley Crossing Pipeline Project (Project)
personnel. The federal laws that govern cultural resources and human remains include but are not limited
to the following, particularly 36 CFR Part 800 the regulations that implement Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1996, as amended; 36 CFR Part 61; Section 3(d) (U.S.C. § 3002) of the
Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. §§ 3001-3013); and the
Archaeological Resource Protection Act (Public Law 96-95, 16 U.S.C. 470 aa-mm). The plan also is
consistent with the Texas State requirements in the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource
Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191), its implementing regulations (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13,
Chapter 26), as well as chapters on Cemeteries (Chapter 22), and Chapters 711–715 of the Texas Health
and Safety Code.
PROCEDURES FOR THE DISCOVERY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES
1. If any member of the construction work force believes that a cultural resource discovery is
encountered the following will be implemented.
2. All work will immediately stop (unless safety concerns are an issue) and the Environmental
Inspector will be notified. The area of work stoppage will be adjusted as necessary to adequately
provide for the security, protection, and integrity of the resources. A cultural resource discovery
could consist of, but is not limited to the following examples:
 Prehistoric shell middens;
 Lithic and ceramic artifacts;
 Human and animal bone;
 Wooden ship timbers or sections of iron or steel hulls;
 Scattered cargo remains, such as ceramics, glass, wooden barrels or barrel staves;
 Any distinct mound of stones indicative of a ballast pile;
 Cannon and swivel guns and/or ammunition;
 Debris comprised of ship rigging, gear and fittings; and
 Groups of anchors or other objects that indicate the presence of a shipwreck.
3. If the Environmental Inspector believes that the discovery is a cultural resource, the
Environmental Inspector will take appropriate steps to protect the discovery site. This will include
recording the coordinates of the discovery, buoying the immediate area of discovery, stopping
work in the area and creating an exclusion zone, as well as notifying the Environmental Project

Manager. Work in the immediate area will not resume until evaluation and treatment (if
necessary) of the discovery has been completed.
4. Valley Crossing or its Company Representative will arrange for the discovery to be evaluated by
a qualified archaeologist. The archaeologist will determine whether the discovery is potentially
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
5. The archaeologist will immediately contact the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)
and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to seek consultation regarding the
National Register eligibility of the discovery. If the SHPO and the FERC conclude that the
discovery is an eligible deposit, consultation to determine appropriate treatment of the discovery
will commence. Treatment measures may include mapping, photography, limited probing and
sample collection, or other activities.
6. The archaeologist will rapidly implement the appropriate treatment measure(s) and provide a
report on methods and results.
PROCEDURES FOR THE DISCOVERY OF HUMAN REMAINS
1. Any human remains, burial sites, or burial related materials that are discovered during
construction will at all times be treated with dignity and respect.
2. If any member of the construction work force believes he or she has made an unanticipated
discovery of human skeletal remains, all work will be stopped and the Environmental Inspector
will be notified. The area of work stoppage will be adjusted as necessary to adequately provide
for the security, protection, and integrity of the remains.
3. The Environmental Inspector will be responsible for taking appropriate steps to protect the
discovery. This will include buoying the immediate area of discovery, stopping work in the area
and creating an exclusion zone, as well as notifying the Environmental Project Manager and/or
the Company Representative. Work within this area will not resume until cleared by the
appropriate agency and the Environmental Project Manager.
4. Valley Crossing, or its Company Representative, will immediately call the appropriate county
coroner who will examine the discovery and determine whether it should be treated as a crime
scene or as a human burial and notify appropriate parties.
5. If the remains are determined not to be connected with any kind of criminal activity, the coroner
or the project representative will notify the Texas SHPO within 24 hours. At this point,
consultation will commence between the members of the Texas SHPO, the FERC, appropriate
consulting parties including federally recognized Indian Tribes, and Valley Crossing to determine
appropriate action.
