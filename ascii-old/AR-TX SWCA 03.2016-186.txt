Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

ABSTRACT
At the request of Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. (Stantec) and on behalf of Travis County, SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the Arkansas
Bend Park in western Travis County, Texas. The Arkansas Bend Park is roughly 4 miles (6.4 kilometers)
south of Lago Vista, Texas, in western Travis County. As the proposed project will occur on lands owned
by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) (and leased by Travis County), a political subdivision of
the State of Texas, the project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas and the accompanying Rules of
Practice and Procedure. SWCA conducted investigations under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7595.
The proposed project area is the entire approximately 158.5-acre (64.14 hectares [ha]) park facility.
Planned construction throughout the project boundaries would include improvements to the beach, picnic
areas, playgrounds, boat ramps, associated infrastructure for the day use area, a new RV campground, the
improvement and addition of walk-in campsites, and restoration of disturbed land to natural conditions.
The proposed depth of impacts is not known at this time, but disturbances are not anticipated to exceed 5
feet (1.5 meters) below the ground surface.
Investigations included a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of the
project area. The background review determined that portions of the project area have been previously
surveyed and two previously recorded sites (41TV320 and 41TV321) are either within or along the
margins of the project area. Site 41TV320 is located at the southern end of the park, while site 41TV321
is located at the northwestern edge of the park. The historic map review revealed five possible historicage structures within the project area prior to the construction of Marshall Ford Dam in 1939 and the
intentional impoundment for Lake Travis in 1940. These structures would now be under water if extant.
Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed that the proposed project area has been impacted by
vegetation removal, park activity and installation of park facilities, and erosion. Subsurface investigations
involved the excavation of 101 shovel tests and examination of exposed cut bank profiles. During the
investigations, SWCA revisited the two previously recorded sites (41TV320 and 41TV321) and identified
two newly recorded sites (41TV2507 and 41TV2508). All of the sites are within the project area, with
previously recorded sites 41TV320 and 41TV321 extending west, beyond the northwestern and
southwestern portions of the project area, respectively.
Previously recorded sites 41TV320 and 41TV321 and newly recorded site 41TV2508 are strictly surficial
prehistoric lithic scatters of sparse chert debitage and tools diffusely scattered across upland knolls, hills,
and ridges. Site 41TV321 also contains sparse historical materials, though SWCA did not encounter the
historic features observed during the original recording. Due to the ubiquity of the site types in the region,
the low density of diffusely scattered surface artifacts, the lack of a subsurface component, the near
absence of any temporally diagnostic artifacts or cultural features, and the lack of overall integrity, the
portions of sites 41TV320 and 41TV321 within the project area as well as all of site 41TV2508 located
entirely within the project area have limited potential to yield new or important information concerning
regional prehistory. SWCA recommends that the portions of sites 41TV320 and 41TV321 within the
current project area, and site 41TV2508 entirely within the project area, are not eligible for inclusion in
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and do not warrant designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Based on these data, SWCA recommends that no further work or avoidance is
warranted for the portions of sites 41TV320 and 41TV321 within the project area, and site 41TV2508
entirely within the project area.
Site 41TV2507 consists of the remnants of a limestone rock wall situated entirely within the project area
along a prominent finger ridge overlooking Lake Travis. The rock wall was not encountered during the
historic map review and the age of the rock wall is unknown. Although the rock wall is in poor condition

i

and lacks a subsurface component, the age and association is unknown and the site could have potential to
yield new or important information concerning regional history. SWCA recommends that site 41TV2507
has an undetermined eligibility for designation as an SAL; avoidance of the feature is recommended. If
avoidance is not possible, then archival research would be necessary to contextualize the rock wall.
In accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good
faith effort to identify cultural resources properties within the Arkansas Bend Park Improvement project
area. Only one site (41TV2507) was identified that could potentially meet the criteria for designation as
an SAL, as per 13 Texas Administrative Code 26.10. SWCA recommends avoidance of site 41TV2507.
However, at the time of investigations, recent heavy rains had filled Lake Travis to capacity and the boat
ramp area was not available for survey. Although located on generally sloping terrain with a low potential
to contain intact cultural materials, SWCA recommends that when the lake levels are low enough to
safely access the boat ramp, a reconnaissance survey should be conducted to ensure no potentially
significant cultural resources would be impacted by the planned consruction.
No artifacts were collected during these investigations, thus there was no artifact curation. As per the
terms of the Antiquities Permit, all project paperwork, field forms, and photographs will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of the University of Texas.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

INTRODUCTION
At the request of Stantec Consulting Services, Inc.
(Stantec) and on behalf of Travis County, SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of Arkansas
Bend Park roughly 4 miles (6.4 kilometers [km])
south of Lago Vista in western Travis County,
Texas (Figure 1). The project is defined as the
entire approximately 158.5-acre (64.14 hectares
[ha]) park property. Survey efforts were
undertaken prior to planned construction
throughout the park.
As the proposed project will occur on lands owned
by the Lower Colorado River Authority (and
leased by Travis County), a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, the project is subject to the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and the
accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure,
which protects archaeological sites and historic
buildings on public land. All work was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7595.
Investigations consisted of an intensive cultural
resources survey with shovel testing. All
investigations were conducted in accordance with
Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards. The
cultural resources survey efforts were conducted
by SWCA archaeologists Mercedes C. Cody,
Alamea Young, Bruce Darnell, and Brandon S.
Young on March 24, 25, and 29, 2016. Ken
Lawrence served as Principal Investigator under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7595.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project area appears on portions of the
Mansfield Dam, TX (3097-233) U.S. Geological
Survey
(USGS)
7.5-minute
topographic
quadrangle maps along Arkansas Bend (see Figure
1). Figure 2 illustrates the general areas of planned
impacts, which will include improvements to the
beach, picnic areas, playgrounds, the existing boat
ramp, associated infrastructure for the day use
area, a new RV campground, the improvement and
addition of walk-in campsites, and restoration of
disturbed land to natural conditions. The proposed
depth of impacts is not known at this time, but

SWCA Environmental Consultants

disturbances are not anticipated to exceed 5 feet
(1.5 meters) below the ground surface.
The park is undeveloped aside from two-track
roads. The project area is bordered by residential
development to the west and the Colorado
River/Lake Travis to the east (see Figure 2). Aerial
imagery used to produce Figure 2 is dated to 2008,
as at that time Lake Travis was almost at full
capacity; the imagery better captures lake level
conditions as they were during the recent field
investigations.

GEOLOGY
The underlying geology of the project area
consists of the Early Cretaceous-age Glen Rose
Limestone Formation. The Glen Rose Limestone
Formation consists of limestone, dolomite, and
marl approximately 380 feet (116 m) thick (Barnes
1974). Given the age of these formations, they
have virtually no potential to contain intact buried
archaeological resources.

SOILS
Project area soils include, from most prevalent to
least prevalent: Brackett-Rock Outcrop Complex,
1 to 12 percent slopes; Tarrant-Rock Outcrop
Complex, 18 to 50 percent slopes; and Tarrant
soils, 5 to 18 percent slopes (Natural Resources
Conservation Service [NRCS] 2016). BrackettRock Outcrop Complex soils are found on steep
breaks along creeks and rivers and approximately
75 percent of the surface is covered with limestone
fragments measuring 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10
centimeters [cm]) in diameter (Werchan et al.
1974). The Brackett series soils developed in situ
from residuum weathered from limestone of
Cretaceous age, mainly from the Glen Rose
formation (NRCS 2016). A typical profile of
Brackett series soils exhibits gravelly clay loam
from 0 to 15 inches (0 to 38 cm) below ground
surface overlying paragravelly clay loam to 36
inches (91 cm) below ground surface that overlies
weakly cemented, fractured and weathered
limestone bedrock from 36 to 152 inches (91 to
386 cm) below ground surface (NRCS 2016).

Tarrant-Rock Outcrop Complex soils are found on
breaks and ravines along major rivers and
approximately 50 to 80 percent of the surface is
covered with rock outcrops and smaller loose
limestone fragments (Werchan et al. 1974). The
Tarrant series soils also developed in situ from
residuum weathered from limestone of Cretaceous
age (NRCS 2016). A typical profile of Tarrant
series soils exhibits very cobbly clay from 0 to 20
inches (0 to 51 cm) below ground surface
overlying extremely cobbly clay to 33 inches
(84 cm) below ground surface that overlies
fractured, indurated and platy limestone bedrock
from 33 to 76 inches (84 to 193 cm) below ground
surface (NRCS 2016).

VEGETATION
Travis County lies on the margins of the Edwards
Plateau, Grand Prairie, Post Oak Belt, and
Blackland Prairie vegetative regions as defined by
Correll and Johnston (1979). The Balcones
Escarpment forms a sharp vegetative boundary
between the thin-soiled limestone uplands and the
wide coastal plains.
The Edwards Plateau is dominated by a mixed live
oak (Quercus virginiana)/Ashe juniper (Juniperus
ashei) woodland interspersed with occasional
grassy openings. Other tree species present in low
densities throughout upland areas of the project
area include cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia),
blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), Texas oak
(Quercus texana), and some mesquite. Shrub
density varies between low to dense in these
upland areas. Species occurring in low densities
include Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana),
agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), and prickly pear
(Opuntia spp.) with thick, mixed grasses in areas
(Hudler 2000; Stein et al. 2003; Van Auken 1988).
In contrast, Hudler (2000:102) notes that pollen
data recovered from north Bexar County
determined that prehistoric indigenous flora was
generally more productive than today. This
research suggests that over the last 12,000 years,
the flora community was typically more abundant
than what is observed in the region currently
(Hudler 2000).

FAUNA
The project area is within the Balconian biotic
zone (Blair 1950). Approximately 50 percent of all
non-marine mammal species in Texas exist along
the Balcones Escarpment, the prominent
geological feature that marks the southern and
eastern extents of the biotic zone (Neck 1986).
Common mammals of the area include whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), plains pocket
gopher (Geomys bursarius), eastern cottontail
rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), nine-banded
armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), black-tailed
jackrabbit, and deer mouse (Peromyscus
maniculatis). Less common are the predatory
mammals, including the bobcat, coyote, and gray
fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). In addition to
these common mammals, bison (Bison bison),
mountain lion (Felis concolor), and black bear
(Ursus americanus) would have been present
prehistorically (Davis and Schmidly 1994; Hudler
2000).
At least 75 species of amphibians and reptiles are
listed within the Balconian Province (Blair 1950).
The Balcones Escarpment has been shown to be a
major limiting factor in the movement of these
species (Smith and Beuchner 1947). Bird species
composition in the project area is fairly diverse
with numerous breeding, migrant, and wintering
species present (Kutac and Caran 1994). Common
species, both migratory and resident, found in the
area include bobwhite quail, northern cardinal
(Cardinalis cardinalis), wood duck (Aix sponsa),
canvasback (Aythya valisineria), tufted titmouse
(Parus bicolor), Berwickâs wren (Thryomanes
bewickii), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura),
northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), redtailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), wild turkey
(Meleagris gallopavo), and turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura) (Hudler 2000:20; Kutac and
Caran 1994).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND
SETTING
Travis County is on the eastern edge of the
Edwards Plateau and near the eastern margins of
the Central Texas archaeological region, as
4

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

defined by Collins (2004), Prewitt (1981, 1985),
Suhm (1960), and others. The Central Texas
archaeological region is an artificial construct and
its boundaries are somewhat arbitrary (Collins
2004:102). As Collins (2004:103) points out, it is
unlikely that any group in the past 11,000 years
had their key resources, geographic range, or
political sphere conform to these boundaries. It is
worth noting that Perttula (2004:Fig 1.1) extends
the boundaries of Central Texas much farther east
than many researchers. Nevertheless, situated as it
is on the Edwards Plateauâs margins, the sites
identified within the project area share many traits
in common with âclassicâ Central Texas sites (i.e.,
those above the Balcones Escarpment).
As noted above, the project area is near the eastern
edge of the Central Texas archaeological region.
Its occupants likely ranged west, deeper into the
Edwards Plateau, and east, onto the rolling
Blackland Prairie. Inhabitants of the area,
therefore,
were
influenced
by
cultural
developments taking place in Central Texas, as
well as to the east. Regardless of the intensity or
nature of influences from off the plateau, we rely
on more developed chronologies from Central
Texas to summarize the cultural history of the
area. Following standard chronological divisions,
we divide the prehistoric cultural sequence into
three periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric. The Archaic period is commonly
subdivided into three subperiods (Early, Middle,
and Late), although, as this report addresses,
various labels have been applied to the last few
centuries of the Archaic. We generically call the
period from approximately 600 B.C. to A.D. 700
âthe end of the Archaic.â

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The Paleoindian period, which includes the
earliest known peoples in the area, began during
the close of the Pleistocene. The presence of
Paleoindian artifacts and sites, dating from about
11,500â8800 B.P., are not considered uncommon
in Central Texas (Collins 2004). Two of the more
important Paleoindian sites in Texas are near the
project area: the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235)
on Brushy Creek in southern Williamson County,

SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 28223

and the Gault site (41BL323) in adjacent Bell
County.
Diagnostic artifacts of the period include
lanceolate-shaped and fluted projectile points,
such as Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview. These
projectile points were hafted onto wooden spears
and often used to hunt big game, such as
mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel, and horse
(Black 1989; Bousman et al. 2004). Recent
research has demonstrated that Paleoindian people
relied on a more diverse subsistence base than
previously thought, exploiting a variety of plants
and small fauna in addition to the larger animals
(Bousman et al. 2004). Paleoindian lifeways
gradually transitioned to a more Archaic-style
adaptation (i.e., increasing reliance on plants and
smaller game, better-defined and smaller group
territories, and regional diversification in projectile
point styles) as the big game died off and the
climate warmed following the end of the
Pleistocene ice age (Bousman et al. 2004).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
As the Paleoindian period came to an end, humans
began to more intensively harvest local floral and
faunal resources. Material culture became more
regionally diversified, and the use of burned rock
middens and ovens became widespread. This
period is known as the Archaic and dates from
approximately 8800 to 1200 B.P. in Central Texas
(Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994).
EARLY ARCHAIC
The Early Archaic is commonly dated to ca. 8800
to 6000 B.P. (Collins 2004:119). Research suggests
that Early Archaic peoples became increasingly
reliant on local resources and residential mobility
decreased (Prewitt 1981:73; Suhm et al. 1954:18).
Early Archaic populations utilized base camps for
longer periods, perhaps seasonally, and hunted a
diverse array of small (e.g., snakes, turtles,
rodents, rabbits), medium (e.g., opossums and
raccoons), and large (e.g., deer and antelope)
game, fished local rivers, and cooked wild plant
bulbs in earth ovens. It is likely that the reduction
in residential mobility was related to a variety of
factors including diminished bison populations,

5

Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

population increase, tribal territoriality issues, and
climatic change. By the start of the Early Archaic,
well-established resident populations lived in
every biogeographical region of Texas.
Collins (2004:120) and McKinney (1981) observe
that a large number of Early Archaic sites are
documented along the eastern and southern
margins of the Edwards Plateau. They argue that if
our current understanding of Early Archaic site
distribution reflects prehistoric land use, then the
Early Archaic was a period when people were
living in the better-watered parts of the Edwards
Plateau. With very low population densities across
the state at the beginning of the Archaic, it makes
sense that the environmentally desirable zones,
such as the well-watered ecotone along the
margins of the Edwards Plateau, would be the first
areas to have been more heavily settled.
During the Early Archaic, projectile points became
more regionally diversified, and stemmed forms
replaced the lanceolate points of the Paleoindian
period. This technological shift may have been
due, in part, to the development of a more
localized, broad-based hunting and gathering
economy that necessitated differing point types for
different game (Johnson and Goode 1994; Story
1985). Early Archaic populations supplemented
their hunting diet with a diverse assemblage of
processed plant foods. This is most evident
through the use of hot rock cooking technologies,
which become commonplace at Early Archaic
sites. Early Archaic burned rock features are most
often small- to medium-sized hearths, with
minimal evidence of reuse. However, at a few
Early Archaic sites (e.g., Wilson-Leonard and
Loeve), larger earth ovens have been documented
(Collins et al. 1998; Prewitt 1982); these are
believed to be the precursors to burned rock
middens.
A burned rock midden is a large, dense feature of
burned rocks and ash-stained soil that accumulates
from use and reuse as a thermal cooking feature
(Black et al. 1997; Mahoney et al. 2003; Suhm
1960). The number of burned rock middens
increased throughout the Archaic period and it
seems clear that their technological roots lie in the
first earth ovens of the Early Archaic (Black et al.
1997; Collins et al. 1998; Decker et al. 2000).
SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 28223

Burned rock midden technology appears to have
first developed in the eastern plateau around 8,500
to 8,000 years ago and gradually spread into the
western plateau ca. 6,500 to 5,000 years ago
(Decker et al. 2000:301). These large features vary
greatly in size and form, but share the common
functional purpose of serving as an earth oven or
similar cooking device (Black et al. 1997; Weir
1976).
Work completed on the Gatlin site (41KR621) in
southern Central Texas highlighted the complexity
and diversity in the Early Archaic settlement
system noted by previous researchers (Houk et al.
2008). As Johnson (1991:159) states, âpeople
acquired different foods at different suitable
places,â meaning that certain sites were visited
repeatedly on a seasonal basis. Johnson
(1991:160) speculated that people in the eastern
part of Central Texas may not have had large base
camps, but instead traveled from site to site in
small groups; the Gatlin site data for the Early
Archaic period supports this hypothesis. In fact,
based on a study conducted as part of the Gatlin
site analysis, only the Wilson-Leonard site was
classified as an Early Archaic base camp out of 16
well-documented Early Archaic components in
Central Texas. The other sites all represent shortterm, specialized activity sites (Houk et al. 2008).
MIDDLE ARCHAIC
The Middle Archaic is commonly dated to ca.
6000 to 4000 B.P. (Collins 2004:120). During the
beginning of the Middle Archaic, from
approximately 5750 to 5250 B.P., Johnson and
Goode (1994:73) contend that a brief warm and
dry period arose. Hudler (2000) also documents a
major climatic shift towards warmer and drier
conditions ca. 5300 B.P., followed by a very brief
wet interval. Johnson and Goode (1994:73) also
believe this dry period was followed by a short
period of climatic amelioration between 5250 to
4600 B.P. with moderately wet and cool
conditions.
The Middle Archaic is marked by a significant
increase in archaeological sites on the Edwards
Plateau. It is difficult to determine if this increase
is due to a larger, denser population or an increase
in residential mobility (Turpin 2004). In either
6

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

case, there is abundant evidence that settlement
and subsistence became more regionally
specialized during this time. Burned rock hearths,
scatters, and concentrations are common at Middle
Archaic sites; however, none of these features is
more pronounced than the burned rock midden,
the use of which proliferated during the Middle
Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Prewitt 1981; Shafer
1988). There is widespread evidence supporting an
increased reliance on the processing of geophytes
and succulent plant bulbs such as sotol, yucca, and
lechuguilla in burned rock middens (Dering 1999).
Three distinct types of burned rock middens are
documented during the Middle Archaic: 1) sheet
middens, 2) dome middens, and 3) annular
middens (Mahoney et al. 2003). Sheet middens are
loose accumulations of displaced and mixed
burned rocks, usually derived from several burned
rock features. The rock displacement may be
caused by natural or cultural processes, including
erosion, flooding, feature maintenance, and/or
reuse. Dome middens are round, dome-shaped
accumulations of burned rock that can be several
feet thick. Dome middens form through repeated
feature use and maintenance, thus resulting in a
massive, dense accumulation of burned rock.
Annular middens (also called crescent, ring, or
donut middens) are circular or semicircular-shaped
accumulations of burned rock with a centralized
depression. Like dome middens, they may be
several feet thick.
Early Triangular dart points appear in the
beginning of the Middle Archaic subperiod,
around 5300 B.P. at the Gatlin site (Houk et al.
2008:Figure 13.2). This unstemmed type cooccurs with Bell and Andice points, which are
basally notched, stemmed point forms (Mahoney
et al. 2003; Sorrow et al. 1967). Wyckoffâs (1995)
research suggests that Bell and Andice points (also
known as Calf Creek points) are intrinsically
linked to bison hunting. Their appearance at the
beginning of the Middle Archaic is presumably
related to the return of bison to the area ca. 5000
B.P. Nolan and La Jita points, which have square
to rectangular stems with weak, rounded, or abrupt
shoulders, appear in the Central Texas
archaeological record ca. 4800 B.P. and persist into
the beginning of the Late Archaic (Houk et al.
2008:Figure 13.2).

LATE ARCHAIC
The Late Archaic began around ca. 4000 B.P. and
lasted until ca. 1200 B.P., ending when the bow
and arrow was introduced into Central Texas
(Collins 2004:121). Late Archaic sites are more
numerous than earlier Archaic period sites (Black
1989; Collins 2004) and some researchers argue
that population increased during the Late Archaic
(Johnson and Goode 1994; Prewitt 1981; Weir
1976).
Increasingly
complex
cultural
manifestations are characterized in the Late
Archaic archaeological record, and increased
population size may have contributed to this
complexity (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Territoriality issues may have also been more
commonplace in the Late Archaic. This argument
is somewhat supported by the development of
more formal cemeteries in many areas of Texas
(Hall 1981; Lukowski 1987; Taylor and Highley
1995). Burials from these cemeteries often contain
grave goods, such as marine shell ornaments (from
the Texas coast), boatstones (from Arkansas), and
corner tang knives (from the Edwards Plateau).
The presence of these items ultimately suggests
that plateau populations participated in some form
of a trade system during the Late Archaic (Hall
1981).
Compared to previous subperiods, an extremely
diverse assemblage of projectile point forms was
used during the Late Archaic. Kinney, Pedernales,
and Tortugas points appeared at the beginning of
the period. Pedernales points have bifurcated
stems and a narrow to broad, often leaf-shaped
blade (Turner and Hester 1999). Castroville,
Lange, Marcos, Marshall, Montell, Shumla, and
Williams points appear slightly later and for the
most part are all broad-bladed points that generally
have expanding stems and prominent, barbed
shoulders. Many of these early Late Archaic points
were apparently used for bison hunting (Dibble
and Lorrain 1968).
Hot rock cooking technologies developed in
previous periods continued to be employed during
the Late Archaic and burned rock middens are a
very common Late Archaic site feature. Many of
the burned rock middens that formed during the

7

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

Middle Archaic continued to be used by Late
Archaic peoples (Black et al. 1997).
LATE ARCHAIC TO LATE PREHISTORIC
TRANSITION
As Collins (2004:122) notes, âdiverse and
comparatively
complex
archaeological
manifestations toward the end of the Late Archaic
attest to the emergence of types of human conduct
without precedent in Texas.â As is discussed in
detail elsewhere in this report, various labelsâ
Transitional Archaic (Johnson et al. 1962; Turner
and Hester 1999), Terminal Archaic (Black 1989),
and Late Archaic II (Johnson and Goode 1994)â
have been applied to the end of the Archaic period.
While the names differ, these competing schemes
generally begin after Marcos points appear in
Central Texas, encompass the Fairland-Ensor-Frio
point style intervals, and end with the Darl point
type. The succeeding Late Prehistoric period
began ca. 1200 B.P. with the introduction of the
bow and arrow into Central Texas; the first
widespread arrow point type was Scallorn and it is
commonly
associated
with
the
Austin
phase/interval, or Late Prehistoric I (Collins 2004;
Johnson and Goode 1994). Bone-tempered
ceramics are also indicative of the Late Prehistoric
period, specifically the Toyah phase/interval, as
will be discussed below.
By the early part of the Late Archaic period,
Central Texas was occupied by broad-spectrum
foragers specializing in the resources available
within specific ranges or territories. Arnn
(2007:274â275) argues that the stabilization of
climatic patterns during the Late Archaic allowed
area-specific cultural material to emerge
throughout the region. For example, the
intensification in plant processing, evidenced by
increased accumulation of rock oven features and
burned rock middens, suggests an increasing
reliance on a resource that is essentially fixed on
the landscape (Arnn 2007:277).
Late Archaic groups did not exist in isolation and
the eventual spread of most Late Archaic point
styles, particularly the later style types, as well as
exotic materials, such as marine shell and perhaps
religious ideas, throughout the state suggests their
participating in a âvast web of social relationsâ
SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 28223

(Arnn 2007:277). Decorated bone ornaments, Gulf
whelk shells, and atlatl weights of exotic stone are
among the new types of materials to appear during
the Late Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Exotic materials are recovered from domestic
contexts, as well as burials suggesting they were a
pervasive component in the life of Late Archaic
peoples (Arnn 2007:277).
The end of the Archaic was an interesting time in
Central Texas, one that we are still struggling to
understand. Arnn (2007:278â279) argues âthat the
Late Archaic Period may be viewed as a precursor
(in terms of technology, subsistence, and
settlement practices) to similar technologies and
practices observed during the Late Prehistoric.â
Framing the research within that context, one of
continuity rather than change, may be a useful
approach for investigating the transition from the
Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. As is discussed
elsewhere, Johnson and Goode (1994:40)
characterize the termination of the Late Archaic as
the most difficult and complex of all the period
boundaries, noting that it may have ended either
400 years later with the Toyah phase, or even 400
years earlier, when small dart points types, like
Darl, appeared.
As noted above, the end of the Archaic period
chronologically is marked by the appearance of a
variety of small, side- and corner-notched dart
point types including Edgewood, Ellis, Ensor,
Fairland, and Frio (Turner and Hester 1999).
Johnson and Goode (1994:37) point to social
interaction with the eastern United States as a
possible source for these new point types. These
projectile points may have been part of a package
of new cultural items related to the spreading of
Eastern religious ideas from as far as the Edwards
Plateauâthese included the exotic items noted
above, such as marine shells and atlatl weights
(Johnson and Goode 1994:37).
An important cultural trait of the Late Archaic is
the appearance of formal cemeteries off of the
Edwards Plateauâon the plateau sinkholes
continued to be used as repositories for the dead.
Cemeteries, where many of the exotic items noted
above have been found, suggest that groups were
tied to specific territories. Cemeteries are more
common in the early Late Prehistoric, and the
8

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

many individuals buried in them show clear
evidence of violent deaths (Johnson and Goode
1994:40). Prewitt (1982:Table 4) provides an
exhaustive, if somewhat dated, list of cemeteries
and burials in eastern Central Texas and notes that
many incidences of Scallorn arrow points either
associated with a skeleton or clearly embedded in
the skeleton. The Loeve-Fox site (41WM230)
contained an Austin phase cemetery where warfare
was âsuggested by the direct association of
Scallorn arrow points with fatal positions in
several skeletonsâ (Prewitt 1982:12).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction of the bow and arrow and ceramics
into Central Texas marked the start of the Late
Prehistoric period. Population densities dropped
considerably from their Late Archaic peak (Prewitt
1985:217). Subsistence strategies did not differ
greatly from the preceding period, although bison
again became an important economic resource
during the late part of the Late Prehistoric period
(Prewitt 1981:74). Use of rock and earth ovens for
plant food processing and the subsequent
development of burned rock middens continued
throughout the Late Prehistoric period (Black et al.
1997; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795). Horticulture
came into play very late in the region, but was of
minor importance to overall subsistence strategies
(Collins 2004:122).
In Central Texas, the Late Prehistoric period
generally is associated with the Austin and Toyah
phases (Jelks 1962; Prewitt 1981:82â84). Austin
and Toyah phase horizon markers and ScallornEdwards and Perdiz arrow points, respectively, are
distributed across most of the state. Violence and
conflict often marked introduction of Scallorn and
Edwards arrow points into Central Texasâmany
excavated burials contain these point tips in
contexts indicating they were the cause of death
(Prewitt 1981:83). Subsistence strategies and
technologies (other than arrow points) did not
change much from the preceding Late Archaic
period. Prewittâs (1981) use of the term
âNeoarchaicâ recognizes this continuity. In fact,
Johnson and Goode (1994:39â40) and Collins
(2004:122) state that the break between the Austin
and Toyah phases could easily and appropriately

SWCA Environmental Consultants

represent the break between the Late Archaic and
the Late Prehistoric.

HISTORIC PERIOD
In the early Historic period (A.D. 1630 to present),
the period of European contact and settlement in
Texas, the general Austin area was inhabited by
several Native American groups including the
Jumano, Tonkawa, Lipan Apache and Comanche
(Newcomb 2002). The first Europeans into the
area were probably Spanish missionaries who
established three missions at nearby Barton
Springs in 1730 (Webb 1952). The Spanish
mission period in this area was of short duration
and failed to colonize or even tame the area south
of the Colorado River and north of Onion Creek.
A Native American presence thus continued in the
Austin area into the 1860s.
After Mexico gained independence from Spain,
the newly formed country used a policy of land
grants to attract Anglos from the United States to
help inhabit the sparsely populated northern
regions of Mexico. During the 1820s, Stephen F.
Austin obtained grants from the Mexican
government to settle hundreds of families along
the lower Brazos and Colorado Rivers (Webb
1952). This colony, known as the âOld Three
Hundred Colony,â was successful in pushing the
European settlement frontier further west into the
Central Texas region. Prior to the Texas
Revolution, most of the âOld Three Hundred
Colonyâ settlement was focused south of Bastrop
and the old La Bahia Road (Webb 1952).
During the Texas Revolution with Mexico, the
area continued to be inhabited only by aboriginal
Native Americans. After the war, a growing Texan
population led many settlers to move northwards
in search of open, profitable land to plant crops
and raise cattle. This wave of migration spurred
new conflicts with the native groups living in the
area, cumulating in the Battle of Brushy Creek,
near what is today the town of Taylor, in February
of 1839. This battle between the Comanche and
the Texas Rangers resulted in numerous deaths
and eventually in the removal of the Native
American presence in the area.

9

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

After the battle, the nearby town of Waterloo, on
the banks of the Colorado River, was renamed
Austin and designated the seat of government for
the Republic of Texas in 1839 (Webb 1952).
Subsequent to the Civil War, Texas entered the
Reconstruction period. To begin reconstruction,
federal troops, in part, had to spread the word of
the Emancipation Proclamation (Campbell
2003:268). In Galveston on June 19, 1865,
General Gordon Granger and the Union army
spread the word of the slavesâ emancipation
(Campbell 2003:268). Thus, this day became
known as âJuneteenthâ and has been celebrated by
Texas African Americans ever since (Campbell
2003:268).
Lawlessness became a problem during the 1880s,
and Central Texas counties experienced a period
of âmob rule.â Citizens formed an anti-mob
organization, but competing groups conducted
essentially open warfare. After several people
were killed, the Texas Rangers were dispatched to
the area and order was eventually restored
(Murphy 2007).
Recovery during this period was gradual, but was
assisted by a diverse agricultural economy,
particularly cattle. In the 1870s, several major
cattle trails heading to markets passed through
Central Texas. One invention that had an effect on
Texas and its economy during this time was
barbed wire. Barbed wire, first demonstrated in
1871, enabled ranchers to alter land and control
cattle in a less-intrusive, more profitable manner,
and brought additional commerce and trade to
central Texas (National Register of Historic Places
[NRHP] 1976). Though barbed wire was one of
the largest influences on Texas in general, the
most influential âinventionâ on the region was the
railroad. The railroads effectively served as a
means of transportation and, to varying degrees,
generally bolstered growth in the economies of the
region.
Throughout the early twentieth century, trade,
transportation, and tourism continued to bring
economic prosperity to the region. The
establishment of military facilities and the activity
surrounding World War I and World War II kept

SWCA Environmental Consultants

the railway system active and commercial activity
in the east prospered.
Through the remainder of the twentieth century
and into the early twenty-first century, population
in Central Texas has increased largely due to
expansion and commercial opportunities in urban
and rural areas. The construction of public
highways and automobiles facilitated the
commuting of Central Texas citizens to centers of
urban employment.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA performed a cultural resources records
review to determine if the proposed project area
had been previously surveyed for cultural
resources or if any archaeological sites had been
recorded within, or adjacent to, the project area.
To conduct this review, an SWCA archaeologist
reviewed portions of the Mansfield Dam, TX
(3097-233) USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle map on the THC Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (Atlas). This source provided
information on the nature and location of
previously conducted archaeological surveys,
previously recorded cultural resource sites,
locations of NRHP properties, sites designated as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), Official
Texas Historical Markers, Registered Texas
Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local
neighborhood surveys. SWCA also examined
aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology
Maps, and the NRCS Web Soil Survey. The Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic
Overlay was examined to identify the presence of
potential historic-age structures.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCAâs investigations consisted of an intensive
pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations
of the 156.55-acre (63.4-ha) portion of the original
399-acre (161.5-ha) project area not submerged
below the waters of Lake Travis/Colorado River.
Archaeologists examined the ground surface and
erosional profiles and exposures for cultural
materials. Subsurface investigations involved

disturbances, and landforms. Where performed,
shovel tests were systematically excavated.

distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to
yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

SWCA archaeologists excavated shovel tests in 8inch (20-cm) arbitrary levels to 39.4 inches (1 m)
in depth unless soil characteristics or bedrock
precluded reaching that depth; all removed matrix
was screened through Â¼-inch mesh. The location
of each shovel test was plotted using a hand-held
sub-meter accurate Global Positioning System
(GPS) receiver and was recorded on a
standardized digital form in field tablets. Areas
with previously recorded sites or other cultural
resources revealed in the archival research
required additional shovel testing to explore the
nature of the cultural deposits. SWCA
archaeologists excavated shovel tests to the depth
of project impacts, when possible. SWCA
conducted a non-collection survey. Artifacts were
tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the field,
but not collected.

For SAL designation, SWCA evaluated each
archaeological site for: 1) density, thickness, and
time span of cultural deposit; 2) integrity; 3)
research potential; and 4) susceptibility to
vandalism.

SITE EVALUATIONS
SWCA assessed each previously or newly
recorded prehistoric and/or historic archaeological
site for eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP
according to 36 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) 60.4, or for designation as SALs according
to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26.8 of
the Rules of Practice and Procedure. Assessments
considered both the archaeological aspects of sites
and any standing structures.
NRHP eligibility assessed the following criteria:
(a) associated with events that have made a
significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
(b) associated with the lives of persons
significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics
of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of
a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCAâs background review determined that a
single cultural resources survey was conducted
within portions of the proposed project area in
1975, documenting two archaeological sites
(41TV320 and 41TV321) within the current
project area. One additional survey, one cemetery,
and five archaeological sites (41TV30, 41TV34,
41TV35, 41TV228, and 41TV235) are within a 1mile (1.6 km) radius of the project area, but
removed from potential project impacts (Atlas
2016). A review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay
maps, historic topographic quadrangle maps, and
historic aerial imagery revealed five possible
historic-age structures within the project area
(Foster et al. 2006; USGS 2016).
In 1975, the Lower Colorado River Authority
(LCRA) conducted a reconnaissance survey of
195 acres (78.9 ha) of Arkansas Bend Park
(Sorrow 1975). Two sites, 41TV320 and
41TV321, were recorded within the park
boundaries during these investigations. Site
41TV320 is located on a small rise at the southern
end of the park (Atlas 2016). The site consists of a
scatter of prehistoric artifacts including two end
scrapers, several other scraper fragments, and a
few flakes and cores. The artifact assemblage is
sparse and is concentrated on the southwest side of
the site. Additional cultural material may be extant
outside the LCRA project area to the west. No
recommendations regarding further work or
NRHP or SAL eligibility were provided.

Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

Site 41TV321 is located at the northwestern edge
of the park at the corner of Sleepy Hollow Drive
and Lakeview Avenue, on a hill overlooking Lake
Travis (Atlas 2016). The site contains the
remnants of a stone structure of unknown age and
function. Features at the site consist of a 10- by
12-foot (3.0- by 3.7-m) stone foundation, rock
fence remnants, two single-line stone alignments,
and a mound of dirt and rock. The artifact
assemblage included wire nails, bois dâarc drift
fence with wire nails, 3-part mold bottle
fragments, a bag of hardened cement, and beer
cans. A post-1958 meter pole and Pedernales
Electric dead head pole were also present, but do
not appear to be associated with the site. No
recommendations regarding further work or
NRHP or SAL eligibility were provided.
One additional survey, one cemetery, and five
archaeological sites (41TV30, 41TV34, 41TV35,
41TV228, and 41TV235) are located within a 1mile (16-km) radius of the project area. A linear
survey for Ranch-to-Market (RM) 620 was
conducted in 1987 on behalf of the Federal
Highways Works Administrations approximately
0.5 mile (0.8 km) south of the current project area
(Atlas 2016). No archaeological sites were
recorded within a 1-mile (1.6-km) radius of the
project area during these investigations.
One cemetery, the Teck Cemetery (TV-C048), is
located 0.46 mile (0.74 km) south of the project
area just north of RM 620 (Atlas 2016). The
cemetery is a small community cemetery with 237
interments, the oldest of which is Wiley K.
Hudson,
born
1824
and
died
1862
(Findagrave.com 2016). Other prominent family
names at the cemetery include Clifton, Combs,
Haydon, McCown, and Stewart.
All five of the previously recorded sites within a
1-mile (1.6-km) radius of the project area were
recorded in 1937â1938 by A. T. Jackson from the
University of Texas at Austin (Atlas 2016). All of
the sites are prehistoric-age open campsites and all
contain burned rock middens, except for site
41TV30. No recommendations regarding NRHP
or SAL eligibility was stated on the site forms.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
The review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps
revealed five possible historic-age structures
within the project area (Foster et al. 2006).
However, the construction of Marshall Ford Dam
in 1939, followed by the intentional impoundment
for Lake Travis in 1940, caused a significant
increase in the width of the Colorado River
adjacent to the project area (Breeding 2016).
Those structures are not depicted on later maps, as
they would now appear to be underwater if still
extant.
The 1894 General Land Office Travis County map
exhibits the project area within land parcels owned
by Caleb Cox and J. L. Marshall; however, no
structures are depicted (Foster et al. 2006). The
1896 USGS Austin Quadrangle map depicts three
possible historic-age structures along roads in the
southeast portion of the project area. The 1932
Travis County Topographic and Road map
exhibits one possible historic-age structure within,
and two possible historic-age structures, along
roads immediately west of the project area. The
1932 USGS Mount Bonnell Quadrangle map
shows one possible historic-age structure at the
north end of the project area and two possible
historic-age structures along roads immediately
east of the project area of which one is accounted
for in the above 1896 USGS Austin Quadrangle
map. All of these maps dating from 1894 to 1932
portray the project area prior to the
aforementioned increase in width of the Colorado
River. The 1959 USGS Lake Travis and the 1968
USGS Mansfield Dam quadrangle maps do not
depict structures within the project area. These
maps portray the project area after the
impoundment of this portion of the Colorado
River.
SWCA also conducted a review of historic maps
from
TopoView
(USGS
2016)
and
HistoricAerials.com (2016) in order to determine
if any historic-age built resources were located
within the project area and to develop an idea of
land development over time. A review was
conducted of topographic maps dated to 1896,
1897, 1910, 1932, 1959, and 1968 and aerial maps
dated to 1964, 1966, 1967, 1973, 1985, 1995,
2004, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Topographic maps
12

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

from 1896 to 1932 depict several structures within
the project area (historicaerials.com 2016; USGS
2016). As previously mentioned, the construction
of Marshall Ford Dam in 1939 followed by the
intentional impoundment of Lake Travis in 1940
caused a significant increase in the width of the
Colorado River adjacent to the project area
(Breeding 2016). As such, the previously
mentioned structures are not depicted on later
maps and would now be under water (if even still
extant). The available historic aerial maps depicted
the general area remaining primarily open ranch
land, disturbed by vegetation removal and a
network of roads. A significant increase in
residential development is noted in 1973
surrounding the project area, including the
construction of a development along the western
margin of the park. The development in the
surrounding area remains rather constant and
continues into the present. The aerial maps
revealed the project area itself remains relatively
unchanged from 1964 to the present, although
evidence of drought conditions is exhibited in the
1964 and 2012 maps. The review of the aerial
maps also depicts the gravel pit areas portrayed on
current topographic maps.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
On March 24, 25, and 29, 2016, SWCA
archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey of the accessible 156.55 acres (63.4 ha) of
the 399-acre (161.5-ha) park that were not
submerged beneath Lake Travis (Figure 3). Field
investigations encountered a primarily wooded
environment dominated by dense clusters of
juniper trees and thorny underbrush with short to
medium grasses and/or exposed limestone bedrock
and gravels with some open areas within the
survey area (Figure 4). Ground surface visibility
throughout the survey area ranged between 0 to
100 percent, and averaged approximately
40 percent, although surface visibility was less
(approximately 5 percent) within the more densely
wooded areas.
The general setting can be characterized as an
undeveloped environment with a moderate level of
residential development bordering the park to the

SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 28223

west. More specifically, the project area captures a
diverse environment with rocky uplands dissected
by the Colorado River and high bluff edges
overlooking Lake Travis to the east (Figure 5).
Aside from the park trails and facilities, the
property is largely unmodified. Impacts within the
park include erosion, vegetation clearing,

park,
infrastructure, and pedestrian traffic (Figures 6 and
7). The impact of vegetation clearing is likely
fairly shallow, given the nature of the thin clayey
soils. In addition, there are large gravel pit areas
along the northwest and southeast sides of Cherry
Lane near the park entrance along the western
margin (Figure 8).
The majority of soil in the project area consists of
extremely stony silt loam to silty clay and clay
loam to clay that developed in place and does not
have the potential for intact, buried cultural
material. Between the upland and lowland areas
are steep rocky slopes and bluffs with little to no
soil (see Figure 5). Accordingly, the slopes were
subject to pedestrian survey with limited shovel
testing on flat benches, when they were
encountered.
SWCA excavated a total of 101 shovel tests
(AY01â41, BAD01â31, BY01â08, and MCC01â
21) within the 156.55-acre (63.4-ha) survey area
situated above the Lake Travis/Colorado River
water line, none of which contained cultural
materials (see Figure 3; Appendix A). Overall,
shovel tests were excavated to an average depth of
5.9 inches (15 cm) below ground surface and
consisted of silt loam to silty clay and clay loam
and clay loam to clay with an abundance of
angular, limestone gravels/cobbles and degrading
bedrock. Shovel tests terminated at shallow
limestone bedrock or impassable cobbles
(Appendix A). Shovel tests were excavated
throughout the accessible survey area and focused
on locations with a potential for buried
archaeological remains, including previously
recorded and newly recorded sites. The THCâs
survey standards for projects from 101 to 200
acres in size recommend one shovel test per every
three acres. SWCA exceeded the number of shovel
tests for the 156.55-acre (63.4-ha) survey area
above the current lake level.

SWCA revisited and surveyed the two previously
recorded cultural resources sites (41TV320 and
41TV321) within the survey area, which extend
due west beyond the southwestern and
northwestern portions of the project area,
respectively. As previously discussed, the previous
investigations at the sites did not provide
recommendations regarding further work or
NRHP and SAL eligibility. In addition, SWCA
identified two new previously undocumented
cultural resources sites (41TV2507 and
41TV2508) during the survey. The two newly
recorded sites are entirely within the project area.

the survey area are discussed below, including

extends due west roughly 203 feet (62 m) beyond
the southwestern margin of the park (see Figure
3). The current survey only investigated the
portion of the site within the park boundaries. A
network of two-track roads and park trails runs
throughout the site area (Figure 9). Push piles
were also observed particularly in the
southwestern portion of the site.
Ground surface visibility ranges from 0 to 100
percent within the site and averages 40 percent
(Figure 10). Vegetation includes juniper trees,
sparse oak, underbrush, and short to medium
grasses. In addition to two-track roads and park
trail disturbance, evidence of extensive erosion
was observed at the site.

Site 41TV320 was originally recorded in 1975 as a
low-density prehistoric lithic scatter on an upland
rise within the southwestern portion of the park
(see Figure 3). The site was described as
containing a sparse scatter of prehistoric artifacts,
including two end scrapers, several other scraper
fragments, and a few flakes and cores covering an
area roughly 328 feet (100 m) north to south by
1,843 feet (462 m) east to west, concentrated on
the southwest side of the site. No
recommendations regarding further work or
NRHP and SAL eligibility were provided.
SWCAâs recent investigations similarly observed
a sparse quantity of diffusely scattered lithic
debitage and tools, mostly concentrated in the
southwest portion of the site. The extent of
cultural materials observed during the current
investigations measures 364 feet (111 m) north to
south by 1,312 feet (400 m_) east to west, with the
northern and eastern boundaries determined by
artifact distribution. The northwestern site
boundary was expanded slightly north-northwest
to the two-track road, due to the presence of
artifacts on the ground surface.
SWCA excavated five shovel tests (AY27,
BAD24, and MCC08â10) within the 41TV320
revised site boundary, and a further six shovel
tests (AY26, AY28â29, BAD 23, and BAD25â26)
in the immediate vicinity (Figure 11; Appendix
A). None of the shovel tests were positive for
cultural materials. Shovel tests extended to a
maximum depth of 9.8 inches (25 cm) below
ground surface, at which depth bedrock was
encountered.
Artifacts observed on the surface of the site
included one heavily patinated dart point base, two
biface fragments of which one is heavily patinated,
one modified flake, 25 to 50 primary reduction
flakes, 50 to 100 secondary reduction flakes, and
100 to 200 tertiary reduction flakes, with the raw
material consisting of fine-grained chert (Figure
12). The dart point base fragment exhibits a
significantly concave base and is likely a Gower or
Uvalde type. The Gower and Uvalde dart points
have an Early Archaic temporal association, with

SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 28223

Gower point dates ranging from 7,160 to 6,290
(Figure 13; Turner et al. 2011). No cultural
features were observed within the site.
B.P.

SUMMARY
Previously recorded 41TV320 is a surficial site
consisting of chert debitage and few lithic tools
diffusely scattered across an upland rise
overlooking Lake Travis. The site was initially
identified in 1975 as a sparse prehistoric lithic
scatter and no recommendations regarding further
work or NRHP and SAL eligibility were provided.
The current investigations similarly observed a
sparse artifact assemblage with no subsurface
deposits within the current project area.
Due to the ubiquity of the site type in the region,
the low density of diffusely scattered surface
artifacts, the lack of a subsurface component, the
near absence of any temporally diagnostic
artifacts, paucity of cultural features, and the lack
of overall integrity across the site, the parts of
41TV320 within the project area have limited
potential to yield new or important information
concerning
regional
prehistory.
SWCA
recommends that the portion of 41TV320 within
the current project area is not eligible for
designation as an SAL.

41TV321
SWCA revisited previously recorded site
41TV321 during the survey. The site is within the
northwestern portion of the project area and a
large part of the site extends due west roughly
459 feet (140 m) beyond the northwestern margin
of the park (see Figure 3). Several park trails run
throughout the site area.
Ground surface visibility ranges from 0 to 100
percent within the site and averages 30 percent
overall (Figure 14). Vegetation includes juniper
trees, sparse oak, underbrush, and short to medium
grasses. In addition to park trail disturbance,
evidence of extensive erosion was observed at the
site.

Site 41TV321 was originally recorded in 1975 as
the remnants of a stone structure of unknown age
and function and associated historic artifact scatter
at the northwestern edge of the park on a hill
overlooking Lake Travis (see Figure 3). Features
reported at the site consisted of a 10- by 12-foot
(3.0- by 3.7-m) stone foundation, rock fence
remnants, two single-line stone alignments, and a
mound of dirt and rock. The artifact assemblage
included wire nails, bois dâarc drift fence with
wire nails, 3-part mold bottle fragments, a bag of
hardened cement, and beer cans over an area
roughly measuring 640 feet (195 m) north to south
by 709 feet (216 m) east to west. No
recommendations regarding further work or
NRHP and SAL eligibility were provided.
SWCAâs recent investigations did not observe the
historic cultural features described during the
initial recording, which may be situated in the
portion of the site extending west of the park
boundary along the top of the upland hill (Figure
15). Current investigations observed very sparse
historic materials, including one square cut nail
and 5 to 10 possible historic cans with pull tops
that indicate an early to mid-twentieth century
temporal affiliation, as well as very sparse
prehistoric materials, consisting of two primary
reduction flakes, two secondary reduction flakes,
and 10 shatter fragments likely washed downslope
from beyond the park boundary (Figures 16 and
17). The portion of the site immediately along the
park boundary appears destroyed. The extent of
cultural materials observed during the current
investigations measures 617 feet (188 m) north to
south by 295 feet (90 m) east to west along the
western park boundary, retaining roughly the
original site dimensions.

SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 28223

SWCA excavated seven shovel tests (AY04â10)
within the 41TV321 original site boundary and an
additional six shovel tests (AY03, BAD 04â05,
BY 01â02, and MCC15) in the immediate vicinity
(Figure 18; Appendix A). None of the shovel tests
were positive for cultural materials. Shovel tests
extended to a maximum depth of 17.8 inches
(45 cm) below ground surface at which bedrock
was encountered.
SUMMARY
Previously recorded 41TV321 is a surficial site
consisting of very sparse historic artifact scatter as
well as chert debitage diffusely distributed across
an upland hill overlooking Lake Travis. The site
was initially identified in 1975 as the remnants of
a stone structure of unknown age and function and
historic artifact scatter, with no recommendations
regarding further work or NRHP and SAL
eligibility provided. The current investigations did
not observe the historic cultural features
encountered during the initial recording; they may
be situated in the portion of the site extending west
of the park boundary. Current investigations
encountered very sparse historic and prehistoric
cultural materials with no subsurface deposits
within the available survey area.
Due to the ubiquity of the site type in the region,
the low density of diffusely scattered surface
artifacts, the lack of a subsurface component, the
absence of any temporally diagnostic artifacts or
cultural features, and the lack of overall integrity
across the site, the portions of 41TV321 within the
project area have limited potential to yield new or
important information concerning regional history
or prehistory. SWCA recommends that the parts of
41TV321 within the park boundaries are not
eligible for designation as an SAL.

41TV2507
Newly recorded site 41TV2507 consists solely of
the remnants of a rock wall identified and recorded
during the survey along a prominent finger ridge
overlooking Lake Travis (see Figure 3). The Lshaped rock wall is in the mid-portion of the
project area.
At the time of investigations, ground surface
visibility averaged 10 to 20 percent within the site
area, with abundant exposed bedrock and large
cobbles. Vegetation includes juniper trees, sparse
oak, underbrush, and short to medium grasses.
Many portions of the rock wall are overgrown
with vegetation. Disturbances in the area include
two-track roads, park infrastructure and trails, and
extensive erosion.
The rock wall, designated Feature F01, trends east
to west along the slope/bluff edge overlooking
Lake Travis for approximately 466 feet (142 m),
then makes a sharp turn at the corner and runs
north to south for roughly 541 feet (165 m)
(Figure 19). The wall is composed of dry stacked
angular limestone rocks and is roughly 39.4 inches
(1 m) wide and ranges from 11.8 to 27.6 inches
(30 to 70 cm) in height (Figures 20â24). The wall
is four courses high at the tallest, most intact
corner section. The wall is mostly in poor
condition and is not always contiguous, displaying
multiple gaps. No cultural materials were observed
on the ground surface in the vicinity of the site.
The rock wall was not noted during the historic
map review and the age of the rock wall is
unknown.
Along the eastern section the rock wall, is a rocklined path leading to the wall. In the vicinity of
this path is a rock-lined fire pit with a juniper
growing through the middle of it. Both seem to

SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 28223

have been constructed as a result of park activities.
Additionally, the rock wall is paralleled by a tree
break, which may be a possible old roadbed.
SWCA excavated 10 shovel tests (AY24â25 and
BAD13â17, BAD20â22) within the site boundary
(see Figure 19; Appendix A). None of the shovel
tests were positive for cultural materials. Shovel
tests extended to a maximum depth of 9.8 inches
(25 cm) below ground surface at which bedrock
was encountered.
SUMMARY
Site 41TV2507 consists of the remnants of a rock
wall composed of stacked angular limestone rocks
entirely within the project area along a prominent
finger ridge overlooking Lake Travis. The noncontinuous L-shaped wall is in poor condition and
overgrown with vegetation; it is situated along the
slope/bluff edge overlooking the water. The rock
wall was not identified during the historic map
review and the age of the rock wall is unknown.
No cultural materials were observed on ground
surface in the vicinity of the site and the 10 shovel
tests excavated in the immediate vicinity of the
wall were all negative for cultural materials.
Although the rock wall is in poor condition and
lacks a subsurface component, the age and
association is unknown and the site could have
potential to yield new or important information
concerning regional history. SWCA recommends
therefore that site 41TV2507 has an undetermined
eligibility for designation as an SAL. Avoidance
of the feature is recommended; if avoidance is not
possible, then archival research would be
necessary to determine construction date(s) and
the potential for association with a significant
individual or event.

41TV2508
Newly recorded site 41TV2508 is a prehistoric
lithic scatter identified during survey efforts in the
southeastern portion of the project area, on top of
an upland knoll on a prominent finger ridge
overlooking Lake Travis (see Figure 3). The site is
approximately 2,575 feet (785 m) southeast of the
park entrance and immediately adjacent to, and
overlooking, Lake Travis. A two-track road bisects
the site area roughly oriented east-northeast to
south-southwest (Figure 25).
Ground surface visibility averages 75 percent
within the site area with abundant exposed
bedrock and large cobbles (Figure 26). Vegetation
includes juniper trees, sparse oak, underbrush, and
short to medium grasses. In addition to the twotrack road and park trail disturbance, evidence of
extensive erosion was observed at the site. The site
is eroding down the landform and chert cobbles
are present along the shoreline to the north.

SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 28223

The investigations encountered a sparse and
diffuse surficial lithic scatter mainly composed of
chert shatter. Materials observed included 10
tested cobbles, two early stage bifaces,
approximately 50 primary reduction flakes and 30
secondary reduction flakes (Figures 27â29). No
temporally diagnostic artifacts or features were
observed. The extent of cultural materials
observed during the current investigations
measures 571 feet (174 m) north to south by
554 feet (169 m) east to west within the survey
area, with the boundaries determined by artifact
distribution.
SWCA excavated seven shovel tests (AY35â37,
AY39â41, and BAD31) within the site boundary
and three shovel tests (AY34, AY38, and BAD30)
in the immediate vicinity (see Figure 25;
Appendix A). None of the shovel tests were
positive for cultural materials. Shovel tests
extended to a maximum depth of 5.9 inches
(15 cm) below ground surface at which bedrock
was encountered.

SUMMARY
Site 41TV2508 is a sparse, diffuse, strictly
surficial lithic scatter mainly composed of chert
shatter accompanied by some flakes and two
bifaces. The site is situated on an upland knoll
with shallow soils immediately on top of bedrock,
on a prominent finger ridge overlooking Lake
Travis. Due to the ubiquity of the site type in the
region, the low density of diffusely scattered
surface artifacts, the lack of a subsurface
component, the absence of any temporally
diagnostic artifacts or cultural features, and the
lack of overall integrity across the site, the site has
limited potential to yield new or important
information concerning regional prehistory.
SWCA recommends that site 41TV2508 within
the current project area is not eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP and does not warrant designation as
an SAL.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Stantec and Travis County, SWCA
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
of Arkansas Bend Park in western Travis County,
Texas. The work was conducted as part of the
sponsorâs compliance with the ACT (Permit No.
7595). As such, considerations of site significance
were made according to criteria established in the
ACT.
Investigations included a background review and
an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing
of the entire project area except the extremely
steep slopes leading down to the lake edge where
pedestrian access was not safe or feasible. The
background review determined that portions of the
project area have been previously surveyed and
two previously recorded sites (41TV320 and
41TV321) are located within, or along, the
margins of the project area. Site 41TV320 is
located at the southern end of the park, while site
41TV321 is located on the northwestern edge of
the park. The historic map review revealed five
possible historic-age structures within the project
area prior to the construction of Marshall Ford
Dam in 1939 and the intentional impoundment for
Lake Travis in 1940; these structures would now
be underwater.

SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 28223

Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed
that the proposed project area has been impacted
by park activity, as evidenced by past vegetation
removal for park trails and the installation of park
facilities, while the surrounding uplands contain a
moderate amount of residential development. The
project area has been significantly affected by
erosion and park activities. The subsurface
investigations consisted of 101 shovel tests and
examination of exposed cut bank profiles. During
the investigations, SWCA revisited two previously
recorded sites (41TV320 and 41TV321) and
identified two newly recorded sites (41TV2507
and 41TV2508). All of the sites are located within
the project area, with parts of previously recorded
sites 41TV320 and 41TV321 extending west
beyond the northwestern and southwestern
portions of the project area, respectively.
Previously recorded sites 41TV320 and 41TV321
and newly recorded site 41TV2508 are strictly
surficial prehistoric lithic scatters of sparse chert
debitage and tools scattered across upland knolls,
hills, and ridges. Site 41TV321 also contains
sparse historic materials, although SWCA did not
encounter the historic features observed during the
original site recording. Due to the ubiquity of the
site types in the region, the low density of
diffusely scattered surface artifacts, the lack of a
subsurface component, the near absence of any
temporally diagnostic artifacts or cultural features,
and the lack of overall integrity, the portions of
sites 41TV320 and 41TV321 within the project
area, as well as all of site 41TV2508 within the
project area, have no potential to yield new or
important information concerning regional
prehistory. SWCA recommends that the parts of
41TV320 and 41TV321 within the current project
area, and all of site 41TV2508, are not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and do not warrant
designation as SALs. Based on these data, SWCA
recommends that no further work or avoidance is
warranted for the currently assessed portions of
sites 41TV320 and 41TV321 and the entirety of
site 41TV2508.
Site 41TV2507 consists of the remnants of a
limestone rock wall situated entirely within the
project area along a prominent finger ridge
overlooking Lake Travis. The rock wall was not
identified during the historic map review and the
33

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Arkansas Bend Park Improvements Project, Travis County, Texas

age of the rock wall is unknown. Although the
rock wall is in poor condition and lacks a
subsurface component, the age and association is
unknown and the site could have potential to yield
new or important information concerning regional
history. SWCA recommends that site 41TV2507
has an undetermined eligibility for designation as
an SAL. Avoidance of the feature is
recommended; if avoidance is not possible, then
additional archival research would be necessary to
determine construction date(s) and potential
association with a significant individual or event.
In accordance with 33 CFR 800.4, SWCA has
made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
cultural resources properties within the project
area. Only one property (41TV2507) was
identified that could potentially meet the criteria
for designation as an SAL, as per 13 TAC 26.10.
As such, SWCA recommends avoidance of site
41TV2507; if avoidance is not possible then
archival research would be necessary to determine
date of construction and any potential association

SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 28223

with a significant person or event. No further
cultural resources work or avoidance measures are
recommended for sites 41TV320, 41TV321, and
41TV2508. However, at the time of investigations,
recent heavy rains had filled Lake Travis to
capacity and the boat ramp areas were not
available for survey. Although located on
generally sloping terrain with a low potential to
contain intact cultural materials, SWCA
recommends that when the lake levels are low
enough to safely access the existing and proposed
boat ramp locations, a reconnaissance survey
should be conducted to ensure no potentially
significant cultural resources would be impacted
by the planned construction.
No artifacts were collected during these
investigations, thus there was no artifact curation;
however, as per the terms of the Antiquities
Permit, all project paperwork, field forms, and
photographs are curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory of the
University of Texas-Austin.
