Dead Man’s Hole
Presentation
January 24th Meeting
Claude Hudspeth will give a Power Point
presentation on a little known Chihuahua
Trail and Butterfield stage station in Jeff
Davis County.
This site is also known as El Muerto
Spring. It was so named because a man was
found dead in the spring in 1854.
Located 13 miles north of Valentine, this
unusual site has the remains of two stage
stations, one the Butterfield, the other, a post
Civil War Ben Ficklin Station. This location
was also used from time to time as an out
post by Fort Davis.
Also located at this site are numerous
prehistoric bed rock mortars, which indicate
El Muerto Spring was a well used camping
site long before its stage station days.
Roscoe Conkling said in 1935, when retracing and documenting the Butterfield
Trail, “ In spite of the sinister sounding
name, it would be difficult to find a lovelier
or more romantic location than the site of
this old mail station in the shadow of gloomy
El Muerto Peak.”

Grierson Spring Field Trip
January 26th
A field trip to Grierson Spring in
Reagan County, some 15 miles southwest
of Big Lake is set for Saturday, January
26th. This will be an all day affair, so bring
your lunch, drinks, and proper out door
gear, including good walking boots. (No
flip flops Sue)
Grierson Spring was located by U.S.
troops in the late 1860s. The location enabled the route from Ft. Concho to Ft.
Stockton to be shortened, thereby bypassing Horsehead Crossing. Ft. Concho established an outpost there in 1878 and maintained it until 1882. The telegraph line between the two forts also ran through Grierson Spring. There are numerous rock building ruins as well as two developed spring
boxes. Mendoza is believed to have
camped here in 1683.
.
Grierson Spring is located on private
property. Please, no metal detectors or artifact collecting.. Iraan (IRA) and Midland
Archeological Societies will be joining
CVAS for this rare opportunity to visit one
of Texas’s most Continued on page 2

interesting historic and pre-historic sites.
As a bonus, we have been invited to
IAS’s annual dinner in Iraan. Featured
speaker will be Dr. Grant Hall. His presentation will be on Rattlesnake Shelter near
Langtry. This will make a long day, but will
be well worth it for a great meal and a great
presentation by one of the most renowned
archeologists in the state.
Plans are to meet and leave the WalMart parking lot (behind Wendy’s) at 12
Noon on Saturday, the 26th. Car pooling is
encouraged.
Midland and Iraan Archeological Socities will meet at Best (9 miles west of Big
Lake) at 1:45 PM.
We expect to spend 3-31/2 hours at
Grierson Spring, then make the 53 mile
drive to Iraan. Those unable to attend the
Iraan function can leave the field trip at that
time. Check CVAS’s web site for up to
date information. www.cvassa.org

Archaeological Legacy
Institute
Friends and colleagues: Native American
tribes have suffered enormous losses of both
territory and cultural heritage in the course of
their dealings with the United States. A good
example of this past is that of the Nez Perce
Tribe, headquartered in Idaho, who relate their
history and their cultural pride in Surviving
Lewis & Clark: The Nimiipuu Story, the latest
video feature on our nonprofit streaming-media
Web site, The Archaeology Channel (http://
www.archaeologychannel.org).
This video covers the history of the Nez
Perce (or Nimiipuu in their own language) of
northwestern North America from the beginning to the present day as told from their perspective. Their encounter with American explorers Lewis and Clark 200 years ago and the
invasion of settlers, religious missionaries and
gold seekers led to the treaties of 1855, which
ultimately reduced their land base to about 10
percent of their original homeland area. This
work was written and produced by the Nez
Perce themselves.
This and other programs are available on
TAC for your use and enjoyment. We urge you
