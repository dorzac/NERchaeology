Abstract
Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC), Kyle, Texas, conducted a cultural resources reconnaissance
survey of 33.748-acre tract for the construction of a proposed power plant . The survey was conducted in
accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The
reconnaissance survey covered about 10 acres of the 33.748-acre tract on the west side of Knob Creek. Three
new historic archeological house sites were found. One isolated prehistoric artifact was found. About 23 acres
of plowed fields in the tract were visited and determined to be Low Probability Areas for cultural resources that
do not merit further inspection.
Site 41BL1257 contains buried nineteenth century features that could have research potential. The
eligibility status of any features at Site 41BL1258 is not yet known. For these reasons, the Panda Energy agrees
to avoid the house sites at Site 41BL1257 and Site 41BL1258. Site 41BL1259 does not contain archeological
deposits or features or archeological deposits that are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) and merits no additional work. No concentrations
of prehistoric materials were observed along Knob Creek. The isolated prehistoric artifact is a large displaced,
broken utilized flake of very low research value.
APC concludes that no significant cultural resources will be impacted by development of the 33.748acre tract. APC recommends that the new construction proceed with no additional work. Lastly, if any
unexpected cultural resources are uncovered during construction, work should stop and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. Activity should cease at the location
until the find is evaluated by an archeologist in consultation with the THC.

Cultural Resources Survey

Panda Energy Power Plant
1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

TITAN Engineering, Austin, Texas, on behalf of Panda Energy, contracted with Antiquities Planning
& Consulting (APC), Kyle, Texas, to conduct a cultural resources reconnaissance survey of a part of the
proposed Southeast Temple Industrial Park. The survey was conducted in accordance with the Texas
Antiquities Code and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The survey area was made up
about 10 acres of a 33.748-acre tract located on the west side of Knob Creek in the Southeast Temple
Industrial Park.
Three historic archeological sites (41BL1257, 41BL1258, and 41BL1259) and one isolated prehistoric
artifact were found. Site 41BL1257 consists of a late-nineteenth house site with features with medium to low
archeological research value. Site 41BL1258 consists of a nineteenth century house site and outbuildings with
unknown to low research value. Site 41BL1259 consists of a twentieth century house site with modern features
and has no archeological research value. Structures at all three locations were razed after 1995; their lots were
cleared, and subsurface features, such as cisterns, wells, privies, and/or cellars were filled in.
Site 41BL1257 contains buried features that could have research potential. The eligibility status of any
features at Site 41BL1258 is not yet known. Additional work at both sites could contribute new data about
local history. For these reasons, the Panda Energy agrees to avoid Site 41BL1257 and Site 41BL1258 house
sites. Site 41BL1259 does not contain archeological deposits or features that are eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) and merits no
additional work. No concentrations of prehistoric materials were observed along Knob Creek. The isolated
prehistoric artifact is a large displaced utilized flake of very low research value. The lack of surface materials
in plowed fields and along Knob Creek confirms that an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing is not
needed.
New construction and installation of utility lines should avoid the house sites at Site 41BL1257 and
Site 41BL1258. In the northwest part of the tract, any proposed buried utility line should be installed parallel
to and a minimum of 5 feet north of the abandoned nineteenth century road bed. New lines could also be
installed adjacent to existing lines, in piggyback fashion, inside the tract and none of the archeological sites
would be affected.
APC concludes that no significant cultural resources will be impacted by the proposed activity because
the developer agrees to avoid the house sites at Site 41BL1257 and Site 41BL1258. APC, therefore,
recommends that construction of the proposed Panda Energy, LLC, power plant in the Southeast Temple
Industrial Park. Lastly, if cultural resources are uncovered during construction, work should stop and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. Activity should cease at the
location until the find is evaluated by an archeologist in consultation with the THC.

2.0 PANDA ENERGY POWER PLANT

INTRODUCTION
Panda Energy proposes to construct a 1200 MW power plant in a 33.748-acre tract in the Southeast
Temple Industrial Park (Figure 1). A records search determined that no properties listed on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) fall inside or near the
proposed development. Historic quadrangle maps, highway maps, and aerial photographs were reviewed
during the desktop search. Maps and images show house and outbuilding locations that were present in the
northwestern portion of the tract. The structures were located on an abandoned nineteenth century east-to-west
unimproved road.
TITAN Engineering, on behalf of Panda Energy, contracted with APC to perform a reconnaissance
survey of the tract. The survey was conducted in accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code and the Minimal
Survey Standards. The purpose of the reconnaissance survey was to visit the house sites to examine the
locations for features and to evaluate their research value and eligibility status. The results were positive.
Instead of field work, additional investigation in the form of deed research was performed to establish a
chronology and preliminary chain of ownership of the tract. In addition, the flood plain was examined for
prehistoric materials. The findings were negative and it was determined an intensive pedestrian survey is not
needed.
PROJECT AREA
The survey area is semi-rural and is bounded on north and east by middle Knob Creek, on the west
by the railroad, and on the south by a property line (Figure 2). It is situated in a semi-rural setting, undergoing
urban growth. Historic and current land use is agricultural. With the exception of the residential tract and the
banks of Knob Creek, the tract has been intensively plowed. The terrain is level with low rises. The tract is
divided into fields, one residential parcel, and one undeveloped tract. The fields contain corn and coastal
bermuda grass crops (Figure 3). The residential tract sits in an area covered by Austin silty clay, 3 to 5 per cent
slope (Huckabee et al. 1972). Plowed fields are mantled Houston Black Clay, 1 to 3 per cent slope, with very
wide and deep shrink swell crack due to extreme drought. Soils along Knob Creek consist of Trinity Clay,
frequently flooded and are recent in age.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Panda Energy proposes to construct a 1200 megawatt power plant inside the tract. The depth of impact
will exceed one meter (3.28 feet) where the facility will be built. Underground utilities and a wastewater line
will be installed and could be buried about 1.22 meters deep (4 feet). The fields are level and little cut and fill
will be needed for the construction of roads, parking lots, and foundations. The FEMA-defined flood zone will
not be developed along Knob Creek.

Cultural Chronology
The project area is located is in the Central Texas archeological region (Prewitt 1981) and is known
to contain many historic and prehistoric sites. Recent archeological finds have shown the region has been
occupied for at least 12,000 years. Investigations in Central Texas have resulted in some detailed chronologies
for the region (Collins 2003; Prewitt 1980; Weir 1976). Table 1. lists Central Texas regional chronologies.

Previous Archeology
Many archeological studies have been performed in Bell County, including at Ft. Hood, Stillhouse
Hollow Lake, and recently, at the Gault Site. An archeological and geoarcheological survey was performed
in preparation for the Southeast Temple Water Line and Sanitary Improvements project (Kleinbach and Kibler
1996). The survey crossed the northern portion of the 33.478-acre tract, east to west, to the east side of Knob
Creek, where the line turns south. Two archeological sites were found and they are 41BL1096 and 41BL1097.
Site 41BL1096 is located across the creek to the east of the current survey area and 41BL1097 is not in the
tract and is located upstream on Knob Creek.
Site 41BL1096 is a prehistoric open campsite situated in a plowed field at elevation 608 ft. above
mean sea level (amsl). It measures 80 m by 40 m with the long axis at southwest to northeast and is made up
of a light density artifact scatter. A quartzite mano or hand-held grinding stone, fire-cracked rock fragments,
and stone tool shipping debris were observed on the surface. Shovel testing was negative, indicating that the
deposits are surficial. Soils consist of deep, calcareous Houston Black Clay Loam, 1 to 3 percent slope, formed
from Cretaceous parent material. Plowing has disturbed the deposits at the site and it was judged to have low
research value and to be ineligible for listing in the NRHP and/or as a SAL. No further work was conducted
and the utility line was installed inside the site.
Site 41BL1097 is a prehistoric open campsite situated in a plowed field at elevation 580 ft amsl. It
measures 130 m by 30 m and is made up of a moderate density artifact scatter. Fire-cracked rock fragments,
and stone tool shipping debris were observed on the surface. Shovel testing was positive to a depth of 5 cm,
indicating that the deposits are surficial. Soils consist of deep, calcareous Houston Black Clay Loam, 1 to 3
percent slope, formed from Cretaceous parent material. Plowing has disturbed the deposits at the site and it
was judged to have no research value and to be ineligible for listing in the NRHP and/or as a SAL. No further
work was conducted and the utility line was installed inside the site.
Research Direction
The research purpose of the reconnaissance survey is to collect new data about the cultural history and
prehistory of the tract proposed for development. The goals of the survey are multi-fold. The first is to evaluate
house sites present to ascertain age, condition, and eligibility status. The second is to examine the flood plain
of Knob Creek for surficial prehistoric deposits in order to determine if an intensive pedestrian survey with
shovel testing is warranted.
Methods
APC obtained Antiquities Permit Number 4993 for the survey from the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) before starting work. During desktop study for the project, APC
reviewed records from the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the THC, and Texas State Library (TSL). Site
files and pertinent archeological literature were reviewed. Maps and indices were checked and it was determined
that no historic properties listed on the NRHP, SALs, and/or recorded sites are located inside the project area.

The reconnaissance survey was conducted by 1-2 archeologists and covered about 10 of the 33.748
acres or about 30 percent of the project area. The scope included the pedestrian inspection of a total of about.
4 acres at historic locales. A combination of a wind shield survey and a pedestrian survey was performed along
the creek bank and at flood plain rises and/or High Probability Areas (HPAs) inside the project area, covering
about 6 acres.
Systematic shovel testing and/or backhoe trenching were not conducted. Surface visibility at house sites
were 40 percent and in the plowed fields in the flood plain, visibility ranged from 50 to 100 percent. All soils
exhibited extreme shrink swell cranks due to drought. Low Probability Areas (LPAs) were not examined. No
temporally or stylistically diagnostic artifacts were found or collected for laboratory analysis or curation.
When newly found archeological deposits were encountered during the reconnaissance survey, routine
documentation procedures were followed. No shovel tests were preformed at the new sites because surface
visibility exceeds 40 percent and because the locales had been leveled by machinery. A TexSite Form was
completed for each new site. The site data were entered into the Texas Archeological Site Atlas electronic
database. APC described areal extent, depth, artifact content, and any potential for significant and/or intact
deposits. Field notes completed included field maps and artifact sketches.
In addition, limited archival and historic research was performed to establish chronology and chain of
ownership for the tract. Occupants of the two of the three structures are not yet known. Data analysis,
interpretation, and findings are summarized in this technical report that follows Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) standards. Site data will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, the University
of Texas At Austin.

4.0 RESULTS
The results of the reconnaissance survey were positive and contributed new archeological and historical
data about local and regional history, and to a very limited extent, prehistory. Three new archeological sites
were found and consist of historic house sites (Table 2). The locations represent the remains of two late
nineteenth and one twentieth century house sites that were demolished in the late 1990s. One isolated
prehistoric artifact was found on Knob Creek. It was displaced and not part of a concentration or an
archeological site.
The research value of the archeological deposits at Site 41BL1257 is medium to low due to
disturbance. Site 41BL1257 may have nineteenth century subterranean features that could contribute new data
and may be eligible. The presence/absence and research value of any subsurface features present at Sites 2 is
not yet known. Site 41BL1259 deposits have low research value due to their modern age. The eligibility
status of Site 41BL1258 is not yet known and needs more work. Site 41BL1259 is ineligible for listing in the
NRHP and/or as SALs and merits no further archeological investigation. The prehistoric artifact has no
research value, except to indicate the possible presence of prehistoric groups on the east side of Knob Creek.
Negative prehistoric findings indicate that the east side of Knob Creek inspected was not selected by prehistoric
groups for occupation or temporary use with frequency.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES
The three historic house sites are associated with a late nineteenth century road and a small farming
community on the west side of Knob Creek. The road ran east to west and crossed the creek where it ended at
a house site. The farming community was in Precinct 4 of Bell County and had a well established population
by 1880, according to census records. For this reason, it is believed that the road was in use by 1880 and the
house sites were occupied by 1890. Aerial photos and topographic maps show that the road was in use in
1972, but out of use by 1990.
Site 41BL1257
Site 41BL1257 is the remains of a nineteenth century farm house occupied ca. 1880 or 1890-1997
(Figure 4). The house sat on the west side of a lot that measured about 100 feet by 100 feet. Aerial photos
show that the house was square with a pyramidal roof and it was probably 30-40 feet by 30-40 feet. It likely
sat on top of cedar footings. One feature was observed and it is a depression from a cistern, well, cellar, or cess
pool. Feature 1 was present outside the house, to the southwest. Today, it is caved in and filled with demolition
rubble, including cement steps. The feature is about 4 feet deep and marked by blue flags. It is round at the
top and appears to narrow with depth. It has a ceramic lining is visible and could be the remains of a bellshaped cistern or hand-dug well. To the south east of the house, is a wooden tower for an elevated water tank
No artifacts were observed. The house was demolished and the lot cleared sometime after 1997. No shovel
testing was performed due disturbance and 40 percent surface visibility.
The research value of the archeological deposits at Site 41BL1257 is medium to low. The remaining
nineteenth century feature, has been disturbed and filled with garbage from the razed house. The upper part
of the feature is destroyed; the lower portion is intact. It has an unusual characteristic, in that it appears to be
lined with ceramic (over brick?), making it a cistern? (Figure 5). In addition, its shape is large however, to be
the top of a cistern, and it could be a cellar entrance. The feature’s function is not yet known and it merits
additional work and therefore, avoidance.

chain of ownership of
the house is
only partly known and it
is affiliated
with early residents of
southeast Bell
County. How early, is
not yet known,
raising historic research
interest in the site. The upper 2-3 feet of the feature observed at Site 41BL1257 is disturbed. The lower
portion,
could be intact, and so
the feature
will be avoided. If this
feature is a
cellar, other potentially
i n t a c t
subsurface features will
be present
that were common in
t

nineteenth centur y
including a
cistern or well and
privies. If
a ddit iona l a r c hiva l
work shows
that the house was pre

scientific excavation of
the feature
might be warranted
before filling
the feature in.

Site
41BL1258
S i t e
41BL1258 is the former
location of two
structures and existing
o u t b u ildings
(Figure 6). Aerial
photos show the
two structures adjacent
to the road bed

occupied from
ca. 1880 or 1890 to
about 1980.It
a ppea r s tha t the
segment of the
road to Site 41BL1258
and the east side of the creek was abandoned between 1972 and 1990. No structural remains or artifacts were
observed at these loci during the survey. To the south of the house locale is a complex of outbuildings. A small
barn in ruins with trap pens (Figure 7, Top), a calf feeder and trough, and a standing garage (Figure 7, Bottom)

for a tractor are present. To the east of the barn are wooden foundations for other structures and erected cedar
posts, that could also have been a chicken coop or an early residence. The reason for this thought is that bed
springs were found near one foundation. Components of the buildings are hand-notched cedar posts. Notching
is a nineteenth century practice that continued until the mid-twentieth century.
No shovel testing was performed due 40-60 percent surface visibility. Site 41BL1258 was originally
thought to be outbuildings for Site 41BL1257, however; 1972 aerial photos show a structure was present to
the north of the outbuildings. The structure was there in 1957, and it is not yet known if it was nineteenth or
twentieth century in origin. It faced, and was set slightly back from, the nineteenth century road to Knob Creek,
and so it is presumed to be a nineteenth century house site. The presence and/or research value of the
archeological deposits are not yet known, nor is the age. Therefore, the eligibility of the house site for listing
in the NRHP and/or as SALs is not yet known and it should be avoided. Additional work is warranted at the
house site locale, if avoidance is not possible in the form of shovel testing around the structures and archival
and historic research.
The outbuildings are not nineteenth century in age and are ineligible for listing in the NRHP or as
SALs. The barn and calf feeder are modern and are in ruins. The tractor garage is extant and is earlier in age
than the barn and the feeder, and is probably early twentieth century. It contains tractor parts, tires, and
abandoned pieces of household furniture in a side room. The objects date from the 1900s to 1940s,
approximately. These buildings do not need to be avoided and can be demolished.

Site 41BL1259 is the remains of a twentieth century residence that appears to date to the 1950s-1990s.
(Figure 8). The house covered about 30 ft by 20 feet and sat in the north central portion of the lot which
measured about 80 feet by 80 feet. Topographic maps show a large structure with an ell in the northeast
corner. Aerial photographs show a rectangular structure and the remaining concrete foundation (20 ft by 30
feet) is also rectangular. The concrete has modern bolt attachments.
Four additional features were observed and they are a concrete septic tank, a concrete swimming pool,
native stone and concrete picnic table, and limestone barbecue pit (Figure 9). Modern trash and trash in burn
barrels were observed in the site and around the features. Site 41BL1259 is thought to represent the 1975-1997
occupation of the tract. No shovel testing was performed due 40 percent surface visibility and due to the
modern age of the features and materials.
The twentieth century component may have obscured an earlier occupation. It is possible Site
41BL1259 is a multi-component historic site and that it once had a nineteenth century house on it, that was
replaced in the mid-twentieth century. The research value of the site related to Knob Creek settlement is
medium; however; deposits are modern do not have archeological research value. Site 41BL1259 is judged
to be ineligible for listing the NRHP or as an SAL, and merits no further investigation. Since it is possible that
a nineteenth century structure preceded the twentieth century component, additional archival work is merited
in the future to refine chronology and ownership.

In sum, the northwest corner of the 33.748-acre tract contains the locations of three historic house
sites, two are nineteenth century in age and one is twentieth century. The houses were situated on an east-west
unimproved road that lead to Knob Creek and to a fourth house on the east side of the Creek. Intact nineteenth
century features may be present at Site 41BL1257 and Site 41BL1258 that have unknown research value and
for that reason, the locales will be avoided and will not be developed (Figure 10).

ARCHIVAL AND HISTORICAL RESEARCH
Preliminary archival and historical research results provided a tentative chronology and overview of
the ownership of the tract back to 1918 and a possible age of the farming community on middle Knob Creek
back to 1880 (Table 3). Deeds listed ownership information and census data confirmed the presence or absence
of owners in Precinct 4 of Bell County, the census precinct in which the 33.478-acre tract is located. The tract
was owned by Richard M. and Maud Reeves in 1918 and probably earlier.
Census data place Richard in Bell County Precinct 4 in 1900 as the 17 year old son o Oscar. The
Reeves were not in the present in 1880. However, other landowner names are listed in the 4th precinct in Bell
County in 1880, including the Lewellen family and Annie H. Young-Almon and family. It is likely the
nineteenth century houses were constructed between the 1880s-1890s. It is presumed that the landowners
occupied the house at Site 41BL1257. Names of the occupants of the houses at Site 41BL1258 and 41BL1259
are not yet known.
The house sites are not shown on nineteenth century maps, but are seen on later maps and aerial
photos, however; the nineteenth century maps do not illustrate the locations of structures. Deed
d a t a
collected contains gaps in twentieth century dates and pre 1900 data were not located during the preliminary
effort. For these reasons, its age is not yet known, but, it is estimated to be after 1942. The possibility does
exist that a nineteenth century house was previously present at the location, but current remains are modern.
In addition to deed and census data, historic maps and aerial photographs were reviewed. A chronologic group

of illustrations was compiled showing the elements of the project area in 1890 (Figure 11), 1944 and 1957
(Figure 12), 1972 (Figure 13), and 1990 (Figure 14).

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCLUSIONS
The results of Panda Energy, LLC, Power Plant reconnaissance survey and historical research
contributed new historic information and showed that proposed development inside the northwest corner of the
tract could affect any subterranean nineteenth century features present at Site 41BL1257 and Site 41BL1258.
For this reason, Panda Energy agrees to impose development constraints in the northwest portion of the tract,
to ensure the house site locations are avoided. Site 41BL1259 is ineligible an mid-to-late twentieth century
house site is outside the area planned for development. Based on the survey and research findings, APC
concludes that no cultural resources are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historical Places or as
State Archeological Landmarks will be affected.
The findings also contributed new data about the culture history and prehistory of the middle Knob
Creek drainage of southeast Bell County. Historic sites were found clustered around a nineteenth century
unimproved road that leads to a low water crossing of Knob Creek. The houses sites, with others to the west,
made up a farming community dating from ca. 1880-1995. Prehistoric sites were not found on the west side
of the creek, in contrast to the east side, where one is present These finds suggest the middle Knob Creek was
selected infrequently, by prehistoric groups for temporary activity areas.
RECOMMENDATIONS
APC recommends that construction of the proposed Panda Energy Power Plant in the Southeast
Temple Industrial Park proceed with constraints to avoid the house sites at Site 41BL1257 and Site
41BL1258. Lastly, if cultural resources are uncovered during construction, work should stop. The Texas
Historical Commission (THC) should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. Activity should cease at the
location until the find is evaluated by an archeologist in consultation with the THC.
