ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING AT THE
CASWELL HOUSE, AUSTJN,. TEXAS
Kenne'th' M. Brown
From February 28 to March 2; 1977, the Texas Archeological Survey
conducted test excavations at the Daniel Caswell house along
selected points on the proposed route of a future drain system
that will run along the base of the foundations, exiting at the
front or east side of the house. Six 3x5 foot test pits were ex­
cavated, three adjacent to the house, one on the principal (east)
exit route, and two on the alternate (west) exit route. Location
of the test pits is shown on the attached measured sketch.
The test pits adjacent to the house uncovered debris and distur­
bances related to construction of the house itself, but no evidence
of pre-existing or related structures; the area next to the north
wall has been disturbed by construction of a recent~concrete but­
tress. Testing in the front yard showed that the drain route has
already been disrupted by a recent PVC.pipeline. The tests in the
back (west) yard uncovered packed gravel fills, perhaps part of a
driveway or a floor, but no definite structural remains. A chipped
stone tool and a small amount of chipping debris were also recovered
from this area, but leveling and filling operations have probably
displaced or buried what little prehistoric debris may be present.
In summary arc~eological testing has revealed that part of the
proposed drain route has already been disturbed, and no structural
remains were uncovered in the areas tested. The proposed con­
struction is therefore expected to have no adverse effects on
archeological remains at the Caswell House.
Further details on the test excavations can be found in the
attached summary report. Field notes and photographs are on file
at the Texas Archeological Survey, Balcones Research Center •

Test Pit 1
Located adjacent to the north wall where the corner turret joins
the wall, this unit is 3xS feet with long axis north~south. The
southern part of the unit has been disturbed by a concrete buttress
placed at the foot of the wall after its collapse in 1968. In the
rest of the unit, several layers of fill and building debris, dip­
ping southward, extend to 1.0-2.2 feet below the surface. The
building debris includes sand, mortar fragments, nails (round,
square), and many small fragments of slate from trimming of roofing
material. Animal bones were recovered but are somewhat less abun­
dant than in Test Pit 2. The upper foot of fill was screened
through ~-inch mesh; further exc~vation to 2.6 feet was done without
screening.

Test Pit 2
Located adjacent to the west wall of the north wing~and the north
wall of the stone foundation for a wooden kitchen addition, this
unit is also 3xS feet with long axis nqJth-south. Excavation re- .
vealed the original foundation trench', about 1.0-1.2 feet wide, with
a layer of yellow clay about ~-foot thick banked against the outside
of the trench near the top. A number of animal bones, some flower­
pot sherds, building debris, window gl~ss, and various metal objects
were found.
Maximum depth of this unit is 17 inches.
Test Pit 3
This unit is 3x5 feet with the long axis east-west, parallel to the
front wall of the house and one foot south of it; the south wall of
the test pit is 11.75 feet from the step at the end of the walk.
Excavation uncovered two l~-inch PVC pipelines laid parallel to the
walk and south of it, at a depth of 5 inches. Excavation was discon­
tinued at this depth because of the obvious evidence of disturbance.
Roofing slate fragments were noted in the fill. Fill was partially
screened.
Test Pit 4
This unit is 3xS feet, oriented east-west, parallel to and 20 inches
away from the south wall of the house next to the front porch. Ex­
cavation uncovered a thick (4-5 inches) stratum of sand and large
mortar fragments overlain by clay and clay loam; large roofing slate
fragments were common. This building debris deposit extended nearly
to the base of the test pit, 16 inches deep. Nails, animal bones,
sheet metal, and a 1966 license plate were recovered.

5 and 6

-Both of these units are west of the "summer house", with the south
wall of both aligned with the north edge of the summer house; the
east wall of unit 6 is 10.85 feet from the summer house. Test Pit
5 is 3x5 feet, and Test Pit 6 is 3x4 feet with a I foot balk sepa­
rating the two. A gravel surface with scattered small limestone
chunks was uncovered in unit 5 at a depth of about 9 inches near
the east wall. In unit 6 coarse gravel fill was found from about
4-7 inches below the surface. These gravel layers were compact
and may indicate some sort of driveway or other prepared surface.
Recent animal bones and two chert flakes were recovered from these
units. Unit 5 was screened, unit 6 unscreened.
General Observations
Building debris was abundant immediately adjacent 10 the house but
less common away from it. Fragments of roofing slate are so common
that it appears likely that large sheets of fissile slate were
brought to the building S1 te and spli.t and trimmed' there.
Animal bones, most with saw marks, are especially common in unit
2, which adj oins the kitchen. The real."...-of the house was probably
a refuse disposal area; some bones were also recovered in units 1
and 4, however.
