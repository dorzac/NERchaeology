ABSTRACT

During the later part of June of 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of approximately 20 acres of
the proposed High School #5 tract on which a school and related activity
areas will be constructed. The survey was done for Pinnacle
Environmental which is doing the environmental permitting for the
Mansfield Independent School District which intends to construct the
school. The study area is located west of and adjacent to South Day Miar
Road and north of Low Branch in southeastern Tarrant County, Texas.
Since Mansfield Independent School District is a political entity of the
State of Texas, the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission issued Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4953 for the
archaeological survey.
No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface
during the survey or uncovered during 16 shovel tests. The absence of
historic sites may be due to the preference to use the land for farming. The
absence of prehistoric sites is attributed to the low biotic diversity and
absence of perennial water which might be obtained further east and closer
to Mountain Creek where numerous sites have been recorded.
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted
and that the Mansfield Independent School District be allowed to construct
the school and related activity areas. Also, we recommend that if buried
cultural resources are uncovered during construction, construction should
cease immediately in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be notified. Work should not continue until
the necessary discussions with the Texas Historical Commission have
been conducted.

INTRODUCTION
The Mansfield Independent School District intends to construct High School #5 and
associated activity areas on approximately 55 acres north of Low Branch and west of and
adjacent to South Day Miar Road in southeastern Tarrant County, Texas. After a review,
the Archeology Division, in a letter dated May 9, 2008, requested that the southern onethird of the property (about 20 acres) north of Low Branch be archaeologically surveyed.
The twenty acres are located west of and adjacent to South Day Miar Road about 1,248
feet north of the intersection of South Day Miar Road and Tangle Ridge Drive and north
of Low Branch (Figure 1).
The purpose of the investigation was to determine if cultural resources are present in the
proposed construction areas and to make recommendations about their archaeological
significance, how they might be impacted by development and to place the discovered
cultural resources in a regional context. Antiquities permit number 4953 was issued to
AR Consultants, Inc. to do this survey since the Mansfield Independent School District is
a political entity of the State of Texas and the Antiquities Code of Texas applies to this
investigation.
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report contains a brief description of the
natural environment and then a summary of previous archaeological investigations in the
area as known from published sources. This is followed by the research design and the
methodology. The description of the results of the field investigation constitutes the
major part of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the
study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Tarrant County is located in North Central Texas. The county consists mainly of
undulating to hilly land and vegetation consists of tall grasses and various species of trees
such as mesquite, elm, oak, pecan and walnut. The sandy loams in the Western Cross
Timbers drain into the West Fork of the Trinity River. Streams in the Blackland Prairie,

in which the study area lies (Dyksterhuis 1946:Figure 1), drain into the upper tributaries
of the West Fork of the Trinity River.
The study area is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous-aged Eagle Ford Formation (Bureau
of Economic Geology 1972) which consists of shale. Low Branch is not mapped as
containing Quaternary alluvium.
Soils in the study area belong to the Houston Black-Navo-Heiden Association which are
gently sloping upland clays and loams (Ressel 1981:General Soils Map). Soils within the
study area are mapped as Heiden clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes and Houston Black clay
with 1 to 3 percent slopes. A narrow band of eroded Ferris clay with 5 to 12 percent
slopes separate the soils (Ressel 1981:Inset 59).
Low Branch is mapped as perennial on the USGS map but intermittent on the Soil Map
for Tarrant County, Texas. Low Branch flows into Mountain Creek near its headwaters;
therefore, it is a part of the Mountain Creek watershed.
Fauna are varied and abundant with at least 49 species of mammals, 39 species of snakes,
17 species of reptiles and other species (Blair 1950:101–102). Common forms of fauna
include deer, raccoon, opossum, rabbit, lizards and turtles. Armadillos have invaded the
area within the past 50 years. Various authors, including Lynott (1979), believed that the
prairie was inhabited by now extinct bison and antelope.
Prikryl (1993:192-193) suggested that prior to 12,000 B.C., the climate of North Central
Texas was cooler and moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 BC, the climate
became warmer and this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. He adds
that the presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550 to1050 BC
indicate a drying with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 BC. The later change is
similar to today’s environment. High grass pollen also occurred at approximately AD 450
and from AD 1550 to 1650, and this also indicates drier periods. The presence of
paleosols between AD 1 and 1000 suggested an increase in moisture during this period
with a return to drier conditions after AD 1000.

ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE MOUNTAIN CREEK WATERSHED
Cultural historical investigations in the Mountain Creek Basin upstream from the junction
of the West Fork of the Trinity river began more than fifty years ago with the survey and
recording of numerous prehistoric archaeological sites by members of the Dallas
Archeological Society (DAS) such as R. K. Harris (1936). More recent work was done in
conjunction with construction of the Joe Pool Lake which was originally termed
Lakeview Lake. The work was done under the direction of the Archaeology Research
Program at Southern Methodist University (SMU), except for some Historic
Architectural Buildings Survey (HABS) work at the Penn site that was done by
Environment Consultants (1984) and completed by AR Consultants. This work is briefly
summarized below, but the reader is referred to the original reports for additional
information.

The initial lake site survey was done in 1977-78 and resulted in the locating and
recording of 17 prehistoric archaeological sites and 25 historic archaeological/ standing
structure sites (Skinner and Connors 1979). Many of these sites had previously been
recorded by DAS members who surveyed the Mountain Creek area in the 1940s. Based
on the survey findings, it was hypothesized that prehistoric settlement in the area was of a
seasonal nature and was limited by water availability. Moreover, based on the apparent
abundance of chert lithics, rather than quartzite lithics more commonly found at sites
along the main stem of the Trinity River, it was concluded that the residents were from
the Brazos River Basin rather than from the closer Trinity River area.
In 1979 and 1980, SMU and a team from North Texas State University (now the
University of North Texas) tested for buried sites at Joe Pool Lake. They also tested the
already recorded sites in order to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places, as well as to assess the impact that construction would have
on the various sites, and to offer a series of resource management recommendations
(Raab et al. 1982:1).
Prehistoric testing focused on the Cobb-Pool site which appeared to contain a possible
pithouse and associated features and refuse deposits dating to the period A.D. 800-1200.
Work at the site suggested that Cobb-Pool was part of a settlement pattern based on
exploitation of a range of resources provided by greater effective moisture than in the
project area today.
Mitigation activities at the Joe Pool Lake were carried out by SMU between 1984-1986
and are reported in two monographs (Peter and McGregor editors 1988; Jurney, Lebo and
Green 1988). Excavation was done at six prehistoric sites including the Late Prehistoric
period Cobb-Pool and Baggett Branch sites, and three sites with primarily Late Archaic
occupations. Cobb-Pool was shown to represent a horticultural community occupied in
the first half of the 13th century. Baggett Branch had a late occupation characterized by
the presence of bison, Plains-style artifacts, and shell-tempered pottery similar to the type
Nocona Plain. The authors concluded that the Late Archaic and Early Late Prehistoric
occupation of the area was on a seasonal basis, primarily during the summer (Peter and
McGregor 1988:363-364). The Cobb-Pool site is the only evidence of Middle Late
Prehistoric occupation and may indicate year-round occupation. The Late Late
Prehistoric period occupation was probably seasonal.
During the 1980s, SMU personnel and the DAS conducted studies in the area. Survey of
a sanitary sewer route along Baggett Branch was done for the Lake Ridge Development
Company (Peter and McGregor 1987). One previously recorded prehistoric site
(41DL135) was relocated and a separate prehistoric artifact locality was noted. Both
deposits were shallow and small. It was recommended that the route avoid site 41DL135
as it was considered to be an example of a short-term foraging camp. The DAS and SMU
personnel had previously tested two other sites (41DL137 and 41EL33) located along the
upland drainages of the White Rock Escarpment (Peter and McGregor 1988:367; Hartig
1988). The Lester Lorch site (41DL137) is situated adjacent to a known spring where an

unnamed tributary issues forth from the White Rock Escarpment. Artifacts from the site
included Middle and Late Archaic dart points, snub-nosed end scrapers, bone tools and
beads, at least one incised sherd, drilled mussel shells, and arrow points. Many of the
chipped stone tools, particularly the dart points and snub-nosed end scrapers, are made on
fine grain quartzite which characterizes the Late Archaic assemblages from Joe Pool
Lake and the Trinity River. The Hollings Branch site (41EL33) is situated approximately
five meters above the creek channel on a level bench and covers an area estimated to be
85 m by 25-30 m. The deposit is confined to the upper 20-30 cm below the present
ground surface. The site is different from Lester Lorch in that only a few arrow points
were recovered along with a few pieces of mussel shell, fire-cracked rock, and lithic
debris. Hundreds of pieces of animal bone are the most common artifact class. Peter
(1998) suspected that these sites may have been occupied during the summer when the
tree cover would have provided protection from the direct sun.
More recently, AR Consultants conducted several surveys in the Mountain Creek basin.
The Pleasant Valley Golf Course survey (Skinner, Lindsay, and Young 1992) located no
prehistoric sites. The second investigation was the survey of 560 acres included at the site
of the Veterans Administration National Cemetery of North Texas located east of
Mountain Creek Lake at the base of the White Rock Escarpment (Skinner, Whorton, and
Dillon 1995). No prehistoric sites were located. Survey of the Grand Prairie Business
Park at the junction of Mountain Creek and the West Fork of the Trinity did not locate
any sites on the surface or in the levee along the West Fork (Kent, Skinner and Trask
1998). Survey of the Cedar Mountain Preserve for the City of Cedar Hill located no
prehistoric sites in the valley or on the slopes and top of the Escarpment Kent and
Skinner 1998a). Survey of the proposed Sunset Ranch development (Skinner 1998)
located four prehistoric site deposits (41EL233-235) on the benches above Hollings
Creek downstream from the Hollings Branch site. Broken large mammal bones were the
most common artifacts found in the midden deposits which ranged from 15 to 30 m in
diameter. Additional artifacts included chert lithic debris and fire-cracked rock. None of
these sites were dated but the presence of charcoal and animal bone should allow for
dating and environmental reconstruction. Recently, a buried ash lens was discovered in
the bank of Baggett Branch a meter below the present ground surface and several
hundred meters downstream from the Baggett Branch site. No artifacts were recovered
but an ash/charcoal sample and a fractured large mammal long bone were radiocarbon
dated (Skinner and Todd 2007). The ash dated 320±40 BP (Beta 225641) and the bone
dated 390±40 BP (Beta 225640).

Using the above temporal framework, the following paragraphs present a brief
description of the culture history of the area.
The Paleo-Indian period is distinguished by projectile point styles attributed to this
period. Many of the points are made of cherts that are not native to North Central Texas.
The Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site in Denton County are the only excavated
Paleo-Indian sites in the region (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001), and both are on
the Elm Fork to the north. Surface artifacts generally come from deposits on stream
terraces above the level of the active floodplain. This is a period when large mammals
became extinct, and their extinction is attributed in part to a general environmental
drying.
During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream
terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there
was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. Middle Archaic sites
are predominantly found on the first terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites
tend to be along the Elm Fork rather than along the smaller tributaries. The population
density continued to be low. Late Archaic sites increase in number over the previous
period, and sites are located both along the Elm Fork and its tributaries. There appears to
be a strong shift in site location to tributary streams, and a pronounced population
explosion. Within the Elm Fork basin, local Ogallala quartzite was being used
prominently at this time, and this observation is taken by some authors (Skinner 1981;
Prewitt 1983) as evidence of increased territorial constriction. On Mountain Creek, it
appears that the earliest occupation was during the Late Archaic, and that occupation was
only on a seasonal, not year-round basis. Moreover, unlike the Elm Fork and most of
Dallas County, lithics are predominantly cherts which may have been secured to the
southwest near Alvarado (McGregor 1995).
During the Late Prehistoric period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact
assemblages (Shafer 1977). Houses and evidence of agriculture first appear during this
period, as shown at the Cobb-Pool site. Early Late Prehistoric site locations mirror those
of the Late Archaic, and chert continued as the common material for chipped stone
projectiles and tools within the Mountain Creek basin. The West Fork Paleosol is
tentatively dated to this period, although it has been dated earlier that A.D. 800 in some
places (Ferring 1990). Drying continued into the subsequent period. Buffalo bones are
common in Late Late Prehistoric sites (Dillehay 1974; Lynott 1979; Peter and McGregor
1988a:241), along with tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains.
Protohistoric Native American occupation in the Dallas County is reported by numerous
regional history authors. Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American
occupation has been found in the area (Peter, Cliff, and Green 1996:2). This pattern of
finding virtually no physical evidence of historic Native American in the form of artifacts

[beads, gun-flints, cooking utensils, etc.] is seen throughout much of North Central Texas
(Skinner 1988), and has been related to the abandonment of the region in the 1500/1600s
caused by a major regional drought.
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, according to some historical
documents, the aboriginal inhabitants of North Central Texas continued to play an
infamous if not important role in the history of that region. Very little archaeological
evidence, however, of historic Native American occupation has been found in the North
Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas, and one which has been
suggested is due to the inability of the Native Americans to adapt to the changing climate
(Skinner 1988).
The 1830s and 1840s were decades of Anglo expansion into North Central Texas. Garrett
(1972:24), a well-respected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities almost
depopulated North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than half".
According to tradition, many Indians of several tribes roamed the region until well into
the 1860s. Strategies for dealing with the illusive aboriginal population ranged from
armed confrontation and pursuit to across-the-table dialogue. Rising from a domestic
background of dealing with Indians, President of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston,
realized rapprochement was preferable to direct confrontation. In the summer of 1843, a
council with the Indians was called, and in September of that year ten tribes signed a
treaty which was approved by the Senate the following January. The treaty provided the
needed impetus for settlement of several counties in the North-Central Texas area. The
earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around 1840,
and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove, located near present-day
Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). The
county itself was organized in 1850, but it was not until 1860 that Fort Worth was
officially named the county seat, that designation having been transferred from Birdville
(Webb 1952:708). Settlers, however, had been steadily arriving in the county during
those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although
only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57).
In 1849, Major Ripley Allan Arnold was assigned to build a military post on the upper
Trinity in the largely uninhabited geographical region of the Grand Prairie and the
Eastern Cross Timbers. This encampment was established on a high bluff overlooking the
confluence of the West and Clear Forks of the Trinity River. Within a short length of
time, there were about 12 double log cabins near the fort, and life in Fort Town definitely
had its refinements (Garrett 1972:80). The fort as a military post was relatively shortlived due to the continual westward movement of the frontier. In September of 1853,
troops abandoned the barracks and parade ground to the local population.
The Civil War took its toll on Tarrant County's population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. Fort Worth's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. By the end of the nineteenth century,

Fort Worth had shed its "six-shooter" culture for a more refined cow town culture which
was beginning to use its past to advantage.
Oil was the next great influence on the life of Fort Worth. Fort Worth became the
gateway to the West Texas oil fields (Knight 1990:192) and both fed the population and
served as an impetus for post-World War II industrial development. The Convair plant
and Tarrant Field (later Carswell Field) had played an important role during the war, and
rather than lose their jobs the employees were retained to work on a secret project, the B36. Once again, Fort Worth became a focal point for an industry as she had for so many
decades.
The first steam-powered gristmill in the county, and possibly the state, was built in
southeastern Tarrant County. The settlement that grew up around the gristmill became
Mansfield (originally spelled Mansfeild after the co-owner of the grist mill and owner of
the merchandise store). By 1860, Mansfield had a post office, and several businesses, and
by the late 1860s, a college. The town continued to prosper as a rural city, but became a
modern suburb as people flocked to Mansfield to live and to work in Fort Worth. Several
manufacturing industries, such as the Carnation Company, moved into Mansfield
increasing its growth into Ellis County, Texas (Hart 2004).
Previous Investigations
No archaeological sites were listed within or adjacent to the study area on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (2008). However, according to the Atlas, the Low Branch’s
channel was surveyed during the Joe Pool project and no archaeological sites were
recorded.
Two archaeological surveys along Walnut Creek were conducted approximately 5 miles
northwest of the survey area. AR Consultants (Skinner and Whorton 1994) performed the
archaeological survey for the Kathryn Rose Memorial Park. Thirty-one acres were
investigated and no archaeological sites were found. AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and
Skinner 2004) conducted an archaeological survey west of and adjacent to Kathryn Rose
Memorial Park. Approximately 19 acres and about 1,100 feet of trail route were
investigated. No archaeological sites were seen on the ground surface or found in 16
shovel tests. AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2007) investigated approximately 4,500 feet of
pipeline route that crosses Low Branch and a lift station south of Low Branch adjacent to
South Holland Road about 4,070 feet northwest of the study area. No cultural materials
older than 50 years were found on the ground surface or uncovered in 6 shovel tests.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The purpose of the research design was to insure that fieldwork would make a
contribution to the better understanding of prehistoric and historic settlement in the area.
Two research problems are presented below.
______________________________________________________________________________________
AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HIGH SCHOOL#5 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY

Based upon previous experience in the area, prehistoric sites are unlikely
to be present due to the low biotic diversity and absence of perennial
water.
Also, historic residences may be present along the roadway above
flooding.
An even more basic, research problem guided the survey; simply stated the question
asked, “How did past people use the land, and what record of this use did they leave
behind?”
Most frequently, small-scale surveys of this type gather information in response to this
more open-ended research question, which guides almost all archaeological surveys.
Methodology
The surveyor, armed with plats of the survey area and USGS and soil maps, walked the
proposed school tract in north-south oriented transects spaced 30 meters apart. The
Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) recommends that 10 shovel tests be excavated
within 20 acres and this recommendation was exceeded. Shovel tests were excavated to
approximately 30 centimeters below the surface. The clay matrices were broken manually
and visually examined for cultural materials as were the pit walls. Areas with greater than
30 percent ground visibility and that had been mechanically disturbed were not shovel
tested. Notes on the terrain, vegetation and other relevant material were made and
photographs were taken.
Backhoe trenches were not excavated due to upland setting where a well-developed
floodplain in which buried cultural deposits would be preserved is not present.

RESULTS
The results section is divided into various parts. The survey area (approximately 20 acres)
is described first, followed by a description of the survey and the conclusions portion
ends the chapter. Shovel tests are described generally in the text but specific information
is provided in Table 1. Shovel test locations are plotted on Figure 5.
Survey area
The survey area consists mostly of generally level wheat field (Figure 2) where the
ground visibility ranged from less than 10 to 30 percent. At the study area’s southern end,
the terrain gently slopes (Figure 3) for approximately 72 meters before terminating at a
second fence. It appears that the land has been terraced (Figure 4). This portion of the
study area is unimproved pasture and the understory vegetation includes wheat, grama
grasses, puff weed and other grass species. Young mesquite, eastern red cedar, hackberry

and elm trees are scattered on the slope and are present about a tree thick along fence
lines. Ground visibility ranged from less than 10 to 20 percent.

The survey
The survey area was bounded by fences on the east, west and south sides and stakes to
the north. Mr. Troy Maxwell of Pinnacle Environmental met the archaeologists at the
study area and showed them its boundaries.
Survey began in the southeast corner and went west. Sixteen culturally sterile shovel tests
ranging from 31 to 36 cm bs were excavated into clay. No cultural materials older than
50 years were found on the ground surface.
Conclusions
No cultural materials older than 50 years were found on the ground surface or buried in
16 shovel tests. The lack of historic sites is attributed to the preference for using the land
for farming. The absence of prehistoric sites probably is a result of several contributing
factors. The low biotic diversity, intermittent water supply and lack of knappable lithic
resources did not make the study area a favorable area to camp such as further east along
Mountain Creek and its spring fed tributaries where perennial water was present.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are
present within the proposed high school development tract. No evidence of prehistoric or
historic occupation was found. AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural
resource investigations are unwarranted due to the absence of archaeological sites and
that the Mansfield School District be allowed to construct the school and related activity
areas. We further recommend that construction supervisors be advised that should buried
archaeological materials be uncovered during construction, work should immediately
cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission
should be advised of the discovery. Work should not continue until discussions with the
Texas Historical Commission have been completed.
