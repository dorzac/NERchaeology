MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 8 February 2011, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the 18.95-acre Aspen Heights Tract located in San
Marcos, Hays County, Texas (Project Area). The area of potential effect (APE) consists of the
entire 18.95-acre property. The Project Area is located on private property, and its future
development into a residential community will be privately funded. However, because the
Project Area lies within the San Marcos city limits, its development is regulated by the San
Marcos City Code and the San Marcos Horizons Master Plan. As such, the undertaking also
falls under the jurisdiction of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. On behalf of Aspen Heights, Horizon conducted the intensive cultural resources
survey of the 18.95-acre Project Area in compliance with the regulations of Section 106 of the
NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were located
within the Project Area, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new historic site. Site
41HY481 was recorded as a mid-20th century farmstead that is considered to be ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP under Criteria A, B, C, and D. Based on the survey results, and the
assessment that site 41HY481 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the development of the Project Area will have no impact on significant cultural resources and
that no further investigations are warranted on the property. Horizon therefore recommends that
cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 18.95-Acre Aspen Heights Tract in San Marcos, Hays
County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the 18.95acre Aspen Heights Tract located in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1
and 2). Aspen Heights is proposing to develop the tract into a small residential community, and
the area of potential effect (APE) of the development consists of the entire 18.95-acre tract.
The Project Area is located on private property and its future development will be privately
funded. However, because the Project Area lies within the San Marcos city limits, its
development is regulated by the San Marcos City Code and the San Marcos Horizons Master
Plan. As such, the undertaking also falls under the jurisdiction of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. On behalf of Aspen Heights, Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the intensive cultural resources survey of the
18.95-acre Project Area in compliance with the regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were located within the Project
Area, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal Investigator for the
project, while Michael Mudd conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 8 February 2011. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts. The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres on
projects between 11 and 100 acres in size. As such, a total of 10 shovel tests were necessary
within the 18.95-acre Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded
these minimum survey standards by conducting a total of 16 shovel tests across the Project
Area.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new historic site. Site
41HY481 was recorded as a mid-20th century farmstead that is considered to be ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP under Criteria A, B, C, and D. Based on the survey results, and the
assessment that site 41HY481 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the development of the Project Area will have no impact on significant cultural resources and
that no further investigations are warranted on the property. Horizon therefore recommends that
cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.
This report presents the results of this cultural resource survey. Following this
introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the environmental and cultural background,
respectively, of the Project Area. Chapter 4.0 describes the results of archival research, and
Chapter 5.0 presents the methods implemented during the survey. Finally, Chapter 6.0
presents the results of the cultural resources survey and the management recommendations for
the project. Chapter 7.0 lists the references cited in the report, and Appendix A summarizes
shovel test data.

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area consists of an 18.95-acre tract located on the northeastern edge of the
city of San Marcos, Texas (see Figures 1 and 2). It can be found on the US Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5’ San Marcos North, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). At the time of
the survey, the vast majority of the Project Area consisted of undeveloped range/pastureland
surrounded by encroaching development. A total of 4 structures are present on a small knoll in
the northwestern extent of the property. These consist of 1 partially burned brick house, 1
modern abandoned residence, 1 small wooden shed, and 1 workshop. In and around the knoll
are dense stands of mature live oak and cedar trees. Several modern mobile homes are
present near the northwestern Project Area boundary, and considerable amounts of modern
trash are present in their vicinity. The southeastern portion of the Project Area is dominated by
dense stands of cedar trees with occasional open areas containing dense clump grasses. In
general, the topography of the Project Area slopes gradually from the knoll landform to the
northern extent southeast toward the southernmost boundary.
Photographs of the Project
Area at the time of the survey are presented in Figures 3 through 6.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area consists of predominantly flat pastureland with a small knoll rising in
the northwestern portion of the property. Elevations across the Project Area range between
approximately 610.0 and 640.0 feet (185.9 to 195.1 meters [m]) above mean sea level, with the
elevation changes limited predominantly to the aforementioned knoll on the property.
Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Guadalupe River basin. The property
drains to the southeast by overland sheet flow into the Blanco River, which is located
approximately 2000.0 feet (609.6 m) to the southeast.
The Blanco River flows generally
southeastward to its confluence with the San Marcos River, which in turn flows generally
southeastward to discharge into the Guadalupe River. The Guadalupe River eventually
discharges into the Gulf of Mexico at San Antonio Bay, which is situated southeast of Victoria
between Calhoun and Refugio counties.

2.3

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The Project Area is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age, sedimentary rock
strata; specifically, the Project Area is underlain by Late Pleistocene Fluviatile terrace deposits
(Qt), which consist of gravel sand, silt, and clay (Barnes 1981). Specifically, the Project Area is

situated on the Lewisville-Gruene-Krum soil association (Batte 1984). The Lewisville-GrueneKrum Association is composed of shallow to deep, gently sloping soils over loamy, clayey and
gravelly sediments on stream terraces and valley fills in the Blackland Prairie and Edwards
Plateau physiographic regions. The parent material of in situ soils in the vicinity of the Project
Area is the indurated limestone bedrock that underlies the region. Closer to the major rivers,
soils formed over alluvium of recent and Pleistocene age, but no substantial alluvial deposits are
present in the vicinity of the Project Area.
A total of 3 soil types are mapped within the boundaries of the Project Area.
soils are described in Table 1 (NRCS 2011):

While aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep alluvial
sediments adjacent to major streams in Central Texas, the relative antiquity of the preHolocene-age terraces in the Project Area suggests that any cultural resources would be
constrained to the modern ground surface, rather than in buried contexts, in erosional settings
lacking integrity. Intact, buried archeological deposits may occur within alluvial sediments near
major streams, though no deep Holocene-age alluvial sediments are mapped within the current
Project Area. The terrain within the Project Area consists of a Pleistocene-age marly clay
terrace situated above the more recent Holocene-age terraces of the Blanco River. Erosion has
been relatively extensive within the Project Area, and very little Holocene-age sediment remains
on the surface of the terrace structure. No deep alluvial sediments with the potential to contain
buried, intact archeological deposits are mapped within the Project Area. Other things being
equal, any cultural resources associated with the soils mapped in the Project Area would be
expected to occur on the modern ground surface in deflated, eroded contexts that would lack
stratigraphic integrity.

2.4

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was

8

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 18.95-Acre Aspen Heights Tract in San Marcos, Hays
County, Texas

more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Hays County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to
subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81 centimeters (cm) (32 inches [in])
and temperature averages 19°Celsius (C) (67°Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36°C
(96°F) in August (the warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During
this time, however, drier periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from
30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 in), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to
50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall.
Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an 18-hour period
in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge that fell in less
than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of
winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for
moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over
meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather
than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region, and
rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943).
Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The
boundary, characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian
provinces passes through western Williamson County, northwest of the Project Area. Rainfall in
the Texan province is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite
(1948) as a C2 (moist subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this
soil type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas
include the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies. Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat
and bog marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana),
hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), blacktailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the
Austroriparian province—eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—
occur in the Texan.
Sixteen species of lizards, including 7 grassland and 9 forest species, are also found,
including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis)
(grassland species), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard
(Sceloporus olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink
(Eumeces obsoletus) (forest species). Only 5 species of urodele fauna are known from this
area, including small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander

10

County, Texas

(Ambystoma tigrinum), and eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts
as a barrier to urodele distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west
and the Austroriparian fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the
Texan into the Austroriparian province include Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s
chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water
snake (Nerodia rhombifer rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early
historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic
hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of
North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly
through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late

HJN 110019 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The

14

110019 - arch survey report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 18.95-Acre Aspen Heights Tract in San Marcos, Hays
County, Texas

first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement
of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished.
During the Spanish period, the region lay at the edge of the main route from San Antonio
to East Texas, the Old San Antonio Road 1 . In 1691, Domingo Terán de los Ríos crossed the
southern edge of the county on his way to the East Texas missions and the Red River. The
Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition explored the upper San Marcos River in 1709, and Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis was attacked by Apaches in 1714 at the San Marcos River crossing. A
mission to be called San Marcos was authorized in 1729 near the site of present San Marcos,
but the authorization was later rescinded in favor of San Antonio. San Xavier Mission and San
Francisco Xavier Presidio were located briefly at the site in 1755-56, but no permanent
settlement was attempted until 1807, when some 80 persons were moved to the Old San
Antonio Road crossing of the San Marcos River. San Marcos de Neve, 1 of a chain of defense
settlements, was abandoned 4 years later, after flooding and attacks by Comanche and
Tonkawa Indians. To encourage settlement after the Mexican War for Independence, the
government of Coahuila and Texas issued land grants in the county to Juan Martín Veramendi
in 1831, Juan Vicente Campos in 1832, and Thomas Jefferson Chambers in 1834. The first
Anglo-American settler in Hays County, Thomas G. McGehee, was issued a league of land in
1835 by the Mexican government and was farming north of the site of present San Marcos in
1846.
On 1 March 1848, the state legislature formed Hays County from territory formerly part
of Travis County. William W. Moon, Eli T. Merriman, and Mike Sessom, original settlers and
members of John Coffee Hays’ company of Texas Rangers, worked with General Edward
Burleson, a member of the Texas Senate, to have the new county named for Hays. County
organization and the designation of San Marcos as the county seat gave impetus to settlement;
the population grew from 387 in 1850 to 2,126 in 1860. The county shrank slightly on
12 February 1858, when it lost acreage to the new Blanco County and gained a portion of
Comal County. On 10 January 1862, the legislature again transferred another small area to
Blanco County. Boundaries remained stable for nearly a century, until resurvey of the HaysTravis county line in 1955 added more than 16,000 acres to Hays County.
A stage line from Austin to San Antonio crossed the county in 1848, the year that
Edward Burleson built the first sawmill. W.A. Thompson built the first cotton gin in the early
1850s, and, between 1855 and 1885, Ezekiel Nance built and operated 5 gins, 5 gristmills, a
sawmill, a shingle mill, and a beef packery. Alfred B.F. Kerr organized the first church in Hays

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

County in 1847, and a school was built at San Marcos in 1849. Another school was opened at
Snake Lake in 1851, and John D. Pitts built a school in Stringtown before 1860. The Johnson
Institute, founded in 1852 by Thomas Jefferson Johnson, drew students from a large area of
Central Texas until it closed in 1872.
The early settlers of Hays County were a mix of old Texans and Georgia and Arkansas
immigrants. With the coming of the Civil War, most of the residents favored secession. Colonel
Peter C. Woods’ 36th Texas Cavalry regiment was organized at Camp Clark, in neighboring
Guadalupe County, in 1862; Company A was primarily made up of Hays County men. During
the war, county beef helped to feed Confederate forces. Shortly after the war’s end, Colonel
George F. Snyder, a Georgian, established the first newspaper in Hays County, the Pioneer.
During Reconstruction, a Ku Klux Klan group was formed, and, in May 1876, a military
organization, the San Marcos Greys, was formed.
George Neill drove the first herd of cattle from Hays County to Kansas in 1867, and
other drives followed. Farming also became more profitable in the eastern part of the county
and helped encourage a fresh influx of settlers. By 1878, the county was out of debt, several
new communities had been organized, and schools had grown in number to match the
increased population. The Coronal Institute was founded in 1866 followed by the San Marcos
public school system in 1870. Southwest Texas Normal School was authorized at the turn of
the century and opened in 1903 as a teacher-training institution; it became Southwest Texas
State University in 1969. San Marcos Baptist Academy was established in 1907.
In 1880, the first Hays County rail line, built by the International-Great Northern Railroad,
was completed to San Marcos from Austin; it later extended to San Antonio. Another population
boom followed the railroad. The county population nearly doubled, from 7,555 in 1880 to
14,142 in 1900, and then remained virtually unchanged for the next 50 years despite the
influences of World War I and the depression of the 1930s. Even the economic stimulus of
World War II had only momentary effect. Hays County remained predominantly agricultural;
almost 90% of the mid-1960s farm income came from livestock. Not until the establishment of
the Gary Job Corps Training Center on the site of the former Gary Air Force Base in 1964 and
the growth of enrollment at the university in San Marcos did Hays County begin a period of
steady growth—from 19,934 in 1960 to 27,642 in 1970; 40,594 in 1980; and 65,614 in 1990.
Although agriculture remained significant in county economics, nonagricultural income, primarily
at the educational and training facilities, played an even larger role. The 1979 per capita
income of $6,009, however, remained well below the state average of $8,778.
Since early in the century, Hays County has enjoyed a steady influx of tourists attracted
by the caves, springs, and spas of Wimberley and San Marcos. Aquarena Springs and Wonder
Caves are particularly well known. Camp Ben McCulloch, near Driftwood, was organized in
1896 as a site for reunions of the United Confederate Veterans; their descendents continue the
annual tradition. More recently, the county caught the attention of environmentalists. Ezell
Cave, a watery cavern in San Marcos, is the habitat of several rare animal species, including
the Texas blind salamander, and 6 of the 10 known varieties of aquatic cave fauna are found
only in this cave and its underground waters. The only known habitat of the San Marcos
salamander is San Marcos Springs, and 2 other unique fish of the springs, the fountain darter

and San Marcos gambusia, were classed as endangered in 1990. Also on the endangered list
is Texas wild rice, which is not known to exist outside a small area near the springs.
During the 1970s and 1980s, growth in the northern and eastern parts of the county was
influenced by the expanding Austin metropolitan area and the Austin-San Antonio urban strip
along Interstate Highway 35. In 1973, Hays County became part of the Austin Metropolitan
Statistical Area. In addition to the county seat, San Marcos, which had a population of 28,743 in
1990, other county population centers are Wimberley (2,403), Kyle (2,225), Buda (1,795),
Dripping Springs (1,033), and Hays (252).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

In order to determine if any previously recorded archeological sites, historic structures,
or cemeteries were documented within the Project Area, Horizon conducted archival research
via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas web site (THC 2011) and via the
National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer (NPS 2011). This review
indicated the presence of 17 previously recorded archeological sites, 2 cemeteries, and 2
properties listed on the NRHP within a 1.0-mile (1.2-kilometer [km]) perimeter of the Project
Area (Table 2; Figure 7). No previously recorded archeological sites, cemeteries, or historic
properties, including any listed on the NRHP or formally designated as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs), are located within the boundaries the Project Area. However, site 41HY475
is a historic homestead located just southwest of the Project Area boundaries. Based on the
Atlas, no formal cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
In addition to reviewing the THC’s Atlas database and the NPS’s NRHP Google Earth
map layer, Horizon also accessed the Perry-Castañeda Library online map collection to review
historic topographic quadrangles and aerial photographs containing the Project Area. The
reviewed files include topographic quadrangles dated 1911, 1964, and 1973, and aerial
photographs dated 1953, 1965, 1973, and 1986 (Figures 8 through 14).
As can be seen in the 1911 topographic quadrangle, no structures are present within the
Project Area by 1911 (see Figure 8). However, by 1953, the aerial photography reflects some
obvious clearing on the knoll in the northwestern portion of the Project Area and a blur on the
image within this clearing that likely represents the house that is currently located on the knoll
(see Figure 11). This house structure is visible on all subsequent aerial photographs and
topographic quadrangles containing the Project Area. Based on these sources, the house
structure appears to have been constructed on the property at some point between 1911 and
1953. Aside from this house structure, no other structures are visible within the boundaries of
the Project Area until 1994 (see Figure 1). These structures, visible in the extreme
northwestern portion of the Project Area on Figure 1, are modern structures with no historic
significance.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the Project Area on
8 February 2011. This entailed both intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing
efforts. The TSMASS require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres on projects between 11
and 100 acres in size. As such, a total of 10 shovel tests were necessary within the 18.95-acre
Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded these minimum survey
standards by conducting 16 shovel tests within the Project Area.
A selective-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. If any nondiagnostic cultural materials (e.g., shell, lithic debitage, etc.) were observed on the surface or
within shovel tests, they were to be tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently
returned to where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points,
charcoal, historic materials with maker’s marks, etc.) were to be collected for analysis and
further documentation. Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms,
shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were
completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on any artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also
completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS
units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. Shovel test locations
are presented in Figure 15. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new historic site. Site
41HY481 was recorded as a mid-20th century homestead located on the knoll in the
northwestern portion of the Project Area. It is described in detail below.
6.1.1

General Site Description

Site 41HY481 was recorded as a small homestead composed of a main brick house on
the southern portion of a small knoll and 3 smaller associated structures to its north (Figures 16
and 17). The 3 associated structures consist of a smaller, wooden house, a cinderblock “shop”
and a small shed. The entire area is littered with domestic debris ranging from older bottles and
ceramics to modern plastic soda bottles, furniture, and appliances. This suggests that the site
was occupied up until recent times. The site itself rests upon a small knoll in the northwestern
portion of the Project Area. Aside from cleared areas around the standing structures, the site is
rather heavily wooded with a variety of tree species including live oak, Ashe juniper, chinaberry,
and hackberry. Being situated atop the knoll, soils on the site are generally shallow, consisting
of shallow loamy clay over marl deposits with no potential to harbor buried, stratified cultural
deposits.
6.1.2

Cultural Features

The cultural features observed on site 41HY481 consist of the main brick house on the
southern portion of the knoll, a smaller wooden house to its northwest, a small shed to its west,
and a cinderblock “shop” to its north. The main house is constructed of reddish-pink brick
around the entire lower exterior and wooden siding over the gabled eaves (Figures 18 and 19).
Generally speaking, the house appears rather modern in nature with modern dimensional
lumber, aluminum window frames, modern electrical boxes/outlets, PVC plumping, and a
composite shingle roof. Based on brick color, a rear addition appears to have been added to
the house subsequent to its initial construction (Figure 20). The structure is in a heavy state of
disrepair due to the fact that it has burned at some point in the past, leaving the central portion
of the roof collapsed (Figure 21). Based on its location on the southern portion of the knoll, this
structure appears to be same structure that originally shows up on the 1953 aerial photograph
and 1964 topographic quadrangle (see Figures 9 and 11).

Chapter 6.0: Results and Recommendations

The second feature on the site is a smaller wooden house also constructed with
relatively modern materials such as dimensional lumber, electrical boxes, plumbing, etc. (Figure
22). This structure is not mapped on the 1964 or 1973 topographic quadrangles, although it is
present on the 1994 topographic quadrangle (see Figures 1, 9, and 10). Its later appearance on
the area maps suggests that it was constructed sometime after 1973.
The other 2 standing structures consist of a small wooden shed constructed from
modern dimensional lumber, plywood, and composite shingles (Figure 23) and a larger shop
building constructed primarily of cinder blocks, but also finished out with a hodge-podge of
building materials such as mismatched dimensional lumber, plywood, and wooden signs (Figure
24). Both of these structures appear to be generally modern in nature.
Although the 2 house features on the site both appear to have modern plumbing, a
probable abandoned well was noted just northeast of the main brick house. This well feature
was evidenced by an opening in the ground covered partially by corrugated metal (Figure 25).
Based on the reviewed topographic quadrangles and aerial photographs, all of the
structures on the site postdate 1911. The main brick house appears to have been constructed
sometime between 1911 and 1953, with a more probable construction date closer to 1953
based on the modern nature of the materials used for its construction. The second house
structure and the other 2 associated outbuildings likely postdate 1973 as none are visible on the
topographic quadrangles or aerial photographs of the area until 1994.
6.1.3

Observed Cultural Materials

The observed cultural materials on site 41HY481 consist entirely of domestic items and
refuse. The materials range from generally modern trash such as plastic soda bottles, milk jugs,
5-gallon buckets, toys, appliances, etc. (Figure 26), to somewhat older domestic items such as
ceramics and glass bottles (Figure 27).
Several specimens were collected for attempted
dating. Of these, a ceramic plate bears a “Made in China” stamp and a brown glass bottle
bears a “Made in Belgium” mark on the base. The Tariff Act of 1930 required all imported
materials to be labeled with their country of origin (Becker 2000). As both of these items contain
the country of origin label, they postdate 1930. Two other recovered specimens consist of
beer/soda bottles with basal perimeter stippling. Such basal stippling denotes a post-1940s
date for these specimens (SHA 2011).
Based on the recovered and observed cultural
materials, the occupation of site 41HY481 appears to postdate 1930.
6.1.4

Horizontal and Vertical Site Extents

Based on the locations of the structures on site 41HY481 as well as the surrounding
extent of the scatter of associated surface debris, the horizontal extent of the site measures
approximately 100.0 m (328.1 feet) north/south by 75.0 m (246.1 feet) east/west.
Soils on the site are generally shallow, with subsurface marl present at roughly 20.0
centimeters (cm) (7.9 inches) below surface. While most of the debris consists of surface
scatter, debris specimens were recovered from depths of 20.0 cm (7.9 inches), indicating a
vertical range for the deposits of 0 to 20.0 cm (7.9 inches).

6.1.5

Deed Research

Chain-of-title information on the Project Area is available going back to as early as 1937;
however, information about earlier owners could not be located (Appendix B). The overall
18.95-acre Project Area is composed of pieces of several other larger parcels that traded hands
throughout the 20th century. The chains-of-title for these parcels reveal that J.R. Wilhelm sold
the majority of the properties to C.C. McNeill in 1937. McNeill sold these parcels in 1944 to L.A.
Fritz, who then resold some parcels back to McNeil and other parcels to L.B. McClanahan that
same year.
McClanahan held on to the property until 1967, but McNeil sold his parcels to
Eston Rogers in 1946. Rogers retained ownership until 1964.
While it is unclear who owned/developed the property containing site 41HY481 due to all
the various parcels contained within the overall chain-of-title, it can be narrowed down to both
L.B. McClanahan and Eston Rogers. This assessment is based on the following: 1) the
topographic maps and aerial photographs do not show structures on the property until 1953: 2)
the observed cultural materials indicate a post-1930 occupation of the site; 3) the relatively
modern nature of the structures on the site suggest an even later construction date closer to the
1950s when the house first shows up on aerial photographs; and 4) McClanahan and Rogers
both owned parcels comprising the Project Area between 1944/1946 and 1964/1967. Archival
research has uncovered no connections between these 2 probable owners and people of
significance in the history of San Marcos or Hays County.
6.1.6

Summary

Site 41HY481 consists of a relatively generic historic farmstead occupied from roughly
the mid-20th century until rather recently. The main house appears first on a 1953 aerial
photograph of the area and all observed cultural materials around the structure postdate the
1930s and 1940s, supporting the mid-20th century assessment. None of the surrounding
structures appear on reviewed maps until 1994, suggesting that they all postdate 1973 (the date
on the topographic quadrangle where the main house is last seen without associated
structures).
The main brick house is severely dilapidated due to the fact that the roof has
burned and collapsed into the surrounding brick walls. Based on its dilapidated nature, lack of
integrity, and general commonness, the structure does not rise to a level of significance under
NRHP Criterion A. The probable occupants of the site, McClanahan or Rogers, do not appear
to be prominent figures in the history of San Marcos or Hays County, indicating that the site also
lacks significance under NRHP Criteria B and C. Finally, the cultural deposits on the site are
generally shallow, being confined to primarily surface contexts or shallow subsurface contexts
with a maximum depth of 20.0 cm (7.9 inches) due to the presence of near-surface marl
deposits. As a result, the site is also not considered to be significant under NRHP Criterion D.
Overall, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41HY481 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and that
no further investigations are warranted on this site.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the cultural resources survey of the Project Area, including the
assessment that site 41HY481 does not qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under Criteria A, B,

C, or D, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the 18.95-acre Aspen Heights tract will
have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted
at these locations. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted
for the undertaking.
