ABSTRACT
An archaeological evaluation of a proposed 59.44 mile water line in southeast
Cherokee County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates in May
2003 under Texas Antiquities Permit 3126. This project was reviewed by the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division. Federal involvement is through the United
States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development. The background check revealed
four archaeological sites (41CE19, 41CE51, 41CE66, and 41CE73) within or near the
project area right-of-way. A visit to the project area prior to the field survey, identified 15
areas as likely settings for prehistoric sites. However, no previously recorded sites were
found during the field survey. The two areas within the boundaries of previously recorded
sites 41CE19 and 41CE66 are recommended for monitoring.
Otherwise, it is
recommended that the Alto Rural Water Supply Corporation be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned with no further archaeological investigations. Copies of this report
are on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory; Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division; Alto Rural Water Supply Corporation in Alto, Texas; and Brazos
Valley Research Associates in Bryan, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) was retained by Alto Rural Water
Supply Corporation (WSC) through J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc., Consulting Engineers
of Palestine, Texas, to conduct a cultural resources survey of a proposed water line that
will service the residents of rural southeast Cherokee County (Figure 1). The project area
is depicted on six USGS 7.5' topographic maps: Alto (1973; 31095-F1), Atoy (1973; 31095G1), Douglass (1983; 31094-F8), Forest (1973; 31095-E1), Pryor Mountain (1973; 31095F2), and Weches (1973; 31095-E2). The 15 areas investigated during this study are
depicted on the relevant topographic maps as Appendix I.
Improvements to the distribution system will consist of adding approximately
313,835 feet (59.44 miles) of new water line throughout the existing service. The majority
of the line will be installed along state and county roads within existing rights-of-way and on
private property where easements have been obtained. Two segments will traverse crosscountry. Elevations within the service area range from a low of 220 feet to a high of 740
feet. Large trees within paths of pipelines will be avoided where possible by either
rerouting around or boring under to prevent damage to the trees. Creek crossings by the
proposed water lines will be encased and creek bottoms restored to their original condition.

Overall, Cherokee County is located in Northeast Texas in the Eastern Planning
Region, an area known to contain significant archaeological sites. Because of this
archaeological potential, a cultural resource study by professional archaeologists was
warranted according to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The Federal
agency involved in this project is the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural
Development office. Since a portion of the project area is within rights-of-way owned by
the State of Texas, an antiquities permit was required, and Antiquities Permit 3126 was
issued to BVRA by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division. The project
number assigned by BVRA is 03-13. The field survey was conducted on May 26-27, 2003
by Edward P. Baxter. William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Cherokee County is located in Northeast Texas within the Eastern Planning Region
as defined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993). The following comments are taken from their
comprehensive document for this area, and the interested reader is referred to this volume
for more detailed information. As of 1993, Cherokee County had less than .037 recorded
sites per kilometer, ranking it last in the area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.1.2).
The county is described as rural with 0.15 - 0.29 people per square kilometer (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.2.3) and a population growth of less than 5% (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993:Figure 1.2.4). Environmentally, it is situated within the Piney Woods, Mixed
Pine-Hardwood Forest area of East Texas. Artificial disturbance in the county consists
mainly of lignite mines from the Deep Basin Wilcox formation and reservoirs such as Lake
Fork Reservoir. In 1991, the county had a total of 134 recorded archaeological sites, of
which 14 were regarded as significant (kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.1.1). At the
time of this survey, 352 sites were known to exist in the county (TARL site files).
One of the major problems regarding our understanding of the archaeology of
Northeast Texas lies in the lack of data for sites with isolable Paleoindian or Archaic
components. "Despite the existence of a potentially rich data base, the body of useful
information on these time periods is small" (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:70). The authors
credit this to the fact that most early materials have been found mixed with later
components. When found, they are difficult to interpret because of limited absolute dating;
poorly defined artifact chronologies; limited preservation of economic data such as faunal
and botanical remains, and the typically low density nature of the cultural remains. No sites
with isolable Paleoindian or Archaic components have been reported for Cherokee County
as recently as 1993 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.3.1). One site (41CE261)
attributed to the Hunter-Gatherer period (prior to sedentism) has been identified in
Cherokee County (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.3.2). Site 41CE261 is listed as a
possible Archaic site containing faunal remains and a probable midden. One of the
problems with these early sites is that they usually contain only lithic artifacts; rarely, some
sites have yielded hardwood nutshells and burned rock concentrations. "The scarcity of
remains other than lithic artifacts is due mostly to the relatively great age of these deposits
and the poor preservation of organic remains and nondurable features" (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993:75). The minimum criterion for significance of these sites is the presence of
non-artifactual data such as cultural features and faunal and botanical remains and
diagnostic projectile points that allow confident chronological assessments.

3

Following the hunter gatherer period (circa 500 B.C.), the emergence of sedentism
arrived in Northeast Texas and lasted until A.D. 1000. Sedentism is defined by Kenmotsu
and Perttula (1993:97) as "cultural systems where all or part of the population resides at
the same location for all or most of the year." Until recently, very little research had been
directed toward the emergence of sedentism in Northeast Texas. Factors that are believed
to have been causal in terms of this change include population growth, territorial
constriction, environmental change, technological innovation, modifications in social
organization, and/or changes in subsistence strategies (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:97).
During this time a major technological innovation, the emergence of pottery and the
bow and arrow, appeared. Sites dating to this period are often referred to as Early
Ceramic. The George C. Davis site (41CE19) is one of the major sites of this period in
Cherokee County to be excavated.
The next period is referred to as the development of agriculture in Northeast Texas
before A.D. 1600. Study questions for this period should focus on the processes that
influenced the development of agriculture in Northeast Texas among prehistoric Caddoan
populations with agriculture defined here as a maize-based economy as described in Fritz
(1990). Major sites of this period include Caddoan archaeological sites, particularly
habitation locales with associated burials and burial furniture (usually pottery). More than
4700 prehistoric archaeological sites have been recorded in both the Northeast Texas
region and adjoining counties where associations exist with the Caddoan archaeological
tradition (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:124).
Approximately 80% of the significant sites in this region are prehistoric Caddoan
sites which were occupied sometime between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1600. These sites
include multiple and single mound centers; cemeteries; habitation sites such as villages,
hamlets, and farmsteads; and possible extractive/processing locations. Most of these
sites, unfortunately, are on private land and are not protected from vandalism. Between 5
and 9 important Formative-Middle Caddoan sites were known to exist in Cherokee County
as of 1993 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.1). The number of important Late
Caddoan Period sites as of 1993 for Cherokee County is, however, greater at 30
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.2). In 1993, 39 Caddoan Period archaeological
sites with excellent faunal and floral preservation were known to exist. Although only five
are in Cherokee County (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.3), no county in
Northeast Texas had a higher number at that time.
Cemeteries and burial mounds are
common throughout Northeast Texas, and these archeological phenomena are viewed as
extremely significant research data sets because of the bioarchaeological, cultural, and
sociopolitical information relevant to the development of agriculture encoded in the
mortuary practices, associated grave goods, and pathologies/infections preserved in the
skeletal remains (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:127).
4

In 1993, 21 archaeological sites in Cherokee County had produced human remains
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.5); two single mound sites and one multiple
mound site are recorded in the county (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.6).
Fifty-three Critical Resource Zones have been defined in the Northeast Texas
region for sites that are relevant to the research on the development of agriculture prior to
A.D. 1600. Five of these zones are in Cherokee County (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:Figure 2.5.7). One of these zones is in the southeast portion of the county not far
from the current project area.
The final archaeological period is that of European contact with native Indian
groups, especially the historic Caddo (circa A.D. 1685 - A.D. 1859). The infusion of
material goods and cultural traits brought to the area by the Europeans changed forever
the lifeways of the native Caddoan peoples. At least 89-90 Caddoan sites of this period
are known in Northeast Texas. In Cherokee County, six sites have produced historic
materials in association with native Indian artifacts (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:152).
These include brass bells and European gunflints (41CE6), glass beads and brass tinkler
(41CE12), majolica pottery (41CE19), glass beads (41CE20), 18th century gun found on
the surface (41CE48), and glass beads (41CE293). Two Critical Resource Zones have
been identified for Historic Contact Period sites in Cherokee County. These are Killough
Creek and Bowles Creek (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.6.2). The major historic
Indian groups in Cherokee County in the early 18th Century were probably the Hasinai
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.6.6).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Numerous large-scale reservoir surveys have been conducted in Northeast Texas.
Our knowledge of the prehistory of this area is based largely on the results of these
surveys and subsequent testing and excavation of sites found within their boundaries.
Reservoir studies which involve portions of Cherokee County are Lake Palestine
(Anderson 1971; Anderson et al. 1974) to the northwest of the project area (Figure 1).
Several archaeological investigations have recorded sites in or near the project
area. Of interest to this project are sites 41CE19, 41CE51, 41CE66, and 41CE73. They
are discussed below.
The George C. Davis site (41CE19), the southernmost Caddoan mound site in
Texas, is the largest and most significant site in the county. It was first examined by the
landowner using prison labor in 1904 (Shafer 1973:10). In 1939-1941, The University of
Texas, Works Progress Administration carried out the first controlled excavations at the
site. The first detailed analysis of the site was performed by University of Texas
archaeologist Alex D. Krieger (Newell and Krieger 1949). Later work was performed under
the direction of Dee Ann Story in 1968, 1969, and 1970 (Story 1972); Darrell Creel (1978);
Dee Ann Story in 1979 and 1980 (Story 1981), and Davis et al. in 1987 (1992). It is located
in Area 17.
In 1969, George B. Kegley and Daniel C. Witter recorded sites 41CE51 and
41CE66 while conducting an archaeological survey for the State Building Commission
(Kegley 1969). This survey was conducted along the middle course of the Neches River in
order to collect comparative data for the George C. Davis site (41CE19). Very little
information is available for these sites. The following discussions are taken from the report
by Kegley.
Site 41CE51 is referred to as an artificial earthen mound or a resistent old island
remnant on the floodplain of Larrison Creek. The original shape and size is difficult to
estimate since the mound has been truncated by a bulldozer. Little artifactual material is
present on the surface but (some) may be buried under the alluvium. The investigators
observed 2 potsherds, 2 utilized flakes, 1 grinding implement, and 1 "problematical" artifact.
It is in Area 4

6

Site 41CE66 is a prehistoric site on a rise on the flood plain of Bowles Creek 0.4
miles west of Mound B at the George C. Davis site. Test pits (number not specified)
yielded two pieces of pottery and lithic debris at a depth of one meter below the surface.
The route of the proposed water line passes very close to this site. This site is located on
both sides of County Road 2907 (Weeping Mary Road) on a terrace overlooking Bowles
Creek to the east. It is in Area 16.
These sites were in the path of a water line route investigated by James E. Corbin
(1987) during a survey for the Alto Rural WSC in 1987. Corbin did not conduct any work at
these sites because they were considered "sensitive" by the Texas Historical Commission
who recommended monitoring during construction.
Site 41CE73 is a historic site that dates to the early 19th century Mexican Land
Grant homestead. In 1979, during the University of Texas field school, a two story log
cabin known as the Berryman Cabin, a small log spring house, and out buildings were still
standing. Behind the cabin is a family cemetery where members of the Berryman family
are buried. According to the site form this site should be placed on the National Register of
Historic Places. No report documenting the work of the 1979 field school was found at
TARL. It is outside the construction corridor and, therefore, not in one of the areas
surveyed.
At the time of this survey, archaeologists from The University of Texas at Austin
were conducting a magnetometer survey at the George C. Davis site (41CE19). Although
they did not work in the area where the proposed water line will pass through the site at
Area 17, they were in the immediate area.

7

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check for previously recorded sites in or near
the project area was conducted by Jean Hughes at TARL, the state repository for site
records. Archaeological sites found to be within or near the construction corridor were
plotted on project maps for use in the field (Appendix II). In addition, relevant reports were
checked in order to become familiar with the kinds of sites known to occur in the area.
Prior to conducting the field survey, the Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist
drove the entire line (59.44 miles) in order to identify high probability areas for the presence
of significant archaeological sites. As a result of this endeavor, 23 areas were plotted on
the project area maps as high probability areas if the water line is to be placed on private
property in undisturbed soil. According to the engineering firm, J. F. Fontaine &
Associates, Inc., the water line will be placed in the disturbed county right-of-way in 6 of
these areas. Based on this information, BVRA eliminated these areas from survey. Thee
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division concurred with this decision, and 15
areas were selected for survey. The 23 original areas were renumbered for this project as
areas 1-15. Two areas where the water line will pass through known sites (41CE19 and
41CE66) were selected for monitoring (areas 16 and 17).
During the initial
reconnaissance, the investigators looked for historic cemeteries close to the project area,
and not one was found.
The 15 high probability areas were examined through shovel testing. All excavated
dirt was screened using 1/4" hardware cloth, and a shovel test log (Appendix II) was kept.
The approximate location of each test appears on the topographic maps as Appendix IV.
In all, 61 shovel tests were excavated. Each of the 15 areas examined had good exposed
profiles in the ditch within the right-of-way. These areas were visually inspected for cultural
materials. The Project Archaeologist documented the field survey with a digital camera,
and GPS plottings were taken of shovel test locations for more accurate recording on the
topographic maps.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
A check of site records at TARL revealed numerous sites in the general area. Four
sites are in or near the project area. They are 41CE19, 41CE51, 41CE66, and 41CE73
(see Previous Investigations above).
The proposed water line will be placed within the boundaries of sites 41CE19 and
41CE66. These areas were recommended for monitoring; therefore, no shovel testing was
conducted in these locations.
Site 41CE51 is a prehistoric site located on the east side of County Road 2707.
The water line will be placed on the west side of this road. Shovel testing in this area did
not produce evidence of this site.
Site 41CE73 is a historic site located on the north side of County Road 2525.
Although the water line will be placed on this side of the road, the standing structures and
cemetery are well outside the construction corridor. The site was observed during the
initial reconnaissance, and no features were observed within the proposed right-of-way.
No cultural materials (prehistoric or historic) were found in any of the 15 areas
shovel tested by the Project Archaeologist. Although deep sandy soil was present in a few
locations, the sandy mantle overlying sterile clay was not deep at most of the areas shovel
tested. The photograph on the cover of this report illustrates the shallow sandy mantle
overlying sterile clay in Area 2.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No previously unrecorded archaeological sites were found within the project area.
Two previously recorded sites (41CE19 and 41CE66), however, are located within the
construction corridor as currently planned. Site 41CE19 is the very significant George C.
Davis site, and site 41CE66 is an unknown site in close proximity to 41CE19. It is
recommended that monitoring be conducted at these sites (areas 16 and 17) during the
construction of the proposed water line. It is also recommended that the results of the
magnetometer survey conducted by The University of Texas at Austin in the vicinity of the
water line route where it passes through 41CE19 be examined to determine the potential
for buried features in this area prior to monitoring.
No additional work is recommended for the rest of the project area. It is always
possible that areas containing cultural resources are missed during any archaeological
survey. Should any evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during construction
of the proposed water line, work in that area should be halted until the situation can be
evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission in consultation with BVRA and Alto Rural
WSC.
