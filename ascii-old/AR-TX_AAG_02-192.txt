ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey was undertaken in August 2014 by American Archaeology
Group LLC (AAG) for the City of Lubbock for the proposed Northwest Water Reclamation
Plant (45 acres) and a one mile water line in the City of Lubbock, Lubbock County, Texas.
Fieldwork was conducted under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 6998 and
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The pedestrian survey
provided complete coverage of the project area. Subsurface testing was accomplished by
means of 40 backhoe trenches to intensively test for subsurface cultural deposits. No
evidence of any cultural deposits was located. One previous survey covered some of the
same area for the proposed roadways and utilities that run through the current project area
but testing was only completed to less than one meter in depth. The area along the proposed
water line has numerous utilities that restricted access. AAG tested down to caliche or
substrate soil horizons in order to test the deep deposits due to the proposed deep impacts by
the plant construction and water lines. Based on the negative results of the survey, AAG
recommends that construction of the proposed Northwest Water Reclamation Plant and a 1.7
mile waterline be allowed to proceed as planned and no archaeological monitoring is
considered necessary during construction. No artifacts were recovered, therefore, no curation
was arranged.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Lubbock plans to construct the Northwest Water Reclamation Plant and
Waterline in the northwest area of Lubbock, Texas. The project area covers approximately 45
acres for the plant site on the north side of Highway 84 (Clovis Highway), north of the railroad
tracks that borders the southwest corner and bounded by north County Road 1900 on the east
side and on the south side of Yellow House Canyon with a one mile waterline that flows south
across Highway 84 along a new road system in the City of Lubbock, Lubbock County, Texas
(Figure 1). Construction impacts are not expected to exceed 3.5 meters in depth. In fact, fill
material will be brought in to build up the proposed pad site and the majority of the property
will have surface based features.
Because the construction will impact public land, permitting approval is subject to state
regulations governing the protection of cultural resources. Specifically, the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT) mandates that ground-disturbing activities must be preceded or accompanied by
archaeological investigations conducted by qualified professional archaeologists. Regulations
of the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), the state agency which
administers the ACT, are also applicable to development of the property.
American Archaeology Group LLC was retained by Enprotec/Hibbs and Todd, Inc. on
behalf of the City of Lubbock to conduct an archaeological survey. The investigation was
carried out under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit 6998 and was funded by the City of
Lubbock through its contract for engineering services with Alan Plummer and Associates Inc.
and Enprotec/Hibbs and Todd, Inc. Fieldwork was conducted in August 2014 and included
surface survey and backhoe trenching to test for potential subsurface cultural deposits. Relief
within the project area varies 11 feet from 3,245-3,256 feet above mean sea level. UTM
coordinates for the approximate center of the project area are zone 14S 228557 Easting, and
3725938 Northing located on the Lubbock West and Shallowater 7.5â USGS Quad Maps.
This report provides archaeological and historical information relevant to the project
and describes the implementation and results of the field investigations. Based on the results of
the investigation, it is recommended that construction of the proposed Northwest Water
Reclamation Plant and water line be allowed to proceed.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Regional Environment
Geography and Geomorphology
The project area lies within a region known as the Southern High Plains, or Llano
Estacado. An extensive, high plateau, the Llano Estacado covers approximately 82,880
square kilometers (32,000 square miles) in the western Texas Panhandle and eastern New
Mexico. It is bounded by escarpments from 50 to 200 meters high on the east, north, and
west. The southern portion grades into the Edwards Plateau (Holliday 1997; Leatherwood
2006).
The formation of the Llano Estacado is tied to a late Cenozoic uplift of the Rocky
Mountains. Beginning nearly eleven million years ago in the Miocene and continuing in the
Pliocene, vast quantities of alluvial and eolian sediments eroded from the mountains spilled
into eastern New Mexico and Texas, creating the Ogallala Formation. Much of Ogallala is
covered by a crust of indurated caliche, known as the Caprock, formed by the evaporation of
calcium carbonate carried in solution from the mountains (Holliday 1997; Leatherwood
2006; Pazzaglia and Hawley 2004).
Mantling large areas of the Ogallala is another Pliocene deposit, the Blanco
Formation. This formation comprises sequences of lacustrine deposits from lakes formed in
subsidence and deflation basins on the Ogallala surface. Around the beginning of the
Pleistocene (~ 1.6 million years ago), the lakes vanished and the Llano was blanketed by
eolian sands from the Pecos River valley. These sediments constitute the Blackwater Draw
Formation, the major surficial deposit of the Llano (Holliday 1997; Pazzaglia and Hawley
2004).
Basin-like depressions known as playas, dunes, and dry valleys provide slight
topographic relief on the vast plains of the Llano. These features contain most of the intact
assemblages of buried cultural remains in the region and are therefore the focus of most
archaeological research (Holliday 1997). Playas are found throughout the Llano and number
around 25,000. They are typically less than 370 acres (1.5 square kilometers) and average
about 17 acres (0.07 square kilometers). Recent investigations suggest that playas are
erosional features and that most formed during the Pleistocene (Holliday et al. 1996; Bolen
2006). In the past the playas contained water and were both a refuge for wildlife and focus
of prehistoric settlement. Today, they are largely dry. Some contain water from seasonal
rains, but it is generally brackish (Bolen 2006). Dunes, also known as lunettes, are eolian
features found adjacent to playas. Their growth is linked to water levels in the playas, with
growth peaking when low water levels expose lake sediments, the source of the dune
deposits (Frederick 1998). The dry valleys, or draws, of the Llano were once tributaries of
the Red, Brazos and Colorado rivers, and they tend to follow the southeasterly course of
these waterways. The draws cut into the Blackwater Draw Formation and contain
Pleistocene and Holocene lacustrine, paludal, alluvial and eolian deposits (Holliday 1997).

3

Climate
The present day climate of the Llano Estacado is semi-arid, with long, hot summers
and dry winters. Gradients in precipitation and temperature are relatively uniform across the
region; temperature grades higher from northwest to southeast, and precipitation generally
increases from west to east, averaging 22-23 inches (56-58 centimeters) annually in the east
to 14-15 inches (36-38 centimeters) in the west (Holliday 1997; Leatherwood 2006).
Vegetation
Though today the Llano Estacado is largely under cultivation, potential vegetation is
mixed-prairie grassland, dominated by the short-grasses blue grama (Poa arachnifera) and
buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides). Other native plants include yucca cactus, catclaw and
wildflowers (daisies, buttercups, verbena, and Indian paintbrush). Native trees â
cottonwoods and hackberries â are limited to escarpments and canyons. Mesquite, cedars,
Chinese elms, oaks and pines were introduced historically. The natural vegetation of the
Llano remained relatively stable throughout the Holocene. In the late Pleistocene, when
human groups began settling on the Llano, vegetation varied with changing climatic
regimes, ranging from subhumid to semiarid savanna to semiarid grassland (Graves 2006;
Holliday 1997; Samson et al. 1998).
Local Environment
Lubbock County is located on the eastern edge of the Llano Estacado, roughly
midway between its northern and southern boundaries. The county covers an area of 893
square miles (2,313 square kilometers) and comprises primarily flatlands which slope gently
to the southeast from a maximum elevation of 3,400 feet (1,040 meters). As is the case
throughout the Llano Estacado, the flatlands are dotted by playas. Nearly a thousand are
present in Lubbock County. In the southeast corner of county, the North Fork of the Double
Mountain Fork of the Brazos River descends the Caprock Escarpment, the eastern boundary
of the Llano, leveling out at an elevation of about 2,900 feet (884 meters) (Graves 2006). A
tributary of the North Fork, Yellow House Draw, passes just north of the project area.
Geology and Soils
The primary surface deposit in Lubbock County is the early Pleistocene Blackwater
Draw Formation (Fisher 1974). In the study area the Blackwater Draw Formation rests
unconformably on the Pliocene/Miocene Ogallala Formation. The Blackwater Draw
Formation is a massively bedded, grayish red, calcareous, silty, sand with caliche nodules.
The Ogallala Formation is a fluvatile sand, silt, clay, and gravel capped by a hard, pisolitic,
caliche or calcrete (Barnes 1970).
The Web Soil Survey 1.1 (National Cooperative Soil Survey) depicts two soil series
in the project area: Acuff loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, and Estacado clay loam, 1 to 3 percent
slopes (NRCS-USDA 2014). Acuff loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes was formed on plains from
loamy eolian deposits. Typical profiles of this soil series are 0-12 inches loam; 12-80 inches
are below sandy clay loam. Estacado clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes were formed on plains
from calcareous loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw formation of Pleistocene
age.

Both soil series in the study area have been disturbed by farming, road construction,
utility installation; therefore, the likelihood of intact assemblages of artifacts on the surface
or near the surface at the study site is very low.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Cultural Sequence
The history of human settlement on the Llano Estacado and across the greater Texas
area spans over 11,000 years. A chronological framework developed by archaeologists for
the interpretation of Texas history comprises five general temporal periods whose
boundaries correspond to significant cultural and social developments in the region (Nunley
1989:37-46). These periods and their approximate dates are as follows: 1) Paleoindian
(11,500- 8500 before present [hereafter B.P.]); 2) Archaic (8500-2000 B.P.); 3) Late
Prehistoric (1200 B.P. to A.D. 1450); 4) Protohistoric (A.D. 1450-1650); and 5) Historic
(A.D. 1650-1940s).
The Paleoindian period begins during the last Glacial and continues into the early
Holocene. The earliest confirmed Paleoindian populations in Texas were small, highly
mobile bands of hunters armed with distinctive fluted âClovisâ projectile points who
pursued large, late Pleistocene mammals, most notably mammoths (Surovell 2000; Turner
and Hester 1985; Waguespack and Surovell 2003). Later Paleoindian populations developed
new forms of projectile points and refined their hunting strategies in response to
environmental factors such as the extinction of the mammoth and other mega mammals. Yet
despite these adaptations, they maintained a lifeway more like that of their predecessors than
that of later Archaic populations.
The complete demise of the Pleistocene big-game animals and climate change
accompanying the onset of the Holocene are linked to shifts in stone tool technology,
subsistence pursuits and settlement patterns that define the Archaic period. The PaleoindianArchaic transition, like those between succeeding periods, occurred gradually. As the
Pleistocene mega mammals begin to vanish, indigenous populations focused on smaller
game and increased their reliance on local plant foods. With changes in subsistence came
new and more diverse stone toolkits and an increase in tools made of wood and other
organic materials. Additionally, settlements became more stable, and there is evidence for
progressively sophisticated cultural practices, such as systematic burial of the dead
(Bousman et al. 2002). Although the Archaic hunting and gathering lifeway remained
relatively stable for thousands of years, archaeologists are able to define four subperiods (or
eras) â Early, Middle, Late and Transitional â based on a dated sequence of diagnostic
projectile points (Turner and Hester 1985:47-49)
The Late Prehistoric period is marked in some areas of Texas, including parts of the
Panhandle, by the introduction of domesticated plant foods such as corn and beans.
Technological innovations such as pottery and the bow and arrow were widely adopted
(Nunley 1989:44; Turner and Hester 1985:82).
The Protohistoric period is associated with an incipient European presence in the
region. Protohistoric indigenous populations were the first described in early ethnohistoric
accounts. Often, these accounts reflected only indirect contact. Items of European
manufacture are occasionally found in Protohistoric sites, though in most cases these items
were not acquired directly but through so called down-the-line trading (Nunley 1989:45).
6

The Historic period is characterized by a firm historical record and increasing direct
contact between indigenous and European explorers and settlers. Horses introduced by the
Spanish and European material culture led to profound changes in indigenous cultures.
Eventually, Old World diseases, resettlement and warfare claimed up to 95% of Texas
Indians (Klos 2006). The latter part of the Historic period encompasses the Anglo-European
settlement of Texas.
Local Archeological and Historical Context
Biessart et al. (1985) place Lubbock and Lubbock County within the Southern High
Plains archaeological region, which contains a total of 31 counties. With an abundance of
archaeological sites containing well-preserved cultural, faunal and microbotanical remains,
and one of the highest concentrations of Paleoindian sites in North America, this region
offers excellent opportunities to study patterns of prehistoric settlement and adaptations
through time (Holliday 1997; Wendorf 1961).
Among the archaeological resources in Lubbock County is one of the most
significant sites of Southern High Plains region, the Lubbock Lake National Historic and
State Archeological Landmark (41LU1; also known as the Lubbock Lake Site). Since 1939
numerous investigations at this site, located near the project area in Yellow House Draw,
have revealed deeply stratified deposits of cultural remains representing each of the five
cultural chronological periods presented in the preceding section. The site is best known for
its Paleoindian components. They include Clovis and Folsom complex camps and âkill
sitesâ where Pleistocene mammoths, camels, horses, bison were hunted and butchered
(Johnson 1977; Johnson and Holliday 2006).
Native populations occupied the Lubbock County area continuously from the
Paleoindian period through the early Historic period. Throughout the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods, Indians of the Texas Llano were in constant, frequently hostile,
contact with New Mexican puebloan groups (Kenner 1969; Krieger 1946). When the
renowned conquistador Francisco VÃ¡squez de Coronado arrived in the region during his illfated 1540 expedition, he encountered two groups, the Quecheros and Teyas. The former
were likely Apache. The Teyas may have been Apache or the Tejas recorded
ethnohistorically in later times (Kenner 1969:7-9). Some evidence suggests that Coronado
may have passed through Yellow House Draw at the Lubbock Lake site. The first Spanish
explorer that can be placed with certainty in Lubbock County is Father Juan de Salas, who
descended the Blackwater Draw to Yellow House Canyon in 1629. Later Spanish
expeditions followed the same route and recorded Lubbock Lake on their maps as La Punta
de Agua (Leatherwood 2006).
Around 1700 the Comanches moved into the Southern Plains from the north,
bringing European horses. A highly mobile group, the Comanches soon dominated most of
the Llano Estacado and lands to the Brazos River in the east (Leatherwood 2006). In the
1800s they became known as âgun runnersâ for their trade with Mexican Comancheros to
the south and west. While firearms were bartered by both sides, more common was the
exchange of Comanche horses and mules for the iron lances and tomahawks, whiskey,
coffee and tobacco of the Comancheros (Griggs 1978:124; Kenner 1969:85-86).
7

Following the Civil War, buffalo hunters moved into the region and decimated the
enormous herds that once blackened the plains for miles. With their primary food source
gone, the Comanches were forced onto reservations in Oklahoma. Yet reservation life
proved unbearable, and many eventually returned to Texas, led by Chief Quanah Parker.
Their stay was short lived, however. Following a valiant attack on a buffalo hunter
settlement at Adobe Walls in 1874, they were pursued to Palo Duro Canyon by Colonel
Ranald S. Mackenzie and the 4th U.S. Calvary. There, the Comanches, along with their
Kiowa and Cheyenne allies, were routed in a surprise attack. The Indiansâ village was
burned, and their vast herd of over 1400 horses was rounded up for slaughter in Tule
Canyon. Lacking transportation, possessions and food, the Comanches resigned to return to
the reservation, opening the way for waves of Anglo-American settlers from the east (Griggs
1978:124-130).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) maintains records on 140 registered
archaeological sites in Lubbock County (RCRI 2014). The majority of these sites are
located along Yellow House Draw and the North Fork of the Double Mountain Fork of the
Brazos River. Other sites have been documented around playa lakes throughout the county.
A review of THC records revealed that the current project area had no previously
recorded sites within or immediately adjacent to the area. In 1974, site 41LU6 was recorded on
the north side of Yellowhouse Draw east of the current project area approximately one
kilometer. It was reported as a cache of Alibates flakes and one Marshall type projectile point
from the Archaic time period. The site appeared to only be approximately one square foot in
site size.
To the east, the surface was surveyed in 1974-1975 in anticipation of the Canyon Lakes
Park Project in Yellow House Draw in which many sites were recorded. In 1976, those sites
and adjacent lands were designated as the Canyon Lakes Archaeological District in the
National Register of Historic Places. The district was subsequently designated as a State
Archaeological Landmark (RCRI 2014).
Baugh et al. (2005) surveyed portions of the current project for a proposed Northwest
Passage Project that included the construction of roads and installation of utilities. This area
is almost the same as the 1.7 mile proposed water line. However, the previous survey
concentrated its efforts on limited near-surface testing and the current study tested for deeper
potential sub-surface cultural deposits due to the proposed deep impacts. Baugh et al.
(2005:28) recorded one historic archaeological site immediately south of the project area
that consisted of ceramic sherds and glass fragments. The site was determined to be
ineligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and not worthy
of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).

9

PROJECT METHODOLOGY
The project was divided into three phases â archival research, field survey, and report
preparation. The archival research consisted of a check for records of documented sites in
the online âTexas Archeological Sites Atlas,â which is maintained by the Texas Historical
Commission, as well as a review of other literature concerning previous work in the county.
The purpose of the review was twofold - to identify previously recorded sites in the project
area and to compile information relevant to the project from reports of prior archaeological
investigations in the region.
Field Investigation
The field investigation was comprised of a pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching
operations. Fieldwork was conducted in August 2014. Herbert G. Uecker was the Principal
Investigator and Michael R. Bradle served as the Project Archaeologist with assistance from
David C. Scott, Leroy Forbes, and David D. Bradle. Mr. Fred Curnutt, P.E. and vice
president of Enprotec/Hibbs and Todd Inc., and Mr. John Turpin, P.E., a representative of
the City of Lubbock met on-site to confirm the boundaries of the project area and handled
issues regarding utility locations.
The survey involved a systematic walkover of the entire project area at 20 meter
intervals. Surface visibility was approximately 50-80% depending on the locality. Surface
disturbances included two track roads, trails, past road construction, erosion, deflation, and
bioturbidity.
Forty backhoe trenches were excavated (Figure 3) at regular intervals throughout the
project area to test for potential subsurface cultural remains (Figure 3). The trenches
averaged 3 meters long, 1.5 meters wide and 58 centimeters to 2.46 meters deep with an
average depth of 1.04 meters (Appendix II). All of the trenches were excavated to caliche
and Figures 4 and 5 provide a representative sample of the soil horizons present to the
caliche zone. One wall of each trench was troweled and visibly inspected for cultural
remains. Samples of soil from each trench were screened through Â¼â hardware cloth in an
effort to locate any smaller artifacts or cultural deposits.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
A search of the literature and the THC Sites Atlas revealed that no previous
archaeological sites were previously recorded within the project area. There was one site
recorded near the project area, 41LU6, that appeared to be an isolated prehistoric cache.

Field Investigation
The field investigation involved pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching. Forty
backhoe trenches were excavated (see Appendix II). No historic or prehistoric cultural
remains were detected in the trench walls or in excavated matrix, including matrix samples
screened through Â¼â mesh (see Appendix II).
In conclusion, the field investigation conducted by AAG detected no surficial or subsurface archaeological sites or cultural remains. Further, the results of backhoe trenching
conducted during the investigation indicate that practically all of the ground surface and
varying depths of the project area has been extensively impacted by prior earth moving
activities and erosion. This suggests that any surficial remains in the area have likely been
altered or destroyed. There is no evidence to suggest that any significant stratified
archaeological deposits, features, or artifacts are present within the boundaries of the
proposed development for the new Northwest Water Reclamation Plant site and the
associated one mile water line. AAG believes that this project should be allowed to proceed
and no archaeological monitoring is considered necessary during construction.

13

RECOMMENDATIONS
American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction at the location for
the proposed Lubbock Northwest Water Reclamation Plant and Water Line Project be
allowed to proceed. Monitoring during construction by a professional archaeologist is not
considered necessary. However, should any cultural materials be exposed in any area not
discussed in this report, all work in the immediate area must cease until the situation can be
evaluated by American Archaeology Group LLC in consultation with the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission, the City of Lubbock, and Enprotec/Hibbs and
Todd, Inc.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN AND SCOPE OF WORK
Records Check
Prior to entering the field, American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) will contact
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, the state repository
for site records on Texas, to determine if previously recorded sites are present in the project
area. This task may be conducted by a personal visit to TARL or by telephone.
The library at A.A.G. is very extensive, especially regarding reports for the project
area region, and much of the archival work can be accomplished in-house. Since A.A.G. has
conducted work in the area, much of the background work has already been accomplished.
Permit Application
No fieldwork will commence until a permit from the Archeology Division (AD) of
the Texas Historical Commission has been issued. An application for an antiquities permit
will be submitted to AD-THC as soon as A.A.G. receives Notice To Proceed. Normally,
A.A.G. discusses the project with AD personnel before beginning any fieldwork. This is
done to ensure that both parties are in agreement as to the level of work required for this
project.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed utilizing the pedestrian
survey method supported by shovel testing and/or augering and examination of eroded and
disturbed areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Herbert G. Uecker
will act as the Principal Investigator. Shovel testing, augering, and backhoe trenching will
meet and exceed the Minimum Survey Standards For Texas established by the THC.
In areas of poor visibility, and environmental settings that have potential for buried
cultural materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of
high site probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill will be screened
through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually excavated to sterile clay or
bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, camera,
compass, and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches, and
archaeological sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried sites,
select areas in alluvial settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be subjected to
backhoe trenching. All sites identified in the project area will be mapped in the field and
plotted on a topographic map. Site locations will also be determined through the use of a
Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site will be recorded using the official State of
Texas Archeological Site Form. In no case will the survey crew work outside of the project
area as depicted on the project area map provided by the client.
19

Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered
through shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on a
field sack log. They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless a
petition to discard is prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has been
approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be delivered to ADTHC and the client. A.A.G. will maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms, and
any other records produced from the project deemed to be a work product.
Scope of Work
I.

Conduct background check for previously recorded archaeological sites in the project
area and the vicinity. Review the relevant literature.

II.

Discuss the project with the AD-THC reviewer assigned to this project before
entering the field.

III.

Obtain an antiquities permit from AD-THC.

IV.

Consult with the representative of the sponsor before beginning the field survey.

V.

Perform a 100% pedestrian survey of the project area to include shovel testing, and
examination of all exposed areas such as creek banks for buried or displaced
artifacts.

VI.

Check for deeply buried sites through the use of backhoe trenching in areas with
deep soils.

VII.

Analyze all artifacts recovered and prepare them for curation at TARL.

VIII.

Prepare a draft report and submit copies to the AD-THC and the sponsor for review.

IX.

Make all required changes, correct any mistakes, and submit the final report and turn
in the artifacts for curation.
