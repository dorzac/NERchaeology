ABSTRACT
On July 24, 2009 archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. conducted an intensive archeological
survey of a proposed approximately one mile long hike and bike trail along Wonder World Drive in the
City of San Marcos, Hays County, Texas. Investigations discovered historic archeological site 41HY450
that consists of the displaced remains of a dry-stacked limestone wall. Due to poor integrity, a lack of
associated features, a lack of subsurface artifacts, and soil and geologic conditions that are not conducive
to the preservation of intact buried archeological deposits, site 41HY450 is not recommended eligible for
formal State Archeological Landmark designation. No artifacts were collected and curation was
unnecessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Survey of a Proposed Bike and Hike Trail along Wonder World
Drive in the City of San Marcos, Hays County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: At the request of KBR, and on behalf of the City of San Marcos, Blanton
& Associates, Inc (B&A) conducted an archeological records review and an intensive archeological
survey of a proposed approximately 5,000-foot long bike & hike trail along Wonder World Drive (WWD)
in the City of San Marcos, Hays County, Texas. The proposed approximately 5,000-foot long and 10-foot
wide bike & hike trail would extend west and north from the WWD/Hunter Road intersection to connect
with an existing City of San Marcos bike & hike trail. The trail would parallel the south side of WWD
before crossing northward beneath the WWD overpass and across Purgatory Creek. After paralleling the
north side of WWD the trail would then cross back under WWD to connect with an existing City bike and
hike trail on the south side of WWD. The vertical depth of impact would extend a maximum of
approximately 24 inches below the ground surface for minor grading for a flat trail cross slope. The
WWD Extension Project’s (currently under construction) previously surveyed ROW adjacent to (and
encompassing some of) the proposed trail alignment would be used for construction staging so a
construction easement was unnecessary.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is in the City of San Marcos west and north of the
WWD/Hunter Road intersection. The study area is on the San Marcos South, TX (2997-332) USGS 7.5minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 1.15 acres.
DATE OF WORK: July 24, 2009
PURPOSE OF WORK: B&A is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 5344
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: 41HY450
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: 41HY446
COMMENTS: Based on soil and geologic conditions, as well as a lack of subsurface archeological
deposits associated with site 41HY450, B&A recommend that the proposed construction be allowed to
proceed as planned without additional investigations, as the survey discovered no archeological sites
eligible for formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. Given these conditions, it is
unlikely that any previously unknown SALs would be discovered during construction. If the planned
construction should require additional work space outside of the survey area, then additional cultural
resource investigations may be necessary.

INTRODUCTION
On July 24, 2009 archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A) at the request of KBR, and on
behalf of the City of San Marcos, conducted an intensive archeological survey of a proposed
approximately 5,000-foot long bike and hike trail along Wonder World Drive (WWD) in the City of San
Marcos (City), Hays County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2).
The proposed approximately 5,000-foot long and 10-foot wide bike & hike trail would extend west and
north from the WWD/Hunter Drive intersection to connect with an existing City of San Marcos bike &
hike trail. The trail would parallel the south side of WWD before crossing northward beneath the WWD
overpass and across Purgatory Creek. After paralleling the north side of WWD the trail would then cross
back under WWD to connect with an existing City bike and hike trail on the south side of WWD. The
vertical depth of impact would extend a maximum of approximately 24 inches below the ground surface
for minor grading for a flat trail cross slope. The WWD Extension Project’s (currently under construction)
previously surveyed ROW adjacent to (and encompassing some of) the proposed trail alignment would be
used for construction staging so a construction easement was unnecessary.
Because the planned construction would occur on property owned by the City, the proposed project is
subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas
Administrative Code. Protection of archeological sites under state law is tied to eligibility for formal State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. This legislation defines the
necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of SALs and requires that any state agency must
identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage
those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Division of Archeology administers the code’s
provisions. Archeological surveys must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the
THC in accordance with the provisions of the code. This project was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 5344 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
The intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources discovered within the
project area, evaluate their potential eligibility for formal SAL designation and if significant cultural
resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as
avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is situated along the Balcones Escarpment (Spearing 1991:35) and consists
predominately of previous ranch land. The natural topography of parts of the study area north and west of
Purgatory Creek has been significantly altered or removed by the previous construction of dams and a
spillway by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in 1974 for flood control on Purgatory Creek.
GEOLOGY
Geologically, the bike & hike trail is underlain by Lower Cretaceous age Edwards Limestone that consists
of limestone, dolomite, and chert. (Barnes 1974).
SOILS
The proposed trail route traverses soils of the Rumple-Comfort association, undulating, Orif soils,
frequently flooded, and Anhalt clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (Batte 1984). The Rumple-Comfort association,
undulating, consists of shallow to moderately deep and very cherty and stony upland clay loam that is
dark reddish brown to dark brown and contains an increasingly greater Volume of chert and limestone
gravels with depth. Both Comfort and Rumple soils developed in situ from limestone and clay weathered
from limestone. Anhalt clay, one to three percent slopes, is an upland soil located near the northern
terminus of the planned trail. This soil developed in situ from clayey residuum from weathered limestone,
is dark reddish gray to a depth of about 20 centimeters, and has little potential for containing intact buried
archeological deposits (Batte 1984).
Along Purgatory Creek are Orif soils, frequently flooded. These soils are gravelly, loamy, sandy, and
developed from recent gravelly alluvium. The soil consists of about 50 centimeters (0 to 50 centimeters
below ground surface) of grayish brown loamy sand that is about 50 percent limestone pebbles, gravels,
and cobbles. From 50 centimeters plus below ground surface is brown very gravelly loamy sand that is 75
percent limestone pebbles, gravels, and cobbles (Batte 1984).
FLORA
The vegetation in the project area consists of plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformis)-Ashe juniper
(Juniperus ashei) woodlands, with lesser amounts of Texas oak (Q. buckleyi), sugar hackberry (Celtis
laevigata), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), escarpment black cherry (Prunus serotina var. eximius), and
Texas walnut (Juglans microcarpa var. microcarpa). The understory of woodland patches and the edges
of openings are generally well-developed with Ashe juniper limbs, vines, and various shrubs, including
Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), agarito (Berberis trifoliata), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), flameleaf
sumac (Rhus copallinum), elbow bush (Foretiera pubescens), saw greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox), and
grape (Vitis spp.). Herbaceous vegetation consists of native and introduced grasses and forbs. Common
grasses include silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), King Ranch bluestem (B. ischaemum), grama
grasses (Bouteloua spp.), johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), threeawn grasses (Aristida spp.), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and fall witchgrass (Digitaria
cognata). Common forbs in the project corridor include fine-leaf bluets (Hedyotis nigricans), prairie

bee balm (Monarda citriodora) white milkwort (Polygala alba), cedar caric-sedge (Carex planostachys),
and Virginia frostweed (Verbesina virginica var. virginica).

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A review of records available online from the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was
conducted to determine the presence of previously recorded sites and previous project areas in or near the
study area. The review indicated that since 1974 the WWD Extension Project corridor and adjacent areas
have been investigated several times with overlapping project areas, resulting in a number of previously
recorded sites near the proposed trail.
In 1974 the SCS sponsored the construction of dams and floodways along and adjacent to Purgatory
Creek that flows through the current study area. Parts of the SCS project area overlaps with the
southwestern corner of the WWD corridor. It appears that no sites were recorded during those
investigations (TASA 2009).
Early archeological investigations occurred in and around the WWD corridor were sponsored by
Southwest Texas State University’s (SWTSU) Anthropology Department. These investigations consisted
of summer archeological field school survey and test excavations by students of SWTSU. During several
summers (1983 through 1985) of investigations, participants surveyed and conducted test excavations at
several prehistoric sites, including prehistoric to historic aboriginal site 41HY163. This site was reported
to have numerous cultural features and artifacts that indicate the existence of several specific activity
areas (e.g., cooking, primary reduction of lithic cores, butchering, and other domestic activities). The
research provided information on the formation of burned rock middens and an oval posthole pattern in
the domestic activity area was uncovered and dated to the Transitional Archaic (Garber 1985). Because
of the impending impacts from the extension of WWD, 41HY163 was recently (2007) subjected to data
recovery excavations (see below).
In 1995 the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) conducted a survey of FM 2439 (Hunter Road)
from FM 3407 (Wonder World Drive) to 1.33 kilometers south prior to proposed roadway improvements.
The survey discovered previously unknown prehistoric and Spanish (part of El Camino Real) site
41HY263, which contained one Late Archaic untyped dart point, one Marshall-like projectile point, lithic
debitage, and burned limestone rock. Additionally, a section of El Camino Real parallels the east side of
FM 2439 and is clearly visible at Willow Springs Creek (TxDOT 1995).
The City sponsored archeological survey investigations in 2002 of the proposed 79-acre WWD Extension
Corridor. Investigations resulted in the re-recording of three previously recorded prehistoric sites
(41HY153, 41HY163, and 41HY192) and the discovery of one new historic archeological site
(41HY323) consisting of an isolated rock-lined cistern with no associated structural remains or artifact
scatters. Considerable effort was put into re-recording and mapping site 41HY163, resulting in
recommendations for test excavations (Karbula et al. 2003).
In 2007 data recovery excavations were undertaken at 41HY163 by Texas State University’s Center for
Archaeological Studies (report in preparation). Data recovery was necessary as all of the site could not be
avoided despite being spanned with a bridge. Excavations resulted in the recovery of prehistoric to early
Historic human remains (personal communication City of San Marcos, report in preparation). Another
phase of archeological survey was undertaken for additional elements (e.g., water quality pond) related to

the WWD Extension Project that resulted in the discovery of previously unrecorded site 41HY446 where
archeologists recovered metal arrowpoints from a single shovel test, as well as lithic tools and burned
rock with carbonaceous soil suggestive of a buried feature. This site is adjacent to parts of the planned
trail near the intersection of WWD and Hunter Road (TASA 2009).

HISTORIC BACKGROUND
Spanish missions were the earliest attempt at European colonization on the southern margins of the
Edwards Plateau. In 1755, the San Xavier missions and presidio of San Francisco Xavier were established
in what is now the San Marcos area, only to be relocated less than one year later (Handbook of Texas
Online 2009; Texas Beyond History 2009). The area remained unsettled for another 50 years until a
second colonization effort occurred in 1808 when the Spanish governor of Texas, Manuel Antonio
Cordero y Bustamante promoted the settlement of San Marcos de Neve. This second settlement was near
the same site attempted 50 years prior. The settlement was abandoned in 1812 following struggles with
flooding and hostilities with local indigenous groups (Handbook of Texas Online 2009).
Following the War for Mexican Independence, the government of Coahuila and Texas issued land grants
in the area to Juan Martín Veramendi (1831), Juan Vicente Campos (1832), and Thomas Jefferson
Chambers (1834) as a means to encourage settlement. It is reported that the earliest permanent AngloAmerican settler in the area was former Texas Ranger Thomas G. McGehee. McGehee, formerly a
member of John C. Hays Texas Ranger Company, was farming on a league of land in 1846 north of the
site of present day San Marcos that he received in 1835 from the Mexican government. By 1847, the area
saw the establishment of the first post office and store by Caton Erhard and an influx of other former
members of John C. Hays's company of Texas Rangers (Handbook of Texas Online 2009).
By March 1848, when the Texas Legislature organized Hays County and chose San Marcos as the new
county seat, the town had a population of 387 people. The Texas Legislature organized Hays County on
March 1, 1848, and designated the young community as the county seat. San Marcos already had 387
residents. That same year, stagecoach service between Austin and San Antonio was begun and the town
began its development as a commercial center. In 1851, a 640-acre section of the Juan Veramendi grant
was commandeered and laid out for the town center. Between 1848 and 1870 the population of the city
only increased to approximately 750 residents. Slowed for a while by the Civil War the population by
1870 had only grown to 742, but following the arrival of the International-Great Northern Railroad in
1881 there was an increase to 2,335. In that decade the town supported two banks, an opera house, and a
variety of stores, saloons, and other businesses (Handbook of Texas Online 2009).
Cattle and cotton played major roles in San Marcos’ steady development to the mid-twentieth century.
The opening of Southwest Texas State Normal School in 1903 and San Marcos Baptist Academy in 1907
established education as an important local industry that has continued into the twenty-first century. By
1940, San Marcos had a population of approximately 5,500 served by 200 businesses. During the late
1940s and 1950s, the city's economy diversified again due to the light industry and manufacturing that
World War II initiated (Handbook of Texas Online 2009).
By the 1960s, tourism became an important component San Marcos’ economy with the opening of
Aquarena Springs and Wonder Cave. Southwest Texas State University also expanded at this time,
ensuring the city’s role as a regional education center. Ultimately education as the single largest employer
in the city, as well as contributing to an almost 50 percent increase in the city's population from just under
13,000 in 1962 to almost 19,000 in 1972 (Handbook of Texas Online 2009).

San Marcos continued to grow through the 1970s and 1980s with manufacturing (e.g., construction
materials, plastics, and telecommunications) still accounting for a significant proportion of the economy.
The growth of Austin over the past 30 years has also contributed to the development and expansion of
San Marcos. By the mid-1980s, San Marcos had a population of 45,000, 20,000 of which were students.
Between 1990 and 2000, the population of San Marcos increased from 28,743 to 34,733 (Handbook of
Texas Online 2009).

METHODS
B&A conducted an intensive 100 percent pedestrian archeological survey of the proposed bike and hike
trail with subsurface investigations as per discussions with THC on 23 April 2009 and as necessary based
on field conditions. Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent inspection of the ground surface
within the planned trail corridor, as well as those areas adjacent to and visible from the corridor.
Given the geology and soils of the project area, as well as the previous THC coordination, systematic
shovel testing was not necessary along the entirety of the proposed trail alignment. Rather, systematic
shovel testing was conducted along an approximately 600-foot long section north of adjacent site
41HY446 and approximately 1,200 feet of the northern end of the trail from the east side of WWD to the
north project terminus.
Shovel tests (STs) were 30 x 30 centimeters in size and excavated with a spade or standard round point
shovel in arbitrary 20-centimeter levels. All soils removed from shovel tests were screened through 0.25inch wire mesh to ensure artifact recovery. All appropriate data was recorded on a B&A shovel test form
and each shovel test was plotted with hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receivers. Because
much of the surrounding area was surveyed (and excavated in some instances) for archeological resources
within the last two years on behalf of the City for the on-going WWD Extension Project, and discussions
with THC, backhoe trenching was not warranted.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council
of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.).

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Given the density of previously recorded prehistoric sites in the area, during survey investigations
archeologists contended with a discontinuous surface scatter of prehistoric debitage across the majority
of the study area. Because of its low density, ubiquity and displacement by previous impacts, this
background noise was not recorded as an archeological site. Surface examinations discovered no formal
prehistoric chipped-stone tools, tool fragments, or prehistoric cultural features. Subsurface investigations
along approximately 1,200 feet of the northern end of the planned trail from the east side of WWD to the
north project terminus included the excavation of STs 1 through 9, while the excavation of STs 10
through 20 occurred along the approximately 600-foot long section in the southern end of the study area
(Figure 3 and Table 1).
Shovel tests in the north part of the project area extended to a maximum depth of 38 centimeters below
ground surface and yielded no buried archeological material, only very dense and rocky clay loam
overlying marl and/or limestone bedrock gravels. Approximately 500 feet southeast of the northern end of
the planned trail is an approximately 100- x 100-foot enclosure that was presumably used for sheep or
goats, as the enclosure is primarily constructed of goat/sheep fencing (Figure 4). All construction
materials (e.g., wire nails, milled lumber, goat/sheep fencing, and posts set in concrete) and debris (e.g.,
beer bottles and galvanized water tanks, one of which retains parts of its paper label) are modern. The
excavation of STs 4 through 9 in the enclosure revealed less than 30 centimeters of very rocky/gravelly
clay loam overlying marl or limestone bedrock, none of which has a potential for containing intact buried
archeological deposits. Given those circumstances, it is B&A’s opinion (which the THC concurred with
on 9 September 2009) that the enclosure does not warrant archeological site status.
In the southern end of the project area, archeologists excavated STs 10 through 20 near the eastern
boundary of previously recorded prehistoric site 41HY446 to determine if the site extended into the
proposed trail alignment. Shovel test excavations extended to a maximum depth of 45 centimeters below
ground surface (e.g., ST 16) and yielded no buried archeological materials, only rocky to very rocky clay
loam overlying limestone bedrock gravels. These soils developed in situ from weathered limestone and
have no potential for containing intact buried archeological material.
Although subsurface investigations discovered no buried archeological material, survey efforts discovered
historic archeological site 41HY450 in the northern end of the project area.
SITE DESCRIPTION
41HY450
Site 41HY450 is an approximately 300-foot long x 3-foot wide x 2-foot tall north-south trending partially
collapsed stacked-stone wall just a few meters northeast of the proposed trail (Figure 5). Survey efforts
discovered the wall in a tree line on the mid-slope of an upland ridge above an unnamed tributary of
Purgatory Creek. Due to displacement, scattered wall stones parallel the remaining partially intact lowest
courses of stone that extend two feet or less above the ground surface (Figure 6). The wall remnants
include large (approximately 24- x 18-inch) to small (approximately four inches in diameter) tabular and

sub-angular, dry-laid limestone rocks presumably collected on location and/or nearby, as similar stones
are ubiquitous on the ground surface throughout the study area. Surface investigations discovered no
associated artifacts other than the rusted barbed wire strands.
ST 3 was excavated on the planned trail alignment within a few meters of the wall and yielded no
archeological material; only shallow (< 20 centimeters) very rocky clay loam over limestone bedrock (see
Table 1). Because this soil developed in situ from weathered limestone and has no potential for containing
intact buried archeological material, additional excavation was unwarranted, while a series of unrecorded
shovel probes across the remainder of the site that verified similar soil conditions.
The stonewall was likely constructed in the late nineteenth to early twentieth century and may have
functioned as part of an animal (sheep?) pen or property corner. It is reasonable to hypothesize that this
site was associated with previously recorded site 41HY323, a historic cistern discovered in the proposed
WWD extension ROW during the 2002 archeological survey prior to the proposed roadway construction
(Karbula et al. 2003). The site contained no additional features and there was no trace of the house that
was presumably once associated with the cistern (Karbula et al. 2003). Site 41HY323 was determined not
eligible for SAL designation or for inclusion to the NRHP by TxDOT archeologists and the THC, and the
cistern was demolished and removed from the ROW prior to roadway construction. Based on the original
site description, 41HY323 was approximately 600 feet west of this site and it is B&A’s opinion that the

sites were on the same property and the previous archival research undertaken for site 41HY323 by
Karbula et al. (2003:42–44) is applicable.
It was determined that the property in question was probably originally part of both the 1831 Juan Martín
Veramendi land grant and the adjacent 1834 Thomas Jefferson Chambers land grant (Karbula et al. 2003:
42). Based on their (Karbula et al. 2003: 42) research, 41HY450 appears to be on property patented
sometime in the late nineteenth century by Pleasant Young (General Land Office file 507/4, B-1-33). This
was some time prior to 1900 but Karbula et al. (2003:43) explain that deficiencies in the deed records
prevent determination of a complete line of ownership.
Following Young’s patent, Martin Weiss sold 286 acres (of the Thomas Jefferson Chambers grant) in
July 1900 to Francis Leinnewebber (Hays County Deed Records Volume 39, page 287), who in turn sold
the property to T. G. Harris in 1904 (Hays County Deed Records Volume 46, page 202) (Karbula et al.
2003:43). A gap in the deed records is reported from 1904 to early 1911 until W. T. Watkins sold 276 of
286 acres to J. H. Smith on July 17, 1911 (Hays County Deed Records Volume 60, page 579) (Karbula et
al. 2003: Table 5).

Four months after J. H. Smith purchased the property he sold it to J. H. Williams (Hays County Deed
Records Volume 61, page 60) who retained ownership until June 1913 (Hays County Deed Records
Volume 62, page 639) when he sold it to W. R. Cunningham who only owned the property until
September 1914, at which time it was sold to E. J. Leath (Hays County Deed Records Volume 68, page
93) (Karbula et al. 2003: Table 5).
E. J. Leath apparently retained ownership until March 22, 1917 when the 276-acre property was conveyed
to Albert Grosgebauer (Hays County Deed Records Volume 71, page 390), who sold the property exactly
12 months later to Mr. and Mrs. William Connally (Hays County Deed Records volume 81, page 127)
(Karbula et al. 2003: 43 and Table 5). In November 1927 Will G. Barber purchased the property from
William Connally (Hays County Deed Records Volume 81, page 127) and at some undetermined point
after that date Barber sold approximately 50 acres to Arnulfo Lucio (Hays County Deed Records Volume
95, page 445) (Karbula et al. 2003: 43 and Table 5).
Between the late 1920s and 1978, the Lucio family accumulated approximately 200 acres of adjacent
parcels from both the Juan Martín Veramendi and Thomas Jefferson Chambers land grants (Hays County
Deed Records Volumes 112, 165 and 317; pages 330, 167 and 390 respectively) but in 1998 Terrand, Ltd.
purchased the property (Karbula et al. 2003: Table 5), which has since been sold and/or donated to the
City of San Marcos, except for the TxDOT owned Wonder World Drive ROW.
Any of the late nineteenth and twentieth century occupations of the property (with the exception of
Terrand, Ltd.) could have been responsible for the stonewall comprising site 41HY450 . Given the lack of
structural integrity, no apparent unusual construction techniques, no associated features, and soil and
geologic conditions that are not conducive to the preservation of intact archeological deposits, it is the
opinion of B&A that the research value of this site is low and no further investigations are recommended.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive archeological survey of the proposed WWD bike and hike trail resulted in the discovery of
previously unrecorded historic archeological site 41HY450, a partially collapsed late nineteenth to
twentieth century dry-stacked stonewall. Subsurface testing in the southern part of the project area found
no evidence that previously recorded site 41HY446 extends into the proposed trail alignment. Site
41HY450 was likely associated with 41HY323; a historic cistern previously located about 600 feet to the
west. Subsurface investigations (e.g., STs 2 and 3) discovered no buried artifacts associated with the site.
Previous archival research (Karbula et al. 2003: 42 and Table 5) for 41HY323 determined the site did not
warrant formal SAL designation nor was it recommended eligible for inclusion to the NRHP (Karbula et
al. 2003:47).
B&A’s investigations also noted a livestock enclosure in the northern end of the project area was
constructed of modern (late twentieth century) materials and B&A archeologists determined it did not
warrant site status. Systematic subsurface testing along approximately 1,800 feet of the planned trail
discovered no buried archeological material, only shallow (typically < 30 centimeters) very rocky to
rocky clay loam overlying marl and/or limestone bedrock.
Based on the above data, in conjunction with wall’s lack of structural integrity and common construction
techniques, it is the opinion of B&A that site 41HY450 is not eligible for formal SAL designation.
Further, it is B&A’s opinion that soil and geologic conditions across the study area that are not conducive
to the preservation of intact archeological deposits and has no potential to contain previously unidentified
SALs. B&A recommends therefore that because no SALs would be impacted, the proposed construction
should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional investigations.
If a different trail alignment is chosen or additional work space is necessary then B&A recommend that
additional investigations in those areas may be necessary. In the event that previously unidentified
cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area of discovery would
cease and the THC will be contacted to initiate accidental discovery procedures.
