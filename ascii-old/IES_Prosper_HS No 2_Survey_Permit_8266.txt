ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES)
for the Prosper High School #2 Project in the Town of Prosper, Collin County, Texas.
The direct APE encompasses approximately 129 acres (ac) and was comprised of a 100ac proposed school site fronting Coit Road with an associated 2.1-mile (mi; 29-ac)
sanitary sewer pipeline corridor that extends west, along Parvin Branch from the
proposed school location to Preston Road (State Highway [SH] 289). As the Town of
Prosper is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, it is required to comply with the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, as the project will require a Section 404
of the Clean Water Act (CWA) Individual Permit (IP) from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), portions of the project are subject to the provisions of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. All work conformed to 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800, and 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26,
which outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT,
respectively.
The goal of this survey was to locate, identify, and document any cultural resources,
which included architectural and archeological resources, that could be adversely affected
by the proposed development and to evaluate such resources for their potential eligibility
for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). These investigations consisted of a records
review to identify previously conducted cultural resources surveys in the area and the
known archeological and architectural resources recorded by those efforts, visual
reconnaissance of the project area, subsurface investigations via systematic shovel test
excavation, and archival research.
The cultural resources survey was conducted by archeologists Anne Gibson, Pat
Donahue, and Christopher Goodmaster on 10 January and 01 February 2018, under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 8266. Although three historic-period archeological sites
(41COL305, 41COL310, and 41COL311) and two architectural resources were
documented during the field survey, based on each site’s lack of association with a
significant historical event(s) or person(s) and low potential to yield significant
archeological data, the sites are deemed not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or
designation as SALs.
Based on the results of this survey, no additional evaluation or mitigation is warranted for
the identified cultural resources. It is the recommendation of IES that the State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented by the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
concur with these findings. However, if any cultural resources (other than those
documented within this report) are encountered during construction, the operators should
cease work immediately in that area and contact the project environmental representative
to initiate coordination with the THC prior to resuming any construction activities. No
artifacts were collected during this survey. All field and project-related records will be
temporarily curated at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1 Introduction
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under subcontract to Teague, Nall, and Perkins, LLC on behalf of the Prosper
Independent School District (ISD) for the proposed Prosper High School #2 School Site and Off-Site
Sanitary Sewer Project. As the Town of Prosper is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, it is
required to comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, the project will require a
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) Individual Permit (IP) from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE). Therefore, portions of the project are subject to the provisions of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. All work conformed to 36 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Part 800, and 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations
for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. A description of the proposed
project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE), environmental and historical contexts, field and analytical
methods, results of the investigations, and recommendations regarding the identified cultural resources
are provided in this document. This report was prepared in accordance with the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA 2002) guidelines and satisfies the NHPA Section 106 requirements of the proposed
project.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Direct APE
The APE is located south of U.S. Highway (US) 380 between Preston Road (State Highway [SH] 289)
and Coit Road in the Town of Prosper, Collin County, Texas (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). The direct APE
encompasses approximately 129 acres (ac) and comprises a proposed 100-ac school site fronting Coit
Road with an associated 2.1-mile (mi) sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline corridor that extends west from
the proposed school grounds to Preston Road (SH 289) following Parvin Branch. Although overall
designs for the project were in the early stages of planning during the drafting of this report, Prosper ISD
plans to construct a multi-building high school campus that will include classroom buildings, athletic
fields, parking lots, associated infrastructure, and landscaping elements. Potential subsurface impacts
anticipated at the school site include standard construction procedures associated with large-scale
academic developments such as grading of the ground surface, installation of storm drains and utilities,
and building foundations. The proposed sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline will require a 20-foot wide
permanent easement and a temporary construction easement varying in width from 80 to 120 feet (ft),
encompassing a 29-ac area. Ground disturbances associated with the sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline
will include open-cut trenching and conventional boring, as well as grubbing of vegetation from wooded
areas. Field investigations assessed to the depth of proposed construction or the depth of soils capable of
containing archeological resources.
Indirect APE
Since the project requires compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA, an assessment of indirect effects
was necessary. The sole potential indirect effect of the proposed project was related to potential visual
effects, associated with the construction of multiple, above-ground buildings, on historic-age architectural
resources in the vicinity. To account for these potential above ground elements, a 300-ft wide indirect
effects APE surrounding the direct effects APE of the proposed school location was reviewed and
evaluated. Thus, all standing structures or buildings of historic age (i.e., 45 years old or greater)
encountered within the footprint of proposed construction (the direct APE), or within the indirect APE,
were photographed and assessed for potential NRHP eligibility.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Collin County lies in the north-central part of the State of Texas. Annual rainfall averages between
approximately 35 and 42 inches (in). About half of the rain usually falls between April and May, with
July and August being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively
mild year-round temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and cold periods (Estaville and
Earl 2008).
Topographic Setting, Geology, and Soils
The Frisco 7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map illustrates the APE
as being situated on a prominent ridge that separates Parvin Branch and Rutherford Branch (see Figure
1.2). Topography within proposed high school grounds gently slope to the southwest. The headwaters of
Parvin Branch form approximately 0.4 mi southeast of the APE and cross the southwest corner of the
proposed school location while flowing to the northwest. The proposed sanitary sewer follows Parvin
Branch as it meanders west through the side slope of an interfluvial divide that separates the East Fork
Trinity River and the Elm Fork Trinity River watersheds. The topography surrounding Parvin Branch
becomes increasingly more pronounced moving west. Current designs call for the sewer to cross Parvin
Branch at seven locations. Parvin Branch confluences with Panther Creek approximately 2.1 mi west of
the sewer APE terminus at Preston Road.
The APE is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie subregion of the Texas Blackland Prairie
ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007, Gould et al. 1960). The Northern Blackland Prairie is distinguished from
surrounding regions by gently rolling hills and fine-textured, black clayey soils that predominantly
support prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2007). This area is located within the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950; Dice 1943). Vertic soils (vertisols) dominate the Blackland Prairie ecoregion and contain
high clay content significant shrink and swell potential. The soils of the area are predominantly
developed from in situ weathering of the underlying carbonate geological formations of the region. Soils
within the APE are underlain by the Cretaceous-age Austin Chalk (Kau) and Eagle Ford (Kef) formations
with undivided Quaternary-aged alluvial deposits in proximity to the Parvin Branch channel (McGowen
et al 1991; Scoggins 2004; Figure 2.1). The Austin Chalk Formation is characterized by massive chalk
deposits with thin marl interbeds. The Eagle Ford Formation is comprised of shale, sandstone, and
limestone.
As shown by the Soil Survey of Collin County, Texas, there are eight mapped soils within the APE
(Hanson and Wheeler 1969; Table 2.1). The entire APE contains soils typical of upland settings within
the Northern Blackland Prairie. Soil data was viewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (USDA 2017; Figure 2.2).

3.1 Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database, maintained by the THC, indicates that eight
previous professional cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the vicinity (i.e., 1 mi [1.6
kilometers (km)]) of the APE (Table 3.1; Figure 3.1). As a result of these prior surveys, one
archeological site has been previously recorded in the vicinity. TASA records further indicate that no
National Register properties, historical markers, or cemeteries are located within the APE (TASA 2018).

3.2 Regional Historical Background
Collin County
Although the establishment of the first Spanish missions in the early 1700s denotes the beginning of the
historic period in the State of Texas, European settlement within the region was sparse. Early Spanish
exploration was limited to areas along the Rio Grande River and along the coast. The limited settlement
within North-Central Texas, prior to the mid-1800s, was due to the hostile relations with the Native
American Comanche, Kiowa, and Wichita tribes (Minor 2016).
However, after the Republic of Texas was established in 1836, 180 million acres were opened for
settlement. To entice settlers from the United States, large land grants, bounties, headrights, and
premiums were issued to those who qualified. One such land grant was issued to William S. Peters, an
English businessman who immigrated to the United States in 1827. Peters was an empresario (or
immigration agent) who received several land grant contracts from the Republic. The first of these
contracts resulted in the formation of Peter’s colony (Figure 3.2). The terms of the contract required the
empresario to recruit settlers from outside the Republic at a rate of 200 families within a 3-year period. In
return, the colonists were to be granted 320 acres per single man and a maximum of 640 acres

per family. The empresario was allowed to retain up to one-half of a colonist’s grants as payment for
services rendered, including land surveys and title applications. The empresario provided powder, shot,
and seed, and in some cases, built settlers’ cabins. The empresario also received 10 sections of premium
land from the Republic for every 100 families they settled (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958).
Although the endeavor of Peter’s colony was riddled with confusion of ownership and other difficulties,
Collin County witnessed continued growth and economic stability throughout the Republic of Texas years
and after Texas was annexed into the United States in December 1845. After Lincoln’s election in 1860,
Texas secessionists called for a vote that resulted in a decree of succession. Most Collin County residents
opposed the call for Texas to secede from the Union by a vote of 948 to 405. However, the people of
Texas as a whole loyally supported the South. The popular vote was 46,129 to 14,697 in favor of
secession and on March 5, 1861 Texas joined the Confederacy (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958).
While Collin County was spared the horrors of invading Union troops, the civilian population still
suffered. Practically every able-bodied man between the ages of 17 to 50 was in the army. Food was
scarce and Union sympathizers, deserters, and criminals were a constant threat to the families left behind.
Following the Civil War, hostilities continued during the Reconstruction Period as exemplified by the
Lee-Peacock feud. Robert Lee, who was an ex-confederate officer, and Lewis Peacock, who was a Union
sympathizer, were involved in one of the most prolific post-Civil War feuds in North-Central Texas.
Although it is unclear exactly how the feud began, hostilities arose when Lee was kidnapped and extorted
by Peacock and his supporters. Their feud terrorized what was known as the “Five Corners” region
(corners of Collin, Grayson, Fannin, and Hunt counties) for four years (1867 to 1871) and ended with the
death of both men (Hall and Hall 2009, Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958).
It was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that the fertile nature of Collin County and NorthCentral Texas was capitalized upon and became an important regional center for producing and
processing cotton, wheat, and corn. Ancillary industries developed in association with these cash crops,
including; grain elevators, flour mills, cotton gins, compresses, cotton oil mills, and a textile mill. Cotton
developed as the key agricultural product for the region and increased its stronghold in 1872 with the
arrival of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. Cotton producers no longer had to endure the slow
overland transportation of their cotton to markets in east Texas, making cotton extremely profitable. Crop
production continues in Collin County today, but its significance in the local economy diminished after
World War II (WWII) when cattle production and dairy farming became more common (Hall and Hall

2009, Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958). Collin County saw dramatic changes in the 1980s. The
introduction of the lighting industry and the sudden growth of the Dallas metropolitan area led to a more
diverse economy focused on industry, technology, and services, and less on agriculture. This trend has
continued to present day.
The Town of Prosper
In 1914, the Town of Prosper incorporated and contained a population of 500. The town served as a
market center for cotton and corn farmers in the county. Within 20 years, the town provided its residents
with electricity, natural gas, water, paved roads, a high school, a bank, and housed 25 businesses.
Community growth was halted during the Great Depression. The population dropped to 271 and
continued to decline into the 1950’s. It was not until 1970 that Prosper’s population reached 500 again
(Minor 2016). By 2000, the population had increased to 2,317 and hosted numerous businesses that
served the residents and farmers who lived nearby. This population has grown exponentially, having
exceeded 18,000 residents by 2016.

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Collin County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas, Sherman Sheet, the USGS topographic map, the
NRCS digital soil database for Collin County, the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Dallas District, the National Archives and Records
Administration’s (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Collin County, the Texas Historic
Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and both past and current aerial photography.
Prehistoric Resource Potential
High School #2 Location APE
According to the TXDOT PALM for the Dallas District, the proposed high school site APE contains a
low potential for shallow and deeply buried cultural materials. Additionally, approximately 89 percent of
the APE has experienced agricultural cultivation since before 1952, which negates the potential for
encountering intact shallow prehistoric cultural materials.
Off-Site Sanitary Sewer Interceptor Pipeline APE
According to the TxDOT PALM, approximately 32 percent of the sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline
APE features a high potential for containing shallow and deeply buried cultural materials, within a
reasonable context. These areas are located within the central portions of the APE and near Preston Road.
Approximately 57 percent of the APE is comprised of a moderate potential for containing shallow or
deeply buried cultural materials. The remaining 11 percent of the APE, located within approximately 350
feet of the eastern terminus of the APE, is comprised of a low potential for containing cultural materials.
During background review, it was determined that approximately 34 percent of the APE has been
disturbed. These areas are concentrated within the eastern half of the APE and feature a diminished
potential for containing intact cultural resources.
Historic-Period Resource Potential
High School #2 Location APE
Historic and modern aerial photography depict that the property parcel within and directly adjacent to the
APE was primarily used for agricultural activities since prior to 1952. The 1930 USDA soils map for
Collin County illustrates that a structure was located in the northeast corner of the APE. This structure
was verified as a farmstead consisting of a dwelling, a barn, and two associated outbuildings on historical
aerial photography from 1952. Modern aerial photography depicts the dwelling and barn as having the

same footprint and structural elements as those visible in 1952 and 1968. Additional structures have been
constructed since 1968; however, these later structures are not of historic age. During delineation of
potential USACE jurisdictional waters, IES biologists observed a potential hand-dug well along the
western boundary of the APE. Although the well is not observable on aerial photography, it is likely
associated with the historic-aged farmstead. As such, the potential for encountering historic-period
cultural resources within the northeastern corner of the APE is high.
Off-Site Sanitary Sewer Interceptor Pipeline APE
Historic and modern aerial photography depict that the property parcel within and directly adjacent to the
APE was primarily used for agricultural activities since at least 1968. The 1930 USDA soils map for
Collin County illustrates that the APE was void of historic-period structures. This was verified on
historic-period aerial photography. A historic-period farmstead is present on aerial photography from
1968 approximately 100 feet south of the eastern terminus of the pipeline APE. However, the farmstead
is located on the opposite bank of Parvin Branch. As such, the APE is considered to have a low potential
for containing historical period cultural resources.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
Prior to fieldwork, IES staff conducted historical and archeological records reviews to determine
previously recorded resources within the APE and within a 1-mi (1.6-km) radius of the direct APE (see
Section 3.1). IES staff also reviewed ecological, geological, and soils data, as well as historical and
modern topographic maps and aerial photography of the APE. The archeological survey for the Prosper
High School #2 location and off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline was conducted on 10 January and
01 February 2018. The methods utilized during this survey exceed the minimum archeological survey
standards requirements for field investigations recommended by the CTA (CTA 1996, 2001), as approved
by the THC.

4.1 Survey Methods
Through the background review, it was determined that the APE possess a wide range of potential for
encountering cultural resources. For these reasons, an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing was
limited to high probability areas (HPA) within the approximately 129-ac Prosper High School #2 location
APE (Figure 4.1). The HPA model was developed by applying a 300-ft buffer around historic-aged
building and structure locations identified through background research and by IES field biologists during
CWA Section 404 waters of the United States delineation. The HPA also included any areas within 300
ft of all identified waters of the United States and within areas designated as high potential within the
PALM. HPA boundaries did not denote the specific limits of the intensive survey but were expanded or
contracted depending on field observations.
Within the Prosper High School #2 location APE, survey transects were spaced at 30-m intervals. Within
the off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline APE, the transect survey consisted of single and multiple
transect methods. Portions of the off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline APE that comprised a
corridor width of 100 ft or less were surveyed with a single pedestrian survey transect, with shovel tests
excavated in 100-m intervals. Portions of the off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline APE with a
corridor width greater than 100 ft were assessed using two pedestrian survey transects with shovel tests
excavated in 100-m staggered intervals along the two transects. With few exceptions, the intensive
survey transpired only within HPA. However, 100 percent of the APE was assessed through pedestrian
reconnaissance transect survey. Areas previously impacted by significant ground disturbances were
assessed through reconnaissance survey to determine the potential for intact archeological deposits.
Shovel Testing
In areas with the potential to preserve buried archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to 80
centimeters (cm) or the extent of soils capable of containing cultural deposits, typically the argillic soil
horizon (Bt) or regolith. Each shovel test was at least 30 cm in diameter and was hand excavated in
natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using ¼-inch
hardware mesh to facilitate the recovery of buried cultural material. All shovel tests were recorded on
maps and plotted using handheld global positioning system (GPS) units. Investigators documented the
results of each shovel test on standardized forms. All shovel tests, cultural features, and other site data
was geospatially recorded using Trimble GeoXT handheld GPS units.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in imperial units (e.g., in, ft,
mi) within this report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in metric units (e.g., cm,
m, km), unless historic-period artifact or architectural elements are more appropriately recorded in
imperial units.

Site Recording
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural resources.
The recognition of a “site” is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent. Content may refer
to artifacts or cultural features encountered in surface or subsurface contexts, architectural elements, or
other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the vertical and horizontal
spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five or more
artifacts of at least two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically
a 400 square meter [m2] [0.1-ac] area) or at least one cultural feature. The extent of the surface artifacts
and cultural features are then defined as the site boundary. When artifacts or features are encountered in
buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive excavations. In cases where
an excavated survey sampling location (i.e., shovel test) yields cultural materials, additional delineation
excavations are conducted to define the boundary of the site. The spatial extent of the site is defined
within the extent of positive excavations. Archeological sites may also be defined within the extent of
surface artifacts or features and culturally positive excavations when both are present.
Cultural remains, meeting these criteria, are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site
Data Form, and submitted to TARL to be included in the TASA database. Conversely, discovery of
cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are considered isolated occurrences of past human
activity and are simply documented by location and content. Modern materials and features (i.e., less
than 50 years old) are not considered sites, with only location and content documented. Depending on
depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or
for designation as SALs. Cultural isolates and modern features are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
or for designation as SALs because of their failure to meet the site definition and their inability to
contribute important information to the understanding of history or prehistory.
Archival Research
Historic-aged maps and aerial photographs encompassing the direct APE and indirect APE were reviewed
to determine the locations of historic-age (e.g., greater than 50 years old) structures. Deed/title research
was conducted for archeological sites that contained evidence of historic-period site components and
historic-period architectural resources. The purpose was to identify historically notable persons that were
possibly associated with any resource documented during this survey. Initial research was carried out by
examining deed and land title records from the Collin County Clerk’s office. The historic significance of
identified persons associated with each resource were also researched using The Handbook of Texas
Online database and within various local history publications.

4.2 Site Evaluation
Each identified archeological site was plotted on the appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map and a
scaled site map was prepared for each site. Field data were processed to evaluate site significance and
potential eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and designation as an SAL. When applicable, a variety of
data were used to assess site significance including temporal period, artifact density, artifact variety,
feature density, feature variety, feature preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and the amount of previous
disturbance.
National Register Evaluation Criteria
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria for evaluating properties for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the
authority of the NHPA, as amended (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a–d]), and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation has set forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Federal regulations indicate
that “[t]he term ‘eligible for inclusion in the National Register’ includes both properties formally
determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register

Prosper High School #2 & Off-Site Sanitary Sewer Project
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project Nos. 04.080.052 & 04.080.054
Page 17

listing criteria” (36 CFR §800.2[e]). Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any cultural resource that is
included in or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP is a historic property.
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, four criteria
for eligibility are applied. The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess
integrity of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
Criterion A:
Criterion B:
Criterion C:

Criterion D:

that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history [36 CFR Part 60.4(a–d)].

The principal objective is to determine whether a cultural resource possesses the potential to contribute to
one or more of the above-defined criteria. Adequate information regarding site function, context, and
chronological placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential
for cultural resources investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal
period, and project design, determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural
resources is a particularly important objective during the inventory and evaluation processes. Criterion D
is generally associated with prehistoric, but also historic-era, archeological sites. Criteria A, B, and C
typically reflect association with historic-era resources, rarely with prehistoric sites. The objective of the
current project was to locate and define both the horizontal and vertical extents of any cultural resources,
document and describe those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for
NRHP eligibility.
State Antiquities Landmark Evaluation Criteria
For purposes of implementing the ACT, the THC is the statutorily created body responsible for protecting
and preserving SALs (9 TNRC 191). A SAL is an archeological site, archeological collection, ruin,
building, structure, cultural landscape, site, engineering feature, monument or other object, or district that
is eligible to be designated as a landmark or is already officially designated as a landmark. The State of
Texas considers all publicly-owned archeological sites and historic buildings and structures to have some
intrinsic historic value, and the ACT provides some level of protection for those sites, buildings, or
structures regardless of their size, character, or ability to currently yield data that will contribute important
information on the history or prehistory of Texas. Additionally, these publicly-owned archeological sites
and historic buildings and structures are protected from vandalism, or other actions meant to take, alter, or
destroy them, and information directly related to the specific location of archeological sites is restricted
from open records requests. However, not all cultural resources are equally significant to the history and
prehistory of Texas. Some archeological sites may not possess research value sufficient to warrant longterm preservation or investigations beyond survey level documentation, and some historic buildings and
structures retain minimal integrity due to damage or deterioration. Therefore, the issue of whether
cultural resources are significant and warrant preservation, and/or further research (such as archeological
testing and data recovery level investigations), is addressed through official landmark designation, permit
issuance, and rules associated with enforcement of the ACT. Archeological sites and historic buildings
and structures on lands belonging to state agencies or political subdivisions of the state of Texas are
eligible to be designated as landmarks (9 TNRC 191.091 and 191.092). Also protected, under 9 TNRC
191.094, are specially designated landmarks on private property.

Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project Nos. 04.080.052 & 04.080.054
Page 18

Under the ACT at the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL. The THC uses one or more of the following criteria when assessing the
appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the ACT
permit process:
Criterion 1:
Criterion 2:
Criterion 3:
Criterion 4:
Criterion 5:

the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
the site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively,
further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting
when the site cannot be protected (13 TAC 26.10).

Buildings, structures, cultural landscapes, and non-archeological sites, objects, and districts may be
designated as landmarks provided that the following conditions are met:
Condition 1: the property fits within at least one of the following criteria:
(a) the property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
(b) the property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
(c) the property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic value, or represents
a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinctions
(d) the property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history;
Condition 2: the property retains integrity at the time of the nomination, as determined by the executive
director of the commission; and
Condition 3: for buildings and structures only, the property must be listed in the NRHP, either
individually, or as a contributing property within a historic district as determined by the
Keeper of the National Register or the executive director of the commission (13 TAC 26.19).

4.3 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation were included in the curation package. All field-generated documents were temporarily
curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and photographs were
organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
Background and archival research conducted in preparation for this cultural resources survey indicated
that at least eight prior cultural resources investigations have taken place within 1 mi (1.6 km) of the
proposed APE, resulting in the documentation of one previously recorded archeological site in the
vicinity of the APE. During this survey, the direct APE was subjected to reconnaissance survey transects
and a systematic intensive survey. Pedestrian reconnaissance was conducted across the entire APE to
confirm the extent of prior ground disturbances and assess the likelihood of encountering cultural
resources. Ground surface visibility was highly variable and irregular across the APE, ranging from 0 to
100 percent. Intensive survey with systematic shovel test sampling in staggered intervals was conducted
across the portions of the APE with the potential to contain archeological resources. During this survey,
three new historic-period archeological sites (41COL305, 41COL310, and 41COL311) were documented
within the APE. Archival research and deed/title chains were conducted to evaluate the historic-period
sites and site components. A photograph location map and representative survey photographs are
presented in Appendix A and a site location map is presented in Appendix B.

5.1 Archeological Survey
General Survey Observations
High School #2 Location APE
The proposed Prosper High School #2 APE encompasses an upland setting dissected by an unnamed
tributary of Parvin Branch (Appendix A, Photographs 01 and 02). Field investigations verified the
disturbances depicted in historical aerial photographs and documented that portions of the APE have been
exposed to various forms of ground disturbance that would have affected near-surface archeological
deposits. Several drainage features have caused soil erosion and deflation within portions of the proposed
school site APE. However, the most widespread and significant past disturbance is related to prolonged
plowing and cultivation of most of the proposed school site APE. Historical aerial photographs indicate
the agricultural or pastoral land use has persisted since 1952 and presumably for much of the late 19th and
20th century. More recent ground disturbances, including grading, soil stockpiling, and a buried highpressure natural gas pipeline were also observed within the proposed school site APE (Appendix A,
Photographs 03 through 06).
Off-Site Sanitary Sewer Interceptor Pipeline APE
The proposed off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline APE extends along the undulating, dissected
uplands along Parvin Branch and an unnamed tributary (Appendix A, Photographs 07 and 08). The
APE crosses the channel at several locations along the proposed corridor (e.g., Appendix A,
Photographs 09 and 10). Surface soils within upland portions of the APE were observed to be heavily
deflated. Soil and aggregate quarrying and stockpiling have taken place adjacent to the central portion of
the APE, which coincides with the underlying geological contact between the Eagle Ford and Austin
Chalk formations. This has resulted in extensive disturbance within and adjacent to the APE, including
the deposition of fill and a large culvert across Parvin Branch (Appendix A, Photographs 11 and 12).
The proposed Prosper ISD off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline will intercept the existing sanitary
sewer pipeline at the western terminus of the APE (Appendix A, Photograph 13).
Pedestrian Reconnaissance and Intensive Survey
Pedestrian reconnaissance survey was conducted across the entire proposed APE and was augmented
within HPA and other areas with the potential to contain cultural resources by intensive survey via shovel
testing. With few exceptions, the intensive survey transpired only within HPA. However, 100 percent of
the APE was assessed through pedestrian reconnaissance transect survey. Areas previously impacted by
significant ground disturbances were assessed through reconnaissance survey to determine the potential
Prosper High School #2 & Off-Site Sanitary Sewer Project
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project Nos. 04.080.052 & 04.080.054

for intact archeological deposits. Due to the contrasting topographic setting present across the APE, soil
profiles exposed in shovel tests and stream banks exhibited variable characteristics.
High School #2 Location APE
Within the proposed high school site APE, pedestrian survey transects were spaced at 30-m intervals.
Twenty-seven shovel tests were excavated within the 47-ac HPA portion of APE (Figure 5.1). An
additional two shovel tests were excavated outside the HPA to confirm the nature of the soils across the
landform. Shovel testing within the APE revealed a predominant soil type containing a dark grayish
brown clay or clay loam (10YR 2/1 and 10YR 3/1) across much of the APE. Extensive previous
disturbance was noted and documented across the APE. Saturated and inundated soils were also present
along the unnamed tributary of Parvin Branch that extends across the southwestern corner of the APE.
An early 20th century surface artifact scatter was documented around a circa 1940s house located in the
northern portion of the easternmost HPA. Historic-period archeological site 41COL305 was documented
within the extent of the associated artifacts, surface features, and architectural resources. The house at
that location (16028 Coit Road) and the associated barn were documented as historic-age architectural
resources (Appendix A, Photographs 14 and 15; see Section 5.4). A modern house (15828 Coit Road)
was observed within the southern half of the easternmost HPA (Appendix A, Photographs 16 and 17).
According to the Collin County Appraisal District, the brick two-story house was built in 1987 and
therefore was not documented.
Within the western HPA, a brick-lined well was situated near the unnamed tributary (Appendix A,
Photographs 18 and 19). A series of recent aerial imagery sources depict a windmill associated with the
well at this location from 1995 until September 2017. The windmill appears to have been demolished
shortly before this survey with only one support remaining. The well was constructed with bricks, some
of which bear manufacturing marks and logos. Marks observed on the brick comprising the well include
“ATLAS” (Atlas Press Brick Works [1895 to 1918]), “GLOBE” (Globe Press Brick Company [1904 to
1923]), and with a single, five-pointed star logo (Lone Star Press Brick Company [1905 to 1923]). No
well, windmill, or associated structure are evident on earlier aerial photographs. A vast quantity of
modern building materials, hardware, and refuse, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and electrical
conduit and wiring, were observed within and immediately surrounding the well. A buried high-pressure
natural gas pipeline right-of way (ROW) is also located adjacent to the well. Although the well was
constructed with early 20th century bricks, modern PVC pipe and electrical conduit hardware, the method
and condition of concrete joining, the presence of the adjacent pipeline corridor, and a review of historic
aerial photography indicate that the well was either constructed more recently from repurposed materials
or has been extensively disturbed and reconstructed.
Off-Site Sanitary Sewer APE
Within the off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline APE, this survey consisted of single and multiple
transect survey methods. Portions of the off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline APE that comprised a
corridor width of 100 ft or less were surveyed with a single pedestrian survey transect, with shovel tests
excavated in 100-m intervals within HPA. Portions of the off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline
APE with a proposed corridor width greater than 100 ft were assessed using two pedestrian survey
transects with shovel tests excavated in 100-m staggered intervals within HPA. Thirty-nine shovel tests
were excavated within the off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline APE (Figure 5.2). Soils
encountered within the APE varied from dark grayish brown clay or clay loam (10YR 2/1 and 10YR 3/1)
within the Parvin Branch valley to yellowish-brown (10YR 4/2) silty loam or gravelly silty clay loam
within adjacent upland locations. Two historic-period archeological sites (41COL310 and 41COL311)
were documented within the extent of early 20th century surface artifact scatters during this survey of the
proposed off-site sanitary sewer pipeline APE.

5.2 Encountered Cultural Resources
Site 41COL305
Site 41COL305 is a newly recorded historic-period archeological site located within the eastern half of
the proposed High School #2 APE. Topographically, the site is situated near the summit of an interfluvial
upland that separates Rutherford Branch and an unnamed tributary of Parvin Branch. During the IES
survey, site 41COL305 was documented within an area extending approximately 230 ft (70 m) east-towest by 214 ft (65 m) north-to-south (Appendix A, Photograph 20). The site was delineated within the
distribution of historic-period surface artifact scatters, negative shovel test locations, and observed
disturbances (Figure 5.3).
Disturbances
Prior to the field survey, background research determined that a structure was present at this location as
early as 1930. The General Highway Map of Collin County dating to 1939 indicates the structure was a
barn in use at the time. The barn structure along with a residential building was visually confirmed
through historical aerial photographs from 1952. USGS topographic maps from 1961 to 1982 illustrate
one residential building and two barn structures. As depicted in aerial photography, much of the property
in proximity to the site was used for pastoral or agricultural purposes. This land use has continued until
the time of field investigations.
Intensive Survey Observations
During site delineation, IES investigators excavated six negative shovel tests. Ground visibility during
the survey ranged from 10 to 15 percent with the greatest visibility along fence lines. Investigators
observed three small surficial scatters of glass shards, ceramic sherds, and construction materials within
the limits of the site. The densest artifact scatter occurred along the southern limits of the site near the
house and associated storm cellar (see Section 5.3.1). The observed scatter consisted of sherds of
stoneware vessels, whiteware, clear glass shards, amber glass fragments, and pieces of a white glass
cosmetic jar lid (Appendix A, Photographs 21 and 22). The scatter also yielded a shard of solarized
pressed glass, which generally dates from 1890 to 1920. These artifacts were concentrated along a 50-ft
section of fence line between the entrance to the storm cellar and the eastern edge of the backyard. A
similar artifact scatter of whiteware sherds, clear glass, and aqua glass was observed near the northern
boundary of the site in between a fence line and row of trees. In the northwest corner of the site, a diffuse
scatter of construction debris was observed. The scatter was characterized by bricks, corrugated metal
sheeting, plastic and metal piping, lumber, concrete chunks, and scrap metal. Although the majority of
bricks observed were unmarked, a few bricks were stamped with either a single, five-point star logo
(Lone Star Press Brick Company; 1905 to 1923) or “FLOMEX”. No information was found regarding
the manufacturer of the FLOMEX bricks, other than it was likely a foreign import (presumably from
Mexico).
Shovel testing revealed soils of dark grayish-black clay (10YR 2/1 or 2/2) to a depth of approximately 30
cmbs. Shovel test AG3, located in the backyard of the house, differed from other shovel tests with a layer
of medium brown sandy loam to a depth of 30 cmbs and was underlain by very dark brown, compact clay
(10YR 2/1) that featured few inclusions. The unique nature of AG3 within the context of the site might
be attributable to past disturbances from installation of utilities for the house, continual recreational use of
the backyard, or construction of storage sheds near the western boundary of the site.
Shovel testing was limited to areas that were accessible with minimal disturbance. A temporary gravel
access road was installed along the northern boundary of the site prior to the IES survey. In addition, no
shovel tests were excavated near the eastern part of the site due to hazardous material removal from the
house at the time of the survey.

Based on these records, historical aerial photographs, and artifacts observed on the surface, the
historic-period occupation of the site most likely pertains to the Carrell family ownership. None of the
names presented within the chain of title were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online or other referenced
regional historical documents.
Site Summary
Site 41COL305 is a newly recorded historic-period archeological site associated with an early 20th
century farmstead. The site contained three low density artifact scatters primarily located along fence
lines surrounding the domestic residential and general barnyard area. In the vicinity of the house and
barn, a total of six shovel tests were excavated, none of which yielded cultural materials.
Site 41COL310
Site 41COL310 is a historic-period archeological site located within the off-site sanitary sewer interceptor
pipeline APE. The site pertains to a brick-lined water well feature and an associated early 20th century
surface artifact scatter and was delineated within the extent of surface artifacts associated with the well
feature (Appendix A, Photograph 23) . The site measures approximately 150 ft (46 m) north-to-south
by 90 ft (27 m) east-to-west within the APE and occupies an upland terrace above Parvin Branch at an
elevation of 690 to 705 ft (210 to 215 m) amsl (Figure 5.4).
Disturbances
Prior to the field survey, background research determined that no buildings or structures were located in
the vicinity of the site. As depicted in aerial photography, much of the land within proximity to the site
was used for pastoral or agricultural purposes. Prior to 1952, fields east and south of the site were
extensively terraced and a small stock pond adjacent to the eastern boundary of the site was created by the
construction of an earthen berm across a tributary of Parvin Branch.
Shovel Testing and Observations
Due to APE and topographic restrictions, as well as surficial nature of the site, IES investigators
excavated only four shovel tests at site 41COL310. All shovel tests were negative and revealed a surface
layer of dark grayish-brown (10YR 3/1) clay loam to a depth of approximately 30 cmbs. The site
contained a low-density ephemeral artifact scatter that was concentrated within an erosional gully in the
southeastern portion of the site. The artifact scatter consisted of colorless glass bottles, aqua glass, cobalt
glass, whiteware, a ceramic sherd with dark brown and white glazes, brick fragments, and miscellaneous
scrap metal. The 11 glass bottles or glass bottle fragments yielded the most valuable information for
dating this part of the site. Six of the bottles indicated manufacture dates in the 1920s and 1930s (Table
5.2).
Site Features
A brick-lined water well was located approximately 70 ft (21 m) northwest of the artifact scatter
(Appendix A, Photograph 24). The well measured approximately 58 in (147 cm) in diameter and 25 in
(63 cm) in height above the ground surface. The well extended at least 10 ft (3 m) in depth to the water
table. Construction of the well appears to have been inconsistent, as the sides of the well are not
cylindrical below ground surface. Visible walls of the feature were constructed of rectangular brick and
mortar. The use of rectangular bricks instead of trapezoidal bricks may have led to the well’s irregular
form. The exterior of the wall above the surface was covered in cement to prevent cracks and weathering
of the brick masonry. A few exposed bricks showed the “ACME FERRIS” mark. The bricks were
manufactured by the Acme Brick Company of Ferris, Texas, which operated from 1934 to 1970.

The site is located on a 123.16-ac property within the Collin County School Land survey, Abstract 155,
which was patented on 17 January 1862, and the Thomas J. Jamison survey, Abstract 481, patented on 11
April 1854. Prior to 1980, the site was associated with two different parcels with separate ownership
histories. Using public deed records from the Collin County Clerk’s Office, chains of title for the eastern
and western parcels were generated (Tables 5.3 and 5.4).

Based on these records and artifacts observed, the eastern part of the site most likely pertains to the Black
or Hambleton-Frahm families and the water well feature in the western part of the site likely pertains to
the Parvin or Wysong family ownerships. Despite different owners, it is unclear if the scatter and well
feature are related or exclusive to the history of each parcel. None of the names presented within the
chain of title were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online or other referenced historical documents.
Site Summary
Site 41COL310 is a newly recorded historic-period archeological site containing an ephemeral early 20th
century surface artifact scatter and a brick lined water well. Diagnostic glass bottles indicate the eastern
part of the site dates to the 1920s or 1930s. Based on brick markings, the water well feature appears to
have been constructed between 1934 and 1970. Due to restrictions of the APE and topography, only four
shovel tests were excavated, none of which contained cultural deposits.
Site 41COL311
Site 41COL311 is a newly recorded historic-period archeological site documented within the eastern
portion of the sanitary sewer APE. The site was situated on an upland terrace adjacent to the confluence
of Parvin Branch and an unnamed tributary at an elevation of 715 to 725 ft (218 to 221 m) amsl
(Appendix A, Photograph 25). The site measured approximately 87 ft (26 m) east-to-west by 30 ft (10
m) north-to-south within the APE and was defined by a sparse exposure of early 20th century surface
artifacts (Figure 5.5).
Disturbances
Prior to the field survey, background research determined that a structure was present approximately 900
ft (275 m) south of this location as early as 1930; however, the structure is not indicated in the 1939
General Highway map or the 1940 Census Enumeration District map. The structure was confirmed to
have been demolished prior to 1968 through a review of historical aerial photographs. As depicted in
aerial photography, much of the land in proximity to the site was used for pastoral or agricultural

purposes. This land use has continued until the time of field investigations. The gently sloping uplands
exhibit numerous areas of soil erosion and exposed regolith, resulting in the exposure of artifacts.
Intensive Survey Observations
The surface artifact scatter observed at the site consisted of shards of solarized glass, a porcelain sherd,
clear glass bottle base, and a marked brick. Solarized or sun purpled glass is a result of exposure of
manganese in the glass, which was added during production to create colorless glass, to sunlight or other
forms of ultraviolet rays. This type of glass generally dates between 1890 and 1920, although there are
some rare examples of glass dating earlier or later than this timeframe. The clear glass bottle base had a
‘H over A’ maker’s mark, indicating the bottle was produced by the Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. between 1923
and 1982 when this particular logo was used. In addition to the diagnostic glass fragments, a marked
brick was identified. The light-colored brick was manufactured by Laclede-Christy Clay Products Co. of
Missouri as indicated by the marking of “Laclede St. Louis.” The company operated from 1907 to around
1930. The scatter extended outside of the APE and included aqua bottle glass, clear bottle glass, wrought
iron, scrap metal, and a variety of pink, yellow, and green pressed glass shards.
During site delineation, IES investigators excavated a shovel test (CG55), which did not yield any cultural
materials. Shovel testing revealed a grayish-brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly silty loam surface layer. Regolith
was encountered at a depth of approximately 40 cmbs. The artifact scatter was exposed across a deflated
upland slope surface with exposures of regolith. Due to the widespread erosion and ground surface
visibility at the site, additional shovel testing was deemed unnecessary.
Archival Research
The site is located on a 292-ac property within the Collin County School Land #11 survey, Abstract 155,
which was patented on 17 January 1862. Using public deed records from the Collin County Clerk’s
Office, a chain of title for the property encompassing the historic-period site was generated (Table 5.5).
Based on these records, historical aerial photographs, and artifacts observed on the surface, the
historic-period site most likely pertains to the Newsome family ownership. Edwin A. Newsome was the
son of Isaac D. Newsome, one of the first merchants in the City of McKinney. Edwin and his brother
William B. Newsome, board chairman and federal reserve agent for the Dallas Federal Bank, continued
the mercantile business after their father’s death as well as several other enterprises. According to his
obituary, Edwin Newsome was one of the wealthiest residents of the county (Find A Grave 2018). He
served as a director for the Texas Cotton Mill in McKinney, which his brother helped develop, and as a
director for the Collin County National Bank.
Edwin A. Newsom built and lived in a large, grand Victorian-style house at 511 West Virginia Street in
McKinney with wife and two sons. A history of the house provided with the Historic Resource Inventory
Survey (HRIS) interactive map (HRIS 2018) briefly mentions that Mr. Newsom tended a farm; however,
no additional information about the location of this farm could be located. Although the property was
owned by Edwin Newsom and his heirs, the Newsome family had an extensive number of landholdings in
Collin County. Like many other prominent families in North Texas with ownership of multiple
properties, the Newsome may have leased the property to local farmers or ranchers.
Site Summary
Site 41COL311 is a newly recorded historic-period archeological site containing a low-density domestic
artifact scatter. The observed assemblage consisted of solarized glass, porcelain, and clear bottle glass.
Based on diagnostic artifacts present, the site dates to the early 20th century. The locally famous
Newsome family owned the property during this period; however, it is uncertain if the site is directly
associated with the Newsome family or a tenant.

5.3 Archeological Isolates
During the pedestrian survey of the off-site sanitary sewer interceptor pipeline APE, three isolated
historic-period artifacts were observed within the channel of Parvin Branch. The base of an amber glass
bottle, bearing the Owens-Illinois Glass Company “I within an O” logo (post-1954), a “FLOMEX”marked brick, and a Lone Star Press Brick Company (1905 to 1923) brick were observed on a gravel bar
with the active channel of Parvin Branch.

5.4 Architectural Resource Assessment
During the IES survey, five buildings and structures were identified that were grouped into two
architectural resources (ARs) within the direct APE (Figure 5.6). Each resource is summarized based on
property composition and architectural characteristics (Table 5.6).
AR-1
AR-1 is a historic-age residential dwelling located at 16028 Coit Road. The building measures
approximately 55 ft by 40 ft (16 m by 12 m). The building is an asymmetrical, single story, folk style,
cross gabled, wood framed house with flush horizontal board siding, and appears to have a room addition
on the rear side of the structure (Appendix A, Photographs 26 through 29). The asymmetrical façade,
especially the roof lines, contain stylistic features seen in the Craftsman style of the early 20th century. A
unique feature of the house is the hipped joint of the roof towards the rear of the structure, which indicates
a later room addition. According to the property’s chain of title (see Table 5.1), the house was built
under the ownership of the Carrell family.

A storm cellar is located near the southwest corner of the house. The cellar is constructed of cast concrete
with wooden doors leading to a descending set of concrete stairs to an unknown depth (Appendix A,
Photograph 30). Northwest of the house were two sheds or storage rooms. These structures consisted of
corrugated metal sheeting covering a wood frame (Appendix A, Photographs 31 and 32). An inspection
of the hardware and lumber used revealed the structures were of modern age.
AR-2
AR-2 is a historic-age barn located 250 ft (75 m) west of AR-1. The building measured 43 ft by 35 ft (13
m by 11 m) with a covered shed extension addition measuring 22 ft by 35 ft (7 m by 10 m) extending off
of the eastern wall. The two-story, rectangular barn features a wood frame with vertical board siding
painted red, a front-gabled roof covered in metal sheeting, a second story hay loft with shuttered
windows/openings, large sliding doors on north side, and a covered shed extention added to the building
between 1995 and 2001 (Appendix A, Photographs 33 through 36). Sections of the exterior wall on the
south side are missing. The interior of the barn contains several animal stalls composed of horizontal
boards. The feeding area on the west side of the barn features a wall composed of long, wide milled
lumber.
The construction date of the building is unknown, but information collected during the background
review indicates the barn was built before 1930. Based on historical records and observed architectural
features, the barn dates to the late 19th or early 20th century. See Table 5.1 for the chain of title for the
property.

5.5 Indirect APE Assessment
To satisfy NHPA requirements, visual impacts were assessed. Historical maps and modern aerial
photographs indicated the indirect APE around the proposed Prosper High School #2 direct APE was void
of historic-aged standing buildings or structures. Since no elements of the proposed off-site sanitary
sewer interceptor project will remain above ground, visual impacts are not anticipated from the proposed
undertaking.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During this survey, 67 shovel tests were excavated within the 129-acre APE. Three newly recorded
historic-period archeological sites (41COL305, 41COL310, 41COL311) and two historic-age
architectural resources (AR-1 and AR-2) were documented during the survey.

-

41COL305 is a newly recorded historic-period archeological site associated with an early 20th century
farmstead. During the IES investigation, pedestrian survey and shovel testing within the site
encountered a low-density surface accumulation of early 20th century domestic artifacts. Based on the
site’s lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s) and the low potential to
yield significant archeological data, site 41COL305 is recommended not eligible for listing on the
NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D or designation as an SAL. No further work is recommended for this
site.
41COL310 is a newly recorded historic-period archeological site comprising a low-density surface
artifact scatter and brick-lined water well feature. During the survey, IES investigators encountered
early 20th century domestic artifacts and a brick-lined water well feature constructed sometime during
the early or mid-20th century. Based on the site’s lack of association with a significant historical
event(s) or person(s) and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the portion of site
41COL310 documented within the APE is recommended not eligible for listing on the NRHP under
Criteria A, B, or D or designation as an SAL. No further work is recommended for this site within
the APE.
41COL311 is a newly recorded historic-period archeological site comprising a low-density surface
artifact scatter. During IES investigations, the site was documented as a surface accumulation of
primarily early 20th century domestic artifacts. Based on the site’s lack of association with a
significant historical event(s) or person(s) and the low potential to yield significant archeological
data, the portion of site 41COL311 documented within the APE is recommended not eligible for
listing on the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D or designation as an SAL. No further work is
recommended for this site within the APE.
AR-1 is a single story, folk style house constructed in the 1940s. Although the house retains original
integrity and is over 50 years old, AR-1 is recommended not eligible for listing on the NRHP under
all criteria; nor should it be considered for SAL designation.
AR-2 is a two-story barn dating to the late 19th or early 20th century. Based on a lack of integrity, AR-2 is
recommended not eligible for listing on the NRHP under all criteria, nor should it be considered for
SAL designation.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the Prosper ISD High School #2 and off-site sanitary
sewer interceptor pipeline project be permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resources
investigations. However, if any cultural resources, other than those detailed within this report, are
encountered during construction, the operators should immediately stop construction activities in those
areas. The project environmental consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with
the THC/SHPO prior to resuming construction activities.
