Tents for Tots Grant
From M. K. Brown Foundation Provides
Shade Tents for Youth Group
By Douglas K. Boyd
For many years, one of the hassles I faced before each
field school was trying to round enough shade tents for
the youth group. Thanks to the M. K. Brown Foundation,
the Panhandle Archeological Society, and the Courson
Archeological Projects, this hassle has been permanently
eliminated and the youth group now has four new 10x20-ft
shade tarps that will last for many years. Many panhandle
people are due thanks for their role in what affectionately
became known as the “Tents for Tots” project.
Scott Brosowske and Danny Witt, with the Courson
Archeological Projects in Perrtyon, did the initial research and found the hardware for suitable shade structures—ones that would stand up to panhandle winds—at
Party Tent City in Houston. TAS field school camp boss
Bob Smith (Stinnett) then approached the Panhandle
Archeological Society for assistance, and various PAS
members took it from there. Then PAS president Joe
Rogers (Hereford) wrote a grant proposal, and Richard
Mackie (Pampa) took the proposal to the M. K. Brown
Foundation of Pampa. The Brown Foundation then approved $1,000 in funds for the project. Rolla Shaller
(Amarillo) ordered the hardware for four shelters, without
the conduit poles, and had it all shipped from Houston.
He and Alvin Lynn (Amarillo) then purchased 80 10-ft
sections of 1-inch conduit from Lowes Home Improvement Warehouse, and they gave the PAS a 20% discount.
Rolla and Alvin then spent many hours cutting the poles
into various sizes to fit the frames, while Alvin’s wife,
Nadyne, provided cold drinks and moral support for the
dynamic duo. They even color coded the shelter parts to
make them easier to put together! Lisa Jackson (Canyon)

detailed written assembly instructions that were, I must
say, mighty handy. And finally, the Courson Archeological Projects supplied the stakes and ropes that tethered
the shelters to Texas soil and kept them from ending up
in the Oklahoma panhandle.
The total cost for the new youth group shade shelters
was $1,300. Thanks to chairman Leland W. Waters and the
M. K. Brown Foundation for the $1000 grant and to President Wayne Benson and the Panhandle Archeological Society for providing the additional $300. My hat is off to all
of the wonderful folks who helped make this happen… and
my neck isn’t sunburned because we always had shade!

TAS member Annie Salinas Wins 2nd Place
at National History Day Competition with
Exhibit on San Sabá Mission
By Douglas K. Boyd
I remember that Annie Salinas asked a lot of questions
during the 2007 field school held at Presidio San Sabá in Menard, Texas. That summer Annie was attending her second field
school. The seventh grade home school student from Spring,
Texas, was a bright and inquisitive young lady, and she proved
to be a very capable archeologist. She spent several days working carefully to help expose and document a rock wall and
cobblestone pavement in a 4x4-m block, and she did a superb

job. Annie wanted to know everything about Spanish history
and the historical archeology we were doing. I answered her
questions as best I could, but soon found her asking questions
that were reaching the limits of my knowledge. I was definitely
impressed by Annie, but at the time I had no way of knowing where this interest might lead her. As it turned out, the
field school at Menard was only the beginning of this young
scholar’s investigations into Spanish Colonial history.
According to Annie’s mother, Lisa Salinas, Annie was
developing an interest in archeology before she attended her
first TAS field school at the Stallings Ranch in 2006. She was
especially excited to participate in the 2007 field school work
at Presidio San Sabá because they discovered the family has
a direct connection to the history there. Before going to the
field school, Annie found out she was related to Jual Leal, the
Spanish soldier who led the survivors of the 1758 Indian attack on Mission San Sabá across the river and to safety at the
presidio. Armed with this knowledge, Annie took a personal
interest in Spanish Colonial history and the story of the mission and presidio at San Sabá.
After her TAS experience at San Sabá, Annie continued
her Spanish Colonial research and decided to create an historical exhibit for National History Day­­an academic organization
that exists to promote history education for junior high and
high school students. As stated on the National History Day
website (www.nationalhistoryday.org), they seek to teach
students in five areas:
• critical thinking and problem-solving skills
• research and reading skills
• oral and written communication and presentation skills
• self esteem and confidence
• a sense of responsibility for and involvement in the
democratic process

The main program sponsored by this organization is
the National History Day contest. Students in grades 6­to 12
“engage in discovery and interpretation of historical topics
related to an annual theme.” The students create scholarly
projects in the form of exhibits, documentaries, historical

papers, performances, or web sites. The competition begins
at the district level, advances to the state, and culminates with
a national competition held each June at the University of
Maryland in College Park. Having served as a judge for the
National History Day several years ago, I know that only the
best projects make it to the state competition in Austin.
The National History Day project Annie created is called
The San Sabá Mission: Spanish Colonial Turning Point in
Texas. It is a three-panel exhibit highlighting the historical
significance of the mission that marked the end of the Spanish efforts to settle the northern frontier. The exhibit is, quite
simply, outstanding.
At the local level, Annie’s San Sabá Mission project was
awarded one of two Outstanding Regional Entry awards at
the Montgomery County regional competition. The project
went on to compete at the state level on May 3-4, 2008 at the
Bob Bullock Museum and University of Texas. Here Annie’s
exhibit received three special awards:
• The C.M. Caldwell Memorial Award for Texas History—
for the best exhibit on a topic focused on Texas history
• The Hispanic Heritage Award—for outstanding papers
and exhibits on Hispanic history, particularly Tejano
history during the 1700s and 1800s
• The Texas Old Missions and Forts Restoration Association Award—for exhibits involving missions and/or forts
in Texas
Even more exciting, Annie won second place in the Junior Division (6th-8th grade) Individual Exhibit category out
of forty-four entries that made it to state. This qualified her
to compete in the national competition to be held in College
Park, Maryland, June 15-19, 2008.
While many of us were off playing at the annual field
school in the panhandle, Annie was back east competing in
one of the nation’s toughest academic contests. Just before
going to field school, I learned about Annie’s history project
from Mark Wolf of San Antonio. Mark took a personal interest in Annie’s history project because he is also a descendant
of Juan Leal and was the one who initiated the search for the
site of the San Sabá Mission in 1993. When Mark found out
that Annie’s history project had won at the state level, he suggested that TAS should try to help out because of the many
unexpected expenses the family would incur during their
trip to the national competition. They would have to ship the
exhibit, fly to Washington, D.C., pay for hotels and travel for
the week, and pay the National History Day registration fees.

In short, Annie’s success would be very expensive! At this
point, I felt obligated to do something to help them shoulder
the costs of this trip.
On June 14, at the Saturday evening program to kick off
the 2008 field school, I talked about Annie’s history exhibit
and announced that she had won at state. I also told everyone
that Annie could not attend this year’s field school because she
was at the National History Day competition in Maryland. On
Monday night, we officially kicked off a fundraising drive.
As soon as the announcement was made, members began
giving money and donated a tool box and supplies to create
an “archeology field kit” that would be raffled. Where better to hold a raffle than at the annual field school margarita
party? Raffle tickets went on sale as soon as the party started
on Tuesday, June 17. Knowing that the proceeds were going
to help Annie, TAS members responded generously. Ticket
sales soared and more archeology supplies were donated to
enhance the value of the archeology kit. By the end of the
party, the raffle had raised $561 dollars, thus proving that TAS
members are very generous indeed—especially after one or
two of Wally’s special margaritas! TAS members continued
to make donations over the next few days, and, by the time
field school ended, the fundraising effort had netted $1080.00.
Special thanks go to all those wonderful folks who helped
make this effort so successful.
Lisa Salinas called to tell me the great news on Wednesday evening, June 18. Annie had won second place in the

Junior Individual Exhibit category. She was one of only six
students from Texas to win top honors at National History
Day—and the only one whose project was focused on an
aspect of Texas history. When I announced this to everyone
at the program the following evening, the roar from the TAS
group at Lake Fryer was so loud that it was probably heard
by people in Perryton!
TAS has long supported the youth group as an important part of its annual archeological field school, and we are
proud to offer this fun and educational opportunity to young
TAS members. In this case, however, the table is turned. It is
Annie Salinas who has provided a tremendous service to the
TAS, and we should be thanking her. Beginning with a TASinspired idea, Annie went on to create a superb exhibit and

her amazing success in the National History Day competition
draws special attention to the TAS organization. This is advertising that money can’t buy, and it highlights the educational
aspects of TAS. This free advertising will continue in the
months to come as her San Sabá Mission exhibit is displayed
in various places across the state. In July, for example, Annie
presented her project in Menard to students from around the
state participating in the Old Stories, New Voices history camp
sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and
put on by the Texas State Historical Association.
Adrian and Lisa Salinas are understandably proud of their
daughter’s accomplishments, and so are we. From all your
friends in the Texas Archeological Society, a hearty congratulations to Annie Salinas! We are all proud of you!

Two Open Letters To TAS
Dear TAS friends:
It is with great appreciation that we received the news from Doug Boyd about the generous donations that you had
made toward our daughter Annie’s trip to the National History Day competition with her historical exhibit The San Sabá
Mission: Spanish Colonial Turning Point in Texas. Her interest in the topic was sparked by her involvement in the 2007
TAS field school at San Sabá. It led to a year’s worth of research, contact with historians and archivists, and the creation
of a historical exhibit about this amazing time and place in Texas history. Annie has been enthralled with the story of San
Sabá since she first began to learn about it, and her excitement for her topic has grown as she has continued her research
and been able to widen her understanding of its impact on Spain’s hold over Texas and the Southwest.
The TAS field schools are the hands-on experiential introduction to archaeology and Texas history that students like
Annie need to begin forming a true understanding of history in general. I am thankful that we have found TAS and appreciate the incredible generosity that you have exhibited through your donations toward Annie’s historical exhibit and
her trip to National History Day. Your involvement with students like Annie has helped to encourage young people to
further their interest in archaeology and given them an important beginning toward what may be a lifelong pursuit for
many. We hope that the success of Annie’s San Sabá exhibit at both Texas History Day and National History Day will
be an inspiration to other students. We hope also that it will demonstrate the important role that TAS members play in
the lives of our young students of Texas history, particularly through summer field school.
Thank you again for your generous support of our Texas history student and budding archaeologist. We hope to be
able to thank many of you personally at future TAS events.
Lisa & Adrian Salinas
Dear TAS
Thank you very much for contributing so generously toward my trip to National History Day. It was very exciting
for me to bring the incredible story of the San Sabá Mission to so many people. Since last year’s field school, I have
been researching the history of San Sabá and the Spanish colonial period. I have learned a tremendous amount, have had
the opportunity to go many places while doing my research, and have met some wonderful people along the way. It has
been a lot of work, but it was all worthwhile. Thank you again for your donations toward my San Sabá exhibit and trip
to the national competition. I look forward to seeing you all soon at a TAS event!
