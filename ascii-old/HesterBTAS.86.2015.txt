The Discovery and Study of the Mexican War Mass Grave
at Resaca de la Palma
Thomas R. Hester

ABSTRACT
In early April 1967, a mass grave of Mexican soldiers war dead was excavated at Resaca de la Palma, the site
of the second battle of the Mexican War. The human remains, found accidentally during construction activities,
were reported to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas and three students
who worked at the laboratory were sent to the locale near Brownsville. The mass grave was excavated and
documented, and the skeletal materials and associated artifacts were returned to Austin. Over a number of
years, the human remains, along with the artifacts, were analyzed, and results appeared in a Master’s thesis
and several scientific publications. In September 2008, the soldiers’ remains and artifacts were returned to the
Mexican Government for reinterment.

INTRODUCTION
In late March 1967, Dr. Dee Ann Story, Director of The University of Texas’ Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), received a
telephone call describing the discovery of human
bones at a housing subdivision constructed by
Alton Gloor of Brownsville (Figure 1). Dredging to develop a man-made, or artificial, lake
off the south side of the Resaca de la Palma had
exposed a mass grave. Dr. Story asked three of her
students, Michael B. Collins, Thomas R. Hester,
and Thomas Ellzey, to go from Austin to Brownsville to check out the reported discovery (Hester
1978:71; Westcott et al. 2012:19). She offered a
vehicle, and a little travel and gasoline money!
This three-person team arrived at Resaca de la
Palma on April 1. The following article chronicles
the excavation, study, and subsequent reinterment
of the remains.
BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BATTLE
The Battle of Resaca de la Palma (known to
the Mexican Army as the Resaca de la Guerrero
[DePalo 1997]) was the second military encounter
of the Mexican War, occurring on May 9, 1846,
the day after the Battle of Palo Alto on May 8
(Figure 2).

Ratliff (1994) states that 5000-6000 Mexican
troops fought under General Mariano Arista, with
about 2200 American soldiers commanded by
Brigadier General Zachary Taylor. The fighting
was fierce, described as hand-to-hand combat as
the Mexican soldiers were in thick brush (chaparral) near the Rio Grande, requiring that U.S. infantry and cavalry regiments break into groups to
fight their way through the thorn brush (Figure 3).
General Zachary Taylor, in his formal report to
the Army’s adjutant general, noted that his forces
buried 200 Mexican soldiers “on the day succeeding the battle.” According to official American government documents, the troops buried 262 Mexican
dead on the battlefield. The Mexican army, however, reported 160 deaths and 228 wounded (NPS
1997:61, 63). Some citizens of Brownsville wrote
of seeing scattered bones from unburied bodies in
the battlefield area as late as 1848.
A late 20th century study of the condition
of the battlefield was done by Neil C. Mangum,
regional historian for the National Park Service.
He assembled numerous maps from the time of
the battle and located various reference points.
However, he reported that Resaca de la Palma
had been destroyed as a battlefield, with modern
houses lining the Resaca, the channel of which
has been deepened, as well as at least two ponds
that have been created in recent years (see also
Perttula 1996).

FIELDWORK: EXCAVATION
OF THE MASS GRAVE
Upon arrival at the site of the mass grave, we
met with those responsible for the construction, and
they took steps to limit access to the area. There
were a number of interested people (a view of the
daily gallery is seen in Figure 15) and at least a few
who had dug into the skeletal remains exposed in
the cut bank of the man-made lake. We were able
to photograph some of the finds that were dug up

lying atop or under other remains. And, as
we exposed the remains, it was also obvious that partial skeletons represented some
individuals. As these observations were
confirmed, we realized that the victims
from the battle had been dropped or thrown
into a large grave pit. Among the bones
were a number of bone and shell buttons,
wire collar clasps, and other items that were
part of the clothing on the bodies at the
time of burial (e.g., Figure 7). Further, we
exposed the crumbling remnants of at least
two “canteens,” and perhaps a cartridge box
of wood and metal.
For a bit of flavor of the hectic pace of
the excavations, some excerpts from my
field notes follow:

We also noticed that the bones
and skulls bore signs indicative of
battle wounds (impacted musket balls,
and cuts made by sabers and knives).
Westcott et al. (2012:18) claims that
58 percent of the Mexican soldiers
had “unhealed, battle-related injuries.”
ARTIFACTS WITH
THE BURIALS

Certainly the most comprehensive
list of artifacts discovered among the
burials is found in Ratliff (1993:Appendix 3). Some of the decayed objects observed in the field could not
be collected (canteen; cartridge box).
The most numerous of the artifacts
were, of course, bone buttons from
clothing and uniforms. Most are of
bone (124 specimens, with four or
five holes), some of metal (n=9), and
even a few of shell (n=7). Copper eyehooks, typically found at the collars
of shirts, numbered about 18, and the
clasps that fit into the hooks included
14 specimens. There were small metal
buckles of the type that might have
been on straps for canteens or for
cartridge boxes. The badly decayed

Ratliff (1993, 1994) carried out a comprehensive analysis of the Resaca de la Palma burials for
his Master’s thesis at The University of Texas at
Austin. He first re-inventoried the remains, and
then proceeded to try to determine the age of each
individual at the time of death. He also looked
closely at the sex of each individual, and estimated
the range in stature. Ratliff went further in depth

“primary burials” that he could document through
the field notes and his analysis. As noted earlier

Hester—The Discovery and Study of the Mexican War Mass Grave at Resaca de la Palma 245
in this article, most of the burials were partial or
incomplete and/or commingled with the remains of
other soldiers. He felt that at least four individuals
were women (soldaderas).
Subsequently, Diane Wilson re-examined the
possible female burials at Resaca de la Palma. Her
conclusions (notes to Hester) were that these determinations of sex were in error. She identified one of
the burials (later shown to be unrelated to the collection) to be “probable male,” another (Burial 3)
as “probable male,” one definitely as male (Burial
11), and Burial 10 as “sex indeterminate.”
Ratliff (1994:201) also noted the “lack of
combat trauma,” but see Wescott et al. (2012) for
a very different view. He did note the frequency
of fractures, torn ligaments, and generally rough
condition of the feet. Much of the latter is probably
related to pre-Army farm or ranch life of soldiers,
perhaps aggravated by military service. Examples
of knee injuries, a fractured (healed) mandible, and
miscellaneous pre-Battle pathologies may derive
from horse kicks, personal disputes, or simply accidents (Ratliff 1994:203).
In 2012, Wescott and colleagues published a
detailed study of the battle-related injuries observed
on the remains from the mass grave. Their analysis
pointed to the presence of 27-36 individuals (in
contrast to Wesolowsky’s estimate of 30, and
Ratliff’s 31). A burial identified as possibly female
by Ratliff (1993) was found to be from a different

archeological site and had been placed in error with
the Resaca de la Palma group. It was determined
that projectiles (musket balls) were the most
common cause of death, as seen for possibly 12 of
the individuals. Cuts or “sharp-edged trauma” was
seen on some skeletons (Wescott et al. 2012:11), and
impact of blunt objects was noted on two. Overall,
58 percent of the individuals analyzed exhibited
battle-linked wounds. The wounds related to sword
and saber cuts reflect the hand-to-hand combat that
typified the battle.
STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE ANALYSIS:
GLIMPSES AT DIET
In the early 1990s, the late Jeffrey A. Huebner
(a doctoral student who worked with the author at
The University of Texas at Austin) began a program
of research involving stable carbon isotope ratio
analysis to study human and animal diets. Numerous
publications resulted. As part of his project, Huebner
sampled small pieces of bones from six Resaca de la
Palma burials. The actual laboratory work was done
by Krueger Enterprises, Inc., a division of Geochron
Laboratories, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Results
were reported to Huebner in November 1993. The
studies were funded by a grant to Hester from the
Advanced Research Program of the Texas Higher
Education Coordinating Board.

Jones (2009) published a stable carbon isotope
study on the Resaca de la Palma remains—a study
that could not have been done without her use of
Huebner’s data, with curiously slight attribution,
found in the TARL records. Data for one sample
of skeletal remains could not be confirmed, and so
the results for five individuals were used. Similar
to Huebner’s original interpretations of the mass
grave stable isotope data, Jones (2009:142) reported that each of the five soldiers represent “maize
dependent populations” and that four of these had
“freshwater or marines resources” also represented
in terms of diet.
WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH
THE BONES?: 1970-2008
According to the late Curtis Tunnell, longtime
state archeologist and executive director of the Texas
Historical Commission, an official letter was sent in
the 1970s by the Commission (or the associated Texas
Antiquities Committee) to persons at the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (INAH) in Mexico
City with an offer to return the human remains and
artifacts to Mexico. The reply was that the materials
were not wanted in Mexico and that they could be
disposed of in any way they chose.
While Director of TARL at The University of
Texas at Austin, I began receiving letters related
to the reburial of the Mexican soldiers from the
mass grave at Resaca de la Palma. The requests
came from different individuals or groups, with
different goals for proposed reburial. In April
1996, Kevin R. Young, of Forest View Historical
Services (San Antonio, Texas) wrote letters to both
the Consulate General of Mexico in San Antonio
and to Governor George W. Bush. In these letters, he suggested that the “Mexican soldados and
soldaderas” found in 1967 and “still in the hands
of the University of Texas at Austin,” be returned
to the Mexican Government. In July 1996, Ruben
Arvizu of Hollywood, California, inquired about
the remains. At that time, and since, Mr. Arvizu
has been concerned about American soldiers from
the Mexican War buried in Mexico, and while he
was not asking for any sort of direct exchange (for
the Resaca de la Palma remains), he continued to
follow the matter. It was at this time that the legal
counsel for the University of Texas System (then,
Dudley Dobie, and later, Patti Ohlendorf) consulted
with me, and it was their opinion that the remains

be returned only through an official request from
the Government of Mexico.
In August 1996, the Casamata Museum of Regional History in Matamoros, Mexico, contacted
Bruce Aiken of Brownsville, then a commissioner
on the Texas Historical Commission, to request
the return of the Resaca de la Palma remains for
reinterment in Matamoros, in association with a
monument dedicated to them. Mr. Aiken brought
the request to the attention of the Texas Historical Commission; he was advised of the need for
official Mexican government involvement for the
return of the burials.
In the late 1990s, Roberto Gamboa Mascarenas, Consul General of Mexico in Austin, contacted
the author and we had numerous useful discussions
about a way in which the Resaca de la Palma skeletal material could be formally returned to Mexico.
In August 1997, he wrote to me, making a formal
request on behalf of the Republic of Mexico, for
the return of the soldiers from the mass grave.
They were to be buried with full military honors
in Mexico City. The University of Texas at Austin
legal counsel’s office felt that the letter should
come, formally, from the Government of Mexico.
Mr. Gamboa later moved to another Consulate post
in another city, and no further progress was made
on the matter.
In a summary provided by Darrell Creel in
2013, he related what transpired while he was
Director of TARL:
In the first part of 2008, the Mexican
Consul General’s Austin, Texas office contacted the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) at The University of
Texas at Austin regarding the remains of
Mexican Army soldiers from the battle of
Resaca de la Palma. The Consul General,
Rosalba Ojeda, and staff subsequently
visited TARL to view and discuss repatriation of these remains. As a result, on
July 17, 2008, the Consul General sent a
formal request to the Vice President for
Legal Affairs at the University of Texas
at Austin for repatriation of the soldiers’
remains to Mexico.
According to standard policy and procedure at TARL, the Deaccessions Committee met on September 9, 2008, to discuss
the request and voted unanimously to
deacession the remains and transfer

Hester—The Discovery and Study of the Mexican War Mass Grave at Resaca de la Palma 247
them to the Mexican Government. This
deaccession was also approved by the
Vice President for Legal Affairs at the
University of Texas at Austin. The Consul
General was promptly notified and then
began arranging for the transfer of the remains. On December 3, 2008, the Consul
General on behalf of the Mexican Government took possession of the soldiers’
remains and transferred them to Mexico
City for reinterment.

Special thanks are due to Michael Collins for
supervising the excavations and staying involved
with project research over these many years. The
late Tom Ellzey worked with us at the site, and
guarded it at night to keep away possible looters. Al
B. Wesolowsky did yeoman’s work on the processing and continuing analysis of the remains from the
mass grave, beginning in June 1967, and compiled
a vast amount of data on the physical anthropology,
now filed at TARL. Many other archeologists and
physical anthropologists worked with the human
and cultural materials, in terms of analysis and
curation; these included Dee Ann Story, Curtis
Tunnell, Darrell Creel, Laura Nightengale, Norman Bateman, Carolyn Spock, Rosario Casarez,
Eric Ratliff, Diane Wilson, Timothy K. Perttula,
and Tom Fort (Museum of South Texas, Edinburg).
I am particularly grateful to Ruben Arvizu, of
Atlanta, Georgia, for encouraging me to write this
“first hand” account of Resaca de la Palma. His
concern for the history of the Mexican War has
impressed me since he first contacted me in the
mid-1990s.
