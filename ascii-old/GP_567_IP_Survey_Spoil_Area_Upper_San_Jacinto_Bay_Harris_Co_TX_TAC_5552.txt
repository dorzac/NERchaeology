ABSTRACT
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, oversaw cultural resources surveys for a 1.6hectare (4.0-acre) parcel of land and the adjacent 1.1 hectares (2.8) acres of submerged land of
the Upper San Jacinto Bay. The submerged land is proposed for dredging and the land for
dredge placement. The land is private property and the submerged land is owned by the Port
of Houston Authority. The Port of Houston is a political subdivision of the State of Texas and
all submerged land fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state
standards (the Antiquities Code of Texas 13 TAC 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit Number
5552 issued by the Texas Historical Commission in February 17 of 2010.
Both land and submerged land surveys were conducted in order to comply with United States
Army Corps of Engineers permitting requirements associated with wetlands that may be
impacted during construction in the project area. The procedures to be followed by the United
States Army Corps of Engineers to fulfill the requirements set forth in the National Historic
Preservation Act, other applicable historic preservation laws, and Presidential directives as
they relate to the regulatory program of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (33 CFR
Parts 320-334) are articulated in the Regulatory Program of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Part 325 - Processing of Department of the Army Permits, Appendix C Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties.
Field investigations consisted of 100% pedestrian survey and remote sensing survey of the
submerged land. The 100% pedestrian survey included systematic surface inspection
employing 30-meter (100-foot) spaced transects across the entire property and judgmental
shovel testing. Two site, Sites 41TV71 and 41TV162, are located just east of the area of
potential effects at the shoreline. To test if similar sites may exist on the shoreline of the area
of potential effects, shovel tests were spaced at 15-meter (49-foot) intervals along a transect.
No tests were positive. Based on the negative findings and background research no further
work is warranted for the land part of the area of potential effects.
Dolan Research performed magnetometer and side-scanning sonar remote sensing survey of
the submerged land in the area of potential effects. The results were negative for any sites,
features, or unexplainable anomalies. Background research produced no evidence of
shipwrecks or other underwater cultural resources in the area of potential effects. HRA Gray
and Pape, LLC recommends that no further archaeological work be required and that the
project be cleared to proceed as currently planned.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Between February 10, 2010 and February 19, 2010, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray
& Pape), at the request of Houston Petrochemical, Inc. (Houston Petrochemical),
conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological investigations on approximately 1.6
hectares (4.0 acres) planned for dredge placement (Appendix A: Figure 1). An
underwater remote sensing survey of 1.1 hectares (2.8 acres) of submerged land adjacent
to the land tract was conducted by Dolan Research Inc. under contract to HRA Gray &
Pape. Fieldwork on the submerged portion was successfully completed in Upper San
Jacinto Bay on February 17, 2010.
The intensive pedestrian survey and underwater remote sensing survey of submerged
land was conducted in order to comply with United States Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) permitting requirements associated with wetlands impacted by the project. The
land is private property and the submerged land is owned by the Port of Houston
Authority. The Port of Houston is a political subdivision of the State of Texas and all
submerged land fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state
standards (the Antiquities Code of Texas 13 TAC 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 5552 (issued by the Texas Historical Commission [THC] in September of 2009).
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if land or submerged land
altering activities required to complete this project would affect any historic properties.
The procedures to be followed by the USACE to fulfill the requirements set forth in the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), other applicable historic preservation laws,
and Presidential directives as they relate to the regulatory program of the USACE (33
CFR Parts 320-334) are articulated in the Regulatory Program of the USACE, Part 325 Processing of Department of the Army Permits, Appendix C - Procedures for the
Protection of Historic Properties. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed
with reference to state (the Texas Council of Archeologists) and federal (NHPA)
guidelines.
Remote sensing investigations were conducted along the southern shoreline of Upper San
Jacinto Bay, Harris County, Texas (Appendix A: Figure 3). Project tasks performed
included: background and documentary research; magnetic and acoustic remote sensing
with follow-up target analysis, analysis of assembled research and field data; and
preparation of a draft findings and a final technical report. The purposes of these
investigations were twofold: to determine the presence or absence of potentially
significant submerged cultural resources; and secondly to assess likely project impacts
and make recommendations as to the need for further submerged cultural resources
studies.

1.1 Project Description
The project area is located on the Upper San Jacinto Bay in Harris County, Texas. The
1.6 hectares (4.0 acres) of land portion of the area of potential effect (APE) is rectangular.

The shoreline constitutes the northern boundary of the land tract. This same line is the
southern boundary of the 1.1 hectares (2.8 acres) of submerged land portion of the APE.
The submerged portion is the same width and extends into the Upper San Jacinto Bay.
The project proposed for the APE is dredging from the submerged portion and placement
of the dredge on the land portion. A placement area will be prepared and pipes running
on the surface from the placement area to the shoreline will drain the dredge. Anticipated
impacts are the compaction of soils by dredge and heavy equipment, and
disturbance/removal of submerged land by dredging.

1.2 Organization of the Report
This report is organized into 7 numbered chapters. Chapter 1.0 provides an overview of
the project. Chapter 2.0 presents an overview of the environmental setting and
geomorphology of the project areas. Chapter 3.0 presents a discussion of the cultural
context associated with the project areas and provides a discussion of previous
investigations. The submerged cultural resources potential is presented in Chapter 4.0.
Chapter 5.0 presents the research design and methodology developed for these
investigations. The results of these investigations are presented in Chapter 6.0. Chapter
7.0 presents the investigation summary and provides recommendations based on the
results of field surveys. A list of all references cited is provided in Chapter 8.0. All report
figures are provided in Appendix A at the back of the report.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA
The project area is located within the upper Texas Gulf Coastal Plain and is depicted on
the La Porte (#2995-414) United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
quadrangle map. The project area is on the Upper San Jacinto Bay and impacted by
hurricanes and differential sedimentation from the Bayous and the San Jacinto River. The
APE is underlain by Beaumont formation and is specified as dominantly clay and mud.
The area has low relief with pimple mounds, stream channels, and oxbows providing the
relief to the otherwise flat topography.
The APE is largely cleared and was the site of a home visible in 1978 aerial images. In
the 1978 image a home with an outbuilding is present on the northern 1/3 of the land and
the southern 2/3s are planted with pine trees in rows. The form of the land suggests that it
has not been dramatically altered by dredge placement. The planting of the trees and the
impacts associated with the modern occupation have likely disturbed much of the APE.
Channelization and wave action have likely eroded the shoreline and caused slumping of
the bank. Aerial images show the house was gone by 2002 and the property was cleared
by 2008.

2.1 Geomorphology
The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low, level to
gently sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain reaches
as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the Balcones
escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphic characteristics of the Texas coast and
associated inland areas, which includes Harris County, resulted from depositional
conditions influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance
in the northern portions of the continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in
the sediment load capacity of the regionâs rivers (Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001;
Barnes 1982; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human
occupation in modern-day Harris County include the Beaumont Formation, generally
believed to predate human occupation in the region, the so-called âDeweyville Terracesâ,
stratigraphically positioned between the Beaumont and Recent deposits, and Recent
deposits. The APE is underlain by Beaumont Formation.
The date of deposition for the Deweyville Terraces is not known. However, Abbott
(2001:16) among others believes the north-south oriented terraces aggraded during the
Late Pleistocene from overbank deposition of rivers and streams including the ancient
Brazos River prior to the beginning of the Holocene. Abbott suggests that aggradation of
this feature ended by approximately 20,000 before present (Abbott 2001:106). However,
meanders of rivers including the Brazos cut valleys through these terraces regularly
during the Holocene and then abandoned them. This process leaves a large, flat, open,
and well drained areas favored for campsites. While all depositional facies other than
channels have the potential to preserve archaeological sites, behaviorally, human activity
3

favors well drained, sandy channel-proximal localities over floodbasin muds (Abbott
2001:126). Other Recent or Holocene deposits on the Gulf Plain typically result from
overbank flooding of extant streams, eolian transport including dune formation, and
infilling of marshes.

2.2 Submerged Land
The rectangular project area, approximately 164.5 meters (540 feet) long and 68.5 meters
(225 feet) wide, extended north from the La Porte shoreline on the southern side of Upper
San Jacinto Bay. Across the project area, water depth was recorded between 0.9 and 1.8
meters (3 and 6 feet) deep. Coordinates for the offshore corners of the survey area were
provided by HRA Gray & Pape and are expressed in Texas State Plane (south- central)
coordinates (NAD83), in feet:

The project area in Upper San Jacinto Bay is located on the south side of a large unnamed
dredge spoil island adjacent to the Houston Ship Channel. Houston Ship Channel serves
as the navigation artery for the Port of Houston and empties into the Gulf of Mexico after
flowing through Galveston Bay. The Houston Ship Channel has been periodically
widened and deepened to accommodate increasingly-larger ships, and is currently
maintained at 160 meters (530 feet) wide by 14 meters (45 feet) deep by approximately
80.5 kilometers (50 miles) long. Several islands adjacent to the ship channel are part of
the ongoing dredging maintenance project. The islands are formed from soil pulled up by
dredging, and the salt marshes and bird islands are part of the Houston Port Authority's
beneficial use and environmental mitigation responsibilities (USACE 2005).
The project area is located in shallow, un-dredged waters located between the La Porte
shoreline and an unnamed dredge spoil island. At the project location, the shoreline
featured deteriorating wood bulkheads and the remains of at least one dock structure. A
small boat channel, 3 meters (10 feet) deep by 30 meters (100 feet) wide is maintained
across Upper San Jacinto Bay, approximately 300 meters (1,000 feet) north of the project
area.

2.3 Soils
Aldine-Urban land complex (An), is the only soils series represented on the land portion
of the APE (NRCS WSS 2010). Aldine-Urban land complex is composed of 25-75%
Aldine soil, 10-70% Urban land, and 5-20% of other soils. Aldine soils have a dark
grayish brown very fine sandy loam surface layer. Below that is a layer of very fine
grayish brown sandy loam. Next is a layer of yellowish brown loam. Below that is a
layer of gray clay with red and yellowish brown mottles. The final layer is light gray clay
loam. Small areas of Aris, Atasco, Bissonnet, Hockley, Segno, and Ozan soils can also
be included within these soils. Urban land soils have been altered by cutting and filling
or covered by structures. Small areas of Aris, Gessner, Hockley, Katy, and Ozan soils
can be seen with this soil. Aldine-Urban land complex (An) is considered to have a low
geoarchaeological potential (Abbott 2001:21).
Part of the submerged land is mapped as Atasco fine sandy loam. Atasco fine sandy loam
consists of a fine sandy layer typically 41 centimeters (16 inches) thick over a sandy clay
loam over a clay pan. These soils form in the Pleistocene sediment of river terraces
(NRCS WSS 2010). Atasco soils have a low probability for buried sites (Abbott 2001:21)

2.4 Climate
Harris Countyâs close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico tends to influence the temperature,
rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Winds usually trend from the southeast or
east, except during winter months when high-pressure systems can bring in polar air from
the north. Average temperatures in the summer can reach well into the 90s (degrees
Fahrenheit), and are often accompanied by equally high humidity. Although winter
temperatures can reach into the low 30s (degrees Fahrenheit), below freezing
temperatures usually occur on only a few days out of every year, and are typically
restricted to the early morning hours.
Rainfall is even throughout the year, with an average monthly distribution ranging from
between 43 centimeters (17 inches) to trace amounts; rainfall comes primarily from
thunderstorms, which tend to be heavy but of short duration (Wheeler 1976).

2.5 Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies at the southwestern boundary of the Austroriparian biotic province as
defined by Blair (1950). The APE is located within the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes
Region (Abbott 2001). Evidence from pollen analysis in Central Texas suggests that, at
least during the Late Pleistocene, the area may have been populated by vegetative species
that were tolerant of a cold weather environment. Climactic fluctuation during the
Holocene would eventually result in a gradual trend towards warmer weather, similar to
that seen today (Abbott 2001).

3.0 CULTURAL SETTING
3.1

Prehistoric Setting

Traditionally, Southeast Texas has been viewed as a buffer zone between cultural regions
in prehistoric times. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as
being an interface between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along
similar lines, both Shafer (1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic
archaeological record of this region as Woodland. This categorization is not meant to
literally invoke the exact cultural patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture
found to the east. Aten (1984:74) summarizes his concept by saying, âit loosely connotes
activities by populations on a geographic as well as a cultural periphery of the
southeastern Woodlands.â
Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested that the culture of Southeast Texas is distinctive
enough so as to merit a separate designation by the Late Prehistoric. The Mossy Grove
cultural tradition is a heuristic concept based on technological similarities shared by
groups in this region. The primary marker of this technological tradition is the plain,
sandy-paste Goose Creek pottery that is found in this region from the Early Ceramic
through Early Historic periods.
Ethnic affiliations for the region are not entirely clear. Aten (1983) has defined the
Brazos Delta-West Bay, Galveston Bay, and Sabine Lake archaeological areas and
suggests that they may correlate with the Historic territories of the Coco, Akokisa, and
Atakapa groups respectively. Similarly, historic reconstructions of the inland subregion
suggest a number of possible group affiliations (Story 1990). The historic economic
inland/coastal cycle of the Akokisa, which stretched from Galveston Bay to the San
Jacinto River basin, may mean that archaeological materials in the Lake Conroe area are
affiliated with this group. Alternately, these remains may be associated with the Bidais
who occupied territory immediately to the north of the Akokisa groups. At this point in
time it is not possible to identify the cultural affiliation of the groups that inhabited the
inland subregion. In part, this is a function of the dynamic nature of this region in which a
number of cultural traditions met and diffused.
The Southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin subregions, which
have archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and artifact
types. Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited inland
resources year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the
coast.
3.1.1 Prehistoric Archaeological Time Periods
Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified 6 archaeological time
periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these include
the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on

6

the general framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal
boundaries of these periods. Pattersonâs (1995) chronology, for example, includes Early
Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic
(5000-3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D.
100), Early Ceramic (A.D. 100-A.D. 600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500),
Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the Historic Indian (A.D. 1700-1800) periods. In
contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast Texas chronology that includes Paleoindian
(10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000-5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (5000-1000 B.C.),
Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400-A.D. 800), and Late
Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Despite these differences, the chronologies developed by
researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point technologies within the
region and the introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that a broad-based
hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods.

3.2 Historic Setting
The historic period began in the sixteenth century with the first Spanish coastline
explorations. It was during this period that the 1527 â 28 expedition fleet of Panfilo de
Narvaezâs was caught in a storm, leaving Cabeza de Vaca and a small group of castaways
marooned on the Isle of Misfortune, an unspecified island near Galveston, in 1528. The
group provided the first ethnohistorical accounts of the regionâs inhabitants.
La Salleâs ill-fated French expedition in 1685 explored the area around Matagorda Bay
and established Fort St. Louis near Garcitas Creek. La Salle had originally intended to
explore and colonize along the Mississippi River but the French ships made a critical
mistake in his navigation. La Salleâs fleet lost a supply ship while en route, and another
ran aground in Matagorda Bay. His men made enemies of the local Native American
population by shooting at them when the Native Americans attempted to take the French
supplies from the wrecked ship. La Salleâs fleet was further diminished when part of his
disgruntled crew took one of his remaining ships back to France. He lost the last ship in
April of 1686 when its drunken pilot sank it. La Salle and his remaining men attempted to
journey to the French Colonies around the Great Lakes, but none of them would survive.
La Salle himself was killed by Pierre Duhaut, one of several mutineers, near Navasota,
Texas, in March of 1687, and his body was left for the animals to eat. Six of the 17 who
had left Fort St. Louis with La Salle continued to Canada and, eventually, France. Six
other Frenchmen, including 2 deserters who had reappeared, remained among the east
Texas Indians.
At Fort St. Louis, La Salle had left hardly more than 20 persons with the crippled Gabriel
Minime, Sieur de Barbier, in charge. They consisted of women and children, the
physically handicapped, and those who for one reason or another had incurred La Salle's
disfavor. The Indians, learning of La Salle's death and the disunity among the French,
attacked the settlement by surprise around Christmas 1688, sparing only the children
(Weddle 2010).

7

The area remained in Indian control until the 1820âs. Southwest of the APE, Moses
Austin, father of Stephen F. Austin, planned a settlement in the 1820s as part of the
Spanish colonial government land grant. After his fatherâs death and the conclusion of the
Mexican Civil War, Stephen F. Austin renegotiated the deal with the new Mexican
government. Texas was at this point a province of Mexico, and the new government
issued the 1823 Imperial Colonization Law that allowed an empresario to receive land
grants. The empresario, Stephen F. Austin, and a governor appointed commissioner were
authorized to distribute land to settlers. The only lands settled under this law were the
first 300 land grants issued by Austin, known as the Old 300. This law was actually
annulled in March of 1823 as a result of the abdication of the Mexican Emperor Iturbide.
The succeeding provisional government issued a special decree allowing Austin's first
colony in April 1823 under the terms of the annulled Mexican law (Barker 2010, Long
2010).
Misunderstanding the bounds of Stephen F. Austinâs empresario grant, some early
settlers staked out land on the Brazos River in 1824. When Mexican authorities tried to
reverse the mistake, merchants and boatmen stayed behind recognizing the importance of
the waterways. These settlers petitioned for the area to be included in Austinâs grant and
were successful. Galveston Island and the Gulf shore were reserved for the Native
Americans making Harris County the southeastern border of the colony. In July 1824 a
state land commissioner, the Baron De Bastrop, issued titles to 29 settlers. Nathaniel
Lynch, William Scott, and John D. Harris, among others, chose sites along Buffalo
Bayou, the San Jacinto River, and the San Jacinto estuary (Barker 2010).
In 1826, John R. Harris laid out Harrisburg at the head of navigation on his property
where Brays Bayou joined Buffalo Bayou. Harris opened a store and built a saw and grist
mill. His brothers captained vessels between there and ports in Louisiana and Mexico.
Over the course of the next 6 years Harrisburg was an established port of entry for
immigrants and freight destined for locations up the Brazos River including San Felipe
and Washington. Additionally, important roads leading east from Harrisburg diverged
from this point. Travelers passing through on their way to Anahuac, Liberty, or
Nacogdoches crossed the San Jacinto River on Lynches Ferry. Another road paralleled
Buffalo Bayou and provided access to a community on Spring Creek, and then to the
Brazos villages. A third important road took travelers to the Oyster Creek area near the
site of present-day Stafford in Fort Bend County. Between 1824 and 1833 this area was
known as the San Jacinto District. It was renamed the Harrisburg District in 1833.
Under Mexican rule the area surrounding Harrisburg (as it came to be spelled by 1832)
was known as the San Jacinto District. The District stretched east from Lynchburg on the
San Jacinto River west to the location of present day Richmond, and from Clear Creek in
the south to Spring Creek in the north. Harrisburg County encompassed this same
territory with the addition of Galveston Island. The modern boundaries of Harris County
were established in 1838 (Hensen 2010). Local residents took part in the Anahuac
disturbances and the runaway scrape leading up to the revolutionary war. Santa Anna
looted and set fire to Harrisburg beginning April 14, 1836. The Battle of San Jacinto took

8

place on April 20 and 21 on widow Peggy McCormick's farm approximately 5.6
kilometers (3.5 miles) north of the APE (Kemp 2010).

Harris County was formed as Harrisburg County on December 22, 1836 soon after the
Texas Revolution. The county was renamed Harris in December 1839 to honor John R.
Harris, the early pioneer who established Harrisburg in 1826, the first town site in the
county. The lands that would become Harris County comprised the southeastern border
of Austinâs Colony. The early settlers in the region were mostly from the southern United
States who brought with them their African slaves. In the 1840s, large numbers of
German and French immigrants settled in Harris County. The Hispanic presence in the
region was relatively sparse prior to an influx of immigrants following the Mexican
Revolution reflecting the ephemeral nature of Spanish and Mexican colonization (Hensen
2010).
The founding of the City of Houston by Augustus and John Allen was announced in a
newspaper advertisement of August 1836. The brothers managed to convince the
delegates of the first Texas Congress to establish the yet-to-be-built Houston as the first,
albeit temporary (1837-1840), capital of Texas. In 1837, Houston also became the seat of
Harrisburg County. The town was laid out on a grid plan with streets running parallel and
perpendicular to Buffalo Bayou near the confluence of White Oak Bayou. The town grew
rapidly from 12 inhabitants and 1 log cabin in January of 1837 to 1500 people and 100
houses 4 months later (Hensen 2010).
Initially the city was not segregated and slaves lived scattered throughout the cityâs
neighborhoods. There was a separate social structure for the whites and subordinate
blacks which continued beyond the Civil War and Emancipation. Schools, churches, and
businesses continued to be segregated and by the end of the nineteenth century residential
segregation was also present. Separate white, black, and later on Hispanic neighborhoods
divided the city.
The immigrants that came to the area following the Civil War founded settlements along
the rail lines that bisected the county. The Houston communities of Pasadena, Deer Park,
Houston Heights, Bellaire, Webster, La Porte, South Houston, and Genoa developed in
this manner and were eventually annexed into the city of Houston. By the 1930s, Harris
County was the largest county and Houston was the largest city in Texas.
By the mid nineteenth century, Houston and Harris County had become a center of
commerce. Products were imported into the Texas hinterland through Houston after being
offloaded from ocean going ships in Galveston. Exports included agricultural products
such as cotton, corn, and cow hides. The town became a railroad hub with 6 railways
spreading from 80.5 to 160.9 kilometers (50 to 100 miles) to the northwest, east, west,
south, and southeast. In 1873, Houston joined the national rail network when the Houston
and Texas Central reached Denison (Hensen 2010).
The expansion of Buffalo Bayou was essential to the commercial life of Houston and a
number of private ventures were undertaken over the years to widen and deepen the

9

channel. The USACE took control of the project in 1881, eventually creating the 15.2meter (50-foot) deep Houston Ship Channel from Galveston Bay to a turning basin above
Brays Bayou. Additional public works projects included the creation of Lake Houston
reservoir in 1954 to reduce the dependence on subsurface water, the use of which had
caused up to 3 meters (9 feet) of subsidence surrounding the confluence of Buffalo Bayou
and the San Jacinto River. In 1935, the Harris County Flood Control District was
established and infrastructures such as the Addicks and Barker dams in western Harris
County were constructed. Channelization projects since this time along Houston area
bayous have significantly modified the landscape, and doubtlessly have affected
archaeological sites along these waterways. However, isolated and undisturbed areas
along these watercourses may still contain intact deposits (Abbott 2001:101).
The discovery of oil at Spindletop made Houston an important center for the petroleum
industry. The Ship Channelâs inland location made it safe from Gulf storms and refineries
began lining the banks in 1918. By 1929, 40 oil companies had offices in Houston. The
outbreak of World War II created a demand for products made of petrochemicals. The
city would go on to become 1 of the 2 largest petrochemical concentrations in the United
States (Hensen 2010).
3.2.1 San Jacinto Bay area and the Port of Houston
A brickyard and a few small boatyards were operating at Lynchburg and Goose Creek
supplying the building boom in Galveston in the late 1800s. Between 1903 and 1907 oil
was struck in the area. Pelly was founded in 1917 to serve roughnecks employed by the
oil camps. In 1919, Humble Oil and Refining Company (now Exxon) built an oil refinery
on the San Jacinto River. Baytown was a company town for workers. Goose Creek was
the home of executives. Humble sold the company town to the residents in the late 1920s.
These 2 towns and 1 other merged and were renamed Baytown in 1948. The HoustonNorth Shore Railroad in eastern Harris County connected this area and Crosby to
downtown Houston (Henson 2010, Sibley 2010).
The formation of the Harris County Ship Channel Navigation District, authorized by
Congress and approved by the state legislature allowed the district to manage the already
important waterway. This in turn led to its improvements and ultimately to Houston
becoming an industrial power. From less than 2 meters (6 feet) deep the channel was
dredged to a depth of 7.6 meters (25 feet) by USACE in 1914. By 1918, refineries started
to locate along Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River. Other port businesses also
located there and eventually the channel was deepened to 15 meters (50 feet) and
widened. Ongoing dredging and changes to the shoreline to facilitate the growth of the
area have altered the course of waterways and created large areas of fill along the banks.
The success of the Ship Channel in attracting industry caused the surge in population that
resulted in Houston and Harris County becoming larger than Dallas and Dallas County
(Hensen 2010). The Port of Houston Authority is the current name of the independent
political subdivision of Texas that operates the Port of Houston (Sibley 2010).
Because the Texas coast has no natural deepwater harbors and sediments of the rivers
foul their mouths, early shipbuilding in Texas was a rare enterprise that focused on
10

constructing small boats for fishing and river navigation. Steamboats ran routes around
the coast and up the rivers. These ships were constructed at many locations along the east
coast but not in Texas. In 1845, a ship built for commerce on the Colorado River sailed
from Matagorda. In Harris County shipbuilding began in 1856. Just before and after
World War I, shipbuilding began to grow into a large industry. The demand for merchant
ships as a result of World War I was so strong that wooden ships were in demand. Texas
opened several shipbuilding and ship-repair yards in the Beaumont-Orange, Houston,
Galveston Bay, and Corpus Christi areas utilizing local yellow pine. A fleet of 14 wooden
barkentines and schooners were produced during the course of the war. After World War
I the shipbuilding industry across America suffered the effects of the Great Depression
and other problems (Peebles 2010).
Wooden fishing boats and smaller transport vessels were the first European-style vessels
in the Bays of eastern Texas. Steamboats and sailing ships were early types plying the
Upper San Jacinto Bay. These early days saw the first use of iron, at first as a covering
and later as the entire frame and structure. Civil War blockade runners used iron cladding
for protection from warships enforcing the blockade. Steamships and sailing ships were
common into the early 1900s. By the time of the Spanish-American War large warships
were powered by steam powering screw propellers. Shortages of ships were caused by
the aggressive U-boat campaign. This in conjunction with a shortage of iron and steel led
to Texas shipbuilders building a fleet of 14 wooden barkentines and schooners during the
course of World War I and similar types were likely used in commerce in the area during
this same time. With World War II came the San Jacinto Ordinance Depot just a few
miles north of the APE. Shipments of ordinance for the Army and Navy flowed past the
APE during World War II and through the Korean War. Diesel engines became the most
common power for ships. Oil tankers became common with the discovery of the
Spindletop oil fields in the early 1900s. The first oil tankers were sailing ships but these
were soon replaced by steam ships. Modern freighters, barges, tankers, and towboats
have dominated Texas shipping since the 1940s (Peebles 2010).

3.3 Previous Investigations
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal Plain
tend to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits. Typically, these sites consist of
temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence
of multiple cultural components within a mixed context. Historic sites near the project
area typically consist of farms or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early
twentieth centuries.
The majority of larger inland sites consist of sandy middens with high lithic material
counts and moderate amounts of pottery located near water sources. These sites are
generally considered base camps and there is a notable absence of satellite activity areas.
Distinct activity loci are present within the base camps (Patterson 1995).
Lithic artifacts recovered at sites near the current project area are primarily manufactured
from chert and petrified wood. Chert deposits are concentrated in the western portion of

11

the south Texas region, while petrified wood dominates in the eastern portion of the
region. This geographic parity is generally reflected in the types of materials found at
sites. Sites in the western and central portions of south Texas have predominately chert
artifacts with some petrified wood. Conversely, artifacts recovered from sites in the
eastern portion of south Texas are mainly manufactured of petrified wood (Patterson
1995). Extra-local lithic materials found in the region include Edwards Plateau chert and
ground stone from Arkansas sources. The presence of these materials may suggest the
presence of regional trade networks or the movement of groups or individuals into the
region, as in the case of the Edwards Plateau material.
Inland sites have a high debitage to core ratio suggesting that primary reduction most
often was carried out at source locations. Patterson (1995) suggested that the presence of
point preforms in various stages of production and failure at campsites indicate that
blanks and preforms were being transported back to these locations for final reduction.
The unifacial tools found at sites are typically flakes utilized from the bifacial thinning
process. These tool types include scrapers, denticulates, notched tools, perforators, and
gravers. These formal tools occur only in small numbers at inland sites.
Projectile point types, along with ceramics on the coastal margin, are the most distinctive
artifacts associated with archaeological sites in southeast Texas. The various types serve
as hallmarks of the cultural periods of the region. These types range from the Clovis and
Folsom points made in the Paleoindian period, to the dart points of the Archaic including
La Jita, to the dart points such as Lange of Late Archaic/Early Ceramic, and finally to the
arrow points of the Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 500 or 600). Adjacent regions through time
including the southern plains, southeast woodlands, Louisiana, and north, central, and
south Texas influenced the projectile point technologies found in the region.
Most sites near the coast between the Brazos River and Sabine Lake consist of middens
of clams found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams (Aten 1983; Patterson
1995). These middens usually contain faunal material as well as cultural remains such as
lithic tools and pottery. Inland sites are less likely to consist of middens and are more
similar to generalized open campsites. In both areas, sites are found near stream channels.
A brief overview of selected research projects conducted near the present undertaking is
presented below.
Addicks Reservoir was one of the earliest projects conducted in the area (Wheat 1953).
The research done during that project initialized the formation of the Galveston Bay
Focus and the development of a cultural sequence of the region based on lithics and
ceramics (Aten 1983). The cultural context of the upper coastal region is described by
Aten (1983) and Story (1990). This information is merged with the archaeological data
here to give a complete picture of life on the Upper Texas Coast.
HRA Gray & Pape (Hughey et al. 2004) in preparation for a temporary bridge crossing
across Oyster Creek conducted a survey of a 0.08-hectare (0.2-acre) section of Old
Oyster Creek in May 2004. Historic site 41FB292 was discovered during the course of
the survey. The site was composed of historic artifacts located primarily within the top 20

12

centimeters (8 inches) below the surface. Artifacts included low-fired brick fragments,
glass, square nails, and metal fragments. This site was not recommended for inclusion in
the NRHP (Hughey et al. 2004).
Approximately 283 hectares (700 acres) in Fort Bend County south of the current project
area was also investigated by HRA Gray & Pape. However, work on this project is also
ongoing and HRA Gray & Pape has not made any recommendations at this time. Soils
and paleosols encountered during this survey generally conformed to profiles of low
floodplain Miller-Pledger-Roebuck association soils and included dark reddish brown
and reddish brown Miller clay at shallow depths. These were underlain by a fairly
widespread Pledger-like paleosol, which was often underlain by partially eroded,
discontinuous older paleosols most closely resembling Pledger and other low floodplain
soils of the Miller-Pledger-Roebuck association.
HRA Gray & Pape (Soltysiak 2008) also performed a survey of 65 hectares (160 acres)
about 6.5 kilometers (4 miles) south-southwest of the APE. The area was largely
disturbed by imported fill and no sites were recorded.
EH&A later changing itâs name to PBS&J conducted underwater surveys along the
Houston-Galveston navigation channel more than 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) north of the
project area in the 1990s and early 2000s. No ship wrecks were recorded within 1.6
kilometers (1 mile) of the APE.

4.0 SUBMERGED CULTURAL RESOURCES
ASSESSMENT
This chapter addresses in broad terms the potential for submerged cultural resources
within the Upper San Jacinto Bay project area.

4.1 National Register of Historic Places Nomination Process
Potential shipwreck sites may be considered potentially significant properties that are
eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places. To qualify for the
National Register of Historic Places, a site "must be significant in American history,
architecture, archaeology, engineering, or culture, and possess integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association." To be considered
significant the site must meet 1 or more of 4 National Register criteria. These criteria
include:
A. Association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
B. Association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. Embodiment of the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or
that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction; or
D. Sites that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history.
National Register Bulletin 20 clarifies the National Register process for shipwrecks and
other submerged cultural resources. Shipwrecks must meet at least one of the above
criteria and retain integrity of location, design, settings, materials, workmanship, feelings
and association. Determining the significance of a historic vessel depends on
establishing whether the vessel is:
1. the sole, best, or a good representative of a specific vessel type; or
2. is associated with a significant designer or builder; or
3. was involved in important maritime trade, naval recreational, government, or
commercial activities.
Properties, which qualify for the National Register, must have significance in one or
more "Areas of Significance" that are listed in National Register Bulletin 16. Although
29 specific categories are listed, only some are relevant to potential submerged cultural

14

resources in the Houston Ship Channel region. Architecture, commerce, engineering,
industry, invention, maritime history, and transportation are potentially applicable data
categories for the type of submerged cultural resources which may be expected in the
project area.

5.0 METHODS
5.1 Site File and Literature Review
Background and site file research was initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization.
Background literature search included a review of both archaeological site files and
architectural resource files and a review of previously conducted cultural resource
surveys in the vicinity. This information was obtained by reviewing records through the
Texas Sites Atlas (maintained by the THC). Cultural resources identified during this
literature search included previously recorded archaeological sites and previously conducted
cultural resources surveys.

5.2 Field Methods
Field investigation on this project consisted of intensive pedestrian survey (a combination
of walkover reconnaissance and shovel testing) and inspection of the shoreline bluff.
5.2.1 Intensive Pedestrian Survey
Archaeological survey methods utilized during the intensive pedestrian survey consisted of
observation point survey. Observation points provide a reference to maintain horizontal
control and provenience across a given survey area. In general, these observation points are
positioned at 30-meter (100-foot) intervals in areas considered to possess high probability
for containing cultural materials and at wider intervals in low-potential areas. Regardless of
the interval, linear transects were utilized for the positioning of the observation points across
the specific survey area. Dependent upon the terrain, environmental setting, and
groundcover identified at each observation point location, 1 of 2 possible actions (surface
inspection or subsurface testing) was performed. All actions performed at a specific
observation point location, the general observations of the surveyor, and the results of
survey actions were recorded on an observation point log, which include provenience,
survey method, and cultural materials identified.
Transects were spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart across the entire project area. Shovel
test excavation was guided by a stratified selection process that targeted the shoreline and
areas that would be most heavily impacted by the project. The remainder of the APE was
subjected only to judgmental tests. One wall of each shovel test was profiled and the
walls and floor of each test were inspected for color or texture change potentially
associated with the presence of cultural features. Where matrix clay content and density
did not facilitate screening, back dirt was hand sorted in an effort to locate artifacts.
Soil profiles observed in all shovel tests were described using tested approaches for
describing basic soil properties (see Munsell 2000; Schoeneberger et al. 2002; Vogel
2002). Comparisons of soil profiles observed in the field were made to the soil series
type section descriptions available in SSS NRCS USDA (2010).

5.2.2 Underwater Archaeological Survey
Sonar and magnetic survey operations were conducted separately from a 7.3 meters (24Â­
foot) fiberglass vessel. Sonar data were gathered with a Marine Sonic two channel digital
side scan sonar unit with a 600kHz side scan sensor. Due to shallow water conditions, the
sonar sensor was towed off the bow of the survey boat and was operated at a range of
164â in either channel which created a swath of acoustic coverage 328â wide on each
survey lane. Marine Sonic data acquisition software was used to merge the acoustic data
with real-time positioning data.
Magnetic data were collected with a Geometrics 881 cesium marine magnetometer,
capable of +/- 1/10 gamma resolution. A Â½-second sampling rate by the magnetometer's
towed sensor, coupled with a 4-knot vessel speed, assured a magnetic sample every .7
meters (2 feet). The magnetometer sensor was towed with a float (due to shallow water
conditions) 15.3 meters (50 feet) aft of the survey vessel to provide optimal conditions
for collecting magnetic data. The magnetometer collected data on the ambient magnetic
field strength by measuring the variation in cesium electron energy states. As the sensor
passed over objects containing ferrous metal, a fluctuation in the earthâs magnetic field
was recorded. The fluctuation was measured in gammas and is proportional to the amount
of ferrous metal contained in the sensed object.
Hypack, a laptop PC-based software package in conjunction with a Differential Global
Positioning System (DGPS) onboard the survey vessel provided positioning accuracy for
the survey area of +/- 1 meter (3 feet). The computer converted positioning data from the
DGPS to Texas (south-central) State Plane Coordinates in real time. These x,y
coordinates were used to guide the survey vessel precisely along predetermined tracklines
that had been established at 15.3-meter (50-foot) offsets that were oriented parallel with
the shoreline (Appendix 1: Figure 5). While surveying, vessel positions were continually
updated on the computer monitor to assist the vessel operator, and the processed x,y data
were continually logged on computer disk for post-processing and plotting.

System, NAD 83, in feet.
5.2.2.1

Data Products - Side Scan Sonar

The side scan sonar derives its information from reflected acoustic energy. Side looking
sonar, which transmits and receives swept high frequency bandwidth signals from
transducers mounted on a sensor that is towed from a survey vessel. Two sets of
transducers mounted in an array along both sides of the towfish generate the short
duration acoustic pulses required for high resolution images. The pulses are emitted in a
thin, fan-shaped pattern that spreads downward to either side of the towfish in a plane
perpendicular to its path. As the fish is towed along the survey trackline this acoustic
beam sequentially scans the bottom from a point beneath the fish outward to each side of
the trackline.

17

Acoustic energy reflected from any bottom discontinuities (exposed pipelines, rocks, or
other obstructions) is received by the set of transducers, amplified and transmitted to the
survey vessel via a tow cable. The digital output from state of the art units is essentially
analogous to a high angle oblique photograph provided detailed representations of bottom
features and characteristics. Sonar allows display of positive relief (features extending
above the bottom) and negative relief (such as depressions) in either light or dark
opposing contrast modes on a video monitor. Examination of the images thus allows a
determination of significant features and objects present on the bottom within a survey
area.
Raw sonar records were inspected for potential man-made features and obstructions
present on the bottom surface. Sonar data were saved in files that covered approximately
244 meters (800-feet) along any survey lane. Individual acoustic data files were initially
examined using SeaScanâ¢ acoustic data review software to identify any unnatural or
man-made features in the records. Once identified, acoustic features were described
using visible length, width, and height from the bottom surface. Acoustic targets are
normally defined according to their spatial extent, configuration, location and
environmental context. The coordinates of acoustic features also were recorded, as
necessary.
Later, raw sonar data files were edited using software from Chesapeake Technologyâ¢ to
remove the water column from the records and the processed sonar files were inspected
for man-made features. A geo-referenced sonar mosaic was then compiled from the
processed sonar files (Appendix 1: Figure 4).
5.2.2.2

Data Products - Magnetometer

Magnetic data were edited for detailed analysis. Also, the editing process was used to
remove background noise and to create a magnetic contour map (depicted at 1-gamma
intervals) (Appendix 1: Figure 5). Magnetic targets were also overlaid onto the sonar
mosaic (Appendix 1: Figure 6).
Magnetic data editing consisted of using Hypackâs single-beam editing program to
review raw data (of individual survey lines) and to delete any artificially induced noise or
data spikes. Once all survey lines for an area were edited, the edited data were converted
to an xyz file also using Hypack (easting, and northing, in Texas (south-central) State
Plane Coordinates (NAD83), and magnetometer data â measured in gammas). Next,
general background was subtracted from each successive data sample to develop the
actual field gradient. The gradient is the vertical difference (z) between samples. By
subtracting successive data samples one from the other the effects of diurnal change is
completely eliminated. The resulting data represents only the localized changes in the
magnetic background created by ferrous objects (i.e. anomalies) or geological features.
When graphically represented by contouring (using the same method described above),
only the intensity of variation is represented.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Background and site file research including a review of both archaeological site files and
architectural resource files and a review of previously conducted cultural resource
surveys in the vicinity found that no sites were recorded in the project area. Five sites
have been recorded in the study radius. Six cultural resource surveys have been
completed within the study radius. No sites, features, or isolated artifacts were found
during any part of the survey.

6.1 Literature Review
Site file research was conducted at Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
and supplemented by consulting online research archives maintained by the THC. The
goal of the research efforts was to produce a listing of all archaeological sites within 1.6
kilometers (1 mile) of the project area and all historic structures eligible for NRHP listing
located immediately adjacent to the projectâs APE. Sites recorded on similar soils and
landforms outside the 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) study radius of the project area were also
studied to help in modeling cultural resource distribution.
Studies of aerial imagery and topographic maps (USGS 1978, 2006, 2008, 2010) and of
were conducted as part of this project in an effort to identify possible historical structures
and to assess historic and recent land use in the project area.
Cultural resources identified during the literature search included previously recorded
archaeological sites and previously conducted cultural resources surveys. No previously
recorded architectural resources or NRHP properties were located within the boundaries
of the current project study radius. Background research conducted in the THC Texas
Sites Atlas indicated that five archaeological sites are located within 1.6 kilometers (1
mile) of the current project. These sites are 41HR71, 160, 260, 261, and 613. Six surveys
have been completed within the study radius and are presented in tabular form below
(Table 1).

Site 41HR71 is a rangia shell midden first recorded in the 1966 by A. R. Duke. It is
described as a 4 to 12 inches (10 â 30.5 centimeters) thick layer of rangia shells mixed
with numerous Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts. The midden was described as
30-meter (100-foot) long area along the bluff by Duke. However, in 1980, Good revisited
the site and described it as a 152.5 meters (500-foot) long midden. He also mentions a
historic homestead on the same property. Good recommended limited testing only; citing
slump and erosion as causing disturbance to most of the site.
Site 41HR160 is a clam shell midden located in a similar position on the bluff
overlooking the San Jacinto Bay. This site is about 600 meters (1968 feet) west of site
41HR71. Fragmented pottery was found among the clam shell. The midden was
relatively small and erosion and slumping had damaged the site to the point that no
further investigation was recommended. The site was recorded by A. R. Duke in 1971.
Site 41HR260 is a rangia shell midden was recorded by Paul McGuff and Mike Thomas
in 1971 as part of the Galveston Bay Survey. The midden is located about 883 meters
(2900 feet) northwest of the APE and described as 2-5 centimeters (1 or 2 inches) thick at
the waters edge. A few pottery sherds and a stone bowl were found in the midden.
Recorders judged the site to be in good to excellent condition.
Site 41HR261 is located about 1120 meters (3675 feet) northwest of the APE. It is
described as a Late Prehistoric, 182 metes (600-foot) long, midden that is largely
submerged. Recorders recognized the midden below water level. Recorders McGuff and
Thomas recommended testing in 1971 (b). This site was also found during the Galveston
Bay Survey.
Site 41HR613 is located approximately 1250 meters northwest of the APE. It is another
similarly thick rangia shell midden originally recorded by Duke (1966), later by McGuff
(1973), and finally revisited by Moore (1988). Only the Moore site form was available on
the Atlas. Mammal bones and rangia shells 80-100 meters (262-328 feet) long exposed in
a cut-bank about 20-30 centimeters (8-12 inches) below the natural surface which is now
7 meters (22 feet) below dredge.

6.2 Field Investigations
Land and submerged land surveys were performed between February 10th and 20th, 2010
(Appendix 1: Figures 1 and 3). Field investigation of the land portion of the APE
consisted of a pedestrian survey employing 30-meter (100-foot) transect spacing and
shovel testing. The entire project was pedestrian surveyed with 30-meter (100-foot)
transect spacing to examine the surface for historic or visible prehistoric cultural
resources. Shovel tests were employed for subsurface inspection throughout the project
but were concentrated along the shoreline and areas where the heaviest impacts are
expected. A total of 16 shovel tests were performed in the project area (Appendix 1:
Figure 2). The survey and all of the subsurface tests were negative for cultural remains.

6.3 Land Survey
A Shell scatter, concrete foundation of a probable barn, the ruins of a wooden structure,
and push piles with bricks, concrete, and modern refuse were noted during the survey.
The shoreline is slumping and a shell scatter along the bluff and down the face was
demonstrated by the excavation of a shovel test to have no depth. The sparse scatter of
shells was intermixed with modern refuse. None of the refuse appeared to be more than
50 years old. Two long discontinuous push piles ran north-south almost the entire length
of the APE. The amount of soil in these piles suggests substantial surface disturbance.
The ruins and remains of a residence and outbuildings were all modern materials with
dimensional lumber, wire nails, factory made bricks, and Portland mortar and concrete.
Disturbances were clear from surface inspection and shovel tests. Shovel Test C-02
clearly showed disturbed sediments to over 60 centimeters (2 feet) below the surface
(Appendix A: Figure 2). This test was placed near to the apparent location of a structure.
Most of the remains including large amounts of brick with Portland mortar were
contributors to the push piles.
Along the shoreline, bricks and cement are piled up along the waters edge as erosion
retardant. The edge slumped into the water and the only areas not slumping were held up
by this make-shift rip ârap. The shovel test closest to the shoreline (ST-J4) showed
fragments of concrete in the upper levels and mixed sediments to 100 cmbs (3.3 feet
below the surface) (Appendix A: Figure 2). No artifacts were found or collected during
any part of the survey. No sites were recorded or revisited.

6.4 Underwater Survey
Analysis of magnetic signatures identified during the survey was based on several
criteria. After magnetic data were contour plotted, each anomaly was analyzed according
to: magnetic intensity (total distortion of the magnetic background measured in gammas);
pulse duration (detectable signature duration); signature characteristics (negative
monopolar, positive monopolar, dipolar, or multi-component); and spatial extent (total
area of disturbance). Acoustic (side scan sonar) targets were analyzed according to their
spatial extent, configuration, location, and environmental context. Magnetic records were

23

correlated with the acoustic targets to provide any further information on the identity of
the material generating the remote sensing signatures. Additional investigation or
avoidance was recommended for target signatures with the potential to yield submerged
cultural resources.
6.4.1 Magnetic Data
Inspection of the remote sensing records confirms the presence of 4 magnetic targets in
the overall survey area. One of the targets (#1) is located beyond the limits of the project
area (center of anomaly is 40 meters (132 feet) beyond offshore limit). The anomaly
generated a strong, dipolar signature that was concentrated in a defined area, rather than
dispersed across a wide area. The signature appears to be associated with a single-source
object with a large percentage of ferrous mass. There was no corresponding sonar
signature at that location, confirming that the target source is buried.
The other 3 magnetic anomalies were located on the survey lanes closest to the shoreline.
It appears that the 3 anomalies were all generated by shoreline-related structures, e.g.
bulkheads and abandoned pier components. There were no corresponding sonar targets
at these locations, with the exception of the images of the shoreline structures.
See Table 2, below, for a discussion of all magnetic targets.

6.4.2 Sonar Data
Sonar records confirmed the presence of a flat mud bottom with widespread circular features;
suggestive of sea grass or other marine vegetation. No man-made features were identified with
the sonar on or above the bottom surface. Detailed images of the shoreline did not reveal the
presence of any potentially significant shoreline-related structures that extended out into the
near-shore area (Appendix 1: Figure 9).

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report summarizes the results of an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey and
underwater survey. The land survey was conducted on 1.6 hectares (4.0 acres) of property
proposed for dredge placement in Harris County, Texas. The underwater survey was
conducted on submerged land adjacent to the land area on the Upper San Jacinto Bay.
Prior to fieldwork mobilization, a background literature and site file search was
conducted to identify the presence of recorded sites near the project area. The search
indicated that no previously recorded archaeological sites are located within the APE.
Five sites are recorded within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the APE. Six surveys had been
performed within the study radius. Historic research revealed no specific activities or
events in the project area that would leave physical evidence such as historic structures or
battlefields.

7.1 Land Survey
This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian survey conducted on property
proposed for dredge placement on the Upper San Jacinto Bay, Harris County, Texas. No
archaeological sites or historic structures were recorded in the study area before the
fieldwork and no sites were found within the APE during fieldwork. Fieldwork consisted
of surface inspection and shovel testing within the APE. The intensive pedestrian survey
found no evidence of any historic or prehistoric cultural remains in any part of the APE.
A total of 16 shovel tests were performed within the APE. These were all negative for
cultural material. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to
State (the Antiquities Code of Texas) and Federal (NHPA) guidelines. HRA Gray & Pape
recommends that no further archaeological work be required and that the project be
cleared to proceed as planned.

7.2 Underwater Survey
Background research confirms historic maritime activity in the Upper San Jacinto Bay
from as early as 1856. As a result of this prolonged maritime activity, potential
submerged cultural resources may exist in the vicinity of the Upper San Jacinto Bay
project area. Planned construction activities have the potential to impact underwater
resources that may exist with the project area.
A comprehensive remote magnetic and acoustic remote sensing survey was conducted
within a defined rectangular search area adjacent to the La Porte shoreline. This survey
resulted in the identification of 1 large-scale magnetic anomaly and 3 low-intensity
magnetic targets. The signature of the large scale anomaly (Target #1) appears to be
associated with a single-source object with a large percentage of ferrous mass. There was
no corresponding sonar signature at that location, confirming that the target source is
buried. However, this anomaly is located beyond 40 meters (132 ft) the offshore limits of
the project area and no impact will occur at this location according to project designs.

26

Three low-intensity magnetic anomalies (Targets # 2-4) were also identified close to the
shoreline where bulkheads and abandoned pier components were located. It appears that
the 3 anomalies were all generated by shoreline-related structures, e.g. bulkheads and
abandoned pier components, rather than shipwreck remains or other submerged cultural
resources. No corresponding sonar features were found at the 3 locations with the
exception of the shoreline structures.
None of the targets within the project limits were considered to be suggestive of a
potentially significant submerged cultural resource and no additional underwater
archaeological work is recommended within the project boundaries. The results of the
study support of Section 106 finding of No Historic Properties present.
