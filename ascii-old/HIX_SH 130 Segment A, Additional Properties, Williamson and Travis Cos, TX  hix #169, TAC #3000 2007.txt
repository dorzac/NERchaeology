Abstract

Hicks & Company conducted archeological investigations for the Additional Properties within Seg­
ment A of the proposed SH 130 right-of-way within Williamson and Travis Counties, Texas. A total of 240
parcels were investigated within the Additional Properties, 39 of these were recommended for survey. All
of these Additional Properties were located on privately owned land at the time of the survey investiga­
tions. A total of 76.77 acres were surveyed with a total of 156 shovel tests and 14 backhoe trenches between
July 2003 and December 2004. Four previously recorded sites and two new sites were identified within the
Additional Properties of the proposed SH 130 right-of-way. Sites 41WM1010, 41WM1012, 41WM1013,
41WM1091, 41TV1417, and 41TV2130 were all determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
within the Additional Properties in Segment A of SH 130. All investigations were conducted in accordance
with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and 36 CFR 800, the Texas Antiquities
Code (13 TAC 26), the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic
Preservation (48 FR 44716-44742), and the Secretary’s Standards for Identification (48 FR 44720-44723),
the Protocol for Historic Property Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment for the SH 130 Project, the
Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the THC, the FHWA, TxDOT, and the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation, and TAC #3000. All archeological deposits identified within the project area were
evaluated using the NRHP criteria of significance (36 CFR 60.4). All collected artifacts and project
materials will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

Management Summary and Introduction

accommodate the main highway located outside of
the schematic right-of-way that will be acquired in
connection with the project and controlled by the
State of Texas. The EDA schematic combined with
the Additional Properties is referred to as the “Ulti­
mate Schematic” (Plates 1 through 5). Hicks &
Company was retained by LSI to manage environ­
mental compliance with the FEIS and Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,
as amended. As part of the environmental compli­
ance team Hicks & Company conducted archeologi­
cal investigations for all of the Additional Proper­
ties along the proposed SH 130 right-of-way. This
report presents the results of those investigations
within the Additional Properties in Segment A of
the proposed SH 130 right-of-way.
TAC Permit #3000 is currently issued to Hicks
& Company for the coordination of Additional Prop­
erties along the proposed SH 130 Segment A,
Williamson and Travis, Counties, Texas. Segment
A was divided into two segments, Segments 1 and
2, subsequent to the FEIS and these segments were
further divided into 10 sections. These divisions
were used primarily by LSI as a tool for construc­
tion planning, however, Hicks & Company adopted
these divisions to accommodate the construction
schedule of LSI. The Additional Properties in Seg­
ment A overlap a total of 240 parcels. Parcels rep­
resent the property divisions with single or multiple
landowners. Of the 240 parcels, 140 were not coor­
dinated with TxDOT or the Texas Historical Com­
mission (THC), based on an amendment to the origi­
nal permit. The permit amendment excluded par­
cels from coordination that were located in low or
moderate probability areas as defined by PBS&J
during their investigations. The remaining 100 par­
cels were all subjected to pre-survey investigations

State Highway 130 is a proposed toll road that
extends from IH-35, north of the city of George­
town, Texas, to IH-10, near the city of Seguin,
Texas in Williamson, Travis, Caldwell, and Guada­
lupe Counties. As required by the National Envi­
ronmental Policy Act, an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) was prepared to address the im­
pacts to environmental and cultural resources along
several alternatives. During the preparation of the
EIS, the proposed SH 130 right-of-way was di­
vided into three segments, Segment A, Segment
B, and Segment C. Following approval of the Fi­
nal Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS),
PBS&J was contracted by the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) to perform archeo­
logical investigations within the proposed SH 130
right-of-way. The area investigated by PBS&J rep­
resented the final schematic of the proposed SH
130, as it existed at the time of the Exclusive
Development Agreement between Lone Star In­
frastructure (LSI), Federal Highway Administra­
tion (FHWA), Texas Department of Transporta­
tion (TxDOT), and the Texas Turnpike Authority
(TTA). The final schematic generally follows the
preferred alternative selected as a result of the
FEIS. For the purposes of this report the final
schematic surveyed by PBS&J is referred to as the
EDA schematic.
TxDOT and the TTA contracted LSI to con­
struct the proposed SH 130 right-of-way. LSI uti­
lized a “design-build” approach that allowed for
minor adjustments to the design footprint over the
course of the construction. This design-build ap­
proach resulted in the creation of additional areas of
right-of-way outside of the EDA schematic. These
Additional Properties consisted of drainage ease­
ments, maintenance facilities, and design changes to

followed by the submittal of an impact evaluation
with recommendations for survey or non-survey.
The pre-survey investigations consisted of field
visits to evaluate the integrity of the parcels, re­
visit previously recorded cultural resources, and
determine the probability for cultural resources to
occur. Sixty-one parcels were recommended for
no survey based on a low probability for archeo­
logical sites to occur. The remaining 39 parcels
were surveyed, resulting in the identification of
two new archeological sites, 41WM1091 and
41TV2103. Two parcels were recommended for
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eli­
gibility testing at Site 41WM1010. The survey
investigations were summarized in standardized
interim reports that included an overview of the
specific project area, a summary of the previous
investigations, an environmental and cultural sum­
mary, the results of the field investigations, and
conclusions and recommendations.

A total of 156 shovel tests and 14 backhoe
trenches were excavated within the Additional
Properties in Segment A. Of these 156 shovel tests 32
were positive for cultural material. Seven of the 14
backhoe trenches were positive for cultural material.
Based on the results of the subsurface testing four
previously recorded archeological sites, 41WM1010,
41WM1012, 41WM1013, and 41TV1417, were found
to extend into the Additional Properties. In addition,
Sites 41WM1091 and 41TV2103 were discovered
within the Additional Properties. Only one of these
sites, 41WM1010, was recommended for NRHP
eligibility testing as a result of the survey. All six of
these sites were determined to be ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP as a result of survey and
testing investigations. Based on previous investi­
gations and coordination with TxDOT and the THC
it has been determined that the proposed SH 130
will have no effect upon significant historic properties
within the Additional Properties in Segment A.

Environmental Setting

local geomorphic process throughout the Holocene,
producing a thick sequence of mostly fine-grained
fluvial deposits. Yet a major late Holocene-His­
toric(?) flood, possibly that of 1921, deposited
coarse gravel across the southern portion of the
flood terrace and may have deposited fine-grained
sediment as far north as the southern part of the
Pleistocene(?) relict terrace.
Historic land use in the region has centered on
ranching and agriculture. Both of these activities
may potentially have impacted cultural deposits. In
the northern portion of Segment A, Queeny soils
are well drained and best suited for grazing, al­
though they have a relatively low yield capacity to
produce range forage. Houston Black clay, Oakalla
soils, and Sunev soils have a high yield capacity,
and are well suited for domesticated crops. Tradi­
tional crops in the region have consisted of cotton
and grain sorghum (Werchan and Coker 1983).
The project area lies within the Blackland Prairie
physiognomic region known as Silver Bluestem-Texas
Wintergrass Grassland (McMahan et. al. 1984).
Woody plants commonly associated with this region
include live oak and mesquite. Numerous grasses
include sideoats grama, Texas grama, tall dropseed,
and buffalograss. Historically, the vegetation of this
area was dominated by prairie grass and tree motts
(Telfair 1999). Poor agricultural practices of the nine­
teenth and early twentieth century have altered the
vegetation. Bunch grasses and forbs of higher nutri­
tional quality have been replaced by shorter-growing,
lesser quality species and domestic cultigens. Live
oak is abundant at the property margins and in the
riparian environment along creek crossings. Prairie
grass and weeds dominate the floodplains.
Segment A lies within a unique environmental
setting. Unlike the rest of central Williamson

Segment A lies within the Blackland Prairie
division of the Gulf Coastal Plains physiographic
province (Fenneman 1946; Ferguson 1986; Hatch
et al. 1990). Rivers and most large streams traverse
this region in a southeastward direction and have
low channel gradients. Major waterways intersected
in Segment A include the San Gabriel River and
one of its tributaries, Brushy Creek. Immediately
south of Georgetown, SH 130 intersects the San
Gabriel River. The topography of this area is char­
acterized by rounded uplands, which gently slope
to the San Gabriel River floodplain via numerous
small, dissected drainages. Small creeks such as
Pecan Branch function as ephemeral tributaries that
feed into the San Gabriel River. Buried archeologi­
cal sites are often found within the fluviatile depos­
its associated these regional drainages. In upland
areas, archeological sites are usually found atop of
the ground surface, due to erosion and the slow
nature of upland soil deposition.
In the Blackland Prairie, Brushy Creek is the
southernmost stream in the Brazos River basin and
flows very close to the major drainage divide be­
tween the Brazos and Colorado River watersheds.
Drainage divides separating large river systems are
usually the most ancient, stable landforms in a given
region. Brushy Creek and its influent streams in­
cised into this relict landform relatively recently.
Therefore, deposits reflecting long-term landscape
development may yet be preserved. Moderately
abrupt slopes separate the modern channel of Brushy
Creek, its flood plain, and flood terrace.
There are no gage records of historic flood
stages attained by Brushy Creek in this reach, but a
1921 flood probably inundated the entire SH 130
corridor within the Brushy Creek floodplain (Bomar
1995). Overbank deposition has been the dominant

County, where clayey soils dominate uplands, the
project area uplands are gravelly clay loam. The
project area extends along uplands immediately ad­
jacent to Dry Berry Creek and Berry Creek. It also
includes flood plain terraces for both of these
streams. This close proximity to water and riparian
fauna suggest the location may have been ideal for
prehistoric habitation. Silicious gravel is abundant
and readily available on the surface. The develop­
ment trend of the thin upland soils is erosional.
Evidence of prehistoric habitation would likely
manifest on the surface or in shallow upland depos­
its. In the floodplains of the creeks, the environ­
ment is depositional, although of modest depth.
The potential for intact, buried prehistoric deposits
seems greatest in these frequently inundated soils.
Properties with similar environmental conditions
within one kilometer of the current project area are
known to contain archeological deposits.
The southern portion of Segment A is located
in the dissected uplands of the Texas Blackland
Prairie, with elevations ranging from 540 to 600
feet AMSL. Deeply incised, meandering drainages
with terraced banks describes the region’s
morphology. These upland areas appear to be very
deflated due to agriculture and associated terracing.
The upland settings of the project area coupled
with crop and livestock agriculture suggests that
erosion in these areas has been severe and the
probability for buried cultural deposits is low. Some

residential and commercial development has
occurred along existing roadways within the project
area. It is possible that some or all of these present
day land use activities have impacted unrecorded
archeological deposits. In addition, the argillitur­
bation commonly associated with the clayey soils
would affect the integrity of cultural resources
located within the project area.
Segment A crosses six soil groups, as mapped
by Proctor et al. (1981). Beginning at the intersec­
tion of SH 130 and IH 35 in Georgetown, fluvia­
tile Pleistocene Terrace deposits and recent flood­
plain alluvium, generally consisting of silt and
clay, are found due to the close proximity of the
San Gabriel River. This is followed by an ap­
proximately 13.5 mile stretch of the alignment,
which is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous Aus­
tin Chalk formation. This formation is generally
chalk and marl, averaging about 85% calcium car­
bonate (Proctor et al. 1981). The remaining eight
miles, continuing south of Pfluger Lane to just
beyond US 290, fall within the Upper Cretaceous,
undivided Navarro and Taylor groups. These
groups consist of silty clays that transition to cal­
careous clays with depth. Although infrequent,
other soils encountered in Segment A include the
Eagle Ford and Buda Limestone groups. Shale,
limestone, and chalky marls that are traversed near
the San Gabriel River and Brushy Creek charac­
terize these Upper Cretaceous formations.

Research Design

b. that are associated with the lives of persons
significant in our past; or

This section presents the research design and
field methodology for the Phase I archeological
investigations of Segment A of the proposed SH
130 right-of-way. The archeological investigations
for Segment A were conducted between November
2002 and August 2005. These investigations con­
sisted of a phased approach through which portions
of the project could be coordinated with TxDOT
and the THC. Each phase of the investigation was
coordinated through impact evaluations and interim
reports. All investigations were conducted in ac­
cordance with the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended, and 36 CFR 800, the
Texas Antiquities Code (13 TAC 26), the Secretary
of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Ar­
chaeology and Historic Preservation (48 FR 4471644742), and the Secretary’s Standards for Identifi­
cation (48 FR 44720-44723), the Protocol for His­
toric Property Identification, Evaluation, and Treat­
ment for the SH 130 Project, the Programmatic
Agreement (PA) among the THC, the FHWA,
TxDOT, and the Advisory Council on Historic Pres­
ervation, and TAC #3000. All archeological depos­
its identified within the project area were evaluated
using the NRHP criteria of significance (36 CFR
60.4). The NRHP criteria are as follows:
The quality of significance in American his­
tory, architecture, archaeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and
objects of state and local importance that possess
integrity of location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feeling, and

c. that embody the distinctive characteristics of a
type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess
high artistic value, or that represent a signifi­
cant and distinguishable entity whose compo­
nents may lack individual distinction; or
d. that yielded, or may be likely to yield, infor­
mation on prehistory or history.
Criteria considerations: ordinarily cemeteries,
birthplaces, or graves of historical figures; proper­
ties owned by religious institutions or used for reli­
gious purposes; structures that have been moved
from their original locations, commemorative in
nature; and properties that have achieved their sig­
nificance within the past 50 years shall not be con­
sidered eligible for the NRHP (36 CFR 60.4)
Typically the most applicable criteria for evalu­
ating archeological properties is Criterion d. In gen­
eral, prehistoric and historic sites containing subsur­
face deposits in the form of features or middens that
are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP fall within
Criterion d. Sites that are viewed as likely to contain
intact subsurface deposits are determined by occupa­
tion intensity, function or type of site, and the degree
of disturbance. Site integrity and condition are key
factors in evaluating NRHP significance.
The investigations consisted of three levels of
investigation, background research, pre-survey im­
pact evaluations, and intensive survey. Testing in­
vestigations conducted in Segment A were con­
ducted under a separate permit. Essentially, Hicks
& Company would conduct background research

made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or

on the proposed Additional Properties to identify
previously recorded archeological sites and define
probability areas. The background research was fol­
lowed by a pre-survey field visit that was summa­
rized in an impact evaluation. Impact evaluations
included recommendations for survey or non-sur­
vey based on the results of the pre-survey field
investigations. Areas recommended for survey were
surveyed and summarized in an interim report and
submitted for review. LSI obtained right-of-entry
through a standardized right-of-entry letter. Parcels
were not investigated until receipt of a signed rightof-entry agreement. These levels of investigations
are explained in more detail below.

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Background research was conducted for all
Additional Properties prior to the pre-survey field­
work. Research was conducted at the Texas His­
torical Commission, the Texas Archeological Re­
search Laboratory, the University of Texas Center
for American History, and the Austin History Cen­
ter. In addition to these primary sources, background
information was obtained from Williamson County,
informants, and landowner interviews. The primary
goal of the background research was to identify
previously recorded archeological sites, potential
historic sites, cemeteries, and areas of high prob­
ability. This information was obtained through the
examination of site records, historic maps, aerial
photography, regional literature, and reports of pre­
vious investigations. All cultural resources within
one kilometer of the proposed SH 130 right-of-way
were documented and evaluated to establish a re­
gional context for sites within the project area. When
historic age resources were encountered during the
field investigations, additional background research,
consisting of a deeds and records search, would be
conducted for specific properties.
During the summer of 2003 Hicks & Company
held discussions with TxDOT over amending the
current TAC Permit #3000 to exclude low and
moderate probability areas from the investigation.
These probability areas were defined by PBS&J as
part of their survey investigations within the
proposed SH 130 right-of-way (Plates 6 through
10). High probability areas were established based
on their proximity to water sources and previously

recorded archeological sites. Low and moderate
probability areas were generally in upland areas,
not near water sources, and in areas where the
majority of the proposed SH 130 right-of-way had
been previously disturbed, such as along IH-35 and
US 290. Although, low and moderate probability
areas were excluded from coordination, Hicks &
Company was required under the Exclusive
Development Agreement to perform pre-survey
field visits to all parcels located within the
Additional Properties of the proposed SH 130 rightof-way. The permit amendment also granted the
Principal Investigator and TxDOT the right to make
recommendations for surveys in these areas if they
felt it was warranted. All high probability areas
were evaluated and coordinated with TxDOT and
the THC. The amendment to TAC Permit #3000
was approved on August 4, 2005 (Appendix B).

PRE-SURVEY IMPACT
EVALUATIONS
Following the background research, Hicks &
Company conducted pre-survey field visits to all
parcels within the Additional Properties of the pro­
posed SH 130 right-of-way. These field visits con­
sisted of a pedestrian reconnaissance of the prop­
erty, an evaluation of the geomorphology, visits to
previously recorded sites, investigations of poten­
tial historic properties, and photographic documen­
tation. No subsurface testing or artifact collection
was conducted during the pre-survey visits. The
results of the pre-survey investigations on Addi­
tional Properties within high probability areas were
summarized in a standardized impact evaluation
that included the summary of investigations, an
environmental overview (including soils, geology,
vegetation, and land use), a cultural history over­
view (including previously recorded sites, regional
history, and probability for sites), and conclusions
and recommendations. Each impact evaluation in­
cluded maps and photographs of the project area.
Impact evaluations were not completed for Addi­
tional Properties within low or moderate probabil­
ity areas unless the investigators or TxDOT deter­
mined a survey was warranted.
Impact evaluations provided recommendations
for survey and non-survey of the Additional
Properties within the proposed SH 130 right-of-way.

Parcels with Additional Properties recommended
for survey were reviewed by TxDOT and concur­
rence to proceed with intensive survey would be
relayed through electronic mail to Hicks & Company.
All parcels within high probability areas recom­
mended for non-survey were coordinated by TxDOT
with the THC. In general, areas recommended for
non-survey were areas that exhibited a low potential
for archeological sites and site preservation. These
areas were typically in uplands with shallow, deflated
soil, or areas with previous disturbance.

SURVEY INVESTIGATIONS
All survey investigations were conducted in ac­
cordance with the THC’s minimum survey standards.
The THC’s minimum survey standards for linear and
areal survey were applied based on the nature of the
property. Due to the nature of the Additional Proper­
ties, the linear survey method, consisting of 16 tests
per mile for every 100 feet of right-of-way width, was
the most common method applied. Hicks & Com­
pany utilized pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and
machine excavation to investigate the parcels with
Additional Properties recommended for intensive sur­
vey. Shovel tests were excavated in ten-centimeter
levels to one meter below ground surface, culturally
sterile soils, or bedrock. Sediment from the shovel
tests were screened through 1/4-inch mesh hardware
cloth. Observed data and soil profiles were recorded
on standardized shovel test forms. Shovel tests were
excavated in all areas recommended for survey and
within previously recorded and newly recorded sites.
In site areas, a minimum of six shovel tests would be
excavated to delineate the horizontal and vertical
extent of the site.
In areas where Holocene deposits were ex­
pected to extend below one meter below ground
surface, Hicks & Company utilized machine exca­
vated trenches to explore the deeper sediments.
These areas were located primarily along major
streams and tributaries with alluvial soils. Trenches
were typically 1.5 meters wide (along the center)
and five meters long and excavated to culturally
sterile soils or to the limit of the machine’s reach. A

sample of approximately 30 percent of the total
excavated sediment was screened through 1/4-inch
mesh hardware cloth. Soils within the trenches were
profiled and recorded on standardized backhoe
trench forms and photographed. In some cases,
when archeological deposits were encountered, 50
X 50 centimeter units were excavated within the
walls of the trenches to obtain better resolution on
the density and distribution of artifacts within the
site. These units were excavated in 10-centimeter
levels and all sediment screened through 1/4-inch
mesh hardware cloth. All trench excavations were
conducted in accordance with OSHA regulations,
the Trench Safety Specifications for the Archeo­
logical Investigation along Proposed SH 130
(Engineer’s Safety Plan), and supervised by a “Com­
petent Person” as defined in OSHA 1926.650(b).
Artifact collection was minimized during the
survey investigations. Since the survey investiga­
tions were conducted on privately owned land, LSI
secured right-of-entry agreements from the land­
owners prior to the investigations. These right-of­
entry agreements contained the stipulation that “any
archeological artifacts or cultural resources found
during the investigations will be retained by the
State of Texas at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory or other designated facility.” A “no col­
lection” policy was instituted in cases where land­
owners did not agree with this stipulation. For all
other properties where collection was permitted,
the following collection policy was followed. The
collection policy consisted of a collection of all
subsurface artifacts recovered from shovel tests,
test units, or machine excavations. Surface artifacts
were typically not collected with the exception of
diagnostic artifacts. In some cases, samples of sur­
face artifacts were collected for further analysis.
Collected artifacts were returned to the laboratory
facilities at Hicks & Company where they were
temporarily curated, washed, sorted, and catalogued.
Artifacts were subjected to a macroscopic inspec­
tion and identified according to material, manufac­
ture, and function. Upon acceptance of the final
report, all project related materials, including arti­
facts, photographs, field notes, etc., will be curated
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

CHAPTER 4
Cultural Background

within the Blackland Prairie to limited water supply
and the lack of large mammals such as bison and
pronghorn antelope (Shafer and Bryant 1976),
forcing the nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved
through this region on their seasonal migrations to
adhere to the waterways. However, cultural and
territorial forces must also be acknowledged. The
fact is, the Blackland prairie is located at the
intersection of several archeologically distinctive
culture areas—the hunter-gatherer burned rock
cultures of the west, the coastal groups to the east,
and the Caddoan tribes of the Post Oak Savannah/
Eastern Woodlands. One final explanation for the
low occurrence of prehistoric sites on the Blackland
Prairie is that many prehistoric archeological sites
were no doubt destroyed by farming and intensive
agricultural use of the Blackland Prairie during the
latter half of the nineteenth century.
Based on what is known about the prehistoric
environment it seems probable that prehistoric oc­
cupation of the Blackland Prairie would have re­
quired the utilization of both plateau and prairie
resources with considerable seasonal mobility be­
tween the two (Potter 2006; Ricklis and Collins
1994). Most of the occupation sites in the Black­
land Prairie represent short-term campsites in open,
unprotected areas situated on alluvial terraces adja­
cent to streams or rivers (Black 1989). Many cen­
tral Texas archeological sites located along the
larger waterways, such as the Colorado River, the
San Gabriel River, and Brushy Creek, have also
been deeply buried by Holocene alluvium (Johnson
2000). A typical open occupation site in central
Texas contains refuse such as chert flaking debris,
broken chert tools, fragmented burned rock, land
snails, fragmented animal bone and charred plant
remains within the context of a cooking facility

The archeological context of the SH 130
Segment A corridor includes both prehistoric and
historic archeological sites. A number of these are
considered significant with respect to Federal and
State statutes designed to protect archeological
resources. In this case, archeological significance is
defined as sites that are eligible for the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
The prehistoric cultures of central Texas are
defined as nomadic hunter-gatherers from the
Paleoindian until well into the historic period. Most
of the chronologies for central Texas are based on
four distinct time periods, representing a 12,000­
year sequence of occupation. This sequence from
Ricklis and Collins (1994) and Johnson (1995) is as
follows: Paleoindian (ca. 9200-6000 B.C.), Archaic
(6000 B.C.-A.D. 600), Post-Archaic (A.D. 6001600), and Historic (A.D. 1600-present). Although
these divisions represent arbitrary temporal catego­
ries, they are also based in large part on perceived
adaptations in subsistence, and are reflected in
changes in lithic and other technologies. Central
Texas is one of the better-known regions of the
state archeologically. More sites have been re­
corded, tested and excavated in this area than in
any other part of the State (Black 1989).
Segment A falls within the Blackland Prairie
archeological region, which is somewhat under­
represented in terms of prehistoric site density.
Intact prehistoric sites tend to be clustered along
first order streams, with only occasional minor sites
in between. It has been suggested that prehistoric
utilization of this region was intermittent, or
confined mainly to the riparian arteries along major
waterways (Brownlow 2003). Researchers have
tended to link the low archeological site density

29

30

Archeological Investigations of Segment A of Proposed State Highway 130

such as an oven or a stone hearth. An additional
characteristic of open sites is the presence of diag­
nostic stone tools, often representing occupations
from different periods or phases and ultimately sug­
gesting repeated use over hundreds or perhaps thou­
sands of years. Buried intact prehistoric occupation
sites are typically considered archeologically sig­
nificant when identified.
Lithic open sites, containing only the debris
from stone tool-making activities, are most fre­
quently found in upland areas and are often re­
ferred to as lithic procurement, quarry, or work­
shop sites. Numerous surveys conducted in the cen­
tral Texas area suggest that lithic sites are the most
common site type. The remains from such sites are
believed to be the result of specialized, short-term
activities, such as tool maintenance, tool manufac­
turing, or intensive chert resource procurement.
These sites most frequently are not well buried, and
often lack integrity. Sites of this type are not usu­
ally considered archeologically significant.
Another site type that is relatively uncommon
in the Blackland Prairie but frequently recorded for
the ecotonal region between the prairie and the
Edwards Plateau are burned rock middens. Burned
rock midden sites are considered to be characteris­
tic of central Texas archeology (Black 1989). These
fire-cracked and discolored limestone rock features
are found in terrace or upland settings and have
other cultural materials within and around them
indicating an open occupation site (Black 1989).
Burned rock middens are circular, mounded accu­
mulations some 10-25 meters across, having a ba­
sic annular (concentric) morphology (i.e., a dense
ring or rocks surrounding a distinct center and sur­
rounded by a thinning periphery; Black et al. 1997).
The wide variety of plant and animal remains found
within middens suggests that these ovens served as
communal plant and animal processing facilities.
Ultimately, it is believed that burned rock middens
are a consequence of perhaps hundreds of cooking
fires that were used and reused in one place over
many years (Black et al. 1997).
Burial sites are another class of prehistoric site
that could be present within the SH 130 alignment.
While burial sites are typically rare within the Black­
land Prairie (the Loeve-Fox Site-41WM230 is a
notable exception,), a number of them (41TV1198,
41TV88, and 41WM539) have been documented in
the ecotonal region between the prairie and Edwards

Plateau, and in the Interior Gulf Coastal Plain.
Within the ecotonal region prehistoric burials are
more likely to be one or two interments associated
with larger site occupations. Prehistoric cemeteries
(none have been documented in Guadalupe County
but many have been unearthed in neighboring coun­
ties to the south and east) with multiple interments
occur more frequently within the Interior Gulf
Coastal Plain region.
One final prehistoric site type that may occa­
sionally occur in the SH 130 alignment is the
rockshelter site. These are occupation sites that are
situated within shallow dry caves or rock overhangs.
These rock formations usually occur along creek or
stream bank margins. Rockshelter sites often con­
tain midden debris and abundant cultural material
that can include not only lithics, but faunal material,
seeds, pottery, and even the remains of basketry.
Within the SH 130 corridor, rockshelters are most
likely to occur along the western edge, where there
are a number of creeks bordered by high limestone
cliffs. Because faunal and plant material are often
well-preserved in rockshelter sites, if intact, these
are generally considered archeologically significant
for their inherent data value.
Within the entire project area, historical ar­
cheological sites are common. Settlement occurred
sporadically throughout the historic period. During
the Spanish Colonial period a number of expedi­
tions crossed into the SH 130 area, including ones
led by Domingo Teran and Fray Damian Mazanet
in 1691, Gregorio Salinas Varona in 1693, Domingo
Ramon in 1716, and the Marques de Aguayo in
1719-1722 (Robbins 1998). As the Spanish began
to establish presidios and missions within east and
northeast Texas they established the Camino Real
de los Tejas, the network of roads linking those
outposts to each other and, more importantly, to the
supply towns in Mexico. The Camino Real crossed
the Colorado River near Onion Creek in Austin and
ran in a northeasterly direction from there, crossing
Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River near the
SH 130 corridor.
More definitive settlement began during the
Mexican period starting in the 1820s. The earliest
tracts settled were Mexican period ranchos such as
that of Jose Antonio Navarro near present day Seguin.
In the 1830s, Anglo settlements sprang up at
Hornsby’s Bend on the Colorado, Montopolis on the
Colorado, Kenney’s Fort along Brushy Creek, Fort

Cultural Background 31

Colorado on Tannehill Creek, Austin, and Seguin.
However, most settlement prior to 1840 was hindered
by bad roads, poor supply networks, and frequent
Indian raids. One such raid took place on Kenny’s
Fort in 1840 (Scarbrough 1976). And one of the
largest fights between Indians and white settlers, the
Battle of Plum Creek, took place in 1840, partially
within the SH 130 corridor (Brice 1983). The battle
began approximately three miles southeast of
Lockhart and continued for approximately 15 miles
westward. That battle resulted in a decisive victory
for the white colonists that enabled them to push
settlement farther westward into the project area.
During the 1840s and 1850s towns such as
Lockhart, Round Rock, Manor, Martindale, and
Prairie Lea were established. These towns served
as regional centers for outlying plantations, farms
and ranches that began to spring up during the
latter half of the nineteenth century. During the
years prior to the Civil War, these farms tended to
be widely dispersed, based on early Mexican or
Republic of Texas era land grants (Mexican grants
were typically 4,428.4 acres, Republic of Texas
grants were typically 640 acres). However, the end
of slavery precipitated a new pattern of land owner­
ship and tenure, resulting in smaller farms operated
by single families or tenants (Britton et al. 2002;
O’Neal 1997). Many communities developed with
strong ethnic or cultural affiliations. For example,
toward the end of the nineteenth century a wave of
Swedish immigrants purchased land and began to
settle between Pflugerville and Webberville. Afri­
can American communities such as Turnersville
and Bluff Springs, southeast of Austin emerged.
The most common historic archeological site
type relates to homestead and tenant farm settle­
ment of the late nineteenth century. These sites
typically occur on hilltops or hill sides overlooking
creeks or springs. They generally contain one or
more combinations of foundation remnants, cis­
terns, wells, barns, and artifact scatters. Individu­
ally such sites are often not considered arche­
ologically significant; however, sites that contain
unusual features or complexes of historic farm­
steads representing vanished communities may be
archeologically significant.
Historic era cemeteries and family burial plots
are also fairly common. These sites do not always
contain grave markers, and if they do, mapped site
boundaries often inaccurately reflect the number of

interments. This is particularly true for Anglo family
cemeteries that contain pre-1870 interments. Often
these cemeteries contain unmarked burials of
African American slaves or servants.
Less common are sites pertaining to the Span­
ish Colonial Period, Mexican Period, early settle­
ment and military sites. These typically contain no
extant standing structures or features visible on the
surface. Such sites are almost always considered
archeologically significant, since limited historical
data about them exists.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS
Research conducted prior to Hicks & Company’s
field evaluation of the Additional Properties in Seg­
ment A of SH 130 identified 19 surveys conducted
within or in close proximity to the project corridor.
As a result of these surveys, 32 archeological sites
were recorded within the project alignment, as well
as numerous sites within a one-kilometer radius of
the project corridor. For the purpose of this report,
previously recorded sites and archeological surveys
will be discussed from north to south along the SH
130 corridor, and subdivided by geologic formations.
A summary of all previously recorded sites within the
SH 130 right-of-way is provided in Table 1.
Within the Pleistocene fluviatile terrace
deposits and recent floodplain alluvium that is
encountered in the San Gabriel River basin, between
Berry Creek to the north, and Mankins Branch
Creek to the south, nine surveys have contributed
to the identification of 11 archeological sites within
the SH 130 corridor. The northernmost of these
sites, 41WM917, was recorded by Espey, Huston
& Associates while conducting a linear survey for
the Gabriel-Glasscock 138-kV Transmission Line.
This site, located on the north side of FM 195, was
recorded as a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter with
late nineteenth to early twentieth century historic
debris. Due to a lack of potential for intact, buried
deposits, no further work was recommended for
the site. A subsequent visit during the initial phase
of SH 130 planning concurred with these recom­
mendations. This survey resulted in the identi­
fication of four additional sites (41WM914, 915,
916, 918), which are all outside of the current project
alignment. All of these sites are sparse, prehistoric

lithic scatters, with a historic component present on
41WM915. None of these sites were recommended
for further investigation.
Various surveys conducted between 1979 and
2002 have identified an additional eight archeo­
logical sites within 1000 meters of the SH 130
corridor (41WM17, 41WM378, 41WM379,
41WM430, 41WM1030, 41WM991, 41WM1044,
and 41WM735). All of these sites are identified as
lithic procurement sites or surficial lithic scatters
with no subsurface deposition. Although the sur­
vey areas often traversed spans of several kilome­
ters, all sites in this area were located near creeks
or creek drainages. This pattern of open sites adja­
cent to waterways is typical of prehistoric sites in
central Texas (Black 1989).
The remaining ten sites that fall within the SH
130 corridor in this alluvial formation were recorded
as a result of PBS&J’s initial investigation of SH
130, Segment A. Sites 41WM1021, 41WM1020, and
41WM1016 were recorded as upland lithic

procurement sites. No further work was recom­
mended on any of these sites due to surficial, or
very shallow artifact deposition. At Pecan Branch
Creek, prehistoric lithic procurement site 41WM1013
was recommended for additional testing of Parcel
30, on the north side of the creek; however, further
testing recovered no artifacts deeper than 10
centimeters below ground surface. Between Pecan
Branch and the San Gabriel River, one prehistoric
lithic procurement site (41WM1015) and one small
historic scatter (41WM1011) were recorded, but not
recommended for further testing due to shallow soils.
Located in the floodplain, immediately north
of the San Gabriel River, Site 41WM1012 was
recorded as a subsurface, prehistoric lithic scatter,
with three pieces of chert debitage between 10 and
40 centimeters below ground surface. At this time,
PBS&J recommended NRHP eligibility testing
based on a potential for deep Holocene sediments.
Test excavations, including mechanical trenching
on the site, uncovered a limestone hearth feature

Cultural Background 33

between 62 and 70 centimeters below ground
surface, which contained charcoal and Rabdotus
snail shells (Dixon et al. 2003). Site 41WM1012
was determined to be eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP following the testing investigations. In 2004,
PBS&J conducted data recovery investigations at
Site 41WM1012. During these investigations, a total
of 15 cultural features were encountered, “including
three cobble hearths, four ash pits, and the remains
of four bison” (Rogers and Dixon 2006). Radiocar­
bon dates of approximately A.D. 1650-1800 were
obtained from wood charcoal associated with a
cluster of bison bone. This date temporally places
the site within the proto-historic period (Rogers
and Dixon 2006).
The remaining three archeological sites encoun­
tered within this recent alluvial setting are located
to the south of the San Gabriel River. Two of these
were recorded by PBS&J immediately south of the
river. Prehistoric lithic debitage was recovered from
shovel testing at both Sites 41WM1023 and
41WM1024. However, while artifacts were recov­
ered to a depth of 80 centimeters below ground
surface on Site 41WM1023, cultural deposition did
not extend below 10 centimeters below ground sur­
face on 41WM1024. Due to these results, further
testing was recommended to explore the potential
for more deeply buried cultural deposits at
41WM1023. The final site that has been recorded
within this alluvial formation is located approxi­
mately 1000 feet south of SH 29, along an un­
named tributary of Mankins Branch Creek. Site
41WM1046 is a 30,000 square meter prehistoric
lithic scatter, recorded in 2002 as a result of
PBS&J’s SH 130 survey investigations. A total of
28 shovel tests were excavated, none of which were
positive for cultural material. Due to extensive dis­
turbance and a lack of contextual integrity, the site
was not recommended for further investigation.
As the SH 130 corridor continues south, it rises
in elevation and crosses into an approximately 13.5
mile stretch that is underlain by the Upper Creta­
ceous Austin Chalk formation. According to avail­
able records, four archeological surveys that inter­
sect or are in close proximity to this portion of Seg­
ment A have been conducted, in addition to PBS&J’s
SH 130 investigations. Twelve previously recorded
archeological sites are found here within the SH 130
alignment. Only one of these sites resulted from
investigations prior to PBS&J’s survey.

Site 41WM819 was recorded in 1995 by Espey,
Huston and Associates’ survey of Pflugerville
138KV North Loop Line 14819-13 (Skokan 1995).
The site is described as a prehistoric lithic procure­
ment site with non-diagnostic prehistoric ceramics,
and is located on the north side of SH 79, approxi­
mately 500 feet west of FM 685. No further investi­
gation was recommended due to an apparently brief
occupation of the site. Three additional sites, which
are located near the SH 130 right-of-way, were
documented as a part of this survey. Site 41WM820,
which falls approximately 350 meters to the east of
the SH 130 alignment, is described as a very small
prehistoric site consisting of three pieces of chert
debitage on the surface. No further investigation
was recommended.
Sites 41TV1742 and 41TV1743 are late nine­
teenth to early twentieth century homesteads of the
Bohls family, who are associated with the Henry
Pfluger family. A cut limestone cistern, root cellar,
and a windmill remain on Site 41TV1742. Addi­
tional investigation, including archival research was
recommended for this site only if future construc­
tion was to impact remaining features. Just to the
south of this site, 41TV1743 consists of a bricklined well with cement casing. The structure that
was once associated with the well was moved some
time after 1937, limiting the research value of the
site. Due to the lack of this archeological compo­
nent, no further work was recommended. Pfluger­
ville’s earliest settler, Henry Pfluger, was part of
the initial wave of German immigration. Pfluger
settled in what would become Pflugerville in 1849,
although the town was not founded until 1860, and
did not develop significantly until after the Civil
War (Smyrl 2002). The first Bohls to the area,
William Bohls, immigrated to the United States
from Germany in 1842. He arrived in the Austin/
Pflugerville area in the early 1850s, marrying Henry
Pfluger’s daughter Catherine in 1852 (Mellenbruch
1963). William Bohls founded the town of
Pflugerville in 1860 when he opened a general store
and post office in his home, naming it in honor of
Henry Pfluger (Austin History Center 2003).
Of the 11 sites recorded by PBS&J, six are
historic homestead and dump sites, four are pre­
historic, and one has both prehistoric and historic
components. As could be predicted, based on
observed settlement patterns in the area, all of the
prehistoric sites are adjacent to waterways, whereas

34

Archeological Investigations of Segment A of Proposed State Highway 130

the historic sites are found on hilltops and prairies,
further removed from the drainageways.
The two northernmost sites within this geo­
logical formation, 41WM1018 and 41WM1019, are
located in very close proximity to one another, on
opposite banks of Mankins Branch Creek. Site
41WM1018 is a surficial scatter of historic and
prehistoric artifacts located on the western bank.
Two of 19 shovel tests excavated on this site were
positive for cultural material within the first five
centimeters. Due to a lack of stratigraphic integrity,
no further testing was recommended for this site.
On the east bank of Mankins Branch, Site
41WM1019 is another multi-component, historic
and prehistoric site. Cultural deposition was re­
corded to 40 centimeters below ground surface,
with most material originating from the upper ten
centimeters. Historic artifacts recovered from shovel
testing indicate a probable late-nineteenth to earlytwentieth century occupation. Again, due to a lack
of stratigraphic integrity, no further investigation
was recommended for Site 41WM1019.
The next two sites to the south (41WM1025
and 41WM1014) are recorded as historic scatters,
one of which is very obviously a dumpsite. Both
sites are confined to the surface with no deposition,
and no contextual integrity. No further investiga­
tion was recommended for either site. Approxi­
mately 1,750 meters south of 41WM1014, Site
41WM1022 is a light lithic scatter located near a
small, intermittent Brushy Creek drainage. No posi­
tive shovel tests were recorded on this site. All
artifacts were observed on the surface of a plowed
field with evidence of extensive erosion. Although
it was noted that more significant cultural deposits
could exist outside of the right-of-way, no further
investigation was recommended for Site 41TV1022.
Following this same Brushy Creek tributary drain­
age nearly four kilometers south, Site 41WM1017
is a small historic homestead and dumpsite. Recov­
ered artifacts appear to be related to early twentieth
century farming and ranching activities. Because
the site is on the surface, with very little deposition,
no further investigation was recommended.
The most significant previously recorded site
within Segment A of the SH 130 right-of-way is Site
41WM1010. This site is located on the north side of
Brushy Creek and is traversed by the tributary
drainage mentioned above. PBS&J conducted data
recovery investigations at Site 41WM1010 from

November through December 2002. Three distinct
spatial components of prehistoric remains, Areas
A/B, D North, and D South, were investigated,
revealing a total of 76 archeological features. Insitu chronological indicators in the form of
diagnostic artifacts (Darl, Scallorn projectiles) and
wood charcoal indicate a Late Archaic II (Uvalde/
Driftwood Phases), through Post-Archaic Austin
Interval occupation that is well preserved in several
areas of the site (Dixon et al. 2003b). The NRHP/
SAL eligibility of 41WM1010 appears to be based
on the presence of stratigraphically isolated, buried
Late Archaic II/Transitional and Post Archaic
prehistoric components, located in different site
areas. Relatively isolated, intact, well-preserved
occupations that span the transition period from
Late Archaic II through the Austin Interval, are
infrequent in the central Texas archeological record.
Such occupations typically exhibit excellent
potential for behavioral reconstruction and new
archeological data.
Approximately 100 meters south of Brushy Creek,
41WM1026 was encountered in a backhoe trench at
approximately 30-50 centimeters below ground sur­
face. Artifacts recovered at the site include burned
limestone cobbles and chert debitage. Because the
recovery efforts were limited to one backhoe trench,
the size of 41WM1026 is unknown. Due to lack of
stratigraphic integrity and density of cultural deposi­
tion, no further investigation was recommended.
The last three sites that are found atop the Up­
per Cretaceous Austin Chalk formation are located
between six to eight kilometers south of Brushy
Creek. Sites 41TV1975, 41TV1978, 41TV1976 are
all twentieth-century historic sites. Both Sites
41TV1975 and 41TV1978 were recorded as a mid
to late twentieth-century homesteads, based on wind­
mills, brick-lined cisterns, and artifacts recovered
no deeper than 30 centimeters below ground sur­
face. It was recommended that records be researched
to determine the relationship between the windmills
and brick-lined cisterns on both sites. Site 41TV1976
is an early twentieth-century dumpsite containing
bottle glass, building hardware, domestic ceramics,
cast iron stove fragments, miscellaneous fasteners,
and unidentified objects. No further investigation of
Site 41TV1976 was recommended.
Only two additional sites are located within
one kilometer of the SH 130 right-of-way along
this 13.5 mile stretch, both north of SH 79. Site

Cultural Background 35

41WM835 is a multi-generation farmstead, identi­
fied in 1996 by Antiquities Planning and Consult­
ing as a result of reconnaissance efforts for the
proposed Weathery Private Housing Development
(Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Online 1996).
Occupation of the property ranges from the late
1800’s until the mid 1950’s, based on the artifact
assemblage and dates inscribed in features. Addi­
tional archival research was recommended for this
site. Site 41WM1087 is an early to mid-twentieth
century home site that was identified by Archaeo­
logical and Cultural Sciences Group (ACSG) in
2003 (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Online
2003). The site consists of the remains of a shotgun
style, board-and-batten siding house with a corru­
gated metal roof and brick and cement chimney.
The building had collapsed completely by the time
of inspection, with the exception of the chimney
foundation. Artifacts consist of glass containers,
shoes, and shoe soles, aluminum, sheet metal, doll
parts, soft drink cans, a BF Goodrich tire and a
1959 automobile license plate. This site was to be
destroyed by construction of the Hutto Bypass, and
no further investigation was recommended.
Immediately south of Sites 41TV1742 and
41TV1743, near the SH 130/Pfluger Lane intersec­
tion, the alignment enters the Upper Cretaceous,
undivided Navarro and Taylor groups, the final geo­
logical formation found within Segment A. Within
these eight remaining miles, five archeological sur­
veys have identified nine sites within the SH 130
corridor and four sites that are within one kilometer
of the project area. Of the four sites located outside
of the SH 130 right-of-way, only one (Site
41TV1739) is prehistoric. Espey, Huston and As­
sociates recorded this site in 1995, near an un­
named tributary of Gilleland Creek, while survey­
ing the McNeil-Bastrop 138-kV transmission line
(Nash et al. 1995). At the time this site was re­
corded, it was reported to be a heavily disturbed
surface scatter of prehistoric lithic debitage and
tools. No subsurface artifacts were recovered from
four shovel tests excavated on the site and no fur­
ther investigation was recommended.
The other three sites that are located within one
kilometer of the SH 130 corridor are all historic sites
recorded by Lone Star Archeological Services
(LSAS). The northern-most of these sites, 41TV1328,
is located on the south bank of Harris Branch, an
intermittent Gilleland Creek tributary. This site was

recorded in 1987 as a result of investigations for
the Harris Branch Wastewater Interceptor (Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas 1987). A hand-dug, stonelined well with a brick cap was the only feature
recorded and no artifacts were observed in the area.
Because it is possible that flood deposits have bur­
ied artifacts, investigators recommended archival
research and additional testing. No other sites were
recorded on this project.
Near the southern terminus of Segment A, Sites
41TV1415 and 41TV1416 were recorded by LSAS
in 1988 and 1989 (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
Online 1989) during a survey of the Harris Branch
Development. Site 41TV1416 is a scatter of brick
and artifacts dating from the 1880’s through 1930’s,
which lies just west of the SH 130 alignment. This
scatter marks the location of a house occupied by
tenant farmers. Other structures located nearby had
been removed sometime prior to 1945, when
Marjorie Glass Nagle moved to the property. Inves­
tigators recommended archeological testing of the
site, including remote sensing for sub-surface fea­
tures if the site was subject to machine clearing.
Approximately 700 meters to the west of this site is
41TV1415. Dating to the same time period as Site
41TV1416, Site 41TV1415 is a collapsed farm­
house with associated outbuildings, cisterns, and a
possible well. Investigators estimated the site to be
approximately 15% intact at the time of survey.
Site recommendations included site mapping and
monitoring for sub-surface features during machine
clearing of the area.
Two other sites were recorded by LSAS as a
result of this survey, Sites 41TV1414 and
41TV1417. Site 41TV1414 is a prehistoric lithic
procurement site located on the surface (Texas Ar­
cheological Sites Atlas n.d.). This site is over one
kilometer west of the SH 130 alignment. No further
work was recommended. Site 41TV1417 is one of
two sites in this eight-mile stretch of SH 130 rightof-way that was recorded prior to PBS&J’s investi­
gations. The original recording of Site 41TV1417
reported several wood piers and large, flat lime­
stone rocks that marked the location of tenant
houses. Artifacts included ironstone, crockery, bottle
glass, and a cast iron meat grinder. Subsequent
visits to the site by PBS&J in 2001 and 2003 re­
ported a surface scatter of prehistoric debitage,
tested cobbles, and historic debris (Texas Archeo­
logical Sites Atlas 1988, 2001, 2003). No further

36

Archeological Investigations of Segment A of Proposed State Highway 130

investigation was recommended for Site 41TV1417.
Approximately 400 meters south of Gregg Road,
Site 41TV1893 is an historic trash scatter recorded
by LCRA archeologists in 1999. The site was highly
disturbed and did not appear represent the location
of a house. Although household debris was widely
dispersed, both vertically and horizontally, the sec­
ondary nature of the site did not warrant further
investigation (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
1999). PBS&J revisited Site 41TV1893 in 2001, by
which time the site had been destroyed by the con­
struction of a substation (Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas 2001).
The seven remaining sites that are found within
the SH 130 right-of-way were recorded by PBS&J
as a result of SH 130 investigations. All of these are
historic-age sites, including one with a prehistoric
component. Sites 41TV1969 and 41TV1970 are lo­
cated on opposite sides of Wilbarger Creek, north of
Pflugerville Road. 41TV1969 is a scatter of prehis­
toric lithics and early twentieth-century debris, with
no subsurface deposition. Site 41TV1970, on the
south bank of Wilbarger Creek, was recorded as an
historic homestead, consisting of numerous ceramic
and glass fragments. Artifacts were found to a depth
of 10 centimeters below the surface near a standing
structure of unspecified age. A fence and agricul­
tural structure of unknown age were also present at
the site. No further investigation was recommended
for either site due to the lack of deposition.
Approximately 1,400 meters south, down the
right-of way from these sites is Site 41TV1971.
This site consists of a twentieth century, boardand-batten fashion house with a modern sheet metal
roof, trash dump and surface scatter of historic arti­
facts. The site was originally recorded by PBS&J in
2001, and was revisited by Blanton and Associates
in 2003 (Young et al. 2003). Neither firm recom­
mended further investigation of this site. Another
historic homestead was recorded by PBS&J ap­
proximately 800 meters south of Site 41TV1971.

Site 41TV1973 consists of house remnants, a
brick-lined well with plaster, a windmill and berm.
It was estimated that 10% of the site remained
intact following disturbance due to plowing, recent
demolition, and large subsurface disturbance. Ar­
chival research was recommended for this site.
Along the eastern edge of the SH 130 right-of-way,
Site 41TV1972 is located approximately two kilo­
meters south of the Site 41TV1973 location. A 5 x
5 meter concrete foundation, large metal cistern,
and tin roof remains were found here with
whiteware and glass fragments on the surface. The
structural remnants, believed to belong to an agri­
cultural shed, are of minimal importance and inves­
tigators recommended no further work.
Site 41TV1977 is an historic scatter of domes­
tic debris located on the north side of Gilleland
Creek. Artifacts collected from the site include glass,
ceramics, a spoon, and a shell button. It was not
determined whether or not a brick-lined cistern
found to the north of the site center was associated
with the scatter. Due to a thin deposit of artifacts
that are not historically significant, no further in­
vestigation was recommended. Approximately 500
meters south of this site, on the opposite side of
Gilleland Creek, is the final site recorded by PBS&J
in Segment A. Site 41TV1974 is an historic midden,
and brick-lined cistern full of domestic trash and
farm implements. Artifacts observed and/or col­
lected include ceramics, marble, porcelain, glass,
metal, and farming equipment. Additional archival
research was recommended for Site 41TV1974.
As evidenced by previous investigations in the
vicinity of the SH 130 right-of-way, very little po­
tential exists for buried archeological sites outside
of the floodplains of major waterways. With the
exception of sites near the San Gabriel River and
Brushy Creek, the overwhelming majority of previ­
ously recorded archeological sites in this area are
surficial, or very shallowly buried historic scatters
with very little historic significance.

for construction. This date represents the date of
coordination with the THC. The archeological inves­
tigations for Segment A are complete and have been
coordinated with TxDOT and the THC. Agency co­
ordination letters for all of Segment A are included in
Appendix B. Construction of the proposed SH 130 is
currently underway and the results of the investiga­
tions within the Additional Properties in Segment A
are summarized below by segment.

Following the approval of the FEIS and the
selection of a preferred alternative, Segment A was
divided into two segments, Segments 1 and 2. These
segments were further divided into sections. Seg­
ment 1 was divided into Sections 1 to 4 and Seg­
ment 2 was divided into Sections 5 to 10. The
length of the segments and sections were selected
primarily based on design and construction issues.
Parcel numbers were assigned to each property tra­
versed by the highway. As stated previously, Hicks
& Company’s investigations were limited to the
Additional Properties, additional right-of-way added
subsequent to the FEIS. The Additional Properties
in Segment A overlap a total of 240 parcels.
On September 4, 2003, TAC Permit #3000 was
amended to exclude from coordination, Additional
Properties that are located within low or moderate
probability areas, as defined by PBS&J (Plates 6 to
10). This amendment to the permit excluded 140
parcels from coordination, with the exception that,
parcels with previously recorded archeological sites
or those parcels deemed to have a high probability
for archeological sites to occur, could be surveyed
at the recommendation of the Principal Investigator
or TxDOT. Although these parcels were excluded
from coordination, Hicks & Company conducted
pre-survey investigations of these parcels in accor­
dance with the Exclusive Development Agreement
with Lone Star Infrastructure. Parcel 169 is the
only parcel surveyed that was located within a low
or moderate probability area. This parcel was sur­
veyed at the request of TxDOT since it represented
an unusually large tract (17.7 acres).
To accommodate the construction schedule, the
investigations utilized a phased approach to clear
individual sections. The parcels listed on Table 4 in
Appendix A, indicate the date each parcel was cleared

SEGMENT 1
Segment 1 begins at IH-35 just north of the
intersection of SH 195 and IH-35 in Williamson
County. It continues south along IH-35 until
branching off to the south just south of Berry Creek.
The terminus of Segment 1 is located just north of
US 79, near the town of Hutto in Williamson
County. The highway traverses several waterways,
including Dry Berry Creek, Berry Creek, Pecan
Branch, the San Gabriel River, and Mankins Branch.
There are also several unnamed tributaries and
minor streams within Segment 1. As stated in the
research design, several parcels were eliminated
from the field investigation based on their location
within low or moderate probability areas and not
coordinated with TxDOT-ENV or the THC.
Although every Additional Property was submitted
to a pre-survey investigation, only those parcels in
high probability areas were formally coordinated in
an Impact Evaluation. The parcels in low or
moderate probability areas were formally coordi­
nated with TxDOT and the THC on September 4,
2003 (Appendix B). A total of 65 parcels, within
high probability areas, were investigated in Segment
1 between July 14, 2003 and June 22, 2005. All of

37

38

Archeological Investigations of Segment A of Proposed State Highway 130

these parcels were subjected to pre-survey
investigations and the results submitted in an impact
evaluation. Of the 65 parcels, 35 were determined
to have a low probability for archeological sites
and were recommended for no additional arche­
ological investigations. The remaining 30 parcels
were recommended for intensive survey. The
parcels in Segment A are listed in Table 2.
Clearance is indicated by a date representing the
date of coordination with the THC.
The 35 parcels in Segment 1 that were deter­
mined to have a low probability for archeological
sites to occur, were typically located in upland areas
or areas of previous disturbance (Figures 1 & 2).
There were no archeological sites previously recorded
on these properties. In general, these areas exhibited
shallow, deflated soils, exposed bedrock, and/or dis­
turbance from previous development and agricul­
tural use. Agricultural disturbance in the project area
was often limited to plowing and grazing, which
contribute to increased erosion (Figure 3). How­
ever, the investigators often encountered terraced
fields used to control erosion. This terracing within
the shallow upland soils would result in the loss of
any intact archeological deposits (Figure 4).
Survey investigations in Segment 1 occurred
in areas adjacent to streams, previously recorded
archeological sites, and areas determined to have
a high probability for sites to occur based on the
pre-survey investigations. The results of survey
are presented from north to south starting with
Section 1 and ending with Section 3. All of Sec­
tion 4 is located within low and moderate prob­
ability areas as defined by PBS&J and was not
surveyed or coordinated.
The properties within Section 1 were surveyed
at different times beginning with Parcels 202 and 5.
The survey was conducted utilizing a pedestrian
survey supplemented by shovel tests in areas of
low surface visibility; backhoe trenches were exca­
vated in areas suspected of having deep Holocene
alluvial deposits. It was recommended in the presurvey report that Parcels 202 and 5 be investigated
with a backhoe due to the heavy gravel overburden
covering the property, making shovel testing im­
possible. This property is located on the north side
of Dry Berry Creek and is situated within Oakalla
soils, which are alluvial in origin. Based on the
proximity to the creek and the nature of the soils it
was the opinion of Hicks & Company archeologists

that the area would have a high probability for
buried archeological deposits. A total of two back­
hoe trenches were excavated on the property. The
first trench 202BHT-1 was excavated from south to
north approximately 70 meters north of Dry Berry
Creek. The soils in this trench were completely
disturbed to a depth of 240 centimeters below
ground surface (limit of excavation). Trench
202BHT-2 was excavated approximately 60 meters
north of the first trench to depth of 230 centimeters
below ground surface. A subsequent conversation
with the landowner revealed that the entire property
had been used as a county gravel pit approximately
25 years ago. All soils within both of the trenches
consisted of unsorted sandy, silty, clays mixed with
gravels, cobbles, asphalt, and large boulders.
Trenches were excavated down to the underlying
bedrock and no intact soils were encountered. Based
on the conversation with the current landowner and
the results of the two backhoe trenches, additional
investigations were abandoned at the property. No
archeological deposits were encountered during the
survey of Parcels 202 and 5.
A total of 18 shovel tests and six backhoe
trenches were excavated within Parcels 1105, 1101,
and 16 on the north and south sides of Berry Creek.
This area is divided into three main terraces north
of Berry Creek and one high terrace on the south
side of Berry Creek. All of the terraces correspond
to the distribution of the mapped soil units across
the three parcels. Shovel testing was conducted over
all three terraces and backhoe trenches were con­
ducted on the lowest terrace adjacent to Berry Creek
and at the transition to the next higher terrace to the
north. Shovel tests were excavated to between 35
and 100 centimeters below the ground surface to a
dense gravelly clay zone. Of the 18 shovel tests,
seven were positive for cultural material. Four of
the positive tests were located on the high terrace
adjacent to Market Street in Parcel 1105 (Figure
5). The remaining three positive shovel tests were
located on the intermediate terrace above the Berry
Creek floodplain in Parcel 1101. On the high ter­
race in Parcel 1105 one piece of debitage was iden­
tified in each of the four tests at depths of 0 to 10
centimeters below ground surface, 10 to 20 centi­
meters below ground surface, and 50 to 60 centi­
meters below ground surface. Two shovel tests on
the next terrace south in Parcel 1101 produced one
piece of debitage and a chert core, each between 10

and 20 centimeters below ground surface, and the
third shovel test contained two pieces of debitage
between 0 to 10 centimeters below ground surface
and 10 to 20 centimeters below ground surface.
Soils within Parcel 1105 are mapped within
Sunev silty clay loam and observations consisted of
an upper 10YR3/2 silty clay loam zone followed by
a 10YR4/3 silty clay loam with few chert and
limestone gravels. An additional 13 shovel tests
were excavated further to the south within Parcel
1101. Soils within Parcel 1101 transition from
Houston Black clay in the north to Sunev silty clay
loam to the frequently flooded Oakalla soils adjacent
to Berry Creek. The observed soils in the north

portion of Parcel 1101 consisted of 10YR3/1 silty
clay loam overlying a friable 10YR3/4 silty clay
loam. Shovel tests terminated at a dense gravelly
zone ranging from 35 to 52 centimeters in depth.
Moving further south within Parcel 1101, soils are
less defined consisting of one zone of 10YR3/1
silty clay loam. The dense gravelly zone in these
areas was encountered between 50 and 80
centimeters below ground surface, with gravels
scattered throughout (Werchan and Coker 1983).
Three backhoe trenches were excavated in the
southern portion of Parcel 1101 near Berry Creek
within the Oakalla frequently flooded soils. This
area near Berry Creek appears to be very deflated.

Figure 5. Sketch map of survey areas along Berry Creek and Site 41WM1091.

Two trenches, 1101BHT-1 and 1101BHT-2,
encountered a 10YR3/1 silty clay loam plow zone
in the upper portion of the trenches. Sandy gravels
were observed at approximately 30 centimeters
below ground surface and sandy loam with large
cobbles and boulders between 70 and 190
centimeters below ground surface (Figure 6). The
soils within this area extending south to Berry Creek
consist primarily of high velocity alluvial deposits

evidenced by the dense gravels and sands. One
flake was found in 1101BHT-1 in the upper 20
centimeters of soil (plow zone) and four flakes and
a small piece of charcoal were found in 1101BHT2 at a depth of 145 to 155 centimeters below ground
surface within a dense sand and gravel zone. Based
on the associated soil matrix the artifacts occurred
in, it is likely these artifacts have been displaced
from their primary context by high velocity flood

deposition. Trench 1101BHT-1 was terminated
at 126 centimeters below ground surface and 1101
BHT-2 was terminated at 190 centimeters below
ground surface when bedrock was encountered
in both trenches. 1101BHT-3 exhibited soils more
consistent with the Houston Black clay. No
cultural material was encountered in 1101BHT3, which terminated at limestone bedrock between
142 and 158 centimeters below ground surface.
No cultural features or evidence of intact cultural
deposits were observed in any of the trenches on
the north side of Berry Creek. A total of 13 artifacts
were identified at the site within the shovel tests
and backhoe trenches.
Overall the distribution of artifacts is very low
density. The shallower artifacts identified in five of
the shovel tests and 1101BHT-1 within the top 30
centimeters of sediments have been impacted by
previous plowing activities and are not in their origi­
nal context. The site has been assigned the trino­
mial 41WM1091 (Figure 5).
On the south side of Berry Creek, in Parcel 16,
three additional backhoe trenches were excavated.
The south bank of Berry Creek is higher in eleva­
tion than the north bank in Parcel 1101 and ends
abruptly in a steep cut bank descending down to the

creek. The northern portion of Parcel 16 is mapped
within the Oakalla frequently flooded soils and the
cut bank appeared to have Holocene age deposits
evident in profile (Figure 7). The first backhoe
trench, 16BHT-1, was opened about 25 meters south
of Berry Creek. Soils within 16BHT-1 consisted of
a 10YR2/2 silty clay plow zone overlying a 10YR4/
3 silty clay with numerous gravels and massive
cobbles ranging in size from one centimeter to 45
centimeters in diameter. Underlying the gravelly
zone is a 7.5YR4/4 silty clay loam with a notice­
able decrease in gravels followed by a 10YR7/4
clayey silt with few or no gravels. The trench ter­
minated in a dense gravelly zone between 165 and
179 centimeters below ground surface. It is likely
the upper zone of gravel and large cobbles is the
result of Pleistocene alluviation, which is consis­
tent with the surface geology of the area. There­
fore, it is unlikely that any cultural deposits would
be identified within this zone. Furthermore, intact
cultural deposits would not be found in the active
plow zone and would most likely be evident on
the surface. Two additional trenches, 16BHT-2
and 16BHT-3, were excavated and exhibited the
same profile as 16BHT-1. No cultural material was
observed in any of the trenches within Parcel 16.

Figure 7. Cut bank on the south bank of Berry Creek at Parcel 16
looking southeast from Berry Creek. Note the deposition above gravel.

Shovel testing was not conducted within Parcel 16
due to the low probability for intact buried cul­
tural deposits.
A survey, in the form of shovel testing, was
conducted on Parcels 28, 30, 31, 35 and 36. Site
41WM1013 extends across portions of Parcels 28,
30, and 31 within the proposed SH 130 EDA rightof-way (Figure 8). Prior to shovel testing, the
boundaries of 41WM1013 did not overlap the cur­
rent project area. No artifacts were recovered from
the one shovel test placed on Parcel 31. Four shovel
tests were excavated on Parcel 28, however only
one shovel test recovered fragments of prehistoric

lithic debitage at depths less than 35 centimeters
below ground surface. Seven out of 15 shovel tests
conducted on Parcel 30 encountered prehistoric
lithic debitage and/or historic ceramics less than 35
centimeters below ground surface. Although this
information expands the current site boundaries of
Site 41WM1013, these subsurface artifacts are not
significant because they have been disturbed and
redeposited from routine contour plowing and other
ranching activities. Based upon this data Hicks &
Company recommended these new extensions of
41WM1013 lack the criteria required for NRHP
eligibility and SAL status.

Archeological Investigations of Segment A of Proposed State Highway 130

Site 41WM1012 is situated within 100 meters
of the Parcel 35 and 36 Additional Properties but
does not overlap the current project area. 41WM1012
has been deemed NRHP eligible and was subjected
to data recovery. No artifacts were recovered from
six shovel tests placed in Parcel 36. Seven shovel
tests were excavated on Parcel 35 and only one
shovel test encountered a fragment of prehistoric
lithic debitage from 35 centimeters below ground
surface. This positive shovel test was excavated in a
plowed field that is located within the modern flood
zone of the San Gabriel River. The lithic debitage
found in this shovel test is not significant because its
depositional context is questionable due to modern
plowing practices and flood events. In addition, the
western edge of the right-of-way, including the Ad­
ditional Property, in this area has been previously
quarried for gravel. Based upon this data, 41WM1012
does not extend into the project area and will not be
impacted by construction activities on the Parcel 35
and 36 Additional Properties.
A modern cemetery is located within 100
meters of Additional Properties located alongside
FM 971 and Parcel 1120. Hicks & Company vis­
ited the cemetery and spoke with cemetery per­
sonnel to establish that burials related to the cem­
etery do not extend into the SH 130 project area.
Hicks & Company historian John Clark spoke with
Ralph Love, curator of the Genealogy and Local
History section of the Georgetown Public Library,
who stated that the cemetery dates to the 1970s St.
Helen’s Catholic Church. It is the successor to the
fully occupied Guadalupe Cemetery and is only
partially full. Ralph Love also acknowledged that
that the likelihood of graves extending outside the
cemetery is very low because the local funeral
home is compliant with strict funerary statutes.
Furthermore, a visit to the cemetery established
that there is a 75-meter (approximately 250 feet)
wide strip of undeveloped land separating the cem­
etery from the shoulder of FM 971. This land
buffer further significantly decreases the likeli­
hood of burials extending into Additional Proper­
ties adjacent to FM 971.

SEGMENT 2
Segment 2 begins just north of US 79, near the
town of Hutto in Williamson County. It continues

south across Brushy Creek and follows FM 685
until just north of the town of Plugerville where it
traverses rural land to the southeast. The terminus
of Segment 2 is located at the Union Pacific Rail­
road, just south of US 290. The highway traverses
several named streams, including Brushy Creek,
Wilbarger Creek, Harris Branch, and Gilleland
Creek. There are also several unnamed tributaries
and minor streams within Segment 2. As stated in
the research design, several parcels were eliminated
from the field investigation based on their location
within low or moderate probability areas and not
coordinated with TxDOT-ENV or the THC. Al­
though every Additional Property was submitted to
a pre-survey investigation, only those parcels in
high probability areas were formally coordinated in
an Impact Evaluation. The parcels in low or mod­
erate probability areas were formally coordinated
with TxDOT and the THC on September 4, 2003
(Appendix B). A total of 35 parcels were investi­
gated in Segment 2 between July 16, 2003 and
June 22, 2005. All of these parcels were subjected
to a pre-survey and the results submitted in an
impact evaluation. Of the 35 parcels, 26 were de­
termined to have a low probability for archeologi­
cal sites to occur and were recommended for no
additional archeological investigations. The re­
maining nine parcels were recommended for in­
tensive survey. Four of the nine parcels (Parcels
114, 115, 116, and 117) were coordinated under a
separate permit, TAC #3275. The parcels are listed
in Table 3 and indicate at which phase of investi­
gation (pre-survey, survey, or testing) these par­
cels were cleared. Clearance is indicated by the
date of coordination with the THC.
The 26 parcels in Segment 2 that were deter­
mined to have a low probability for archeological
sites to occur, were typically located in upland ar­
eas or areas of previous disturbance. There were no
archeological sites previously recorded on these
properties. In general, these areas exhibited shal­
low, deflated soils, exposed bedrock, and distur­
bance from previous development and agricultural
use. Agricultural disturbance in the project area
was often limited to plowing and grazing, which
contribute to increased erosion. However, the in­
vestigators often encountered terraced fields used
to control erosion. This terracing within the shal­
low upland soils would result in the loss of any
intact archeological deposits.

Survey investigations in Segment 2 occurred in
areas adjacent to streams, previously recorded ar­
cheological sites, and areas determined to have a high
probability for sites to occur based on the pre-survey
investigations. The results of the survey are presented
from north to south starting with Section 5 and end­
ing with Section 10. All of Section 7 is located within
low and moderate probability areas as defined by
PBS&J and was not surveyed or coordinated.
An intensive survey of the Additional Properties
on Parcel 118 resulted in the identification of no
archeological deposits. Six shovel tests placed
within the current project area were all negative for
archeological deposits. The shovel test data revealed
that shallow, agriculturally disturbed upland soils
encompass much of the project area. In these upland
areas shovel tests were terminated 37-100 centi­
meters below ground surface due to dense gravels
or caliche. In lowland or drainage areas where
fluviatile terrace deposits have formed, shovel tests
extended to 75-100 centimeters below ground

surface. Shovel tests in these alluvial deposits were
terminated due to compact clay or bedrock.
A minor tributary of Brushy Creek and the
construction of a water pipeline have disturbed
approximately 50% of the lowland soils found
within the Parcel 118 Additional Property. The main
watercourse of this minor tributary extends to
bedrock and has hastened the erosion of soils
deposited along the main water channel. The
construction of a water pipeline in the Additional
Property area has disturbed soils to an approximate
depth of two feet unless bedrock exposures have
precluded the line from burial. The disturbances
found in this small Additional Property area (approx.
0.25 acres) decrease the likelihood of encountering
any in situ archeological deposits. These shallow
soil deposits further decrease the likelihood of
recovering a stratified cultural deposit within a
fluviatile terrace deposit. Moreover, in a similar
topographic context at nearby Site 41WM1026,
PBS&J trenching data reports that alluvial deposits

Results of Field Investigations 49

on the south side of Brushy Creek are shallow (<220
centimeters below ground surface) and disturbed
(Rogers and Hales 2002).
As stated previously, Parcels 114, 115, 116, and
117 were coordinated under TAC Permit #3275.
However a summary of those investigations is pre­
sented here. These four parcels were located adja­
cent to Site 41WM1010, a NRHP-eligible site that
was mitigated within the EDA right-of-way by
PBS&J. Due to the presence of NRHP-eligible Site
41WM1010 adjacent to the current project, special
considerations were given to identify archeological
deposits that may be associated with the site in the
current project area. As a result of the survey and an
accelerated schedule the results of both the survey
and testing investigations were coordinated in one
report under TAC Permit #3275 (Karbula et al.
2004). The Phase I survey consisted of a series of
shovel tests and backhoe trenches excavated over
the entirety of the project area (Figure 9). Prehis­
toric and historic archeological deposits were en­
countered in the southern and central portions of the
project area (in Parcel 114) and most likely repre­
sent a western extension of Site 41WM1010. No
archeological deposits were identified in Parcels
116 or 117 in the current project area. The identifi­
cation of archeological artifacts along the west edge
of the project indicates that this site may extend
further to the west. A total of six trenches and 57
shovel tests were excavated, exposing a total of 15
features and recovering 335 prehistoric artifacts
within two discrete occupational zones at 65-95
centimeters and 2.65-2.9 meters below ground sur­
face (Figure 10). All observed features were isolated
to Trench 3 and 6 and were moderately dense in
distribution. No historic features were observed on
the site and historic artifacts identified on the site
were limited to the plow zone. It was recommended
that the historic component of this site does not con­
tain significant enough deposits to warrant inclusion
in the NRHP. However, the prehistoric artifacts iden­
tified during survey within the project represent a
western extension of 41WM1010. This area was rec­
ommended for formal testing to determine its NRHP
eligibility as a contributing component to the site.
Upon identification of Site 41WM1010 within
the current project area, Phase II eligibility testing
was conducted to determine whether the archeologi­
cal deposits in the Additional Property contributed
to the NRHP eligibility of the eastern portion of the

site. Phase II investigations were limited to Trench
3 and 6 only and consisted of 18 hand excavated test
units totaling 6.7 m3 excavated volume (Figure 11).
Additional machine excavations were conducted
within Trench 3 and the area surrounding a possible
post mold in Trench 6. During the survey and test­
ing phase a total of 15 features were documented. A
total of 335 chipped stone artifacts were recovered
during both phases of fieldwork. These included
eight stone tools, two bifaces, one drill, and five
retouched flakes. Debitage densities were very low
around all features, similar to much of the previous
PBS&J 41WM1010 results (Dixon et al. 2002; Dixon,
et al. 2003b). No diagnostic artifacts were recovered.
Only one piece of charcoal was recovered from Fea­
ture 2 in Trench 3. A total of 13 small faunal elements
were recovered in shovel tests on Parcel 114, but
none in hearth feature contexts. The results of the
testing confirmed that the western portion of site
41WM1010 is represented by two discrete occupa­
tional zones at 55-95 centimeters and at 2.65-2.9
meters below ground surface. These occupations are
represented by features of burned rock concentra­
tions, concentrations of snail shells and a few pieces
of lithic debris. No culturally or temporally diagnos­
tic artifacts were recovered during the Phase I or
Phase II investigations. Radiocarbon and sediment
dates recovered from features and stratigraphic hu­
mate samples date components in Trenches 3 and 6 to
approximately 2300-2600 years B.P.
The Trench 6 materials are structurally similar
to the rock features documented by PBS&J within
the SH 130 EDA right-of-way (Figure 12). The
Trench 6 features exhibit poor organic preser­
vation, a very low-density lithic assemblage and
no diagnostic artifacts. Site structure, site content,
feature morphology, organic preservation, lithic
composition and density are similar to the PBS&J
investigations. Sediment and charcoal dates from
Parcel 114 extend the site chronology back in time
approximately 400 years, to 800 B.C. The
boundaries of Site 41WM1010 are expanded to
include Parcel 114 and areas to the west to the
edge of an adjacent borrow pit. Trench 6 materials
expand the time frame and site boundaries but are
not contributing elements to the NRHP/SAL
eligibility of the site. This eligibility rests primarily
in the stratified, well preserved and dated
Transitional (Darl) and Post Archaic (Scallorn)
occupations at the site (Dixon, et al. 2003b). One

radiocarbon assay from Trench 3 indicates overlap
with the Trench 6 Late Archaic occupation. Similar
to Trench 6, Trench 3 cultural features are not
well preserved structurally nor do they exhibit
good organic preservation. The lithic materials are
very low density and few stone tools are
represented. No diagnostic artifacts were observed.
Parcel 114 prehistoric materials are reasonably

intact, discretely buried and extend the chronology
of the site back into Late Archaic I Castroville or
Castroville/Marcos time intervals. These materials
however do not contribute to the NRHP/SAL
eligibility of Site 41WM1010. For all of these
reasons, no further investigations were recom­
mended for Site 41WM1010 within the Additional
Properties.

Results of Field Investigations 53

An archeological survey was conducted on the
Additional Properties overlapping the western por­
tions of Parcels 191 and 192. A total of seven shovel
tests were excavated within the Additional Proper­
ties, two of which were positive for historic cul­
tural materials. An historic well and an historic
cistern (Cistern 1) were documented within the Ad­
ditional Properties surveyed. A second cistern (Cis­
tern 2) was documented outside the Additional Prop­
erties in the EDA Schematic right-of-way. Hicks &
Company documented the debris scatter and the
three features as one site, 41TV2103 that spans
Parcels 191 and 192. At the time this site was not
considered to be related to Site 41TV1417, an his­
toric homestead site located in close proximity to
Site 41TV2103 on Parcels 191-192.
At the request of TxDOT-ENV, Hicks & Com­
pany revisited Sites 41TV2103 and 41TV1417 to
evaluate deposits within the EDA schematic, and to
assess their relationship to one another. Investiga­
tors had access to the entirety of Parcels 191-194
and revisited the originally mapped location of Site
41TV1417. Investigators placed 31 shovel tests at
Site 41TV2103 and 12 shovel tests around Site
41TV1417. Additionally, a detailed topographic
map was created of both sites using a Total Data
Station (TDS). The survey and shovel tests of the
two sites located within the original EDA sche­
matic and Additional Properties suggests that the
two sites exhibit vastly different artifact patterning.
Site 41TV2103 contains a dense scatter of artifacts
on the surface and buried up to 20 centimeters
below ground surface; Site 41TV1417, situated on
Parcels 192-194, exhibits a sparse debris scatter
confined exclusively to the surface. A number of
domestic features were documented on Site
41TV2103 while just one pier feature was docu­
mented on 41TV1417 on the Parcels examined. It
is argued that Sites 41TV1417 and 41TV2103 rep­
resent different households, though the two were
probably related as part of a larger tenant farming
community in the area.
Site 41TV2103 is a historic homestead site. It
is located on a hilltop and spans a seasonal drainage,
extending part of the way up a hill slope on the
other side (Figure 13). Features initially docu­
mented include a brick well and two brick cisterns.
The two cisterns are located on the top of the hill on
the north side of the drainage, while the well is
located on the other side of the drainage, halfway

up the hill on the south side (Figure 14). A
substantial artifact scatter was noted around the
cisterns and on a dirt road running along the north
bank of the drainage bisecting the site. The artifact
scatter decreases significantly on the other side of
the drainage, to the south.
The well bears an inscription that reads “J.T.
1901” in it. Cistern 1 bears an inscription that reads
“April 5, 1910” (Figures 15 and 16). Both the well
and Cistern 1 are made of yellow to buff paste flatfaced bricks, commonly used in the Austin area
after the 1870s. Cistern 1 is a bell-shaped cistern
covered with sandy paste cement. Investigators were
not able to determine its exact dimensions, but it
looked to be roughly standard-sized for its time.
The width is approximately 9-12 feet, while its
depth is perhaps 15-20 feet (Austin and San Anto­
nio cistern dimensions are recorded in Thomas and
Adovasio 1996; Wright 1997; Feit et al. 2003; and
Anthony 1996). Cistern 2 bears no inscription, but
the bricks, the cement covering it, and its large size
suggests it is of later date—likely the 1920s or
1930s. It is roughly pear-shaped and its dimensions
looked to be approximately 15-20 feet wide by 25
feet deep (Figure 17). Neither cistern was filled,
and very little debris was noted at their base.
Investigators noted two in-place cedar foun­
dation posts, and an intact limestone porch walk­
way located directly east of Cistern 1. One other
cedar foundation post was found out of place in
the general vicinity. All of these features were
obscured by dense broom weed and large branches
that had been recently cut down and piled within
the right-of-way for the staking of the Additional
Property cut line. A possible gravel drive was
noted on Parcel 192, adjacent to the area where
the structural remains were noted. Investigators
noted a large amount of large gravels on the sur­
face and in Shovel Test A2, covering a width of
roughly 15 feet and extending from the structure
to the dirt road on the south. The area was covered
with very dense thorny vegetation, trees, and large
shrubs, however, making assessment very diffi­
cult without first clearing the vegetation.
One feature was noted near Cistern 2. This was
a concrete block with a cast-iron pipe sunk into it,
located approximately 10 meters north of the cis­
tern. It was in alignment with a terracotta intake
pipe located at the base of the cistern. No founda­
tion or other features were noted around Cistern 2,

or around the well on Parcel 192.
Investigators placed shovel tests along four
transects at Site 41TV2103, in the vicinity of Cis­
terns 1 and 2. The shovel test transects were spaced
roughly 15 meters apart and each test was excavated
every 15 meters. The tests extended beyond the ex­
tent of the debris scatter on the north and east sides,
and were bounded by the Additional Properties limit
and the drainage on the west and south sides, respec­
tively. Two additional tests were placed near the
observed structure foundations associated with Cis­
tern 1. Finally, seven tests were placed in a linear
pattern along the length of the Additional Properties
on Parcels 191 and 192. Sixteen of the 31 shovel
tests were positive for historic cultural materials.
Positive tests contained scattered debris in the upper
20 centimeters of sediment. These tests revealed, not
surprisingly, that artifact density is highest between
Cisterns 1 and 2, and on the down slope leading
toward the drainage (Figure 18).
A number of cut nails found within shovel tests
and on the surface indicate that the building structures
may have been completed during the late nineteenth
century, or possibly earlier (Figure 19). Other
roughly dateable artifacts include solarized,

manganese bleached glass bottles with hand applied
lips, a brown Bennington ceramic marble, a brown
square snuff bottle fragment, a whiteware fragment
with a maker’s mark attributable to Clementson
Brothers in Hanley, England (1865-1916), a brown
glass bottle with a (early twentieth century) threaded
closure, a porcelain doll plate with a “made in Japan”
stamp (1921-1945), and wire nails (Figure 20).
Taken as a whole, the artifact content from shovel
tests and surface collection suggest a late nineteenth
to early twentieth century occupation, with the lower
and upper dates roughly falling between 1880 and
1940. It is likely however, that the actual period of
occupation was narrower, falling roughly between
1900 and 1930. No shovel tests were placed around
the well, as it was evident that this area is highly
eroded due to the dirt two-track road and due to
extensive slope wash into the drainage.
Investigators then placed 12 tests in and around
the previously mapped location of Site 41TV1417
on Parcels 192, 193, and 194. None of these tests
contained any cultural material. The originally
mapped (1988) location of Site 41TV1417 shows
the site located on Parcel 194, across the fence
from Parcel 193 and on the east side of a seasonal

drainage (within the SH 130 right-of-way). During
their 2001 survey PBS&J expanded those boun­
daries to cover parts of Parcels 192 and 193 within
the EDA schematic right-of-way. During the current
survey, no evidence of a site was found at the
originally mapped location for Site 41TV1417.
However, a diffuse scatter of surface historic debris
was noted west of the mapped site location on Parcel
192 (within the Additional Properties), and
extending onto Parcel 194. The portion of the site

lying on Parcel 194 was outside the SH 130
Additional Properties right-of-way. The historic
debris concentration was heavier on Parcel 194
(outside the right-of-way) and was localized within
a small mesquite and juniper thicket. This scatter is
located on the same side of the drainage as the
historic well associated with Site 41TV2103, and
the well is probably also associated with Site
41TV1417. A number of historic era bricks (of the
same type as the well) and large rough-cut limestone

blocks were noted among the domestic debris on
Parcel 194. The bricks were buff to yellow paste
Austin Common bricks typical of the late nineteenth
century. None of them appeared to be in situ, but
there was sufficient density of them to suggest that
they represent a highly disturbed structural remain.
Investigators also noted one short cedar post,
probably a foundation pier, among the brick and
domestic debris. Artifacts found on the surface
included a blue glazed stoneware Dutch oven lid,
manganese bleached glass, solarized clear bottle
glass, milk glass, plain porcelain, various flat irons,
and a brass pendulum clock part inscribed “E.
Ingraham” with a patent date of October 10 1878
and November 11 1879 (E. Ingraham was a clock
maker in Bristol Connecticut; Figures 21, 22, and
23). The company produced pendulum clocks from
1857 to 1958) (Jimerson and Salerno 2005). The
debris scatter most likely represents the remains of
Site 41TV1417 (which may have been mis-mapped
originally) and shows signs of disturbance from
heavy livestock traffic. No tests were excavated
within the brick and debris concentration on Parcel
194 because it lies outside the SH 130 right-of-way.

However, 12 shovel tests were excavated outside
the scatter, but within the original EDA schematic
right-of-way and the Additional Properties on
Parcels 192, 193 and 194. No surface debris was
noted around them and none of the tests contained
cultural material.
Research revealed that the entire survey area
was on the western edge of the property owned by
August and Adele Palm in 1898 (Travis County Road
Plat Book 1898-1902; Figure 24). The Palms are
listed as living on the property in the 1900 census.
They also appear in the 1901 Travis County Rural
Directory as living in the Manor area. August Palm
came to Texas from Sweden with his parents and
several uncles (Swante Palm was one) in 1845. The
Palm family settled first in the Richmond area, and
then moved westward in search of a more healthful
climate. His mother purchased land in Williamson
County, in the area now known as Palm Valley (Palm,
AHC Biographical Files). Other family members
settled in Austin. In 1861 August married Adele
Atwood, whose family lived on a farm just west of
Manor (Brown 1900). The couple lived in Austin
where August Palm operated a general merchandise

store. He also owned numerous properties throughout
Travis and Williamson Counties. His store is listed
in the 1872 Austin Directory as being on Congress
Avenue between Bois D’arc and Hickory (Polk
1872). He lived with his wife at 202 9th Street in a
house designed by the French architect Michel
DeChaumes, who designed the first capitol building
(Palm, AHC Biographical Files).
Palm, in partnership with his uncle S. Swenson
was instrumental in bringing Swedish immigrants
to Texas during the 1860s. In 1867 he helped bring
100 Swedish immigrants to the Austin area (Palm,
AHC Biographical Files). Most of them settled in

northeastern Travis County near Manor, and in Palm
Valley in southern Williamson County. He was
also active in Reconstruction Era politics and social
causes (Johnson 1914). During the early 1870s he
is said to have raised $50,000 for the State Institute
for the Blind and the Insane Asylum. According to
one source, Palm also had a 700-acre farm in
Williamson County (which he did not live on) and
was the first person to plant cotton in that area
(Shaver and Rogers 1928). He was considered a
wealthy man, but apparently lost much of his for­
tune during one of the economic depressions of the
1870s (Palm, AHC Biographical Files).

Archeological Investigations of Segment A of Proposed State Highway 130

By most accounts August Palm and his wife
lived primarily in Austin. They are listed at their
house on 9th Street in the 1872 and 1895 Austin
City Directories, and also lived there in 1910 ac­
cording to the US Census for that year. Various
historical accounts link him with the City of Austin
(Johnson 1914; Shaver and Rogers 1926). How­
ever, the 1900 census lists August Palm as a farmer
in the Manor area with his wife Della. It may be
that the Palms returned to farming after losing much
of their fortune during the latter part of the nine­
teenth century. A 1906 letter written by Della to her
daughter Mary implies that she and her husband
August were living on a farm at that time. The
letter is written from “Atwood Place” and in it she
discusses the cotton planting, boll weevils, and a
new pig that the couple was raising. Based on cen­
sus records of the Atwood family (Adele Palm’s
parents), historical accounts (Brown 1900) and vari­
ous deed records, Atwood Place refers to the farm
owned by Adele Palm’s parents and encompassed
the current study area. William and Mary Atwood
deeded parts of their farm to their daughter Adele
in 1867 and 1877 (TCDS Vol R/37, Vol 38/274),
while an adjoining portion (north of Boyce Lane)
went their other daughter Olivia Bittle.
In her 1906 letter to her daughter, Adele Palm
discusses the local farm laborers who lived near
them and their plans for a 4th of July barbecue. The
1900 census shows the Palms as owners of their
farm. After their names, comes a long list of black
and white tenants. Two names who appear on the
same page as renters, James Townsend and James
Tierce, could potentially be the names associated
with the initials “J.T.” inscribed in the well on Site
41TV2103. In addition to the tenant farmers who
were the Palms’ neighbors, a number of Swedish
families are also listed nearby—the Andersons, the
Scogs and the Carlsons all owned farms near the
Palm farm (1900 Census; 1910 Census; Map of
Travis County 1898).
The Groom family owned the farm directly to
the west. No information was found about the
Groom family, other than they are listed in the
1900 and 1910 censuses and in Travis County Ru­
ral Directories. According to the site form for Site
41TV1415, recorded during the same survey that
recorded Site 41TV1417, J.W. Groom purchased
the farm adjoining Atwood Place in 1885 (Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas Online 2004).

Sites 41TV2103 and 41TV1417 within the
current project area are likely the remains of two
different households associated with Atwood Place
(or possibly the Groom farm) around the turn of the
century. The well, situated basically equidistant from
the two domestic sites, suggests that the households
shared water. The sites were most likely the homes
of tenant farmers. Site 41TV2103 appears on a 1940
aerial photo as two small structures located roughly
where Cisterns 1 and 2 are situated; Site 41TV1417
is not visible on that same photo. However, a number
of other small farmhouses are discernable in the
area, in addition to several more substantial home
sites. One of these was located right off the main
road to Manor (later US 290), outside the SH 130
right-of-way, and this may have been the main house
associated with Atwood Place. The Palms also owned
land on the north side of Boyce Lane and their house
may have been located on that tract.
Site records for 41TV1417, recorded during a
1988 survey of the properties adjacent to the SH
130 project area document an interview with Jody
Thurmond, who lived in the area for his entire
life. In that interview he reported that the site of
41TV1417 was part of a tenant farm and that two
additional tenant houses used to be located “up
the drainage” from that site (he mentions the
Grooms as former property owners for part of the
tract that was surveyed in 1988. Their house was
located south and west of the current study area,
again outside the SH 130 right-of-way). By the
late 1940s however, these houses were no longer
standing according to an interview with Marjorie
Nagle, who owned the property on which Site
41TV1417 was recorded.
The initials “J.T.” inscribed into the brick well
at Site 41TV2103 may refer to a Thurmond (the
Thurmond family does appear in Census records
for that area in 1910 but not for 1900) or to one of
the names with initials J.T. that appear in the 1900
census. The initials do not match any of the names
associated with the Palm or Atwood family. Arti­
facts and features all suggest a late nineteenth to
early twentieth century occupation. Most artifacts
appear to date to between 1900 and 1930, with
some earlier debris. The home sites were probably
abandoned by the 1940s.
Both sites represent historic tenant farming oc­
cupations from the late nineteenth through early
twentieth century. They were probably part of the

same community of tenant farmers associated with
Atwood Place or the Groom farm. The two sites
likely do not represent the same households, since
the actual domestic features are separated by 500
feet and a drainage. Each site has its own set of
domestic features associated with it. Evidence of
Site 41TV1417 is very sparse within the SH 130
Additional Properties; the densest part of the site is
located outside the SH 130 right-of-way. Site
41TV2103, by contrast, contains a number of do­
mestic features, including two intact cisterns, an
intact well, some structural foundation remains, and
an ample artifact scatter. Artifacts associated with
41TV2103 are confined mainly to the surface and
scattered within the upper 20 centimeters of sedi­
ment. No discrete artifact-bearing surfaces or fea­
tures were found in any of the 31 tests at Site
41TV2103 or through inspection of features. No
prehistoric cultural material was recorded.
It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator
that the portion of Site 41TV1417 overlapping the
SH 130 right-of-way is not eligible for the National
Register of Historic Places. The site contains very
sparse surface debris and no features within the
Additional Properties. The Principal Investigator
believes that Site 41TV2103 is also not eligible for
the National Register of Historic Places since it
cannot be directly associated with personages of
local significance, it post-dates the 1870s, artifact
content is fairly typical, and finally, no discrete

artifact bearing features are present. The two cisterns
and the well, while intact, are of a common con­
struction type and have no extraordinary research
value. The existing foundation remains consist of a
two wooden posts and a limestone entry walkway. It
is argued that further archeological investigations
would have little research value, though there may
be some additional merit in further archival research
on Atwood Place and the Palm/Atwood family. The
Principal Investigator does not consider Site
41TV2103 worthy of preservation in place, and
recommended it as ineligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places or as an SAL.
TxDOT and the THC concurred with this recom­
mendation on December 17, 2004.
Subsequent to the initial survey of Segment
A, additional right-of-way was added to the Ulti­
mate schematic. These areas all consisted of mi­
nor additions to the right-of-way and did not over­
lap with any previously recorded sites. Investiga­
tors from Hicks & Company conducted a presurvey visit to all of the properties and applied the
same criteria for evaluating the Additional Prop­
erties. An impact evaluation was submitted to
TxDOT and the THC recommending that the ar­
eas have a low probability to contain intact ar­
cheological deposits. No survey was recommended
for these parcels. TxDOT and the THC concurred
with these recommendations on August 4, 2005
(Appendix B).

CHAPTER 6
Conclusions

north between Berry Creek and the San Gabriel,
upland terraces are capped with Pleistocene allu­
vium containing chert and limestone cobbles. These
areas provided a great deal of lithic resources.
Campsites and lithic procurement areas, such as
41WM1013, 41WM1016, and 41WM1021, would
be common in these areas. However, these sites,
located on upland ridges, generally have shallow
deposits and are poorly preserved.
Between the San Gabriel River and Brushy
Creek and even south between Brushy Creek and
the terminus of Segment A the topography consists
of gently rolling uplands. Sites in these areas are
more diffuse, occurring primarily around minor
tributaries and streams. Most of the streams in these
areas are ephemeral drainages and have little po­
tential for burying and preserving archeological de­
posits. The upland ridges have shallow soils and
have been severely disturbed by agricultural activi­
ties. These agricultural activities, such as plowing
and over grazing, have hastened erosion over a
large portion of the project area. Several agricul­
tural fields have been terraced to retard the loss of
topsoil for crop production further disturbing al­
ready shallowly buried deposits.
Sites 41TV1417 and 41TV2103 represent the
only substantive historic age sites in the Additional
Properties. Both of these sites represent early ten­
ant farming in central Texas. Although historic ele­
ments were found at Sites 41WM1013 and
41WM1010, they occurred in a very low density
across both of the sites. Late 19th and early 20th
century farms are likely to be the most common
Historic sites encountered in the region. Much of
the landscape of the current project area is still
dominated by corn, sorghum, and livestock agricul­
ture. There is a potential for historic sites to occur
anywhere in the region.

The objective of this investigation was to identify,
record, and evaluate the cultural resources within the
Additional Properties of Segment A of the proposed
SH 130 right-of-way. This was accomplished through
three levels of investigation: background research,
pre-survey impact evaluations, and intensive survey.
The investigation resulted in the identification of six
archeological sites, 41WM1010, 41WM1012,
41WM1013, 41WM1091, 41TV1417, and 41TV2103,
within the Additional Properties in Segment A. The
portions of these sites within the Additional Properties
have been determined to be ineligible for inclusion in
the NRHP. All of the investigated parcels were
coordinated with TxDOT and the THC and cleared
for construction prior to this report.
The nature of highway projects provides inves­
tigators with a look at a cross section of the arche­
ology within a region. Although archeological sites
were identified within the Additional Properties,
the size of the Additional Properties afforded only
small areas of investigation. The result of this was
the identification of only six sites within the Addi­
tional Properties in Segment A. However, coupled
with the intensive survey by PBS&J this data is
useful for applying a model of prehistoric and his­
toric settlement patterns to central Texas within the
Blackland Prairie.
Overall the sites within the Additional Proper­
ties, except 41WM1010, exhibit poor preservation
and a low density of artifacts. This is primarily due
to the small size of the Additional Properties, but
also in part to the geomorphology of the region. As
expected, major streams, like the San Gabriel River
and Brushy Creek have the highest potential for
archeological sites. Both of these streams have
stable floodplains with a potential for deeply buried
intact archeological deposits. Evidence of this is
seen at Sites 41WM1010 and 41WM1012. To the
