MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 4 November 2010, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed 7.5-acre Texarkana Convention Center
development tract in Bowie County, Texas (Project Area). Because the City of Texarkana is
considered a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Additionally, the development of the Project Area may utilize
a Nationwide Permit (NWP) issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As such, the
undertaking also falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. On behalf of the City of Texarkana, Castilaw Environmental
Services, LLC (Castilaw) contracted with Horizon to conduct the intensive cultural resources
survey of the Project Area. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee
(TAC) permit number 5799 in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any cultural resources were located within the Project Area and, if so, to determine
their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for formal
designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
The survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. Except for modern
trash produced as a result of dumping, no cultural materials were observed on the surface of
Project Area or within any of the 15 excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the Project Area, it is
Horizon’s opinion that development of the Texarkana Convention Center tract will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted. Horizon
therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.

Bowie County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the
proposed 7.5-acre Texarkana Convention Center development tract located in Bowie County,
Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 and 2). Additionally, the development of the Project Area may
utilize a Nationwide Permit (NWP) issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As
such, the undertaking also falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. On behalf of the City of Texarkana, Castilaw
Environmental Services, LLC (Castilaw) contracted with Horizon to conduct the intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area. The survey was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number 5799 in compliance with the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were
located within the Project Area and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for formal designation as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs).
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Reymundo Chapa served as Principal Investigator for the project, while Jennifer Cochran
conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 4 November 2010. This consisted
of an intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing within the Project Area. The
Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2
shovel tests per 1.0 acres on projects between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size. As such, the 7.5
acres comprising the Project Area required a total of 15 shovel tests in order to comply with the
TSMASS. Horizon complied with the TSMASS by conducting 15 shovel tests within the Project
Area.
The survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. Except for modern
trash produced as a result of dumping, no cultural materials were observed on the surface or
within any of the 15 excavated shovel tests.

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area consists of a 7.5-acre tract of land located within the City of Texarkana,
Texas, in the southeast quadrant of the intersection of Cowhorn Creek Road and Cowhorn
Creek Loop. Its location can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5’ Texarkana,
Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). Currently, the property is cleared of substantial
vegetation and has been leveled by heavy machinery. The Project Area is the proposed
location of the Texarkana Convention Center. The northern half of the Project Area will contain
a hotel, and the southern half will contain the convention center and its adjacent parking lot.
Properties in the immediate vicinity recently have been developed and include a golf driving
range abutting the Project Area to the east (owned by Texarkana Independent School District)
and Texas Bank and Trust abutting the Project Area to the northwest (4646 Cowhorn Creek
Road). Photographs of the general property are provided in Figures 3 through 6.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in eastern Bowie County, Texas. The property is located in
the lowland convergence of an unnamed stream system and Cowhorn Creek. Elevations in the
Project Area range between approximately 335.0 feet above mean sea level (amsl) in the
northern half and 310.0 feet amsl in the southern half. The southern half of the Project Area
contains 1 unnamed ephemeral stream that measures roughly 5.0 by 220.0 feet (1.5 by 67.0
meters [m]) and 1 intermittent stream that measures roughly 8.0 by 650.0 feet (2.4 by 198.1 m).
These streams converge in the southern half of the Project Area and flow southeast to Cowhorn
Creek, which is located just outside the Project Area’s east boundary. In turn, Cowhorn Creek
flows into a series of waterways that eventually empty into the Red River, approximately 25.0
miles southeast of the Project Area.

FLORA AND FAUNA

The proposed right-of-way (ROW) is situated in the central portion of the Austroriparian
biotic province (Blair 1950), which is bordered on the west by the Texan province and extends

Bowie County, Texas

east to the Atlantic Coast. Species range from forest dwellers to grassland inhabitants and
species that are transitional between the 2 provinces. Many species are local inhabitants
throughout much of Northeast Texas and Northwest Louisiana. The Austroriparian biotic
province is dominated by pine-oak forest, 47 species of mammals, 29 species of snakes, 10
species of lizards, 2 species of land turtles, 17 species of anurans, and 18 species of urodeles
(Blair 1950). Vegetation within the Project Area has been heavily altered due to clearing and
consists primarily of short grass.

2.5

CLIMATE

The modern climate of the region is characterized as humid subtropical, with warm,
humid weather from the spring to the fall, and cool, humid weather in the fall and winter. The
climate is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is
modified by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring,
summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental
climate characterized by considerable variations in temperature. Summers are long and warm.
Winters are short and mild and are characterized by short periods of clear, cold, or freezing
weather interspersed with cloudy and rainy periods and clear, pleasant days. Extremely hot or
cold temperatures are rare. Sudden temperature changes are not very common during
summer, but may occur frequently in winter. Rapid drops in winter temperature are caused by
cold waves or sudden, strong north winds, though freezing weather is uncommon. Average
winter temperatures range between 2 and 10 degrees Celsius (°C) (35 and 50 degrees
Fahrenheit [°F]), and average summer temperatures range from 29 to 35°C (85 to 95°F).
Valleys and low divides are often covered with frost on winter early mornings, but freezing
temperatures are of short duration. The average frost-free season is 246 days (March 15 to
November 16) (Bomar 1983).
The region is well watered—precipitation falls rather uniformly over the area and is fairly
well distributed throughout the year. Normally, it is heaviest in December, March, April, and
May, and lowest in August. Rainfall varies from year to year, but the average is about 114
centimeters (cm) (45 inches [in]). Torrential rains fall occasionally, especially in winter and
spring, and light snows fall occasionally in winter but melt rapidly. Hailstorms are infrequent but
do occur in the vicinity of the project area. Precipitation generally increases from north to south
across the region and decreases from east to west in a clinal pattern. Droughts are not
uncommon, and periods of lower summer precipitation are often accompanied by extended
droughts caused by warm continental Pacific air masses moving across the area from the west.

3.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Horizon conducted archival research using the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
web site (THC 2010) in order to determine if previously recorded archeological sites, historic
structures, or cemeteries exist within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the Project
Area. This review indicated that no formal cultural resources surveys have been conducted
within the boundaries of the Project Area and that no previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries, including any listed on the NRHP or formally designated as SALs, are located within
a 1.0-mile (1.2-km) perimeter of the Project Area. Additionally, a review of Texarkana
Quadrangle maps dating from 1906 onward show no evidence of structures of any kind within
the Project Area (PCL 2010).

4.0 METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the Project Area on
4 November 2010. This entailed an intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing
efforts. The TSMASS require a minimum of 2 shovel test per 1.0 acres on projects between 3.0
and 10.0 acres in size. As such, a total of 15 shovel tests were needed within the 7.5-acre
Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon complied with the TSMASS by
conducting 15 shovel tests within the Project Area.
The central portion of the Project Area held standing water, which was due in part to
recent rains in the area. These areas were not tested, but the ground surrounding the areas
was surveyed.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs, along with their accompanying photo log, were also
completed. Locations representing shovel tests have been overlaid onto topographic maps of
the Project Area with the help of handheld GPS units, which were used in the field. These GPS
handheld units utilize the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. These shovel
test locations are presented in Figure 8, and shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

5.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1

RESULTS

The survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. Except for modern
trash produced as a result of dumping, no cultural materials were observed on the surface of the
Project Area or within any of the 15 excavated shovel tests.

5.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the Project Area, it is
Horizon’s opinion that development of the Texarkana Convention Center tract will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted at these
locations. Therefore, Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the
undertaking.
