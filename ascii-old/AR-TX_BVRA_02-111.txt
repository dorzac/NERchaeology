ABSTRACT
The construction corridor associated with a 17,000 foot water line in central
Brazos County, Texas was examined for the presence of significant archaeological sites
by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in December 2002 and February 2003.
The field survey was supervised by William E. Moore who was the Principal
Investigator. The majority of the proposed water line (15,100 feet) will be placed along
city and county roads in an area already disturbed by various utilities and road
construction. This segment is a low probability area for the presence of significant
archaeological sites since the soils overlying clay are shallow and the water line route
does not cross or pass near any major streams. The remaining 1900 feet of the
proposed water line, however, traverses cross-country on private property in a setting
not disturbed by city utilities or road construction. This segment is closer to Turkey
Creek, a first order stream that flows into the Brazos River. In this area shovel testing
and probing was conducted. No archaeological sites were found and it is, therefore,
recommended that the City of Bryan be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division; the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL); the City of
Bryan; and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by the City of Bryan to conduct a 100% Phase I cultural
resources survey of the proposed 24 inch water main alignment in central Brazos
County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on United States Geological
Survey topographical maps Bryan West and Chances Store (Figure 2). The proposed
water line is 17,000 feet in length with a permanent easement of 20 feet. A 24 inch pipe
will be placed in a 48 inch wide trench with an average depth of 5-6 feet. The proposed
water line begins at the pump station in downtown Bryan and runs south along Main
Street to Finfeather Road. It then travels south along Leonard Road, turns east onto
Chick Lane, runs to the south overland for approximately 1900 feet, and terminates at
an existing water line. For the purpose of this report, the project area begins at the
Finfeather Road and Leonard Road intersection. When converted to acres, the 17,000
foot project area is 7.8 acres in size. There are two sections of Leonard Road in Bryan.
The original section of Leonard Road, the subject of this report, was constructed by the
Texas Highway Department in 1953 under the name Farm-to-Market Road 1688 (Texas
Highway Department 1950).
In a letter from Mark H. Denton at the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division, to William R. Cullen, P.E. of CSC Engineering & Environmental Consultants,
Inc. dated January 31, 2001, Mr. Denton states that an archaeological survey is
required prior to site development. In order to satisfy this requirement, the City of
Bryan, through CSC Engineering & Environmental Consultants, Inc., retained Brazos
Valley Research Associates to perform this service. This project will be reviewed at the
state level by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). This
physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acid sandy loams or
sands.
The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for the county is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees and a July maximum temperature of 95 degrees
combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:180). The
altitude varies from 200-400 feet.
No current soils book is available for Brazos County. Therefore, the Principal
Investigator checked the last published soil survey (Mowery et al. 1958) for soil types in
the project area. The 15,100 foot area along city and county roads is located in two
major soil types, Tabor fine sandy loam (Ta), 1-3 percent slopes and Lufkin fine sandy
loam (Ld), 1-3 percent slopes. These are shallow soils with the underlying clay between
8 and 14 inches. In the area shovel tested, the soil type is predominantly Ta soils
(Figure 3). Tabor fine sandy loam is located on stream terraces and is very gently
sloping. It is a deep, moderately well drained soil with depth to the water table at more
than six feet. This soil, however, is saturated at a depth of 0.5 foot to 1.5 feet for short
periods after heavy rains. It does not flood. Runoff is slow, and permeability is very
slow. The surface layer (0 to 6 inches) is a pale brown, strongly acid fine sandy loam.
The subsurface layer (6 to 14 inches) is a pale brown, strongly acid fine sandy loam.
The subsoil, from 14 to 80 inches, consists of various clays.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Brazos County is situated
within the Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to a
statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al.
1985:114), Brazos County contained 33 recorded sites. In 1985, 0 sites in the county
had been excavated, 0 had been tested by hand, and 33 had been surface collected.
Two recorded prehistoric sites in the county were listed as Paleoindian, 1 was listed as
General Archaic, and 1 was listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et al. 1985:114). The
archaeological potential of Brazos County is reflected in part by the increasing number
of recorded sites found as a result of cultural resource management studies. The
number of recorded sites now stands at 151 (Jean Hughes, personal communication,
December 4, 2002).
A check of the records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas revealed no archeological sites have been recorded within the current
project area. It was discovered that sites have been recorded in the region, and several
significant archaeological investigations have been performed in Brazos County.
Prehistoric sites in this area are typically found on sandy ridges and uplands in close
proximity to dependable sources of water such as creeks and rivers. No prehistoric
sites in the county have been reported on clay hills or in active floodplains.
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Brazos County, especially when numerous contract reports are available.
The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985) and the
planning document published by the Texas Historical Commission (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993) for more detailed information regarding the prehistory of Brazos County.

FIELD METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator checked with the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory for the presence of previously recorded sites in the
project area and vicinity. No sites were found to be within the route of the proposed
water line. Prior to visiting the project area with the survey crew, the Principal
Investigator drove that portion of the route along Leonard Road and observed the
presence of a fiber optic cable and telephone lines as well as an excavated drainage
ditch created when the road was constructed in the 1950s. On December 2, 2002, the
survey crew conducted shovel testing in the 1900 foot cross-country segment (Figure 4)
which is the most undisturbed section in the 17,000 foot project area. The ground
surface visibility in this area was very poor; therefore, the entire 1900 foot area was
shovel tested. The crew began at the southern end and worked to the northeast. This
area is heavily wooded with dense undergrowth. At the beginning of this part of the
project area, the route passes closely to a very deeply incised tributary (or gully) of
Turkey Creek. Shovel tests were placed at approximate 30 meter intervals where the
creek was closest and changed to 45 meter intervals as the route grew more distant
from the creek. In all, 10 tests were excavated in the wooded area. Next, the crew
drove to the north end and walked through the relatively open pasture and dug five
shovel tests. Here, the soil was very wet and difficult to screen. Five tests were
excavated in the pasture area.
Shovel tests were dug to clay when possible, and the size of each test was 30 x
50 cm in diameter and varied in depth from 15 to 70 centimeters below the existing
ground surface. Some tests were terminated due to saturated soils. All excavated fill
was screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Data obtained from shovel testing were
recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I). In all, 15 shovel tests were dug.
Following comments by the reviewer for the Texas Historical Commission it
became apparent that the disturbed nature of the 15,100 feet along Leonard Road and
Chick Lane needed to be better explained in the report. The Principal Investigator
compared the new soil data with that in the 1958 soil survey to see if the soil types had
changed based on more recent soil analysis in the field. No significant changes were
noted. Also, the Bryan Area Office of the Texas Department of Transportation was
visited to collect information regarding the construction of Leonard Road and associated
utility lines in the immediate area. The City of Bryan Planning and Zoning Department
was also contacted for information regarding the construction of Chick Lane at the
southern end of the project area. The report was revised to reflect this additional work.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been recorded in the project area. There was also
no indication that any part of the project area had been surveyed by professional
archaeologists. No archaeological sites were found in the project area as a result of this
survey. A review of the soil survey for Brazos County revealed that the soils in this area
are shallow with clay at or near the surface. Along most of the project area construction
corridor clay is present between 8 and 14 inches from the ground surface.
The visit to the Bryan Area Office of the Texas Department of Transportation
office in Bryan produced useful data. According to the final plans for the construction of
Leonard Road, the drainage ditches associated with road construction averaged 1.5
feet in depth, and 9000 cubic yards of dirt was removed (Texas Highway Department
1950). According to Jay O. Page (personal communication to William E. Moore on
February 18, 2003), the Leonard Road Water Transmission Improvements project from
Farm-to-Market Road 2818 to the beginning of Leonard Road was installed in 1989.
This project greatly disturbed the construction corridor related to this survey with the
installation of a 20 inch water line in a ditch with a minimum depth of 6 feet and a
minimum width of 6 feet. In addition, a trailer park and several residences now occupy
the landscape along this route. They are served by local utilities that have also
contributed to the overall disturbance of this section of Leonard Road. It can be stated
that north of Farm-to-Market Road 2818, the area is completely urban with residences
and a trailer park. Some of the current development is not depicted on the outdated
topographic maps that were used for this project. Both the Bryan West and Chances
Store quadrangles were photorevised in 1980 over 20 years ago.
Along Chick Lane, the ditches are regularly scraped and reshaped, a process
that occurs every 3-4 years. At the same time excess dirt is removed from the ditches
and moved to other locations in the city. According to Paul Kasper (personal
communication to William E. Moore on February 20, 2003), Assistant City Engineer, 1-2
feet of dirt was removed in the initial construction of the ditches.
It is the opinion of Brazos Valley Research Associates that there are no
significant archaeological sites within the route of the water line. The 15,100 foot area
that was not shovel tested is viewed as a low probability area for significant
archaeological sites for two reasons. First, the construction corridor generally follows
an upland ridge containing poorly developed soils with clay at or near the surface.
Second, the main channel of Turkey Creek, the nearest major stream, is approximately
1800 meters to the south. Based on discussions with soil scientists at the local Natural
Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), the drainage pattern shown on the
topographic maps near the project area along Leonard Road consists of the upper
reaches of tributaries of Turkey Creek, many of which are gullies created by erosion and
not actual stream channels.

Disturbance to the project area along Leonard Road and Chick Lane has
removed all of the topsoil that would contain cultural materials if archaeological sites
were present. In addition, surface drainage in these areas is controlled by drainage
ditches located adjacent to Leonard Road and Chick Lane. The location of these
drainage ditches coincides with the proposed water main alignment.

10

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is
always possible that archaeological sites are missed during any cultural resources
survey. Should areas containing prehistoric or historic artifacts not discussed in this
report be discovered during construction, the Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission, must be notified immediately and all work stopped in the area of concern
until the situation can be evaluated.
