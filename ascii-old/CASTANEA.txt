Climate, Fire, and Land-Use History in the
Oak-Pine-Hickory Forests of Northeast Texas
During the Past 3500 Years

ABSTRACT Analyses of a palaeo-channel deposit in the valley of Big Sandy Creek in northeast
Texas indicate that well preserved pollen of primary origin is encountered in high concentrations.
Stratigraphic pollen data derived are employed towards a reconstruction of the history of the
regional pine-hardwood forest from 3500 cal. BP until present. This bio-stratigraphic sequence
demonstrates that the valley has remained almost completely under forest canopy during the Middle
and Late Holocene, when it is comprised of a mixture of oak, pine, and hickory. During the past
3500 yrs, the relative importance of these taxa has also varied due to drought and fire. In this
respect, a differential (riparian) representation by moisture-sensitive river birch in the pollen
sequence strongly suggests that periodic droughts in the valley have caused a secular variation in fire
frequency and magnitude. Finally, during the past 800 yrs (Caddo period), the first significant
grasslands and forbs emerge in forest clearings. The latter emergent formations are of possible
anthropogenic origin after pollen data.
INTRODUCTION An ecologic understanding
of the oak-pine-hickory forest of northeastern
Texas is limited by a lack of natural historical
studies of its development in relation to vectors
of environmental change, including palaeoclimatic oscillations and prehistoric land-use
patterns. At present, only two comparative
pollen studies have been conducted in Northeast
Texas and adjacent regions. These include
a terminal Holocene sequence from Buck Creek
Marsh in Wood County, North Texas (Holloway
1985), and a pan-Holocene sequence from the
small Ferndale bog in southeastern Oklahoma
(cf. Bryant and Holloway 1985). In addition, the
vegetation histories derived from these two
pollen sites are limited by chronological concerns and factors of over-representation of the
local flora. The problem of local floral overrepresentation was first noted from small bogs in
wooded situations (Tauber 1967, Rybnickova
and Rybnicek 1971, and Anderson 1974). Such
canopy-shielded areas recruit pollen mostly from
gravity-deposition from local trees and herbs,
rather than pollen carried in regional winds. In
contrast, the pollen stratigraphy from the present study was taken from a palaeo-channel
deposit by Big Sandy Creek in Upshur County,
Texas and was recruited primarily from surface
run-off from a major land area during the last
3,500 yrs.

The modern vegetation in the Big Sandy Creek
valley consists of oak-pine-hickory forest (McMahan et al. 1984). This forest type is dominated by
Pinus taeda and P. echinata in the uplands, and
Quercus rubra, Q. stellata, and various Carya spp.
in the bottomlands, with Betula nigra on the
riparian verge. In bio-geographic terms, bottomland forests in northeastern Texas are more
expansive in regions of higher precipitation,
and more restricted to riparian zones in regions
where drought periods are more common. Along
these lines, Betula nigra in particular is sensitive
to periodic drought (cf. Koevenig 1976). Also fire,
which is often caused by drought, is known to
increase the amount of Pinus and decrease the
amount of Quercus in the pine-hardwood forests
of northeastern Texas (Thorp 1926). Beyond
natural factors, fire clearance by man may also
promote the expansion of Carya, which is a seral
or successional species in parts of the southcentral United States (Thorp 1926). Larger fires or
land-clearance events may furthermore lead to
the expansion of grasslands of the AndropogonStipa association in the region (cf. Schauwecker
and MacDonald 2003).
A general analytic goal of the present study
was to determine whether the vegetation of the
Big Sandy Creek valley remained closed canopy
woodland during the last 3,500 yrs, or whether
there were periods when open grasslands appeared. The study was also conducted to determine if there were shifts in the relative
dominance of Pinus vs. Quercus, or changes in

the amount of Betula, which would indicate
significant periods of drought in this time span.
A specific goal was moreover to assess the
relative importance of natural as opposed to
anthropogenic factors of vegetation change. In
geologic terms, a further goal of the study was to
determine the age of channel incision at the site,
which relates to a period of drought predating
the pollen sequence. Finally, a methodological
goal was to assess the ecologic rationality of
pollen data from slack-water sediments of the
palaeo-channel site.

METHODS
Geologic Field and Dating Methods
A 4.2 meter sediment core, designated as Pollen
Core 13 (Figure 1), was extracted from a palaeochannel adjacent to Big Sandy Creek using
a Geoprobe 54 LT apparatus. The pollen core
stratigraphy was first described after the TroelsSmith (1955) method for characterization of
unconsolidated sediments. A rational dating of
these sediments was then achieved through an
assaying of lignous charcoal by the University of
Georgia, Accelerated Mass Spectrometer (AMS)
Laboratory.1
Core 13 sediments were reduced and organically enriched. Stratigraphically, these exhibited

a lack of evidence for erosional unconformities,
an interpretation further supported by interpolated sedimentation rates (after AMS dating, see
below). These facts, as well as the relatively lowenergy setting of the palaeo-channel on the
slack-water margin of the creek, indicate that
sedimentation has been continuous at the core
locale. Clay and silt sediments also present
indicate that the old channel has acted as a fine
sediment trap which may also incorporate
organics, including charcoal. Indeed, after laboratory work, these deposits were also found to
contain abundant and well-preserved pollen.
Secondary cores from an adjacent sand-bar
deposits and the adjacent terrace were also
retrieved for purposes of determining the potential for secondary pollen deposition into analyzed sediments.
In terms of granulometry, Pollen Core 13
sediments consist mostly of sands, with a minor
admixture of clays and fine silts indicative of
a lower energy depositional environment. Inferences regarding settling velocity after mean
particle size data are conditioned by the fact
that sediment sources of Big Sandy Creek are so
dominated by sand that even small fractions of
fines are indicative of low-energy deposition
(most sand is probably transported by saltation,
cf. Allen 1965). The middle portion of the core
consisted of finer sediments indicative of lower
energy deposition, and represented the main
sequence of fills of a palaeo-channel of Big
Sandy Creek. In contrast, the top (0–45 cm) and
bottom (385–414 cm) portion of the core was
comprised of coarser sands, typical of (later)
higher energy over-bank and (initial) channellag deposits, respectively.
Fine sorting of the length of Core 13 identified
wood charcoal from canopy elements to be
employed in dating. The three AMS dates from
lignous charcoal are presented in Table 2. As
only canopy elements have been dated, secondary rhizomous elements have been avoided. It
should be noted, moreover, that all dates are
sequential with respect to depth.
Additionally, the internal integrity of the AMS
dating sequence bolsters confidence in the
sedimentary integrity of the analyzed pollen
sequence. Secondary carbon derived from reworked deposits would produce either dating
reversals or irregular rates of sedimentation.
After Table 3, such rates of accumulation appear
to be highly rational. Organics thus also appear
to be of an age coeval with that of sedimentation. Along these lines, it is interesting that premodern sedimentation rates vary by only 20%
relative to the core average rate of 11 cm/
century, and moreover, this rate is similar to
accretion rates calculated from other alluvial

sites from different environments (Albert 2004a,
2005a, b). Higher relative rates of modern
sedimentation (0–137 cm, see Table 3) are also
typical, as rates of erosion and accumulation are
enhanced by intensive agriculture and land-use.
Independent of the pollen stratigraphy, AMS
data are of geologic interest in that they indicate
a minimum limiting date for channel downcutting of Big Sandy Creek to before 3500 cal. BP.
Based on the elevation of the Middle Holocene
terrace, the magnitude of down-cutting is greater
than seven meters. It is suggested that a reduction
in mean precipitation is responsible for this event,
which has periodic correlates in the later pollen
zones defined from the old channel fills.
Pollen Laboratory Methods
After filtration, the chemical reduction of pollen
samples was enabled through the addition and
centrifugation of acids and bases. In sequence,
this reduction utilized 20% cold-HCL, 10% hotKOH, 49% hot-HF, a second (10%) warm-HCL
application, and a hot-acetolysis solution (of
10% H2SO4 and 90% acetic anhydride) for one
minute, with a pre- and post-treatment of warmglacial acetic acid. Lycopodium-spikes containing
6000 exotic fern spores were then added for
purposes of calculating pollen concentration
(Faegri et al. 1989). After multiple distilled water
washings, pollen samples were de-hydrated in
100% ETOH, dyed in a saffranine solution with
alcohol, and mounted in a substrate of 2000
viscosity silicone oil for purposes of light microscopic work. Pollen counts of 200–600 grains
were achieved by means of light microscopic
work at 3400 magnification for scanning purposes. More demanding identifications were
made at 31000 magnification in immersion
oil. All pollen data were statistically analyzed

Grimm of the Illinois State Museum, from which

RESULTS
Pollen Concentration and Preservation
Pollen concentration in the primary pollen core
(13) was found to be high, in the order of 20,000–
180,000 grains per cubic cm. These values, as well
as a pristine quality of preservation, are indicative of a high level of primary pollen influx
into site sediments. It can be assumed that both
acidic and reducing characteristics of the sedimentary matrices have inhibited biotic vectors of
pollen degradation (Faegri et al. 1989). Furthermore, a high rate of pollen recruitment is promoted by the mechanics of low energy environments, which encourage the deposition of light
sediments such as pollen grains (cf. Allen 1965).
For comparative purposes, an auxiliary sequence (Core 14) was analyzed to determine
pollen levels in sand bar deposits, where concentration values of only 1% of those from slackwater deposits occur (Table 4). It should also be
noted that samples of oxidized sands from the
adjacent terrace are devoid of pollen. Because
such top-set alluvial and toe-slope colluvial
deposits represent the main erodable sediments
in the valley, significant (0.5+% TLP) secondary
pollen deposition may clearly be discounted in
the main pollen sequence (Albert 2004a). Finally,
because oxidized deposits in the study region do
not preserve pollen for significant periods, pollen
grains recruited into channel deposits must be
contemporary with the age of sedimentation.

statistically significant variations in the response
levels of tree (Pinus, Quercus, Carya, and Betula)
and herb (Stellaria and Asteraceae) pollen taxa.
Significance in the zonation of the diagram is
based on a 95% level at a 2/5 or 1/1 confidence
interval, depending on base-level pollen percentages and absolute pollen counts obtained. This
means that a lower percentage variation may be
considered statistically significant when either
relative base-level percentages or absolute pollen
counts are higher (Faegri et al. 1989). In view of
the mean representation by Pinus, high values in
the pollen diagram are defined as those above
a 45% TLP, while high Quercus values here-in are
defined as those above 25% TLP. Similarly, high
Carya values are defined as those above 5.5%
TLP, and high Betula values as those above 10%
TLP. Intermittent highs (greater than circa 5%
TLP) of Stellaria and Asteraceae are also deemed
to be significant towards pollen zonation, and
covary significantly with secondary woodland
elements such as Myrica. The results of six pollen
assemblage zones are given below and in
Tables 5–6.
PAZ 1 (404–414 cm) 3520-3450 cal. BP, Quercus-Betula: this zone is characterized by high
Quercus (29.9–33.0%) and Betula (20.1–22.2%)
values, with relatively modest Pinus values (22.6–
37.3%). Carya pollen response levels are also low
(2.9–4.5%), while the pollen of Ulmus, Ilex, and
Fagus appears in only trace (1–2%) levels. Also,
trace levels of herbaceous pollen (Gramineae,
Stellaria, Umbelliferae, and Urtica) increase incrementally during this century-long period.
PAZ 2 (374–386 cm) 3300-3210 cal. BP, PinusStellaria: this zone is characterized by a major
rise of Pinus (to 57.6%) and Stellaria (to 14.3%, its
absolute maximum). In tandem with the Stellaria rise, there is an appearance of forbs
(Asteraceae, Senecio-Arctium, Ambrosia Solidago,
and Cirsium) in trace (under 1%) values. Betula
values fall to 3.3% (its absolute minimum),
while those of Quercus decline to 14.8%. This
and bordering zones have been closely sampled,
allowing for a strict chronological definition of
the Pinus-Stellaria high to a circa 40 yr period
after interpolated sedimentation rate data.
PAZ 3 (295–369 cm) 3170-2480 cal. BP, Quercus-Betula: this zone is characterized by a return
to high Quercus (45.9%) and Betula (17.8%)
values. Carya values rise (to 14.2%) in tandem

with an acute high of Pinus (45.2%) near the
beginning of this zone (354 cm), and then
decline to low (below 5%) values, while values
of secondary elements such as Ulmus, Ilex, and
Fagus exhibit much lower response levels (1–5%),
while maintaining a rational representation.
Values of Pinus then fluctuate (22.5–48.0%,
rising terminally), while Stellaria pollen response
levels fall to negligible values. Sampling density
is sufficient in this zone to define a long (700 yr)
period of relative equilibrium.
PAZ 4 (155–275 cm) 2270-960, Pinus: this zone
is characterized by continuously high Pinus
values (49.5–67.6%), with moderate values of
Quercus (10.8–25.0%) and Betula (3.7–14.5%).
The representation by secondary woodland elements (Ulmus, Ilex, and Fagus) becomes sporadic,
although Carya maintains a rational representation. Stellaria values rise intermittently (to
8.2%), while the representation by forbs (esp.
Asteraceae and Ambrosia) is sporadic (1–2%)
during this period. Sampling density is sufficient
to allow for the definition of a very long
(1300 yr) period of relative forest equilibrium in
this pollen zone.
PAZ 5 (88–135 cm) 800-500 cal. BP, CaryaPinus-Stellaria: this zone is characterized by rising
Quercus (8.7–23.2%) and Betula (4.3–12.4%)
values, and an absolute maximum of Carya
(16.9%). Other secondary woodland elements
(Ulmus, Fagus, et al.) occur in only trace values at
this time. In tandem with Carya, Stellaria values
rise (to 8.7%), although the pollen representation by forbs (e.g., Asteraceae) remains very low
(below 1%). Pinus declines steadily during this

12.8%). Asteraceae values rise significantly (to
10.0%), allied with low-amplitude rises in
grasses and other forbs (e.g., Chenopodiaceae
to 1.0%). Sampling density of this zone is
perhaps insufficient to detect all significant
palaeo-vegetational events within this 400 yr
time-span.

DISCUSSION
Pollen Recruitment Mechanics
After studies of pollen influx into stream-fed lake
sediments (Bonny 1976, 1978, Pennington
1979), a majority (80–97%) of pollen is recruited
in such situations by water transport through
surface run-off in a drainage basin. Obviously,
pollen recruitment into sediments accumulating
in the old channel in the study area will also be
achieved principally by means of water transport. The riparian flora proximal to the active
channel may thus be over-represented in the
pollen diagrams, while wooded contexts such as
the site of Pollen Core 13 shield surfaces from the
influx of regional airborne pollen (Tauber 1967,
Anderson 1974, and Jacobson and Bradshaw
1981). High levels (up to 30%) of riparian Betula
(river birch) pollen encountered indeed affirm
that most grains are recruited by water transport, and because the catchment of Big Sandy

Creek is large, in the order of 100 km2, the land
area represented in the pollen diagram is also
regional. In contrast, at sites where local overrepresentation is a major factor, pollen levels
exhibit a random variation due to a patchy
distribution of plants in the limited catchment
area (Rybnickova and Rybnicek 1971). Comparatively then, the pollen data of this study exhibit
continuous trends, and even major changes in
assemblages occur progressively according to
close-interval sampling.
Pollen Zonation and Forest Ecology
Taxonomic variation employed in the pollen
zonation is not only statistically consistent, but
also ecologically rational. For example, an
association of Pinus, representing fire-resistant
P. taeda and P. echinata with Stellaria representing shade-tolerant, late vernal chickweed makes
sense, as pine trees are promoted by high
frequency, small-scale fires which produce patchy clearings allowing moderate light intensities
to reach ground level. In this context, a prevalence of pines over hardwoods under conditions
of higher fire frequency promotes growth of late
vernal herbs because optimal light-intensity
levels for Stellaria growth are more commonly
achieved in the late spring flowering period in
forests where pine is dominant (Bratton 1976).
Also where pine is prominent, a suppression of
mid-level vegetation by the canopy tends to
restrict fires to ground level, where the insulative
characteristics of pine bark imbues these trees
with a greater fire-resistance than hardwoods
(Buckner 1989, Spalt and Reifsnyder 1962). Thus
high Pinus values may be considered as a midseral stage, in that pine prominence depends on
scattered and random disturbance, although
under climate conditions which increase fire
frequency, Pinus may become a climax taxon
(cf. Christensen 1987).
In contrast, extensive clearances in which
succession is circumvented by human activity
will encourage the growth of heliophytic plants
derived from the Andropogon-Stipa association.
This flora includes a large number of forbs which
are associated with anthropogenic impacts (Peacock and Reese 2003, and Schauwecker and
MacDonald 2003). It is interesting in this light

that a rise of Asteraceae (in Zone 6) is associated
not only with a rise of grasses and some ruderals
(e.g., Chenopodiaceae), but also with a rise of
secondary arboreal elements (e.g., Myrica). A
limited co-variation of Carya with Pinus and
Stellaria pollen is of further interest, in that
hickory is encouraged by moderate disturbance,
at least in the forests of East Texas (Thorp 1926).
Empirically, highs of Carya occur in phase-lag
after high-amplitude Pinus-Stellaria highs (in
early Zone 3), or in-phase with moderate highs
of this type (in Zone 5).
Finally, a close correlation of deciduous oak
and birch pollen, both in anti-correlation with
pine makes ecologic sense in that droughts
denuding bottomland forests as represented by
oak would produce a greatly reduced birch
pollen response. Indeed, a dependence of birch
upon high average rainfall has also been defined in a COHMAP study of 820 North American pollen analog sites (Bartlein et al. 1986). In
the present study, periods of low rainfall and
high drought frequency express mean Betula
values under 12.0% TLP, while periods of high
precipitation and low drought frequency express
values greater than 12.0% TLP.
Climate and Fire History
Reconstructions of climate based on the Big
Sandy Creek pollen stratigraphy are limited to
relative terms, although within these limits, it
may be reasonably assumed that periods of
higher drought frequency will increase the
frequency and intensity of forest-fires. The
seasonality of fires observed in East Texas reflects
effects of combustibility of ground level vegetation in the later part of the year (Jurney et al.
2000), and importantly, the pollen response of
southern pines is sensitive to increases in
temperature in the winter particularly (Webb et
al. 1987), due in part to a high fire frequency.
Implications of the anti-correlation of the Pinus
and Betula are that fire frequency or extent
increases as forced by low annual precipitation
or high winter temperatures. Of course, the latter
conditions enhance the combustibility of trees in
the season of high fire potential.
Evidence for Holocene fire history at Big Sandy
Creek thus derives largely from the pattern of
oak vs. pine pollen representation, whereby

forest-fires are defined in terms of magnitude
and frequency. Fire magnitude is inferred after
levels of non-tree pollen in general, as well as the
levels of shade-tolerant Stellaria vs. shade-intolerant Asteraceae pollen amongst the herbs
(Table 7). The frequency of fire can be inferred
after AMS dating, which defines the duration of
acute, high-magnitude fires, as well as longer
term changes in arboreal composition which
may define changes in fire-frequency or magnitude over substantive time spans. Both patterns
are understood after modern observations, in
which pine is promoted by fire due to intrinsic
properties of fire-resistance. For example, in the
pine savanna in the Big Thicket National Preserve in southeastern Texas, the growth of pine
and a suppression of mixed-oak hardwood
growth is dependent on fire (Lui et al. 1997).
However, lower intensity fires may do little to
disturb the woodland equilibrium. Thus in
a mixed pine-hardwood forest in Smith County,
northeastern Texas, proscribed burns have produced little discernible effect on the composition
of pine vs. oak (Rideout et al. 2003). In contrast,
Quercus-succession results primarily from the
profuse seedling producing capacities of oaks in
cleared areas (Thorp 1926). This relative recovery capacity of trees of any fire-resistance is
termed fire-resilience.
The equilibrium between pine and oak is thus
characterized as an alternating dominance,
where pine is favored by its resistance to fire
and oak by its ability to expand rapidly into
larger, more contiguous open areas due to profuse
seeding characteristics. Empirically then, an
initial rise in pine more than 3000 yrs ago,
reflecting major fires over a multi-decade period
in Zone 2, is followed by a recovery of oak
achieved after only 80 yrs, according to AMS
dating. After concurrently high Betula values, this
hardwood succession is achieved under mesic
conditions (Zone 3), in which fire frequencies are
low for up to seven centuries. In contrast, Zone 4
produces sustained high pine values from about
300 BC until AD 1000, a long duration when fires
are frequent due to increased climatic dryness,
after low concurrent values of Betula. Later
changes include a rise and fall of Carya pollen
in Zone 5, and a final expansion of Quercus,
Betula, and forbs in Zone 6. The final association

is unusual, in that forb pollen usually rises in
climates of lesser wetness. The latter association
of forbs with mesic indicators thus provides
indirect evidence of anthropogenic impacts on
the pine-hardwood forest of northeastern Texas
(cf. Cooper 1989, Dalle et al. 2000).
Human Impact on Forest Vegetation
Although it is clear after pollen data that the Big
Sandy Creek valley has remained almost completely under canopy in the later Holocene,
herbaceous growth has been encouraged by
acute and chronic fires in Zone 2 and 4 times,
respectively. The early herbaceous flora is shadetolerant, as promoted by light conditions of the
pine canopy. It is also suspected that these early
fires result from drought, as chickweed and pine
pollen both rise in anti-correlation to birch.
Coeval with regional hunter-gatherer cultures,
any human impact on the environment is
probably limited, although it should be noted
that limited prehistoric impacts in forest have
been reconstructed in parts of the southeastern
United States (cf. Buckner 1989 and Delcourt et
al. 1986).
Pollen Zones 5–6 at Big Sandy Creek provide
better evidence for human impact on regional
forests. Firstly, a hickory maximum in the former
zone is suggestive, as growing populations
evidenced in coeval archaeological finds would
have required an increase of plant food yields.
An increase in hickory nut yields in particular
could have been achieved through the burning
of selective trees and the pollarding of hickory,
sylvicultural activities which have ethnographic
analogs (Delcourt and Delcourt 2004). Indeed,
Carya finds from East Texas Caddo sites (Story et
al. 1990) indicate that hickory nuts comprised
a major part of the diet. In the latter Caddo
period (cf. Zone 6), clearings are probably larger,
as emergent herbs more heliophytic in character.
These plants, including Asteraceae and Gramineae, as well as (ruderal) Chenopodiaceae are
also promoted by a more severe disturbance of
forests, while ruderals in particular are associated with places of human settlement (cf. Schauwecker and MacDonald 2003, Behre 1981, Albert
2004b, Peacock and Reese 2003, and Behre and
Kučan 1986). In this vein, ethnographic accounts indicate that Caddo settlements of the
Contact period are often associated with prairie
formations (in non-limestone zones) of adjacent
regions. For example, at Spirit Lake in southwestern Arkansas, prairies occurring in Caddo
settlement zones exceed three square kilometers
(Hemmings 1982). In the light of a rise of forbs
in Zone 6, high rates of coeval sediment
accumulation are of comparative interest. These
data comprise an independent line of evidence
June 2007

in support of an anthropogenic origin of clearings, as erosion and accumulation is enhanced
emphatically by land clearance and farming.

SUMMARY Slack-water deposits by Big Sandy
Creek in northeastern Texas are shown to
contain well-preserved pollen assemblages of
a high level of stratigraphic integrity. A vegetation history reconstructed from this site furthermore makes ecological sense in terms of inferred
inter-actions of climate, fire, and human impacts on the environment. Within this sequence,
it is proposed that a higher fire frequency
promotes pine and shade-tolerant herbs (esp.
chickweed) in regional forests, while a different
composition is evident in larger clearings, which
contain members of the Andropogon-Stipa association. In general, oak vs. pine prominence in
the regional forests has been shown to be
primarily dependent on relative moisture conditions in the valley after birch pollen response
levels. Indeed, earlier fires inferred after high
pine pollen levels occur exclusively with low
birch pollen levels, indicating that drought
promotes most fires. Later clearances in the
forest are more clearly anthropogenic in origin,
and emerge in spite of higher moisture-levels
inferred from pollen data. Although further
pollen-based studies will be needed before the
role of land-use, fire, and climate history in
forest development can be fully defined, the
present study does demonstrate the potential of
selective alluvial sites towards the reconstruction
of a regional natural history.
