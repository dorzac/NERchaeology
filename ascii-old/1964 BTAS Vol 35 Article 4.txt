Indian Skeletal Material from
the Jim Arnold Site
THOMAS W. MCKERN
ABSTRACT
Two partial human skeletons, a male and a female, were found at the Jim Arnold
Site. Cranial measurements and observations are discussed, and comparisons are
made with skeletal material from other T exas Indian sites.

INTRODUCTION

Skeletal material taken from the Jim Arnold Site ( 41 HL 2) consists of two burials, each containing the remains of one individual.*
Methods employed to describe these two burials are those in standard
use by American physical anthropologists. The data were recorded
on the standard anthropometric blanks used in the Department of
Anthropology, The University of Texas. Identification of age and
sta lure was aided by the most recent techniques of McKern and
Steward ( 1957 ), and Trotter and Gieser ( 1958 ). Due to the generally
poor condition of the postcranial material for both burials, only cranial
measurements and observations will be considered in detail.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION

BuRIAL 1 (Catalogue No. 2133 )
Burial 1 is represented by both cranial and postcranial material. The
bone is in good condition but unfortunately the skull and most of the
postcranial skeleton is incomplete. The individual can be identified as
a young female in her early twenties. Cranial measurements and
indices are shown in Table 1.
Although not complete, the metric and morphological observations
demonstrate a fairly short, gracile somatotype of moderate proportions. Alveolar prognathism is pronounced. Both maxillary and man-dibular dentition deserve special attention. Wear for both arcades is
excessive for a young adult, even under Texas Indian standards.
• For a description of the Jim Arnold Site and the artifacts associated with the
burials, see Curtis Tunnell's article in this issue of the Bulletin.

Crowding is exceptional, especially in the maxilla where this condition
is accentuated by the presence of an extra medial incisor. The tooth
is not present but from the conformation of the alveolus it seems likely
that it was peg shaped. Both mandibular third molars are impacted
and have extensive abcesses at the root level.
Slight lipping of the anterior margins of the fourth and fifth lumbars demonstrates the only bone pathology.
BuRIAL 2 (Catalogue No. 2134 )
Burial 2 is that of an adult male in his middle thirties. A complete
skull in excellent condition (Fig. 1) with some fragmentary postcranial material represents the remains of this individual. Table 2
shows the cranial measurements and indices.
The general cranial picture reflects an individual with a long, narrow
head, high vault, a short but wide face, wide nose, and low rectangular
orbits. It is interesting to note that the combination of narrow vault
and short, wide face with rectangular orbits is one that was diagnostic
of the late Paleolithic populations of :Europe. Dolichocranies sharing
such disharmonic proportions are not common among known samples
of prehistoric Texas Indians. Table 3 demonstrates the unique position
of this individual when compared to other Texas crania.
Lipping of the lower lumbar anterior borders represents the only
pathology.

known, or a new morphological strain not yet witnessed in Texas cannot be decided at this time. It must be remembered that we know very
little about the prehistoric populations of Texas and accentuating new
morphological types or intrusive biological elements on the basis of
isolated discoveries is certainly premature.
Burial 2 remains an interesting case and as our knowledge of early
populations in the same geographic area and similar time period begins
to accumulate, our ability to interpret its importance will become more
realistic.
