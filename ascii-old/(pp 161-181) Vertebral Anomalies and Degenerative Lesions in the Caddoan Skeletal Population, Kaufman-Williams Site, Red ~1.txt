Vertebral Anomalies and Degenerative Lesions in the
Caddoan Skeletal Population, Kaufman-Williams
Site, Red River County, Texas

Carol J. Loveland

ABSTRACT
Vertebral anomalies and degenerative lesions, including spondylolysis,
Schmorl’s nodes, osteoarthritis, and osteophytosis are evaluated in 54 adult
Caddoan skeletons from the Willams part of the Kaufman-Williams site
(41RR16), Red River County, Texas. The anomalies are considered as possible
effects of known sex-specific activity patterns. Males have a higher frequency
of spondylolysis and Schmofl’s nodes and an earlier onset and more severe
evidence of osteophytosis and osteoarthritis of the vertebral articular facets,
suggesting early, intense physical activity. Comparisons are made with other
Caddoan populations.

INTRODUCTION

Congenital, developmental, and degenerative anomalies are frequently
noted on the vertebral column. These conditions reflect the genetic inheritance
of the individual and the effect of lifestyle and environmental stress on the
skeleton. In this paper, vertebral characteristics and anomalies observed in
Caddoan skeletal material from the Williams part of the Kaufman-Williams~ site
complex are documented and discussed. The anomalies, which occur with different frequency in males and females, may reflect sex differences in division of
labor. Comparisons are made with information provided about other Caddoan
populations. Ethnohistorical accounts, archeo!ogical reports, and
paleopathological data will then be used to interpret the prehistoric Caddoan
lifeway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This paper reports on research conducted on vertebral columns from 26
male and 28 female Caddoan skeletons from the Williams part of the KaufmanWilliams site (41RR16), Texas. The Kaufman-Williams site is located on the
southern bank of the Red River in northern Red River County.
The Williams part of the site, which was occupied from approximately
A.D. 1550 to 1700, was excavated by Gregory Perino for the Museum of the
Red River, Idabel, Oklahoma, between 1977 and 1979. The skeletal material is
now part of the University of Tennessee collection (Loveland 1980).
Methods used to determine age and sex of the skeletons are discussed in
Loveland (1980, 1984, 1985, 1988). The adult age distribution is presented in
Table 1. The number of vertebral elements available for examination is presented in Table 2.
The vertebrae were placed in correct anatomical position and examined for
the following features: spondylolysis, Schmorl’s nodes, osteophytosis, and
osteoarthritis. The presence of lipping (osteophyte development) indicated the
presence of osteophytosis. In addition to lipping, the author used porosity, erosion, and eburnation (polishing) to classify osteoarthritis of the vertebral articular facets. The scoring procedure for both conditions was the same: + = slight,

++ = moderate, and +++ = severe. The author evaluated all conditions and
anomalies on the basis of age, sex, and laterality.
Comparisons are made with data from other Caddoan populations, including reports by Butler (1969), Rose et at. (1981), and Rose (1984). Butler (1969)
reported on 23 skeletons from the Kaufman portion of the Kaufman-Wittiams
site. These burials were from three time periods: ca. A.D. 1000-1300 (Burial 1),
A.D. 1300-1500 (Multiple and Shaft Burials), and A.D. 1500-1740 (Burial 6).
All of the burials were reported as a single population, however, and since
fifteen burials dated to about A.D. 1300-1500, the data mostly reflect that time
period (Skinner et al. 1969).
The Roden site (Perino 1981) is located 2.8 km northeast of the KaufmanWilliams site on the north side of the Red River. Three periods of occupation
occurred between A.D. 1300-1650. The majority of the skeletons, which dated
to about A.D. 1500, were treated as one sample while the small number of
remaining skeletons, which dated to the early occupation (A.D. 1300) and the
late occupation (A.D. 1650) and included many potted burials, comprised a
second group (Rose et al. 1981). Only those skeletons which dated to about
A.D. 1500 are used for comparative purposes in this study.
Perino (letter from G. Perino to C. J. Loveland, July 23, 1990, on file Utah
State University, Logan, Utah) suggested that the people living on various parts
of the Kaufman-Williams site and at the Roden site probably represent a single
population which moved from one area to another when the soil was exhausted
or when the river changed course. Although the skeletons from the Kaufman
and Williams parts of the Kaufman-Williams site and those from the Roden site
probably represent a single population through time, this paper deals specifically
with the skeletons from the Williams part of the Kaufman-Williams site since
the other skeletons were examined by other researchers using different methods.
Comparisons with those groups are made when possible, however.
The Cedar Grove site is located along the Red River in Lafayette County,
Arkansas. Both historic and aboriginal components were located; the aboriginal
occupation included Caddo IV (ca. A.D. 1500-1700), and Caddo V (after A.D.
1700) occupations (Trubowitz 1984). Fifteen burials (six males, three females,
and six subadults) and eight isolated finds of human bone from nonburial areas
were recovered. Two of the three females were over 45 years old; five of the
males were over 35 years of age.

ASPECTS OF CAI)DOAN LIFEWAY

According to ethnohistorical accounts, the Caddoans relied upon both domesticated plants and wild plants and animals for their food (Newcomb 1958;
Griffith 1954). These reports have been substantiated by archeological recovery
of maize, two varieties of beans, squash, gourds, and sunflowers as cultigens

Loveland ~ Kaufman. Williams Caddoan Skeletal Population

165

and the remains of wild plants such as hickory nuts, black walnuts, hazel nuts,
and persimmons. In addition, cane, used for tools and/or as a building material,
has been found on Caddoan sites (Wyckoff 1980; Skinner et al. 1969; Webb
1959; Stewart 1981; King 1984).
By using the faunal skeletal elements recovered at sites to calculate the
amount of meat available, archeologists have established that white-tailed deer
was of primary importance to the Caddos (Parmalee and Opperman 1983;
Henderson 1978; Skinner et at. t969; Hemmings 1982; Styles and Purdue 1984;
Parrnalee and Bogan 1981). Henderson (1978) suggested that the range of deer
bones present indicated that the entire animal was returned to camp for butchering. Small mammal, bird, amphibian, reptile, and fish bones were also recovered
(Parmalee and Opperman 1983; Hemmings 1982; Parmalee and Bogan 1981).
Swanton (1942) reported that bison hunting occurred in the wintertime and
assumed greater importance through time. Bear hunting yielded fat, used for
flavoring in cooking (Swanton 1942).
The Caddoans practiced a sexual division of labor. Griffith (1954:50) states:
Even when they were engaged on a common project, the two sexes
worked separately. The women planted, cultivated, harvested, and
stored the crops; collected food from natural sources; prepared the
meals; gathered fuel; and attended to all the other details around the
house. The men were employed chiefly in hunting, but they also performed the heavier routine living tasks such as breaking and preparing
the soil for planting, and constructing houses.
House construction was predominantly a male activity and involved erecting posts in a circle and stabilizing the roof with interior supports. Women cut,
carried, and placed the grass thatch used on the exterior surface (Hatcher 1927).
Preparation of the fields for planting was a communal project. Males cleared
and broke the soi! with hoes made of seasoned walnut or hickory. Women were
responsible for all aspects of the domestic food supply after initial soil preparation (Swanton 1942; Glover 1935).
Perhaps one of the most strenuous activities performed by the women was
grinding maize. Wooden mortars were made by burning the center of a large
log. The pestle, also of wood, was about six feet long. A rounded-off end
crushed the grain while the shaft and top provided additional weight and force in
the pestle’s descent. Two to four women worked together, each striking a pestle
into the mortar in a rhythmic pattern (Swanton 1946).
Griffith (1954) reported that witnesses who observed the women working
around their houses described them as little more than drudges. However, he
later stated,
In view of the evidence, it seems that a not inequitable division of labor
existed between men and women. That of the women was probably

166

more incessant and more monotonous but that of the men was perhaps
no less indispensable (Griffith 1954:122).

SPONDYLOLYSIS
Spondylolysis is a vertebral separation involving the interarticular area, the
pedicle, or the lamina (Figure 1). Four males (15.4 percent) and two females
(7.1 percent) from the Williams part of the Kaufman-Williams site had
spondylolysis, and adults of all ages were affected (Table 3). One male and one
female had bilateral separation at pars interarticularis; the bilateral separation in
one male skeleton occurred posterior to the transverse processes. One female
had separation on the right side at pars interarticularis on T12. Unlike the other

Figure 1. Spondylolysis usually occurs at the pars interarticularis (A) although it may
occur through the pedicle (B). The fourth or fifth lumbar vertebrae are most commonly
affected.

cases of spondylolysis, a considerable buildup of new bone accompanied this
defect. It is possible, therefore, that this separation was of traumatic origin.
The separation occurred on the left side at pars interarticularis on two male
skeletons. One of these individuals was a 20-25 year old male who had a
congenital hip dislocation on the right side. This anomaly affected all of the leg
and foot bones as well as the vertebral column, and the stresses imposed upon
the vertebral column by the hip defect may have resulted in spondylolysis.

168

Spondylolysis was not reported in the comparative populations (Butler 1969;
Rose et al. 1981; Rose 1984).
According to the clinical literature, spondylolysis appears to be very rare in
children before they learn to walk. It then increases in frequency, but not at a
regular rate. The sharpest increase appears to occur during middle to late adulthood (Merbs 1983). The condition seldom occurs except in the lumbar region
with the fifth lumbar being most frequently involved (Moreton 1966). Nathan
(1959) reported that the neural arches in the lower lumbar region transmit the
compressive forces of the spinal column, whereas in the upper column the
forces are directed through the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs. Thus,
the differential thrust on the lower lumbar region creates stresses which lead to
the development of spondylolysis in the lumbar vertebrae.
Although the condition was first thought to be congenital, a variety of
evidence has since disproven this theory. Spondylolysis also lacks the characteristics of a true fracture, including evidence of attempted repair. Nathan (1959)
attributed the lack of bone repair to the persistence of the stiesses responsible
for the initial lesion.
Spondylolysis is currently believed to be of developmental origin; however, there may be a genetic predisposition since affected individuals frequently
exhibit other abnormalities as well (Roche and Rowe t952). Furthermore, Wiltse
et al. (1975) showed that the incidence of spondylolysis was higher in families
of affected patients. Although he could not isolate the exact mode of inheritance, he felt the trait was recessive and sex-linked. On the other hand, WynneDavises and Scott (1979) postulated autosomal dominant inheritance for
spondylolysis; however, the genetic predictibility factor was below expected
values. They attributed this to the action of several genes, or to reduced penetrance, which means that the effect of the gene may be quite variable, sometimes resulting in the condition passing unnoticed.
Vertebra! morphology may predispose certain individuals to the condition.
Nathan (1959) noted that large superior and inferior articular facets crowd the
isthmus in afflicted columns, making separation more likely. A narrow isthmus
is more susceptible to separation than a wide one.
In an attempt to evaluate morphological features of the vertebrae which
might lead to the development of spondylolysis, Stewart (1956), who attributed
spondylolysis to stress, found several characteristics that occurred in slightly
greater frequency in affected individuals. These strain-related features included
a long prearcuate spine, an acutely inclined proximal sacral surface, increased
lumbar lordosis, and reduced depth and curvature of the superior sacral articular
facets.
Structural weakness of a vertebra increases the likelihood that a fatigue
fracture might develop as a consequence of strenuous activity or lifting of heavy
objects. In a study of the bony structure of the neural arch, Krenz and Troup
(1973) found that changing posture varies the shearing forces affecting the

Loveland w Kaufman. Williams Caddoan Skeletal Population

169

articular processes and, hence, the amount of stress placed on pars
interarticutaris. While Stewart (1953) attributed spondylolysis in Eskimos to
their practice of working in stooping positions, Krenz and Troup (1973) suggested that activities such as running, jumping, or marching, which impose
repetitive lateral flexor movements on the extended spine, would be most likely
to create the stresses leading to the condition.
Wiltse et al. (1975) reported that 13 of 14 patients with spondylolysis had
participated in vigorous athletics at the time back pain started. They attributed
the defects to fatigue fractures, which differ from other fractures in that: (a) the
defect seldom heals, (b) periosteal callus formation seldom occurs, (c) there is a
hereditary predisposition, (d) it develops following repeated minor trauma, and
(e) it occurs at an early age.
In a comparison of spondylolysis occurrence in Archaic and Mississippi
period populations in northwestern Alabama, Bridges (1989) noted a much
higher incidence in the Archaic group. She suggested that different activity
patterns caused the disparity. Although males and females were equally affected
by the anomaly, the condition developed earlier in the males. Bridges (1989)
postulated that osteoporosis among older females may have led to weakening of
pars inarticularis, whereas strenuous motion or unusual postures may have led to
earlier development of the condition in the males.

SCHMORL’S NODES
Schmorl’s nodes result when the nucleus pulposus herniates into the body
of a vertebra. The herniation is believed to result from developmental defects in
the cartilage between the disc and the cancellous tissue of the vertebral body.
Often these nodes represent the channels through which blood vessels once
supplied the disc. Typically Schmorl’s nodes are asymptomatic; however, extremely large nodes may cause the disc to narrow and impede the growth of the
vertebral bodies causing kyphosis (Hollinshead 1982).
Six males (38.5 percent) and two females (14.3 percent) had Schmorl’s
nodes (Table 4). One male had nodes on two vertebrae and two separate nodes
on the superior surface of the sacrum, while a female had nodes on three
vertebrae. The youngest individual was 17-19; the oldest was 45+. Five of the
six males with Schmorl’s nodes were 30-35 years of age. These individuals
represent 50 percent of the male members of that age category. Schmorl’s nodes
were not documented in the comparative poulations (Butler 1969; Rose et al.
1981; Rose 1984).
Schmorl’s nodes appear more frequently in individuals who have engaged
in unusually hard labor during adolescence (Hollinshead 1982). The individuals
affected in the Williams portion of the Kaufman-Williams population probably

170

Texas Archeological Society

had engaged in strenuous work or exercise activities involving both thoracic and
lumbar vertebrae.
According to Merbs (1983), development of Schmorl’s nodes usually precedes compression fracturing. However, careful examination of the KaufmanWilliams vertebrae produced no evidence of compression fractures.

DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE
Degenerative joint disease of the vertebral column has been differentiated
as osteophytosis and osteoarthritis; different types of articulation are involved in
the development of each condition. Osteophytosis is associated with
amphiarthrodial articulations between the vertebral bodies while the diarthrodial
joints present in the remaining vertebral articulations develop osteoarthritis
(Figure 2). The development of the two conditions is very similar given the
difference in joint structure (Merbs 1983). Osteophytosis develops as a result of
tension in the ligaments; the greatest periosteal bone formation occurs in vertebral segments which have considerable mobility in relation to adjacent segments
(Thieme 1950).
Figure 3 presents the incidence of osteophytosis; percentages were calculated based on the number of vertebrae observed (see Table 2). In both males
and females the lower lumbars, followed by the cervical vertebrae, were most

I observed osteoarthritis of the articular facets on the vertebrae in six males
(23.1 percent) and four females (!4.3 percent), all of whom were over 30 years
of age (Figure 4 and Table 6). Osteoarthritis affected the cervical vertebrae of
males more seriously, with limited erosion in the thoracic and lumbar regions.
Osteoarthritis was pronounced in both the cervical and lumbar areas and to a
lesser extent in the thoracic vertebrae in the females. Interestingly, two females
had osteoarthritis in the mid-thoracic region, whereas male thoracic vertebrae
were only affected in the upper and lower areas. This pattern parallels that already mentioned for osteophytosis. Merbs (1983) noted a similar distribution of
osteophytosis and osteoarthritis among Sadlermiut females from Southampton
Island in Hudson Bay, which he attributed to heavy lifting, including carrying a
child.

Comparative data from other Caddoan populations regarding the incidence
of osteophytosis is limited. Rose (1984) provided the most complete information in his comparison of Fourche Maline, Caddo II (ca. A.D. 1200-1400), and
Caddo IV-V sites with that of the Cedar Grove site in southwest Arkansas. The
incidence of osteophytosis dropped between the pre-horticultural Fourche Maline
populations (18.4 percent) and the Caddo II horticulturalists (11.6 percent);
however, in the later Caddo IV and Caddo V (Cedar Grove) populations the
incidence of osteophytosis rose dramatically, 30.5 percent and 33.3 percent,
respectively. Rose (1984) attributed this increase to activities such as a heavier
agricultural workload or a different pattern of wild food procurement, which
placed greater stress on the vertebrae.
Rose (1984) noted the presence of osteoarthritis and/or osteophytosis on
upper and lower thoracic vertebrae in four of five affected males; this is the
same pattern found in the Kaufman-Williams males. The lumbar vertebrae of
the fifth male exhibited osteophytosis. All of the thoracic vertebrae of two
females were affected with osteoarthritis and/or osteophytosis; the cervical vertebrae of one of those individuals were also involved (Rose 1984).
At the Roden site in Oklahoma, Rose et al. (t981) found a combined
osteophytosis rate of 54.5 percent among ca. A.D. 1500 burials. Vertebrae
exhibited only slight to moderate involvement.

PERCENT AFFECTED
Figure 4. Incidence of osteoarthritis in the Williams portion of Kaufman-Williams

Cervical and lumbar vertebrae were most seriously affected in the females.

Eight adult females (72.7 percent) and five adult males (71.4 percent) from
the Kaufman portion of the Kaufman-Williams site exhibited "lipping and bony
additions" (Butler 1969:131). There were 20 adults in the population: seven
males, 11 females, and two of unknown sex. The lumbar and cervical vertebrae
were most commonly affected. One middle-aged female also had severe pitting
and eburnation on the articular facets of the vertebrae. Fifteen of the 20 adult
skeletons were over 36 years of age (Butler 1969), which is probably the reason

Texas Archeological Society

176

for the high incidence of osteophytosis. The combined osteophytosis rate
(counting those of unknown sex) is 65 percent (Table 7).
The frequency of occurrence of osteophytosis at the Williams and Kaufman
portions of the Kaufman-Williams site and at the Roden site (Period 2, A.D.
1500) is comparable. This suggests similar activity patterns among these Red
River Caddoan populations.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Erect posture and bipedalism, characteristics of all Homo sapiens, produce
spinal stress which may lead to vertebral problems. In addition, pregnancy may
place stress on the lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions. Thus, vertebral
anomalies may develop aside from any particular activities in which members
of a group participate. However, vertebral stresses also result from daily, regularly repeated work activities.
The workload precipitated by heavy reliance upon horticulture resulted in
debilitating vertebral injuries among female food producers (e:g., Rose 1984).
Similarly, Pickering (1984) found that the incidence of arthritis in the upper
back increased among Late Woodland females in the Lower Illinois River valley
as they began to invest more energy in maize cultivation.

Loveland m Kaufman- Williams Caddoan Skeletal Population

177

The manner in which women dried food for storage would also have
created stress on the vertebral column. According to Griffith (t954), the Caddo
dried maize on large outdoor platforms, raised ten or twelve feet above the
ground. The activity of lifting the maize to that height and rotating it frequently
to assure that it dried adequately would have stressed the upper vertebrae.
The women engaged in other regular strenuous activities, including gathering and carrying firewood, carrying water, and, importantly, carrying children in
cradleboards positioned in a way that strained the mid-thoracic vertebrae. Thus,
the women’s daily activities would have initiated rather constant strain upon the
vertebra! column, through a combination of bending, lifting, and carrying.
In contrast, male activities produced somewhat sporadic, but probably
more intense stress on the vertebrae. Clearing and preparing the fields for
planting, using hand implements, was strenuous work involving significant
movement and flexion of the vertebral column. This entailed not only tilling
activities, but also heavy lifting of logs and other debris. Hunting was also a
vigorous activity involving running, walking long distances, and frequently
carrying heavy loads. The intense reliance on white-tailed deer, coupled with
lack of a pack animal, meant that hunters frequently carried considerable weight
for prolonged distances. These tasks produced serious strain on male vertebrae.
These stresses explain the greater incidence of spondylolysis, Schmor!’s nodes,
and earlier development of osteophytosis and osteoarthritis in males. These
conditions all reflect intense strenuous activity.
Evidence of vertebral stress is found in adolescent males as well, suggesting their early initiation into adult male activities. The Caddoan females did not
incur disabilities as early, perhaps because their workload was not as strenuous
or because they did not experience high stress episodes.
Analysis of vertebral anomalies provides information about the stresses
imposed on prehistoric populations. The incidence in Caddoan populations of
osteophytosis and osteoarthritis of the vertebral articular facets, as well as the
frequency of spondylolysis and Schmorl’s nodes, suggest that while the activities of both males and females placed considerable strain on the vertebral
column, the males engaged in the most stressful activities during the period
from about A.D. 1300-1700.
