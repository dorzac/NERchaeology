ABSTRACT

On 27 April 2016, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted cultural
resources investigations within the 16.0-acre Waco Riverfront Property in downtown Waco,
McLennan County, Texas (Project Area). The City of Waco is proposing to allow a private firm
to develop the Project Area into a mixed-use complex of public open space, parking, residential,
entertainment, dining, and high-rise hotel(s). While the development of the Project Area will be
privately funded and will not require any federal permitting, it is located on property owned by
the City of Waco. As the City of Waco is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the
undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of
SCS Engineers (SCS) and on behalf of the City of Waco, Horizon conducted the cultural
resources investigations within the Project Area under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
permit no. 7629 in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the
project had the potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible for formal designation as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs).
The cultural resources survey resulted in the observation of occupational and building
debris layered across the full extent of the Project Area. This debris is undoubtedly associated
with the razing of an area once known as Sandtown, which was an area of downtown Waco that
had been occupied by Waco’s African-American and Hispanic communities for roughly
100 years between the 1860s and 1960s. As part of the Waco Urban Renewal Project, the
area containing Sandtown (and the current Project Area) was systematically cleared and leveled
in the 1960s in an effort to combat inner-city blight. This resulted in the observed layer of
occupational debris, which was used to fill and level the area as well as to build up the terrace
along the southern bank of the Brazos River at this location.
While a considerable amount of occupational debris was observed, these materials were
clearly in heavily disturbed and scattered contexts lacking intact cultural features or clear
associations with any of the structures that had once been present within the Project Area.
Because of this, the overall area was not documented as an archeological site or assigned a
unique trinomial. However, 1 backhoe trench did reveal the presence of what appears to be an
intact debris pit feature associated with the usage of the area during the early to mid20th century. This feature, containing primarily machine-made bottles and bottle fragments,
was documented as site 41ML311. Although this feature does appear to contain a large

number of bottles post-dating 1920, they cannot be associated directly with any of the prior
occupations within the Project Area. Moreover, they provide only a general understanding of
the household waste produced by the occupants of the area. With this mind, it is Horizon’s
opinion that site 41ML311 is considered to be ineligible for formal designation as an SAL. In
addition, due to the modern nature of the recovered bottles and bottle fragments from 41ML311,
none of the recovered specimens were submitted for curation at an approved curatorial facility.
Rather, all 36 specimens were returned to the City of Waco.
Based on (1) the presence of heavily disturbed occupation and construction debris used
as fill material across the entire Project Area, (2) the lack of any intact structures associated with
the portion of Sandtown within the Project Area, and (3) the assessment that the debris pit
feature recorded as 41ML311 is considered to be ineligible for formal designation as an SAL, it
is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the 16.0-acre Waco Riverfront property would have
no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs within the Project Area. Horizon therefore recommends that the
undertaking be allowed to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any human remains or burial features are inadvertently discovered at any
point during development, use, or ongoing maintenance of the property, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of cultural resources investigations conducted within
the 16.0-acre Waco Riverfront Property in downtown Waco, McLennan County, Texas (Project
Area) (Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The City of Waco is proposing to allow a private firm to develop
the Project Area into a mixed-use complex of public open space, parking, residential,
entertainment, dining, and high-rise hotel(s). While the development of the Project Area will be
privately funded and will not require any federal permitting, it is located on property owned by
the City of Waco. As the City of Waco is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the
undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of
SCS Engineers (SCS) and on behalf of the City of Waco, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) conducted the cultural resources investigations within the Project Area under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit no. 7629 in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the
survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if
any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse effects on sites
eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of archival research, backhoe trenching
efforts within the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State
Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell K.
Brownlow (Horizon’s Cultural Resources Director) served as the project’s Principal Investigator
and conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations within the Project Area on
27 April 2016. This entailed intensive surface inspection across the property as well as
mechanical backhoe trenching efforts. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 backhoe trench per 2.0 acres for projects
measuring between 11.0 and 100.0 acres in size. With this in mind, a minimum of 8 backhoe
trenches were necessary within the 16.0-acre Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS.
With the assistance of SCS personnel, Horizon excavated 6 backhoe trenches within the Project
Area. This data was further supplemented with data gathered by SCS from 40 other backhoe
trenches excavated during their soil assessment efforts within the Project Area. Overall, the
TSMASS were exceeded with the excavation of a total of 46 backhoe trenches by Horizon and
SCS.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area is located near downtown Waco in central McLennan County, Texas
(see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Waco West, Texas, and Waco East, Texas topographic quadrangle maps (see Figure 1-1). The
City of Waco is proposing to allow a private firm to develop the Project Area into a mixed-use
complex of public open space, parking, residential, entertainment, dining, and high-rise hotel(s).
The Project Area is situated on the southern bank of the Brazos River, due west of the
Interstate Highway (IH) 35 corridor. The property has been cleared in the past for use as
parkland. However, a fire station and associated fire rescue training tower are located within
the central portion of the Project Area. Representative images of the Project Area at the time of
the cultural resource assessment are presented in Figures 2-1 to 2-4.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located on a relatively flat (modified) terrace on the south bank of the
Brazos River, one of the largest rivers in the state (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). Elevations across
the Project Area are relatively level at approximately 122.0 meters (m) (400.0 feet) above mean
sea level. Hydrologically, the proposed ROW is situated within the Brazos River basin. The
Project Area is drained to the north and northeast via overland sheet flow directly into the
Brazos River.

2.3

CLIMATE

The climate in McLennan County is humid subtropical with a considerable range of
annual temperature extremes. Winters are generally mild, with an average temperature of
47.0 degrees. The summer months are commonly hot and humid, with average daily
temperatures around 83.0 degrees. The average annual total precipitation is about 33.4 inches
(84.8 centimeters [cm]), with roughly 55% falling between April and September (NRCS 2016a).

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

McLennan County is located within the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian

provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird.
Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined racerunner, rat snake,
eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake, copperhead,
western diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog, diamondback water
snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and antelope were
common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are no longer native
to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

Historical background chapters for cultural resources investigations in Texas often
consist of a breakdown of the prehistory of the area spanning roughly the past 12,000 years
followed by sections on the more recent history focusing on the settlement of a specific county
or town. These extensive cultural overviews are included to provide a backdrop of the
prehistory and history of an area upon which the findings of the investigations can be discussed,
even for projects in which cultural assemblages from particular temporal periods were not
encountered. In regard to current Project Area, it is highly probable that indigenous peoples
may have camped along the banks of the Brazos River, especially given the fact that the City of
Waco was founded at the location of a large Waco Indian village. Early Anglo settlers also likely
traversed the area during the establishment of the City of Waco. However, the current
investigations failed to document any cultural deposits directly associated with these early time
periods, so the inclusion of an extensive cultural history is not relevant here. For an extensive
cultural background on the prehistory of Central Texas and the settlement of McLennan County
and Waco, the reader is directed to the Archeological Background chapter in the cultural
resources report of investigations for the nearby Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum
Expansion Project (Bradle et al. 2006).
The Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum is located roughly 182.9 m (600.0 feet)
southeast of the current Project Area on the opposite side of IH 35. Bradle et al. (2006) utilize
numerous sources to develop an extensive and thorough background of McLennan County and
the City of Waco, ranging from the earliest PaleoIndian occupants up through a meeting of
President George W. Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin at Crawford High School in
2001. However, their background fails to mention anything about “Sandtown”, a once-thriving
community that appears to have been present on the banks Brazos River at the location of
current Project Area since roughly the founding of the City of Waco around 1850 until the late
1960s.
Currently, the Project Area primarily consists of cleared and leveled parkland along the
southern bank of the Brazos River. However, a program conducted by the Waco History Project
in the early 2000s gathered oral histories from more than 100 local residents who grew up in the
area and remembered the location as a thriving and “gritty” area of town that was inhabited
primarily by members of Waco’s early Hispanic populations between roughly 1905 and the late
1960s. Terri Jo Ryan, a staff writer for the Waco Tribune-Herald, penned several articles about
the Waco History Project’s Sandtown program. These can be found online on the Waco History

(Ryan 2004, 2006) are reproduced below to provide a background for the Project Area from
approximately 1900 to 1960.
Are you from Sandtown?
Rediscovering a vanished piece of the city
By Terri Jo Ryan, Tribune-Herald staff writer
January 20, 2004
Sandtown, a place that exists only in the hearts and minds of its former inhabitants and
their descendants, was brought back to life for an evening through the recollections of
some 100 people from the now-defunct neighborhood who gathered for a program by the
Waco History Project.
Families with names like Fuentes, Ochoa, Sanchez, Martinez, Vasquez, Ramos, Bravo,
Serrano, Torres and Campos were the folks who populated a gritty urban area from 1905
into the 1960s, until the federal Urban Renewal Project wiped clean the area bounded
roughly by the Brazos River, Second Street, Jackson Avenue and Interstate 35.
And several of their descendants swapped stories in the parish hall of Sacred Heart
Catholic Church on Tuesday, at the invitation of Robert Gamboa and other board
members and friends of the Waco History Project. The project is a collaborative effort
among several agencies, institutions and individuals to connect people throughout the
community by telling the stories of Waco's diverse past.
Gamboa, director of development for Texas State Technical College, as well as a former
president of the Waco Chapter of the League for United Latin American Citizens, spent
his childhood in Sandtown, so named because if its proximity to the Brazos River.
From grocery stores and auto garages, barbershops and beer joints, an Assembly of God
sanctuary to a swinging nightspot and gambling hall called "The Blue Moon," the
memories rolled out from a crowd who needed very little goading to get started with the
storytelling.
One man recalled watching his neighbors go fishing by casting a line out their bedroom
window—they lived that close to the water's edge. One woman said she remembered
how 70 families shared a single water faucet under a tree for all their needs. A man told
of buying kerosene in bottles, the only way to light the house or heat food at home.
Another woman laughed at the nickname of her street: "La via de las tripas," or "Guts
Way," so called because it was the location of a slaughterhouse, meatpacking plant,
cowhide tannery and a cemetery.
Many families kept pigs in their back yards, and at least one kept a cow in the front yard.
Another woman recalled how much her family struggled to stay afloat economically, even
though the rent was only $7 per month on their home.
Society put them there, and poverty kept them there, Gamboa noted. For many of these
immigrant families the story of many first generation Americans, he added as soon as
they approached affluence, they moved out of the old neighborhood into other areas of

12

160051 AR_Final Report with Appendix A.doc

Cultural Resources Investigations within the
16.0-acre Waco Riverfront Property in Waco, McLennan County, Texas

Waco. Some of the sturdier homes were re-located to other neighborhoods and given
brick facades, he recalled.
Gamboa said he was pleased to see people hunting through family photos for evidence
of Sandtown in their personal past.
"We can document through the families" what may be difficult to uncover in writing, he
said.
He also took delight in the appearance of Lenny Englander, whose family owned
Sunbright Paper Co. in the heart of Sandtown from 1926 to 1978. Englander elicited
roars of laughter reminiscing about Cisto Martinez, a truck driver who seemed to lose his
vehicle in the river with some frequency because he'd forget to "park" it with a brick under
the tire to keep it from rolling.
"I don't know how many times we had to pull him out of the river," Englander said.
Thomas L. Charlton, director of the Texas Collection at Baylor University, had news for
the audience who thought Sandtown had disappeared into the annals of time. Charlton
said the Texas Collection is in possession of photographs and records of Sandtown via
archives from the Waco Urban Renewal Project, the 20 year, $125 million renovation of
the city's urban core begun in 1958 to deal with the problem of inner-city blight.
Federal requirements of the funding called for photographing and recording each
property to be removed, he said. Although many records were damaged in a basement
flood years ago, almost 80 percent of the records are intact. They have not been
processed or indexed yet, but Charlton invited Sandtown's heirs to make appointments to
search the files and other archival materials to help them re-create the virtually unknown
chapter of local history (Ryan 2004).

Ryan (2004) indicates that Sandtown was roughly bounded by the Brazos River, Second
Street, Jackson Avenue, and IH 35. The current Project Area coincides with roughly the
northern half of this area (Figure 3-1). Several years later, in 2006, Ryan penned a second
article about the Sandtown oral history project.
Digging for Oral Histories
By Terri Jo Ryan Waco Tribune-Herald
March 5, 2006
Before the lore of Sandtown slips away, a cadre of Waco historians and helpers came
together to catch some if [sic] it in the Sandtown Oral History and Photo Day.
In the parish social hall of Sacred Heart Catholic Church, scores of professional
historians and student history buffs—fortified by two days of specialized training—came
to learn from the natives and neighbors of those who called the now vanished community
their home.
Sandtown was the gritty urban area that, from 1905 through the 1960s when the federal
Urban Renewal Project wiped out the spot, was located in an area bounded roughly by
the Brazos River, Second Street, Jackson Avenue and Interstate 35.

The Hispanic neighborhood was home to a Mexican-American immigrant community that
was served primarily by St. Francis on the Brazos Catholic Church. It had, by many
accounts at a preliminary community open house almost 14 months ago, grocery stores,
auto garages, a cemetery, barber shops, taverns, an Assembly of God sanctuary and a
gambling hall/nightclub called "The Blue Moon." Other businesses of the era included
the Sunbright Paper Co. and three meat packing plants as well as one major
slaughterhouse.
Sonya Maness, 21, a Baylor University junior majoring in archeology and museum
studies, said she is working on a project about the meat-packing businesses of
Sandtown. She has identified two of them—Rutland Meat Co. and Waco Packing Co.
The whole area was zoned for industrial use, she added. What she found most

fascinating in her research was that Rutland in the 1950s was owned by a woman, most
unusual for [the time?].
Baylor cultural anthropology and historical archaeology students conducted the oral
interviews and prepared the artifacts from Sandtown[‘s] past for public viewing.
Jennifer Kidd, 21, a Baylor senior studying archeology and psychology, took charge of
cleaning up the artifacts, unearthed in a 1980s dig in the land near what is now the
Mayborn Museum.
"It involved a lot of soaking and a little use of a toothbrush," she said of the many bottles
(perfume, soda pop, medicine, cosmetics and hot sauce, to name a few) she scrubbed
free of dirt and debris.
"There was a lot of stuff I'd never seen before, like a tube of shaving cream," she added.
With the help of former Sandtown resident Robert Gamboa, now director of development
for Texas State Technical College, she was able to identify a cigarette-rolling device, the
busted arm of a phonograph and the handle from an old car trunk.
Gamboa, a former president of the Waco Chapter of the League for United Latin
American Citizens, spent his childhood in Sandtown, so named because if [sic] its
proximity to the Brazos River.
"The amount of broken stoneware and china we have is impressive," Kidd added. While
some students focused on taking oral histories from participants, others photocopied
documents brought to the event, or scanned old photos into computer images for the
Texas Collection, a collection of local history archives at Baylor.
The Texas Collection is the keeper of the archives for the Waco Urban Renewal Project,
the 20-year, $125 million renovation of the city's urban core begun in 1958 to deal with
the problem of inner-city blight. Collection director Thomas Charlton recalled that federal
requirements of the funding called for photographing and recording each property to be
removed, so the collection ended up with the photographs and records of Sandtown.
Although many of the records were damaged in a basement flood years ago, almost
80 percent of the records are still intact, but have not been processed or indexed yet, he
said. But at a Sandtown community forum 14 months ago, Charlton invited Sandtown's
heirs to make appointments to search the files and other archival materials to help them
re-create the little-known chapter of local history (Ryan 2006).

In addition to the articles and website prepared to preserve the history of Sandtown, the
Waco City Cable Channel (WCCC-10) took the efforts a step further and prepared a video
entitled “Sandtown: A Vanished Waco Neighborhood” (WCCC.TV – City of Waco 2012). This
online video presents numerous maps and photographs of Sandtown that were gathered during
the Waco History Project’s Sandtown program. These maps and photographs are coupled with
intriguing face-to-face interviews with many of Sandtown’s prior occupants who remember
growing up in the area as kids. This video, as well as several other videos pertaining to the
history of Waco, can be found of the WCCC.TV – City of Waco Vimeo channel

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Ryan’s (2004, 2006) articles note that 80% of the gathered records from the Waco
Urban Renewal Project are still intact within the Texas Collection at Baylor University but have
yet to be processed or indexed. So far, the available oral histories and photographs depict
Sandtown as a primarily Hispanic community that thrived in the area from around 1905 until the
1960s. However, little has been said about the area’s occupants from roughly the founding of
Waco in the 1850s up to 1905. Interestingly, early hand-drawn, panoramic (or “bird’s-eye”)
maps of the City of Waco show that the boundaries of the current Project Area formerly
contained numerous structures, including homes and 2 churches (Figures 3-2 to 3-4). None of
the structures shown within the Project Area on these panorama maps are labeled, making it
difficult to determine exactly what they were. However, an online search of “Sandtown” lead to
a timeline of African-American history in Waco that contained at least one entry that related
directly to the current Project Area:
1881 A four-room frame building at the corner of Clay and River Street, in what was
popularly called Sand Town, becomes the first public school for the black community in
Waco. It is called the Colored School (Waco Messenger 2016).

As this school grew, it later became A.J. Moore High School. It was situated just outside of the
current Project Area boundaries, and its location is still labeled as Moore High School on later
topographic maps of the area (see Figure 1-1). Its probable location is circled on the 1886 and
1892 panoramic maps (see Figures 3-3 and 3-4).
The location of the school in 1881 suggests an African-American presence in Sandtown
that occurred either concurrent with or prior to the Hispanic community. A further review of
available Sanborn fire insurance maps for the location during the late 1800s added additional
evidence of this. While these maps are not complete for the entire Project Area, the available
sheets provide considerable information pertaining to the structures that were present between
1885 and 1899. The earliest Sanborn map (1885) contains only a sliver of the area along
Jackson Street, northeast of 2nd Street (Figures 3-5 and 3-6). This map shows numerous
dwellings, several female boarding houses, and several businesses, including a cobbler and a
grocery. The largest structures mapped are 2 churches. The church situated at the corner of
2nd and Jackson streets is labeled as “Colored. Presby’n Church,” while the second church to
the northeast of the intersection of 1st and Jackson streets is labeled as “M.E. Church.
Colored.” The Presbyterian Church is visible on all 3 early panoramic maps (1873 to 1892),
while the Methodist (M.E.) Church is not present on the panoramic maps until 1886 (see
Figures 3-2 to 3-5).
The 1889 Sanborn maps also only contain the northwestern portion of the current
Project Area, but several more labeled structures are present. The 2 churches are now labeled
as “African Presbtn Church” and “African M.E. Church”. In addition to these there are numerous
structures labeled as “Negro Tenements” and 2 larger structures labeled as “Negro Schools”
(Figures 3-7 and 3-8). These schools are located southwest of the intersection of 1st and
Webster streets, so they appear to be separate from the first “Colored School” located nearby at
the intersection of Clay and River streets.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

The 1893 Sanborn maps depict considerably more activity in the area (Figures 3-9 and
3-10). While the Methodist Church is no longer present, being replaced by an area labeled as
“gravel pits,” several additional businesses are present, including another grocery, a barber, a
carpenter, a meat market, the “Geyser City Ho.” (assumed to be a hotel or house), and “The
Bellwater Co.’s Pump Ho.” (assumed to be a pump house). The dwellings on these maps are
all still predominantly labeled as “Negro Dwellings” or “Negro Tenements.” Probably the most
unique structure new on the 1893 map is a building at the corner of Webster and 1st streets
labeled as “Natatorium for Negroes.” Subsequent to the discovery of artesian wells below Waco
in the 1890s at a time when Waco was aspiring to be known as “Geyser City,” Waco’s first
natatorium (indoor swimming pool) was built by Tom Padgitt in 1891 near 15th Street and Clay
Avenue. In 1892, Joel Robinson constructed Waco’s natatorium at the Corner of Webster and
1st streets for Waco’s black residents (Ryan 2012). The adjacent Bellwater Company Pump
House likely supplied the water for this indoor pool. Sadly, Robinson’s natatorium was
destroyed by fire in 1894.
Finally, the 1899 Sanborn map is very similar to the 1893 version, although there are
several obvious changes. The natatorium is no longer present after being destroyed in 1894,
and a large warehouse for the Water Pierce Oil Company is now present where the Methodist
Church and later gravel pit were located. Additionally, a “Negro Lodge Hall” is now present next
to the Presbyterian Church near the corner of Jackson and 2nd streets (Figures 3-11 and 3-12).
The relatively recent efforts of the Waco History Project’s Sandtown program revealed a
rich history of the Hispanic population in the area between 1905 and the 1960s. What becomes
clear from the early panoramic and Sanborn maps of Waco is that the area once known as
“Sandtown” also hosted a thriving African-American population that appears to have settled in
the area subsequent to the Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. While it is unclear if the area
was also referred to as Sandtown during these earlier years, the early maps show that it was a
community complete with churches, stores, and small wooden houses much like those
described during the Hispanic era of Sandtown in the 1900s.
The Waco Urban Renewal Project was initiated in 1958 in an effort to deal with inner-city
blight. Despite having at least 100 years of occupational history stemming from the early
founding of Waco, the area containing Sandtown and the current Project Area was cleared of all
structures and leveled into empty city blocks or parkland, much of which is still present today
along the southern bank of the Brazos River. Fortunately, photographing and recording each
property to be removed was one of the federal requirements for the project’s funding, and these
records are contained within the Texas Collection at Baylor University.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of 7 previously recorded archeological sites,
2 cemeteries, 14 historic properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP),
and 2 address-restricted NRHP districts within an approximately 1.0-mile perimeter of the
Project Area (THC 2016). A review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth
map layer indicated the presence of the majority of the same historic properties/districts listed
on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2016). These documented cultural resources
and their distances from the Project Area are summarized in Table 4-1, while their locations
relative to the Project Area are presented in Figure 4-1. No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within the boundaries of the Project Area.
Based on the Atlas database, the vast majority of the Project Area was previously
assessed in 1985 for the then-proposed Brazos Commons Phase I project. This prior
assessment, conducted by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. in support of permits issued by the US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), resulted in the documentation of site 41ML203 (Eureka Gas
Light Works) a short distance to the northwest of the current Project Area. This prior
assessment also noted that the entire shoreline is covered with upwards of 20.0 feet of artificial
fill (Jackson 1985). More recent core samples taken across the Project Area confirmed this by
documenting 9.0 to 20.0 feet of artificial fill over the Project Area. Much of this fill contains
building material debris.

4.2

MAP REVIEW

Historic-era panoramic and Sanborn fire insurance maps revealed that the Project Area
contained dwellings, stores, churches, and other buildings as early as 1873 (see Chapter 3.0).
These structures composed the area known as Sandtown near downtown Waco, which thrived
until the 1960s when it was razed as part of the Waco Urban Renewal Project.

banks of the Brazos River, previous investigations have shown the area to be covered by
upwards of 20.0 feet of artificial fill. Because of this, it is Horizon’s opinion that there exists a
generally low potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of
the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, all structures currently standing within the Project
Area appear to be relatively modern in nature based on a review of Google Earth, suggesting a
decreased potential for historic-era standing structures on the property. The area is known to
contain subsurface historic-era building debris that was used as fill along the banks of the
Brazos River.

16.0-acre Waco Riverfront Property in Waco, McLennan County, Texas

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the cultural resources assessment of the Project Area
on 27 April 2016. This entailed intensive surface inspection across the property as well as
mechanical backhoe trenching efforts. The TSMASS require a minimum of 1 backhoe trench
per 2.0 acres for projects measuring between 11.0 and 100.0 acres in size. With this in mind, a
minimum of 8 backhoe trenches were necessary within the 16.0-acre Project Area. With the
assistance of SCS personnel, Horizon excavated a total of 6 backhoe trenches within the
Project Area. This data was further supplemented with data gathered by SCS from 40 other
backhoe trenches excavated during their soil assessment efforts within the Project Area.
Overall, the TSMASS were exceeded with the excavation of a total of 46 backhoe trenches by
both Horizon and SCS. Backhoe trench locations are presented in Figure 5-1.
SCS’s prior testing had revealed that most areas contained soils that were contaminated
with high levels of lead and other chemicals. During the trench excavations, SCS utilized a
dump trailer in which to place all excavated spoil (Figures 5-2 and 5-3). Subsequent to the
completion of the trench excavation, the spoil was immediately dumped back into the trench.
Due to the contaminated nature of the soils, spoil piles and trench profiles were visually
examined, but soil samples were not handled or screened.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, backhoe trenches,
and cultural materials observed. Standardized forms were completed for each backhoe trench,
including location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts encountered. If any new
archeological sites were recorded, standard site forms were to be completed and filed at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). Similarly, if any previously recorded
archeological sites were assessed, updated site forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
temporally diagnostic cultural materials were collected for eventual curation at an approved
facility. Non-diagnostic artifacts were tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back
where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate.
The locations of all backhoe trenches were recorded via a handheld global positioning system
(GPS) unit utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) map datum. Horizon’s backhoe trench data are presented
in Appendix A, while SCS’s test pit and soil boring data sheets are presented in Appendix B.

6.0 RESULTS

6.1

GENERAL FINDINGS

By and large, Horizon’s assessment found the entire Project Area to be covered by
layers of occupational and demolition debris of varying thicknesses and depths that are
undoubtedly associated with the razing of Sandtown that occurred in the 1960s as part of the
Waco Urban Renewal Project. From a cultural resources perspective, this fill was first noted
when Prewitt and Associates, Inc. conducted an assessment of the property in 1985. In his
letter report, Jackson (1985) notes that the “entire shoreline is covered with a fill deposit up to
20 feet deep in places”. As can be seen in Figure 4-1 of this report, the Prewitt and Associates,
Inc. 1985 survey covered the vast majority of the current Project Area, with only the
southwestern block not being included in those survey efforts.
An initial assessment of the shoreline during the current field efforts quickly confirmed
Jackson’s (1985) assessment of the density of fill material along the northeastern border of the
Project Area, where the shoreline above the Brazos River slopes steeply toward the river
channel. In this area, concrete bulkheads have been constructed to contain the terrace
deposits above a recently constructed riverwalk trail. Despite this, surface erosion and
erosional gullies within the unprotected portions of the slope revealed soil matrices containing
considerable amounts of occupational debris, including bottle fragments, ceramic sherds, nails,
concrete chunks, brick fragments, and a variety of other occupational debris (Figures 6-1 to 63). While it is difficult to ascertain the overall thickness of this cultural debris due to the fact that
much of it was eroding down the slope, a backhoe trench (discussed below) opened at the top
of the slope revealed a jumbled deposit of cultural debris approximately 1.4 m (4.6 feet) thick
within this portion of the Project Area.

6.2

BACKHOE TRENCHES

With the assistance of SCS personnel, Horizon excavated a total of 6 backhoe trenches
within the Project Area on 27 April 2016. In the weeks and months prior to this, SCS had
excavated at least 40 additional backhoe trenches within the Project Area as part of their soil
sampling efforts. In all, the Horizon and SCS field efforts resulted in a total of 46 backhoe
trenches within the Project Area. The resulting profiles of these trenches are presented in
Appendices A and B.

A summary of the observed depths of the cultural materials within the 46 excavated
backhoe trenches is presented in Table 6-1. As can be seen in this table and the trench profiles
in Appendices A and B, cultural materials within fill deposits were observed across the Project
Area within 38 of the 46 excavated backhoe trenches. These materials, consisting of both
domestic refuse and structural debris, ranged from the modern ground surface down to depths
of 243.8 cm (8.0 feet) below surface in some instances. Excluding the 8 backhoe trenches in
which no cultural materials were observed, the depths of cultural materials across the site
averaged between 6.1 and 97.5 cm (0.2 and 3.2 feet) below surface.
The most obvious cultural debris observed within the majority of the excavated trenches
consisted of bricks or brick fragments and concrete chunks (Figures 6-4 to 6-7). Brick
structures are represented with pink coloring on Sanborn maps, and the only 2 brick structures
on the pre-1900 Sanborn maps include the Presbyterian Church and the Water Pierce Oil
Company warehouse. The presence of brick fragments and concrete chunks in almost all of the
excavated trenches suggests that the debris of these structures and potential later brick
structures was systematically spread over the Project Area once they were demolished. Most of
the observed bricks/brick fragments were nondescript orange bricks. However, 1 specimen was
marked with “Texas FBC” and another was marked with “MO FB&C Co. St. Louis, MO” (see
Figures 6-5 and 6-6). While no date was found for the “Texas FBC” specimen, the Missouri Fire
Brick Company opened its first plant in 1882 (Corbet 2016), suggesting a use of this specimen
subsequent to 1882 within the Project Area. In addition to these 2 specimens, a unique coping
or decorative fragment (undated) was also observed (see Figure 6-7).

In addition to the documented building debris, a variety of domestic occupational debris
was also present in the majority of the excavated backhoe trenches. Examples of this debris
are presented in Figures 6-8 to 6-11. As can be seen in these photos, the occupational debris
consisted of broken dish and cup fragments; soda, beer, liquor, food, and medicine
bottles/bottle fragments; and butchered faunal bone specimens (hambones) typically associated
with domestic occupations. Several specimens of flow blue china were noted within the
observed artifact assemblage. Popular for roughly 100 years between the early 1800s and
early 1900s, these specimens could potentially reflect earlier occupations during the late 1800s
in the Project Area (Flow Blue International Collectors’ Club 2016). Similarly, round wire nails,
which were manufactured as early as the 1890s (Visser 2016), could reflect late 19th century
occupations in the Project Area. However, all observed bottle specimens were machine-made
specimens with seams extending to the top of the bottle lips. This characteristic bottle trait postdates 1910 (SHA 2016), and the high percentage of these specimens compared to only
2 observed flow blue specimens suggests that most of the observed debris within the Project
Area dates to the period after 1910.
The sheer amount of cultural debris scattered across the full extent of the Project Area,
coupled with the oral histories and historical maps reflecting the occupation of Sandtown, clearly
show that the Project Area is situated over a horizontal area that once contained numerous
residential dwellings, businesses, churches, and even an indoor swimming pool. However,
urban renewal projects have erased all above-ground evidence of these structures. Moreover,
the razing of these structures, followed by the bulldozing of the leveling of the area to create
parkland, has served to thoroughly stir and mix almost all of the subsurface cultural
assemblages associated with the occupation of the area. While the entirety of the Project Area
could conceivably be recorded as a portion of Sandtown, the area is essentially lacking in any
distinct features, foundations, intact subsurface deposits, or above ground structures that would
make the arbitrary boundaries of the Project Area a meaningful archeological site boundary.
Because of this, it is Horizon’s opinion that the full extent of the debris scatter over the current
Project Area does not warrant the assignment of a formal trinomial (site number) and, moreover,
does not qualify for formal designation as an SAL. However, 1 potentially intact debris pit
feature was encountered during the excavation of BHT 1. Because this pit may reflect an intact
subsurface feature, it was documented as site 41ML311. This newly recorded site is discussed
below.

6.3

SITE 41ML311
General Description

Site 41ML311 consists of a subsurface refuse pit that was originally encountered by
SCS in trench P2-TP9 during their earlier soil assessment trenching efforts.
It was
subsequently reexamined in Horizon trench BHT 1. This feature is located within the block
bounded by South University Parks Drive, Jackson Avenue, Webster Avenue, and what was
once River Road. Specifically, it is located 20.0 m (65.6 feet) northeast of South University
Parks Drive and 49.0 m (160.7 feet) northwest of Webster Avenue (Figures 6-12 and 6-13).
The location is currently a cleared field covered in short grasses (Figures 6-14 and 6-15).

However, its location appears to have once been an alleyway based on the modern topographic
map of the location as well as the earlier Sanborn maps of the location (see Figures 3-6, 3-8, 310, 3-12, and 6-12). There is currently no surface expression of the refuse pit feature at this
location. While there are random bits of debris on the surface, these appear to be associated
with the spreading of the fill material over the property in the 1960s. The pit feature itself is
comprised primarily of glass bottles and bottle fragments within a pit whose upper limits begin at
approximately 70.0 cm (2.3 feet) below surface (Figures 6-16 and 6-17). The lower limit of the
pit appears to be at approximately 120.0 cm (3.9 feet) below surface where either a concrete
slab or bedrock was encountered within SCS trench P2-TP9 and in Horizon BHT 1.
Observed Cultural Materials
SCS first became aware of the refuse pit feature when their soil sampling crew was
excavating SCS trench P2-TP9. When the crew encountered several complete bottles, they
stopped excavation and sent a photograph of the recovered bottles via text message to Horizon
(Figure 6-18). The photograph depicts soda, beer, liquor, and food bottles, as well as a small
ceramic figurine. SCS turned the specimens over to the City of Waco prior to Horizon’s field
efforts. As such, these specimens were not directly examined by Horizon.
Once the Horizon archeologist arrived at the location, the SCS field crew excavated
Horizon trench BHT 1 at the location of SCS trench P2-TP9 to allow for the examination of the
feature. During these efforts hundreds of broken glass bottle fragments were observed in the
excavated trench spoil and within the resulting trench profiles (see Figure 6-16). From within
the midst of the glass fragments, Horizon recovered a total of 16 whole or mostly complete
bottles, 10 bottle bases with potentially diagnostic maker’s marks, and 10 bottle necks having
potentially temporally diagnostic traits. Examples of the recovered specimens are presented in
Figures 6-19 to 6-21, while the analysis of these specimens is provided in Table 6-2.
As can be seen in Table 6-2, 33 of the 36 recovered specimens postdate the
1920s/1930s. Of the 36 dated specimens, 3 possess traits that date them between the latter
half of the 19th century (1850 to 1889) through the 1920/1930s. However, 33 of the recovered
bottle/bottle fragment specimens postdate the 1920s/1930s, suggesting that the debris pit itself
generally postdates 1920. There is a slight chance that this pit was utilized as early as the late
19th century. However, it is highly improbable that such a feature remained active from the late
19th century into the early and mid-20th century within an alleyway of the neighborhood at this
location. Due to this improbability, the feature is assumed to postdate 1920.
Cultural Features
The refuse pit feature was the only clearly defined cultural feature encountered within
the Project Area. This feature comprises the entirety of site 41ML311 as it is currently defined.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Currently, the full horizontal extent of the refuse pit feature has not been delineated.
Horizon’s trench BHT 1 measured 2.8 m in length (north to south), and the bottle zone appears

The SCS boring log for trench P2-TP9 denotes a “broken bottle layer from 2-3 ft” and a
“concrete slab at 4 ft” (see Appendix B). Within BHT 1, Horizon documented the upper extent of
the feature at 70.0 cm (2.3 feet) below surface and the lower extent of the feature at 120.0 cm
(3.9 feet) below surface where concrete or bedrock was encountered. While cultural materials

are present from the surface down to 120.0 cm (3.9 feet) below surface, the upper 70.0 cm
(2.3 feet) appears to be fill material. The vertical extent of the pit feature is considered to be
70.0 to 120.0 cm (2.3 to 3.9 feet) below surface.
Summary
Site 41ML311 was documented as a subsurface refuse pit dating to the early to mid20th century based on temporally diagnostic traits observed on numerous bottles and bottle
fragments collected from its matrices. The feature is situated at a location that was once an
alleyway within the area known as Sandtown, and it likely represents a communal dumping area
for the domestic refuse of the local residents. Although this feature does appear to contain a
large quantity of bottles post-dating 1920, they cannot be associated directly with any of the
specific prior occupations within the Project Area. Moreover, they provide only a general
understanding of the household waste produced by the occupants of the area. With this mind, it
is Horizon’s opinion that site 41ML311 is considered to be ineligible for formal designation as an
SAL.

6.4

BONE IDENTIFICATION

A total of 4 bone specimens were recovered during the excavation of the backhoe trenches
across the Project Area. Two of the specimens were recovered from the Horizon trenches and
2 were recovered from the earlier SCS trenches. The 2 specimens recovered from the Horizon
trenches are clearly butchered (sawn) hambones that reflect discarded food waste (see
Figures 6-7 and 6-8). One of the specimens recovered from the SCS trenches was identified as
the distal (ankle) end of a pig or sheep tibia, also a probable discarded food specimen. The
second specimen recovered from the SCS trenches consisted of a longbone fragment that was
too fractured to readily identify. This specimen was submitted to the Forensic Anthropology
Center at Texas State University (FACTS) for analysis. While FACTS did not identify the genus
or species of the specimen, they did indicate that it was nonhuman in nature (Appendix C). As
3 of the 4 recovered bone specimens were likely discarded food waste, the fourth specimen is
also suspected to be from a domestic animal such as a pig, cow, or sheep. All specimens are
nonhuman in nature and do not represent human interments.

Cultural Resources Investigations within the
16.0-acre Waco Riverfront Property in Waco, McLennan County, Texas

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

On 27 April 2016, Horizon conducted cultural resources investigations within the 16.0acre Waco Riverfront Property in downtown Waco, McLennan County, Texas (Project Area).
The City of Waco is proposing to allow a private firm to develop the Project Area into a mixeduse complex of public open space, parking, residential, entertainment, dining, and high-rise
hotel(s). While the development of the Project Area will be privately funded and will not require
any federal permitting, it is located on property owned by the City of Waco. As the City of Waco
is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations
of the ACT. At the request of SCS and on behalf of the City of Waco, Horizon conducted the
cultural resources investigations within the Project Area under TAC permit no. 7629 in
compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological
sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the
potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible for formal designation as SALs.
The cultural resources assessment of the Project Area consisted of intensive surface
inspection as well as mechanical backhoe trenching efforts. The TSMASS require a minimum
of 1 backhoe trench per 2.0 acres for projects measuring between 11.0 and 100.0 acres in size.
With this in mind, a minimum of 8 backhoe trenches were necessary within the 16.0-acre
Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. With the assistance of SCS personnel,
Horizon excavated a total of 6 backhoe trenches within the Project Area. This data was further
supplemented with data gathered by SCS from 40 other backhoe trenches excavated during
their soil assessment backhoe trenching efforts within the Project Area. Overall, the TSMASS
were exceeded with the excavation of a total of 46 backhoe trenches by both Horizon and SCS.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the observation of
occupational and building debris layered across the full extent of the Project Area. This debris
is undoubtedly associated with the razing of an area once known as Sandtown, which was an
area of downtown Waco that has been occupied by Waco’s African-American and Hispanic
communities for roughly 100 years between the 1860s and 1960s. As part of the Waco Urban
Renewal Project, the area containing Sandtown (and the current Project Area) was
systematically cleared and leveled in the 1960s in an effort to combat inner-city blight. This
resulted in the layer of occupational debris across the entire area that was used to fill and level

the area as well as to build up the terrace along the southern bank of the Brazos River at this
location.
While a considerable amount of occupational debris was observed, these materials were
clearly in heavily disturbed and scattered contexts lacking intact cultural features or clear
associations with any of the structures that had once been present within the Project Area.
Because of this, the overall area was not documented as an archeological site or assigned a
unique trinomial. However, 1 backhoe trench did reveal the presence of what appears to be an
intact debris pit feature associated with the usage of the area during the early to mid-20th
century. This feature, containing primarily machine-made bottles and bottle fragments, was
documented as site 41ML311. Although this feature does appear to contain a large quantity of
bottles post-dating 1920, they cannot be associated directly with any of the prior occupations
within the Project Area. Moreover, they provide only a general understanding of the household
waste produced by the occupants of the area. With this mind, it is Horizon’s opinion that site
41ML311 is considered to be ineligible for formal designation as a SAL.

7.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on (1) the presence of heavily disturbed occupation and construction debris used
as fill material across the entire Project Area, (2) the lack of any intact structures associated with
the portion of Sandtown within the Project Area, and (3) the assessment that the debris pit
feature recorded as 41ML311 is considered to be ineligible for formal designation as an SAL, it
is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the 16.0-acre Waco Riverfront property would have
no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs within the Project Area. Horizon therefore recommends that the
undertaking be allowed to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any human remains or burial features are inadvertently discovered at any
point during development, use, or ongoing maintenance of the property, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the
THC should be notified of the discovery.
