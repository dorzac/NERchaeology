ABSTRACT

Berg Oliver Associates, Inc., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston,
Texas (HRA Gray & Pape), to perform an intensive pedestrian survey on an estimated 39.7
hectares (98 acres) of property proposed for a development in Montgomery County, Texas.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site files search to
identify the presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the project areas. No previous
archaeological surveys have taken place within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) and
previously recorded archaeological sites were not identified within the project area.
Field investigation took place between January 15 to16 and January 29, 2008 and
consisted of pedestrian reconnaissance, shovel testing, and photo-documentation. Subsurface
investigation included the excavation of 47 shovel tests in previously undisturbed and
disturbed areas to depths ranging between 10 to 100 centimeters (3.9 to 39.4 inches). The
survey APE was found to be composed of soils low in archaeological potential.
During the field investigation cultural remains or features were not located within the
survey APE. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is required
and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
Berg Oliver Associates, Inc., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston,
Texas (HRA Gray & Pape), to perform an intensive pedestrian survey on an estimated 39.7
hectares (98 acres) of property proposed for the Auburn Trails subdivision in Montgomery
County, Texas. The goal of the archaeological survey was to determine if the project would
adversely affect any buried archaeological materials within the project’s Area of Potential
Effect (APE).
The Lead Federal Agency for this project is the US Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE), Galveston District. The project was conducted in order to comply with USACE
permitting requirements set forth by 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C - Procedures for the
Protection of Historic Properties (Advisory Council on Historic Preservation [ACHP] 1999).
This Appendix establishes the procedures to be followed by the USACE to fulfill the
requirements set forth in the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. Because the subject property currently consists of privately owned land a Texas
Antiquities Permit was not obtained before fieldwork was undertaken. All fieldwork and
reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the Antiquities Code of Texas)
and federal (National Historic Preservation Act [NHPA]) guidelines.
Fieldwork was conducted by Crew Chiefs Charles Bludau and Kerry McGuire and
Archaeological Technicians Elizabeth Spalding, Jessica Campbell, and Jane Steele under the
supervision of Principal Investigator Tony Scott. The intensive pedestrian survey was
carried out from January 15 to16 and January 29, 2008 and required 53 person hours to
complete. Site file research was completed prior to fieldwork mobilization by Tony Scott.
Report text was written by and graphics prepared by Tony Scott. The report was
edited and produced by Jessica Campbell.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project APE is situated on the Moonshine Hill, Texas, USGS 7.5-minute
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The tract is bound by United States Highway (US) 59 to the east,
an existing residential development Timberlane Acres to the south, and more developments
to the west. The northern boundary of the tract is wooded. Based on aerial imagery the
project APE was once a wooded tract but has recently been cleared of vegetation.

SOILS
The intensive pedestrian survey project area contains soils consisting primarily of
Sorter silt loam (So), Splendora fine sandy loam (Sp), Waller loam (Wa). These soils are
associated with Pleistocene deposits of the Lissie Formation (Barnes 1992). Following is a
summarization of the profiles and characteristics of these soils as described in Abbott (2001),
McClintock et al. (1972), and online at the Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture [SSS NRCS USDA] (2008).
Sorter silt loam (SO) is a deep and poorly drained upland soil formed in silty ancient
alluvial sediment. It is generally found on lower ground and thus remains saturated for long
periods. The soil profile typically consists of a surface layer of gray silt loam 7.6 centimeters
(3.0 inches) deep followed by a layer of light brownish gray silt loam to a depth of 48.3
centimeters (19 inches). This is underlain by light gray silt loam to a depth of 200.7
centimeters (79.0 inches).
Splendora fine sandy loam (Sp) is a nearly level and somewhat poorly drained soil
found on gently sloping uplands of the Flatwoods. The soil is formed out of fluvial and
deltaic coastal plain sediments and has a high water table through winter and spring. The soil
profile typically consists of an upper stratum that is 10.2 centimeters (4 inches) thick of dark
grayish brown fine sandy loam. This is underlain by a 15.2-centimeter (6-inch) thick layer of
grayish brown fine sandy loam with light gray and dark brown mottles and few ironstone
concretions. Underlying this is a 25.4-centimeter (10-inch) thick stratum of mottled
yellowish brown and light brownish gray loam with few ironstone concretions. This overlies
a 5.1-centimeter (2-inch) thick stratum of light brownish gray loam with yellowish brown
mottles and subrounded ironstone concretions.
Waller loam (Wa) is a poorly drained soil found on nearly level uplands. Due to its
poor drainage and permeability characteristics, the soil is typically saturated from November
to March. Crayfish krotovinas are common in the upper 100 centimeters (39.4 inches) and
the matrix of the loam consists of approximately 18 to 30 percent clay, 20 to 40 percent silt,
and 15 percent coarse sand. Typical soil profiles consist of a surface layer of grayish brown
loam 10.2 centimeters (4 inches) deep followed by light gray loam to a depth of 86.4
centimeters (34 inches). This is followed by a layer composed of 70 percent gray clay loam
and 30 percent light gray.

CULTURAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA AND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The Southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin subregions,
which have archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and artifact
types. Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited inland
resources year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the coast.
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in Montgomery County tend to consist of short3

term occupation sites situated on ridges or mounds near stream or river margins. These sites
consist of temporally non-diagnostic scatters, thin subsurface deposits, or suggest the
presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed stratigraphic context. Historic sites
near the project area typically consist of farms or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or
early twentieth centuries.
No previous surveys have taken place within the current APE and few cultural
resource surveys have taken place in the area. Examples within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile)
radius consist of two surveys for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). These
surveys were conducted on US 59 and Farm to Market Road (FM) 1314. A third survey was
conducted for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at the southern end of the
Timberlane Acres. None of the surveys identified cultural remains or historic structures near
the current APE.
No archaeological sites have been previously recorded within the project APE. No
archaeological sites have been recorded within 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) of the project area.
The closest previously recorded sites are located approximately 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) to
the southwest of the project area along the banks of the West Fork San Jacinto River. The
next concentration of sites is located approximately 8.45 kilometers (5.25 miles) to the
southeast where the San Jacinto River meets Lake Houston. These sites primarily consist of
open prehistoric campsites with artifact assemblages of lithic flakes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Prior to fieldwork mobilization site file research and a review of the literature
surrounding the project area was conducted. Based on this information, the intensive
pedestrian cultural resources survey was designed to identify and assess whether any cultural
resources may be impacted by the proposed project.
Literature Review and Site File Research Strategy
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained on-line by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC). Site file research was performed in order to identify all
previously recorded archaeological sites within 1.6-kilometers (1-mile) of the project area, and
all recorded historic structures eligible for NRHP listing located adjacent to the APE.
Intensive Pedestrian Survey Methodology
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of archaeological resources, prehistoric and
historic, within the defined project boundaries.
Archaeological survey methods utilized during the survey consisted of shovel testing,
photo-documentation, and pedestrian reconnaissance. Horizontal control was maintained by
4

the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS) data collector. All actions performed, the
general observations of the surveyor, and the results of survey actions were recorded on a
shovel test form. These forms included information on provenience, survey method, and
cultural materials identified.
Transects were spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart with intensive pedestrian survey on
one transect and strictly reconnaissance survey taking place on the next. This pattern
continued across the project. Shovel tests were placed at 90 meter (295.3-foot) intervals in
areas considered to have a low probability for containing cultural material. However,
sections of the tract that were located on natural landforms or areas considered to have a high
probability for containing prehistoric archaeological deposits were investigated by shovel
testing at 30 to 60-meter (100 to 200-foot) intervals. Shovel tests were placed in a staggered
pattern to maximize test coverage and produce a test grid with approximately 60 meters (200
feet) between tests across transects (Figure 2). In areas where surface visibility allowed for
an examination of the ground surface (i.e. surface visibility greater than 30 percent), a
surface inspection of an area measuring 4 meters2 (43 feet2) was performed at each planned
shovel test location. Shovel tests were also excavated in areas considered likely by survey
personnel to contain intact subsurface deposits regardless of surface visibility. Shovel tests
typically measured 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) in diameter and were excavated to a
maximum depth of 1 meter (3.3 feet) into the underlying substratum, or until culturally sterile
subsoil was encountered. Removed soils were screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth.
Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and the Munsell (2000)
soil color charts. Additional information concerning soils encountered was recorded on
standardized shovel test forms for each excavation.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
The cultural resources survey was designed to assess the potential impact that
construction within the APE might have on resources within the project area. During the
background search, no previously identified archaeological sites or historic structures were
located within the proposed APE or a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project area. The
results of the archaeological field investigation are discussed below.
Archaeological Survey
The proposed APE is to be located in nearly level floodplain with approximately half
of the project cleared of ground cover (Figure 2; Plate 1). Cleared portions of the project
area displayed scattered fragments of burned wood on the surface. Official wetland as well
as areas that were highly inundated, such as the northwest corner of the APE, remained
wooded (Plate 2). Survey of the area was accomplished by transects started along the
southern boundary of the project and followed north. An area totaling approximately 10.5
hectares (26 acres) located in the northwest corner of the APE was highly inundated during
survey. In this area shovel tests were attempted in locations where standing water was not
present. The majority of these were saturated just under the surface and only a small number

of tests were able to be excavated. A portion of the rest of the APE also possessed
characteristics of frequently saturated areas.
A total of 68 shovel tests were attempted over the project. Of that number a total of
47 shovel tests were possible, excavated along 32 survey transects. None were positive for
cultural material. Shovel test profiles varied from those resembling a Splendora series soil
with grayish brown sandy to wet silty loam soils to tests with brown and pale brown fine
sand as characteristic of the other soil series found in the area. Nearly all of the tests
terminated when they encountered the water table. Much of the upper strata contained
burned wood as a result of land clearing activities. Shovel test H01 is representative of the
typical soil profile of the project area (Figure 3). This test consisted of a surface layer of
brown (10YR 4/3) moist fine sand to a depth of 11 centimeters (4.3 inches) followed by a
layer of damp light yellowish brown sand (10YR 6/4) to a depth of 15 centimeters (5.9
inches). This was followed by a layer of damp light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clayey sand
to a depth of 36 centimeters (14.2 inches). Below that was a layer of very pale brown (10YR
7/3) mottled with yellow (10YR 7/6) wet clayey sand to a depth of 46 centimeters (18.1
inches) where the test was terminated at the water table.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an archaeological background literary review and
an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey conducted on approximately 39.7 hectares (98
acres) of property proposed for the Auburn Trails subdivision in Montgomery County, Texas.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site files search to
identify the presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the project area. Previously
recorded archaeological sites were not identified within the project area or within a 1.6kilometer (1-mile) radius.
Field investigation took place from January 15 to 16 and January 29, 2008 and
consisted of pedestrian reconnaissance, shovel testing, and photo-documentation. Subsurface
investigation included the excavation of 47 shovel tests in previously undisturbed and
disturbed areas to depths ranging between 10 and 100 centimeters (3.9 and 39.4 inches). The
water table was encountered in nearly all test pits. This fact along with the following reasons
negates the need for deep testing: all soils located within the survey APE are formed out of
ancient alluvium and therefore considered to be of low archaeological potential (Abbott
2001; Barnes 1992); sites in the region are generally found near existing and abandoned
water channels, neither of which exist within the project APE; and sites in the region are
typically at shallow depths attainable through shovel testing.
During the field investigation cultural remains or features were not located within the
survey APE. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is required
in the proposed APE, and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.
