ABSTRACT
The Trinity River Authority is proposing to construct approximately 80
feet of pipeline for the West Fork Interceptor WF13 segment, and 1.08
miles for the WF10 segment along Hurricane and Cyclone creeks in the
cities of Bedford and Euless, Tarrant County, Texas. WF 13 is situated
south of Tibbets Drive and runs north/south parallel to Hurricane Creek.
WF 10 follows Cyclone Creek, begins north of SH 183, and runs southsouthwest terminating north of SH 10. Only the northern portion of WF 10
above Kynette Drive was surveyed as the creek has been channelized with
concrete from there south. The pipeline from that point south will be
installed by placing it under the bottom slab of the concrete channel. No
cultural resources were found on the disturbed ground surface during the
pedestrian survey nor were any found in the shovel tests that were
concentrated along Hurricane and Cyclone creeks. Due to the negative
results of the pedestrian survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further studies are unnecessary and that the construction of the WF 13 and
WF 10 pipelines should proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
The Trinity River Authority intends to construct approximately 80 feet of pipeline for the
West Fork Interceptor WF 13 segment, and 1.08 miles for the WF 10 segment along of
Hurricane and Cyclone creeks in the cities of Bedford and Euless, Tarrant County, Texas
(Figure 1). Segment WF 13 runs north/south on the west side of Hurricane Creek. The
27” diameter pipe will be buried approximately 10’ to 12’ deep in the center of a 100’
wide construction easement. Segment WF 10 begins approximately 150’ north of SH 183
and heads south along the west side of Wilshire Park following Cyclone Creek along
Eastcliff Drive until reaching Kynette Drive. From here, Cyclone Creek south to the end
of the route has been channelized and lined with concrete. The pipe will range from 15”
to 21” in diameter and will be buried approximately 10’ to 12’ deep within the 100’ wide
construction easement until reaching the channelized portion which will be centered on a
an 85’ wide construction easement.
The cultural resource investigation was required because the Trinity River Authority of
Texas is a political entity of the State of Texas and Texas Antiquities Permit Number
5428 was issued for the archaeological survey. In addition, since the interceptors
segments are to be placed within the waters of the US, they fall within the jurisdiction of
the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Relevant federal legislation
includes the National Historic Preservation Policy Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515),
the National Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended
PL92500 and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission not only will review this report as the State Agency, but also as
the Section 106 review agency.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the natural
setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and previous
investigations surrounding the study area. A chapter on the research design and
methodology employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field
investigation. The report concludes with recommendations followed by the references
cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area lies in the Eastern Cross Timbers of North Central Texas, just east of the
Fort Worth Prairie (Dyksterhuis 1946, Figure 1). The Eastern Cross Timbers is a northsouth trending vegetative community, which is dissected by drainages that flow into the
West Fork and the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. The routes are located along Hurricane
Creek and its tributary Cyclone Creek, both of which drain into the West Fork of the
Trinity River. The Hurricane Creek Watershed extends approximately 4 miles north of
the West Fork. Both of the routes are situated approximately 2 miles up the watershed.
The routes are located above the Woodbine formation, which consists of an
approximately 175 to 250 foot thick layer of Cretaceous-era sandstone, clay and shale
(Bureau of Economic Geology1988).
The routes lie within the Crosstell-Gasil_Rader soils complex, which consists of
moderately well drained upland soils with slopes of 1 to 6 percent (Ressel 1981: General
Soils Map). These soil complexes are composed of highly permeable sandy loams
overlaying strongly acidic clay. The B Horizon for the Crosstell series can lie at a depth
ranging from 4 to 41 inches below the ground surface (Ressel 1981:90).
These soils permit efficient water infiltration, allowing tree roots to penetrate easily, and
provide more moisture to plants (Diggs, Lipscomb, and O’Kennon 1999:46). Due to
these characteristics, the Eastern Cross Timbers physiographic region area is biotically
diverse. In addition to blackjack and post oaks, the area has other woody species like
cedar elm, hackberry, pecan, juniper and mesquite trees. Woody trees are not the only
vegetation in this band of forest surrounded by prairies; there is also a diverse selection of
plants that contribute to the dense brush and open savannahs on either side, which
provided many resources to early inhabitants (Diggs et al. 1999:46). The climate of
Tarrant County is typically mild and is characterized as warm and humid. The average
high temperature is 96˚ in July and the average low temperature is 35˚ in January (Texas
Almanac 1999:264). Tarrant County also averages around 32 inches of rain per year and
has a growing season of 230 days (Texas Almanac 1999:264).

CULTURE HISTORY
Culture History
Prehistoric occupation within North Central Texas dates before 8500 Before Present
(BP), and is identified in the archaeological record by distinctive spear points such as
Clovis, Dalton and Plainview. These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply
buried floodplain deposits along the various forks of the Trinity River in North Central
Texas (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Daniel Prikryl reported that in the Lower
Elm Fork area most of the Paleoindian sites are located on the terraces above the
floodplain (1990:19).
The Early Archaic period 8500-6000 BP coincides with the onset of a drying period in
North Central Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period, and isolated
Early Archaic components have been reported in the area. The Middle Archaic period
6000-3500 BP saw stabilization in the environment that is reflected in current climate
conditions of the oak-savannah and grasslands that are present as the Eastern Cross
Timbers. Middle Archaic sites are typically located on terraces adjacent to the Elm Fork
of the Trinity River rather than on tributary terraces (Prikryl 1990:73).
The population in North Central Texas as shown by site numbers experienced a
significant increase during the Late Archaic 3500-1250 BP. A wetter environment
contributed to the diversity of the Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands, and sites from this
period are typically found on perennial tributaries with a small density along the Elm
Fork. During the Late Archaic, there was a significant increase in the use of quartzite for
the manufacture of Gary, Ellis, Elam and Dallas projectile points, which indicates an
increase in the use of natural resources (Prikryl 1990:76).
Sedentary life ways increased during the Late Prehistoric I period from 1250-750 BP.
The appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow and houses in the archaeological record
coincided with a drier climate. Site density decreased overall and along tributaries during
this period. The percentage of quartzite tools decreased from the Late Archaic, and
diagnostics from this period include expanded stem arrow points such as Scallorn and
Alba (Prikryl 1990:79-83). By the Late Prehistoric II 750-250 BP, there was an increase
in buffalo bones in site deposits and a shift in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell,
Fresno and Washita arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Sites from this
time period are typically found on sandy terraces above the flood plains of major
tributaries (Prikryl 1990:80).
Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been
found in North-Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas and is
possibly due to the Native Americans migrating out of the area because they were unable
to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988:103). Yet archival documents and historic
accounts in North Central Texas demonstrate that Native Americans were still present in
the area into the late 19th century.

Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s the aboriginal inhabitants of North
Central Texas continued to play an infamous if not important role in the history of that
region. Garrett, a well-respected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities
almost depopulated North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than
half" (Garrett 1972:24). According to tradition at least, many Indians of several tribes
roamed Tarrant County until the 1860s. Garrett describes the area in south Arlington,
known as Marrow Bone Springs, as a source of water that Indians had been using for
years (Garrett 1972:58).
Accounts of the Battle of Village Creek provide give the impression of a high Indian
population. On May 24, 1841, a scout for General Edward Tarrant spotted fresh tracks
and an Indian village, whereupon General Tarrant, Captain John Denton, and Captain
Bourland, seeking reprisal for earlier raids, led a charge. The surprise was complete in the
first village, but chasing down fleeing Indians led to a second and third village with still
another in the distance. Tragically, Denton was killed during the fighting.
According to an official report of the battle, there were 225 lodges, which were thought
to house approximately 1,000 warriors, only half of whom were in camp at the time of
attack (Baker and Cage 1962:29). Captured Indians told the soldiers that half of the men
were away tracking buffalo. These did not seem to be temporary camps, because the
report noted about 300 acres planted in corn and extensive supplies of ammunition, arms,
and blacksmith equipment (Baker and Cage 1962:29; Garrett 1972:27). Realizing that
they were outnumbered, the soldiers returned to the Red River.
Coming from a different background of dealing with Indians, President of the Republic of
Texas, Sam Houston, realized rapprochement was a preferred tact. In the summer of
1843, a council with the Indians was called, and in September of that year ten tribes
signed a treaty which was approved by the Senate the following January. The treaty
provided the needed impetus for settlement of several counties in the North Central Texas
area. Controversy over the location of where this treaty was signed has been debated for
years. Bird’s Fort is the most widely accepted location for the signing, but research done
by Arlington historian, Arista Joyner, suggests that Marrow Bone Springs could be the
location (Joyner 1976:1).
The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around
1840, Lonesome Dove and Johnson Station, which were both settled in 1845. Lonesome
Dove, located near present-day Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant
County (Garrett 1972:55). Tarrant County itself was organized in 1850, but it was not
until 1860 that Fort Worth was officially named the county seat, that designation having
been transferred from Birdville (Webb 1952:708). Settlers, however, had been steadily
arriving in the county during those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters
Colony land grants, although only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the
grants (Garrett 1972:57).
In 1849, Major Ripley Allan Arnold was assigned to build a military post on the upper
Trinity in the largely uninhabited geographical region of the Grand Prairie and the

Eastern Cross Timbers. This encampment was established on a high bluff overlooking the
confluence of the West and Clear Forks of the Trinity River. Within a short length of
time, there were about 12 double log cabins near the fort, and life in Fort Town, later to
be known as Fort Worth, definitely had its refinements (Garrett 1972:80).
The fort as a military post, however, was relatively short-lived. Faced with the continual
westward movement of the frontier, it was decided that Fort Worth no longer commanded
a strategic place in the line of defense for settlers. Therefore, in September of 1853,
troops abandoned the barracks and parade ground to the local population, which
continued to grow and flourish.
The Civil War took its toll on Tarrant County's population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. The county's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. The railroad reached Dallas in the
early 1870s, and by 1876, it had reached Fort Worth. It was also in 1876 that Arlington
was founded, halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth at a location just north of
Johnson’s Station (Joyner 1976: 80)
Previous Investigations
Surveys discussed in this portion of the report are plotted on Figure 2. Previously
discussed sites and surveys are not repeated here. All non-referenced data is from the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) (2009).
Two historic maps were used in the assessment of this project. The first is an 1893 Sam
Street’s Tarrant County map; the second is a 1920 soil map of Tarrant County. The map
by Sam Street shows a landscape a world apart from that which we see today. The
relatively undeveloped country is dotted here and there with houses and few roads
bridged the West Fork. At that time, the Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas Railroad (now the
Trinity Railroad) did not exist. Both the Sam Street’s map and the 1920s Soil Map show
owner or tenant houses plotted near the proposed TRA WF 10 and WF 13 routes, but
none were on the actual routes. Today the area surrounding the routes is completely
urbanized.
Extensive archaeological investigations have been conducted within the floodplain of the
West Fork of the Trinity River between Fort Worth and Dallas over the past twenty years
(Peter 1987; Largent, Hunt and Peters 1991; Ferring 1994; Shuanessy, Jurney and
Yedlowski 1994; Ferring and Byers 1996; Ellis 1998; Burson, Hunter, Peter and
Shanabrook 2000; Todd and Skinner 2002, 2003). During these investigations, sites
ranging from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric have been recorded. Prehistoric site
assemblages consist mainly of mussel shell and burned rock concentrations that are
buried less than a meter and up to 4 meters below the surface. These findings demonstrate
that the potential for finding buried prehistoric sites within the West Fork floodplain is
relatively high.

River Legacy Park is a City of Arlington park that extends west from SH 157 (Collins
Street) almost to Greenbelt Road and is situated along the south side of the West Fork
channel. Ferring's survey of the park area (1994) located four prehistoric sites (41TR143146) exposed in the riverbank. He also described the Old Bridge Geologic Section from
the south bank of the West Fork to just east of the Rough Green site (Skinner and Caran
1997; Skinner, Caran and Trask 1999). The Old Bridge section includes four units (A-D).
Unit A consists of laterally accreted sands and silts and is related to the Sanger Allo
formation, which is mid-Holocene in age (10,000 to 5,000 B.P.). A moderately developed
soil with a thick A-horizon is present at the top of Unit A. Unit B consists of calcareous
silts and clays with a prominent buried soil on top of the unit. This has been termed the
West Fork Paleosol. All of the recorded riverbank sites are contained in this unit from
near its top to four meters below the surface. Unit C consists of discontinuously exposed
younger channel fills that are inset onto Units A and/or B. Unit D consists of recent
alluvium that covers all exposures of units B and C.
Two prehistoric sites were located during the survey of a pipeline that crossed the
western part of River Legacy Park and continues north across the river before connecting
with a Trinity River Authority (TRA) pipeline (Skinner and Caran 1997). The Rough
Green site (41TR162) was discovered by shovel testing and was defined using augering
and backhoe trenching. The site is a massive shell midden that contains the only recorded
post hole along the West Fork. A deeply buried prehistoric site, 41TR164, was located by
backhoe trenching. Extensive testing at Rough Green (Skinner, Caran and Trask 1999)
found Late Archaic and Early Late Prehistoric occupations situated along the overbank
levee paralleling Walker Branch before the West Fork absorbed the headwaters of the
creek. It was concluded that the primary function of the site was to collect bur oak acorns,
although evidence of hunting deer and other mammals and gathering freshwater mollusks
was found in the site deposit.
Geo-Marine, Inc. (Tiné 2002) investigated approximately 33 acres west of SH 157
(Collins Street) and north of the West Fork, and in 1990, CMTA investigated a small area
west of Collins Street and south of the railroad track. No archaeological sites were found
in either survey. Approximately 315 acres were surveyed for the Texas Department
Water Resources south of Trammel Davis Road and west of Greenbelt Road in 1983 but
no sites were recorded. South of the study area, AR Consultants (Whorton and Skinner
1995) investigated 275 acres for a golf course and sports complex. During the survey a
historic site, the Tom Coble homestead (41TR153), was recorded.
Sites 41TR139 and 41TR140, east of Collins Street, were recorded during the Mercyhurst
College archaeological survey (Shaunessy, Jurney and Yedlowski 1994). Located in the
uplands, site 41TR139 consists of a surface lithic scatter that contained dart points,
performs and bifaces that were Archaic in age above a perennial drainage while site
41TR140 contained Archaic-aged flakes, dart points, bone and mussel shell buried
approximately a meter below the ground surface.
Site 41TR161 is in the floodplain east of the study area on the north side of the West Fork
(Skinner and Caran 1997:22-23). The site was located 2.55 meters below the surface

during trenching and consists of a burned limestone and sandstone rock hearth. A block
of earth was removed and screened for artifacts but none were found. The site was found
during the placement of four trackhoe trenches along the northern border of the study
area.

Figure 2.

Previous investigations in the vicinity of the study area plotted on portions
of the Hurst and Euless, Texas 7.5’ USGS topographic maps.

In the fall of 2008, ARC conducted a block survey of 105 acres that abut the eastern
terminus of the pipeline, in an area that is now part of the Arlington Landfill (Todd
2008). During the survey, 25 backhoe trenches and 28 shovel tests were excavated. The

survey resulted in the recording of three prehistoric shell lens middens and hearth sites
(41TR227, 228 and 229).
Sites 41TR70 and 41TR168 are both located on a fluviate terrace of the West Fork
floodplain northeast of Walker Branch. Site 41TR70 consists of a surface base camp that
ranges in age from the Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric times although most of the
artifacts found by local collectors dated to the Late Archaic. The site is remarkable in that
a large amount of manos and metates were present. Site 41TR168 consists of a surficial
lithic scatter with fire-cracked rock and ground stone fragments. Its time frame is
unknown. Both sites were revisited during the ARC 2008 archaeological investigations of
the Arlington Landfill. The surface area mapped for both sites south of the railroad track
had been extensively disturbed and eroded by motocross activities (the area once had a
motocross track). In addition, extensive mining had destroyed eastern third of 41TR70
and few surface artifacts were identified.
Most recently, ARC conducted linear surveys of two other TRA WF interceptors north of
the Trinity River along Walker Branch (Lang, Coleman and Shelton 2009). Despite 12
shovel tests and 3 backhoe trenches, no cultural resources were discovered.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The TRA WF 10 and 13 routes are located in upland areas along intermittent drainages
high up in the Hurricane Creek Watershed that flow into the West Fork of the Trinity
River. Despite this, the area had potential for both prehistoric and historic cultural
resources. Two research questions below were developed to examine the potential of the
study area.
Although, previous investigations show that the majority of sites recorded in the area are
concentrated in the deep alluvial deposits along the West Fork, prehistoric sites are
known to exist in an environmental setting similar to that in which the study project is
located. Studies conducted approximately 4 miles northwest of the study area on the west
side of the DFW Airport along Bear Creek and its tributaries demonstrated that
prehistoric sites could be found high up in the watershed (Shelton, Davis and Skinner
2008). The only differences are that Bear Creek is a perennial creek with a much longer
watershed, while Hurricane Creek is intermittent and less than half the length of the
watershed. Such sites are usually recorded near or around freshwater springs or on knolls
above drainages. The presence of knolls and elevations above the drainages in the study
area indicates that there is potential to find prehistoric sites. Due to the small size of the
water drainages, such sites are more likely to be temporary hunting camps and would
consist of artifact or lithic scatters.
Historic sites exist near the project areas and historic maps show that the area was
inhabited in the late 19th century. These consist of historic structures and trash scatters.
Since the areas has been urbanized greatly since the creation of the maps, historic
structures are likely gone. If sites are found, they are likely to be historic artifact scatters
associated with farming along the drainages.
Methodology
In order to conduct the archaeological survey, the surveyors first reviewed the
information about the study area found in TASA. The 1920 soils map of Tarrant County
published by the USDA Soil Map and Sam Street’s Map of Tarrant County from 1893
were examined for historic structures mapped in the study area. Neither map showed any
structures on the alignments, but some were mapped in the vicinity. The field team
walked two parallel transects spaced 30 meters or less apart and made notes about the
ground exposure, surface artifacts, soil types and disturbed areas where subsoil was
exposed. Photographs were taken along the route using a Fuji FinePix S1000fd 10.0
mega pixel digital camera. Shovel tests were excavated on an average of every 100
meters, in accordance with CTA guidelines (2002). Shovel tests were excavated to the CHorizon. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter and the clay fill was inspected visually
and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural materials were present.
Sandy soils from the shovel tests and auger holes were screened through ¼” hardware
cloth. Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell
Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil colors in each test. The shovel test
locations were determined with a handheld Garmin GPSmap76 receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into two sections with the description of the study area followed
by the survey results. Shovel tests will be described briefly within the text and are
detailed in Appendix A. The conclusions end the chapter.
Survey Area
The route for WF 13 is situated on the west bank of Hurricane Creek south of Tibbets
Drive. Vegetation consists of mesquites, pecans, bois d’arcs, cedars, oaks and greenbriar.
The creek channel itself is approximately 10-12 meters wide and 3-5 meters deep. The
west bank has been stabilized using concrete bags to form a wall and two pipelines
crossing the creek (Figure 3). Additionally, the creek contains asphalt and concrete debris
from the destruction of a road. A similar pile of debris was found on top of the west bank
near the study area.
The route for WF 10 begins north of SH 183 in a wooded area containing weeping
willows, mesquites, pecans and greenbriar surrounding Cyclone Creek. This section of
the route also parallels a fiber optic cable and an existing sewer line and is bisected by a
petroleum pipeline. As the route progresses south of SH 183, it runs on the west side of
Service King Auto Repair (SK). At this point, Cyclone Creek has been bridged to create a
parking lot of for the SK facilities (Figure 4). The route continues in the wooded area on
the west side until reaching the parking lot of the Bandera Ranch Apartments (BRA). The
SK parking lot butts the BRA parking lot; once the SK property ends, the creek is
exposed again and becomes wooded while paralleling the fenceline to the BRA property
in Wilshire Park.

Looking south across SH 183 at Cyclone Creek, the channel has been
bridged for a parking lot for Service King.

The route turns southwest and remains in the wooded area surrounding the creek. The
vegetation in this area consists of greenbriar, pecans, oaks, hackberries, bois d’arcs and
bamboo. The channel is approximately 2-3 meters wide and 50 centimeters to 2 meters
deep. The route then turns south again approximately 65 meters north of Kynette Drive.
The channel of Cyclone Creek has been completely channelized and concreted from this
point south to the end of the route (Figure 5). The center slab of the concrete channel will
be removed during construction and the pipeline will be installed down the center of the
channel.

Survey Results
Two shovel tests were excavated in the study area for WF 13 (Figure 6). The first shovel
test contained 12 centimeters of dark brown sandy loam over mottled brown and
yellowish red sandy clays. Shovel test 2 contained the subsoil on the surface. Ground
visibility ranged from 0 to 75 percent and the surface was eroded. No cultural materials
were recovered in the shovel tests or observed on the surface.

Shovel testing for WF 10 began on the north side of SH 183 (Figure 7). Two shovel tests
(3 and 4) were excavated in areas outside of existing pipeline right-of-ways. Both
contained very dark grayish brown sandy loam over similar mottled subsoil as shovel
tests 1 and 2. The greenbelt along the SK parking lot was eroded and disturbed, therefore
shovel tests 5 and 6 were excavated on the edge. Both contained brown sandy loam over
strong brown clay. Subsoil was typically encountered between 20 and 30 centimeters
below the surface (cmbs). No cultural materials were observed on the surface or in the
shovel tests.

Shovel testing resumed on the south side of the SK parking lot in the greenbelt on the
western edge of Wilshire Park. Four shovel tests (7-10) were excavated along the route
above the creek channel. The A-horizon was deeper along this portion of the route and
shovel test 8 and 9 were the deepest, reaching the subsoil between 75 and 78 cmbs. Some
hematite and quartzite gravels were noted on the surface and in the shovel tests, however
none were larger than a golf ball. No cultural materials were observed in any of the
shovel tests or on the surface.
Conclusions
No prehistoric or historic cultural resources were located during the survey. These results
mirror the results of other linear and small area surveys in the Eastern Cross Timbers and
the upper reaches of the watershed from the West Fork of the Trinity River. Although
Hurricane Creek is mapped as a perennial stream by the USGS, it is more likely an
intermittent stream as shown by the Soil Conservation Service (Ressel 1981:Sheet
Number 26) and the USDA Bureau of Chemistry and Soils (1920) maps. Cyclone Creek
is mapped as an intermittent stream on all three maps. Additionally, there are no springs
reported in their headwaters. No floodplain or natural levee is indicated by the mapped
soils and shovel testing failed to uncover any evidence of prehistoric occupation adjacent
to the creek banks. Additionally, the area has been developed extensively. In summary, it
is reasonable to conclude that no recognizable prehistoric occupation occurred in the area
of the pipeline routes along Hurricane and Cyclone creeks.
The absence of historic residences along the pipeline route may simply be due to the fact
that area has been developed with modern private residences and businesses. No houses
were shown on the earlier maps along the routes. However, residences were mapped near
the pipeline routes and the area was farmed historically. Since the routes are located so
close to the creek banks, it is unlikely that houses would have been situated that close.
Historic trash scatters along the drainages were the only type of site reasonably expected,
yet none were observed. In conclusion, it appears that the survey area was farmed in the
early 1900s but not a place where trash was disposed or residences built.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the absence of cultural materials and the existing modifications and previous
disturbances within the study area, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural
resource investigations are unwarranted. The Trinity River Authority should be allowed
to construct the West Fork Interceptor Segments WF10 and WF13 without further delay.
We further recommend that if cultural resources are uncovered during construction that
work should cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission and the US Army Corps of Engineers Fort Worth Division should be
notified.
