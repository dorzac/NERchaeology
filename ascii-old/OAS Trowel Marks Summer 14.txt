Bryson-Paddock Dig
probes gateway to fort

A break in the outer palisade was just what
he expected – a gateway to the Wichita fort at the
Bryson-Paddock site, archeologist Richard Drass said.
“We did very well. We can conclude there was
an entryway on the southeast edge of the fort, about
4 meters wide,” he said. “Post molds extended east
from the north edge of the fort ditch. They indicated a
stockade protected the entryway.”

The Oklahoma
Anthropological Society may
be asked to assist preservation efforts next spring at the
once-pristine Deer Creek
Wichita trade village site.
“Some sort of dig is
possible. It’s up to the Corps
of Engineers,” said Oklahoma Archeological Survey
staff member Richard Drass.
Although the location of the Deer Creek village of the Wichita has been
identified since 1926, little
has been done at the site.
It has remained under the
protection of the Army Corps
of Engineers.
According to the
Survey’s history of Oklahoma, Wichita Indian towns
such as Bryson-Paddock
and Deer Creek served as
major ports of trade on the
Great Plains. They are identified as protohistoric villages
dating to the early 1700s.
French trappers and
traders made their way up
the Mississippi and Arkansas
rivers, seeking buffalo meat
and hides and in return,
offering pots, pans, metal
knives and the much-prized
beads.

Shooting Arrows
and Slinging Mud:
Custer, the Press, and
the Little Bighorn
By James E. Mueller
OU Press 2013
272 Pages $29.95
ISBN: 9780806143989
Just when I thought
nothing fresh could be added
to the volumes written about
George Armstrong Custer's
overwhelming defeat at
the Little Bighorn, up pops
something new.
It takes an interesting approach to one of the
most studied topics on North
America’s Indian wars. I'm
speaking from years of reading, studying, and writing
about this battle.
Through exceptional
research scanning volumes
of newspaper articles, Mueller gives the reader a clear
view of two crucial years in
America’s move west, 187677. By using the Sioux war
as his canvas, he paints a
mosaic of military, political
and post Civil War reconstruction.
Once again, as
archeology reminds us, context is vital to understanding
things and events.
In using the mass
communication of the time –
newspapers – Mueller writes
with the precise skill of a surgeon. He extracts piece by
piece the very color, mood
and ambience of the period.
In the mid-nineteenth century, the single
most accessible source of
information was newspapers. They were found in
almost every corner of North

America. They were the
pulse of the public. No matter how small, the hamlet,
village or metro city newspapers covered any and all
events of interest.
The papers had
a big canvas in the years
1876-77. The period proved
unique in life-changing
events. Custer's defeat at
Little Bighorn showed the
Indians could fight back and
win big.
Post Civil War reconstruction was raging. The
Hamburg massacre took
place near Augusta, Ga. on
the 4th of July and initiated
nearly a century of Jim Crow
denial of civil rights.
The presidential
campaign between Democrat Rutherford B. Hayes
and Republican Samuel J.
Tilden signaled the end of
Ulysses S. Grant’s administration. The political race
was everything we have
come to expect in a nasty
battle. It was mean, vitriolic,
slanderous and (let's see)
had very little truth. The
candidates squared off in a
do-or-die battle for the White
House.
It was all very real
and like today, intimidating.
In writing about this, I looked
at my calendar and realized
these events all took place
138 years ago. Mueller’s
ability to make it live again is
the mark of a great historian.

"We will continue

need to slow down the financial trend we are on," he
said.

Oklahoma archeology
to get October spotlight

The first annual Oklahoma Archeology Month will put
archeology and history of Oklahoma in the spotlight.
In October archeologists and museums across the
state will host special events for public audiences. Bonnie Pitblado, Professor in Anthropological Archeology at the University of Oklahoma, is helping coordinate activities.
The Oklahoma Anthropological Society, Oklahoma
Archeological Survey, Oklahoma State Historic Preservation
Office, and OU Anthropology Department will co-sponsor
state-wide activities.
Leading the OAS effort is President Debra Baker.
She is working to promote visitor sites and sights that are not
always in the spotlight.
The goal is to increase awareness of the diverse archeological and cultural preservation projects that blanket the
state, said Dr. Pitblado, a member of the OAS Board.
For years many states have held archeology months
with great success.
“It is hoped October 2014 marks the first of many
annual Oklahoma Archeology months to come,” Dr. Pitblado
said.
Oklahoma events already scheduled include tours of
archaeological sites and historic buildings, demonstrations of
prehistoric flint knapping, pottery and chain-mail production,
and lectures.
Geographically, the month's hosts range from the
Quapaw Nation in northeast Oklahoma to Lawton's Museum
of the Great Plains in the southwest.
“If you, your OAS chapter, or your institution would
like to add your own presentation to the emerging list of hosts,
or if you would like to collaborate with an existing host, please
contact Stephanie Stutts," Dr. Pitblado said

2013 OAS Bulletin offers topics
ranging from hot rock cooking
to archaic spear point styles
Contributors provide
four articles of interest in the
latest Bulletin of the Oklahoma Anthropological Society.
Bulletin Editor Bob
Brooks, Norman, presents
topics ranging from protohistoric Caddo and Wichitas
sharing a village to early
archaic spear point styles,
hot rock cooking, and Lake
Hudson tools.
Tim Baugh, archeology professor at the University of Oklahoma, Norman,
proposes a new view on the
protohistoric occupants of
the Lowrance site in Murray County. An OAS dig in
spring and fall 1969, the site
has evidence the Caddo and
Wichitas may have lived side
by side in the village.
Don Dickson, a
prominent authority on Na-

tive American archeology
and prehistory of the Ozarks
region, gives a glimpse of
Time Capsule Cave, a site
in Madison County, Ark. east
of Fayetteville. Noteworthy is
the large number of transitional Paleoindian and early
archaic spear point styles
recovered from the cave.
A third article is
by Tim Perttula, a Fellow
of the Texas Archeological Society and archeologist with Archaeological &
Environmental Consultants,
Austin, Texas. He examines
the use of hot rock cooking by prehistoric people at

his continuing analysis of
materials from Lake Hudson
