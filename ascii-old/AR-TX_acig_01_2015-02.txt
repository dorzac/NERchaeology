Abstract
In September of 2014, prior to construction of a 3,400-foot-long proposed wastewater line
with a 50-foot-wide construction easement in Williamson County, Texas, archeologists
from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey and shovel testing in accordance with
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical Commission (THC)
guidelines. The City of Cedar Park proposed construction of this wastewater line in order
to provide sewer service to the commercial node located at the intersection of RM 1431
and US 183A. The survey covered a total of 3.9 acres and was conducted in compliance
with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Permit #7019. Robin Benson
Barnes served as Principal Investigator. Records from this investigation will be curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
No prehistoric or historic artifacts or features were observed and no sites were recorded.
Significant portions of the proposed alignment had been disturbed by the construction of
water control features and by residential development. Based on the results of this cultural
resources survey, no further archeological work is recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The City of Cedar Park is proposing to construct a wastewater line in order to provide
sewer service to the commercial node located at the intersection of RM 1431 and US
183A. The proposed alignment traverses generally from west to east just north of Spanish
Oak Creek and approximately 1,640 feet (500 meters) south of RM 1431. The alignment
runs between the terminus of C-bar Ranch Trail on the west, crosses Skyview
approximately 2,130 feet (650 meters) to the east, and ends approximately 1,215 feet
(370 meters) further to the east, approximately as far east as Arrow Point Drive.
The proposed wastewater line would be a 15-inch gravity wastewater line installed
through an open trench. This cultural resources survey evaluated a 3,400-foot- (1,036­
meter-) long by 50-foot- (15-meter-) wide pipeline easement (20-foot/6-meter permanent
easement, with 30-foot/9-meter temporary construction easement), which is the defined
Area of Potential Effect (APE) (Figures 1 and 2). The alignment for Phase 1 of the
Spanish Oak Creek Wastewater Line project extends 4,000 feet (1,220 meters) to the east
and north of the current alignment, generally paralleling Spanish Oak Creek and ending
just north of RM 1431 (Barnes and Scott 2012). The Phase 1 alignment has been
completed and is in service.
This investigation consisted of an intensive archeological survey of the proposed Spanish
Oak Creek Phase 2 wastewater line pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC
26.20[2]). The overall investigation included pedestrian survey, photography, subsurface
testing, basic archival research, data analysis, and report preparation in accordance with
THC and CTA standards. Site recording and National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) eligibility assessments were not required.

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 Environmental Setting
The project area is located in central Texas in the south end of the Lampasas Cut Plain.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is characterized by rolling hills bisected by the Brazos River and
its tributaries to form broad, shallow valleys. In this region, the hills provide
approximately 30 meters of relief along the creeks. Karst features including sinks, caves,
and rock shelters are present but not common (Collins and Mear 1998). Hydrologically,
Spanish Oak Creek flows into Brushy Creek just to the south of the project area. Brushy
Creek flows east/northeast eventually reaching the Brazos River.
The Blackland Prairie lies just to the east of the project area on the eastern side of the
Balcones Escarpment, a fault zone with hills to the west and north and low relief to the
east and south. The Blackland Prairie supports prairie vegetation along with small woods
often found along low gradient streams. The Edwards Plateau is located just to the south
of the project area. This region differs from the Lampasas Cut Plain in that the stream cut
valleys are more deeply incised. Springs, karstic sinks, caves, and rock shelters are
characteristic of the region (Collins and Mear 1998).
Prehistoric and historic peoples living in the region would have had access to resources of
the Blackland Prairie and Edwards Plateau in addition to Lampasas Cut Plain resources.
The diversity of biotic resources found in this ecotonal region would have been very
high. In addition, there is access to reliable water sources as well as chert for making
stone tools (Collins and Mear 1998).
2.2 Soils and Geology
Soils in this area are classified as Denton-Eckrant-Doss Association, an association
composed of moderately deep, shallow, and very shallow, calcareous, clayey, cobbly, and
stony soils formed from indurated fractured limestone or limy earth (SCS 1983). Four
soil units occur in the proposed alignment (Figure 3):
Denton silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (DnB) – This soil is found in narrow
drainageways as well as in shallow valleys. The surface layer is dark brown silt clay
roughly 33 inches thick. The following layer is very pale brown silty clay loam that
extends to a depth of approximately 36 inches with underlying fractured limestone. The
available water capacity is medium, and the permeability is slow due to the shallow depth
of the limestone. This soil is well drained.
Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes (EaD) – This soil is generally found in
irregular shapes on undulating uplands. The surface consists of around 13 inches of a
dark grayish brown cobbly layer. The underlying material consists of coarsely fractured
4

indurated limestone. The soil is moderately permeable as long as it does not dry to the
point of cracking. It is well drained, and the available water capacity is very low.
Fairlie clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes (FaB) – This sloping soil is found along broad flats as
well as drainageways. Most areas are long and narrow, ranging from 15 to 100 acres or
more in size. The surface layer is dark grayish-brown clay about 21 inches thick. The
following layer, to 46 inches, is gray clay in the upper layer and dark grayish brown in
the lower layer. The soil is moderately permeable as long as it does not dry out to the
point of cracking. It is well drained, and the available water capacity is very low.
Georgetown clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes (GeB) – This gently sloping soil is generally
found on uplands. The slightly acidic surface layer is brown clay loam approximately
seven inches thick. The reddish-brown upper subsoil extends to 35 inches and has cobbly
clay in the lower portion. This soil is well drained with a low water capacity and slow
permeability.
The proposed alignment lies within the Comanche Peak Formation (Kc). The Comanche
Peak Formation is exposed in the drainage basins and is composed of fine-grained,
fossiliferous, medium hard, nodular limestone (Collins and Mear 1998:11).

3.0 REGIONAL HISTORY AND CULTURE CHRONOLOGY
3.1 Prehistoric Background
The property falls within the Central Texas archeological region (Collins 1995).
Prehistoric archeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous human occupation
starting around 11,500 years ago. Michael B. Collins (1995) authored a synthesis of
Central Texas archeology in which he divides the prehistory of Central Texas into three
periods: (1) the Paleoindian, (2) the Archaic, and (3) the Late Prehistoric. Each of these is
further divided into subperiods, such as early and late. Dates are presented as Before
Present or BP in Table 1.

The Paleoindian period dates between approximately 11,500 and 8,800 BP (Collins
1995:381-3). The Early Paleoindian in Central Texas is part of a larger, regional cultural
horizon, the Clovis horizon. Clovis sites record a general hunter-gatherer lifeway based
upon a wide variety of fauna including large herbivores as well as smaller animals.
Evidence of plant resources is less common, but it is presumed that local flora were also
important to subsistence. In contrast, later Folsom sites indicate a greater reliance upon
big game hunting. The Late Paleoindian seems transitional between the Paleoindian and
Archaic in that burned rock features are present, but they are not as large or ubiquitous as
those associated with the Archaic. Other artifacts, features, and faunal remains seem
more similar to those found later in the Archaic.
Archaic (Collins 1995:383-385) sites in Central Texas are most often associated with the
use of heated rock in hearths, ovens, middens, and scatters. The period as a whole is
defined by the intensified use of local resources and diversity of material culture in
comparison to the Paleoindian period. The climate ranged from mesic (relatively moist)
in the Early Archaic and the later part of the Late Archaic to xeric (relatively dry) during
the Middle Archaic and beginning of the Late Archaic. Subsistence during mesic times
was centered on the live-oak savanna, while a shift in emphasis toward xerophytes may
have occurred during xeric intervals.

7

The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups, primarily from
the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics into the archeological
record takes place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans
inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
3.2 Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth century when Spanish explorers traveled through the
region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas. Captain Alonso De León
followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop several times during the 1680s,
and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and
Captain Domingo Ramon, a Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and
camped on the banks of Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them
Arroyo do las Bendítas Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, the
Marques de Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through
present-day Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions. In the mid
eighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established along the San Gabriel
River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753, drought and disease
made the missions uninhabitable and Spanish influence in the area declined (Odintz
2002).
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. In 1835,
continual attacks by local Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and his company
of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the headwaters of Brushy
Creek in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson Fort, as it was called, was
abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several veterans
of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838, Dr. Thomas Kenney and his family
built a fort on Brushy Creek in what is now eastern Williamson County. Kenney’s Fort
became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County. By the 1840s, several
settlements existed along Brushy Creek. However, Indian attacks were a frequent
problem, and numerous settlers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians. By 1846, the
Indian threat had waned and settlement in the region increased. In 1848, the Texas
legislature established Williamson County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a Milam
County Judge and state senator.
By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the San
Gabriel (Odintz 2002), but a few families were living in the western half. During the
8

1850’s and 1860’s, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up around the county.
Although urbanization and industrialization increased somewhat, the bulk of the county
remained rural and agricultural. The majority of the families lived on subsistence farms in
log houses and raised corn. During the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave population
increased and the agricultural patterns within the county became more diverse. Wheat
and corn were the predominant crops in the Blackland prairies, and cattle and sheep
ranching was widespread throughout the county. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but
it was not a significant cash crop.
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War but picked up again in
the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the expansion of cotton
farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisholm trail, which was established
in 1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle drives passed through or originated
in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s were also marked by the arrival of railroads
to Williamson County (Odintz 2002).
By the early-twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry in
importance. With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm tenancy
developed. As late as 1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by owners.
However, by 1890 43 percent of farms were worked by owners, and by 1930 only 29
percent of farms were worked by owners. The tenancy rates continued to drop during the
Great Depression (Odintz 2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of soil
depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil infestation.
The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation and encouraged
farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton production was reduced by nearly
half, while sorghum and wheat became important crops. Along with cattle and sheep,
poultry farming intensified (Odintz 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped areas of
Williamson County meant urban populations now had easier access to the Hill Country
and vice versa. The consolidation of rural schools also meant children could now attend
schools outside of their rural communities. For example, during the 1910s and 1920s,
Rock House School was one of the largest schools in Williamson County. In 1903, the
school boasted a population of 96 students and 2 teachers. The school was consolidated
with Liberty Hill School in 1947, and by the 1990s Rock House had become a dispersed
agricultural community.
Suburbanization of the portions of the county bordering Austin caused the population of
Williamson County to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the population of
Williamson County was 37,305. By 1982, the population had grown to over 85,700
9

(Odintz 2002). A pattern of absentee ownership and of non-agricultural use of the land
intensified following World War II. Austin, Georgetown, and Liberty Hill grew rapidly.
4.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
A literature review of the THC Archeological and Historic Sites databases, historic maps,
and records from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) revealed that no
sites have been recorded within the limits of the proposed alignment and six sites have
been recorded within one kilometer of the proposed project. All six sites are prehistoric,
with one site having an historic component as well. Site information is summarized in

Site 41WM233 was recorded in the ROW by TxDOT in 1973 but was not presented in a
report detailing the recommendations or any assessments. While it has not been subject to
a recent survey, records on file at TARL indicate that site 41WM233 was subject to
testing shortly after its recording in 1973. No intact buried cultural deposits were
identified from that testing. Site records and maps indicate that most, if not all, of the site
was destroyed by the construction of RM 1431 and the nearby bridge. Site 41WM233 can
be considered not eligible for NRHP or SAL inclusion due to the evidence in the TARL
records indicating a lack of intact deposits and the likely destruction of the site from the
construction of the roadway.
The Lansford Site (41WM145), a burned rock midden, was excavated by Southwestern
University between 1968 and 1970 under the direction of Professor Steelman. A site form
on file at TARL and records from the collections at Southwestern University (Stellman
n.d.) include a site sketch map indicating that ten of the twenty-five planned trenches
were excavated. Approximately 5 feet of dark earth underlain by dark brown and then
light brown was excavated, and points, scrapers, gravers, burins, burin spalls, knives,
rubbing stones, bone, snails, charcoal, and a few fossils were collected. A radiocarbon
sample from the site was dated to 2235 +/- radiocarbon years before present (300 B.C.),
indicating Late Archaic occupation.
Since the excavations, a house and outbuildings have been constructed within the site
boundaries and much of the remainder of the site is under cultivation. A small portion of
the site was determined not to contribute to eligibility for NRHP or SAL designation
during the Spanish Oak Creek Wastewater Line (Phase 1) archeological survey (Barnes
and Scott 2012).
Site 41WM701, also a burned rock midden, was recorded and partially excavated by
archeologists at the University of Texas at Austin who excavated a burial by request of a
private landowner. NRHP or SAL eligibility status is unknown for 41WM701. Site
41WM736 was recorded by a Texas Archeological Society Steward in 1987 prior to
development of the property. No evidence of the site was found twenty years later
(Campbell and Lassen 2007). Site 41WM653 is a lithic scatter/lithic procurement site
recorded in 1984 (Coffman et al. 1985). The site lacks any intact deposits and was
considered not eligible for NRHP or SAL inclusion. Site 41WM945, a prehistoric and
historic artifact scatter, was investigated during a cultural resources project prior to the
construction of the Cottonwood Creek wastewater pipeline and found to be not eligible
for NRHP or SAL inclusion (Feit and Karbula 1999).
Cultural resource projects conducted within one kilometer of the proposed project area
include the aforementioned Spanish Oak Creek Wastewater Line (Barnes and Scott
2012), Cottonwood Creek wastewater pipeline (Feit and Karbula 1999), the Ideal Basic
Tract (Coffman et al. 1985), the TxDOT pedestrian surveys conducted prior to the
construction of RM 1431 and US 183A, and a 1994 EPA survey. Additional cultural
11

resources surveys were conducted by PBS&J in 2001 on a Leander Independent School
District (ISD) tract and along the Parmer Lane Extension (Hickman 1993). An
elementary school and stadium have been constructed on the Leander ISD property. The
reports from projects conducted within one kilometer of the proposed alignment and cited
in Table 2 are listed in the References Cited section.

5.0 METHODOLOGY
Following a review of current archeological sites data and historical research, a 100%
pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate any archeological or historical sites
that may be adversely affected by construction of the wastewater line.
Survey methods complied with THC/CTA survey standards for the overall project area.
A pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate any archeological or historical
sites that may be adversely affected by construction. The subject area was walked in
parallel transects spaced sufficiently to adequately cover the APE (less than 30 meters).
Recording methods included a daily log, photography, the use of task specific forms for
recording shovel tests and photographs, and the use of a handheld GPS.
Sub-surface testing was limited to shovel testing due to the shallow depth of deposits.
Shovel tests were excavated in settings with potential for buried cultural horizons or less
than 30 percent ground surface visibility. The shovel tests were at least 30 centimeters
(cm) in diameter and were excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits. The shovel test
levels were no thicker than 20 cm, and the excavated sediments were screened through
¼-inch hardware cloth.
No sites were discovered, negating the need for recording sites or making determinations
for eligibility as a SAL or listing on the NRHP.

14

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
No artifacts or features indicating the presence of prehistoric or historic sites were
observed during the pedestrian survey. Shovel testing was limited due to the level of
disturbance in portions of the APE (Figure 5) as well as good visibility and shallow
deposits in other portions of the APE. Confirmation of the depth of deposits in some
areas was provided by exposed profiles in the cut banks of Spanish Oak Creek.
The western 300 meters (1,000 feet) of the proposed alignment has been disturbed by the
placement of a concrete pad and construction of water control features to the south. In
addition, development of one lot to the north of the alignment that includes paved parking
extends to the southern edge of the lot immediately adjacent to the northern extent of the
APE (Figure 6). Much of this section of the APE is a berm left from the construction of
the water control features. Due to the level of disturbance, no shovel tests were
excavated. No artifacts were observed in the disturbed fill.
The remainder of the APE is located near the property lines of residential lots located just
to the north of Spanish Oak Creek. Except for the eastern end of the alignment, the lots
had good surface visibility in either sparsely vegetated lawns or within the tree line
paralleling Spanish Oak Creek. Deposits were shallow and the surface appeared to be
deflated with exposed older sediments and gravels. The APE within the residential lots
had been disturbed by fence posts, concrete pads for outbuildings, and landscaping which
included the planting of fruit trees (Figure 7). The cut banks of Spanish Oak Creek
verified the shallow depth of deposits indicated by the surface exposures (Figure 8).
The eastern end of the APE has the deepest deposits and has not been disturbed by
residential landscaping or outbuildings (Figure 9). One shovel test was dug within the
tree line (Table 3). The upper sediments were a clay loam underlain by older clays.
Excavation was impeded by roots. No artifacts or cultural features were observed. The
cut banks of Spanish Oak Creek did show the deeper deposits at the eastern end of the
alignment. However, it appeared that recent sediments lay atop older deposits with much
of the Holocene record missing.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In advance of the construction of a proposed wastewater line in Williamson County,
Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey and shovel testing
in accordance with CTA and THC guidelines along a 3,400-foot- (1,036-meter-) long by
50-foot- (15-meter-) wide pipeline easement. This work was conducted in compliance
with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Permit #7019. No prehistoric
or historic artifacts or features were observed and no sites were recorded. Significant
portions of the APE had been previously disturbed by the construction of water control
features and by residential development. Based on the results of this cultural resources
survey, no further archeological work is recommended. It must be noted that no level of
survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural features within a project area.
Therefore, should previously unrecorded cultural resources including human remains be
discovered during the course of construction for this project, the City of Cedar Park or
Garrett Ihnen Engineering, Inc. will contact the Texas Historical Commission of the
inadvertent discoveries.
