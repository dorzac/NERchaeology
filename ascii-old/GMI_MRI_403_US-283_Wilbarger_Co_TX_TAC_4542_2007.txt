MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted an intensive pedestrian survey for archeological resources for
Michael Baker, Jr., Inc., on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation, of the proposed
2.2-mile-long linear project along U.S. 283 between FM 925 and U.S. 287 north of Vernon in
Wilbarger County. Survey for the proposed road-widening project totaled roughly 22.7 acres of
existing state-owned right-of-way and original plans included shovel testing and archeological
trenching within proximity to the locations of the newly proposed Pease River bridge and two
proposed relief structures. Conditions on the ground, however, prevented archeological trenching
in the two relief areas. Construction plan schematics created by Texas Department of
Transportation and provided to Geo-Marine by the client determined the area of potential effect to
be entirely within the preexisting state-owned right-of-way and includes the expected depth of
impacts of 5 feet except in the flood plain where the depth of impact will be much deeper,
probably to bedrock.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this construction project area was to
determine the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for
eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, as per Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Geo-Marine, Inc., archeologists conducted fieldwork on August 13–14, 2007 (GMI project #
30575.00.02). Twenty-five shovel tests and seven archeological trenches were excavated,
resulting in the documentation of one recent scatter of re-deposited materials or locality. This
locality is not worthy of designation as an official trinomial archeological site nor is it eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. As no archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16.1) or State Archeological
Landmarks (13 TAC 26.12) occur within the APE, no such properties would be affected by the
undertaking. Therefore, it is recommended that no additional investigations are warranted and
construction may proceed. Though no artifacts were collected, all notes, forms, and photographs
obtained from the project are on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the
University of Texas at Austin curation repository.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report describes the results of an intensive archeological pedestrian survey along
approximately 2.2 miles of the U.S. 283 proposed road improvement project north of Vernon,
Texas, in Wilbarger County between U.S. 287 and FM 925. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), under
subcontract with Michael Baker, Jr., Inc., conducted survey of this road widening project in the
Wichita Falls District of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The archeological
survey for this project was undertaken on August 13–14, 2007, in order to satisfy federal
requirements governing cultural resources treatment of historic properties under Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. §
470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915] and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of
1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347; P.L. 91–190; 83 Stat. 852]. TxDOT, the ultimate client, created
under enabling state legislation and thus a political entity of the State of Texas, must comply with
the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources Code of Texas];
therefore, the archeological resources investigation was carried out under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4542.
The purpose of the pedestrian survey was to identify and inventory all archeological resources
contained within the proposed project area and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL). The area of potential effect (APE) for this project is defined as the entirety of
the existing state-owned right-of-way (ROW; 22.7 acres) along 2.2 miles of U.S. 283 between
Vernon and FM 925 (Figure 1). The depth of impacts are not expected to reach beyond a
maximum depth of 5 ft throughout most of the ROW except in the flood plain where the depth of
impact will go deep, possibly to bedrock (see Figure 1). Survey for the proposed road-widening
project totaled roughly 22.7 acres of existing state-owned right-of-way, and original plans
included shovel testing and archeological trenching within proximity to the locations of the newly
proposed Pease River bridge and two proposed relief structures. Conditions on the ground,
however, prevented archeological trenching in the two relief areas. Construction plan schematics
created by Texas Department of Transportation and provided to Geo-Marine by the client
determined the area of potential effect to be entirely within the preexisting right-of-way.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area is located in the flood plain of the Pease River and its adjacent northern uplands
to the north of Vernon in Wilbarger County, Texas. This general area is referred to as the
“Panhandle Plains” eco-region of Texas and is part of the Kansan biotic province. In more
specific terms, the project area lies within the Lower Plains portion of the Southern Great Plains
or the Central Rolling Red Plains. This chapter summarizes the modern natural environmental
conditions of the survey area by providing information about the topography and hydrology,
geology, soils, climate, and flora and fauna, and concludes with a synthesis of the regional
paleoenvironmental sequence.

TOPOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
The project area begins at the intersection of U.S. 283 and U.S. 287 and continues northward to
conclude at the intersection of U.S. 283 and FM 925. The project area crosses the flood plain of
the Pease River and includes the associated terraces to the north and then uplands. Elevation
within this project area ranges from 1,100 to 1,300 feet (ft) above mean sea level (see Figure 1).
The Pease River eventually drains into the Red River to the east of Vernon.

GEOLOGY
Wilbarger County lies within the Central Rolling Red Plains (Hofman et al. 1989), which stretch
from the Edwards Plateau just south of the vicinity of Abilene, Texas, northward to the Red
River. Upon crossing the Red River, this same physiographic province in Oklahoma is referred
to as the Redbed (or Red Bed) Plains (Albert and Wyckoff 1984; Morris et al. 1976). These two
areas constitute two parts of a larger physiographic region, which has been called the Low or
Rolling Plains (Hofman et al. 1989) or the Osage Plains (Lobeck 1948; Weissenborn 1948), that
has its northernmost border in Kansas (Etchieson et al. 1979).
The Central Rolling Red Plains area in general consists of smooth plains dissected by numerous
streams and creeks. The overall area is characterized by relatively low relief, ranging up to about
183 meters (m; 600 ft) above mean sea level, “from the broad shale valleys to the east, across a
4

rugged gypsum escarpment, to the rolling sandy uplands to the west” (Etchieson et al. 1979:16).
The soils in this area formed in outwash sediments and on Permian sandstone, clay, shale, and
dolomite; the streams and creeks have narrow bands of alluvial soil deposited by water action.
The project area is underlain by three separate formations: Quaternary alluvium composed of
silts, sands and clays; Permian-age Clear Fork Group, undivided; and windblown Quaternary
deposits. The flood plain of the Pease River is noted as being composed of the Quaternary
alluvium, and this geological formation occupies roughly one-third of the APE. These deposits
potentially may contain buried soils. This alluvium is described as “floodplain and channel
deposits; sand, silt, clay and gravel; include lowest terrace deposits near floodplain level and local
bedrock in stream channels. Thickness of alluvium can be upwards of 30 feet” (Bureau of
Economic Geology [BEG] 1987). The terrace portion of the APE north of the Pease River is
mapped as the Permian-age Clear Fork Group, undivided. The remaining portion of the APE is
mapped as Permian-age Clear Fork Group, undivided and described as “being dominated by
sandstone, shale, limestone, clay, and gypsum. The limestones are quite earthy and are often full
of fossil casts. Shales are often impregnated with salt, and none are free of gypsum. Sandstones
are red, gray, and spotted and generally very friable. Gypsum beds are numerous and often very
thick, and the seams of fibrous gypsum traverse and transect the clays and shales in every
direction, ranging from paper-like seams to 10 inches in thickness, often making a network of
seams. Toward the western boundary of these beds, strata are much distorted and folded,
indicating a probable heavy lateral pressure from the west that crumpled the strata into short
folds; in the gypsum, the folds are often only an inch or two across (BEG 1987; USGS 2007).
There is little to indicate buried soils would be present in this formation, and it is likely this
geological section has been impacted either through the processes of erosion or the mining of
gypsum. The windblown Quaternary deposits are described as including “dunes and dune ridges
. . . and sheet deposits . . . sheets deposits include silt, sand and clay, orange-brown, massive
with crude vertical joints, subdued dune topography” (BEG 1987). This area is used as crop
lands, but given the presence of dunes, it is possible that undisturbed surfaces exist beneath the
plow zone.
SOILS
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA 2007) has 11 mapped soils within the project area:
Rotan clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slope; Enterprise very fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes,
Enterprise very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Lincoln loamy fine sand; Rough broken
land, clayey; Rough broken land, loamy; Riverwash; Lincoln loamy fine sand, 0 to 1 percent
slopes; Texroy silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes; Tivoli fine sand; and Yomont very fine sandy
loam.
Rotan clay loam
The Rotan component has a slope of 0 to 1 percent and is found on plains on alluvial plain
remnants. The parent material consists of mixed clayey alluvium. Depth to a root-restrictive
layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained. Water movement in
the most restrictive layer is moderately high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches is high.
Shrink-swell potential is high. This soil is not flooded or ponded. There is no zone of water
saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2
percent. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 6 percent
(USDA 2007).
5

This soil is located at the northernmost edge of the project area and has a low potential for
containing intact deposits or cultural materials due to highway construction and agricultural
impact.
Enterprise very fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes
This soil has a 0 to 1 percent slope and is found on terraces of river valleys on plains. The parent
material consists of mixed loamy eolian sands. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60
inches. The natural drainage class is well drained. Water movement in the most restrictive layer
is high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches is high. Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil
is not flooded or ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches.
Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 1 percent. The calcium carbonate
equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 23 percent (USDA 2007).
This soil is located near the southern section of the APE just to the south of the southernmost
relief replacement. The soil has a low potential for containing cultural materials due to the fact
the soil has been impacted by development, agricultural practices, road construction, and use as a
waste site.
Enterprise very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes
This soil has a 1 to 3 percent slope and is typically a component on terraces of river valleys on
plains. The parent material consists of mixed loamy eolian sands. Depth to a root restrictive
layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained. Water movement in
the most restrictive layer is high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches is high. Shrink-swell
potential is low. This soil is not flooded, nor is it ponded. There is no zone of water saturation
within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 1 percent.
The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 23 percent (USDA
2007).
The soil is located in two locations. The larger exposure of soil is located near the southern end
of the project area between the intersection of U.S. 283/U.S. 287 and the aforementioned soil.
This area has been impacted by development and road construction. The other section of this soil
is situated only on the east side of U.S. 283 directly south of FM 2072 and has been impacted by
road construction and development. Therefore, both of these areas have low potentials to contain
any intact deposits or cultural resources.
Lincoln loamy fine sand
This soil has a slope of 0 to 2 percent and is typically a component on flood plains on river
valleys on plains. The parent material consists of mixed sandy alluvium. Depth to a root
restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat excessively
drained. Water movement in the most restrictive layer is high. Available water to a depth of 60
inches is low. Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is occasionally flooded. It is not ponded.
A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 78 inches during January, February, March, April, May,
November, and December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 0 percent. The
calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 3 percent (USDA
2007).
6

This soil is located near the southern edge of the proposed replacement of the Pease River bridge.
The nature of the Pease River flood plain, the constricting actions of flood waters by the current
Pease River bridge and embankment, and the use of the area as pasture have all impacted this
location.
Rough broken land, clayey; and Rough broken land, loamy
Generated brief soil descriptions are created for major soil components. The Rough broken land
is a miscellaneous area (USDA 2007).
The areas designated as these soils have been impacted by various activities such as mining or
dumping. These soils are between the northern bank of the Pease River and the southern edge of
FM 2072, except for the small sliver of the Enterprise very fine sandy loam (1 to 3 percent slope)
previously mentioned. This area can be summarized as the slope of the uplands extending
southward from FM 2072 to the Pease River, and the entire area has been adversely impacted.
Riverwash
Generated brief soil descriptions are created for major soil components. This soil type is a
miscellaneous area composed of modern alluvial fill (USDA 2007).
The area designated as this soil type is the same as defined for Rough broken land, clayey; and
Rough broken land, loamy areas, but there is a potential for buried soils to be present in such
environments.
Lincoln loamy fine sand, 0 to 1 percent slopes
This soil has a slope of 0 to 1 percent and is typically a component on flood plains on river
valleys on plains. The parent material consists of mixed sandy alluvium. Depth to a rootrestrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat excessively
drained. Water movement in the most restrictive layer is high. Available water to a depth of 60
inches is low. Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is frequently flooded. It is not ponded. A
seasonal zone of water saturation is at 78 inches during January, February, March, April, May,
November, and December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 0 percent. The
calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 3 percent.
This soil is located along the portion of the Pease River proposed bridge replacement between the
Lincoln loamy fine sand and the Riverwash soil units. The nature of the Pease River flood plain,
the constricting actions of flood waters by the current Pease River bridge and embankment, and
the use of the area as pasture have all impacted this location.
Texroy silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes
This soil has a slope of 0 to 1 percent and is typically found on plains. The parent material
consists of mixed alluvium. Depth to a root-restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The
natural drainage class is well drained. Water movement in the most restrictive layer is
7

moderately high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches is high. Shrink-swell potential is low.
This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of
72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent. The calcium
carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 5 percent (USDA 2007).
This soil unit comprises the majority of the uplands segment of the APE between FM 925 and
FM 2072. This soil has a low potential for containing intact deposits or cultural materials due to
highway construction and agricultural impacts.

Tivoli fine sand
This soil has a slope of 5 to 20 percent and is located on sand sheets on plains. The parent
material consists of sandy alluvium and/or eolian deposits. Depth to a root-restrictive layer is
greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is excessively drained. Water movement in the
most restrictive layer is high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches is very low. Shrink-swell
potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation
within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 1 percent
(USDA 2007).
This soil is located near the southernmost proposed relief replacement. The area is prone to
flooding by the Pease River and given the degree of the slope, it is likely this landform has been
heavily eroded and impacted by road construction and agricultural practices.

Yomont very fine sandy loam
This soil has a slope between 0 and 1 percent. It is a component on flood plains and in river
valleys on plains. The parent material consists of mixed loamy alluvium. Depth to a rootrestrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained. Water
movement in the most restrictive layer is high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches is high.
Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is occasionally flooded. It is not ponded. There is no
zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface
horizon is about 1 percent. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does
not exceed 6 percent (USDA 2007).
This soil surrounds the proposed location for the replacement of the middle relief structure along
U.S. 283. The area is dominated by a depression and is filled with standing water, which is likely
the result of impacts from road construction and the building up of the current road bed.

CLIMATE
The general project area lies within an area of warm-temperate climate and is characterized by
dry winters and hot, humid summers. The project area lies roughly on the boundary between the
humid climate of East Texas and the semiarid climate to the west. The normal annual rainfall in
the area averages about 61 centimeters (cm; 24 inches [in]), with an evaporation rate about
102 cm (40 in). Due to the high evaporation rate, all sources of potable water are precious and
important to both animals and humans (Etchieson et al. 1979:27; Rogers and Risinger 1979:1).
8

The yearly distribution of this rainfall is typical of the Great Plains, with the greatest amount
falling during the periods from April to June and from September to October; specifically, 70
percent of the precipitation falls between May and October. Thunderstorms occur on an average
of about 35 to 45 days per year, but severe storms and tornadoes are generally infrequent (Rogers
and Risinger 1979).
A great range in temperature characterizes the APE, as it does the Great Plains as a whole.
Although the mean annual temperature for the area is 16oC (62oF), the overall range varies from a
winter low of -22oC (-8oF) to a summer high of 45oC (114oF). Periods of very cold weather are
short, however, and even in January, fair and mild conditions frequently prevail. Long periods of
high daytime temperatures are broken by thunderstorms on an average of about five times a
month in the summer. Evening summer temperatures may fall as much as 10–20oC in an hour
when cold, dry polar air masses move down from the north and replace the warmer, tropical air
from the Gulf of Mexico (Rogers and Risinger 1979).
FLORA AND FAUNA
The Lower Plains region of northern Texas, including Wilbarger County, is generally an area of
transition between the forest fauna of the east and the grassland fauna of the west, although the
latter predominates. The area has been placed by Blair (1950) within what has been called the
Kansan biotic province, although he does note that the mixture of faunal species makes it difficult
to classify (Blair 1950:109–110).
In Blair’s (1950:111) description, “The most extensive plant communities are the mesquite-grass
associations, characterized by open stands of mesquite and a few other shrubs alternating with a
good cover of grasses.” Principal grass cover includes various species of grama and three-awn.
Broomweed and gaillardia are also abundant, along with various forbs. Numerous species of
trees, including oaks, elms, hackberries, and maples, extend over stream flood plains and exist in
steep-walled canyons in the western part of this district (Blair 1950:111). Plants commonly
associated with this vegetation type include lotebush, shin oak, sumac, Texas prickly pear,
tasajillo, kidneywood, agarito, redbud, yucca, Lindheimer silktassel, sotol, catclaw, Mexican
persimmon, sideoats grama, three-awn, Texas grama, curly mesquite, buffalograss, and hairy
tridens (McMahan et al. 1984:10). Minor amounts of the cottonwood-hackberry-saltcedar
brush/woods vegetation type are found along the southern edge of the project area. Typical plants
within this area include Lidheimer’s black willow, buttonbush, groundsel-tree, rough-leaf
dogwood, Panhandle grape, heartleaf ampelopsis, false climbing buckwheat, cattail, switchgrass,
prairie cordgrass, salt grass, alkali sacaton, spikesedge, horsetail, bulrush, coarse sumpweed, and
Maximilian sunflower (McMahan et al. 1984:10). Many of the plant resources of the area are
known to be presently utilized as food or for other purposes, while many other plants are known
to have various potential uses (see Etchieson et al. [1979:Table 1] for a presentation of
economically useful plants in the region).
Characteristic mammals of the Kansan province include black-footed ferret, spotted skunk,
striped skunk, badger, coyote, black-tailed prairie dog, hispid pocket mouse, silky pocket mouse,
white-footed mouse, southern plains woodrat, black-tailed jack rabbit, and, at one time, bison.
Eastern forest species that reach the western limits of their ranges in this province include eastern
mole, fox squirrel, and eastern cottontail (Blair 1950:111). Other important mammals reported to
have inhabited the area, now or in the past, include porcupine, raccoon, ringtail, red fox, cougar,
collared peccary, mule deer, and white-tailed deer (Schmidly 1983, 1984; Thurmond et al.
1981:22–23).
9

The only land turtle known in the Kansan province is the western box turtle, but several species
of water turtle do occur in the area, including snapping turtle, mud turtle, cooter turtle, and
softshell turtle. Fourteen species of lizards are known in the area, although none of them are
restricted to it. These include the Texas horned lizard, spiny lizard, collared lizard, and greater
five-lined skink. Thirty-one species of snakes are known for the Kansan province, including
western whiptail, water snake, corn snake, gopher snake, garter snake, king snake, black racer,
western diamondback rattlesnake, and water moccasin (Blair 1950:112; Thurmond et al.
1981:21–22). Other important animal resources include fish, amphibians, and a variety birds,
among which are several species of prairie chicken and quail, mourning dove, and turkey
(Thurmond et al. 1981:21–22). The area is on a major flyway, making a large number of
migratory bird species available as well (Etchieson et al. 1979:33).
When present, bison undoubtedly would have been the single most important animal resource
available to the prehistoric inhabitants of the Wilbarger County area. Additional important
species may have included deer, antelope, peccary (javelina), bear, turkey, dove, prairie chicken,
quail, turtle, and fish. The most serious environmental limitation on the animals in the area, both
today and in the past, is undoubtedly the salinity of the surface water. Faunal collections made in
connection with the initial environmental evaluations of the Truscott and Crowell brine lake areas
indicate that the high salinity of the water decreases the availability of aquatic resources, such as
invertebrates (e.g., mollusks and annelids were totally absent from the collections), fish, and
amphibians (Etchieson et al. 1979:32–33).

SYNTHESIS OF THE REGIONAL PALEOENVIRONMENTAL SEQUENCE
A great deal of time has been devoted to studies of the paleoenvironment of the Southern Great
Plains, but little of it has been directly concerned with the Lower Plains—or Central Rolling Red
Plains—of Texas. One of the earliest efforts at paleoenvironmental reconstruction in the greater
southwest was that of Antevs (1955), and while the model he presented was developed for
Arizona and other parts of the western United States, its general outline also appears to be
accurate for the Southern Great Plains. Subsequent to Antevs’s effort, many investigations have
concentrated more particularly on the Southern Plains (Baerris and Bryson 1965; Bryant and
Shafer 1977; Collins 1968; Dillehay 1974; Duffield 1970; Ferring 1982, 1986; Hall 1982, 1988;
Henderson 1976; Holliday 1988, 1989; Hughes 1978; Jelinek 1967; Johnson and Holliday 1986;
Lintz 1978; Patton 1977; Stafford 1981; Wilson 1972), and while most of these have been
concerned with the High Plains area to the west, two recent studies have considered areas closer
to the project area (i.e., Abbott 1990; Gustavson 1986).
A recent overview of the paleoenvironment of the Texas Plains has been presented by Hughes
(1991). Hughes identifies three main climatic periods following the end of the Pleistocene
(Hughes 1991:Table 1): an Anathermal period (ca. 9500–5000 B.C.); an Altithermal period (ca.
5000–2000 B.C.); and finally a Medithermal period (ca. 2000 B.C.–present). The period of
Anathermal conditions was characterized by a cool, moist climate, with plentiful surface water
and higher levels of vegetation than today. Throughout the period, temperatures were
progressively increasing and levels of precipitation were decreasing, with a consequent reduction
in the amount of vegetation present. During this period, Bison antiquus disappeared and modern
bison herds were in decline (Hughes 1991:7–9).

10

During the succeeding Altithermal period, the climate was much warmer and drier than it had
been previously or than it is today. The greatly increased levels of evaporation and reduced
precipitation diminished the amount of vegetation present, which in turn led to decreasing
numbers of large game animals on the plains and a great increase in levels of erosion and
deflation (Hughes 1991:7–9). In the subsequent period of Medithermal climate, there was a
return to more moist and cooler conditions, with the period from A.D. 200–1100 characterized by
conditions somewhat cooler and more moist than today. With the increasing levels of
precipitation, surface water returned to the region, soil deposition and development resumed, and
large game animals returned as well. Finally, some indications suggest that throughout the
current period, the climate has been becoming gradually warmer and drier (Hughes 1991:7–9).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION
This chapter is subdivided into two sections: Previous Investigations and Regional Culture
History. The Previous Investigation section provides an overview of the archeological research
conducted within a 1-kilometer radius of the APE. The goal of presenting such information is to
provide an understanding of the amount of research conducted and a general overview of the
distribution of cultural resources within the immediate vicinity of the project area. The Regional
Culture History section provides an overview of the general culture history consensus accepted
by the professional archeological community for the region.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the site files at the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Texas Sites Atlas) was conducted to examine the records of known sites within 1 kilometer of
the APE. A total of three surveys and one testing project has been conducted with the 1kilometer radius of the current project. None of these reports was available for review; rather the
presented evidence related to these three surveys was largely gathered from site forms and survey
boundaries provided by the Atlas.
Two of the surveys were for transportation-related projects, and the third survey and the testing
project were conducted for a proposed expansion of the Vernon Wastewater Treatment Plant.
Only the survey conducted for the treatment plant resulted in the identification of a site. Site
41WG16 was recorded in March 1981, approximately 0.8 kilometers east of the current APE (see
Figure 1). It was identified as a prehistoric lithic scatter and occupation area with some early–
midtwentieth-century ceramics and glass. It was considered potentially eligible for NRHP
inclusion and was tested to determine its eligibility (Fox 1981). However, no site form update
exists, likely due to the fact, as witnessed through recent aerial photographs, the proposed
treatment plant expansion never occurred. As a result of this background research no previously
recorded archeological sites are located within the project area.

REGIONAL CULTURE HISTORY
As a number of writers have noted, an understanding of the prehistoric chronology for the Lower
Plains of Texas has not advanced much beyond Ray and Sayles’s standardization of terminology
in 1941. Since then, advances have been made in Central Texas to the south, Northcentral Texas
to the east, and the High Plains to the west. As a result, chronology in the Lower Plains is heavily
dependent upon correlations with those areas (Etchieson et al. 1979). At the present time, six
major cultural/historical periods are recognized as being applicable in this area: Paleo-Indian,
Archaic, Plains Woodland (Formative), Plains Village (Florescent), Protohistoric/Early Historic,
and Euro-American Historic (Table 1). Brief discussions of these cultural stages and their
associated developments and external relationships are presented below.

Paleo-Indian
The first unequivocal period of human occupation in the Southern Great Plains, as with all of
North America, is the Paleo-Indian period. The Paleo-Indian period encompassed the very end of
the Pleistocene epoch, when glacial conditions still affected much of North America. Based upon
the most recent archeological assessments (Frison 1978; Frison and Todd 1986; Hofman
1989a:25–26, 31–33; Hofman et al. 1989:158–161; West 1983:337), populations associated with
the Paleo-Indian period likely originated from the vast interior regions of northeastern Siberia and
crossed the Bering land bridge into North America during the end of the Wisconsin Glacial
Maximum. Once in North America, Paleo-Indian populations entered the Great Plains east of the
13

Rockies and quickly moved south into the southern region. Climatic conditions across the
Southern Great Plains at that time were more humid and cooler, with less extreme temperature
changes between the winter and summer months (Hofman et al 1989:159). Due to the higher
amounts of precipitation, boreal forests may have existed periodically in some parts of the
Southern Great Plains.
The subsistence pattern of Paleo-Indian populations was oriented toward a highly mobile
existence that allowed groups to follow seasonally available vegetal resources as well as the
migratory patterns of large mammals over great distances (Broilo 1971; Meltzer 1987). These
groups of Paleo-Indian populations probably consisted of microbands composed of less than 20
individuals. In the western hemisphere, the limited number of Paleo-Indian sites has produced
cultural remains associated with kill sites of large Pleistocene mammals, such as mammoths,
mastodon, bison, and horse, collectively referred to as megafauna. Because of the ephemeral
nature of the Paleo-Indian sites, however, the concept of “big game hunters” is likely misleading,
for, as with all aboriginal populations, much of the diet probably consisted of vegetal resources,
with meat from the megafaunal kills being an added element of nutrition. The nonperishable
cultural remains of the Paleo-Indian tradition have been found to center around a highly portable
lithic industry that was focused on the production of bifacially worked lanceolate projectile points
and unifacial scrapers, produced from large flakes or blades (Hofman et al. 1989:160). Well-made
bone tools such as points, shaft straighteners, awls, and needles are also commonly associated
with Paleo-Indian assemblages. Other than abraders, ground stone is not commonly found among
Paleo-Indian components.

Potential Pre-Clovis Remains
Three possible pre-Clovis sites are located north of the project area in Oklahoma. The Cooperton
site, a purported mammoth-scavenging site in Kiowa County, Oklahoma, has yielded remains of a
single immature male mammoth (Mamuthus columbi) in alluvial sediments, along with somewhat
equivocal evidence of an association with early man (Anderson 1975). This evidence consists of
the pattern of bone fracturing, believed to be green-bone fractures indicative of human activity,
and of four cobbles, interpreted as an anvil and hammerstones used to break the bones. Three
radiocarbon dates on bone apatite place the death of the animal at sometime between 20,000 and
17,000 years before present, suggesting that the site may have been the locus of pre-Clovis
activity (Gettys 1984:Table 4.1).
Farther to the north in Oklahoma are the Bartow site (Agenbroad 1984; Kerr 1964) and the
Burnham site (Flynn et al. 1988). The Bartow site (34WD13) is located in Woodward County
and consists of a mammoth skeleton with a radiocarbon age of 11,990 ± 170 years (10,040 B.C.)
(Haynes et al. 1971; Meltzer and Mead 1985). Possible artifacts associated with these remains
consisted of “a flint rock . . . which was angular in form[;] . . . a series of small, irregular flakes as
might have been removed incidental to scraping activity[; and] . . . a quartzite flake or chip . . . ”
(Kerr 1964:5). Finally, recent work at the Burnham site (34WO73) in Woods County has yielded
evidence of giant Pleistocene bison associated with chert flakes and implements in a possible preClovis context (Flynn et al. 1988).

14

Early Paleo-Indian
The earliest securely dated Paleo-Indian period within the Southern Great Plains is represented by
the Clovis complex. The Clovis complex is defined by the presence of basally fluted Clovis
projectile points, which are often associated with the butchered remains of extinct animals. The
Clovis or Llano complex (Sellards 1952) was the first defined, and is best represented, in the
Great Plains by mammoth kill sites, the majority of which have been found in the southern
region. Clovis-age sites in the region are usually situated along small drainages, such as arroyos,
or along playa edges where it was advantageous to overtake large mammals.
In the Southern Great Plains, the Clovis complex was succeeded by the Folsom complex, which
is believed to have developed from the former (Judge 1973). The Folsom complex began
approximately 9500 B.C. and last for about 500 years (Hofman 1989b:38–44). The complex is
defined by the presence of channel-fluted Folsom projectile points that are often associated with
the remains of an extinct species of bison. Like Clovis, the Folsom complex is best represented
by kill sites in the Great Plains, the majority of which have been located in the southern region.

Late Paleo-Indian
A number of late Paleo-Indian complexes have been associated with the more generalized Plano
macrocomplex in the Southern Great Plains (Hofman 1989b:38–44). The Plano macrocomplex is
defined by unfluted lanceolate projectile points, of which particular points types demarcate the
smaller subregional complexes. Within the Southern Great Plains are the Plainview, Milnesand,
Agate Basin, Portales, Cody Firstview, and Allen/Fredrick complexes.
Archeological sites associated with the generalized Plano macrocomplex represent kill sites that
contain all of the elements of the Paleo-Indian tradition. A key difference, though, is that Planoage components contain the remains of modern fauna, especially modern bison (Hofman
1989b:38–44). The appearance of modern fauna also demarcates the beginning of the Holocene
epoch. Nevertheless, economic patterns remained similar, indicating that Plano-age populations
were still practicing a highly mobile existence dependent upon seasonal vegetal resources and the
pursuit of large migratory animals. Plano-age components found near and in the area include
Blackwater Draw, Lubbock Lake, San Jon, Milnesand, Plainview, and Rex Rogers.

Archaic Period
The subsequent period in the Southern Great Plains is generally labeled the Archaic and is
divided into three general cultural subperiods: the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic. The Archaic
as a whole is characterized by a diverse utilization of a wide array of modern plant and animal
species, in what is generally assumed to have been a diffuse foraging economy (Hofman
1989b:44–47; Hughes 1984). Despite this, the single most important resource in the region, when
it was available, was bison. Present evidence, however, suggests that bison were not abundant in
the Southern Plains between around 7,000 and 3,500 years ago. Archaic peoples probably were
more restricted in their seasonal rounds, on the basis of evidence for more frequent and intensive
reoccupation of many sites and more intensive local resource usage during this period. The
evidence for increasingly restricted movements, more frequent reoccupations, more intensive
usage of local resources, and simply an increased number of sites has been taken by many to be
indicative of steadily increasing population levels throughout the Archaic.
15

Characteristic artifacts generally associated with Archaic sites on the Southern Plains include
grinding tools (presumably for processing vegetal foods), roasting ovens, rock-lined hearths, and
a variety of notched and stemmed projectile points. The presence of these assemblages appear to
set sites apart from earlier Paleo-Indian sites, and the absence of bow-and-arrow and ceramic
technology serves to distinguish Archaic sites from subsequent Plains Woodland stage sites.
Archaic sites tend to be small open camps or workshops and generally are characterized by large
numbers of burned hearth stones or boiling pebbles. Hughes (1976) has suggested that earlier
sites are characterized by limited numbers of dart points, along with a relative abundance of
gouges (i.e., Clear Fork gouges), choppers, and hammers; later sites contain corner-indented and
corner-notched dart points, ovate to triangular knives, thick end scrapers, small manos, and thin
grinding slabs. The subsistence pattern is assumed to have become more diffuse, reflecting a
greater exploitation of local environments, and there was probably an increase in the dietary
importance of smaller game animals, fish, and wild plant foods in comparison to the earlier
Paleo-Indian period. Archaic peoples probably continued to follow a nomadic way of life,
traveling seasonally to utilize different food resources in various localities (Weir 1976a, 1976b).
At the present time, many researchers feel that throughout the Archaic period, the southern part of
the Lower Plains of Texas was closely tied to Central Texas. This has resulted in the adjacent
Central Texas projectile point and the subsequently formulated substage chronologies to be
applied to this region, despite the lack of sufficient local data (Etchieson et al. 1978, 1979;
Thurmond et al. 1981). The data presently available relating to the Archaic from the Texas
Lower Plains is largely based on surficial evidence, and needs to be further refined.

Early Archaic
On the Southern Great Plains in general, the Early Archaic subperiod can be dated between about
6000/5000 and 3000 B.C. (Etchieson et al. 1978). This period would have encompassed the end
of the transition from Paleo-Indian to Archaic, and by this time the earlier lanceolate point styles
had been largely replaced by stemmed dart points. This period also would have spanned the
Altithermal or postglacial thermal maximum, which has been dated to between about 5000 and
3000/2500 B.C. (Story 1985:25).
On the Lower Plains of Texas, Etchieson et al. (1978) have defined an Initial Archaic (ca. 5000–
3000 B.C.) during the Early Archiac, largely on the basis of comparisons with Central Texas. In
Central Texas and along the coastal plain, concentrations of Archaic sites dating to this period
occur along the southern and southeastern edges of the Edwards Plateau. Although these clusters
could be artificial (i.e., the result of sample bias), this region also may have been more intensively
exploited than other areas. It is ecotonal in character and may have provided reliable resources
during times of environmental stress (Story 1985:31, 34). By analogy with Central Texas,
economic systems on the Lower Plains of Texas during this period were probably diffuse,
utilizing a variety of resources and frequently shifting the loci of subsistence activities rather than
intensifying the use of any specified resource (Story 1985:39). Dart points from the Lower Plains
of Texas that may date to this period include Bell, Martindale, Gower, and possibly Golondrina,
Angostura, and Meserve.

16

Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic in the Southern Great Plains in general has been dated to between about
3000 and 1000 B.C. (Hofman 1989a:Table 1), but it is actually less well-understood than either
the preceding or the subsequent periods. Within the Lower Plains in particular, Etchieson et al.
(1978) equates this period with two phases of the Middle Archaic in Central Texas, the Clear
Fork and the Round Rock, respectively. In Central Texas this period exhibits more numerous
remains from more sites, although our knowledge is still incomplete.
Once again, by analogy with Central Texas, this period on the Lower Plains may have been
characterized by a population increase; the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns;
and changes in settlement patterns, economic and social systems, and technology. In addition,
territorial boundaries may have begun to emerge (Story 1985:39). Interestingly enough, the
burned rock middens that are so characteristic of this period in Central Texas are not found on the
Texas Lower Plains. Dart points are assumed to continue to be related to Central Texas and are
represented by stemmed and notched styles (e.g., Nolan, Bulverde, Pedernales, and Marshall),
although the first indications of divergence appears in the form of Carrollton points along the
Clear Fork of the Brazos. The triangular Baird and Taylor points (varieties of Tortugas) are also
apparently characteristic of this period in the Abilene area. Clear Fork gouges, bifaces, a variety
of scrapers, and unifaces are also present.

Late Archaic
As is the case in many other regions, the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains appears to represent
a population maximum. The bison had apparently returned in abundance by the beginning of the
Late Archaic period and would certainly have provided an important resource, although the
evidence also suggests a continuing utilization of other resources in the area as well.
On the Lower Plains specifically, Etchieson et al. (1978) designate a Late Archaic period which is
roughly analogous to the final phase of the Middle Archaic (the San Marcos) and the first phase
of the Late Archaic (the Uvalde) period in Central Texas. Overall, this is a period that is
characterized by the emergence of new cultural patterns, as well as the intensification of
preexisting ones (Story 1985:45). Sites of this period in the Abilene area include campsites. The
lithic assemblages contain a variety of dart point styles with relationships to both Central Texas
(i.e., Nolan, Castroville, Marcos, Pedernales, Fairland, Bulverde, Ensor, Darl, Williams,
Palmillas, Frio, and Lange) and to Northcentral Texas (i.e., Yarbrough-like, Ellis, Godley,
Eliasville [a variant of Godley], Edgewood, and Trinity). Clear Fork gouges probably continued
to be used, along with gravers, scrapers, and a variety of unifaces and bifaces. In the Justiceburg
area, southwest of Foard County, the Late Archaic period has been dated between 2550 and 50
B.C., with a limited number of diagnostic artifacts including gouges and Castroville, Ensor,
Mahomet, Nolan, and Marcos dart points (Boyd et al. 1989:198–199; Boyd and Tomka
1990:258).

Plains Woodland Period (Formative)
By the beginning of the Christian Era, or shortly before, a number of technological changes had
been added to most of the Archaic cultures of the Southern Great Plains, technological changes
setting the subsequent Plains Woodland stage apart from the previous Archaic (Hofman and
17

Brooks 1989). The most important and visible change in the archeological record involves the
shift from the use of darts and dart points to the bow-and-arrow with associated small arrow
points. A second important shift was the introduction of ceramic technology (in the form of
cordmarked, grit- or bone-tempered vessels), probably sometime during the first half of the first
millennium A.D. The period of time during which these innovations first took hold and spread
has generally been called the Woodland or Plains Woodland stage (ca. A.D. 1–800; see Table 1).
To the south, this period overlaps with the Terminal Archaic period (ca. A.D. 1–500; Etchieson et
al. 1978) and is equivalent to the early part of the Late Prehistoric I period (ca. A.D. 500–1200),
while on the High Plains to the west, Hughes (1991) has most recently termed it the Early NeoIndian substage (ca. A.D. 200–1100). Apparently, social groups on the Southern Plains, in
general, were greatly affected during this period by developments along the western edge of the
Eastern Woodlands and among Mogollon and Basketmaker cultures of the Southwest. It should
be noted that despite some variations, climatic conditions during the first millennium A.D. were
apparently generally moister than either the preceding or subsequent periods (Hofman and Brooks
1989:61). In addition, evidence suggests that bison were less plentiful on the Southern Plains
during this period and that primary economic emphasis may have shifted to deer during these
centuries. Evidence of occupation in the Southern Great Plains throughout this time is less
common that that for the earlier Archaic stages, but archeological remains of this period do seem
to show continued similarities to those of Central Texas, although they may not be as closely
related as were the earlier Archaic cultures.
In the Lower Plains specifically, Etchieson et al. (1978) define a Terminal Archaic period on the
Lower Plains of Texas that is coeval with the early part of the Plains Woodland (Formative) stage
in the Southern Great Plains, based on the Late Archaic period in Central Texas (i.e., the Twin
Sisters phase). The period begins around A.D. 1 and ends at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period on the Lower Plains, which they place at A.D. 500 (according to Prewitt [1985] the Twin
Sisters phase ended at about A.D. 550 in Central Texas). To the south of the Lower Plains, in
Central Texas, Prewitt (1981) suggests that this period was marked by a heavier emphasis on
gathering activities than on hunting and that it is characterized by a proliferation of formal tool
types other than projectile points which reflects a diversified, but intensive, exploitative system.
Characteristic point types in Central Texas during this period include Darl, Frio, Ensor, Fairland,
and Kinney types; while Etchieson et al. (1978) identify almost a dozen dart point types which
they suggest characterize this period on the Lower Plains, including Carrizo, Catan, Darl, Elam,
Ensor, Fairland, Frio, Kent, Kinney, Palmillas, and Yarbrough.

Plains Village Period (Florescent)
After about A.D. 800, a large portion of the Southern Great Plains was occupied by sedentary or
semisedentary agricultural societies that have been collectively referred to as the “Plains Village
tradition” (Brooks 1989). Sites in the eastern portion of the Southern Plains appear to show
strong influences from the groups participating in the Mississippian tradition to the east, while
Plains Village sites to the west show similar relationships with Puebloan societies in the
Southwest. Because of the large number of sites belonging to this period and the extensive
research efforts that they have attracted, numerous variants, aspects, phases, foci, and complexes
have been described for the Plains Village period throughout the Southern Plains (Brooks 1989).

18

The village sites of the Plains Village period are all small and are found primarily along major
river or stream systems, on fertile soils with a high degree of agricultural productivity. They
apparently include both true, clustered village communities and more isolated, or scattered,
farmsteads. Such sites contain houses, numerous cache or storage pits, sheet middens, and
occasional burials or cemetery areas. The available data indicate that in addition to agriculture
(or perhaps more properly, horticulture), these societies were supported by a heavy reliance on
game hunting (especially bison, but also deer), fishing and shellfishing, and wild plant collecting.
Agricultural crops apparently included corn and beans (both documented in the archeological
record), as well as probably squash, sunflower, tobacco, and other crops.
The end of the Late Prehistoric period on the Lower Plains is tentatively dated at between A.D.
500 and 1200, making it roughly contemporaneous with the Austin phase in Central Texas
(Prewitt 1981), with Late Prehistoric I in Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1990)
On the Lower Plains of Texas, the Plains Village period is roughly contemporary with the later
portion of the Late Prehistoric I (ca. A.D. 800–1200) and all of the Late Prehistoric II (ca. A.D.
1200–1541). In this area, this period appears to be characterized initially by contracting-stem
arrow points (i.e., Perdiz, Cliffton), which apparently declined in frequency and were replaced by
various triangular forms (i.e., Fresno, Harrell, Washita, and Garza). Extensive extraregional
contact is indicated on the basis of pottery from the Frankston phase in East Texas, Leon Plain
pottery from the Toyah phase in Central Texas, and a variety of Mogollon and Anasazi painted
wares. Other diagnostic artifacts appear to be small end scrapers and diamond-shaped, beveled
knives. Also during this period, sites that may represent components of the Antelope Creek phase
(see below) may have extended southward as far as Motley County, around the headwaters of the
Pease River. These components are characterized by Fresno, Washita, and Harrell points,
associated with Borger Cordmarked pottery. With bison apparently available again on the Lower
Plains during this time (Dillehay 1974), there was probably a dramatic shift in the subsistence
economy. A similar artifact assemblage in Central Texas has been interpreted as indicating a
strong orientation toward bison procurement and processing (Prewitt 1981:74, 84). Although
trade with eastern and western agriculturalists as well as a strong cultural relationship with sites
of the Plains Village tradition undoubtedly existed, the lack of extensive excavation data on the
Lower Plains of Texas makes it impossible to tell how important the cultigens may have been to
these Late Prehistoric hunters.

Protohistoric Native American Period
The Protohistoric Native American period within the Southern Great Plains focuses on the
movements and lifeways of indigenous populations spanning the time from when European
explorers first entered the area to the time when historic accounts and documents became more
prevalent after Euro-American settlement (Hofman 1989a:91).
In 1541, Coronado trekked across the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and probably came into
contact with Athabaskan-speaking Apachean groups who had been moving into the Southern
Great Plains from the northwest (Habicht-Mauche 1985; Hofman 1984:348). These Apachean
groups were primarily nomadic bison hunters and traders, and were often in contact with the
Jumano from the La Junta area and with pubebloan groups residing in the northern Rio Grande
area. In western Oklahoma, Protohistoric archeological components, called the Edwards and
Wheeler complexes, have been identified along the southern Canadian and Wichita rivers and are

believed to be Apachean (Hofman 1984:348–254). These complexes date from about A.D. 1500
to 1725 and are possibly related to the Dismal River aspect characterized by a thin, black, sandypaste pottery that has been reported throughout the Southern Great Plains. The ceramic tradition
associated with these Apachean Protohistoric manifestations is different from other Plains Village
ceramics, which were thicker and were tempered with grit, bone, limestone, or shell (Hofman
1989a:96). In the Texas Panhandle, the Garza (A.D. 1500–1650) and the Terra Blanca (A.D.
1400–1650) complexes are comparable manifestations to the Edwards and Wheeler complexes in
material culture and in subsistence practices (Habicht-Mauche 1985; Hofman 1989a:98–99). The
archeological data from sites associated with the Garza and Tierra Blanca complexes indicate that
there was a strong emphasis on bison hunting with little reliance on horticulture (Hofman
1989a:99).
Based on early interviews with Kiowa and Apache informants, the Antelope Creek settlements
along the Canadian River valley had been abandoned prior to the arrival of Apachean groups in
the Southern Great Plains, supporting the termination date of the Antelope Creek phase placed at
about A.D. 1500 (Lintz 1986). By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Apache were
forced out of the Texas Panhandle by the incoming Comanche who had originated from the High
Rolling Plains habitat in present-day Wyoming. By this time, French guns and Spanish horses
had been introduced into the Southern Great Plains and had been incorporated by both the
Apache and Comanche.

Historic Native American Period
The beginning of the Historic Native American period in the Southern Great Plains region is
somewhat arbitrary; however, it can be defined by the reported presence of the fully mounted
Plains Indian tribes of the Apache, Comanche, and Kiowa after 1750. Much of what is known
about these groups comes from the chronicles of traveling Spanish missionaries and military
expeditions. Archeological sites relating to those particular Native American groups tend to be
ephemeral and poorly understood. Metal arrow points, gun flints, and tipi rings are often the only
indicators of sites associated with these Plains Indian groups. From the mid-eighteenth century to
the 1870s, the Lower Plains areas were the established tribal hunting grounds for the Comanche
and the Kiowa. In fact, these two Native American groups had virtual control over the Lower
Plains until after the Civil War. In 1867, both the Comanche and Kiowa signed a peace treaty
with the U.S. government at Medicine Lodge, Kansas, in which the two tribes agreed to give up
their tribal hunting grounds in exchange for reservations in present-day Oklahoma (Hughes and
Speer 1981:30). Nevertheless, both the Comanche and the Kiowa, in addition to some Cheyenne,
continued to use their traditional hunting grounds until 1875. With the incursion of AngloAmerican bison hunters in 1874, hostilities began between the tribes and Anglo-Americans,
precipitating in the so-called Red River War of 1874–1875. The defeat of a large force of
Comanche, Kiowa, and Cheyenne at Palo Duro Canyon in 1874 essentially ended the dominance
of Native Americans in the area (Webb and Carroll 1952:328).

Historic Euro-American Period
Wilbarger County was established in 1858 from lands formerly assigned to the Bexar District. It
was named for settlers Josiah P. and Mathias Wilbarger. Though the area was within the
boundary of the Peters colony, because of Indian hostilities, attracted no settlers until 1878 when
20

the first settlement was made and the county was attached to Clay County for judicial purposes.
Once settlers began to enter the area, those who lacked livestock made a living poisoning coyotes
for their hides; gathering buffalo bones for eastern fertilizer plants was another source of income.
Bone gatherers hauled their take to Gainesville, where bones sold for $20 to $22 per ton. The
county’s tall sage grass supported antelope, deer, buffalo, wild turkey, and prairie chickens, and
in season the land offered wild plums, grapes, currants, persimmons, and pecans for the taking.
By 1880, 126 people were living in the area, comprising 30 farms or ranches, encompassing
4,800 acres (Jones 1986; Ross 1933; and Texas Sites Atlas 2007).
Wilbarger County was formerly organized in 1881, and the town of Vernon was designated the
county seat. The county grew quickly during the 1880s, despite droughts in 1886 and 1887, the
prevalence of prairie dogs, and occasional rampages of stampeding cattle from the seasonal cattle
drives that traveled through the area. In 1886 the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway arrived in
Vernon, connecting the county to outside markets and encouraging immigration. The importance
of the railroad to early development was recognized by local ranchers, who had donated rights-ofway. Relations with Indians were friendly during the 1880s. Quanah Parker and his Comanche
followers visited the Doan family frequently, and Comanche-Kiowa Indians from Oklahoma
marketed in Vernon with their government allotments in the 1880s (Jones 1986; Ross 1933; Atlas
2007).
A newspaper, the Vernon Weekly Call, was established in 1889. By 1890, there were 720 farms
and ranches, encompassing almost 313,000 acres, in Wilbarger County, and the population had
increased to 7,092. Ranching had become important as had crop and poultry farming. The
agricultural boom suffered serious loses during the 1890s, and by 1900 only 636 farms remained
and the population had dropped to 5,759. Nevertheless, crop acreage expanded as a result of
shifting agricultural technology, and the agricultural economy rapidly expanded between 1900
and 1920 as hundreds of new farmers moved into the area. By 1910 the county was in the throws
of another population boom and a total of 1,435 farms and ranches existed in the county, and the
population grew rapidly from 12,000 in 1910 to 15,112 in 1920 (Jones 1986; Ross 1933; Texas
Sites Atlas 2007).
Immigration continued during the 1920s, and as cotton cultivation spread rapidly across the
county, the petroleum industry began. The first oil well in the county had been drilled in 1908,
and a producing well followed in 1915, but significant production awaited the drilling of the
South Vernon field in 1923. Soon the oilfield was extended across much of the south part of the
county from the Wichita County line west through the Flukman field. By 1930, 24,579 people
were living in Wilbarger County (Jones 1986; Ross 1933; Texas Sites Atlas 2007).
The cotton economy was devastated during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Though cotton
production remained a significant part of the economy after the depression, it would never again
rise to its former glory. The county lost 800 farms during the 1930s, and by 1940 only 1,300
remained. The rapidly developing petroleum industry helped to offset some of these losses; in
1938 more than 3,369,000 barrels of oil were produced in the county. Nevertheless, 20 percent of
the population moved away during the depression, and by 1940 only 20,474 people lived there.
Agriculture experienced another revival during the 1940s and the number of farms again grew,
but soon thereafter farm consolidations and the mechanization of agriculture combined to drive
down the number of farms. By 1959 there were only 873 farms, and of these only 340 were
operated by tenants. The county population reached 20,552 in 1950 but then declined to 17,748
by 1960 and to 15,355 by 1970. Meanwhile cattle again became important to the economy, as
21

petroleum production grew rapidly during the 1950s and early 1960s, but then began to decline.
Production increased from 3,176,000 barrels in 1948 to 5,456,000 barrels in 1956 and to
6,011,000 barrels in 1965 (Jones 1986; Ross 1933; Texas Sites Atlas 2007).
The oil and gas industry remained important to the economy during the 1970s and 1980s, even
though production declined. The agricultural income was diversified during this period as
income was earned from newly introduced crops such as wheat, cotton, hay, oats, guar, and
watermelons. Cattle and hogs were the county’s primary livestock that paved the way for new
industries that included meat packing and ultimately the manufacture of resins, plastics, and
men’s clothing (Jones 1986; Ross 1933; Texas Sites Atlas 2007).

CHAPTER 4
RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

INTRODUCTION
These investigations were designed to identify prehistoric and historic archeological sites located
within the approximately 2.2 miles of proposed road improvements along U.S. 283 north of
Vernon, Texas. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. to locate archeological resources occurring within the designated survey area
2. to assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and for SAL designation
Potential cultural resources were identified through a program of background research for
potential sites and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing, using the field methods
described below.

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
A review of the site files at the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was conducted to examine the
records for known sites within 1 kilometer of the APE, which was discussed in the Previous
Archeological Investigations section in Chapter 3. Additional archival resources consulted
include the 2006 Texas historic overlay GIS (geographic information system) maps for the
purpose of identifying the locations any potential historic structures within or adjacent to the
project area (Foster et al. 2006). Finally, two literature searches for pertinent archeological work
in the general Wilbarger County area were undertaken at both the Fondren Library located on the
Southern Methodist University campus and the Geo-Marine, Inc., library to provide a context for
the current investigation.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
Two GMI archeologists conducted the archeological survey of this project area by walking a
single transect, excavating judgmental shovel tests, and mechanically excavating archeological
trenches near the proposed location of improvements to the Pease River bridge, as determined by
23

the Project Archeologist. Prior to conducting this survey, Texas Excavation Safety System
(Digtess) and Texas One Call were contacted and both agencies indicated an absence of utilities
or pipelines in the area to be mechanically excavated near the Pease River bridge. On the single
transects, shovel tests were excavated in leapfrog fashion, and the judgmental shovel test
locations were selected based on the observed landscape and results of the background research.
Prior to fieldwork, the APE was translated from a CADD file into a Shapefile and was then
uploaded onto a Trimble global positioning system (GPS) backpack unit. This Trimble unit was
referenced during fieldwork to determine and document the location of shovel tests since the
preexisting ROW was not clearly marked on the ground. Upon completion of fieldwork,
collected GPS data were downloaded and used as the basis for the maps presented in this report.
The Project Archeologist maintained field notes that documented survey conditions, vegetation
cover, area covered daily, and initial interpretations of cultural properties, and kept a photograph
log that documented each photograph taken.
Examination of topographical maps, basic knowledge of regional archeological site distribution
patterning, and visual inspection of the landforms at the time of survey in combination with the
observed soil profiles from shovel tests formed the basis for determining the intensity of
investigation and the placement of judgmental shovel tests within the project area. The entire
project area is considered to be of low probability for containing archeological deposits because it
is composed almost entirely of upland deposits. Therefore, it was decided a combination of
systematic and judgmental shovel tests be excavated in accordance with current survey standards
for linear projects (e.g., a minimum of 16 shovel tests per linear mile) as approved by the Texas
Historical Commission. It was also agreed that shovel tests would be excavated in areas where
ground cover hindered site detection or in areas of high site probability such as along creek
margins. Should areas along the project corridor be identified as having been previously altered
or impacted (e.g., urban sprawl, buried utilities, highway construction, etc.) or exhibiting large
areas of bedrock at the surface, shovel tests were not excavated but the areas were
photodocumented. During fieldwork, all exposed surface areas such as road cuts, animal
burrows, and plowed fields were closely inspected for cultural material.
A total of 25 shovel tests and seven archeological trenches was excavated within state-owned
ROW during this survey. The locations of all judgmental shovel tests and archeological trenches
were recorded as a GPS point, and the systematic shovel tests were conducted in areas defined by
clearly identifiable landscape features. The 32 excavation units exceed the minimum of shovel
tests required by Texas Historical Commission guidelines for a project of this size and
configuration, especially when subtracting those locations of known or observed disturbance. In
all cases, shovel tests measured approximately 30 cm in diameter and were excavated either to the
top of the Bt-horizon (subsoil) or to 80 cm below ground surface. The soil from each shovel test
was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-inch) hardware cloth, and each shovel test was backfilled.
In all cases, attempts were made to excavate the archeological trenches to a depth of 2.5–3 m
below surface (bs) with a length of 4–5 m. Unfortunately, given the presence of a shallow
localized water table (1.2–1.8 m bs) these trenches could only be excavated to approximately this
depth, at which point the saturated sands caused the trench walls to collapse. These limitations
limited the amount of time GMI archeologists could spend in the trenches, but documentation and
evaluation of the trench profiles were completed.
When a cultural artifact was encountered, either surface or subsurface, a series of four shovel
tests in a cruciform pattern (one in each cardinal direction) around the initial find was excavated,
if space allows. Site designation was applied only to clusters of surface artifacts (i.e., greater than
24

10 artifacts), clusters of subsurface artifacts (two or more positive shovel tests), or significant
architectural properties. If no further cultural remains were located, the original artifact was
recorded as an isolated find (or locality), photographed, recorded in field notes, and plotted on
applicable topographic maps, and the survey continued.
If cultural material is located in any of the additional shovel tests, the find is recorded as a site,
and shovel testing continued in the cruciform pattern until a sterile shovel test is encountered to
fully delineate the site areal extent within the project corridor. The additional shovel tests is used
to obtain estimates of the site depth, contents, and integrity. Each recorded site is identified with
a permanent datum marker consisting of a ⅝-inch-diameter metal rebar stake placed on the site.
This marker is topped with an aluminum cap bearing the site’s temporary GMI field number, and
the site datum location recorded using GPS. A scaled pace-and-compass map is prepared,
showing the site boundary, shovel test locations, cultural and topographic features, generalized
contour intervals, and any integral onsite vegetation, as well as any other specific aspects of the
site. The site is photographed from several viewpoints with a digital camera; any damage from
vandalism, construction, or earth disturbances is also photodocumented. These photographs are
recorded in a photo log. A State of Texas site recording form would be prepared, noting
locational information, vegetation cover, contextual integrity, estimated period of occupation, and
artifactual material (both surface and subsurface). The site location is plotted on the appropriate
project and topographic maps.
All artifacts recovered from shovel tests on both site and nonsite (isolated occurrence) areas are
collected. Though modern artifact materials were recovered from two shovel tests (ST 2 and ST
3) during survey, the materials were not collected but were photographed. Wherever possible,
limited surface collections of temporally and/or functionally diagnostic artifacts are implemented
to expand the sample of materials used in evaluating the cultural affiliation, age, and other
research-potential issues about the site.

CURATED MATERIAL
All records and materials generated from this project were returned to the GMI laboratory
facilities in Plano, and labeled or recorded in compliance with TARL standards. All documents
and materials related to this project will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, upon completion of the project (Appendix A).

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

INTRODUCTION
As a result of the present survey, a total of 25 shovel tests and seven archeological trenches was
excavated within the existing state-owned ROW of U.S. 283; no archeological sites were
documented. An examination of topographical maps, basic knowledge of regional archeological
site distribution patterning, and visual inspection of the landforms at the time of survey was used
to determine the intensity of the investigation strategy employed.
This chapter provides an overview of the survey corridor, work conducted, and a brief discussion
of the findings by corridor segment from the northern end to the southern terminus of the project
area.

OVERVIEW OF SURVEY CORRIDOR
The project area consists of 2.2 miles of preexisting ROW along U.S. 283 north of Vernon
between U.S. 287 and FM 925. A combination of the previously conducted background research
and the consideration of ground conditions at the time of survey resulted in the subdivision of the
project area into five sequentially lettered segments defined on the basis of natural and
constructed landscape features (Figure 2). Each of these segments is discussed in turn through
the remaining portion of this chapter.

Survey Area: Segment A
This segment of the project area extended from FM 925 to CR 2072. The geological and soil
background data indicated this segment consisted of windblown Quaternary deposits and likely
had the potential to contain buried soils or evidence of obscured higher terraces (USDA 2007).
Based on this information, a systematic shovel-testing program at 60-m intervals was used to test
this upland section. The shovel testing began on the southwestern corner of the intersection of
FM 925 and U.S. 283 and continued southward along the western ROW until reaching the point
where CR 2072 intersects U.S. 283. GMI archeologists then crossed U.S. 283 and excavated
shovel tests northward along the eastern ROW (see Figure 2).

The second and third shovel tests within the western ROW (Figure 3) produced recent-age
historic materials consisting of machine-made brick, metal, and half of a Coca-Cola bottle at
depths between 20 and 50 cm below surface (bs). Three additional delineation shovel tests were
excavated north and south of the second shovel test where the materials were first identified and
yielded green Styrofoam, brown glass (likely beer bottle fragments), an aluminum can, small
brick fragments, and pieces of asphalt between 20 and 50 cm bs. All of these shovel tests showed
evidence that the soil had been disturbed as undisturbed matrix was not encountered until 60 cm
or below. Materials from this scatter, which appears to contain both recent highway trash (e.g.,
brown bottle glass, aluminum can, styrofoam) as well as the construction debris (brick including
one white brick marked “A.P. GREEN F.B…”/”STANDARD” and dates post 1956 [Gurcke
1987]) that may have been dumped at some time in the past, were also evident in the adjacent
plowed field (Figure 4). These observations indicate that the admixture of buried construction
debris and modern cultural material represents a discreet dumping episode intermingled with
every-day highway trash and has been scattered along the ROW due to mowing, ROW and
highway maintenance, and/or any utilities that might be found at the edge of the ROW as well as
plowing in the adjacent field. This scatter does not contain any intact context or integrity, nor are
the materials of an age or significance that would warrant the designation of an official site
trinomial, and is therefore not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or designation as an SAL.

The same stratigraphic sequence was observed throughout the segment, indicating the entire area
has been adversely impacted. It was also observed at the time of survey that the construction
presently occurring along U.S. 283 has intruded into the project area along the east side of U.S.
283 south of FM 925 (Figure 5).

Survey Area: Segment B
This segment began at CR 2072 and extended southward to the northern side of the Pease River.
The latest soil data (USDA 2007) indicates the entire section is composed of Rough broken land,
which is essentially a miscellaneous category indicating disturbance. It was clear from the
inspection that this segment has been impacted by road construction, dumping, and/or mining
activities.
Part of this disturbance includes a series of fill episodes extending from the edge of the uplands
into the Pease River valley that has created a flattened artificial extension of the uplands on both
sides of U.S. 283 (Figure 6). The central portion of this slope to the river within the ROW has
been extensively scraped and reshaped by road construction activities (Figure 7). Three
judgmental shovel tests excavated along a rise in this portion of the segment confirmed that the
area has been previously impacted (see Figure 2). The portion of this segment closest to the
Pease River has been impacted by mining (Figure 8) and bridge construction (Figure 9).

Survey Area: Segment C
This segment of the project area began on the southern side of the Pease River and extended
southward to the vicinity of a two-track road that intersects U.S. 283 from both the west and the
east. A new Pease River bridge is proposed for this location west of the existing bridge. Although
right-of-entry (ROE) was granted prior to visiting the area, there was some initial difficulty
identifying and contacting the present landowner, Dr. Joel Lowry; however, as a result of the
contacts and personal influence of our backhoe operator, Gene Evans, contact was made and
permission to access the property was granted. A total of seven trenches was excavated within
the proposed location for the replacement of the Pease River bridge. No cultural material or
buried soils were observed during the excavations of these trenches. A summary of each trench
included a generalized discussion of the soils and photographs of the trench profiles are presented
in this section. Due to excessive rainfall prior to the survey, the local water table of the APE was
extremely high and affected the integrity of the trenches, which was a prime safety concern.
Trench 1: The trench was the most northern trench excavated on the south side of the Pease
River. It was placed just to the south of Dr. Lowry’s northern boundary fence. The trench was
roughly 80 cm wide, 4.2 m long, and orientated 30 degrees east of magnetic north. The
stratigraphic profile (Figure 10) conforms to the latest soil data that reports this location as being
composed of Riverwash soils (USDA 2007).

Trench 2: The trench was placed on the southern edge of the open section roughly 60 m south of
Trench 1 (Figure 11). This trench mirrored the stratigraphic profile observed in Trench 1 in that
banded sands representing modern alluvial deposits overlie sandy clay-rich macro and micro
bands (Figure 12). This falls in alignment with the latest soil data that reports this location as
being composed of Riverwash soils parallel to U.S. 283 (USDA 2007). The trench was roughly

Trench 3: The trench was placed roughly 60 m south of Trench 2 in a location of thicker
vegetation than either of the previous trenches (Figure 13). During excavation of this trench, a
large, steel, woven cable was encountered (Figure 14). The reports provided by Digtess and
Texas One Call for this area failed to indicate the presence of any buried utilities in this location.
Once inspected and evaluated by GMI archeologists, it was determined that this cable was part of
the construction debris left over from the initial construction of the Pease River bridge. The
trench was widened to the east for the purpose of continuing with the archeological
investigations, but the disturbance associated with the buried cable was still present. The
continuation of excavations encountered the localized water table at roughly 1.9 m below the
surface (bs), at which point the walls of the trench began to collapse and excavation ceased
(Figure 15). The trench measured roughly 80 cm wide, 4 m long, and was orientated 30 degrees
east of magnetic north or parallel to U.S. 283.

Trench 4: The trench was placed roughly 60 m south of Trench 3 and located closer to the

The trench was stratigraphically different from any of the previously excavated trenches (Figure

(USDA 2007), but there was no indication of any buried soil. The localized water table was
located at about 1.8 m bs at the interface of the sandy clay and the larger-sized granular gray
sands. The trench measured roughly 1.6 m wide, 4 m long, and was orientated 30 degrees east of

Trench 6: The trench was placed roughly 60 m south of Trench 5 and similarly positioned closer
to the western border of the ROW. The stratigraphic sequence observed in this trench was closely
related to that observed in the previous trench (Figure 19), but the sands were less consolidated
with larger-grained sands and a more shallow localized water table at 1.5 m bs. The trench was
roughly 1.6 m wide, 4 m long, and orientated 30 degrees east of magnetic north or parallel to U.S.

about 1.9 m bs as the reddish gray sands were completely saturated and collapsed shortly after
exposure. The trench was roughly 1.6 m wide, 4 m long, and orientated 30 degrees east of
magnetic north or parallel to U.S. 283.

In summary, the results of the archeological trenching within the location for the proposed
replacement of the Pease River bridge indicated the presence of deep deposits of modern
alluvium overlying earlier alluvial deposits with no evidence of a buried soil. The localized water
table appears to conform to the lowest stratigraphic unit represented by the reddish gray sands
and is generally 1.5 to 2 m bs. It should also be noted that the disturbance observed in Trench 3
is a linear disturbance that likely runs through the entire proposed location for the new Pease
River bridge. Based on these observations, it is concluded there are no buried soils or cultural
resources within this location.

Survey Area: Segment D
Segment D consisted of the section of U.S. 283 extending southward from the Lowry property to
the northern boundary of the urban development associated with the city of Vernon (see Figure
2). This segment contained two separately proposed U.S. 283 relief structure replacements,
which were originally slated to be tested using archeological trenching. Upon inspection of the
conditions of the project area at the time of the survey, it was evident these two locations could
not be tested using such a strategy because of standing water (Figures 22 and 23). Consequently,
two shovel tests were excavated on the west side of U.S. 283 adjacent to these relief
replacements; neither indicated the presence of a buried soil or recovered cultural materials. The
area on the east side of U.S. 283 near these proposed relief replacements was likewise either
underwater or dominated by a large disposal area (Figure 24).
The remaining southern portion of this segment was not shovel tested but photodocumented
because it has been impacted by agricultural activities as evident from pushpiles west of the
ROW (Figure 25) and the construction and eventual abandonment of large, equipment storage
structures. This area has been further impacted by the construction of gas pipelines (Figure 26)
and the construction of additional and subsequently abandoned structures such as an old gas
station (Figure 27). The prospect of intact archeological deposits was considered low due to the
lack of artifacts around this structure and the extent of the impacts to the ROW from mowing,
maintenance, and the encroachment of agricultural activities and impacts on the structure and its
surrounding yard preempted the use of shovel testing at this location.

Survey Area: Segment E
Segment E consisted of the southernmost portion of the project area and included all of the urban
development associated with the city of Vernon (see Figure 2). This entire section has been
adversely impacted by a combination of construction of road and rail, grain stores, warehouses,
gas stations, and utilities (Figure 28 and 29). No shovel tests were excavated in this segment, but
the segment was photodocumented.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The archeological survey of the 2.2 miles of the U.S. 283 proposed road improvement project
north of Vernon was designed to investigate the project area for previously undocumented
archeological resources, reassess any previously recorded archeological sites within the project
area, and collect sufficient data for the evaluation of the eligibility of each property for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places and for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. Though no archeological sites or no historic-era sites were identified during this
survey, one scatter of recent highway trash and construction debris was identified in two shovel
tests at the northern end of the project area. All archeological resources identified were evaluated
for NRHP and SAL inclusion under the following criteria.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

Eligibility for Inclusion in the NRHP
In order to become a “historic property” eligible for listing in the NRHP (36 CFR 800.2), cultural
resources are evaluated according to criteria based on federal regulations for determining the
significance outlined in 36 CFR 60.4.
“Historic property” means any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object
included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register. This term includes . . . artifacts, records,
and remains that are related to and located within such properties. The term “eligible for inclusion in
the National Register” includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the
Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria [36 CFR 800.2].

Subsequent to identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions
associated with cultural resources, the following NRHP eligibility criteria are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:

49

(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR 60.4].

Eligibility for Inclusion in the SAL Program
At the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
2. The archeological site is situated on private land which has been specifically designated as an SAL
. . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

RECOMMENDATIONS
The entire project area consisted of existing right-of-way that had never been previously
surveyed. This archeological survey used a combination of systematic and judgmental shovel
tests and archeological trenches to test the project area. No archeological sites were found during
the survey, however, a scatter of recent highway trash and construction debris was identified in
two shovel test units and in an adjacent plowed field at the north end of the project area. This
scatter does not contain any intact context or integrity, nor are the materials of an age or
significance that would warrant the designation of an official site trinomial, and is therefore not
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or designation as an SAL. Though an abandoned gas station
was observed in the ROW near the southern end of the project area, the prospect of intact
archeological deposits was considered low due to the extent of the impacts to the ROW from
mowing, maintenance, and the encroachment of agricultural activities on the structure and its
surrounding yard. Additionally, review of historic maps showed no potential for historic-era sites
within the project corridor. Therefore, as no archeological historic properties (36 CRF 800.16.1)
or State Archeological Landmarks (13 TAC 26.12) occur within the APE, no such properties
would be affected by the undertaking, and no additional investigations are warranted.
