ABSTRACT

CDS/Muery Services, contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), to conduct archeological survey
for the proposed San Antonio Water System (SAWS) Old Salado Siphon replacement pipeline in
San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The rehabilitation pipeline runs along Old Corpus Christi
Road from SE Military Parkway to Henderson Court, where it angles to the southwest crossing
South Presa Street, the San Antonio River, Stinson Municipal Airport, Six Mile Creek, and
ending at the Rilling Road flow transfer station on Rilling Road along the existing pipeline. The
line is 1.95 miles long with a 35-foot-wide easement except at the San Antonio River where the
easement is 65-foot wide and a Temporary Use Agreement for 100 feet is being negotiated. Sliplining, open-cut, and boring methods will be utilized for the installation of the pipe. Shovel tests
were excavated at the pull pit areas and the open-cut area at Rilling Road. One geotechnical core
at the San Antonio River was analyzed for buried site potential.
The results of the survey indicated that the Old Salado Siphon corridor is highly disturbed and no
new sites or deposits were identified as a result of this fieldwork. Analysis of the core sample
indicated that the floodplain in this area is disturbed down to 16 feet, and that sediments below 16
feet are comprised of natural alluvium and river channel deposits to a depth of at least 40 feet.
No historic properties would be affected by the installation of the new pipe. At the conclusion of
this project, all files concerning this project will be permanently housed at the Center for
Archaeological Research, University of Texas at San Antonio. The project was conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit # 4930 and National Parks Service Scientific Research and Collection
Permit No. SAAN-2008-SCI-0002.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

San Antonio Water System has proposed slip-lining the sewer pipe known as the Old Salado
Siphon in south San Antonio, Bexar County (Figure 1), and contracted with CDS/Muery to
conduct the engineering and environmental services. Geo-Marine, Inc., was contracted by
CDS/Muery to conduct the archeological survey as part of the environmental assessment for the
project (GMI Project # 30209.01.03). The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this
project area is to determine the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate
identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas. The
project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit # 4930 and National Parks Service
Scientific Research and Collection Permit No. SAAN-2008-SCI-0002. The archeological survey
project was conducted in two phases: a detailed literature review (Bastis 2007) and the
subsequent fieldwork. This report covers only the fieldwork phase.
The archeological investigation involved intensive survey of selective areas along the pipe
replacement route. The replacement pipeline corridor runs along Old Corpus Christi Road from
Southeast Military Drive to Henderson Court, where it angles to the southwest at about a 30
degree angle crossing South Presa Street, the San Antonio River, Stinson Municipal Airport, Six
Mile Creek, and ending at the flow transfer station on Rilling Road along the existing pipeline.
the corridor crosses San Antonio River Authority (SARA) and national park properties, a railroad
right-of-way, and several privately owned properties. The San Antonio River in this area of San
Antonio has been totally modified and rechannelized by dredging, filling, bank stabilization,
damming, and flood control measures. It flows in a southward direction at the point where the
siphon will be placed. Six Mile Creek, at the siphon crossing, flows in an eastward direction just
before it flows into the channelized portion at its convergence with the San Antonio River,
approximately .5 mile away. The project area consists of the Old Salado Siphon permanent
easement of 35 feet (ft) wide, which widens to 65 ft at the river, and 10,290 ft (approximately
1.95 miles [mi]) long. A joint-use agreement is being negotiated between SAWS and the
Aviation group of the City of San Antonio for the portion crossing Stinson Airport, as is a
temporary use agreement between SAWS and National Park Service and San Antonio River
Authority to allow construction of the planned south riverbank lines deepening relocation. Most
of the pipe will be slip-lined, though some open-cutting will be necessary and approximately
1

200 ft of the San Antonio River will be bored. The construction right-of-way would be confined
to the 35-ft-wide easement for the most part, but at the San Antonio River, a temporary easement
of 100 ft will be necessary. Open-cutting will occur at four areas along the easement: (1) in the
street along Old Corpus Christi Road from Southeast Military Drive to Henderson Court; (2)
across a portion of the San Antonio River eastern and western banks; and (3) about 950 ft from
Rilling Road at the terminus of this project.
Principal Investigator Melissa Green and Staff Archeologist Steven Hunt conducted the fieldwork
from June 24â27, 2008. The results of this phase of work are presented in the following report.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

TOPOLOGY AND PHYSIOGRAPHY
The Balcones Escarpment, a broad area of faulted limestone that forms the southern and eastern
edge of the Edwards Plateau, primarily governs the regional physiography. The escarpment rises
approximately 1,000 feet above the coastal prairie that lies to the south and east, and has a
marked influence on the environmental setting. It extends from near Del Rio, Texas, about 160
miles to the west, through northern Bexar County, to Austin (70 miles to the northeast).
Remnants of the escarpment extend as far north as Waco. This physical feature runs northeast to
southwest through the San Antonio area and is west of the immediate project area.
The Edwards Plateau, a rugged hilly region dissected by many small streams, lies to the
northwest of the escarpment. Within the San Antonio region, the Edwards Plateau is drained by
Cibolo and Balcones creeks and contains the headwaters of Culebra, Leon, and Salado creeks
(Taylor et al. 1991:119). Plateau elevations range from 1,100 feet to 1,900 feet. Fenneman
(1931) mapped the Edwards Plateau as part of the Great Plains Province.
The Gulf Coastal Plain (also called the Rio Grand Plain) Province lies southeast of the Balcones
Escarpment. It consists of nearly level or undulating prairie, and elevations range from 450 feet
to 700 feet. The Medina and San Antonio rivers, Cibolo Creek, and their tributaries drain the
province (Taylor et al. 1991:119).
The Blackland Prairie physiographic area falls along the base of the escarpment and encompasses
the current project area (Taylor et al. 1991). The Blackland Prairie is undulating and hilly, with
elevations ranging from 700 feet to 1,000 feet. Within the San Antonio region, the Blackland
Prairie is drained by the San Antonio River and by tributaries of the Medina River and Cibolo
Creek (Taylor et al. 1991:119). This physiographic area is also known as part of the
Taylor/Navarro Plain. Much of this plain is covered with gravelly terrace deposits, and some
valleys are cut by stream erosion.

HYDROLOGY
The hydrology of the region is derived from subsurface aquifers and from surface drainages that
emanate from the Balcones Escarpment. The Comanche Peak, Edwards, and Georgetown
Limestone formations comprise a hydrologic unit known as the Edwards Underground Reservoir
or Edwards Aquifer. This aquifer extends along the Balcones Fault Zone from Kinney County
through Uvalde, Medina, Bexar, and Comal counties and terminates in Hays County. Seventeen
cities, including San Antonio, and local communities depend on the Edwards Aquifer for their
domestic water supply. The formations on the Edwards Plateau form an extensive perched water
table, from which the residents derive water. In places where the Edwards Plateau outcrops to the
south, numerous springs and seeps occur and form the base flow for several of the perennial
streams in the area. The location of these springs and seeps influenced both prehistoric and
historic settlement patterns in the area (Gerstle et al. 1978:26). In the area below the escarpment,
where the Edwards Plateau outcrops, water reenters the formation through solution cavities that
have developed along fractures in the limestone. Recharge to the aquifer is primarily from
streams that flow across its outcrop in the Fault Zone, although some recharge is from direct
precipitation on the outcrop.
At various places downslope from the recharge zones, water reaches the surface under hydraulic
pressure through faults that reach the surface. These water sources have formed springs and
artesian wells. Hill and Vaughn (1898) listed 40 artesian wells in San Antonio. Six major
springs, as well as countless other small springs and seeps, are present in Bexar County.
BEDROCK GEOLOGY
The project is located in southern Bexar County near the southeastern edge of the Balcones
Escarpment. Geologic units at the north end of the project area along Old Corpus Christi Road
are Tertiary Wilcox and Midway Groups, and the remainder of the project area is found on
Quaternary (Holocene) Fluviatile terrace deposits and Alluvium (Bureau of Economic Geology
1983). The Wilcox Group is mostly mudstone with varying amounts of sandstone and lignite,
and the Midway Group is clay and sand (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983). Fluviatile terrace
deposits are composed of gravel, sand, silt, and clay, and Alluvium deposits of floodplain
depositions (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983).
SOILS
The soil association mapped for this area is the Venus-Frio-Trinity association made up of deep
calcareous soils on bottom lands and terraces (Taylor et al. 1991). Five specific soils are mapped
along the corridor: Lewisville silty clay, Patrick soils, Frio clay loam, Hilly Gravely Land, and
Pits and Quarries. Lewisville silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, are found on long, narrow sloping
areas that separate nearly level terraces from soils on the uplands; this soil is found along Old
Corpus Christi Road on the north end of the line. The profile consists of a surface level that is
dark grayish brown and about 50.8 centimeters (cm; 20 inches [in]) thick followed by a firm but
crumbly-when-moist limy brown clay that is about 43.2 cm (17 in) thick.. Lewisville silty clay, 0
to 1 percent slopes, is found on nearly level, broad terraces along rivers and creeks and is mapped
along Rilling Road on the south end of the corridor. This soil profile is brown silty clay or light
clay for about 60.9 cm (24 in). The subsurface is also a very firm but crumbly-when-moist brown
silty clay that is 50.8 cm (20 in) thick. It also contains a few worm casts and hard and soft lime
concretions (Taylor et al. 1991).
6

Patrick soils, 3 to 5 percent slopes, occupy escarpments between first- and second-level terraces
above floodplains of streams that drain the limestone prairies. This soil is also found along Old
Corpus Christi Road. The soil profile begins at the surface with clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or
loam that is 25.4 cm (10 in) thick followed by a clay loam or loam that is granular in structure.
Frio clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, is mapped along the San Antonio River floodplain and is
limy throughout. The surface layer is about 50.8 cm (20 in) thick and overlays a light brownish
gray layer that is only about 12.7 cm (5 in) thick. For about 63.5â76.2 cm (25â30 in) below this
shallow layer is a layer with a texture range of between sandy loam through stratified loam to
clay loam. The depth of well-rounded limestone gravel ranges from 0.9 meters (m) to 1.8 m (3 to
6 ft) or more (Taylor et al. 1991).
Hilly Gravelly Land occurs on knolls and narrow ridges that appear to be erosion-resistant
remnants of old waterways and is mapped at the southeast corner of Stinson Airport. These soils
consist of beds of caliche or of gravelly, very strongly calcareous, loamy alluvium 3 to 6 m (10 to
20 ft) or more thick. The upper 7.6 to 30.4 cm (3 to 12 in) is a hard and platy caliche level.
Areas mapped as Pits and Quarries consist of gravel pits, clay pits, sand pits, limestone quarries,
chalk quarries, rock quarries, and sanitary landfills (Taylor et al. 1991). The soil type primarily
used for pits and quarries consists of a 0.6â0.9-m (2â3-ft) bed of weak conglomerate of sediments
cemented with calcium carbonates. A large area just off the east side of the Stinson Airport
runways was used in the late 1950s and early 1960s for soil quarrying during the original
channelization efforts along the San Antonio River, but has been since reclaimed and is now
covered in mowed grasses.

FLORA AND FAUNA
Bexar County is situated in a transitional zone between three physiographic regions, and the flora
is therefore a mixture of three biotic provinces: the Balconian (associated with the Edwards
Plateau), the Tamaulipan (associated with the South Texas Coastal Plain), and primarily the
Texan (associated with the Blackland Prairie). Each is represented to varying degrees (Blair
1950).
Because of this transitional setting, the indigenous native vegetation was likely quite diverse and
abundant. Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), and panic
grass (Panicum sp.) are considered the dominant climax species, but other grasses such as big
bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), Indian grass (Sorghastrum avenaceum), switchgrass (Panicum
virgatum), and side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) are also found. Along waterways are
woodlands of cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), cottonwood
(Populus deltoides), and pecan (Carya illinoinensis) trees. Vegetation inventories within the
nearby San Antonio Missions National Historical Park have documented the tendency for
huisache (Acacia smallii), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and Texas sugarberry (Celtis
laevigata) to colonize and replace grasslands and abandoned farms (Cooper et al. 2005). The
indigenous native prairie supported herds of buffalo (Bison bison), antelope (Antilocapra
americana), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), peccary (Pecar tajacu), and numerous
game birds. The urbanization of the area has caused most of the larger and more sensitive
animals to vacate.

7

The present fauna can be divided into two regimes: those inhabiting the urban area and those
inhabiting the bottomlands. Urban-tolerant animal and bird species include the fox squirrel
(Sciurus niger), English sparrow (Passer domesticus), rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus),
grackle (Quiscalus spp.), mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), robin (Turdus migratorius), and
chickadee (Poecile spp.). The bottomlands form a more protected habitat for wilder species.
Beaver (Castor canadensis), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), skunk (Mephitis mephitis),
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.), javelina or collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu), feral pig (Sus
scrofa), and opossum (Didelphis virginiana) inhabit the bottomlands. The number of bird species
that visit bottomlands also may be high, as a large number of birds have been sighted in Bexar
County. Black bullheads (Ictalurus melas), mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), sailfin molly
(Poecillia latipinna), warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth
bass (Micropterus salmoides), Rio Grande perch (Cichlasoma cyanoguttatum), as well as
introduced species of mouthbrooders, may inhabit the wetlands.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGY (10,000 B.C.âA.D. 1500s)
The project area falls within the southern portion of the Central Texas archeological region. The
archeological record for Central Texas reflects the full North American cultural sequence;
therefore, evidence of human occupation spans a time period of roughly 12,000 years. The
Central Texas cultural sequence presented in the following discussion is divided into regionspecific cultural-historical periods within four broad cultural stagesâPaleo-Indian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historicâthat differentiate the broadly recognized North American cultural
trends (Table 1). These four major cultural stages are briefly summarized in the following
cultural history of the Central Texas area, which derives primarily from the work of Black (1989),
Hester (2004), Prewitt (1981, 1985), Suhm (1960), Suhm et al. (1954), and Weir (1976).

Paleo-Indian
The earliest widely accepted human occupation of North America is termed the Paleo-Indian
stage (10,000â6000 B.C.). Cooler, wetter conditions were in place 12,000 years ago, and
although a general drying trend continued through Paleo-Indian times, climatic conditions were
more stable than during the subsequent Holocene. This period is often characterized as a culture
of small but highly mobile bands of foragers who were specialized hunters of Pleistocene
megafauna. Most Paleo-Indian sites are deeply buried and difficult to find, leaving the highly
visible, but often fortuitously discovered, mammoth kill sites as the primary evidence of PaleoIndian life-ways. Recent studies address this bias and emphasize that large kills probably
contributed little to overall food requirements. Rather, a primary reliance on other game animals
and plant resources was more likely (Ferring 1989). Subsistence in this period certainly included
large herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but was probably based more consistently
on smaller animals such as various species of turtle, land tortoise, alligator, mice, badger, and
raccoon (Collins et al. 1989; Story 1990) and, presumably, also included an array of plants
(Collins 1998). The defining Paleo-Indian trait is the fluted point tradition. Projectile points of
the earliest Paleo-Indian period were made from high quality toolstone and indicate high
technical skill in flaking, exhibiting a hallmark âflute,â which is a long, shallow flake scar that
extends from the base toward the tip of the point on one or both sides.
The Paleo-Indian stage in Texas, as across North America, is the earliest substantiated cultural
period. The Paleo-Indian stage in Central Texas falls into early and late subperiods, which
encompass three archeological complexes. The Llano and Folsom complexes comprise the Early
Paleo-Indian subperiod (10,000â8000 B.C.), and the Plano complex reflects the Late Paleo-Indian
subperiod (8000â6000 B.C.). These complexes are not unique to Central Texas, for their ranges
extended into the Southwest and Great Plains. The Early Paleo-Indian subperiod is based on two
projectile point styles: Clovis and Folsom.
The Llano complex is represented by the Clovis projectile point, the oldest point type found in
North America. Much research energy has been devoted to the makers of Clovis points, but the
material record of Llano peoples is largely limited to hunting activities. Clovis assemblages
include the diagnostic fluted lanceolate Clovis point, along with engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, and ochre (Collins 1995; Collins et al. 1992). Sites with Clovis components
reported in Central Texas include Kincaid Rockshelter (Uvalde County), Wilson-Leonard and
Crockett Gardens (Williamson County), Gault (Bell County), Horn Shelter 2 (Bosque County),
and Pavo Real (Bexar County). Surface finds of distinctive Clovis points are reported from a
number of other localities (Meltzer and Bever 1995).
By about 11,000 years ago the cool, wet climatic conditions of the Pleistocene had given way to
Holocene warming and drying. This change coincides with the extinction of Pleistocene
megafauna, most notably the mammoth, and is concurrent with the earliest record of the Folsom
complex. Like the Llano complex, the Folsom complex is best known for the Folsom projectile
point. Shorter than Clovis points, âclassicâ Folsom points exhibit fine parallel flaking and large
flutes that extend across most of each face. Midland points, commonly believed to occur later in
time, may represent unfluted Folsom points, apparently made to offset the production risks
involved in fluting (Amick 1995). Another trademark of the Folsom complex is the association
of Folsom points with the remains of now-extinct bison (Bison antiquus), usually found in the
context of massive kills of bison herds run into ravines. Such sites are conspicuous, and thus
much of what is known about Folsom subsistence and technology comes from lithic artifacts
10

found at these sites or nearby processing sites. Folsom tool kits consisted of the fluted Folsom
and the thin, unfluted (Midland) points, large thin bifaces, and end scrapers that were more
conducive to specialized hunting, particularly of Bison antiquus (Collins 1995:382).
By approximately 10,000 years ago, the climate trended toward more moderate conditions, and
megafauna from the Early Paleo-Indian subperiod were no longer available. Most of the
associated faunal evidence dated to the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex reflects a human
subsistence pattern based on deer and other smaller animals. Horn Shelter No. 2 (Forrester 1985)
located on the Brazos River in Bosque County, Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977) in Val
Verde County, and Wilson-Leonard (Collins 1998) in Williamson County have yielded
subsistence data indicating that a variety of vertebrate fauna was consumed by the Late PaleoIndian peoples.
The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex is represented by a greater diversity of projectile points
(e.g., Plainview, Angostura, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina), which, still in lanceolate form, were
unfluted. In contrast to evidence from the earlier subperiod, late subperiod points are associated
with modern bison (Bison bison) and often occur as surface finds throughout Central Texas. The
beginning of Prewittâs (1981) Early Archaic, or Circleville phase, is considered in this report as
the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex, but it has also been called the âPre-Archaicâ (see
Sollberger and Hester 1972). The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex defies convenient labeling,
as it exhibits a unique blend of lanceolate and stemmed points that appear to correspond with lifeways reflective of Archaic subsistence alongside Paleo-Indian mobility. Again, little is known
about the complex in Central Texas, but toward the latter part of the Late Paleo-Indian period,
lanceolate points began to be replaced by stemmed points. Settlement-subsistence strategies
probably more closely approximated those of the Archaic than Early Paleo-Indian. More diverse
sites are associated with this period, including not only the mass bison kills, which by the Late
Paleo-Indian period consist only of modern bison (Bison bison), but also campsites and
residences. The characteristics of the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Maryâs Hall
components are more Archaic-like in that burned rock features are found, although the features
are much smaller and contain less rock that the burned rock features in the subsequent Archaic.

Toward the end of the Late Paleo-Indian period a great variety of projectile point styles began to
appear. The subsequent Archaic period (6000 B.C.âA.D. 700) is broadly characterized by
stemmed and side-notched dart points and by the appearance of ground and pecked stone tools.
The Archaic represents a more generalized style of hunting and gathering as a way of life, and the
subsistence pattern may have become more diffuse, reflecting a greater exploitation of local
environments as smaller game animals, fish, and wild plant foods increased in dietary importance.
Like their predecessors, Archaic peoples apparently continued to follow a nomadic way of life,
traveling seasonally to utilize different food resources in various localities (cf. Weir 1976).
McGraw and Hindes (1987:47) have noted that:
In northern and central Bexar County, major occupation sites are situated on stream terraces and are
usually associated with one or a series of spatially proximate, often buried, burned rock middens. An
extensive distribution of chipped stone debitage and a variety of diagnostic projectile points indicate
recurring occupations that span several thousand years. Major Late Prehistoric sites, in contrast, are
often physically discrete from these earlier sites.

11

The Archaic is generally divided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods (Black 1989; Collins
1995; Story 1985) based on diagnostic projectile point styles and associated radiocarbon assays
(Collins 1995). By the Middle Archaic in southern Central Texas, some regional distinctiveness
is apparent archeologically, as evidenced primarily by increased techno-stylistic diversity among
projectile point types. Interplay between influential factors of population increase and
environmental change toward greater aridity and climatic variability probably drove adaptive
change throughout the Archaic. The following discussion follows Storyâs (1985) broader
subdivisions of the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic, although Prewittâs (1981) discussion of
various phases within these periods provides much of the information discussed.
The most archeologically obvious changes from the Paleo-Indian to the Early Archaic (6000â
2500 B.C.) are the appearance of ground stone implements and the shift from the lanceolate points
of the Paleo-Indian tradition to the stemmed and side-notched dart points emblematic of the
Archaic. Three recognized point styles (Angostura, Early Split Stem [Gower and Jetta], and
Martindale-Uvalde) indicate that the makers tended to occupy the better-watered eastern part of
the Edwards Plateau (Collins 1998:65). Assemblages also include Clear Fork and Guadalupe
bifaces, manos, metates, hammerstones, burins, circular scrapers, and a variety of bifaces. Few
burials have been assigned to this period (Prewitt 1981:77â79; Story 1985:34â35), and
settlement/subsistence systems are âhypothesized to have been diffuse, utilizing a variety of
resources and frequently shifting the loci of subsistence activities rather than intensifying the use
of any specified resourceâ (Story 1985:39).
Projectile point types constitute the primary source of information about the Early Archaic, but
Prewitt (1981, 1985) uses point types to define four phases: the Circleville, San Geronimo,
Jarrell, and Oakalla, respectively. This refinement is questioned by some as unsubstantiated since
few intact sites are known (see Black 1989:26; Black and McGraw 1985), but the tendency for
many Early Archaic sites to occur around the Balcones Escarpment leads several researchers to
infer that this area was a refuge from drier conditions in Central Texas and on the coastal plains
(McKinney 1981; Story 1985). Concentrations of Early Archaic sites along the southern and
eastern margins of the Edwards Plateau may be indicative of climatic conditions at the time, as
these environments had more reliable water sources and a diverse subsistence base. The margins
of the Edwards Plateau are ecotonal in character and may have provided reliable resources during
times of environmental stress (Story 1985:31, 34). Convincing paleoenvironmental data on the
climatic conditions of this period is, nonetheless, still lacking.
Early Archaic sites are small (Weir 1976:115â122), suggesting that populations were highly
mobile and that their densities were low (Prewitt 1985:217). Early Archaic sites are usually
described as open campsites (such as Loeve [Williamson County], Wilson-Leonard, Richard
Beene [Bexar County], Sleeper [Blanco County], Jetta Court [Travis County], Youngsport and
Landslide [Bell County], Camp Pearl Wheat [Kerr County]) or lithic procurement stations. Only
a few campsites located in rockshelters (e.g., Kincaid Rockshelter) occur on the Edwards Plateau
during this period. The location of lithic procurement sites is determined by the natural
distribution of cherts. Large and varied burned-rock features (Sleeper, Camp Pearl Wheat,
Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene) become common in the latter part of the Early Archaic, and
domestic structures (Turkey Bend Ranch) and caches (Linder) are also known in the Early
Archaic (Collins 1998:64). Freshwater mussel, deer, and small game appear to have been
important food resources. Hearths are occasionally found at Early Archaic sites and can be stonelined, basin-shaped, or flat. The appearance of ground stone signifies a shift to plant resources,
and the diversification of lithic technology appears to reflect an increased reliance on gathering.
12

The Middle Archaic (2500â400 B.C.) marks the first period of Central Texas distinctiveness as an
archeological region. The subperiod exhibits more numerous and more varied sites than the
preceding Early Archaic. This cultural manifestation is characterized by a population increase;
the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns; and changes in settlement patterns,
economic and social systems, and technology (Prewitt 1985). In addition, territorial boundaries
may have begun to emerge (Story 1985:39).
Burned-rock middens, which often consist of massive amounts of fire-cracked limestone, are,
however, the preeminent archeological features of the Middle Archaic. Many of these middens
may represent earthen ovens used to process live oak acorns (see Weir 1976), as well as for
roasting succulents or other plants and animals. Many Central Texas tree species disappeared
from the paleoenvironmental record at this time, leaving live oak forests to dominate the
landscape. A renewed focus on deer, which themselves were well suited for the oak-savanna
environment, is likely. Weir (1976:124â130) suggests that an expansion of oak forests influenced
the development of an economic system that focused on the exploitation of deer, acorns, and
other hardwood nuts. Prewitt (1985:222â226) notes that the abundance of rock middens indicates
a greater reliance on plant foods, although tool kits still imply a strong reliance on hunting.
Middle Archaic sites in Central Texas are represented by rockshelters, campsites, lithic quarries,
and kill sites (Weir 1976), as well as by the burned-rock middens that first appeared toward the
end of the Early Archaic. Other features include basin hearths and large flat hearths. Data
concerning mortuary practices are few except for the end of the Middle Archaic, for which
cremations have been reported (Prewitt 1981:81). Three generalized point styles characterize this
subperiod: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis. Bifaces, a variety of scrapers,
unifaces, and grinding stones are also present. Prewitt (1981:73) suggests that the proportion of
projectile points (50 percent) compared to total number of tools is indicative of a balance between
the exploitation of plant and animal resources.
Late Archaic (400 B.C.âA.D. 700.) life-ways began similarly to those of the Middle Archaic, but
notable changes occurred, characterized by the emergence of new cultural patterns as well as the
intensification of preexisting ones (Story 1985:45). Coastal marine shells, used either as
ornaments or as raw materials for ornaments, were exchanged with inland groups, at least on a
limited basis, in return for finished lithic tools and/or siliceous raw material (Story 1985:48). The
use of burned-rock middens throughout the Late Archaic appears to have been a major part of the
subsistence strategy as a decrease in the importance of hunting, inferred from the low ratio of
projectile points in relation to other tools in site assemblages, may have occurred (Prewitt
1981:74). Bison, which had been absent from the area for most of the Archaic, however, were
once again available in the region (Dillehay 1974).
Late Archaic sites include rockshelters, campsites, and large cemeteries. The establishment of
these large cemeteries along drainages suggests strong territorial ties by certain groups (Story
1985:40). Cemeteries, burial sites where at least two individuals were buried in proximity, imply
repeated use of space for the burial of a group of peopleâs dead. The location and use of the
larger cemeteries are believed to be the result of the same cultural group using a place on the
landscape to reaffirm their rights of descent and control/access to critical resources (see
discussion in Taylor 1998 and Taylor et al. 1995:627â631).

13

Late Archaic cemeteries in South and Central Texas exhibit a significant energy investment and
often contain mortuary furniture. When artifacts are found in burial contexts, they represent
discrete points in time, or part of the package of tools or objects that would have been used during
a particular occupation period. Burial artifacts, then, provide the unique opportunity to glimpse
an assemblage that may not be possible in other site contexts where multiple occupations may be
overprinted, as is common in terrace settings. From general ethnographic studies of huntergatherer groups, it is suspected that grave goods represent a sampling of utilitarian and
ornamental items used and possessed in life by those individuals, hinting at the social status and
personae of the deceased (Binford 1971), and a recognition that such burial goods would be
needed in the deceasedâs next life (Perttula 2001).
In Central Texas, on the Edwards Plateau, burials in sinkholes and caves appear to be relatively
common (Kibler 2001). Below the escarpment, however, cemeteries are found along river
drainages and often contain mortuary goods. There appears to be an association of deer antler
and deer antler racks in late Middle Archaic and Late Archaic mortuary contexts. Evidence of
this association is primarily based on items recovered from large burials in riverine settings at
such sites as Loma Sandia (41LK28) in Live Oak County, Olmos Dam (41BX1) in the Blackland
Prairie below the Edwards Plateau escarpment in Bexar County, and Ernest Witte (41AU36)
along the lower Brazos River in Austin County (Perttula 2001).
More than 200 burials were interred in the large cemetery at Loma Sandia (Live Oak County)
between 850 and 550 B.C., during the latter part of the Middle Archaic period (Taylor and
Highley 1995). Loma Sandia burial goods contained the functional tool forms that a
hunter/gatherer would need on a day-to-day basis. Analysis of the burials at this site revealed
some disparity between grave goods associated with males and those associated with females. At
this site, males exclusively had thin bifaces, unifaces, antler racks, and modified mussel shells,
but women were found with shark teeth, asphaltum, and certain dart points (Morhiss, Abasolo,
and Pedernales) (Lukowski 1988).
Many of these mortuary items provide evidence of interaction between the occupants of the site
and groups from the Gulf Coast and Central Texas (Taylor and Highley 1995). The presence of
marine shell, shark teeth, and Morhiss dart points indicates that the groups at Loma Sandia had
extensive contact with coastal groups or visited the coast themselves (a distance of only 60â70
miles). Asphaltum residue was found on the stems of the dart points recovered at this site.
Asphaltum was used as a hafting adhesive and would have been obtained as balls that wash up on
the beach shore along the coastline. Stone tools made of high-quality Edwards chert probably
also represent trade items.
At Olmos Dam (41BX1), a Late Archaic cemetery in Bexar County, the majority of the
individuals had associated grave goods (Lukowski 1988). Included were freshwater and marine
shell ornaments, red ochre, bone artifacts, and stone artifacts; especially numerous were antlers
and antler racks. Many of the burials in this cemetery were lying in a flexed position. Some of
the burials at the Olmos Dam site displayed evidence of violence, including a small dart point
(possibly a Godley or a Palmillas) found within the skull of an adult male (Lukowski 1988). At
Olmos Dam, unlike Loma Sandia, antler racks also covered the graves of women and children.
Excavations at the Ernest Witte site (41AU36), in Austin County on the Brazos River,
encountered four separate burial episodes resulting in burial groups from the Middle Archaic
(Group 1), the Late Archaic (Group 2), the Transitional Archaic (Group 3), and the Late
Prehistoric (Group 4) (Hall 1981). Group 1 contained 61 interments with only one Pedernales
point and six bone artifacts. Group 2, dating to the Late Archaic period, exhibited a significantly
14

greater investment in mortuary tradition than did any of the other cemetery groups at this site.
Group 2 contained 145 interments with grave artifacts of dart points, marine and freshwater shell
ornaments, antler and antler racks, ochre, bone artifacts, and ground stone. Burial Group 3
consisted of 10 interments; the only associated artifacts were seven Godley points buried with one
individual. Group 4 was composed of 13 interments with no associated mortuary furniture.
A rich Late Archaic mortuary tradition emerged in South Texas, where many large cemeteries
exhibit common themes of grave offerings of marine and freshwater shell ornaments, antlers and
antler racks, stone tools, and red ochre (Hester 1970, 1971). The flexed burial is also a common
characteristic in all of these cemeteries.
Other features found at Late Archaic sites include basin hearths, arcuate hearths, earth ovens, and
mussel shell caches. The lithic assemblages contain a variety of dart point styles (e.g., Bulverde,
Pedernales-Kinney, Lange-Williams-Marshall, Marcos-Montell-Castroville, Ensor-Frio-Fairland,
and Darl); Erath, San Gabriel, and Hare bifaces; gravers; scrapers; a variety of unifaces and
bifaces; grinding stones; and boatstones. Except for Montell and Fairland, the point styles for the
Late Archaic are among the most widely distributed dart points (Prewitt 1985). Other artifacts
include ulna flakers, bone beads and awls, stone and marine shell gorgets, and freshwater mussel
shell pendants (Prewitt 1981:81â82).

Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 700â1500) is marked by the replacement of atlatl-and-dart with
bow-and-arrow technology. Ceramics were also adopted within this period. Basin-shaped and
flat hearths and burned clay/charcoal lenses and pits are the predominant archeological features.
There is a continuation of Late Archaic burial practices with flexed and semi-flexed burials
occurring near habitation sites, usually in cemeteries but also as isolated occurrences. Some
burials were cremations, carried away from cemeteries and placed in shallow pits.
The period is divided into two main periods, the Austin (A.D. 700â1300) and Toyah (A.D. 1300â
1500), and each is marked by distinctive cultural traits. Once believed to be contemporaneous,
Jelksâs (1953, 1962) work at the Blum and Kyle rockshelter sites in Hill County demonstrated the
temporal separation between Austin and Toyah components by locating stratigraphically distinct
Perdiz arrow points above older Austin phase Scallorn arrow points. The Late Prehistoric
chronology of southern Texas is closely aligned with that of Central Texas, particular in terms of
Toyah cultural manifestations (Hester 1995:443).
The Austin phase is characterized by a shift to the use of the bow and arrow. Common are
Scallorn and other related side-notched (e.g., Edwards) arrow points, as well as broad-based
hunting and gathering as the main mode of subsistence (Turner and Hester 1999:173). Common
artifacts for this period include numerous bifaces, Clear Fork gouges, scrapers, grinding stones.
Typical features included basin hearths, pits, and cemeteries. The interments at Austin phase
cemeteries such as Loeve-Fox (41WM230; Prewitt 1981, 1974) and the Coleman site (41BX568;
Potter et al. 2005) show evidence of increased nutritional stress and social violence. In addition,
the mortuary program followed by Austin phase populations appears to contrast with that of the
Late Archaic period peoples in the area (Potter et al. 2005). There is less investment in mortuary
goods or personal adornment during this phase, and the antlers that occur in numerous Late
Archaic cemeteries are poorly represented in Late Prehistoric cemeteries.
15

The broad-based subsistence patterns of the Austin phase focused largely on gathering, though
hunting of deer along with exploitation of freshwater mussels and snails is also suggested to have
been important (Prewitt 1981:83; Ricklis and Collins 1994). The diagnostic projectile points of
the Austin period are the Scallorn and Granbury. Austin phase components have been found at
sites along waterways throughout Bexar County (e.g., Cibolo Creek [sites 41BX379, 41BX746,
41BX1005], Salado Creek [sites 41BX699, 41BX1007, 41BX1433]), the San Antonio River [site
41BX567] and the Medina River [sites 41BX1076, 41BX1104]) (Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas). Friday bifaces and unifaces, other bifaces, scrapers, ground stone, ulna flakers, and bone
awls are among the wide variety of tools. Other artifacts include painted stones, bone beads, and
marine shell beads and pendants. Projectile points are proportionately more common during the
Austin phase as hunting appears to have become increasingly important. The widespread
occurrence of Scallorn points outside of Central Texas and the frequency of marine shell indicate
a broad cultural entity and/or extensive trade networks in the Late Prehistoric.
The Toyah phase is the best known of the Late Prehistoric phases. It is distinct from the
preceding Austin phase and is marked archeologically by Perdiz and similar contracting-stem
arrow points, pottery, beveled-edge bifacial knives, perforators, and end scrapers (Black 1986,
1989; Creel 1991; Hester 1980, 1995; Jelks 1962; Johnson 1994; Kelley 1986; Prewitt 1981).
Perishable artifacts such as cordage and basketry are found at some sites. Corncobs have also
been recovered, indicating either trade relations with agricultural peoples or some degree of
horticulture (Prewitt 1981:74). Extensive trade relations are also indicated by the presence of
Caddo ceramics, such as Bullard Brushed among other imported types. Toyah phase burials
sometimes contain artifacts, but it is not established that these are grave goods. Perdiz and
Cliffton points found in burials may be from fatal wounds and indicative of increased conflict.
Sites in Bexar County associated with the Toyah phase have been recorded in Government
Canyon (e.g., 41BX133, 41BX141) and along Cibolo Creek (41BX372), the Medina River
(41BX528), and Culebra Creek (41BX1422, 41BX1423) (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas).
During the Toyah phase, a climatic shift to moister conditions allowed the savannas and
grasslands to advance, bringing the return of the bison. Subsistence strategies shifted even further
toward hunting in response to the reoccupation of Central Texas by bison (Dillehay 1974). Deer,
however, probably continued to be an important resource (Black and McGraw 1985). The
importance of bison to the Toyah economy is readily deduced from the makeup of artifact
assemblages represented at a number of archeological sites. The Buckhollow site (41KM16) in
Kimble County produced an abundance of Perdiz arrow points of many varieties (Johnson 1994).
Also found were Harahey knives, most of them containing four beveled edges. The use wear is
representative of cutting bison hides and fleshâa hypothesis supported by the recovery of large
numbers of bison bones. Also indicative of the importance of bison is the recovery of large end
scrapers from the site. The presence of edge rounding and polish on bit ends indicates use on
fresh hides, most of which were probably bison (Johnson 1994). The Hinojosa site (41JW8),
located in Jim Wells County in southern Texas, represents a Late Prehistoric Toyah base camp
dating from A.D. 1300â1500 (Black 1986). Specialized hunting adaptations are evident from the
archeological materials, though a broad subsistence base of fish, softshell turtle, aquatic birds,
and mussel shell was also exploited. Deer figured prominently in the overall assemblage, with
bison and pronghorn antelope also contributing a significant portion to overall subsistence (Black
1986). A significant component of the highly adaptive bison-oriented Toyah phase tool kit is the
end scraper used for processing hides. Creel (1991) has suggested that these tools are indicative
of the importance of trade in bison hides during the Late Prehistoric and Early Historic periods.
Bison bones occur in great frequency in many Late Prehistoric Toyah phase sites. Excavations at
41LK201 and 41MC222 along the Frio River drainage contained abundant bison bone, with the
latter site dating to around A.D. 1260â1290 (Hester 1980; Highley 1986).

HISTORIC CHRONOLOGY (A.D. 1500sâEARLY 1900s)

Historic Native American
The historic period (post-A.D. 1500) in Central Texas represents the local expression of sweeping
cultural change for native peoples across North America. Spanish missionization corresponds to
the first European influence in Texas, but it probably did not have dramatic effects until the 1600s
when native groups sought refuge at the missions from encroaching Apache and, later, Comanche
groups. Changes through gradual cultural adoption and exchange of Spanish life-ways and
materials occurred throughout the seventeenth century. After the 1700s, European material
culture became pervasive. Metal, glass, European clothing, and guns became important to native
peoples, replacing traditional items.
The early history of South and Central Texas is the most richly documented in the state. The
numerous expeditions into these parts of the region resulted in records and journals that provide
sparse glimpses into the past of the native peoples. Nevertheless, limited ethnographic cultural
data exist for the native groups that occupied this immediate area preceding the establishment of
the missions. Campbell and Campbell (1996) present a list of the groups occupying Mission San
Juan and Mission Espada, as well as the other missions in the area. For many of the groups listed,
however, original territorial ranges can only be speculated, and their material culture cannot be
differentiated from other groups residing in the missions at the time. In the nineteenth century,
the term âCoahuiltecan,â for Coahuilteco, was coined by a Mexican linguist for a related group of
native languages in the region (Campbell and Campbell 1996:17). The name came from the
Mexican state of Coahuila, which included the northern part of New Spain and most of the area
occupied by present-day Texas. Over the last century, the term âCoahuiltecanâ was widely
adopted for use in referring to the whole of the native groups living on the southern Texas plains
region and into Mexico. Although the term originally described a group of related languages, it
devolved into a common misinterpretation that was applied to a widespread ethnically related
culture believed to speak the same Coahuiltecan language. This terminology was far from
correct. In fact, the people who were subsumed under this umbrella term represented distinct
ethnic groups with distinct cultures and diverse languages and dialects (Hester 1998).
Few Historic Native American archeological sites have been investigated in the San
Antonio/Bexar County area. Supposed sites relating to the historic Indian contact period are
usually characterized by multiple components that span a long period of time. Since the historic
Indian period lasted only roughly 200 years, the material evidence occurs at shallow depths below
surface or entirely on the surface. Consequently, it is prone to modern disturbance. Stratigraphic
separation between the Late Prehistoric and Historic Native American contact components is
often limited or nonexistent. Excavations at site 41MC296, a historic native encampment on Elm
Creek in McMullen County, illustrate that European trade items were introduced to the South
Texas native peoples in advance of the Spanish entrada. Conversely, at the Olmos Dam site
(41BX1) in Bexar County, historic-era seasonal encampments made by native peoples traveling
the âPeyote Trailâ to northern Mexico were documented as late as the 1920s (Lukowski 1988).
Numerous river crossing sites with possible contact period components were identified during
historical research and survey for the Applewhite Reservoir in San Antonio. They include the
Dolores/Perez/Applewhite Crossing (41BX682); Pampopa/Paso del Talon (41BX680), one of the
documented crossings used by Native Americans prior to Spanish use; Sabinitas/Jett/Palo Alto
17

Crossing (41BX857); and Paso de las Garzas (41BX697) (Hindes 1992). Archeological
investigations were conducted at the Pampopa-Talon crossing site (41BX528), where important
roads connecting San Antonio to points along the Rio Grande pass over the Medina River.
Between 1731 and 1737, the Pampopa fled mission confinement and were pursued to their
rancherias near the âOld Fordâ of the Medina River. Historic accounts tell of encampments of
the Pampopa and other Indian groups nearby (Thoms and Ahr 1995). The Pampopa
Crossing/Ford has been positively identified at sites 41BX527 and 41BX528 on the Medina
River.

Spanish Exploration and Settlement
The initial European presence in Texas occurred in 1519 when Ãlvarez de PiÃ±eda mapped the
coastline of Texas under the order of Francisco Garay, then governor of Jamaica. PiÃ±eda laid
claim to all the land between Florida and the Rio Grande in the name of the Spanish Crown. His
explorations were followed by those of Alvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca in the 1530s. Cabeza de
Vaca was a member of the 1527â1528 expedition of PÃ¡nfilo de NarvÃ¡ez, a large expedition
charged with surveying much of the land in the southeastern United States. While inland, the
NarvÃ¡ez group became separated from the ships. Because of hostile Indians and food shortages,
NarvÃ¡ez led his men in improvised watercrafts along the Gulf of Mexico coastline, hoping to
reach the PÃ¡nuco River. A hurricane destroyed most of the group, but shipwrecked a few of the
men, including Cabeza de Vaca, on the Texas coast, probably on present-day Galveston Island, in
1528. Cabeza de Vaca lived among the coastal Indians for the next eight years. After being
enslaved by hostile Indians, he eventually made his escape, arriving at a Mexican outpost to the
west in 1536. He was the first non-Indian to wander through the Texas region, and his writings
about his travels are the first accounts of the area, generating excitement over the prospect of gold
and leading to subsequent Spanish expeditions to the region in search of the precious commodity.
Soon, Spanish authorities commissioned Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado, governor of the
Mexican province of Nueva Galicia, to lead an expedition into the American Southwest in 1540
in search of the fabled Seven (Golden) Cities of Cibola to the north (Fehrenbach 1968:23). The
expedition was a dismal failure in its attempt to find the legendary gold, but did succeed in
exploring some of Texas and New Mexico. In 1539, Hernando de Sotoâs expedition landed in
present-day Florida and over the next four years traveled across the southeastern United States.
After de Sotoâs death at the Mississippi River, Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado took command of
the expedition. By 1542, the Moscoso group had traveled as far west as Texas (Hester 1989:199)
in an attempt to reach New Spain (present-day Mexico).
As it became apparent that there were no cities of gold to exploit, settlement was somewhat
slowed until French interest in the region stimulated the Spanish to renew their colonizing efforts.
After word came in 1685 that Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, had established an outpost
somewhere on the Texas coast, the Spanish were motivated to send various expeditions to locate
and eradicate the outpost. The threat that the French presented became almost an obsession with
the Spanish:
The specter of French invasion brooded over the Spanish colony in New Mexico for nearly two
centuries. Somewhereâperhaps from the wilds of New France, perhaps from the coast of the Gulf
of Mexico, at some incalculable distanceâan indeterminable number of Frenchman were
periodically thought to threaten the silver mines of New Spain. . . . Beset with internal problems,
woefully conscious of their weakness and isolation, New Mexicans started at the very shadow of
intruders on the vague periphery of their province [John 1975:155].
18

This attitude encouraged the establishment of missions and presidios in East Texas to buffer
against further French encroachment into the region (Fox 1989:85).
Alonso de LeÃ³n mounted various expeditions into Texas between 1686 and 1690. In 1691,
Domingo TerÃ¡n was appointed governor of the province. He, accompanied by Padre Massanet,
set out to determine what French activities were occurring in the region and to establish a series
of missions among the Indians. In this pursuit, they came into the region of San Antonio, both
commenting on the fine plains and large numbers of buffalo they encountered (McGraw and
Hindes 1987:64). Padre Massanet called the area âSan Antonio de Paduaâ in honor of St.
Anthony of Padua and suggested that it would make a suitable location for a mission. A small
garrison of men was left there, and the Presidio of San Antonio de BÃ©xar was initiated (McGraw
and Hindes 1987:64). At least one source believes that the site of the presidio was initially called
âthe âlevel lands without woodsâ which . . . de TerÃ¡n and Massanet crossed when they continued
their journeyâ (Habig 1968:160).
Activities in the area were curtailed during the Eleven Yearsâ War of Spanish Succession (1702â
1713); but when the Frenchman Louis Juchereau de St. Denis traveled over much of the province
undetected in 1714, the Spanish were galvanized into action. A series of missions was planned
throughout the frontier areas of New Spain. For example, in 1716, an expedition led by Captain
Domingo RamÃ³n set out for East Texas to establish missions and a presidio, including one at a
site between the Red and Sabine rivers at Los Adaes (de la Teja 1988:51â51).
In response to the remoteness of the settlements in East Texas, the Spanish soon recognized that a
âway-stationâ was necessary to bridge the distance between the newly settled missions and San
Juan Bautista on the Rio Grande. The need for an intermediate location had been evident for
some time, and âTerÃ¡n . . . considered the upper San Antonio River valley, with its abundant
water supply, woods and agricultural land, the ideal site for missions and townsâ (de la Teja
1988:53). Of like mind was Fray Antonio de San Buenaventura Olivares who had been
impressed with the area during his visit in 1709. MartÃ­n de AlarcÃ³n, who had been recently
appointed as governor to the province, considered the opinions. It was decided that two missions
were to be founded: one on the San Antonio River and one on the San Colorado River, with the
former established first. The viceroy ordered not only missionaries and solders to populate the
new missions, but settlers and families, artisans, and livestock as well (de la Teja 1988:55).
The three-pronged approachâpresidio, mission, and civilian colonistsâthat the Spanish used for
settlement proved to be more successful than the establishment of mission and presidio or
presidio alone (Gilmore 1991). This was certainly true in the case of San Antonio. On May 1,
1718, a group led by AlarcÃ³n and including Fray Olivares founded the Mission San Antonio de
Valero on San Pedro Creek, and on May 5, 1718, the presidio and the villa of San Antonio de
BÃ©xar were established. Although ceremonially the city was founded in 1718, no actual
construction was begun until 1719 due to the lack of men and materials (McGraw and Hindes
1987:66).
A total of five missions was eventually built on the San Antonio River, all within a 12-mile radius
of the present city of San Antonio. They are, in order of establishment, as follows: Mission San
Antonio de Valero (1718), Mission San JosÃ© (1720), Mission Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la PurÃ­sima
ConcepciÃ³n (1731), Mission San Juan de Capistrano (1731), and Mission San Francisco de la
Espada (1731). The last three had initially been established in East Texas, but were relocated to
the San Antonio River area. All of the missions in present-day San Antonio were administered
19

by the order of Saint Francis. San JosÃ© was under the authority of the College of Zacatecas, and
the remaining four were under the authority of the College of QuerÃ©taro. In 1773, all the San
Antonio missions were placed under the auspices of the College of Zacatecas (Jackson 1986:33).
Each ministered to different groups of Indians.
In 1722, a short-lived mission, San Francisco Xavier de Najera, was founded for 50 families of
Ervipiami Indians brought in from the Brazos River. This mission was closed in 1726 with the
residents probably being absorbed into Mission Valero (Schuetz 1968:11). One source (Scurlock
et al. 1976:133) places the location of this mission somewhere midway between Missions San
Antonio de Valero and San JosÃ©.
During the early 1700s, population growth was slow in the San Antonio area. Initially, most
inhabitants were members of military households. AlarcÃ³nâs first settlement had included âan
engineer, stone mason, blacksmith, and a number of women and childrenâ (de la Teja 1988:56).
Fray Celiz, the chronicler of the AlarcÃ³n expedition, noted that the first attempts in 1718 to locate
settlement sites were unsuccessful. A stable water supply for the missions was necessary for both
crop production and human and animal consumption. Because of the relatively arid San Antonio
environment, the missions needed an effective way to enhance the available water supply. The
Franciscans adopted a system of irrigation ditchesâcalled acequiasâintroduced into Spain by
Moslems, and began construction in 1719 on a 15-mile network of seven gravity-flow ditches,
five dams, and an aqueduct to distribute water to about 3,500 acres of cultivated land (National
Park Service [NPS] 2005). Once the first of the acequias was operational, settlers âexpected a
large crop of maize, beans, and other produceâ (de la Teja 1988:57).
By 1721, San Antonio had become a series of wood and mud huts (jacales), typical of a Spanish
frontier settlement. All settlers, both military and civilian, were dependent on the garrison for
defense, communications, and, initially, civil administration. The missions of San Antonio
attracted a variety of Indian groups, primarily Coahuiltecan and Karankawan hunter-gatherers,
during the mid 1700s, but also attracted Indians of other origins, some of whom were fleeing
Spanish disruptions in Nuevo LeÃ³n and other regions of northern Mexico (Hester 1989:200).
However, not all Indian groups were interested in what the missions had to offer:
When our arms were first introduced in Texas, our foremost object was the propagation of faith, by the
means of evangelic predication; but, notwithstanding the endeavors and apostolic zeal of the Reverend
Missionaries, we could not succeed in gathering the Indians around the Missions. Used to a roving and
unrestrained life, the Nations of that extended territory refused to submit to the merciful yoke of the
Church, finding it rather burdensome, owning to their depraved habits. Unable to attract them to us of
their own free will, we never availed ourselves of force. . . . [Buquor 1935:2].

Mission settlements were disrupted frequently from 1721 to 1749 by raiding Apaches. Even after
a formal truce had been signed in 1749, thievery and limited hostilities took place throughout the
rest of the century (de la Teja 1988:61). Hostilities also were occurring with various Comanche
bands, who disapproved of the tentative link between the Spanish and the Apache during the last
half of the 1700s.
At the expense of the Spanish Crown, colonists from the Canary Islands had been sent to colonize
other areas with great success. The harsh economic conditions that existed on the islands,
coupled with the promise of land, made the islanders eager emigrants (de la Teja 1988:67). On
March 9, 1731, a group of colonists from the Canary Islands came to the area and were to have a
profound effect on the region. As originally conceived, an additional 400 islander families would
immigrate into the region. When it became apparent that this endeavor would be too costly, the
20

idea was abandoned and no additional families were ever recruited (de la Teja 1988:68). The
Canary Islanders were given control over lands previously allotted to the military settlers. They
also were given control over the town council and effectively barred established settlers from
participating in local government (de la Teja 1988:68). Eventually, local elections took place in
which the sitting council elected its successors. Although these elections were full of
irregularities, in the end they did provide a means by which new settlers could share in town
government.
Initially, town lots were only distributed among Canary Islanders. The distribution of land to the
islanders involves the first record of the San Antonio Town Tract (on which the city proper is
located). Captain Juan Antonio PÃ©rez de AlmazÃ¡n, who served as commander and superior
justice (justicia mayor) of San Antonio, began to lay the tract for the town of San Antonio in
1731. He had to work around the existing presidio and missions (de la Teja 1988:122) because,
in general, the land west of San Pedro Creek was considered less desirable because of its
vulnerability to Indian attack.
Population growth in the area continued at a steady rate due to a variety of factors and in part to
established access into the region via El Camino Real, also known as the Kingâs Highway or the
Old San Antonio Road. This âroadâ was not one fixed route, but one that altered with the season
and the year. San Antonio de BÃ©xar, as an established way-station, became a hub for the various
routes (McGraw and Hindes 1987).
Land use outside of BÃ©xar during the Spanish period was chiefly confined to large-scale ranching
activities. Ranching during the eighteenth century was very relaxed. Round-ups amounted to
little more than the gathering of wild, unbranded stock when meat or hide and tallow were needed
(McGraw and Hindes 1987:71). This lax attitude can be attributed primarily to the small
population and the lack of markets. However, some ranches in what is today Bexar County were
more productive (McGraw and Hindes 1987:72).
Outside political factors during the latter half of the eighteenth century had a great impact on the
region. The completion of the Seven Yearsâ War (1754â1762) and the signing of the Treaty of
Paris in 1763 resulted in the French and Spanish ceding most of the lands east of the Mississippi
River to England, and Spain acquiring the Louisiana Territory from France. This, of course, put
an end to the years of Spanish paranoia and called for a reassessment of the situation in New
Spain (McGraw and Hindes 1987:74). Local effects included the selection of BÃ©xar as the new
provincial capital.
The American Revolution encouraged economic growth in the region. Cattle from the ranches in
the BÃ©xar area were rounded up for sale in Louisiana to the Spanish who were fighting the British
along the Gulf Coast (McGraw and Hindes 1987). Another change in the region was the
beginning secularization of the missions by 1794. Secularizationâthe transition from mission
status into secular Spanish society, based on official royal decreeâwas in part a result of the
missionsâ decline in status as a response to the removal of the French threat. The second factor in
secularization was the decline of the missionsâ indigenous inhabitants in the 1790s as those
populations assimilated into Spanish society, achieving a major goal of the mission system,
through intermarriage or conversion to Christianity. Pressure from the surrounding civilians for
mission farmland (labores) increased as mission populations fell, and eventually secularization
was complete by 1824 as the last of the labores were privatized, divided, and distributed among
the remaining mission Indians and the local population (Reese 1995:K-9; Spanish Missions
2001).
21

Political events continued to have a rapid impact on the region. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803
brought about the establishment of a âno-manâs landâ between the Texas and Louisiana border.
Both Spain and America were eager to avoid a costly war. The Louisiana Purchase, however, did
generate increased American interest in Texas. Many from the former French province were
eager to emigrate:
In view of the fact that the said province has been retroceded to the French Republic and they have sold it
to the United States of America, numerous noble, influential, and rich families, as well as some poor
ones, desire to move to the provinces under your command in order that they might live under the
Spanish flag and enjoy the same kind treatment that they, as well as their predecessors, have previously
enjoyed. . . . the universal love and loyalty felt for the Spanish government is so great that we are satisfied
and believe there will be more than a thousand families, more than two hundred of them of the Spanish
nation, who will come as soon as they sell their lands . . . [Hatcher 1934:278].

This kind of attitude was not, however, prevalent throughout the Spanish colonies. Growing
discontent with Spanish rule (which had been rapidly deteriorating) in the provinces resulted in
10 bitter years of strife, beginning in 1810 and culminating with Mexican Independence in 1821.
These years had a profound effect in the region of what is today San Antonio. Filibusterers,
encouraged by the claim that Texas was actually American territory, made forays into the
province. In addition, battles were waged between Spanish loyalists and revolutionaries, and
control of San Antonio de BÃ©xar changed back and forth several times. In a particularly bloody
incident, 1,000 persons in the province who were, or were accused of being, revolutionaries were
rounded up and executed or exiled. Much of the improved farmland around BÃ©xar was left
fallow, and the town itself was almost abandoned because of the scarcity of food (Fehrenbach
1968:130).

Mexican Statehood
The period following Mexican Independence brought a slow improvement in the conditions
around San Antonio de BÃ©xar. Beginning in 1823, immigration laws were changed to allow
empresarios to offer lands to heads of families willing to settle in Texas. The policy had been
initially investigated by the Spanish as a means of securing its territory and providing a buffer
zone against Indian attack. In fact, Moses Austin had applied for and received permission to
bring American colonists to Texas in 1821, before Mexican Independence (Fehrenbach
1968:135). Austin had been granted the right to settle 300 families in Texas, but he never saw his
grant. By the time he returned to his home in Missouri, his health had broken, and before his
death he only had time to beg his son Stephen to carry out his plans (Fehrenbach 1968:136).
Stephen F. Austin willingly followed in his fatherâs footsteps, and because of the liberal land
policies, first of Spain and later of Mexico, he had many eager volunteers ready to accompany
him. Colonists had to have good moral character and were required to become Spanish (then
Mexican) citizens. They were also required to convert to Catholicism, although this requirement
was not rigorously enforced. Under Spanish/Mexican law, land was distributed as follows: one
labor (177 acres) to each family engaged in farming, one league (4,428 acres) to each family
engaged in ranching, and one-third league (1,476 acres) to each single rancher (Fehrenbach
1968:140). The government charged a flat title fee, and Austin received a fee. The law required
the land to be developed in two years or be forfeited. In all, 297 titles were issued, and only
seven were forfeited. Most of the settlers claimed to be ranchers for obvious reasons.
22

In San Antonio de BÃ©xar, local politics were affected by the Mexican Constitution of 1824.
Former Spanish provinces were turned into sovereign states, and Texas and Coahuila were
combined into one state with Saltillo named as its capital. The legislature of Coahuila passed its
own colonization laws in 1825. This continued to open up the area to Euro-American settlement,
and in all, there were some 26 empresarios in colonial Texas.
After a decade of empresarios, over 20,000 Euro-Americans, with their slaves, were in Texas.
The impact of this can be understood when realizing that the empresarios managed to settle more
of Texas in a decade than the government of Spain had settled in three centuries.
One of the effects of increased immigration was the opening and improvement of roadways,
many of which followed the earlier Spanish caminos. The influx of settlers into the region
brought changes in local politics as well, with Anglo-American immigrants gaining more power.
In many areas of Texas, Mexicans were becoming politically overshadowed by the new
immigrants. This situation alarmed the Mexican government, who passed the Decree of April 6,
1830, prohibiting the further âcolonization of Mexican territory by citizens of adjacent
countriesâmeaning the United Statesâ (Fehrenbach 1968:165). This decree also prohibited the
importation of slaves and further alienated the Anglo-American settlers.
From 1832 to 1835, a series of conflicts and temporary solutions continued to drive a wedge
between Texas and Mexico. When the Texans met in San Felipe de Austin in 1835, they adopted
resolutions and framed a state convention (to form a separate state from Coahuila). Shortly
afterward, when it became known that a Mexican army under Presidente Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa
Anna had crossed the Rio Grande bound for San Antonio de BÃ©xar to squelch the rebellious
Texans, a call to arms was issued, and hostilities were begun in earnest (Fehrenbach 1968:193).
Many of the conflicts of what would come to be known as the Texas Revolution, were fought in
and around the modern city of San Antonio. These engagements culminated in the battle at the
Alamo (formerly Mission San Antonio de Valero) in the spring of 1836. At the same time that
the Alamo was under siege, elected representatives of the Texans were meeting at Washingtonon-the-Brazos, and on March 2, 1836, the Texas Declaration of Independence was signed. After
his victory at the Alamo, Santa Annaâs forces were defeated by the Texans at the Battle of San
Jacinto, and the Republic of Texas was born.

Texas Republic
In 1836, the Republic of Texas was a âbackwaterâ with about 40,000 residents, most of whom
were subsistence farmers. When elections were first held in 1836, the Texans voted
overwhelmingly to approve a union with the United States, but the issue of slavery stood in the
way of annexation for 10 years.
The government of the new Republic was a loosely organized affair. Among the many problems
facing the new Republic was the fact that â[t]here was no money economy, nor any money.
There were no banks or improved roads or organized schools. There was no industryâ
everything from pins to powder had to be imported from the United Statesâ (Fehrenbach
1968:247). The Texans quickly replaced the old Spanish/Mexican conventions with the more
familiar American ones.

23

Bexar County was formed in 1836, with a population that was predominantly Mexican.
However, the new Republic was eager to encourage immigration, and it did so by offering its
most abundant commodityâland. Travelers across the region wrote enthusiastic letters back
home.
Texas is certainly one of the finest countries in the world, the salubrity of her climate and the luxuriance
of her soil is beyond doubt unparalleled in the known world,âhere it seems to be one perpetual spring
[Hale 1836].

Under the Republic of Texas Constitution, settlers fell into one of three classes, which dictated
the disbursal of land:
First Classâarrived before March 2, 1836
Heads of Household: one league (4,428 acres) and one labor (177 acres)
Single Man: one-third league (1,476 acres)
Second Classâarrived between March 2, 1836, and October 1, 1837
Heads of Household: 1,280 acres
Single Man: 640 acres
Third Classâarrived between October 1, 1837, and January 1, 1840
Heads of Household: 640 acres
Single Man: 320 acres.

The new settler to Texas had to find unclaimed land on his own and often would not be able to
procure land in his county of residency. The responsibility for providing witnesses who could
attest to the arrival date fell to the settler, as did the costs for the survey and filing fees. In most
counties, the Board of Land Commissioners went to work without delay because of the extreme
importance of land to the citizens. The later land laws established under the State of Texas were
set up in much the same way, but with land also being granted preemptively, through âsquattersâ
rights.â Land also was distributed in differing amounts for military service. âThus it, was
virtually impossible, theoretically, for a Texas family to be landlessâ (Fehrenbach 1968:283).
With the question of annexation to the United States unanswered, Mexico again laid claim to
Texas as part of its territories in 1837. During this period, San Antonio and Bexar County once
more became the setting for numerous hostilities between Mexican and Texan forces. Finally,
after truce had been declared in 1843, the question of annexing Texas was once again raised in
the U.S. Congress. By this time, sentiment had shifted in the United States, and on December 29,
1845, Texas was annexed officially.
Near the current project area, the community of Bergâs Mill was named for a milling operation
that was started initially during the Republic period. Bergâs Mill was established around 1840 by
Roderick T. Higginbotham, who began a saw-and-grist mill in that location (Scurlock et al.
1976:229). He apparently held the mill until 1842, when he sold all or part of it to his brother-inlaw William P. Kerr. The mill was probably at the same location as a stone building remnant that
has been identified variously as âthe stone ruin at Bergâs Mill,â or âArnoldâs Millâ after Hendrick
Arnold. Arnold was a âfree blackâ man who came to Texas from Mississippi and settled in
Austinâs Colony on the Brazos River around 1826 (Scurlock et al. 1976:229). He later relocated
to San Antonio. Although some degree of uncertainty exists as to when the mill property
transferred to Arnold, it is nevertheless known that he died in the cholera epidemic of 1849
(Scurlock et al. 1976:233).
24

This same property eventually came into the hands of Colonel L. W. Ashley and through him to
Henry L. and Louis S. Berg around 1879. They established a profitable wool-washing mill
(several landowners in the area owned sheep) and cotton gin on the property (Scurlock et al.
1976:235). They ran the mill successfully until they had a financial reversal that led eventually to
the transfer of the property to Gustave Hellmans in 1888. The location of âHellmansâ can be
seen on the 1903 USGS map for San Antonio, Texas. This mill was subsequently sublet and the
wool business phased out around 1900. The cotton gin apparently remained active until 1910
(Scurlock et al. 1976:238).

American Statehood
The annexation of Texas by the United States brought about many changes in the region.
Commerce, which had faltered in the Republic period during hostilities with Mexico, improved.
San Antonio became a center for stagecoach travel into the region (McGraw and Hindes
1987:95). Immigration from the rest of the United States increased rapidly, as did the arrival of
refugees from abroad. The population became much more diversified. One interesting fact
relating to San Antonio is that âby 1850, and for many years afterward, European, mostly
German, immigrants in San Antonio outnumbered both Mexicans and Anglosâ (Fehrenbach
1968:285).
During the early years of statehood, the San Antonio region continued to be âAnglicized.â This
was true in all areas and was demonstrated by a growing use of more âAngloâ types of
architecture and building materials. In San Antonio itself, small businesses thrived and fledgling
industries developed.
In Texas, the political situation, like that throughout the United States, was uneasy during the
1850s. When the rest of the South seceded from the Union in 1860â1861, the state of Texas
voted overwhelmingly to follow. In general, the region around San Antonio fared better that
most during the Civil War. When San Antonio was named the headquarters for the Cavalry of
the West in 1864, some of the smaller communities actually benefited from this posting as a
result of the increased travel through the region (McGraw and Hindes 1987:99).
The initial years after the Civil War, however, brought several setbacks in the region. Much of
the area had suffered from a severe drought in 1863. In some areas where slaves once had
worked large plantations, tenant farming became the norm. In the latter years of the century, land
speculation seemed to be very common.
After Reconstruction, the community of Bergâs Mill began to take shape around the milling
operations. In 1885, the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad made its first stop at the Bergâs
Mill Railroad Depot and Platforms. Bergs Station can be seen on the 1903 USGS map for San
Antonio, Texas, along with several other structures. Sometime prior to 1914, a cotton platform
was added but its use was discontinued in 1935 (Scurlock et al. 1976:130). The Bergâs Mill
community also had a schoolhouse that initially was a one-room structure, built prior to 1904. A
four- or five-room building was constructed around 1914 to replace the original school (Scurlock
et al. 1976:140). According to Scurlock et al. (1976) there were several other historic structures
at the Bergâs Mill community: the Mariano ZÃºÃ±iga House, formerly a one-room adobe structure
built during the last half of the nineteenth century; the Antonia HurÃ³n House, an adobe structure
constructed about 1850; the Kunze Store and Saloon, built in the 1880s; Bergâs Mill Movie and
25

Community Building, built around 1913; and the Chapa Store, built about 1929 by Ernst Kunze
(who owned the store and saloon) from materials removed from the Movie and Community
Building.
In 1913 and 1919 the City of San Antonio experienced record rainfall and flooding. In 1920, the
city began to seek a solution to the flooding hazards that existed along the San Antonio River.
The primary concern was to enable the river to carry a greater capacity of water that would
accomadate the âhundred-year floodâ. After much deliberation the city settled on the
construction of a detention reservoir on the Olmos by raising a concrete dam and a cut-off across
the Great Bend to shorten the channel and allow for a better slope. In 1923 taxpayers voted to
approve flood prevention bonds in order to carry out the proposed construction. Between 1923
and 1941 the river project was completed and included massive alterations of the stream for flood
control as well as downtown river beautification (Fox et al. 2002).

CHAPTER 4
METHODOLOGY

As mentioned previously, this was a phased project for planning purposes; a detailed literature
review was conducted first to determine the number of known resources in the area as well as
examine the potential for any unknown resources that might be impacted by the siphon
replacement, and then the review was followed by fieldwork once design criteria were initiated
and fully examined. The work conducted in the first phase of investigations included an
examination of the THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and the Texas Historic Sites Atlas,
which revealed that the project area crosses one National Register Historic District, the Mission
Parkway Historic District, but no archeological sites have been recorded in the project area itself.
However, there are 43 previously recorded sites, 10 known cemeteries, and seven National
Register-listed properties within the 1-mile study area. Details can be found in Bastis (2007) and
will not be presented here.
The second phase of work was to be the field survey of the project corridor and consisted of
reconnaissance and pedestrian survey. The reconnaissance survey was conducted along Old
Corpus Christi Road where survey the pipeline will be open-cut within the street right-of-way.
Pedestrian survey was conducted along the remainder of the corridor, and shovel test units were
excavated at pull pit locations (Figure 2), in the open-cut area near Rilling Road, and on either
side of Six Mile Creek. Each shovel test was approximately 35 cm in diameter and was
excavated to depth of approximately 50 cm below surface because the extremely dry conditions
had resulted in soil so compacted that the shovel could not penetrate the ground to a much greater
depth. Ground visibility was fairly good also due to dry conditions resulting in thin grass cover in
most areas. In addition, several areas contained erosional cuts allowing for better examination of
subsurface contexts. The excavated soils were screened through 0.25-inch hardware cloth and
were recorded on standardized forms, as were any artifacts discovered in shovel tests. The survey
conditions were documented using digital photography, and all photographs were recorded on
standardized forms. All materials collected from this project will be permanently housed at the
Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio.
Geotechnical cores were excavated at several locations along the corridor. One core (Core B-2,
08-2050) located on the west side of the San Antonio River was examined and analyzed by a
geoarcheologist for evidence of cultural potential. The core was housed at the offices of Arias
Associates, Inc., in San Antonio. The samples comprised 11 gallon-sized ziplock bags of core

fragments that were loose in the bags. Some of these (specifically the finer-grained deposits)
retained structure and some semblance of stratigraphic integrity, whereas others (typically the
sands and gravels) were completely loose in the bag and lacked any form of stratigraphic
integrity. To a depth of 8 ft, the core samples were 1.5 inches in diameter, and below that they
were about 3 inches in diameter. Where more than one distinct deposit was present in a bag, each
part was described and given a separate designation (e.g., 0â2', A; and 0â2', B). The core
samples were described in detail and summarized in general form. An interpretive sketch of the
likely stratigraphy was provided.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

RESULTS
Both a reconnaissance and a pedestrian survey with shovel testing in selective areas along the 1.9mile corridor were undertaken (see Figure 1). As mentioned earlier, the project area runs
southward along Old Corpus Christi Road from Southeast Military Drive then angles about 30
degrees to the southwest, crossing the San Antonio River and Six Mile Creek before terminating
at the flow transfer station at Rilling Road. The reconnaissance survey was conducted along Old
Corpus Christi Road where the pipeline will be open-cut within the street right-of-way. Since
buried and aerial utilities are evident on both sides of the street, as are very shallow, contoured
drainage swales, no shovel tests were excavated along this stretch (Figures 3 and 4). The east
side of the road right-of-way is fenced and occupied by Brooks City Base, and the west side of
the road right-of-way is bounded by several different parcels, some fenced, one wooded, and one
large apartment complex with manicured lawns, flowerbeds, and a concrete driveway. The
triangular parcel to the southwest where the pipeline converges at the intersection of Old Corpus
Christi Road at Henderson Court has been previously used for dumping but at the time of survey
was being cleared and new dirt was being added to make a building pad (Figure 5). The pipeline
will be slip-lined from this corner to the east side of the San Antonio River. A small drainage
runs along the southern edge of this parcel but expands into a wide, pooled area at South Presa
and below the built-up pad (Figure 6). From the intersection of Old Corpus Christi Road and
Henderson Court, the line crosses South Presa Road, the Union Pacific railroad track, the dry San
Juan Ditch or acequia (Figure 7) in the SARA-owned, city-operated park on the east side of the
San Antonio River (Figure 8), and the San Antonio River; where it crosses the river, the line will
be open-cut (Figures 9 and 10). The area between the railroad track and the San Juan Ditch
undulates, containing numerous erosional ditches and dumped materials (concrete, brick, asphalt)
and, closer to the park, extensive amounts of trash. The pull pit for the slip-liner on the east side
of the river will be emplaced on the bank within the park.
On the west side of the San Antonio River, the slip-liner will be pulled from a pit on the bank
within the San Antonio Mission National Register Historic District on National Park Service
(NPS) property and extend to the south edge of Ashley Road and Stinson Airport. Between the
NPS property and Ashley Road, the pipeline crosses the property of the Mission Development
Center, a corner of city land, and Stinson Airport; the old pipe corridor is quite evident on the

landscape in this area (Figures 11â13). Shovel Test 4 (see Figure 1) was excavated at the location
of the pull pit south of Ashley Road near the left edge of a deep drainage (Figure 14) that drains
into Six Mile Creek. The soil was a mixture of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2, dry) and
yellowish brown (10YR 5/6, dry) extremely hard-packed clay, and no artifacts were found or
observed down to about 27 cm bs where digging was stopped due to the extremely dry conditions
and hardness of the soil. In addition, the area around this shovel test is extremely eroded with
numerous drainage cuts; in fact, trying to locate a level surface to excavate the unit was difficult.
Old tires had been thrown or piled in the trees just to the left and right of the old pipe and
obviously has been used as a dumping area for some time (Figure 15). The pipe will slip-lined
from this area under Six Mile Creek and several private properties to about 950 ft before Rilling
Road. Walking down this drainage to Six Mile Creek was the easiest avenue to the creek bed.
Where the ground cover had not completely taken over, exposures of gravels and bedrock were
seen (Figure 16).
Though the pipe will be slip-lined through here, the banks of Six Mile Creek were examined:
they are generally steep but have slumped in some areas. The exposure directly across from the
drainage below Ashley Road shows layers of varying-sized gravels and cobbles throughout the
profile (Figure 17). The banks at the actual siphon crossing have slumped, though the
gravel/cobble stratigraphy is still apparent when closely examined (Figure 18). A concrete collar
for an old manhole from the former 30-inch siphon replaced in the 1980s by the 30-inch force
main is located in the center of the creek at the siphon crossing (Figure 19). Neither bank appears
to contain a buried soil that would likely have been occupied, but rather consists of numerous
layers of large gravels and fist-sized cobbles indicative of high-energy flooding.

Shovel Test 5 was placed next to a surveyorâs nail on the south bank of Six Mile Creek (Figure
20). The soil is a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2, dry) silty clay that was fairly compact in
the top approximately 10 cm, but became quite compact below this level. Small calcium
carbonate pebbles also were evident starting at about 10 cm below surface and continued
throughout the unit, though sparse in number. The unit was sterile. The general area around this
shovel test is somewhat void of materials except for a small spattering of modern plastic, paper,
cellophaneâthe types of materials that are blown around or caught up in floodwaters. There are
some large piles of debris and a couple of tires hanging in trees above this area, indicating high
floods in the past.
Shovel Test 3 (see Figure 1) was excavated along the pipeline where a pull pit is planned and
where several property lines come together at an old abandoned road. The road is slightly builtup from the surrounding properties, particularly higher than the north side, and appears to have
been maintained (graveled in the past) and mowed periodically. Several San Antonio Water
System manholes were observed along this road, indicating that a sewer line runs east-west along
it. Debris dumped and piled on the edge of the two-track at the southeast corner of the corridor
indicated that a site might be hidden in the trees. Though there were several piles of debris
(Figure 21) (e.g., soda or liquor bottles, oil cans, plastic bottles for auto-related maintenance
liquids, asphalt shingles, and lumber), all were located just inside the trees along the road and did
not appear to be anything more than dumped materials. A flagged stake was near the manhole
along the two-track designating the pipeline (Figure 22). Shovel Test 3 was placed about 10 m
south of the road and along the current alignment and just outside the tree line (Figure 23). The
excavated soil was very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2, dry) clay, hard-packed with some

calcium carbonate granules throughout. Some materials (three small sandstone fragments and a
fuse base) came from the top 5â7 cm of the unit. No other artifacts were observed, and the
sandstone is thought to be natural. The unit was terminated at about 30 cm below surface when
the soil became too hard to penetrate due to the extremely dry conditions in the San Antonio area.
The exit pull pit on the south end of the corridor is located about 950 ft north of Rilling Road
where the remainder of the pipeline will be open-cut to the storage facility situated on the south
side of Rilling. Two shovel tests were excavated about 200 ft apart along this open-cut area near
flagged stakes found in the woods (Figure 24). Shovel Test 2 was excavated closer to the north
end of the open-cut area and Shovel Test 1 was closer to Rilling Road (see Figure 1). Both units
exhibited disturbances with strong brown (7.5YR 4/6, dry), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, dry), and
light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4, dry) clay mixed in with the very dark grayish brown (10YR
3/2, dry) clay that is the original surrounding soil (Figure 25). A single piece of asphalt was
found in the top 20 cm of Shovel Test 1, but no artifacts were found in Shovel Test 2. Several
small dumps of tires and 5-gallon drums were adjacent to the corridor on the east side (Figure
26).

Geotechnical cores were excavated at two locations along the corridor, one each on the east and
west sides of the San Antonio River (Figures 27 and 28; see Figure 1). The core on the east side
to the river was excavated inside the levee to a depth of 20 ft, and the west side core was
excavated at the top of the bank to a depth of 40 ft. The west side core sample (B-2, 08-2050)
was examined and analyzed to determine the potential for a stable surface that might contain
cultural deposits. In general terms, three distinct sedimentary bodies appear to comprise this
core: (1) introduced earthen fill; (2) Historic age or Late Holocene age San Antonio River
alluvium; and (3) Tertiary bedrock (Figure 29).
The top part of the core (the top 4 ft with certainty, and possibly as deep as 6 ft) is composed of
introduced earthen fill. The intimate juxtaposition of gravel and clay deposits in these levels is
consistent with fill earth, and the density of some of this material seemed anomalously high,
which is a common attribute of mechanically compacted fill earth.
The middle part of the core, between approximately 6 and 30 ft is composed of Holocene
alluvium. This body of natural, apparently in situ sediment is composed of episodically deposited
stream sediment, and the deposit as a whole gradually fines upward. The top 4 ft is a fine-grained
(silty clay) overbank deposit that contains occasional thin laminae of sand. Freshwater mussels
and bits of charcoal were also observed in this zone. Between approximately 10 and 16 ft, a
channel deposit primarily composed of sand and gravel was present. Between 16 and 21 ft, a
fine-grained deposit with considerable gravel was present, and this deposit most likely represents
a floodplain swale or abandoned channel deposit that accumulated mud during low magnitude
floods and sands and gravel during larger flood events. Although the bag samples did not clearly
demonstrate stratification, this deposit is probably quite stratified when viewed in context. The

presence of mottles in this deposit suggests that it is periodically saturated. The base of the
Holocene alluvium (to a depth of approximately 28 ft or slightly less) consists of coarse-grained
channel sands and gravels, and these sediments are also mottled.
The lack of significant secondary or pedogenic calcium carbonate within these deposits, absence
of other significant pedogenic alteration, and the relatively coarse texture of the deposits suggest
that this body of alluvium is of Late Holocene age and most likely correlative with
allostratigraphic Unit D, described by Frederick (2007:57). This suggests that the deposit is
either of Historic age, or slightly older. The age estimate for Unit D is based upon the relative
stratigraphic position of these sediments within the San Antonio River alluvial sequence, but
because none of the Unit D deposits have been dated (by radiocarbon or artifactual inclusions) the
age estimates for this deposit should be considered very tentative. The apparent thickness of
these deposits is considerably greater than any Unit D deposits previously observed along the San
Antonio River, but is within the limits of expectation.

The basal unit in the core comprises a fine-grained, weakly calcareous to noncalcareous,
micaceous, prominently laminated clay that contains many thin stringers (laminae) of sand to
sandy loam. This deposit is unlike any of the previously observed Holocene alluvial deposits and
is most likely one of the Tertiary bedrock units. The Bureau of Economic Geology (1974) maps
most of this portion of San Antonio as a Pleistocene terrace gravel. The deposit underlying the
gravel is not portrayed by the Bureau of Economic Geology, but examination of the deposits east
and west of the Pleistocene gravels suggests that the bedrock in this location is either the Eoceneage Midway or Wilcox Groups. The general attributes of this deposit (specifically the
noncalcareous and micaceous nature, and the prominent stratification) are consistent with this
interpretation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The replacing of the Old Salado siphon pipe is being designed to exist within the original
easement measuring 1.95 miles long and 35 ft wide except at the San Antonio River, which is
being widened and deepened. There will be a 200-ft bore at a depth of 8 feet below the channel
(Figure 30) as planned by the U.S. Corps of Engineers for river enhancements that include
channel modifications (widening and deepening) and riparian vegetation installation to provide a
more natural river environment. Overall, the corridor has been affected by previous impacts that
include road, park, and levee construction; utility installations; river rechannelization; and
associated modern activities. The only area thought to have escaped some of these previous
impacts is the area of deep sediment deposits along the river that will be open-cut. The analysis
of the coring conducted as part of this project, as well as previous investigations along this stretch
of the river (see Peter et al. 2006), indicate that the top several (6â12) feet, depending on location,
of the current floodplain is the result of the rechannelization activities that occurred in the 1960s.
Below this depth, the sediments are natural alluvium and river channel deposits to a depth of at
least 40 feet.
The analysis of core B-2, 08-2050, generally describes the sediments as recent or even Holocene
age. This analysis is supported by the 1929 aerial of the area that shows small channels, adjacent
historic acequias, and the main channel of the San Antonio River flowing differently from what is
currently observed (Figure 31).
In particular, the fine-grained floodplain deposits between 6 and 10 ft may hold a limited
potential for in situ cultural deposits since these sediments were deposited on the floodplain of the
San Antonio River in a low-energy setting that would not necessarily have been perceived as a
flood risk by previous inhabitants. The finer-grained deposits between approximately 16 and
21 ft may hold similar potential, but the gravel mixed with this deposit indicates it was
occasionally subjected to high-energy floods. The channel deposits situated from approximately
10â16 ft and 21â28 ft are unlikely to contain cultural deposits. That these deposits indicate
Holocene-aged sediments does not signify that archeological deposits exist within these
sediments, nor particularly in this portion of the corridor.
The profile found in the banks of Six Mile Creek also indicates high-energy flooding with little
chance of stable surfaces suitable for human habitation for any length of time. The potential for
the sediments along Six Mile Creek to contain cultural resources is extremely low to not likely.
Six Mile Creek empties into the San Antonio River just east of this location and exhibits much of
the same development seen in cores and backhoe trenches excavated in previous investigations
(Osburn et al. 2007; Peter et al. 2006).
49

Based on the results of the reconnaissance and limited intensive survey and the analysis of the
core boring along the corridor, no significant cultural resources would be impacted by the
proposed construction for the replacement of the old siphon pipe, and it is recommended that the
project be allowed to proceed without further investigations.
