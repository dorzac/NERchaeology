A Thousand Site Legacy: Digitizing PPHM Archeological Site Records
Andy Burcham
Texas Archaeological Steward
Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum
Abstract

The Panhandle-Plains Historical
Museum (PPHM) in Canyon, Texas has
embarked on a long-term site digitization
project. For historical reasons, many of the 2500+ sites documented in the Texas
Panhandle were originally recorded using an internal site numbering system rather
than the Smithsonian Trinomial System. While just over half of these sites have
since been assigned trinomials by TARL and appear on the Archeological Atlas,
the remainder of the sites have not been formally recorded.
The project to digitize these remaining sites will require multiple phases to
incorporate all the site information. This paper describes the first step; obtaining
site location coordinates in digital form. A methodology is described for capturing
site location coordinates from the collection of paper USGS Topo Quads. Also, a
computational strategy is shown for cross checking that site locations are unique,
and not already formally recorded.

Biography
Andy is a retired Chemical Engineer who now enjoys Archeology as an
avocational pursuit. He is a regular volunteer in the PPHM Archeology Department, has been a PAS member since 2015, and has attended 3 TAS Field
Schools. Thanks to a nomination from Rolla Shaller, Andy became a Texas Archeological Steward in 2019. Other interests include travel, hiking, and activities
as a Texas Master Naturalist.
