ABSTRACT
The City of Childress, which is located in Childress County, Texas,
intends to construct an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) and motocross trails and
associated facilities on approximately 586 acres north of and adjacent to
US 287 approximately 8.2 miles northwest of Childress. During May and
June 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of tract and recorded four archaeological sites
(41CI117-120) and six isolated occurrences. All of the archaeological sites
were lithic procurement sites. Two (41CI118 and 120) have been eroded
and deflated onto the ground surface. We consider these ineligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NHRP) or as State
Archeological Landmarks (SAL). Site 41CI119 may contain a buried
cultural deposit and we recommend its avoidance. Site 41CL117 is an
eroded gravel area on the terrace edge adjacent to Baylor Creek. It may
also contain a buried cultural deposit in the terrace edge 4.5 m below the
grass covered terrace. We recommend that this site also be avoided.
Although the City of Childress has agreed to avoid the sites, if avoidance
is not possible, we recommend that the site be tested to determine its
eligibility for nomination to the NHRP or as a SAL. Few cultural materials
were uncovered in 104 shovel tests and the materials include a primary
flake from site 41CI119 and a core fragment and a broken biface of
Tecovas chert from site 41CI117.
If the sites are avoided, AR Consultants recommends that further cultural
resources investigations are unwarranted. If buried cultural resources are
uncovered during construction, work should immediately cease in that
area and the Texas Historical Commission should be advised.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Childress, the county seat of Childress County, Texas, purchased
approximately 586 acres upon which the City intends to develop approximately 15 miles
of all-terrain-vehicle (ATV) trail, a motocross track, parking lot and associated facilities.
The acreage is located approximately 4,639 feet northwest of the community of Carey.
The study area specifically is located north of and adjacent to US 287 and south of and
adjacent to Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railroad (Figure 1). The proposed park is
bisected by Baylor Creek which has two large intermittent tributaries that drain into it
within the study area. Elevations range from 1730 to 1847 feet msl. Baylor Creek drains
generally north a distance of less than a mile before emptying into the broad floodplain of
the Prairie Dog Fork of the Red River.
The City of Childress contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. to conduct an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of the approximately 586-acre tract. The survey was
completed during May and June of 2008. The purpose of the archaeological survey was
to determine if cultural materials older than 50 years were present, and if so, make
recommendations about their significance and how they might be impacted by
construction.
Since the City of Childress is a political entity of the State of Texas, an antiquities permit
was required and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission issued
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4911 for the archaeological survey. The City also will
be receiving funds from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for the construction of
the ATV trail and related facilities. Since Baylor Creek is present within the study area,
and falls under the purvey of the US Army Corps of Engineers, relevant federal
legislation may include Section 404 Permit for the Clean Water Act, the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as
amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the
Cultural Environment,” and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural
Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission will not act only as the State Agency reviewer but also as the Section 106
review agency as well.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural environment and cultural history of the study area. This is followed by a
description of the research design and the methodology used to carry it out. The results of
the investigation follow and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents
recommendations that arise from the study. A list of references cited concludes the
report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Childress County is located within the Rolling Plains (Diggs et al. 1999:4) and the Palo
Duro Basin physiographic province (Frenzel et al. 1988:264) which is part of the
Southern Great Plains. More than 10,000 feet of evaporite and clastic facies sediments
were deposited in the Basin during the Permian and Tertiary periods. This is the eastern
extension of the Permian Red Beds area of Texas. The soil consists mainly of sandy loam
which supports a wide variety of grasses. The major drainage in the county is the Prairie
Dog Town Fork of the Red River which bisects the study area on its way to the river.
Tributaries to the Prairie Dog Town Fork such as Dry Salt, East Salt and Spiller (Buck)
creeks render much of the central and northern portions of the county unfit for farming
(Abbe 2008:1).
Four soil types are listed within the study area on the NRCS website. The two major soil
types are Altus-Grandfield complex with 1 to 3 percent slopes which is a fine sandy loam
and Knoco-Badland complex which consists of clay loam. Hilgrave very gravelly sandy
loam with 3 to 30 percent slopes is present and the Baylor Creek’s channel is mapped as
containing Yomont silt loam. The deepest subsoil which belongs to the Altus series is
described as being present 15 inches (38 cm) below the ground surface. The bedrock
geology underlying these soils consists of the Permian-aged older Blaine Formation and
the younger undivided Whitehorse Sandstone and Cloud Chief Gypsum (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1968). The Blaine Formation contains shale, siltstone, sandstone,
gypsum and dolomite. The Whitehorse Sandstone contains sand, shale, gypsum and
dolomite whereas the Cloud Chief Gypsum is composed of gypsum.
Baylor Creek is mapped as intermittent on the USGS map and Brune (1981:116-118)
does not list any springs within the study area.
Mesquite and cedar are the dominant plant species in the area but there are also dense
stands of mixed pasture grasses, composites, and cacti. Blair (1950:110) includes the
Permian red beds area of Texas in the Mesquite Plain District of the Kansan biotic
province. A similar description is used by Diamond and others (1987: Figure 1). In most
areas, the uplands have been cleared of brush and either are farmed or used as pastures.
The native fauna are those that characterize the Southern Plains. Buffalo and antelope
were once common and today deer, along with a wide variety of mammals including
beaver, raccoon, squirrel, rabbits, coyote, and armadillos are present. Numerous birds,
fish, and amphibians also call the area home, although the saline nature of the generally
intermittent water prohibits an abundance of freshwater-adapted animals.
Hughes (Hughes 1988:7, 1991:7-9), based upon Antevs’ climatic model (1955) postulates
three main climatic periods for the Texas High Plains. The cool moist Anathermal ranged
from circa 8000 to 5500 BC and ample water was present for creeks and rivers. Alluvial

sediments accumulated and dune fields began to stabilize. Grass and the large bison herds
that fed upon it were present. At the end of the period, increasing temperatures and the
lack of precipitation caused the grass to shrink in area and as a result the giant bison
disappeared and the modern bison herds began to decline.
During the Altithermal (circa 5500 to 2000 BC), frequent spells of warm dry weather
diminished the vegetation which exposed the soil to erosion. Streams and ponds dried up
and floodplains were being covered by wind blown dust. With the disappearing
vegetation and lack of water, bison herds and other game animals almost disappeared
from the High Plains. This period is referred to as “the Long Drought.”
From 2000 BC to the present, the climate has been cooler and moister during the
Medithermal. Fluvatile and lacustrine deposition resumed as did soil development and
dune stabilization. Animals returned to the High Plains. However, the climate may have
been gradually warming and becoming dryer.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The following chronology for the prehistory and history of the Lower Great Plains and
Childress is taken from Beene and Peter (1997) who have done the closest work to the
survey area in Childress County.
Euro-American
Protohistoric/Early Historic
AD 1541 to present
Plains Village (Florescent)
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Plains Woodland (Formative)
Archaic
Late
Middle
Early
Paleoindian

AD 1541 to present
AD 1541 to 1875

AD 1250 to 1450
AD 800 to 1250
AD 1 to 800
1000 BC to AD1
3000 to 1000 BC
6000 to 3000 BC
circa 9,800 to 6000 BC

There is a limited amount of evidence that indicates PaleoIndian and Early/Middle
Archaic Native American, circa 9,800 to 1,000 BC, occupation in the Rolling Plains
region. Paleoindians were present due to the number of Clovis points discussed by Bever
and Meltzer (2007:91) from the area. According to Bever and Meltzer, the Southern High
or Great Plains, which includes the study area as part of the Rolling Plains, was one of
three areas that showed the greatest frequency and density of Clovis points. The people in
the southern portion of the High Plains mainly used Edwards chert for point making
instead of Alibates flint/dolomite which was utilized in the northern portion. Most of the
information derived about the Paleoindian and Early/Middle Archaic occupation of the
Lower Great Plains is derived from the Panhandle and southern Oklahoma.
Occupation became intensive during the Late Archaic period based on the Crowell
Reservoir research design (Peter et al. 1994:33) in nearby Hardeman County and
continued into the Late Prehistoric period, or as the Formative and Florescent States
(circa AD 800 to 1541) as used by these authors. There is some evidence that adaptation
changed significantly over this period of time, but the density of the prehistoric
population may have decreased. Late Archaic sites tend to be small open camps or
workshops that contain a large number of Clear Fork Gouges. Plants are being utilized as
indicated by the number of manos and metates (Cliff et al. 1993:25). According to
Dillehay (1974), bison were abundant during the Late Prehistoric times and contracting
stemmed arrow points appear and are seen as evidence for bison hunting. New
technology consists of the bow and arrow and pottery between AD 1 and 800 during the
Formative stage (Beene and Peter 1997:31). Small village sites are present northwest in
the Panhandle of Texas and north in Oklahoma during the Late Prehistoric but no
evidence of houses have been found in Childress County.

From about 1510 to 1700, the Wichita controlled the area but were replaced by the Lipan
Apache until the Comanche entered into the Plains in about 1750 (Beene and Peter
1997:37). During the 18th century, several Native American nations entered the area,
probably from Kansas, to escape from the Osage.
By the late 1870s, Childress, which was named after George C. Childress, author of the
Texas Declaration of Independence, became a county. By the late nineteenth century,
various Native American groups were settled on reservations, the buffalo were
exterminated and ranchers began to settle the county. The OX Ranch contained almost all
of the south half of Childress County and parts of Cottle and Motley counties while the
Shoe Nail and the Iron Miller ranches contained the rest of the county (Abbe 2008:1).
After the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad extended into Childress County, farming
became established by the late 1880s. By the 1850s, the county became a center of the
transportation network due to the railroads through county and the population grew as
well. However, during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl years, the population
declined reduced drastically (Abbe 2008:2-3).
By the 1920s, improved roads through the county not only allowed for a population
growth but an increase in farming and ranching as well. After 1961, the oilfield would
enter the economic picture and the county continues to grow today (Abbe 2008:4-5).
The City of Childress is the county seat for Childress County. The city developed out of
two town sites, Childress City and Henry. After many disputes between the railroad and
the local population as to what the county seat was, a compromise was reached and
Henry was renamed Childress as it is today, but the City portion was dropped. Along
with the railroad came prosperity in the form of farming and ranching until the Great
Depression, but increased activity in the railroad shops alleviated some of the effects of
the Great Depression on the city’s population. The city rebounded with the advent of new
farm machinery and the presence of new roadways. Manufacturers such as Lanchart
Industries, Royal Park Fashions and the Fiberglass Corporation of America and the
petroleum industry supplanted the decreasing railroad economy. Childress, the Gateway
to the Panhandle, is an important agribusiness center today and continues to grow
(Anderson 2008:1-2).
Previous Investigations
Major archaeological surveys have been done in Childress County as part of the US
Army Corps of Engineers chloride control projects (Hughes 1973; Brooks et al. 1973).
Seventy-seven prehistoric sites ranging in age from Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric were
recorded in Childress, Collingsworth, Cottle and Hall counties. Site types include open
campsites, quarry/workshops and a burial. Geo-Marine, Inc. (Beene and Peter 1997)
recorded 77 prehistoric, 1 historic and 1 both prehistoric and historic sites during the
archaeological survey of approximately 7,470 acres in Childress County for areas XIII
and XIV of the Red River Chloride Control Project which is north of the study area on
the north side of the Prairie Dog Town Fork. Some of the sites already had been recorded

by Brooks and others (1973). Sites were located on topographic elevations, terraces and
on elevations above flooding in the floodplain. Prehistoric site types include lithic
scatters and open camp sites and range from Archaic to Late Prehistoric. The historic site
is of a homestead.
Eight 20th century homesteads (41CI108-115) were recorded during the archaeological
survey of the Childress Municipal Golf Course (Szarka and Briscoe 2005) which contains
191 acres located on the east side of the city. No prehistoric sites were recorded in this
upland area.
No archaeological sites are listed within the study area on the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (2008). Site 41CI11, a small prehistoric site from which 2 Marcos points were
collected, is located overlooking what today is Baylor Lake. The site is adjacent to a
spring and is located approximately 1.64 miles southwest of the study area.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The purpose of this research design is to insure that fieldwork made a contribution to the
prehistory and history of Childress County, Texas. Based on the known prehistoric and
historic archaeology of the area, we proposed the following three research questions.
The first research question concerns the prehistoric occupation of the study area.
It was predicted that the study area had little likelihood of having been
occupied prehistorically due to the low biotic diversity and lack of
perennial water. Since upland gravel may be present, the presence of
quarry sites is likely.
The second question concerns the historic occupation of the study area.
It was predicted that historic sites were likely to be located along
roadways in well drained settings that were not farmed.
The third question guided the survey work in this survey as well as any archeological
survey done.
How did past people use the land, what record of this use did they leave
behind?
Methodology
The study area contains approximately 586 acres and, armed with the USGS map, soil
map, shovels, a camera and field notes, the archaeologists carefully inspected the ground
surface in north-south or northwest-southeast oriented transects spaced approximately 30
m apart. They also made notes about the vegetation, soil and soil exposure and took
photographs. Since the study area is in an upland setting, shovel tests were placed in
locations that might contain cultural resources as suggested by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (2002) and adopted by the Texas Historical Commission. Shovel tests were
dug in undisturbed areas and at approximately 100 m intervals on the banks of Baylor
Creek. Shovel tests were excavated to approximately 50 cm below the ground surface due
to the fact that cultural materials may have migrated downward in the sandy loam
matrices. The sandy loam was screened through a ¼-inch hardwire screen and the pit
walls were visually inspected for cultural materials.
Backhoe trenching was not done due to the fact that Baylor Creek did not have a well
developed floodplain in which cultural materials would be buried and preserved.

RESULTS
This portion of the report is broken into several parts. The study area is described first
and followed by a discussion of the archaeological survey. Conclusions derived from the
survey conclude the chapter. Shovel tests are described generally in the text but plotted
on Figure 7 and described in Table 1.
The survey area
The survey area consists of generally level to gently and steep slopes. Trees are
dominantly mesquite but plum, cedar and hackberry are present. Understory vegetation
includes grama grasses, bunch grass, saw greenbriar, grape vine, prickly pear, barrel
cactus, hook cactus, yucca, broomweed, hog brush and other grass species. General
vegetation is shown in Figure 2. Abundant quartzite, petrified wood and limestone
cobbles were present along ridges. Permian aged gypsum and limestone deposits
outcropped on the surface on terraces overlooking Boston Creek. Numerous gullies and
tributaries to the creek were present and ranged from a meter wide and deep to several
meters wide and deep (Figure 3), especially in the northern portion of the study area.
Ground visibility was rarely less than 30 percent (Figure 4) and ranged to 90 percent.
Eye-height visibility was excellent in unforested areas but was about 30 meters in
forested areas. The area has been disturbed by bulldozing (Figure 5).
Baylor Creek varied from 3 to 5 meters wide and from 3 to 6 meters deep. Bank walls
ranged from 45-degrees to vertical (Figure 6). No buried cultural materials were seen in
the bank walls. The substrate consists of sandy loam and limestone and quartzite gravel
and cobbles. No water was present, and, according to Mr. Bobby Sanders, had not flowed
in the last ten years. Although the City of Childress reported a spring present, one was not
found and Mr. Bobby Sanders did not know of one located in the study area.
Deer and turkey were seen, and, according to Mr. Sanders, have repopulated the county
in the last 30 years. Interestingly he and another informant mentioned that the deer
appeared to be growing larger, probably as a result of the deer feeding off crops and
being fed by ranchers. Quail, cottontail rabbit and two species of lizards and a coral snake
also were seen.
The survey
Based upon the topography, the study area was broken into three portions (Figure 7).
Section 1 ranged from the northern boundary to the northern bank of Baylor Creek and
Section 2 ranged from the southern bank of the creek to the southern boundary of the
arroyo that bisects the southern portion of the study area. Section 3 ranged from US 287
to the arroyo.

Section 1.
The terrain of Section 1 ranged from ridge top to gentle to steep slopes and had several
drainages running through the area. Survey began at the northwestern corner of Portion 1.
Thirty-two shovel tests (1 through 32) were excavated. Generally on benches overlooking
gullies and drainages, the sandy loam ranging from 4 to 29 cm overlaid the sandy loam B
horizon that extended from 49 to 56 cm bs. On ridge tops, sandy loam from 3 to 6 cm
overlaid limestone bedrock. Silty loam was uncovered in Shovel tests 30-32 along the
west bank of Baylor Creek. Three Isolated Occurrences (IOs 103) were found in gravel
fields along the ridge top (Figure 8) and are discussed below. In addition, sites 41CI117
and 118 (Figure 8) were recorded and are discussed below.
Section 2
Survey began adjacent to the railroad track and east of Baylor Creek and then went south
and then southeast. Most of the terrain is upland terrace overlooking a large gully that
runs northwest-southeast that bisects the southern part of the study area. Shovel tests 33
through 61 were excavated within this portion. Shovel tests 33, 34 and 35 were excavated
adjacent to and on the east bank of Baylor Creek and encountered silty loam ranging
from 52 to 57 cm bs. Shovel tests 36, 37, 38 and 40 were placed on higher upland
benches and encountered sandy loam that contained decayed gypsum and limestone to 51
cm bs. Clayey loam was uncovered in Shovel tests 39, 41-43. 45. 46. 50, 51, 54, 58, 59

and 61 which were excavated on lower upland bench slopes. Shovel tests excavated along
ridges and adjacent to the gully encountered loam ranging from 10 to 26 cm bs overlying
limestone and gypsum bedrock. Isolated occurrences 4, 5 and 6 were found in gravel
fields along the gully and sites 41CI119 and 120 were recorded on benches (Figure 8).
They are described below. This portion of the study area appears more eroded than
Section 1. Section 1 is higher in elevation and downslope movement of material may
have buried the benches; therefore, they are not as eroded as in Section 2.

Section 3
The surveyors began the survey east of Baylor Creek and south of the gully. Transects
were oriented north-south. Twenty-four (62 through 85) shovel tests were excavated
within this section. Sandy loam or clayey loam was encountered in shovel tests 62, 65,
71, 77 and 82-85 at depths ranging from 49-58 cm bs. Sandy loam containing decayed
gypsum and limestone bedrock was uncovered in shovel tests 64, 68, 70, 73-76, 78 and
79 from 39 to 53 cm bs. Twenty-six cm of sandy loam overlaid clayey loam that
extended to 54 cm bs in shovel test 80. Sandy loam overlying sandy loam containing
degrading gypsum and limestone was uncovered in shovel tests 63, 66, 67 and 72. The
contact ranged from 15 to 27 cm bs and the shovel tests were terminated between 49 and
54 cm bs. Clay loam and sandy loam extending to 17 and 33 cm bs overlaying bedrock
was exposed in shovel tests 69 and 81. No archaeological sites were found south of the
gully but IO 6 was recorded (Figure 8). Again, this area appeared to be heavily eroded
and the reason may be similar to that of Section 2.
Archaeological sites
Four archeological sites (41CI117-120) were discovered during the archaeological survey
and all four are lithic procurement areas (Figure 8). The sites were revisited and recorded
after the archaeological survey was conducted.
Site 41CI117 (Figure 9) was first recognized in a gravel deposit on the eroded slope
below the first terrace of Baylor Creek. The origin of the gravel may be just below the
surface of the terrace but may also be in an eroded out gravel deposit about two meters
below the terrace surface (Figure 10). Tested Ogallala gravels and primary flakes are on
the slope but along with these pieces was a single tertiary blade of Alibates chert. Gravel
covered an area approximately three by seven meters on the slope. Shovel test 101 was
placed on the slope two meters below the terrace surface and a Tecovas chert core
fragment was recovered in the matrix. The matrix may the result of slumping but it
appeared to be in place. The terrace is eroded to the south and makes a ninety degree turn
and is eroded into an almost vertical bank that is six meters tall. Two thin gravel layers
are present, one just below the grass and the second is three meters below. A snapped
biface was found eroding out of the creek bank 4.5 m below the terrace surface. The
biface is made of Tecovas chert/jasper (Figure 11) and measures 4.51+x 2.96x1.43 cm
and weighs 19.9 gr. Shovel test 104 was dug at this spot and no additional evidence of a
buried deposit was uncovered.
Because of the possibility of there being buried cultural materials at this site even though
diagnostic artifacts and cultural features were not encountered, we recommend that the
site be avoided. If this is not possible, then it should be thoroughly tested to determine if
it should be considered for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
Site 41CI118 (Figure 12) is located on the south bank of Baylor Creek on a slightly
resistant gypsum knoll onto which Ogallala gravel has been deflated. Observed plants

include prickly pear cactus, yucca, mesquite trees, broomweed, grama grasses and other
grass species. Ground visibility ranged from 70 to 100 percent (Figure 13). The site area
is approximately sixty meters in diameter. The site contains primary flakes and tested
quartzite and petrified wood cobbles. The ratio of artifacts is approximately one artifact
per 75 square meters.

Shovel tests 92 through 97 were excavated within the upper portion of the knoll which
had a thin layer of soil over the bedrock. Culturally sterile sandy loam overlaid gypsum
bedrock at depths ranging from 2 to 20 cm bs.
Due to the deflated nature of the site (lack of integrity), lack of depth and absence of
cultural features, this site is considered ineligible for nomination to the NHRP or as a
SAL.
Site 41CI119 (Figure 14) is located on a knoll that overlooks the Baylor Creek
floodplain. The site is approximately 230 m east-west by 80 m north-south. Vegetation
includes mesquite trees, broomweed, yucca, grama grasses and other grass species. The
cleared corridor adjacent to the BNSF track is on the north side of the site outside the
fence and the southern side of the site is a bladed dirt road that parallels the railroad track
on the east and turns southwest and goes to a windmill that is in the Baylor Creek valley
some ten meters lower than the site. A portion of the site area is covered with vegetation
anchored in a relatively thick layer of soil and while this soil may have covered some
artifacts made from gravel, the buried gravels are not likely to have been exposed for use
in the past. The western part of the site consists of a gravel pavement that has been
deflated on to the underlying gypsum bedrock. Gravels are present in the eastern part of
the site but the bedrock has not been exposed. Ground visibility ranged from less than 30
to 100 percent. This site is unusual in that it contained two interior quartzite flakes as
well as primary and secondary flakes. More testified petrified wood and chert cobbles
were present among the tested quartzite cobbles and one possible tested Tecovas jasper
cobble was present.

Six shovel tests (86-91) were excavated within the site. Shovel tests 86, 87 and 91
uncovered culturally sterile sandy loam overlying gypsum/limestone bedrock from 5 to
21 cm bs. Shovel test 90 encountered 63 cm of culturally sterile sandy loam as did shovel
test 89 but gravel was discovered at 28 cm bs. The shovel test was terminated at 51 cm
bs. Fifty-five cm of sandy loam was encountered in shovel test 88 but a primary flake
was uncovered at 47 cm bs.
Based upon the presence of the primary flake recovered in shovel test 88, this site may
contain buried cultural features or artifacts. This fact indicates that the site may be
eligible for nomination to the NHRP or as a SAL.
Site 41CI120 (Figure 15) is located on a bench and slope. The site is approximately 55 m
north-south and 650 m east-west. It also is deflated onto the gypsum bedrock e ground
surface although the northeastern portion of the site contains a thin layer of soil.
Vegetation is similar to the other sites except that yucca and mesquite trees are more
abundant. Ground visibility ranged from 50 to 100 percent. Primary and secondary flakes
as well as quartzite and petrified wood tested cobbles were present. However, a broken
biface (Figure 16) was discovered on the ground surface and is made either from Tecovas
jasper or Alibates chert. The biface’s dimensions are 30.6x14.1x9.2 mm. Both Tecovas or
Alibates must have been transported to the site by its aboriginal inhabitants and not by
geological processes. The biface was broken during manufacture. The artifact ratio is
approximately one artifact per 68 square meters. Shovel tests 98 through 100 were
excavated in the northern portion of the site and uncovered culturally sterile sandy loam
overlying bedrock gypsum at depths ranging from 7 to 15 cm bs.
Due to the lack of a buried site deposit (site deflation), diagnostic artifacts and cultural
features, this site is deemed ineligible for nomination to the NRHP or as a SAL.
Isolated occurrences
Six isolated occurrences (IO) were discovered during the archaeological survey and the
locations of the gravel fields in which they were found are shown on Figure 8. There are
additional gravel fields in the survey area and it is possible that other IOs may be present.

Conclusions
As expected, only lithic procurement sites were recorded. What was not expected was the
apparent depth of the site 41CI117 deposit. The terrace may be relatively young and no
indications were found that a major occupation or a significant occupation surface is

present. Nevertheless, the presence of the core two meters below the surface and the
biface at 4.5 m below the surface may indicate that buried cultural materials could be
found in this immediate area within the floodplain or elsewhere along Baylor Creek and
possibly near the mouths of the tributaries that drain the upland and have built up
outwash fans where they empty into the floodplain or into the Baylor Creek channel.
Consequently, it makes sense to avoid this area and to continue to be observant of the
creek banks.

Abundant Ogallala cobbles were present on the eroded ridge tops and may be present
under those areas where soil has not been eroded. According to Banks (1990:95), the
material is predominantly quartzite but chert, Tecovas jasper/quartzite and petrified wood
also are present. Chert and Tecovas jasper/chert cobbles were rather scarce and many had
been tested. After examining the flakes, it appears that primarily fine-grained quartzite
has been utilized. The gravel obviously deflated onto the ground surface, especially in the
vicinity of Baylor Creek where erosion has been the greatest, and, is not in primary
context nor are the flakes or tested cobbles except for possibly at site 41CI119.
Based upon the results of the archaeological survey, we have defined high and medium
areas potential for encountering archaeological sites and isolated occurrences (Figure 17).
The high potential site area is along Baylor Creek and on the upland ridges overlooking
the creek where all four sites were found. The medium potential area is along the ridges
and on both sides of the southernmost drainage where the natural gravel fields occur.
This pattern is a microcosm of the pattern reported for the Red River Chlorine Control
Project study completed by Geo-Marine, Inc.

potential area and the blue is the area of medium potential.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the archaeological survey, site 41CI119 should be avoided and protected
because it has the potential to contain buried cultural features. Although the artifacts from
site 41CI117 are not temporally diagnostic, the possible buried occupations situated at 2
m and 4.5 m below the surface lead to the recommendation that the site should be
avoided. After discussions with the City of Childress, it was decided that site 41CI117
and 119 will be avoided (Appendix A).
Sites 41CI118 and 120 have deflated onto the ground surface; therefore, no site integrity
is present and no diagnostic artifacts are present as well. We recommend that no further
work be done on these sites and that they are not eligible for nomination to the NRHP or
as a SAL.
Based upon the results of the archaeological survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc.
(Beene and Peter 1997) and this report, we further recommend that future archaeological
surveys in the vicinity of the study area focus on drainages and upland terraces and
ridges.
We further recommend that if buried cultural deposits are uncovered during construction,
work should stop immediately in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be notified.
