ABSTRACT
On behalf of River City Engineering and Canyon Regional Water Authority (CRWA), SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for the Wells
Ranch Crystal Clear Transmission Line in Guadalupe County, Texas. The work was conducted as part of
the sponsor’s compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Permit Number 6678) and the National
Historic Preservation Act in anticipation of a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-Fort Worth
District under Nationwide Permit 12 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The project area is located
3.5 miles northwest of Geronimo, Texas, between State Highway 46 and Farm-to-Market Road 758.
The CRWA proposes to replace and install a new 16-inch-diameter water main line within existing
CRWA easements, other utility easements, and private property. Installation of the pipeline will require
trenching and boring within a 50-foot-wide construction easement. Typically, trenching impacts would be
6 to 7 feet deep, while bore pits would be 8 to 10 feet deep. The area of potential effects (APE) is a 4.3mile alignment. During the course of the project, approximately 2.7 miles of the alignment was rerouted
after the original route was surveyed. The 2.7-mile alternative route was ultimately abandoned. This
report includes the results of the investigations of both the abandoned alternative route and the final
Crystal Clear Alignment. The total APE for the Crystal Clear project area is 26 acres.
The investigations included a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing
of the project area boundaries. The background review determined that two small portions of the project
area have been previously surveyed by the Lower Colorado River Authority, the Texas Department of
Transportation, and the Farmers Home Administration. Additionally, two previously recorded sites
(41GU43 and 41GU87) are adjacent to the southwest portion of the project area. Two previously
conducted surveys and seven previously recorded archaeological sites are located within a 1-mile radius
of the project area. A review of historic maps dating from 1921 and 1958 indicate there were several
historic-age resources within or adjacent to the proposed alignment.
Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed that the proposed project area is within a rural setting
intersected by fence lines, overhead utility lines, existing underground utilities, and road ways. Almost the
entire APE consisted of plowed field affording 90 to 100 percent ground visibility. A total of 50 shovel
tests were excavated within the available APE. Shovel tests were excavated to depths ranging from 30 to
60 centimeters below ground surface and consisted of clay and clay loam. The Texas Historical
Commission’s survey standards for projects of this size recommend 16 shovel tests per linear mile when
the right-of-way measures less than 100 feet wide, or 69 shovel tests for the current project area. Due to
high ground surface visibility and previous disturbances within the APE, SWCA reduced the number of
shovel tests as subsurface exploration was not warranted in certain areas. One isolated find was
encountered within the northeastern end of the project area. No evidence of previously recorded sites
41GU43 and 41GU87 were documented within the project area. One archaeological site, 41GU167, was
documented during survey investigations of the abandoned alternative route, but does not extend into the
final Crystal Clear Alignment.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural
resources properties within the APE. As no properties were identified that meet the criteria for listing on
the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark, according to 13
TAC 26.8, SWCA recommends no further cultural resources work within the project area..

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
of the Canyon Regional Water Authority Wells Ranch Crystal Clear Transmission Line Project

INTRODUCTION

Investigations consisted of an intensive
archaeological survey with shovel testing of the
proposed APE. All investigations were conducted
in accordance with Texas Historical Commission
(THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
standards, as well as the guidelines provided in
Section 106 of the NHPA. Laura I. Acuña served
as Principal Investigator. Laura I. Acuña, Katie
Sloan, Sophia Salgado, Matthew Stotts, and
Daniel Rodriguez conducted field work on
October 29–30, 2013, and October 2 and 16, 2014.

SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
for the Canyon Regional Water Authority
(CRWA) Wells Ranch Crystal Clear Transmission
Line (Crystal Clear) in Guadalupe County, Texas.
The project area is located 3.5 miles northwest of
Geronimo, Texas, between State Highway (SH) 46
(also known as Old Seguin Road) and Farm-toMarket (FM) 758 (Figure 1).

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The work was conducted on behalf of the River
City Engineering and CRWA, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, as part of their
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
under Permit Number 6678. Additionally, the
project is subject to permitting requirements
through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) Fort Worth District under Section 404
of the Clean Water Act, Nationwide Permit 12. As
such, the investigations are designed to comply
with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA), as amended, and its
implementing regulations (36 Code of Federal
Regulations [CFR] Part 800).

The proposed Crystal Clear Alignment begins just
southwest of SH 46, approximately 0.2 mile
northwest of the SH 46 and Avery Parkway 78
intersection. From this boundary, the project area
extends northeast for 4.3 miles across agricultural
fields, undeveloped property, Dauer Ranch Road
(FM 129), and FM 758 before terminating south of
the FM 758 and Barbarosa Road (FM 107A)
intersection. The abandoned 2.7-mile alternative
route begins at Dauer Ranch Road and directs
northeast, terminating south of the Barbarosa Road
and FM 758 intersection.

The CRWA proposes to replace and install a new
16-inch-diameter water main line within existing
CRWA easements, other utility easements, and
private property. Installation of the pipeline will
require trenching and boring within a 50-foot-wide
construction easement. Typically, trenching
impacts would be 6–7 feet deep, while bore pits
would be 8–10 feet deep. The area of potential
effects (APE) is a 4.3-mile alignment. During the
course of the project, approximately 2.7 miles of
the alignment was rerouted after the original route
was surveyed. The 2.7-mile alternative route was
ultimately abandoned. This report includes the
results of the investigation of both the abandoned
alternative route and the final Crystal Clear
Alignment. The total APE for the Crystal Clear
project area is 26 acres in size, with depths ranging
from 8 to 10 feet deep.

Located in western Guadalupe County, the project
area is within the Guadalupe-San Antonio River
Basin and is intersected by Alligator Creek, an
unnamed tributary of Geronimo Creek, and an
unnamed tributary of the Guadalupe River. The
Guadalupe River is located 0.78 mile west from
the project area and the historic Lake Dunlap Dam
is approximately 1 mile southwest. A review of
aerial photography illustrates disturbances
consisting primarily of residential construction,
two-track roads, vegetation clearing, and
agricultural fields (Figure 2). The surrounding area
is gradually transitioning from a rural ranch and
agricultural setting to a residential and commercial
development, with two subdivided residential
neighborhoods bordering the southwest end of the
project line. The project area is situated in the New
Braunfels East (2998-414) U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps.

and adjacent to the western limits of the Central
Texas archaeological region as defined by Perttula
(2004). Given its proximity to the Central Texas
archaeological region, the following prehistoric
cultural history derives its information from
several central Texas regional chronologies: Black
(1989), Collins (1995, 2004), and Johnson and
Goode (1994), which build upon the seminal
efforts of Suhm (1960) and Prewitt (1981, 1985).
Significant archaeological sites within the Central
Texas archaeological region and the Edwards
Plateau have contributed important information to
understanding prehistory.

GEOLOGY
The geology of the project area is mapped as
Leona Formation, and Navarro Group and
Marlbrook Marl undivided (Barnes 1983). The
Leona formation consists of fluviatile terrace
deposits of gravel, sand, silt and clay on the first
wide terrace of the Nueces and Leona Rivers and
below the level of Uvalde formation. Leona may
correlate with Onion Creek marl of Austin Sheet
(Barnes 1983). Navarro Group and Marlbrook
Marl undivided are comprised of clay, calcareous,
with variable amounts of silt, glauconite and
limestone beds (Barnes 1983).

The following prehistoric cultural sequence is
divided into three periods: Paleoindian, Archaic,
and Late Prehistoric. The Archaic period is
subdivided into four subperiods: Early, Middle,
Late, and Transitional. The Historic period follows
the Late Prehistoric, announcing the arrival of
Europeans to central Texas.

SOILS
The soils of the project area consist of several soil
series. Seventy-five percent of the project area
consists of Branyon Clay with 0 to 1 percent
slopes (Natural Resources Conservation Service
[NRCS] 2014). These are very deep, moderately
well-drained, very slowly permeable soils that
formed in calcareous clayey sediments. These
soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping
Pleistocene terraces (NRCS 2014). Fifteen percent
of the project area consists of Houston black clay
with 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2014). These are
very deep, moderately well-drained, very slowly
permeable soils that formed from weakly
consolidated calcareous clays and marls of
Cretaceous Age. They are located on nearly level
to moderately sloping uplands (NRCS 2014). Five
percent of the project area consists of Barbarosa
silty clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes. These soils
consist of deep, well drained, slowly permeable
soils that formed in clayey sediments. They are
located on nearly level to gently sloping uplands
(NRCS 2014). Finally, the remaining 5 percent of
the project area consists of Tinn Clay with 0 to 2
percent slopes (NRCS 2014). These are very deep,
well-drained, very slowly permeable soils that
formed in calcareous clayey alluvium. These soils
are located on floodplains of streams that drain the
Blackland Prairies (NRCS 2014).

PREHISTORIC CULTURAL SETTING
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Human occupation of the Central Texas
archaeological region is thought to have begun
approximately 11,000 years ago. This period
correlates with the end of the Late Pleistocene, the
last ice age in North America. These early Texans
are characterized by small but highly mobile bands
of foragers who were specialized hunters of
Pleistocene megafauna; however, Paleoindians
probably used a much wider array of resources,
including small fauna and plant foods (Bever and
Meltzer 2007; Bousman et al. 2002; Bousman et
al. 2004; Dering 2007; Meltzer and Bever 1995).
Faunal remains from Kincaid Rockshelter and the
Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) support this
view (Collins 1998; Collins et al. 1989).
Surficial and deeply buried sites, rockshelter sites,
and isolated artifacts represent Paleoindian
occupations in the central Texas region. Although
Paleoindian site types are not well documented in
the region, they can be generally classified
according to broad site type categories
extrapolated from nearby regions. Both open and
protected (rockshelter) types are known. Usually,

patterns does not yet exist. Early Archaic sites are
small, and their tool assemblages are diverse (Weir
1976:115–122), suggesting that populations were
highly mobile and densities low (Prewitt
1985:217). A variety of choppers and gouges, such
as the triangular, concave-based bifaces known as
Guadalupe tools and the distally beveled Clear
Fork unifaces are present in the archaeological
record. A variety of expediency tools, often
nothing more than utilized flakes, are increasingly
present in the Early Archaic (Black 1989). It has
been noted that Early Archaic sites are
concentrated along the eastern and southern
margins of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson and
Goode 1994; McKinney 1981). This distribution
may indicate climatic conditions at the time, given
that these environments have more reliable water
sources and a more diverse resource base than
other parts of the region.

these sites are near permanent sources of water
such as tributary creeks or springs. Bison kill sites,
open and protected campsites, and non-occupation
lithic sites are known from the Paleoindian period
in Texas. Intra-site features include hearths and
isolated burials. The Wilson-Leonard site
(41WM235), 41BX52, and 41BX229 contain
stratified Paleoindian deposits (Hester 1980). The
lower component at the Wilson-Leonard site
contained a Paleoindian burial (Collins et al.
1998).
ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Archaic period for the Central Texas
archaeological region dates from ca. 8800 to
1300–1200 B.P. (Collins 2004) and generally is
believed to represent a shift toward hunting and
gathering of a wider array of animal and plant
resources and a decrease in group mobility (Willey
and Phillips 1958:107–108). For central Texas,
this notion of the Archaic is somewhat
problematic. An increasing amount of evidence
suggests that Archaic-like adaptations were in
place before the Archaic period (Bousman et al.
2002; Collins 2004:117–118, 1998; Collins et al.
1989) and that these practices continued into the
succeeding Late Prehistoric period (Collins
2004:118–119; Prewitt 1981:74). In a real sense,
the Archaic period of central Texas is not a
developmental
stage,
but
an
arbitrary,
chronological construct and projectile point style
sequence. Establishment of this sequence is based
on
several
decades
of
archaeological
investigations at stratified Archaic sites along the
eastern and southern margins of the Edwards
Plateau. Collins (2004) and Johnson and Goode
(1994) have divided this sequence into three
parts—early, middle, and late—based on
perceived (though not fully agreed upon by all
scholars) technological, environmental, and
adaptive changes. However, Turner and Hester
(1999) and Black (1989) have designated another
period at the end of the Archaic, referred to as
Transitional Archaic or Terminal Archaic.

The construction and use of rock hearths and
ovens, which had been limited during the
Paleoindian period, become commonplace in the
Early Archaic. The use of rock features suggests
that retaining heat and releasing it slowly over an
extended period was important in food processing
and cooking and reflects a specialized subsistence
strategy. Such a practice probably was related to
cooking plant foods, particularly roots and bulbs,
many of which must be subjected to prolonged
periods of cooking to render them consumable and
digestible (Black et al. 1997:257; Wandsnider
1997; Wilson 1930). Botanical remains, as well as
other organic materials, are often poorly preserved
in Early Archaic sites, so the range of plant foods
exploited and their level of importance in the
overall subsistence strategy are poorly understood.
But recovery of charred wild hyacinth (Camassia
scilloides) bulbs from an Early Archaic feature at
the Wilson-Leonard site provides some insights
into the types of plant foods used and their
importance in the Early Archaic diet (Collins
1998).
MIDDLE ARCHAIC
Cultural patterns during the Middle Archaic period
(6000–4000 B.P.) point toward an increased
sedentary population intensively harvesting
acorns, prickly pear, and pecans and hunting small
and medium-size game such as deer and turkey.

EARLY ARCHAIC
The Early Archaic period (8800–6000 B.P.) is
better documented than the Paleoindian period;
however, a complete understanding of cultural

LATE ARCHAIC

The increase in the number of Middle Archaic
sites and burials supports the concept of a larger,
more sedentary population (Black and McGraw
1985; Prewitt 1981:73; Weir 1976:124, 135).
Large bands may have formed at least seasonally
to occupy a single area or small groups may have
used the same sites for longer periods (Weir
1976:130–131).

During the succeeding Late Archaic period (4000
to 1300–1200 B.P.), populations continued to
increase (Prewitt 1985:217). As evidenced by
stratified Archaic sites such as Loeve-Fox, Cibolo
Crossing, and Panther Springs Creek, the Late
Archaic components contain the densest
concentrations of cultural materials of all the
Archaic periods. Establishment of large cemeteries
along drainages also suggests certain groups had
strong territorial ties (Story 1985:40).

Sites of the Middle Archaic are numerous and
often large in size. Burned rock middens are found
at many sites with Middle and Late Archaic
components in the Central Texas archaeological
region. The development of burned rock middens
toward the end of the Middle Archaic suggests a
greater reliance on plant foods, although tool kits
still imply a considerable dependence on hunting
(Prewitt 1985:222–226). Middle Archaic projectile
point styles include Bell, Andice, Calf Creek,
Taylor, Nolan, and Travis. Other artifacts from the
Middle Archaic are choppers, gouges, and
expediency tools such as the small, bifacial and
unifacial Clear Fork tools. Grinding stones and
bases, referred to as manos and metates, show up
in Middle Archaic artifact assemblages as well as
a number of perforators, drills, and awls. Chipped,
polished, and ground stone artifacts are common
in central Texas and surrounding regions. Less
frequently encountered artifacts include tools and
ornaments of bone, antler, and marine shell
(Turner and Hester 1999).

Middle Archaic subsistence technology, including
the use of rock and earth ovens, continues into the
Late Archaic period. Collins (2004:121) states that
at the beginning of the Late Archaic period, the
use of rock ovens and the resultant formation of
burned rock middens reached its zenith and that
the use of rock and earth ovens declined during the
latter half of the Late Archaic. There is, however,
mounting chronological data that midden
formation culminated much later and that this high
level of rock and earth oven use continued into the
early Late Prehistoric period (Black et al.
1997:270–284; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795). A
picture of prevalent burned rock midden
development in the eastern part of the Central
Texas archaeological region after 2000 B.P. is
gradually becoming clear. This scenario parallels
the widely recognized occurrence of post-2000
B.P. middens in the western reaches of the
Edwards Plateau (Goode 1991).

Bison populations decreased as more xeric
conditions returned during the latter part of the
Middle Archaic. Later Middle Archaic projectile
point styles (Nolan and Travis) represent another
shift in lithic technology (Collins 2004:120–121;
Johnson and Goode 1994:27). At the same time,
this shift to drier conditions saw the burned rock
middens develop, probably because intensified use
of geophytic or xerophytic plants meant the debris
from multiple rock ovens and hearths accumulated
as middens on stable to slowly aggrading surfaces,
as Kelley and Campbell (1942) suggested many
years ago. Johnson and Goode (1994:26) believe
that the dry conditions promoted the spread of
yuccas and sotols, and that it was these plants that
Middle Archaic peoples collected and cooked in
large rock ovens.

The use of rock and earth ovens (and the
formation of burned rock middens) for processing
and cooking plant foods suggests that this
technology was part of a generalized foraging
strategy. Considering the amount of energy
involved in collecting plants, constructing hot rock
cooking appliances, and gathering fuel, the caloric
return of most plant foods is relatively low (Dering
1999). This suggests that plant foods were part of
a broad-based diet (Kibler and Scott 2000:134) or
part of a generalized foraging strategy—an idea
Prewitt (1981) put forth earlier. At times during
the Late Archaic, this generalized foraging
strategy appears to have been marked by shifts to a
specialized economy focused on bison hunting
(Kibler and Scott 2000:125–137). Castroville,
Montell, and Marcos dart points are elements of
6

Several researchers believe that the increased
interaction between groups at the end of the Late
Archaic was an important catalyst for cultural
change (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994).
This change may have included increased regional
stress and conflict between groups as interaction
became more frequent (Houk et al. 1997). In
Bexar County, for instance, researchers noted a
distinct shift in settlement patterns during this
period (Houk et al. 1997). Groups began to use
hilltops as camps rather than just lithic
procurement locations. These elevated locations
would have provided points from which to observe
game and other groups of humans as they moved
through the surrounding creek valleys and upland
prairies (Houk et al. 1997).

tool kits often associated with bison hunting
(Collins 1968). Archaeological evidence of this
association is seen at Bonfire Shelter in Val Verde
County (Dibble and Lorrain 1968), Jonas Terrace
in Medina County (Johnson 1995), Oblate
Rockshelter in Comal County (Johnson et al.
1962:116), John Ischy in Williamson County
(Sorrow 1969), and Panther Springs Creek in
Bexar County (Black and McGraw 1985).
TRANSITIONAL ARCHAIC
As Collins (2004:122–123) notes, diverse and
comparatively
complex
archaeological
manifestations toward the end of the Late Archaic
attest to the emergence of kinds of human conduct
without precedent in the area. This period (2250–
1250 B.P.), referred to as the Transitional Archaic
(Turner and Hester 1999) or Terminal Archaic
(Black 1989), is not recognized by all researchers.
Other chronologies terminate the Late Archaic at
around 1200–1250 B.P. (Collins 2004; Johnson
and Goode 1994) to encompass this later
subperiod. Johnson et al. (1962) originally
designated the Transitional Archaic as a subperiod
of the Archaic because of the similarities between
the latest dart point types and the earliest arrow
point types. Since then, however, the designation
has failed to be universally accepted by
researchers. In two recent chronologies for central
Texas, Collins (2004) does not include the
Transitional as a subperiod of the Archaic, and
Johnson and Goode (1994) separate the Late
Archaic into two subperiods designated Late
Archaic I and Late Archaic II. The Transitional
Archaic, as it is used here, closely corresponds to
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II, but
begins after the appearance of Marcos points, not
with it. In this scheme, the Transitional Archaic
coincides with the last two style intervals
recognized by Collins (2004) for the Late Archaic
subperiod.

Overall, the Archaic period represents a hunting
and gathering way of life that was successful and
remained virtually unchanged for more than 7,500
years. This notion is based in part on fairly
consistent artifact and tool assemblages through
time and place and on resource patches that were
used continually for several millennia, as the
formation of burned rock middens show. This
pattern of generalized foraging, though marked by
brief shifts to a heavy reliance on bison, continued
almost unchanged into the succeeding Late
Prehistoric period.
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction of the bow and arrow and later,
ceramics into the Central Texas archaeological
region marks the Late Prehistoric period (1250–
350 B.P.). Population densities dropped
considerably from their Late Archaic peak (Prewitt
1985:217). Subsistence strategies did not differ
greatly from the preceding period, although bison
again became an important economic resource
during the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period
(Prewitt 1981:74). Rock and earth ovens were
utilized for plant food processing (Black et al.
1997; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795). Horticulture
came into play very late in the region but was of
seemingly minor importance to overall subsistence
strategies (Collins 1995:385).

During the Transitional Archaic, smaller dart point
forms such as Darl, Ensor, Fairland, and Frio were
developed (Turner and Hester 1999). These points
were probably ancestral to the first Late
Prehistoric arrow point types and may have
overlapped temporally with them (Carpenter et al.
2006; Hester 1995; Houk and Lohse 1993).

Artifact assemblages include Scallorn, Perdiz, and
Edwards projectile points, worked stone, thermally
altered stone, hematite, bone, and shell. The points

association with burned rock middens represents
more than a “thin veneer” capping Archaic-age
features. Black et al. (1997) claim that burned rock
midden formations, although not as prevalent as in
earlier periods, was part of the adaptive strategies
of Toyah peoples.

are associated with the use of the bow and arrow
in the region, probably introduced sometime
around 1350–1150 B.P.
The earlier Austin phase (identified by Scallorn
and Edwards points) and the later Toyah phase
(defined through Perdiz points) divide the Late
Prehistoric period throughout central Texas (Black
1989; Story 1990). These divisions were originally
recognized by Suhm (1960) and Jelks (1962) and
remain an accepted separation of the period.
Although a distinct change in the material culture
between the two phases can be seen in the
archaeological record, there is some debate over
the cultural underpinnings that prompted the
change. The different arrow point styles (and other
associated artifacts in the assemblage) may
represent distinct cultural groups (Johnson 1994),
but others challenge this view (e.g., Black and
Creel 1997) and attribute the change to a spread of
new technological ideas in response to the increase
of a different economic resource in bison
populations
(Ricklis
1992).
Nevertheless,
prehistoric groups traced through cultural remains
assigned to the Austin phase (1250–650 B.P.), as
many of the Archaic period cultures before them,
relied on a hunting and gathering subsistence with
more of an emphasis on gathering (Prewitt
1981:83). Groups attributed to the Toyah phase
(650–200 B.P.) relied more on bison procurement
(Prewitt 1981:84).

HISTORIC CULTURAL SETTING
Landscape features have dictated human
movement and subsistence patterns for thousands
of years. Specifically, geographical influences
during the Historic Period confined settlements to
riparian zones and limited farming to these areas.
The larger, rugged landscape was used for sheep,
goat, and cattle ranching. These practices were
introduced and promoted by the Spanish as part of
their colonial agenda and many were carried
through to the twentieth century, giving Texas a
strong agricultural history dominating economic,
social and cultural patterns over the years
(Freeman 1994).
The Historic period in this region (A.D. 1630 to
present) in Texas roughly begins when Europeans
first enter the region. However, several sixteenth
century expeditions have been reported to the area.
Most notably Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca’s
travels, stemming from the failed 1527 Panfilo de
Narvaez expedition. Cabeza de Vaca reportedly
lived and traveled with various aboriginal groups
across coastal and interior Texas around A.D. 1528
(Chipman 2011; Foster 2012; Krieger 2002).
Although Cabeza de Vaca’s exact path is not clear,
some sources suggest his journey came through
this part of central Texas in 1534, but others
indicate it was farther south (Smryl 2013). Alonso
de León, whose expeditions were south of the
project area, named the Guadalupe River in 1689
in honor of the Lady of Guadalupe from which
Guadalupe County was later named after (Foster
1995; Smryl 2013).

Around 1000–750 B.P., slightly more xeric or
drought-prone climatic conditions returned to the
region and bison populations increased (Huebner
1991; Toomey 1993). Using this vast resource,
Toyah peoples were equipped with Perdiz pointtipped arrows, end scrapers, four-beveled-edge
knives, and plain bone-tempered ceramics. Toyah
technology and subsistence strategies represent a
completely different tradition from the preceding
Austin phase. Collins (1995:388) states that
formation of burned rock middens ceased as bison
hunting and group mobility reached a level not
witnessed since Folsom times. Although the
importance of bison hunting and high group
mobility hardly can be disputed, the argument that
burned rock midden development ceased during
the Toyah phase is tenuous. A recent examination
of Toyah-age radiocarbon assays and assemblages
by Black et al. (1997) suggests that their

SPANISH COLONIAL PERIOD (A.D. 1630–1820)
Motivated more by a fear of French expansion
than anything else, the Spanish explored and
established missions in eastern and central Texas
during the latter part of the seventeenth century
(Foster 1995). The first Europeans to pass near the

MEXICO AND THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS (1821–
1845)

project area were probably Spanish explorers and
missionaries with “sword and cross” coming
northward from Mexico City (Foster 1995;
Weddle 1968). With the exception of these
Spanish expeditions or entradas during the early
Historic Period, although claimed by Spain, Texas
lacked an established Spanish presence until
around A.D. 1700 (Foster 1995). These entrada
routes followed established Indian trade routes and
were the genesis of the Spanish road system
throughout Texas. These Spanish roads have been
incorporated into the Texas highway network that
is in use today (Foster 1995:1). Subsequent
overland entradas into the eighteenth century
generally followed de Léon’s early route, which
became the Upper Presidio Road from 1795–1850
(McGraw et al. 1991). This route generally
follows the IH 35 roadway, located northeast of
the project area.

The beginning of the nineteenth century proved
difficult for Spain. The Napoleonic wars left the
country in an economic and political crisis, which
was greatly felt in the territories of New Spain.
After years of struggle, threats from the United
States to the north and east, and the breakdown of
government organization, Mexico finally gained
its independence in 1821 (de la Teja 2011).
Ranching practices began to shift even more
during this time with an influx of new settlers
from the southern United States and Europe.
Under Spanish law, foreigners were initially
forbidden to settle in Spanish lands. However, due
to a dearth of settlers willing to travel into the
dangerous northern regions of New Spain, the
government made allowances. By 1820, Texas
was opened and settlers arrived in waves under the
authority of men like Stephen F. Austin, taking
advantage of cheap land and liberal laws under
Spain and then Mexico (Henson 2011). The
settlers’ influences added to methods of breeding
and herding practices in the area, building on
established Spanish colonial traditions. The
colonists also brought new crops and farming
practices with them. In fact, the anti-slavery ideals
of Mexico were set aside by Mexican officials in
Texas to lure Anglo settlers with the much-desired
agricultural practices from southern states. Settlers
also moved to Texas with the idea that the area
would soon be annexed by the United States and
would be a worthy investment as more people
moved west. Further, Texas functioned as a safe
haven from debt, granting debt-laden families and
individuals a clean start (Henson 2011).

Spanish expeditions throughout the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries established not only the
mission system but also introduced livestock and
ranching practices that would influence
generations of Texans. Sheep, goats, cattle, and
hogs were shipped in to create mission and private
ranches. These ranches were developed as a means
to create an autonomous settlement system in a
relatively hostile environment prone to attacks by
the Comanche, Apache, and Norteños.
By the end of the eighteenth century, ranching
practices were on the rise. Spurred on by demands
from eastern markets, Texas ranches flourished. In
addition, east Texas missions were secularized in
1794, creating a greater need for meat and other
goods (Freeman 1994). As a result of the changing
economic and political environment, the
proliferation of private ranches increased over
time. One of the first land grants issued by the
Spanish government in the Guadalupe County area
was to Jose de la Baume in 1806, in Capote Hills
(Smryl 2013). Eighteenth century Spanish
ranching practices were carried into the nineteenth
century, having an influence on European and
American settlers moving into Texas from both
Europe and the older states of the southeast.

By 1835, Texans were growing unhappy and
restless. The Mexican government had failed to
provide the liberal and democratic environment
that many European and American settlers had
envisioned. The republican ideals established in
the Constitution of 1824 were pushed aside and
replaced by a growing dictatorship lead by
Antonio López de Santa Anna. Texans decided to
handle the crisis swiftly by creating a series of
assemblies and a provisional government.
Wrought with internal strife, the Texans did not
fully organize until a convention meeting was held
9

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
of the Canyon Regional Water Authority Wells Ranch Crystal Clear Transmission Line Project

at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1, 1836.
The convention appointed Sam Houston as
commander-in-chief of the new Revolutionary
Army and made rapid decisions about a new
government, a new constitution, and the possibility
of war (Nance 2011).

community of Walnut Springs, which later became
Seguin in honor of Juan N. Seguin in 1839, was
founded by a group of former Texas Rangers in
1838, along the northeast bank of the Guadalupe
River (Smyrl 2013) and 10 miles west of the
project area.

The next several months would prove challenging
to the new government and Texas settlers. News
of the fall of the Alamo in early March 1836,
reached settlers quickly. South Central Texas was
one of the first areas affected by the news due to
close proximity to San Antonio. As Sam Houston
retreated in late March, settlers followed, creating
a large scale exodus out of Texas. Known as the
Runaway Scrape, the flight out of Texas continued
at a steady pace until the decisive Battle of San
Jacinto in late April. After Houston’s victory at
San Jacinto, settlers began to slowly make their
way back to their farms and ranches only to find
missing cattle and damaged property (Covington
2011).

The Republic of Texas also encouraged larger
settlements of new immigrants through land grants
and colonization contracts. These efforts garnered
varying levels of success, but at a minimum,
opened the door to a wave of German immigrants
into the region that would last throughout the years
of the nineteenth century and create important
cultural and social contributions to development of
the Texas Hill Country. Much of the northern and
western parts of the Guadalupe County were
settled by German immigrants in the 1840s due to
colonization efforts by Prince Carl of SolmsBraunfels at New Braunfels (Smyrl 2013).
ANTEBELLUM TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES
(1845–1861)

By late 1836, Texas had defeated Mexico, created
a new constitution, and elected a new executive,
judicial, and legislative staff. Sam Houston led the
new Republic of Texas as president and Stephen
F. Austin acted as secretary of state. The new
government worked quickly to create the Texas
postal system, create an organized militia, and
establish the Republic of Texas boundaries. Sam
Houston also worked with land grant issues and
settlers rights. By the end of the Texas Revolution,
Texas had more than 251,000,000 acres of land as
public domain. This land was not only used to
support public works in the new Republic of
Texas, but also to encourage further settlement.
Generous grants were provided to veterans of the
war. Land grants of 1,280 acres for heads of
families and 640 acres for single men were offered
to settlers arriving in Texas in 1836–1837. New
settlers were required to live in Texas at least 3
years to receive their land title (Nance 2011).
Texas also attempted to sell land to new settlers
well below the going rate at the time. Running into
organizational trouble with grants and sales, the
first homestead laws went into effect in 1839. This
law granted 50 acres or one town lot to every
citizen or head of family (Nance 2011). Texas
veterans of the revolution were given land within
Guadalupe County for their service in the war. The

In December 1845, Texas became part of the
United States. Texas would become a slave state
instead of a territory and also retain the ability to
keep public lands and debts. Texas would also
have the capability to divide into four additional
states if needed and the United States Navy would
offer protection along the Gulf coast. New
statehood created a flurry of activity and
settlement. Guadalupe County was initially
organized as a judicial county in 1842 by the
Republic of Texas, but was discontinued by the
Texas Supreme Court a year later. After
annexation, the present county was established
from parts of Bexar and Guadalupe counties in
March 1846 (Smyrl 2013).
German and Anglo-American settlers adapted
quickly to the new landscape. Breeding
experiments with native and imported goats and
sheep produced hybrid animals suited to the Hill
Country environment. Capitalizing on their
successful breeding experiments, German families
often built mills to produce cloth. This effort was
timed perfectly to meet an increased demand for
wool cloth over cotton within the larger context of
the United States. Wool manufacturing techniques
were also becoming more streamlined, enabling

majority of the established and growing AngloAmerican population came from southern states.
This group saw the Civil War and the election of
President Abraham Lincoln as a threat to the State
of Texas and its southern heritage and institutions
(Campbell 2011).

faster production. Further, low land prices and a
favorable climate lured ranchers from other parts
of the United States. These factors, in conjunction
with George Wilkins Kendall’s wool promotion
campaign activities, created the first sheep boom
in Texas. Cattle numbers were also on the rise and
by the onset of the Civil War; Texas had more
than 3.5 million head, outnumbering all other
states (Freeman 1994). In Guadalupe County,
livestock and harvests increased as well as a
shipping business, which improved the overall
economy (Smryl 2013).

Texas Hill Country counties were even more
divided with narrow margins winning in favor of
secession. At the Secession Convention held in
Austin in January 1861, Guadalupe County
approved the secession ordinance by a 314 to 22
margin. Nathanial Benton organized the first
Guadalupe County company to fight for the
Confederacy in 1861 (Smyrl 2013). However, the
vote against secession was led by the large number
of German settlers in the Hill Country west of
Guadalupe County. By 1861, Germans in Kerr,
Gillespie, and Kendall counties created the Union
League to organize groups to fight against local
native raids and Confederate threats. Seen as an
act of rebellion against the State of Texas and the
Confederacy, troops were called in to quell the
group. Finding themselves in a dangerous
situation, the Unionists decided to flee to Mexico.
They were intercepted and attacked by
Confederate troops on the Nueces River in Kinney
County in what is now known as the Battle of the
Nueces. While the division over succession and
the outcome of the Battle of Nueces (seen by
many German settlers as a massacre) created
tensions between Anglo and Germans even after
the Civil War was over, the counties in the Hill
Country recovered from the war quickly with
successful agriculture and ranching practices in
place for future growth (Odintz 2011).

Until the early twentieth century, transportation
and circulation routes in Texas remained
rudimentary and fairly disconnected. Spanish
Colonial roads took advantage of existing Native
American trails initially to access interior portions
of the territory. Later, settlers from the United
States and other European countries continued to
use established trails and created new ones as they
entered the region. By the early to mid-nineteenth
century, most of the roads in Texas were created
by sustained use and ease of access rather than by
design (Wallace 2008).
Efforts to create a coherent transportation system
began in the first years of the Republic of Texas.
The young Republic of Texas created a
Commissioner of Roads and Revenue along with
the Texas Rail Road Navigation and Banking
Company (Wallace 2008; Werner 2011). Lack of
funds plagued both, leaving existing roads in poor
condition with no hope for the establishment of
new circulation systems. Road development and
maintenance responsibility primarily fell to the
counties, which appointed a local overseer and
crew. This group of selected men, usually
comprised of local land owners, rotated every few
months. Therefore, road building in the early years
of the Republic of Texas and through the rest of
the nineteenth century was primarily a local
endeavor, shared by the community.

RECONSTRUCTION AND GROWTH (1865–1899)
The Hill Country counties and settlements
recovered quickly from the Civil War. As
mentioned above, throughout the United States,
George Wilkins Kendall promoted goat and sheep
ranching in Texas. As a result, the industries
survived the war and went on to create a second
wool or sheep boom through the mid-1880s. Key
factors influencing the success of sheep ranching
at this time included the influx of both northern
and southern ranchers to the area, the removal and
destruction of the bison herds along with native
populations to the west (allowing for new, open

THE CIVIL WAR (1861–1865)
Texas was a divided state as the Civil War began
in 1861. The new state had fought hard to be
granted admission to the Union, however, ties to
the older states of the south, including slavery and
agricultural practices, were strong. In fact, the

pastureland), and higher wool prices (Freeman
1994).

stage for the growth and boom of that industry into
the twentieth century (Freeman 1994).

However, in Guadalupe County there was an
economic decline right after the Civil War due to
the loss of taxable property, including slaves,
followed by declines in total farm acreage, farm
value, and livestock value. The construction of the
Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway
in the mid-1870s gave the county an economic
boost supplying residents much needed access to
markets. The towns of Marion, Cibolo, and
Schertz grew up along the railroad (Smyrl 2013).
Farmers could sell livestock without the risks of
cattle drives and they could also import fencing
supplies and heavy ginning machinery for the
cotton industry (Smyrl 2013).

THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY—
THE ADVANCEMENT OF RANCHING AND
INFRASTRUCTURE (1900–1940)

The development of ranching infrastructure also
helped establish the sheep, goat, and cattle
industries in the adjacent Hill Country. Railway
systems further aided ranching activities farther
west, creating access to the Edwards Plateau
(Freeman 1994). In fact, railroads would
eventually eclipse roads in focus and importance
as they pulled in funding from both the state and
outside resources. The Texas Railroad commission
was established in 1891 to regulate the powerful
railroad companies. By 1900, Texas had more
miles of track than any other state in the United
States; however, these lines still left much of the
expansive western half of Texas with little or no
rail access despite railroad growth (Werner 2011;
Wallace 2008).

As railways continued to be built well into the
twentieth century, new roads followed, creating a
linked network. Rails functioned as the “main
arteries of travel” and roads as “the veins” (Pratt
1910:106). Railroad companies soon realized that
a good road system could greatly aid their business
and they became one of the most ardent supporters
of the good roads movement (Wallace 2008).
Road systems also benefitted from the arrival of
post offices. The Rural Free Delivery (RFD) mail
system brought mail to isolated ranches and farms.
Postmen refused to use roads in poor conditions
and consistently reported conditions to the proper
authorities when they could not make their
deliveries. This system united rural roads and post
routes, engaging federal and state government
interests. This new level of involvement with
roads
and
their
development
stretched
significantly beyond the previous scope of county
court control (Wallace 2008).

Smaller, adept, diversified farms and ranches
dominated the landscape of the Edwards Plateau
by 1900. The “ranching triumvirate” of cattle,
sheep, and Angora goats set Texas at the national
forefront of ranching production (Freeman 1994:
18). Agricultural crops, such as cotton, corn,
wheat, oats, and various grasses for hay
production,
further
diversified
output,
strengthening independent farms and ranches
(Freeman 1994).

By the mid-1880s to early-1890s, the wool boom
and the cattle industry were in decline, brought on
by over-grazed grasslands; extreme weather
conditions, including drought and harsh winters;
and the introduction of barbed wire. In addition,
the Texas economy was heavily affected by the
Panic of 1893, which was a severe economic
depression brought on by bank failures and over
speculation in railroad construction. Sheep and
cattle ranchers generally pulled through,
reorganizing ranching practices and creating
support systems and organizations for protection
and promotion (Freeman 1994). Diversification of
ranching and farming also became more popular.
Ranchers focused their attention specifically on
mohair production and Angora goats, setting the

The fate of road improvement and system
expansion was sealed with the introduction of the
automobile and the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916
and Act 99 of 1917. The new acts provided
matching funding to states and a regulatory
partnership to assist with building plans (location,
design, and cost estimates). In response to these
acts, the Texas Highway Department was
established in 1917. Soon after, the Highway
Department would become the largest agency in
the state (Wallace 2008). By 1917, Texas was well
on its way to creating a new and complete

push for smaller, more diversified practices which
began in the early years of the twentieth century.

highway system. The system included several
national marked highway routes including the
nascent Old Spanish Trail Transcontinental
Highway (American Highway Association 1917;
Luther 2010).

THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY (1940S–1960S)
Goat, sheep, and cattle ranching remained in the
forefront of Texas Hill Country and Guadalupe
County commerce well into the mid-twentieth
century. Agricultural crop production of wheat,
sorghum, cotton, pecans, and oats continued on
farms and ranches. Schleicher County gained
prominence in the mohair industry with the
establishment of the West Texas Woolen Mills in
Eldorado during this time and became one of the
State’s most important wool processing centers
(Smyrl 2011).

Despite advancements made in infrastructure
technology and funding, ranching, and the nascent
tourism industry, the Great Depression took its toll
on the towns, farms, and ranches of the Texas Hill
Country. Because the area was primarily rural, the
effects of the depression were not felt initially.
However, by the early 1930s, changes occurred in
local economies. The Texas legislature responded
and in 1931, all state agencies were required to use
only American-made materials and machinery in
all new construction projects. The Texas Highway
Department worked together with the legislature to
ensure Texas firms and material suppliers received
all of the contracts for road and bridge work. As
the depression advanced, the state legislature and
the Texas Highway Department looked for other
ways to increase the number of jobs for out-ofwork Texans. In 1932, the Texas Highway
Department mandated that machines should be
used as a last result and all construction should be
conducted by hand when at all possible. In that
same year, Texas began to receive federal aid
under the Emergency Relief and Construction Act.
Funding continued under Roosevelt’s New Deal
Programs, which covered 100 percent of the costs
and aided in economic recovery throughout the
state (Wallace 2008).

New commercial opportunities rose in the oil and
gas industry throughout the region while road and
electrical infrastructure steadily improved. The
years of 1941 and early 1942 saw a boom period
for highway construction. World War II later
hampered efforts due to a decrease in supplies,
man power, and revenue from automobile
registration, but plans were made for the future. As
a result, delegates from the Texas Good Road
Association asked Washington for $768 million
for road repair due to neglect during the years of
the war. Congress responded with a $1.5 billion
dollar post-war highway bill. Texas received the
largest percentage of these funds. Due to this, by
the late 1940s, most of the roads in the Texas Hill
Country were paved and new construction projects
were completed in record time (Wallace 2008).

Farms and ranches also suffered during the
depression. A severe drought in the early 1930s
left many farms and ranches in decline. The
number of unemployed residents in the area also
increased, more than doubling between 1930 and
1936 (Thompson 2011). Smaller towns and less
populated counties also saw a dramatic population
decrease and people moved to larger towns to look
for work (Smyrl 2011). In Guadalupe County,
farmers had to devote more land to corn and
livestock due to low yields of cotton combined
with the Great Depression (Smyrl 2013). Many
farmers and tenants were forced out during this
period, with farms losing nearly 50 percent of their
value (Smyrl 2013). Despite the difficulties of the
depression, many ranches and farms survived with
lands and livestock intact. This is partly due to the

The smaller towns along the western edge of the
Hill Country attracted hunters and fishermen along
with other types of tourism. Tourism also greatly
influenced the steady population growth in the
region through the twentieth century (Thompson
2011; Smyrl 2011; Lich 2011). The Guadalupe
River was a source of hydroelectric power
developed in the 1920s and early 1930s and
privately owned dams channeled water to
generating plants, which provided electricity for
the surrounding area. Formed by dams, Lakes
Dunlap and McQueeny in Guadalupe County
became popular recreational sites and remain so
today (Smyrl 2013).

plotted using a global positioning system (GPS)
receiver, or on an aerial map, and each test was
recorded on appropriate project field forms. As
this was a non-collection survey, artifacts were
tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the field,
but not collected.

BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA performed a cultural resources file records
review to determine if the proposed APE has been
previously surveyed for cultural resources or if
any archaeological sites have been recorded within
or adjacent to the APE. To conduct this review, an
SWCA archaeologist reviewed portions of the
New Braunfels East USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle maps on the THC Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (Atlas). This resource provided
information on the nature and location of
previously conducted archaeological surveys,
previously recorded cultural resources, locations
of National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
properties, sites designated as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs), Official Texas Historical
Markers, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks,
cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys.
Aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology
Maps, and the NRCS Web Soil Survey were also
examined.
The
Texas
Department
of
Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay was
also reviewed to identify the presence of potential
historic-age structures.

SITE EVALUATIONS
All newly documented archaeological sites were
evaluated according to the National Register
Criteria for Evaluation (Criteria) as codified in 36
Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 60.4, which
states:

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCA’s investigations consisted of an intensive
pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations
within the project area. Archaeologists examined
the ground surface and erosional profiles and
exposures for cultural resources. Subsurface
investigations involved shovel testing in settings
with the potential to contain buried cultural
materials. Shovel tests were excavated at
systematic intervals determined by ground surface
visibility and soil deposition. Typically, a linear
project area would require 16 shovel tests per
mile. The 4.3-mile project area, therefore, would
require 69 shovel tests total. However, due to the
high ground surface visibility and extreme soil
disturbance from agricultural activity, shovel
testing frequency was reduced accordingly. A
shovel test measured roughly 30×30 centimeters
(cm) and was excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels
to 1 meter (m) in depth or to archaeologically
sterile subsoil. The matrix was screened through

limestone. The site was determined ineligible for
listing on the NRHP (Prikryl et al. 2010).

River Authority (LCRA), and for TxDOT and the
Farmers
Home
Administration
(FMHA).
Additionally, two previously recorded sites are
adjacent to the southwest portion of the project
area. Two previously conducted surveys and seven
previously recorded archaeological sites are
located within a 1-mile radius of the project area.

There are seven previously recorded sites
(41GU41, 41GU42, 41GU44, 41GU47, 41GU51,
41GU57, and 41GU150) within a 1-mile radius of
the project area (Atlas 2014). Five of the
previously recorded sites (41GU41, 41GU47,
41GU51, 41GU57, and 41GU150) are listed as
historic sites and include a cemetery (41GU41)
and Lake Dunlap Dam (41GU47). Lake Dunlap
was completed in 1928 and had a capacity of
5,900 acre-feet, a surface area of 406 acres and sits
at 575 feet above sea level (Atlas 2014). Sites
41GU42 and 41GU44 consist of a prehistoric
campsite and a multicomponent site, respectively
(Atlas 2014).

In 1989, a 5.75-mile linear survey on the
southwest end of the project area was conducted
on behalf of TxDOT along a portion of SH 46.
Additionally, a 1991 survey was completed on
behalf of the FMHA along the unnamed road
associated with the Lake Dunlap Dam. No further
information is available on Atlas for the 1989 or
1991 surveys (Atlas 2014).
In 2005, LCRA conducted a survey for the Clear
Springs Auto Transformer Project near the
southwestern end of the current project area. The
survey was reported in an annual report that is not
available on Atlas (2014). However, site 41BX87,
located adjacent to the current project area, was
first documented during the 2005 survey (Atlas
2014).

There are two previously conducted surveys
within 1 mile of the project area. A 1998 survey
completed by GBRA was conducted northnorthwest of the project area and a 2012 survey,
completed for New Braunfels Utilities, was
conducted southwest of the project area (Atlas
2014).

In 2008 and 2009, LCRA conducted a cultural
resources survey for the proposed Clear Springs to
Hutto Transmission Line. The survey extended 85
miles across portions of Williamson, Travis, Hays,
Caldwell, and Guadalupe Counties, and included
an additional 3.75 miles of rerouted corridor
segments. Sixty-two prehistoric and historic
cultural resource sites were identified during the
survey, four of which were prehistoric campsites
recommended as potentially eligible for listing as
an SAL (Prikryl et al. 2010).

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
A review of historic maps dating from 1921, 1927,
and 1958 indicate 13 to 19 historic-age resources
within or adjacent to the project area (Foster et al.
2006). A 1921 USACE map (Figure 3) depicts 15
structures and three wells within or adjacent to the
alignment, as well as three undeveloped roads and
numerous property fence lines that transect or
parallel the project line. Five structures are
illustrated within or adjacent to the alternative
route. A 1927 USGS map (Figure 4) depicts seven
structures within or adjacent to the 4.3-mile
alignment and two structures on the alternative
route. No property fence lines are illustrated on the
1927 map, but multiple developed and
undeveloped roads are depicted as transecting the
project area. A 1958 Army Map Services (AMS)
map (Figure 5) depicts seven residential buildings
and five outbuildings within or adjacent to the

Archaeological sites 41GU43 and 41GU87 are
located immediately adjacent to the southwestern
portion of the project area. Site 41GU43 was
recorded in 2000 during a survey for the
Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority’s (GBRA’s)
San Marcos Raw Water pipeline (Atlas 2014).
Recorded as an early-twentieth-century farmstead,
the barn is located on the private property on the
south side of SH 46. The barn was recommended
as ineligible for listing on the NRHP (Atlas 2014).
Site 41GU87 was recorded during the pedestrian
survey for the Clear Springs Auto Transformer
Project in 2005 by LCRA (Prikryl et al. 2010).

Geronimo Creek (Figure 10) is a shallow swale
with no well-defined bed channel located near the
medial portion of the project area. The unnamed
tributary of the Guadalupe River, located on the

alignment and two residential buildings and three
outbuildings along the alternative route. Only a
partial undeveloped road is illustrated on the 1958
map, along with multiple developed roads
paralleling or transecting the project line. Given
the known history of the New Braunfels area, the
project area has a high potential to contain historic
resources, either as standing structures or as
archaeological remains.

The soils of the alignment consist mainly of very
dark gray, dark grayish brown, and black clay
loams mixed with 5–20 percent chert gravels. Clay
loam deposits range from 30 to 60 cm below
ground surface (cmbs) before terminating at
compact basal clay subsoils. Chert cobble and
gravel outcrops were observed on the ground
surface throughout the project area. Due to recent
plowing and planting activity, ground surface
visibility was 100 percent. Recent storm activity
left semi-moist soils in the upland portions of the
project area and super-saturated soils (Figure 12)
within and adjacent to the swale drainages.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
On October 31, 2013, and October 2 and 16, 2014,
SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive
archaeological survey with shovel testing of the
proposed 4.3-mile Crystal Clear Alignment.
Investigations for the 2.7-mile original alternative
route were conducted on October 29, 2013, but the
alternative route was abandoned after the initial
investigation. The survey determined that a
majority of the project area is located within
highly disturbed agricultural land. One isolated
find was recorded on the northeast end of the
project area. Additionally, one archaeological site,
41GU167, was recorded on the northeast end of
the abandoned alternative route but was not found
to extend into the final alignment. No evidence of
previously recorded sites 41GU43 and 41GU87
were documented within the project area.

Major disturbances throughout the alignment are
the result of agricultural activity, such as plowing
and planting. Other disturbances consist of a
network of property fence lines (Figure 13),
existing transmission lines, graded ditches along
field boundaries for flood control, and
undeveloped dirt roads (Figure 14) for field
access. Barbarosa Road (Figure 15), Dauer Ranch
Road, Old Seguin Road and Avery Parkway all
transect or parallel small segments of the project
area and consists of asphalt paved roads with
graded rights-of-way (ROWs).

CRYSTAL CLEAR ALIGNMENT
Field investigations of the Crystal Clear
Alignment
encountered
a
mostly
rural
environment consisting of large agricultural fields
and undeveloped parcels along much of the APE
(Figure 6 and 7). Vegetation was limited to
agricultural crops, such as corn and sorghum
(Figure 8), as well as sporadic clusters of grasses
and low shrubs along the borders of agricultural
fields and drainage channels. The topography of
the project area consists of relatively flat upland
formations gently carved by Alligator Creek, an
unnamed tributary of Geronimo Creek, and an
unnamed tributary of the Guadalupe River.
Alligator Creek is a 3-foot-wide, 6-foot-deep
stream channel located on the northeast end of the
project area. The bed channel is flanked by a light
vegetation of sporadic hardwood trees and light

A total of 50 shovel tests were conducted along
the Crystal Clear Alignment. The THC standards
required a total of 69 shovel tests for the 4.3-mile
alignment; however, 90 to 100 percent ground
surface visibility greatly reduced the number of
shovel tests warranted. Shovel tests were
conducted in 120- and 200-m intervals determined
by the level of ground surface visibility, with the
exception of one area. A 900-m segment of the
southwest portion of the line, parallel to an
existing subdivided residential development, was
not shovel tested due to super-saturated soils. This
area was instead thoroughly inspected for cultural
material on the ground surface though visual
examination. Shovel tests ranged from 15 to 60
cmbs, and consisted of clay loam soils with gravel
and calcium carbonate inclusions over basal clay
subsoils.

Figure 14. Example of undeveloped dirt road for
field access, facing northeast.

One isolated find (IF), IF01, was identified though
ground surface inspection to the south of a dense
chert cobble outcrop. IF01 is a unifacial tool
modified from a primary chert flake (Figure 16).
No other cultural materials were observed within
the vicinity of IF01, thus the find was not recorded
as an archaeological site.
The background review determined that two
previously recorded archaeological sites were
located within or immediately adjacent to the
alignment: 41GU43 and 41GU87. However,
investigations determined that both previously
recorded sites are located outside of the project
area boundaries. Shovel testing and ground surface
inspection confirmed that no cultural materials or
features associated with sites 41GU43 and
41GU87 extended into the project area. Two
historic structures (labeled HSS01 and HSS02 on
Figure 6) associated with 41GU43 were visible
across SH 46 from the project area (Figure 17).

Figure 15. Road right-of-way (left) paralleling
project area, facing south.

Overall, the Crystal Clear Alignment was found to
be highly disturbed from agricultural activity, as
well as the construction of property fence lines,
transmission lines, graded drainage ditches,
undeveloped dirt access roads, and paved road
ROWs. One archaeological site, 41GU167, was
recorded during the 4.3-mile alignment survey.

Major disturbances throughout the project area are
the result of agricultural activity, such as plowing
and planting. Other disturbances consisted of a
network of property fence lines, existing
transmission lines, and undeveloped dirt roads for
field access. Small segments of Dauer Ranch Road
(Figure 21) and Barbarosa Road parallel the
northeastern end of the reroute project area and
consist of asphalt paved roads with graded ROWs.

CRYSTAL CLEAR ALTERNATIVE ROUTE
Survey investigations of the 2.7-mile abandoned
Crystal Clear Alternative Route (Figure 18) also
encountered a mostly rural environment consisting
of large agricultural fields and undeveloped
parcels. The topography of the project area
consists of fairly level, featureless landscapes with
Alligator Creek to the northeast and an unnamed
tributary of Geronimo Creek to the southwest.
Vegetation was limited to plowed and planted corn
and hay fields (Figure 19).

A total of 32 shovel tests were conducted along
the alternative route in 200-m intervals due to high
ground surface visibility. Areas of 100 percent
visibility did not warrant shovel testing. Shovel
tests ranged from 25 to 60 cmbs, and consisted of
clay soils with gravel inclusions over compact
basal clay subsoils. One shovel test was positive
for cultural material, resulting in the recording of
archaeological site 41GU167.

The soils of the alternative route consist mainly of
very dark gray and black clays mixed with 2 to 10
percent gravels. Clay deposits range from 10 to 60
cmbs before terminating at compact basal clay
subsoils. Chert cobble and gravel outcrops were
also observed on the ground surface throughout
the project area and are likely the result of
consistent agricultural plowing. Due to recent
plowing and planting activity, ground surface
visibility was 90 to 100 percent (Figure 20).

SITE 41GU167
Site 41GU167 is a historic refuse scatter located
on the northeast end of the abandoned alternative
route (Figure 22). The site is located within a
plowed agricultural field overlooking Alligator
Creek 0.14 mile to the east. The topography of the
site is generally level with a less than 5 percent
slope to the east towards the drainage. The
surrounding agricultural field had been recently
plowed, affording 100 percent ground surface
visibility (Figure 23). Soils consisted of clay loams
that ranged from 40 to 55 cm in depth, mixed with
chert cobbles and gravels. Abundant chert cobbles
were also observed on the ground surface.

Figure 19. Example of hay field vegetation and
ground surface visibility, facing northeast.

Site 41GU167 measures 15 m north to south by
250 to 300 m east to west. The north to south site
boundaries were determined by the project area
ROW, as well as a private fence line to the south.
The east to west site boundaries were determined
by the extent of the surficial scatter. A total of four
shovel tests were excavated within the site, only
one of which (SS04) was positive for cultural
material. Subsurface deposits within SS04
consisted of one metal fragment observed at 0 to
10 cmbs. Additional investigations within the
Crystal Clear Alignment APE 150 m to the north
and west determined that site 41GU167 does not
extend into the project area.
Cultural material for site 41GU167 consists of
predominately historic materials, although a few
prehistoric materials were documented. Materials
include: one ceramic marble (Figure 24); 18-plus
plain whiteware sherds; one decorative whiteware
sherd; one stoneware sherd; 18+ clear glass
shards; seven clear window glass shards; abundant
solarized (amethyst), brown, and aqua vessel glass
shards (Figure 25); and metal fragments (Figure
26). Artifacts were observed to be evenly
dispersed and no concentration or features were
documented. One biface (Figure 27) and two
fragments of burned rock were also documented
within the site boundaries of 41GU167, but no
additional prehistoric materials or features were
observed.

Site 41GU167 does not meet Criteria A, B, or C of
36CFR60.4, but SWCA evaluated the site for
eligibility under Criterion D, which considers its
ability to yield information important in prehistory
or history. Site 41GU167 is a surficial historic
refuse scatter of an unknown temporal affiliation.
No diagnostic artifacts were recovered during
investigations and only one positive shovel test
produced shallow subsurface materials at 0 to 10
cmbs. The land use for the project area has been
agricultural cultivation for an extended period of
time, indicating that extensive disturbances have
heavily impacted the site. No cultural features are
clearly indicated.

(41GU43 and 41GU87) are adjacent to the
southwest portion of the project area. Two
previously conducted surveys and seven
previously recorded archaeological sites are
located within a 1-mile radius of the project area.
A review of historic maps dating from 1921 and
1958 indicate there were several historic-age
resources within or adjacent to the proposed
alignment.

Overall, site 41GU167 does not have the potential
to yield information important to the history of the
region following potential research avenues and
outlines of the cultural context. The site lacks
substantial intact subsurface deposits, a substantial
artifact assemblage, and isolable activity areas.
Due to its lack of potential research value,
41GU167 is not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
No further work or avoidance strategy is
recommended for the site. The site will be avoided
by the final Crystal Clear Alignment.

Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed
that the proposed project area is within a rural
setting intersected by fence lines, overhead utility
lines, existing underground utilities, and road
ways. Almost the entire APE consisted of plowed
field affording 90 to 100 percent ground visibility.
A total of 50 shovel tests were excavated within
the available APE. Shovel tests were excavated to
depths ranging from 30 to 60 cmbs and consisted
of clay and clay loam. The THC’s survey
standards for projects of this size recommend 16
shovel tests per linear mile when the ROW
measures less than 100 feet wide, or 69 shovel
tests for the current project area. Due to high
ground surface visibility and previous disturbances
within the APE, SWCA reduced the number of
shovel tests as subsurface exploration was not
warranted in certain areas. One isolated find was
encountered within the northeast portion of the
project area. No evidence of previously recorded
sites 41GU43 and 41GU87 were documented
within the project area. One archaeological site,
41GU167, was documented during survey
investigations of the abandoned alternative route,
but does not extend into the final Crystal Clear
Alignment.

CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of River City Engineering and CRWA,
SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey for the Wells Ranch Crystal Clear
Transmission Line in Guadalupe County, Texas.
The work was conducted as part of the sponsor’s
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
(Permit Number 6678) and the NHPA in
anticipation of a permit from the USACE-Fort
Worth District under Nationwide Permit 12 and
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The project
area is located 3.5 miles northwest of Geronimo,
Texas, between SH 46 and FM 758.
The CRWA proposes to replace and install a new
16-inch-diameter water main line within existing
CRWA easements, other utility easements, and
private property. Installation of the pipeline will
require trenching and boring within a 50-foot-wide
construction easement. Typically, trenching
impacts would be 6 to 7 feet deep, while bore pits
would be 8 to 10 feet deep. The area of potential
effects (APE) is a 4.3-mile alignment. During the
course of the project, approximately 2.7 miles of
the alignment was rerouted after the original route
was surveyed. The 2.7-mile alternative route was
ultimately abandoned. The total APE for the
Crystal Clear project area is 26 acres.

In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has
made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
cultural resources properties within the APE. As
no properties were identified that may meet the
criteria for listing in the NRHP according to 36
CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL, according
to 13 TAC 26.8, SWCA recommends no further
cultural resources work within the project area.

The investigations included a background review
and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel
testing of the project area boundaries. The
background review determined that two small
portions of the project area have been previously
surveyed by LCRA, TxDOT, and FMHA.
Additionally, two previously recorded sites
