ABSTRACT
On April 22, 24, and 25, 2019 personnel from POWER Engineers, Inc. (POWER) performed an
intensive archeological survey of portions of the proposed CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric
Jones Creek Distribution Line Rebuild Project in Brazoria County, Texas. Most of the survey was
undertaken in Texas Department of Transportation right-of-way (ROW) along State Highway 36 and
included areas near potential United States Army Corps of Engineers-Galveston District (USACE)
jurisdictional areas. The investigation was undertaken under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8875 and
in support of USACE Nationwide Permit 12. Approximately 26.3 acres were surveyed, consisting of
3.9 miles of 50-foot-wide distribution line ROW. No cultural resources were recorded during the
survey. Due to the lack of cultural materials in the project area, POWER recommends that
construction activities within the project area be allowed to proceed without further consultation. If,
during construction of the distribution line cultural resources are encountered, all activities at the
location should be halted until the Texas Historical Commission (THC) is notified and an appropriate
course of action is determined. All materials produced as part of this project (original field notes,
maps, drawings, photos, artifacts, etc.) will be prepared and submitted for curation as required by the
Texas Antiquities Permit-Terms and Conditions, and Texas Administrative Code Title 13, pt. 2, Ch.
26.C26.17. We intend to curate these materials with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), and upon completion of the project, a curation form will accompany the complete
collections to TARL and to the THC.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric (CEHE) proposes to rebuild the 9.2-mile-long Jones Creek
Distribution Line (Project). In accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas, personnel from
POWER Engineers, Inc. (POWER) performed an archeological survey of portions of the Project
including portions on state-owned Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) right-of-way
(ROW). The survey included approximately 47.2 acres along 3.9 miles of the up to 50-foot-wide
ROW. The survey was undertaken on April 22, 24, and 25, 2019 in partial fulfillment of Texas
Antiquities Permit No.8875 and to support United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
permitting. Archeologists Emily Duke M.A., RPA and Samuel Dillon, M.A., RPA, performed the
surface and subsurface (i.e., shovel tests) survey for the proposed Project. Ms. Duke and Mr. Dillon
meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualifications Standards for Archeology (48 Federal
Register 22716 or 36 Code of Federal Regulations Part 61).

2.0

INTRODUCTION

CEHE proposes to rebuild the approximately 9.2-mile-long Jones Creek 12 kilovolt (kV)
Distribution Line in Brazoria County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed Project includes:
•

•

Rebuild of an approximately 5.2-mile long 12 kV distribution line, originating near the
intersection of State Highway (SH-) 36 and Old Brazos River Road and terminating near the
intersection of Old Brazos River Road and Farm to Market Road 2004. Construction
activities will include replacing pole for pole within a construction ROW ranging from 5 to
20 feet wide, matting over drainage ditches, and line stringing and tensioning.
New construction of approximately a 3.9-mile long 12 kV distribution line originating at the
intersection of Stephen F. Austin Road and SH-36 and terminating at the Jones Creek
Substation. Project construction activities will include clearing where necessary within a 50foot-wide construction corridor, matting, foundation construction, pole erection, and line
stringing/tensioning.

Approximately 4.7 miles of the proposed rebuild is in TxDOT ROW. POWER recommended that no
archeological survey is warranted for the pole-for-pole rebuild portion of the Project, as impacts will
be limited to the existing distribution line ROW and excavations will be limited to previously
impacted areas (existing distribution line pole locations). The Texas Historical Commission (THC)
agreed, and POWER archeologists surveyed the approximately 3.9 miles of proposed new
construction, the majority of which is in TxDOT ROW.
In accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeologists from POWER surveyed
approximately 26.3 acres of the proposed new construction, including the proposed ROW on TxDOT
ROW (Figures 1 and 2). The survey was undertaken in partial fulfilment of Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 8875. Construction of the new distribution line will include clearing where necessary within an
approximately 50-foot-wide construction corridor, construction of the monopole distribution line
structures, and stringing the conductor and shield wires. Clearing should be minimal since the
TxDOT ROW has already been cleared and is maintained. It is anticipated that 24-inch-diameter
holes will be excavated with an auger to between 7 and 10 feet deep to set the approximately 60-foottall monopoles. No laydown yards, access roads, or creek disturbances are proposed.
The Project is mapped within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a subset of the larger
Eastern Planning Region as delineated by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). The Project is
included in Perttula’s Southeast Texas archeological region (Perttula 2004a).

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The proposed Project is within the Coastal Prairies sub-province of the Gulf Coastal Plains
Physiographic Region of Texas (Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG] 1996). The Coastal Prairies
Region extends inland from the Texas Gulf Coast and is characterized by young deltaic sands, silts
and clays, creating nearly flat grasslands (BEG 1996). Elevations within the Project area range from
less than five to 16 feet above mean sea level. The Project area is underlain by Quaternary-aged
alluvium, which flanks most creeks and streams in the region (BEG 1982 and 1987).
Velasco, Pledger, Surfside, Asa, Brazoria and Norwood, and Ijam series soils are mapped within the
Project (Crenwelge et al. 1981). Surfside and Velasco series soils are found in coastal marshes and
have a low-moderate geoarcheological potential (Abbot 2001). These two soil series are mapped, for
the most part, in the rebuild portion of the Project. All the remaining series soils are found on
floodplains. Asa and Norwood series soils, both mapped in the new construction part of the Project on
the Brazos River floodplain, have high geoarcheological potential (Abbott 2001). Pledger and
Brazoria series soils, both vertisols, have moderate geoarcheological potential due to the mixing of
deposits caused by shrinking and swelling of these soils (Abbott 2001). Ijam series soils, formed from
materials dredged from rivers, bays, and canals, have no geoarcheological potential (Abbott 2001).

3.1

Cultural Background

The Project is within the Southeastern Archeological Region, a subset of the larger Eastern Planning
Region as delineated by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Very generally, the sequence of
recognized archeological manifestations in southeast Texas has been divided into three periods:
Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric or Ceramic periods. These cultural periods are roughly
equivalent to broad patterns of environmental change, described by Aten (1983). These patterns are
the Late Glacial (12,000 to 9,000 years before present [B.P.]), post-Pleistocene adaptations that
resulted in a shift in economic orientation and an increasing population (9,000 to 3,000 B.P.), and,
lastly, essentially modern environmental conditions which developed approximately 3,000 B.P.
Ricklis (2004) proposes a prehistoric cultural sequence for southeast Texas consisting of four
occupational periods: Paleoindian (ca. 11,500 to 8,000 B.P., Archaic (ca. 8,000 to 1,500 B.P. [inland],
5,000 to 2,220 B.P. [coastal]), and the Ceramic Period (ca. 2,000 to 300 B.P.).

Paleoindian Period
The earliest well-established human occupations of North America are archeologically referred to as
Paleoindian. Isolated Paleoindian chipped stone projectile points, typed as Clovis, have been found on
the upper Texas coast in surficial or mixed contexts (Hester 1980; Patterson 1980; Wheat 1953).
Story et al. (1990) summarized the distribution and context of Paleoindian remains in southeast Texas
and found that except for well inland of the modern coastline, Paleoindian artifacts on the upper
Texas coast are from disturbed or secondary contexts.
Aten (1983:116-117) estimates that during the Paleoindian period, the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico
was between 30 and 40 kilometers seaward of its present location. Woodlands apparently covered
much of the upper Texas coast and probably extended onto the now submerged continental shelf.
Most of the archeological sites dating to this period may lie offshore, be deeply buried in the terraces
of major streams, or have been obliterated by Holocene erosion (Abbot 2001; Hester 1980). Because
such limited data exist for the Paleoindian period in this area, only certain assumptions can be made
regarding Paleoindian cultural development in the region. The presence of large projectile points
suggests that hunting large mammals was undoubtedly an important component of the subsistence
strategy, although a collection of readily available plant foods probably also contributed to the diet
(Collins 2002). Environmental changes that brought about the extinction or dislocation of

PAGE 15

POWER ENGINEERS, INC.
Jones Creek Rebuild Project – Cultural Resource Survey

Rancholabrean megafauna triggered a shift away from Paleoindian adaptations toward a broad-based
subsistence orientation termed Archaic (Aten 1983; Willey and Phillips 1958).

Archaic Period
Probably the most prominent characteristic of the Archaic period is that it epitomizes the foraging
lifestyle. The Archaic period on the upper Texas coast is marked by sea-level rise and climatic
fluctuation in the middle to late Holocene, from ca. 9,000 to 1,850 B.P. (Aten 1983). Ricklis (2004)
frames the Archaic period in southeast Texas in terms of inland and coastal adaptations. Inland, the
Archaic period generally extended from 8,000 to 1,500 years ago. Numerous sites dating to this
period have been found along primary streams throughout the region and contain stone projectile
points that are diverse and reduced in size from the earlier Paleoindian period. These dart points also
tend to be made of poorer quality local resources suggesting reduced group mobility and tighter group
territories. A lack of faunal and botanical remains at inland archeological sites precludes inferring
more than a generalized hunting and gathering subsistence system.
Well-established cemeteries also appear in the archeological record of inland southeast Texas by the
middle Archaic (ca. 6,000 to 3,000 B.P.) (Ricklis 2004; Story 1985). Excavation of 41AU36 on the
lower Brazos River revealed a cemetery in use from the middle Archaic through the early Ceramic
period (Hall 1981). By the late Archaic (ca. 3,000 to 1,500 B.P.), cemeteries increased substantially in
size and most burials contain a diverse array of grave goods (Ricklis 2004). Story (1985) suggests that
the abundance of cemeteries on the western margin of the coastal prairie zone indicates increased
territoriality among groups in response to an ever-increasing population. Hall (2000) posits that
highly productive environments such as river valley bottoms and the floodplains of major streams
were home to an aggregate of resources that were predictable, concentrated, and fixed on the
landscape. Such resources allowed late Archaic groups to operate within smaller, more exclusive
territories.
The Archaic period on the upper Texas coast extended from about 5,000 to 2,200 years ago (Ricklis
2004). However, very few intact early Archaic components are known from this region and Aten
(1983) and Story (1985) suggest the inland margin of the coastal plain may have been occupied more
intensely than the coast as sea levels rose during the early Archaic. The coastline reached its current
location between 7,000 and 5,000 B.P. (Aten 1983) and the earliest known shell middens in the area
date to this period (Howard et al. 1991). Coastal Archaic sites that have been tested or excavated near
the modern shoreline generally consist of shell-bearing sites with lithic tools and debitage, shell and
bone tools, and the bones of fish, mammals, and reptiles (Story 1985).
Beginning around 3,000 years ago, subsistence systems increasingly focused on coastal zone
resources (Aten 1983; Story et al. 1990), following the establishment of relatively stable sea levels
and essentially modern, highly productive estuaries (Ricklis 2004). Aten (1979 and 1983)
hypothesized the establishment of seasonal rounds, including regular movements from littoral to
inland areas during the late Archaic. Historic native groups have been demonstrated to move in a
yearly round in dispersed band-sized or smaller groups during the warm seasons, shifting to
aggregated villages during the colder months (Aten 1979; Newcomb 1961).

Early Ceramic Period
Ceramic manufacture first appeared in southeast Texas along the coast around 2,000 years ago
ushering in the Early Ceramic period. Based on stylistic elements and the progressively earlier dated
occurrences as one moves eastward, ceramics arrived in the region via diffusion from Louisiana or
the Lower Mississippi River Valley, suggesting an increasing interregional influence from
neighboring groups (Aten 1979; Ricklis 2004). There were no apparent major shifts in lifeways

PAGE 16

POWER ENGINEERS, INC.
Jones Creek Rebuild Project – Cultural Resource Survey

during the early years after ceramics were introduced. The contents of shell-bearing sites along the
upper Texas coast during the Early Ceramic period vary little from the late Archaic shell middens,
except for the addition of pottery and a few evolving dart point types, primarily Gary and Kent types
(Ricklis 2004). Discrete cemeteries located close to major streams continue to enforce the notion of
well-established group territories in response to increasing populations first evident during the
Archaic (Aten 1983). Ceramics appeared in inland southeast Texas several centuries later (Aten 1979:
425) and most likely disseminated from the coastal zone where sandy-paste wares had become
commonplace (Ricklis 2004).

Late Prehistoric Period
Around 1,300 years ago, small, light, straight and expanded stem arrow points began to appear in
archeological assemblages, indicating the introduction of the bow and arrow – a hallmark of the Late
Prehistoric period in southeast Texas. Findings at the Mitchell Ridge site on Galveston Island suggest
that the Late Prehistoric period in the region can be divided into two sub-periods. The initial Late
Prehistoric is associated with the introduction of the bow and arrow as evidenced primarily by the
presence of Scallorn arrow points. The final Late Prehistoric period in southeast Texas correlates with
changes taking place throughout much of Texas. These changes include the appearance of bison bone
in archeological assemblages around 700 to 800 years ago in association with a variety of stone tools.
Stone tools associated with the appearance of bison include Perdiz arrow points, thin bifacial knives,
expanded base drills and perforators, and unifacial end scrapers. The occurrence of bison bone with
these tools suggests a significant shift towards reliance on bison and other large game hunting and the
processing of meat and hides (Ricklis 2004).
Ceramics in the region continued to evolve during the Late Prehistoric period. Grog tempering is
introduced near the end of the Early Ceramic, approximately A.D. 1000 (Aten 1979: 395-398; Ricklis
2004). Bone-tempering, although rare, appears later, and decorative elements become more elaborate
(Ricklis 2004). The change in external design elements along the upper Texas coast reflect those of
various types of the Coles Creek-Plaquemine sequence occurring in coastal Louisiana and the Lower
Mississippi River Valley, suggesting a continued interaction with groups from the east (Ricklis 2004).
Caddo influences are apparent in Late Prehistoric ceramic assemblages east near Conroe and
Livingston (Ricklis 2004).

Historic Period
European contact in the region began in the early sixteenth century with the landing of Cabeza de
Vaca and his ill-fated party on the Texas coastline in 1528. It is believed that his party crossed Oyster
Creek, Old Caney Creek, and the Brazos and San Bernard rivers in their quest for provisions. More
long-term contacts resulting from permanent European settlement did not directly impact aboriginal
lifeways in southeast Texas until the early eighteenth century (Patterson 1995), although diseases
introduced by explorers and early traders had begun to affect Native American populations in Texas
by the sixteenth century (Ewers 1974). Skirmishes with colonists resulted in the expulsion of most of
the native population by 1850 (Kleiner 2019a).
Anglo-American settlement in the Brazoria County areas began in the early 1820s, with the arrival of
89 families of Austin’s Old Three Hundred (Kleiner 2019a and 2019b). The earliest settlements
included Velasco (present-day Surfside), Bell’s Landing (East Columbia), Columbia, and Brazoria
(Kleiner 2019a). Samuel Damon built a home on the south side of Damon Mound between 1834 and
1836, and like many Brazoria County residents, he played important roles in the Texas Revolution
(Damon II 2019). In May of 1836, Velasco became the seat of the provisional government of the
Republic of Texas.

PAGE 17

POWER ENGINEERS, INC.
Jones Creek Rebuild Project – Cultural Resource Survey

Columbia served as the capital of the Republic when sessions of the first Texas Congress met in
October 1836, during which Brazoria County was established as one of the first 23 counties in Texas
(Kleiner 2019a and 2019b). The present boundaries of Brazoria County were established with the
creation of Fort Bend and Galveston Counties in 1837 and 1838.
As early as the mid-1830s, cotton farms in Brazoria County produced more than 5,000 bales annually,
and plantation owners in the area became some of the wealthiest in Texas. Cotton and sugar
plantations in the county relied heavily on slaveholding, and by 1860, Brazoria County had 2,027
whites, 5,110 black slaves, and six free black residents (Kleiner 2019a). Brazoria voted overwhelming
for secession (Kleiner 2019a). The Union blockade of the Texas coast severely damaged the economy
blocking cotton from distant markets. Production of cotton did not bounce back from this wartime
decline until after 1870. During Reconstruction, the Ku Klux Klan was active in the area (Kleiner
2019a). White vigilantes from Brazoria and surrounding counties attacked Vann Settlement, a black
settlement, in 1887, in one of the most violent incidents perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan in the area
(Kleiner 2019b).
The economy of Brazoria County suffered after the Civil War. Principal crops in the county
diversified to include corn, grains, sweet and Irish potatoes, fruits, wild grapes, cotton, and sugar.
Convict labor replaced slave labor, but sugar production never rebounded to its earlier levels. Cattle
have become increasingly important to the local economy since the 1870s. Oil production began in
Brazoria County in the 1900s, and sulfur began to be mined in 1912. Since then, extractive industries
have played a major role in the local economy. Manufacturing jobs increased in importance following
the establishment of Dow Chemical in 1941 (Kleiner 2019a).
Previous Investigations
POWER conducted a review of records available online from the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (TASA) (THC 2019) on April 15, 2019 to determine if previously recorded archeological sites,
cemeteries, Official Texas Historical Markers, or National Register of Historic Places (NHRP)
historic properties and districts are recorded within one mile of the Project.
The review indicated 16 archeological sites are located within one mile of the Project. Twelve of the
archeological sites are shell-bearing prehistoric campsites. Shell middens are recorded at 41BO35,
41BO111, 41BO113, 41BO129, 41BO130, 41BO131, 41BO132, 41BO140, 41BO142, 41BO193,
and 41BO211, and a surface scatter of shell is reported at 41BO112. Ceramics, bone, and debitage are
also reported from most of these sites. Site 41BO140 also contains an historic component, the remains
of the J.P. Bryan homestead and associated ferry and commercial landing. This multicomponent site
is the only site that has been formally assessed for listing on the NRHP and has been determined
eligible for listing on the NRHP. Sites 41BO141 and 41BO227 are historic sites. Site 41BO141 is a
scatter of handmade bricks, and 41BO227 is a historic ranching complex including a rock and mortar
trough, two metal water tanks, and a rock-lined cistern/water catchment. Three mounds that are
thought to be a Confederate gun battery dating to 1862 are recorded at site 41BO226. No descriptive
information is available for site 41BO36. Due to their distance from the proposed Project, no impacts
are anticipated for any of the recorded sites.
There are four cemeteries within one mile of the Project: the Eastern Branch cemetery, Oakland
Cemetery (also known as the Overcoming Faith cemetery), the Hagerman cemetery, and the Jones
Family cemetery. None have been designated Historic Texas Cemeteries. One Official Texas
Historical Marker is mapped within one mile of the Project. The Stringfellow Ranch marker
commemorates Robert Edward Lee Stringfellow, who by 1890, owned a cattle ranch and meat market
that served jetty workers at the mouth of the Brazos River. He was a civic leader and philanthropist
who helped build and invest in the Freeport (THC 2019).

Seventeen previous archeological investigations are mapped within one mile of the Project (THC
2019). These investigations date to as early as 1976, and include investigations undertaken for the
USACE, Texas Parks and Wildlife, and the Brazoria Water Authority (THC 2019) and in advance of
projects at the Lake Jackson Marine Fish Hatchery (Davis 1992), the Buffalo Camp Bayou
Recreational Facility (Weaver et al. 2003), Surfside Beach Boat Ramp Facility (McWilliams and
Boyd 2007), and the Brazosport Water Authority Water Treatment Plant (Shipp et al. 2015).
Descriptive information is not available for some of the investigations mapped near the Project.

RESEARCH DESIGN

To comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas and support USACE Nationwide Permit (NWP 12) –
Utility Line Activities, the new build portions of the proposed Project were surveyed for cultural
resources. The objective of the survey was to identify prehistoric and historic cultural resources
within the Project area that could be adversely affected by the construction of the distribution line
and, to the extent possible based on survey-level data, assess the potential of such resources for
designation as a State Antiquities Landmark or for listing on the NRHP. Survey methods followed the
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas established by the THC.
The entirety of the proposed new construction ROW was pedestrian-surveyed to identify surface
scatters and above ground non-archeological cultural resources. Shovel testing was conducted to
determine the presence of any subsurface cultural resources within the ROW. Shovel tests were
excavated at a 100-meter interval except in instances where POWER biologists had previously
mapped potentially USACE jurisdictional features. At these potentially jurisdictional areas, at the
discretion of the Principal Investigator, shovel tests were excavated at smaller intervals.
All soil matrices were sifted through 6.3-millimeter (0.25-inch) mesh hardware cloth unless the
matrix was dominated by clay. Clayey matrix was finely divided by hand and visually inspected.
Descriptions of the soils encountered during the shovel tests were recorded on standardized shovel
test logs, and each shovel test was plotted with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
All shovel tests were backfilled after they were excavated and recorded.
Had any artifacts or features been encountered, the proposed archeological investigations would have
utilized a no-collection strategy. Diagnostic materials, if observed, would have been documented in
the field and returned to where they were located. All materials produced as part of this project
(original field notes, maps, drawings, photos, artifacts, etc.) will be prepared and submitted for
curation as required by the Texas Antiquities Permit-Terms and Conditions, and Texas
Administrative Code Title 13, pt. 2, Ch. 26.C26.17. We intend to curate these materials with the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), and upon completion of the project, a curation
form will accompany the complete collections to TARL and to the THC.

RESULTS

A review of the THC’s TASA database did not indicate any previously recorded archeological sites
within the Project area. No artifacts or features were identified on the ground surface within the
proposed ROW during the pedestrian survey or identified during shovel testing. Ground surface
visibility was poor due to grass cover throughout the Project (Photo 1). Disturbances identified within
the Project included a built-up berm and associated borrow ditch associated with SH-36, along which
the survey paralleled, and multiple pipelines and existing electrical lines (Photos 2 through 5). Eightyone negative shovel tests, exceeding the minimum survey standards as described in the Archeological
Survey Standards for Texas (THC n.d.), were excavated to an average depth of 46.7 centimeters
below surface (cmbs) (Photo 6; Appendix A). Most of the shovel tests contained mixed clays with
gravels, pebbles, and/or small shell fragments. The shovel tests indicate that the area has been highly
disturbed by the construction of SH-36 and the multiple utilities that bisect and parallel the highway.
Table 1 summarizes the shovel test results.

RECOMMENDATIONS

POWER archeologists performed an intensive archeological survey of approximately 26.3 acres of
proposed new construction of an electric distribution line rebuild, the bulk of which is on TxDOT
property in Brazoria County. No cultural resources were recorded during the survey of the proposed
ROW and soils observed in shovel tests indicate the Project area has been disturbed by road
construction, borrow ditch excavation, and utilities that parallel and bisect the Project ROW. Due to
the lack of cultural materials and disturbance noted in the Project area, POWER recommends that
construction activities within the Project area be allowed to proceed without further consultation. If,
during construction of the distribution line cultural resources are encountered, all activities at the
location should be halted until the THC is notified and an appropriate course of action is determined.
POWER offers this report in partial fulfillment of Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8875 and in support
of USACE NWP 12 permitting.
