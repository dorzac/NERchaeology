ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of approximately 6.78 miles (total of 44.29 acres) of new
water transmission pipeline and 3.2 acres for the City of Abilene’s proposed In-Line
Booster Pump Station, located east and south of Breckenridge, Stephens County, Texas
was conducted by American Archaeology Group LLC in December 2014. The project was
conducted under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7094 and section 106
of the National and Historic Preservation Act (potential Corps of Engineers permitting).
The proposed depth of impacts are 10 feet below the ground surface, and the existing rightof-way is 50 feet. AAG focused its efforts on the existing right-of-way but also conducted
a pedestrian survey of an additional 30 feet of ground surface on the north side (from the
east end until the line turns south) then on the east side for the north-south segment, then
the south side for the remaining western section of the right-of-way in an effort to identify
any noticeable cultural resources that might be affected by light vehicular traffic during
access for the project, although construction and traffic are limited to the right-of-way.
Roughly 60% of the project area had been heavily disturbed by prior earth moving
activities. The survey included a systematic inspection of the ground surface of the project
area supported by backhoe trenching and shovel testing to test for subsurface deposits.
One historic trash scatter dating to the late-early 20th century (41SE330) was
recorded based on the presence of lavender glass, clear glass, brown glass, and white ware
ceramics in a bulldozed pile approximately 20 x 20 meters in size. It appears that this
historic scatter was bulldozed from the north (outside of the pipeline right-of-way) to the
south side of the existing pipeline, but contained within the south side of the right-of-way.
Shovel tests (ST-18 and ST-19) revealed no subsurface cultural deposits were present, no
features or any significant artifact assemblages, therefore, this site is not considered eligible
for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of designation
as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG)
recommends that construction within the project area be allowed to proceed as planned.
Monitoring during construction by a professional archaeologist is not considered
necessary. No artifacts were collected, therefore, no artifacts were curated, and project
records were curated at AAG.

INTRODUCTION
American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) is assisting the City of Abilene with the
permitting process required to proceed with construction of a new pipeline to transmit raw
water from Possum Kingdom Lake (PK) to the PK Raw Water Roughing Facility (RWRF).
Due to ongoing drought conditions an additional source of raw water for the City of Abilene
is needed. The planned project will consist of improvements to implement Possum Kingdom
Lake as a raw water supply under the City of Abilene’s Second Stage Short-term Drought
Strategy. This portion of the project is called the Brazos River Authority (BRA) Main Pipeline
and In-line Booster Pump Station due to pipeline location which is parallel to an existing BRA
pipeline. The designation is for location purposes and does not indicate ownership. In
December 2014, AAG conducted an archaeological survey and testing in the project area,
which covers approximately 6.78 mile pipeline right-of-way and a 3.2 acre pump station
(both total to be 44.29 acres) on the east side of Breckenridge, Texas (Figure 2). This report
describes the implementation and results of the investigation. Funding for the project was
provided by the City of Abilene.
The investigation was designed to detect prehistoric and/or historic cultural
resources that could potentially be impacted by the proposed pipeline and pump station.
Fieldwork was authorized by the Texas Historical Commission (Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 7094) and comprised systematic surface survey at 5 meter intervals and subsurface
testing was completed through backhoe trenching and shovel testing. The proposed depth
of impacts are 10 feet below the ground surface, and the existing right-of-way is 50 feet.
AAG focused its efforts on the existing right-of-way but also conducted a pedestrian survey
of an additional 30 feet of ground surface on the north side (from the east end until the line
turns south) then on the east side for the north-south segment, then the south side for the
remaining western section of the right-of-way in an effort to identify any noticeable cultural
resources that might be affected by light vehicular traffic during access for the project,
although construction and traffic are limited to the right-of-way. At the time fieldwork was
undertaken, approximately 60% of the project area had been subjected to various impacts
in the past including cutting and pipeline construction, right-of-way maintenance, erosion,
livestock grazing, bulldozing, livestock tank construction, and two-track vehicular impacts.
There were several major utility lines and other gas and water lines that traversed through
the project area. These impacts are extensive as noted by the presence of backfill rock in
the western portion of the project area.
The project area is depicted on the 7.5’ U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangles
Breckenridge, Buck Mountain, Necessity, Grand Lake, and Ivan South (Figure 2). The
U.T.M. coordinates for the approximate center of the tract are Zone 14 Northing 3623169
and Easting 517311. Appendix I contains the Research Design and Scope of Work. The
nearest water source is Cedar Creek and unnamed tributaries that cross through the project
area. The topographic range of the project area is 1,182 to 1,415 feet in elevation above
mean sea level (amsl).

Previous archaeological surveys in Stephens County have identified significant
prehistoric and historic sites. Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd Inc. contracted with American
Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) to perform an archaeological survey under the auspices
of the Texas Antiquities Code pursuant to Antiquities Permit Number 7094, and Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (potential Corps of Engineers permitting).

ENVIROMENTAL SETTING
Natural Setting
This section was previously prepared by AAG (Griggs et al. 2007:4). The project
area is located in the Cross Timbers and Prairies ecological region of Texas (Gould 1975).
This region covers 67,340 square kilometers (26,000 square miles) in the north central
portion of the state (Figure 3). Potential vegetation is alternating bands of wooded habitat
scattered throughout prairie dominated by one-three foot tall grasses (TPWD 2007a).
Historic anthropogenic disturbances have significantly altered native plant communities.
Common trees present today, particularly in the vicinity of Stephens County, include
pecan, mesquite, hackberry and elm. Grasses include broom weed, wild rye and milkweed.
The topography is broken with hilly plateaus. Average annual rainfall levels in the Cross
Timbers region grade higher from east to west. In Stephens County the average annual
rainfall is 67.1 centimeters (26.4 inches). Average temperatures range from a low of 31°
F in January to a high of 98° F in July (Leffler 2007).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Cultural Sequence
This section was previously prepared by AAG (Griggs et al. 2007:8-11). The land
that is now Texas has been occupied by human populations for more than 11,000 years. A
chronological framework developed by archaeologists for the interpretation of Texas
history comprises five general temporal periods whose boundaries correspond to
significant cultural and social developments (Nunley 1989:37-46). These periods and their
approximate dates are as follows: 1) Paleoindian (11,500- 8500 before present [hereafter
B.P.]); 2) Archaic (8500-1200 B.P.); 3) Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800-1450); 4) Protohistoric
(A.D. 1450-1650); and 5) Historic (A.D. 1650-1940s).
The Paleoindian period begins during the last Glacial and continues into the early
Holocene. The earliest confirmed Paleoindian populations in Texas were small, highly
mobile bands of hunters armed with distinctive fluted “Clovis” projectile points who
pursued large, late Pleistocene mammals, most notably mammoths (Surovell 2000; Turner
and Hester 1985; Waguespack and Surovell 2003). Later Paleoindian populations
developed new forms of projectile points and refined their hunting strategies in response
to environmental factors such as the extinction of the mammoth and other megamammals;
yet despite these adaptations, they maintained life ways more like those of their
predecessors than those of later Archaic populations.
The complete demise of the Pleistocene big-game animals and climate change
accompanying the onset of the Holocene are linked to shifts in stone tool technology,
subsistence pursuits and settlement patterns that define the Archaic period. The
Paleoindian-Archaic transition, like those between succeeding periods, occurred gradually.
As the Pleistocene megamammals began to vanish, indigenous populations focused on
smaller game and increased their reliance on local plant foods. With changes in subsistence
came new and more diverse stone toolkits and an increase in tools made of wood and other
organic materials. Additionally, settlements became more stable, and there is evidence for
progressively sophisticated cultural practices, such as systematic burial of the dead
(Bousman et al. 2002). Although the Archaic hunting and gathering lifeway remained
relatively stable for thousands of years, archaeologists are able to define four sub periods
(or eras) – Early, Middle, Late and Transitional – based on a dated sequence of diagnostic
projectile points (Turner and Hester 1985:47-49).
The Late Prehistoric period is marked in some areas of Texas, including the north
central region, by the introduction of domesticated plant foods such as corn and beans.
Technological innovations such as pottery and the bow and arrow were widely adopted
(Nunley 1989:44; Turner and Hester 1985:82).
The Protohistoric period is associated with an incipient European presence in the
region. Protohistoric indigenous populations were the first described in early ethnohistoric
accounts. Often, these accounts reflected only indirect contact. Items of European

8

manufacture are occasionally found in Protohistoric sites, though in most cases these items
were not acquired directly but through so called down-the-line trading (Nunley 1989:45).
The Historic period is characterized by a firm historical record and increasing direct
contact between indigenous and European explorers and settlers. Horses introduced by the
Spanish and European material culture led to profound changes in indigenous cultures.
Eventually, Old World diseases, resettlement and warfare claimed up to 95% of Texas
Indians (Klos 2007). The latter part of the Historic period encompasses the AngloEuropean settlement of Texas.
Local Archaeological and Historical Context
In Stephens County 320 archaeological sites are registered with Texas Historical
Commission. The vast majority of these are located in the north central and northeastern
part of the county along the Clear Fork of the Brazos River and on Hubbard Creek
downstream from the Hubbard Creek Reservoir (RCRI 2014). The distribution of these
sites reflects both a predilection on the part of prehistoric populations for riparian
settlements, which provided access to fresh water and game animals, and a recent surge in
archaeological surveys along river ways targeted for reservoir projects.
Sites dating to all periods of the cultural chronology outlined in the section above,
with the exception of the Protohistoric, are represented in site records for Stephens County
(RCRI 2014). It is possible that some of the registered Late Prehistoric sites were occupied
in the Protohistoric period, but this is difficult to demonstrate since most material remains
from the Protohistoric are indistinguishable from those of the Late Prehistoric. Paleoindian
sites are truly rare in the county; only one has been registered (site 41SE78). Most
prehistoric sites have been assigned to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods on the basis
of temporally diagnostic artifacts, primarily arrow points. Two sites from these periods
(41SE2 and 41SE3) contain rock art, which is uncommon in north central Texas (Figure 4;
Jackson 1938: 292-295). Around 15% of sites in the county contain historic components
that range from simple surface scatters of historic debris, such as glass and metal, to oilfield
camps and buildings. The County Courthouse, located in Breckenridge, has been
designated as a State Archaeological Landmark (RCRI 2014).

1938:plates CCXIV, CCXV).
The best documented period of prehistory in north central Texas is the Late
Prehistoric. During this period a large block of north central Texas, including much of
Stephens County, was occupied by interrelated populations whose shared cultural traits,
(e.g., artifact types and adaptive strategies) are referred to by archaeologists as the
Henrietta Focus. The Harrell site, located only a few miles north of Stephens County at
the confluence of the Brazos River and Clear Fork, is the “type site,” or ideal example, of
the Henrietta Focus (Krieger 1946:137). Current estimates place the chronological range
of the focus between A.D. 1200-1600 (Lynott 2007). Inhabitants of the Harrell site and
other Henrietta Focus sites were maize agriculturalists and hunters. Bison was the
preferred game, but deer, antelope and other small mammals, as well as turtles, turkey,
ducks and fish also contributed to the subsistence base. The material culture of the
Henrietta Focus is uniquely represented by a shell tempered pottery, Nocona Plain. Other
artifacts associated with the focus, though not exclusive to it, are small, triangular Harrell
and Washita arrow points (Figure 5), diamond-shaped and leaf-shaped bifaces, manos,
metates, bison scapula hoes, deer ulna flakers and disc beads made of perforated mussel or
Olivella shell (Krieger 1946:137-141; Lynott 2007). These artifacts, as well as a farming
and hunting subsistence base, link the Henrietta Focus to a broader cultural tradition, the
Plains Villager Horizon, which extends across the river valleys of the Southern Plains.
Trade relations with groups to the west are indicated at Henrietta Focus sites by the

10

occurrence of stone tools made of agatized dolomite from the Alibates Flint Quarry in the
Texas Panhandle and Puebloan pottery from the New Mexico area (Krieger 1946:111-112,
119).

Krieger 1946:fig. 7, e-h).
During the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, north central Texas witnessed
the arrival of the Comanche, Kiowa and Tonkawa Indians. These groups are believed to
have migrated from the Great Basin and High Plains regions after acquiring Spanish horses.
All three were nomadic and depended on the buffalo for their subsistence (Mayhall 2007;
Lipscomb 2007; Carlisle 2007).
In the late 1850s, Anglo settlers began moving into north central Texas, and in 1858
the Texas legislature established what is now known as Stephens County (the original name
of Buchanan County was changed to Stephens in 1861 in honor of the vice president of the
Confederate States of America). Though early settlers were constantly harassed by raiding
parties of Comanche and Kiowa Indians until the early 1870s, the population of the county
grew steadily, reaching 4,725 by 1880 (Leffler 2007).
The first waves of Anglo settlers in Stephens County were primarily cattle ranchers.
By the late nineteenth century, however, cotton and corn farming provided a significant
contribution to the local economy. Cotton production fell precipitously following a boll
weevil infestation in the first decade of the twentieth century, but that bad fortune was
eventually eclipsed by an oil boom that began in 1916 with a strike at a well near Caddo.
Additional fields were soon discovered, and by 1922 Stephens County accounted for 15
percent of all the oil produced in the United States. The boom lured thousands of new
residents to the county, as well as eighty-nine oil companies and two railroads. Although
production slowed by the mid-1920s, oil remains a significant industry in the county. Other
key industries in Stephens County today are recreation, livestock agriculture and
manufacturing. Manufactured products include mobile homes, furniture, aircraft parts,
petrochemical and oilfield equipment (Leffler 2007; Hunt 2007).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Shelton (2009) conducted an archaeological survey for the Stephens Regional
Special Utility District (RSUD) Waterline Improvements immediately west of the current
project area next to Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek. One prehistoric lithic procurement site
was recorded (41SE307). The site was determined to be ineligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places.
Griggs et al. (2007) surveyed approximately 2.98 acres for proposed improvements
at the Anniversary Park, located on the west side of Lake Hubbard Creek in Stephens
County, Texas in March 2007. The planned project consisted of improvements at a boat
ramp location within Anniversary Park, south of Highway 180. No archaeological sites
were encountered.

12

PROJECT METHODOLOGY
The project was divided into three phases – archival research, field survey, and
report preparation. The archival research consisted of a check for records of registered
sites in the online “Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,” which is maintained by the Texas
Historical Commission, as well as a review of other literature for publications concerning
previous work in the county.
The field investigation was conducted in December 2014. The field investigation
involved a pedestrian surface survey supported with backhoe trenching and shovel testing
(Figure 2; Appendix I-II). The survey was conducted systematically across the entire 6.78
mile pipeline right-of-way and 3.2 acre project area, with members of the survey team
inspecting the ground surface along linear transects spaced at 5 meter intervals. The
proposed depth of impacts are 10 feet below the ground surface, and the existing right-ofway is 50 feet. AAG focused its efforts on the existing right-of-way but also conducted a
pedestrian survey of an additional 30 feet of ground surface on the north side (from the east
end until the line turns south) then on the east side for the north-south segment, then the
south side for the remaining western section of the right-of-way in an effort to identify any
noticeable cultural resources that might be affected by light vehicular traffic during access
for the project, although construction and traffic are limited to the right-of-way.
Approximately 60% of the ground surface of the project area had been disturbed
by prior earth moving activities. Other surface disturbances included cutting and pipeline
construction, right-of-way maintenance, erosion, livestock grazing, bulldozing, livestock
tank construction, and two-track vehicular impacts. There were several major utility lines
and other gas and water lines that traversed through the project area. Visibility of the
ground surface was obscured by patches of short grasses. There were 21 backhoe trenches
(BHTs) excavated to test for subsurface deposits of cultural remains and they ranged from
the shallowest at 15 centimeters to the deepest at 135 centimeters in depth with the average
test depth of 73.57 centimeters. Additionally, 19 shovel tests were placed along the project
alignment to provide additional near surface testing. They ranged from the shallowest at 5
centimeters to the deepest at 85 centimeters and the average depth was 23.26 centimeters.
Samples of soil from each BHT were screened through ¼” hardware cloth. Typical soil
profiles encountered along the pipeline corridor include BHT-10 (Figure 6) and BHT-19
(Figure 7).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
A review of the archaeological literature for Stephens County revealed no
previously recorded sites within the project area. There were three sites worth referencing
which include 41SE5, 41SE301 and 41SE32. The first is an exposed bedrock mortar
(prehistoric) with five “eye-shaped” mortar holes. This site is located on a peninsula
extending into Hubbard Creek Reservoir northwest of the project area. Site 41SE301 lies
to the west of the project area, just north of Hwy 180. It is the ruin of an historic homestead.
Several sherds of glass and historic earthenware were recovered during a surface collection
at the site, and a cistern was documented. Site 41SE32, located west of 41SE301, is
described as a prehistoric campsite with a Late Prehistoric component. Several chipped
stone tools and a Scallorn arrow point were recovered during a surface survey. No
additional field research was recommended at any of the three sites by the archaeologists
who documented them.
Field Survey
The field investigation conducted for this project covered 6.78 miles of pipeline
right-of-way and 3.2 acres for the in-line booster pump station east of Breckenridge,
Stephens County. Roughly 60% of the project area had been heavily disturbed by prior
earth moving activities. The survey included a systematic inspection of the ground surface
of the project area supported by backhoe trenching and shovel testing to test for subsurface
deposits.
One historic trash scatter dating to the late-early 20th century (41SE330) was
recorded based on the presence of lavender glass, clear glass, brown glass, and white ware
ceramics in a bulldozed pile approximately 20 x 20 meters in size. It appears that this
historic scatter was bulldozed from the north (outside of the pipeline right-of-way) to the
south side of the existing pipeline, but contained within the south side of the right-of-way.
Shovel tests (ST-18 and ST-19) revealed no subsurface cultural deposits were present, no
features or any significant artifact assemblages, therefore, this site is not considered eligible
for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of designation
as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).

RECOMMENDATIONS
American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction within the
project area be allowed to proceed as planned. No artifacts were collected, therefore, no
curation was necessary. Monitoring during construction by a professional archaeologist is
not considered necessary. However, should any cultural materials be exposed in any area
not discussed in this report, all work in the immediate area must cease until the situation
can be evaluated by American Archaeology Group LLC in consultation with the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd, Inc.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN AND SCOPE OF WORK
Records Check
Prior to entering the field, American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) will contact
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, the state
repository for site records on Texas, to determine if previously recorded sites are present
in the project area. This task may be conducted by a personal visit to TARL or by telephone.
The library at A.A.G. is very extensive, especially regarding reports for the project
area region, and much of the archival work can be accomplished in-house. Since A.A.G.
has conducted work in the area, much of the background work has already been
accomplished.
Permit Application
No fieldwork will commence until a permit from the Archeology Division (AD) of
the Texas Historical Commission has been issued. An application for an antiquities permit
will be submitted to AD-THC as soon as A.A.G. receives Notice To Proceed. Normally,
A.A.G. discusses the project with AD personnel before beginning any fieldwork. This is
done to ensure that both parties are in agreement as to the level of work required for this
project.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed utilizing the pedestrian
survey method supported by shovel testing and/or augering and examination of eroded and
disturbed areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Herbert G. Uecker
will act as the Principal Investigator. Shovel testing, augering, and backhoe trenching will
meet and exceed the Minimum Survey Standards For Texas established by the THC.
In areas of poor visibility, and environmental settings that have potential for buried
cultural materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of
high site probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill from shovel
tests will be screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually
excavated to sterile clay or bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, camera,
compass, and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches,
and archaeological sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried sites,
select areas in alluvial settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be subjected
to backhoe trenching. All sites identified in the project area will be mapped in the field and
plotted on a topographic map. Site locations will also be determined through the use of a
Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site will be recorded using the official State of

21

Texas Archeological Site Form. In no case will the survey crew work outside of the project
area as depicted on the project area map provided by the client.
Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered
through shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on
a field sack log. They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless
a petition to discard is prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has been
approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be delivered to
AD-THC and the client. A.A.G. will maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms,
and any other records produced from the project deemed to be a work product.
Scope of Work
I.

Conduct background check for previously recorded archaeological sites in the
project area and the vicinity. Review the relevant literature.

II.

Discuss the project with the AD-THC reviewer assigned to this project before
entering the field.

III.

Obtain an antiquities permit from AD-THC.

IV.

Consult with the representative of the sponsor before beginning the field survey.

V.

Perform a 100% pedestrian survey of the project area to include shovel testing, and
examination of all exposed areas such as creek banks for buried or displaced
artifacts.

VI.

Check for deeply buried sites through the use of backhoe trenching in areas with
deep soils.

VII.

Analyze all artifacts recovered and prepare them for curation at TARL.

VIII.

Prepare a draft report and submit copies to the AD-THC and the sponsor for review.

IX.

Make all required changes, correct any mistakes, and submit the final report and
turn in the artifacts for curation.
