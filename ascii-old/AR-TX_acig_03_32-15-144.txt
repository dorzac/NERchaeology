Abstract
On December 17, 2015, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural resources
survey for CDM Smith of the proposed Daniel’s Mountain EST Expansion project for the
City of Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas. The project will involve the construction
of an elevated storage tank for the purposes of containing public drinking water. The
tank will be constructed on a one-acre parcel immediately adjacent to a similar currently
contains two existing elevated storage tanks (Figures 1 and 2). The Area Potential Effect
(APE) for this project is defined as the one-acre parcel on which the third elevated
storage tank will be located.
The survey did not result in the locat ion of any new archeological sites, historic
structures, or any addit ional historic propert ies. Based on these results, no further
archeological work is recommended. Records from this invest igat ion will be curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Julie Shipp served as Principal Invest igator.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
On December 17, 2015, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural
resources survey of the proposed Daniel’s Mountain EST Expansion project for the City
of Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas. The project will involve the construction of
an elevated storage tank for the purposes of containing public drinking water. The tank
will be constructed on a one-acre parcel immediately adjacent to a similar one-acre
parcel that currently contains two existing elevated storage tanks (Figures 1 and 2). The
Area of Potential Effect (APE) for this project is defined as the one-acre parcel on which
the third elevated storage tank will be located (Figures 1 and 2).
The invest igat ion performed by aci consisted of a background review covering the APE
and an intensive archaeological survey of the one-acre parcel containing the proposed
Daniel’s Mountain EST Expansion project. The project is located on public land and is
therefore subject to the Texas Ant iquit ies Code. The background review included an
evaluat ion of the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas to determine if any previously
recorded archaeological sites, historic cemeteries, Nat ional Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) propert ies, State Ant iquit ies Landmarks (SAL), or Registered Texas Historic
Landmarks (RTHL) are located within the APE. Addit ionally, a review of relevant soils
data was performed to aid in planning the archaeological survey. The archaeological
survey included a pedestrian survey and shovel test ing where appropriate in
accordance with THC and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards.
No archaeological sites were recorded during the survey and no previously recorded
archaeological sites, cemeteries, NRHP properties, SALs, or RTHLs were identified
during the background review. As such, the following report is presented in the short
report format defined by the CTA for small projects with negative results.

2.0 BACKGROUNDREVIEW
A review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas 2015) revealed that no
archeological sites have been previously recorded within the APE, and that no portions
of the APE have been previously surveyed. Furthermore, no sites have been recorded
within 0.6 mile (one kilometer) of the APE (Figure 4). The three archaeological sites in
closest proximity to the APE (41WM436, 41WM1139, and 41WM1135), are surficial
campsites that were recommended as not eligible for the NRHP The sites are located to
the north, northwest, and southeast of the APE and are well outside the project area.
Additionally, no NRHP properties, SALs, RTHLs, or cemeteries are located within the
APE, or within one kilometer of the APE
The soils within in the APE are mapped as Georgetown stony clay loam and Brackett
gravelly clay loam (NRCS 2015) (Figure 3). Both soils are shallow, upland soils that
formed in situ over Cretaceous-age limestone. Deeply buried archeological sites are not
anticipated and thus pedestrian survey and shovel testing are adequate methods for
identifying archaeological sites in the APE and backhoe trenching was not proposed for
this investigation.

3.0 FIELD METHODS
A pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate any archeological sites or other
historical properties that may be adversely affected by construction. The pedestrian
survey was conducted within the entire APE (see Figures 1 and 2) and included
transects at 15-meter intervals and shovel testing where appropriate.
Shovel tests were excavated in settings where the ground surface visibility was less
than 30 percent. The tests measured approximately 30 centimeters in diameter and
were excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits. The shovel tests were dug in 10
centimeter levels, and the excavated soil was clay and was sorted by hand. Shovel tests
were recorded on logs and the locations of the tests were mapped with a GPS unit.
Photographs were taken and a field journal was maintained.
4.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
The survey was conducted under pleasant conditions in the morning, under a partly
cloudy sky, with a light breeze. The topography is gently sloped downward to the
north, away from where the two existing elevated water storage tanks are located
(Figure 6). The vegetation within the APE consisted primarily of ashe juniper and oak
trees, with some prickly pear and mixed grasses. Ground surface visibility was generally
good and ranged from 50 - 70 percent (Figure 7). Naturally occurring chert gravels and
cobbles were observed scattered across the surface of the APE, however, none of the
materials appeared to be worked and no cultural materials were found during the
survey.
Three shovel tests were dug within the APE. Soils consisted primarily of shallow and
eroded upland clay soil. The shovel tests locations were determined by the Principal
Investigator based upon a field analysis of the topography, vegetation, and the
likelihood of encountering cultural materials. No cultural materials were observed on
the surface or with in the excavated shovel tests

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural resources survey of the
proposed Daniel’s Mountain EST Expansion project for the City of Georgetown,
Williamson County, Texas on December 17, 2015. The project will involve the
construction of an elevated storage tank for the purposes of containing public drinking
water. The tank will be constructed on a one-acre parcel immediately adjacent to a

The invest igat ion consisted of a pedestrian survey augmented by three shovel tests,
and did not result in the locat ion of any new archeological sites or other historic
propert ies. Based on these results, no further archeological work is recommended. If
any cultural resources are observed during the course of construct ion for this project,
the City of Georgetown and/or CDM Smith are advised to contact the Texas Historical
Commission.
