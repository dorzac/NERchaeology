ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists completed a 100-percent intensive areal pedestrian survey for the
proposed Austin Community College (ACC) Elgin tract project located in eastern Travis County and
western Bastrop County, Texas, northeast of the intersection of US 290 and County Line Road. The
survey was conducted for Amec-Geomatrix on behalf of ACC, the City of Austin, and Travis County for
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) compliance. Investigations were coordinated with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) under ACT Permit #5747. The proposed new campus location covers approximately
98 acres in area, of which archeologists surveyed 100 percent on foot. The survey consisted of pedestrian
inspection supplemented by shovel testing (n=51) and mechanical trench excavations (n=6) within the
proposed projectâs footprint. The survey area was found to be largely undeveloped, open rangeland with
deep, dense clays that were moderately inundated in some areas at the time of survey as a result of recent
rains. During survey, one historic-age farmstead site was encountered and recorded as Site 41BP855.
While largely intact, neither the main structure nor associated outbuildings are recommended eligible for
listing as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). Hicks & Company recommends that the proposed
undertaking should be allowed to proceed with no further cultural resource coordination. This survey
followed a no-collection policy, and all artifacts were returned to their find location in the field. All
project-generated notes, forms, photographs and artifacts will be permanently curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

Management Summary

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Hicks & Company archeologists, working on behalf of the City of Austin, Austin Community College
(ACC), and AMEC-Geomatrix, conducted a 100-percent intensive areal archeological survey of
approximately 98 acres of a proposed ACC campus in eastern Travis County and western Bastrop
County, Texas, northeast of the intersection of US 290 and County Line Road (Figure 1). While exact
design plans are still in progress, it is assumed that planned construction of the new educational campus
includes various facilities including buildings, parking lots, and both above and below-ground utilities
and infrastructure.
Investigations were conducted under ACT Permit #5747 in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) guidelines for intensive areal surveys.
Investigations involved pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel testing and backhoe trench
excavations to identify and evaluate the horizontal and vertical extent of archeological deposits within the
proposed project area. Archeologists surveyed 100 percent of the proposed ACC Elgin tract on foot. A
total of 51 shovel tests and six backhoe trenches were excavated within the project area. The backhoe
trenches were placed at opportunistic locations on terraces located west of Elm Creek (Appendix A).
The survey area was largely a mix of open pasture land with moderately deep, dense clays within the
floodplain, shallow clay loams along the uplands, and dense loams within agricultural fields. The
archeological survey conformed to the THCâs minimum standards for intensive areal archeological
investigations, using a combination of backhoe trenching, shovel testing, and surface inspection. During
survey, one historic-age farmstead site was encountered and recorded as Site 41BP855. While largely
intact, neither this structure nor its associated outbuildings are considered eligible for listing as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL).
Since the project will take place on land owned by ACC, a division of the City of Austin, it is subject to
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The project lacks federal permitting or funding, though, and is
therefore not subject to coordination under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended.
This project was previously coordinated with the THC, and an intensive archeological survey was
recommended in their coordination response letter on August 17, 2010 (letter, Wolfe to Cole
[Appendix B]). Hicks & Company recommends that the proposed undertaking should be allowed to
proceed with no further cultural resource coordination. The THC concurred with Hicks & Companyâs
recommendations in a letter dated October 17, 2011 (letter, Wolfe to Champion [Appendix B]). All
project-generated notes, forms, photographs, and artifacts will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
Fieldwork for the archeological survey occurred during September of 2010, requiring approximately 50
man-hours to complete. Report production immediately followed conclusion of fieldwork. John Fulmer
served as Principal Investigator for the project, Joshua Haefner as Project Archeologist, Samantha
Champion as Crew Chief, and Emily Reed contributed as Architectural Historian. John Fulmer, Joshua
Haefner and Samantha Champion conducted the survey. Jerod McCleland, assisted by David Fowler, is
credited for the Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping. Josh Haefner, Samantha Champion,
Emily Reed, and Gregg Cestaro authored the report. Subsequent sections of this report include
Environmental and Cultural Backgrounds with a brief discussion of previous surveys and recorded sites, a
description of field methodology, and a discussion of the results of field investigations. This is followed
by a detailed description of the formal regulatory recommendations. This report is offered in partial
fulfillment of ACT Permit #5747.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Geology and Soils
According to the Geological Atlas of Texas (GAT), the property is predominantly underlain by the
geologic formation referred to as the Midway Group (BEG 1974). The Midway Group (Emi) includes the
Wills Point Formation and the Kincaid Formation. The Wills Point Formation contains clay, silt, and
sand with sand more abundant in upward portions. It is slightly glauconitic near the base and is massive
and poorly bedded. The upper part (Pisgah Member) and lower part (Littig Member) of the Kincaid
Formation contain sand and clay. The Midway group dates to the Eocene and long predates the presence
of humans in the Americas. Archeological sites in these contexts are generally found on or near the
current ground surface. Terraces along Elm Creek are mapped as Late Pleistocene Quaternary (Qt) units.
They contain gravel, sand, silt, and clay in various proportions with gravel more prominent in the older,
higher terraces. This geological formation coincides with the arrival of the first humans into the
Americas. Hence, deeply buried artifact deposits are more likely to be located within or close to the Elm
Creek flood plain than in other regions of the project area. Local topography is generally gently sloping
toward Elm Creek.
Soils mapped within the project area in order of total surface area are: Wilson clay loam, 1 to 3 percent
slopes (44%) and 0 to 1 percent slopes (27%); Crocket fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes, eroded
(14%); Tinn clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, occasionally flooded (8.4%); and Whitesboro clay loam, 0 to 1
percent slopes, frequently flooded (6.6%). The Wilson series is described as quaternary alluvium derived
from mixed sources deposited onto stream terraces. The upper bed of the Wilson Series is generally
comprised of loamy clays that reach depths of approximately six inches before giving way to clays of
increasing thickness that can extend to depths approaching 85 inches below the surface. The Crockett
series, residuum weathered from tertiary-age shale, is generally located on ridges and upland slopes with
depths that can reach up to 60 inches. Located in floodplain settings, Tinn clays typically reach depths of
80 inches before contacting the water table. With average depths nearing 80 inches, Whitesboro clay
loams are Holocene-aged alluvial deposits that typically occupy flood plains. Along with the Wilson
series, Whitesboro clay loam within the project area exhibits the best potential to contain intact buried
archeological deposits; however, it should be mentioned that Site 41BP541 was located along an eroding
bank adjacent to Elm Creek in an area mapped as Tinn clay. Hence, it is assumed a significant portion of
the proposed project area overlays soils that may house subsurface prehistoric features or artifacts.

Flora and Fauna
The project area occurs in the vicinity of the Blackland Prairies ecological region of Texas. The
Blackland Prairies region encompasses approximately 11.5 million acres of nearly level to rolling prairies
and grasslands interspersed with dense woodlands. The region forms a broad wedge between the
Edwards Plateau and Cross Timbers and Prairies to the west and the Post Oak Savannah to the east, with
which it intermingles.
The project area includes small wooded areas, mixed grassland, and farmland. Vegetation other than
cropland that would be expected in the area according to mapping conducted by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department (McMahan et al. 1984) would include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium),
sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), three-awn (Aristida spp.),
hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides),
windmillgrass (Chloris spp.), tumblegrass (Schedonnardus paniculatus), western ragweed (Ambrosia
psilostachya), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), Texas bluebonnet (Lupinus texensis), live oak
(Quercus virginiana), post oak (Quercus stellata), and mesquite.

Management Summary

Common species occurring within the river and creek drainages include pecan, cedar elm (Ulmus
crassifolia), American elm (Ulmus americana), hackberry, cottonwood, sycamore (Platanus occidentalis)
and black willow (Salix nigra). Invasion by mesquite, false willow (Baccharis spp.) and non-native
ligustrum (Ligustrum spp.) is also evident. Characteristic understory shrubs and vines include saw
greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox), yaupon, (Ilex vomitoria), bumelia (Bumelia lanuginosa), grape (Vitis spp.)
and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans).
A high diversity of fish and wildlife is known to exist in Central Texas and Travis County. According to
county records maintained by Texas A&M University (2009), amphibians and reptiles are represented by
five species of salamanders, 21 species of frogs and toads, eight species of turtles, eleven different kinds
of skinks and lizards, 27 different snakes and the American alligator. Texas Tech University (2008) has
documented at least 60 species of mammals in this region, while 471 bird species have been documented
within the oaks and prairies region that includes eastern Travis County (TPWD 2003).
Commonly occurring mammal species that would be expected in the project area include but are not
limited to: coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), Virginia
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus),
eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Common reptile species include
the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), Mediterranean gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus), collared lizard
(Crotaphytus collaris), checkered garter snake (Thamnophis marcianus), and water snake (Nerodia
erythrogaster). Frequent bird species would include northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), northern
cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), house sparrow (Passer domesticus),
house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica), mourning dove (Zenaida
macroura), American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), redshouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), Cooperâs hawk (Accipiter cooperii), great horned owl (Bubo
virginianus), gray phase of the eastern screech owl (Otus asio), barred owl (Strix varia), common grackle
(Quiscalus quiscula), great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), and
black vulture (Coragyps atratus).
The climate of Travis County is considered humid subtropical, characterized by hot summers and cool
winters with an average high temperature in July of 96 degrees Fahrenheit and an average low
temperature in January of 38 degrees. Annual average precipitation is 81 centimeters (32 inches), with
peak precipitation in May and September. Summers are generally dry with occasional thunderstorms.

Hydrology
The property is located in the Colorado River basin. Measured in length and drainage area, the Colorado
River is the largest river wholly in Texas. Its drainage area is 39,900 square miles, and its runoff reaches
a volume of more than 2 million acre-feet near the Gulf (TSHA 2010). Stormwater runoff from this
property flows into Elm Creek, which flows into the Colorado River via Wilbarger Creek by way of Dry
Creek.

Land Use
The property encompasses approximately 98 acres about three miles west of Elgin in the northeast
quadrant of the intersection of County Line Road and US 290 in Bastrop and Travis Counties, Texas. It
lies immediately south of the County Line Subdivision. Traveling east and south from the northeast
corner of the proposed project area, the broad, flat upland landform is overgrown grazing land for cattle
(Figure 2). A north-south fenceline divides this wide field from the historic structure that comprises Site
41BP855 (Figure 3). East of 41BP855, the topography descends into a wide floodplain terrace formation

that is currently utilized as a grazing area for cattle (Figure 4). Together, these areas account for
approximately two-thirds of the northern extent of the project area. Adjacent to and south of the upland
pasture lies a corn field bounded by US 290 to the south and County Line Road to the west (Figure 5).
Across a north-trending two-track from the agricultural field lays a currently unutilized tract of land. Elm
Creek lies within the extreme southeast corner of the project area, flowing through the property for
approximately 140 feet with an ordinary high water mark of approximately ten feet (Figures 6 and 7).

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Archeological Background
The project area is located within the Central Texas Archeological Region (Figure 8). Most of the recent
chronologies for Central Texas are based on six distinct time periods, roughly representing a 12000 year
sequence of occupation. A synthesis of the culture-historical sequences provided by Collins (2004) and
Johnson (1995) is as follows: Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP), Early Archaic (8800-5800 BP), Middle
Archaic (5800-4000 BP), Late Archaic (4000-1400 BP), Post-Archaic or Late Prehistoric (AD 600-1600),
and Historic (AD 1600 to present). Although these divisions represent convenient temporal categories,
they are also based in large part on perceived adaptations in subsistence and are reflected in changes in
lithic and other technologies.
Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP)
The early Paleoindian culture in South and Central Texas is believed to be related to the well-known big
game hunting tradition of the Great Plains (Hester 1980). Most of the well-documented early Paleoindian
sites in Texas that are associated with extinct megafauna are located north and west of Central Texas on
the Llano Estacado and adjacent areas of the Southern High Plains. In general, early Paleoindian sites are
scarce in Central Texas, or at least less visible than later sites. Conversely, later Paleoindian sites are
much more numerous in South and Central Texas, although both are usually identified from only surfacecollected artifacts (Black and McGraw 1985). Subsistence data from several late Paleoindian sites does
suggest, however, that small game was exploited rather than extinct megafauna. This data supports the
idea that a hunting and gathering lifestyle may have already been adopted across much of Southwest and
Central Texas prior to the Early Archaic period.
Paleoindian occupations in Central Texas have typically been associated with lanceolate projectile points
such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, and Meserve and stemmed points such as Scottsbluff
(Turner and Hester 1993). Recent investigations at the Wilson Leonard Site (41WM235) (Collins 2004)
equate three styles of projectiles, Golondrina/Barber, St. Maryâs Hall and Wilson, to the late Paleoindian
period. The Wilson component is dated at 10000 to 9650 BP and is associated with features, artifacts,
and a burial that are more Archaic-like in nature than Paleoindian (Collins 2004). The data from this site
further suggests that the Archaic nature of the adaptation continues during the ensuing Golondrina/Barber
and St. Maryâs Hall components. These are dated between 9500 and 8800 BP and may represent a
transitional period between the Paleoindian and the Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8800 - 5800 BP)
The Early Archaic period is subdivided into three projectile point style intervals: Angostura, Early Split
Stem and Martindale/Uvalde, from 8800 to 6000 BP (Collins 2004). Generally, the shift from
Paleoindian to Archaic subsistence strategies is measured by a change in technology focused on the use of
burned rocks to process geophyte plant foods. This shift is traced back as early as 8800 BP at the WilsonLeonard Site and at roughly comparable ages at several other Central Texas sites (Decker et al. 1999;
Thoms et al. 1996). At these sites, evidence for the use of earth ovens and burned rock technologies for
processing plant foods is associated with lanceolate Angostura projectile points. Hence, the use of
Angostura and late Paleoindian lithic technologies may have continued on into the Early Archaic period
for a time but was gradually replaced by the bifurcate base split-stem and Martindale/Uvalde styles.

Management Summary

The Early Archaic period marks a shift to the use of multiple tons of burned limestone and other rocks in
the form of scatters, hearths, middens and other features for the heated processing of plant foods. This
represents the start of a long-lived Archaic cooking tradition, lasting from roughly 8800 to 1400 BP. This
tradition was characterized by the repeated utilization of earth ovens and the resulting creation of burned
rock middens at strategic places on the landscape. These new subsistence practices began with a
distinctive cooking technology using layered arrangements of heated rocks in earth ovens, allowing for
exploitation of a broad range of geophytes. These included upland xerophytic plants like sotol and other
species such as Lily family onion bulbs, which grow in wetter environments (Decker et al. 1999).
Some of the most recent climatic reconstructions for the period posit a moist and cool late Pleistocene
environment with early to mid-Holocene shifts to drier conditions that became most pronounced during
the mid-Holocene (ca. 5000-7000 BP, Ricklis and Collins 1994). In contrast, Johnson (1995) suggests
that the relatively mesic conditions of the eastern Edwards Plateau during the Pleistocene and early
Holocene/Paleoindian period underwent a brief dry interval during Late Paleoindian times, later returning
to more mesic conditions during the ensuing Early Archaic period (roughly 8000-5800 BP). Whether the
Early Archaic climate reflects a gradual drying period (Ricklis and Collins 1994) or a more mesic interval
within an overall, long-lived trend toward aridity along the eastern Edwards Plateau, it appears that the
use of burned rock midden technologies for plant food and other types of subsistence related processing
began during this period and continued for many thousands of years.
Overall, the bulk of the Central Texas archeological literature suggests that the Early Archaic occupations
were generally small, widely distributed, and non-specialized (Black and McGraw 1985). Explanations
for these characteristics support a generalized hunting-gathering strategy involving relatively high group
mobility, poorly defined territories, and short-term occupations. Broad spectrum, well-adapted, highly
mobile subsistence strategies are theorized.
Middle Archaic (ca. 5800 - 4000 BP)
The Middle Archaic marks an intensification of the use of burned rock technologies to process plants and
other types of foods within an increasingly arid environment. Ricklis and Collins (1994) recognize a
pronounced mid-Holocene drying event from 7000 to 5000 BP, though it may have lasted longer.
Johnson (1995) posits the occurrence of a dry Edwards Interval along the eastern Edwards Plateau from
roughly 5500 to 1400 BP. Evidence for this is seen in the cessation of significant overbank sediment
aggradation at a number of Central Texas sites. Instead of deposition, arid conditions catalyzed extensive
downcutting and erosion along many Central Texas streams. Hypothetically, dry conditions would have
promoted the spread of desert succulent xerophytic plants and fostered the increased use of burned rock
middens. Drier conditions may also have engendered the return of bison to the plateau during the Middle
and Late Archaic periods. Furthermore, the proliferation of Bell/Andice/Calf Creek projectile point styles
at the beginning of the Middle Archaic may have coincided with the return of bison to the Edwards
Plateau and the adjacent Blackland Prairie; these broad bladed points have been associated with the
exploitation of bison within archeological literature. Additional Middle Archaic projectile point styles
include Early Triangular, La Jita, Nolan and Travis.
Late Archaic (ca 4000 - 1400 BP)
Recent refinements in the Central Texas chronology divide the Late Archaic interval into two different
subperiods (Johnson 1995). Subperiod I is marked by the appearance of Bulverde projectile points, which
along with later forms (Pedernales, Castroville, Marshall and Montell) were used to hunt bison and other
large game. Burned rock middens continued to proliferate during the Late Archaic I interval. The
resources processed via burned rock technology may have included yucca, sotol, and perhaps agave
lechuguilla. Other middens may simply be dumps for kitchen-type debris, which contain sizeable

quantities of animal bones, broken stone tools, and flint-knapping detritus (Johnson 1995). Pedernales
peoples in particular may have been adept at both hunting and the processing of large volumes of plant
food materials.
The Late Archaic II interval (ca. 600 BC-AD 600) may have been a time of increasingly mesic conditions
for all but the western and southwestern portions of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson 1995). The onset of
more mesic conditions may have resulted in decreased numbers of upland xerophytic plants and perhaps
bison (Johnson 1995), which may have forced adjustments in prehistoric subsistence strategies. There
appears to be a decrease in the number of burned rock middens that can be directly attributable to the Late
Archaic II interval. The projectile points used at this time are smaller and are characterized by such styles
as Ensor, Fairland, Frio and Darl. Evidence suggests the large projectiles well-adapted to bison hunting
may have been gradually replaced. Also, it has been posited that the spread of Eastern Woodland
religious cults may have had an influence on the Late Archaic II peoples of Central Texas (Johnson
1995).
Late Prehistoric (ca. AD 600 - 1600)
The Late Prehistoric or Post-Archaic (ca. AD 600-1600) (Johnson 1995) in Central Texas is initially
marked by the replacement of the dart and atlatl with the bow and arrow, as reflected in the shift from dart
points to smaller, thinner and lighter arrow points (Ricklis and Collins 1994). Despite the shift to the bow
and arrow, there is strong indication that the broad based hunting-gathering economy of the Late Archaic
persisted into and throughout most of the Late Prehistoric period. The latter part of this period is marked
by the appearance of pottery and a distinctive complex of tools composed of contracting-stem Perdiz
arrow points, an abundance of unifacial end scrapers, thin, alternately beveled bifacial knives, and drills
or perforators made of flakes and blades. The Post-Archaic era again turned dry and somewhat arid
toward the middle of the Late Prehistoric, during which a dramatic increase in bison exploitation suggests
it became an increasingly important economic activity during the later part of this period.
Historic Period (AD 1528 â Present)
The most radical changes in the Native American history of Central Texas came during the historic era
(Black 1989). The horse was introduced into North America by Spanish settlers in the sixteenth century;
nomadic groups, initially the Apaches and later the Comanches, adopted the horse and rapidly altered the
aboriginal situation of Central Texas. These nomadic groups entered Central Texas from the plains and
mountains to the north and west and within 150 years had forced most of the native peoples to flee. Most
groups were destroyed by the combined effects of the nomadic raiders and the foreign diseases introduced
by Europeans. Others moved south, entering Spanish missions and settlements, or eastward to join
various agricultural groups such as the Wichita (Black 1989).
The historic period in Texas begins with the arrival of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and other survivors
of the Navarez expedition on the Texas coast in 1528, although there may have been earlier landings
(Cecil and Greene 2001). In any case, the influences of European colonization were not felt strongly in
Texas until several centuries later. By the middle of the eighteenth century, though, the Spanish had
established missions in East Texas and settlements in South Texas. This resulted in massive depopulation
and cultural disintegration among Native American groups.
The majority of historic period archeological sites in the vicinity of eastern Travis County and western
Bastrop County are historic farmsteads relating to the settlement and agriculture of the area, which was
founded in the 1850s but whose major period of settlement occurred after the Houston and Central Texas
Railway was built in 1871 (Smyrl 1996). Not surprisingly, these historic sites appear to conform to the
general dispersion pattern observed by Clark (2004), where settlement in the Blackland Prairies during

the nineteenth century tended to cluster along roads and other transportation arteries. Farmsteads were
typically located near a reliable water source, and houses were situated on hills overlooking creeks or
springs.

Previously Recorded Sites and Investigations

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES AND INVESTIGATIONS
A background review of the project area utilized the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THCâs) Online
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) to determine if there are any previously recorded archeological sites or
previously conducted surveys within the project area. In addition, the review identified any archeological
sites within 500 meters of the project area. While there are no sites recorded within the project area itself,
a single site, 41BP541, is recorded 50 meters south of the project location (Appendix A). This site,
recorded in 1999 by the LCRA during the Elgin Wastewater project survey, is a small (30 by 30 m),
prehistoric, open campsite consisting of a light scatter of burned rocks, chert flakes, a single biface, and a
possible Fairland projectile point. Site 41BP541 is located at the toe of a broad interfluvial lobe formed
by two intermittent drainages feeding into Elm Creek. In addition to the Elgin Waste Water project, two
additional surveys are recorded within the immediate vicinity of the proposed project boundary. One,
paralleling the existing US 290 right-of-way (ROW) approximately 60 meters from the project boundary,
was conducted on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation in 1987 and likely corresponds to the
original survey for US 290. The other, at a distance of 90 meters from the project boundary, was
conducted for the Farmerâs Home Administration (FMHA) in 1987. No sites were recorded within 500
meters of the proposed project area during either of these surveys.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
The field methodology utilized in the course of the archeological survey was tailored to provide the
broadest possible evaluation of cultural resources within the project area. This section provides an
overview of the field methodology and a discussion of the manner in which the historical archeological
resources found within and adjacent to the site area were evaluated for significance.
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a 100-percent intensive pedestrian survey of the project area
following the THC/CTAâs minimum survey standards for projects of less than 100 acres in size. At a
single location, a fallow agricultural field was encountered that exhibited 100 percent visibility in a
context that did not suggest deep site burial (confirmed through a single shovel test). This area was
visually inspected and photographed. All shovel tests were terminated at a maximum depth of 100
centimeters below ground surface unless pre-Holocene deposits, bedrock, or extremely dense clays were
encountered. All excavated soil from shovel tests was screened through Â¼-inch wire mesh or hand-sorted
where clays could not be screened. Each shovel test was recorded in ten-centimeter levels on
standardized forms and their location plotted using a GPS. Once test data were recorded, all shovel tests
were backfilled.
Backhoe trench excavations were designed to remove consecutive layers of earth in order to locate and
expose cultural features or occupation levels within areas exhibiting the potential for site burial. Within
the project area, deep quaternary-age alluvial sediments were mapped along the Elm Creek floodplain. At
these locales, backhoe trenches were excavated to discernible ancient sterile clays, typically around 150Â­
250 centimeters below the surface. Backhoe excavations were directed and monitored by an archeologist
certified as a competent person trained in Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) trench
safety standards. Sediment from representative bucket sweeps (approximately one of every four bucket
passes) was screened through Â¼-inch wire mesh. Each backhoe trench was recorded on a standardized
form with notes made regarding stratigraphy, features, and cultural artifacts. A soil profile, plan view
map, and photographs were recorded for each trench as warranted. After these data were recorded, the
backhoe trenches were backfilled.
Investigators used handheld GPS units and detailed maps to locate and record excavations within the
proposed project area. GPS positions were recorded for all shovel tests and backhoe trenches. All GPS
positions were downloaded and plotted on 7.5 minute USGS topographic maps and aerial photographs by
Hicks & Company Geographic Information Systems (GIS) personnel.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Test Summary
Archeologists performed a 100-percent intensive pedestrian survey supplemented by shovel testing of the
entire proposed project area. Due to high visibility and the level of disturbance within the southwestern
and southern portions of the project area, pedestrian survey alone was deemed sufficient during
investigations of these areas. As a result of recent plowing and planting, the likelihood for intact
archeological deposits was significantly reduced in this portion of the project area. The remaining project
area was surveyed through either a combination of transects and shovel tests or backhoe trenches and
shovel tests, depending on location. A total of 51 shovel tests were excavated during the current field
investigations, eight of which were located within the boundaries of Site 41BP855. None of the shovel
tests performed within the entire project area tested positive for cultural material.
Archeologists began investigations at the northwestern portion of the project area adjacent to the
intersection of County Line Road and the County Line Subdivision (Figure 9). Transects were performed
down-and-back from west to east until the area north of the plowed field, west of the housing complex
was fully investigated. This portion of the project area was characterized as an unplowed field with
nearly-complete grass cover, resulting in low surface visibility. Therefore, a total of 31 shovel tests were
placed at regular intervals approximately 75-100 meters apart within each transect. Soils observed in
these shovel tests were predominantly dark, thick clay loam (10YR3/1 to 10YR2/2) with occasional
lighter sand (10YR6/4 to 5YR4/2) at the surface. Shovel tests typically reached an average depth of 40
centimeters below ground surface (cmbgs), each terminating at impenetrable clay. Within the unplowed
field portion of the project area, orange natural chert cobbles were recovered below the surface, though no
evidence of cultural activity was noted.
Investigations were then conducted in the southern portion of the project area within an inundated plowed
field (Figure 10). As a result of plowing, the area had very little potential to contain intact archeological
deposits. One negative shovel test was performed in this area (JH23), revealing thick, disturbed clays.
Throughout most of this portion of the project area, high visibility and extensive disturbance made shovel
testing unnecessary (Figure 11). Full pedestrian survey of the plowed field resulted in no cultural
resources noted.
Archeologists subsequently investigated a portion of land on the edge of the floodplain above Elm Creek,
just east of the driveway adjacent to the plowed field within the project area. Due to recent rains, portions
of the area closest to US 290 were also inundated. Archeologists performed four shovel tests (SC20-21
and JH21-22) in the area, all of which were negative. Soils in SC20, just along the edge of the floodplain,
revealed likely-disturbed, mottled clay and loam (5YR5/4 to 5YR4/1). Closer to the creek, SC21, JH21
and JH22 revealed clay loam (10YR4/4) to depths reaching up to 50 cmbgs. No cultural materials were
recovered from any of these shovel tests; however, due to moderate to high potential for archeological
resources within the area along Elm Creek, backhoe trenches were performed at a later date (see Trench
Excavation Summary, below)
Eight shovel tests in the northeastern portion of the project area surrounding Site 41BP855 (JH5-7, JH25,
and JH27-30) revealed soils similar to those throughout the rest of the project area. Soils were
characterized as thick clay loam (7.5YR5/4 to 10YR4/4) with disturbance in the areas closest to the
housing complex. One shovel test (JH26) performed outside of the 41BP855 site boundary revealed
similar but drier soils than those closer to the housing complex.

Trench Excavation Summary
A total of six backhoe trenches (BHT 1-6) were excavated within the ACC Elgin tract project area
(Appendix A). Trenches were placed in level zero (T0) and level one terrace areas (T1) adjacent to Elm
Creek, where deep alluvial soils could potentially contain preserved archeological deposits.
Backhoe Trench 1
Backhoe Trench 1 (Figures 12 and 13) was excavated approximately 40 meters west of Elm Creek,
immediately south of the projectâs centerline. The first stratum extended to a depth of 40 centimeters
below the ground surface (cmbgs) and consisted of moist brown (10 YR 4/3) loams with moderate
amounts of calcium carbonate inclusions beginning at 40 cmbgs. Stratum 2 was observed to be a dry dark
yellowish clay loam (10 YR4/4) characterized by thick angular peds beginning at 40 cmbgs. Inclusions
included calcium carbonate and rounded river pebbles and gravels. Stratum 2 terminated at approximately
100 cmbgs. Stratum 3 sediment changed to a gummy and moist strong brown (7.5 YR 5/8) clay loam.
Peds were subangular and pebble and gravels inclusion continued. Beginning at 125 cmbgs, mottles (10Â­
20 percent) of grayish brown (10 YR 5/2) and reddish yellow (10 YR 6/8) were noted. No cultural
materials were noted during excavation, and Backhoe Trench 1 was terminated at 150 cmbgs in ancient,
sterile clay sediment.

Backhoe Trench 2
Backhoe Trench 2 (Figures 14 and 15) was placed approximately 30 meters south of BHT 1,
approximately 20 meters west of Elm Creek. During excavation, a large tabular sheet of concrete and
rebar was encountered at 35 cmbgs, suggesting subsurface disturbance and possible unmarked utilities.
At this point, BHT 2 was terminated. Sediment to 35 cmbgs was noted to be a crumbly brown (7.5 YR
5/8) clay with mottling of grayish brown (10 YR 5/2) and reddish yellow (10 YR 6/8). No cultural
materials where noted during excavation of BHT 2.

Backhoe Trench 3
Backhoe Trench 3 (Figures 16 and 17) was placed approximately 70 meters north of BHT 1 within a
broad T1 terrace landform. Stratum 1, extending to a depth of 65 cmbgs, was observed to be a soft loamy
10 YR 4/4) clay. Extending from 65 cmbgs to 95 cmbgs, Stratum 2 was observed to be a dense, crumbly
yellowish brown (10 YR 5/8) clay with high calcium carbonate precipitate content. Beginning at 95
cmbgs, Stratum 3 was noted as similar to Stratum 2 but devoid of calcium carbonate precipitate. Backhoe
Trench 3 was terminated at 161 cmbgs in ancient, sterile clay sediment. During excavation, no cultural
materials or features were noted, and BHT 3 was terminated at 195 cmbgs in ancient, sterile clay
sediment.

Backhoe Trench 4
Backhoe Trench 4 (Figure 18) was excavated north of BHT 3 near the center of a T1 terrace landform
located within the project area. Stratum 1 was observed to be a dark yellowish brown loam (10 YR 4/4)
with no inclusions beyond rootlets. At 30 cmbgs descending to a depth of 150 cmbgs, stratum 2 was
noted to be a light brown (10 YR 6/4) silty loam with increasing clay content. Intermittently throughout
stratum 2, mottling of pink (7.5 YR 7/4) silt loam was noted, occasionally forming very thin planar lenses
beginning at 50 cmbgs (Figure 18). During excavation of stratum 2, a historic-age bottle was recovered
from screening of sediment taken at 50-90 cmbgs (Figures 19 and 20).
Located in BHT 4's backfill at the 50-90 cmbgs level, an intact, 13 cm long by 5.2 cm wide by 3.9 cm
thick, clear historic bottle marked with "3iv" centered on the front shoulder was found. It is a mold made,
8-sided rectangular bottle with gently sloping shoulders featuring a small decorative shoulder ridge and a
short 3 cm long tapered neck ending in a slightly flared and rounded lip with smooth opening bore,
indicating it was corked. Two opposing mold seams are present on the short side corners and run from
the base to halfway up the neck, indicating hand finishing. A rectangular push-up on the base provides
additional structural support.

Backhoe Trench 5
In order to further explore the immediate area from which aforementioned â3ivâ historic-age bottle was
discovered, Backhoe Trench 5 (BHT 5) was placed perpendicular to BHT 4âs eastern terminus adjacent to
its north wall (Figure 21). During excavation of BHT 5, a single intact historic-age bottle was unearthed
in situ, and fragments of another where recovered from screening of the backdirt. They are described
below:
âAdolphous Buschâ
Found in situ 108 cmbgs along the side wall of BHT 5 (Figures 22 and 23), this intact, 24.2 cm long,
clear, rounded glass beer bottle features the classic beer bottle shape of a long round body, strong rounded
shoulders, a slightly expanding curved neck, and strong finish with rounded lip suitable for capping. Two
opposing mold seams begin at the rounded heels and end three quarters of the way up the neck, indicating
hand finishing. A slight, round push-up at the base features the âAB M 11â indicative of Adolphous
Busch Glass manufacturing dating between 1886 and 1928 (Berge 1980: 114-115).
âFamily Bittersâ
Found in backdirt at the 70 to 100 cmbgs level of BHT 5, this fragmented, amber-colored historic bottle
features a rectangular body shape with a rectangular though slightly rounded, beveled edge and depressed
body panels highlighting strongly raised letters (Figure 24). âFAMILYâ is centered within the obverse
depressed panel, while âBITTERSâ is placed on the reverse. Though the bottle length is indeterminable, a
width of approx 6.2 cm can be measured. The bitters (medicinal alcohol) trade reached its zenith in the
1860 to 1880 era, but some companies persisted through the 1920s (Odell 2010).

Results of Field Investigations

After discovery of the Adolphous Busch bottle in the west wall of BHT5, the trench was widened with the
intent of exposing, in plan view, any additional artifacts clustered in association with the Adolphous
Busch bottle (Figure 25). No additional artifacts were recovered during this expansion. Given the dates
associated with 41BP855 (described below), these bottles are likely associated with occupation of this
historic homestead. The stratigraphy of BHT 5 is the same as that described for BHT4.

Backhoe Trench 6
Backhoe Trench 6 was excavated near the northeastern extent of the project boundary within the higher
reaches of the T1 terrace formation (Figure 26). The profile for BHT 6 differed noticeably from that of
the aforementioned preceding trenches. Stratum 1 extended from surface to 48 cmbgs and was observed
to be a dark yellowish brown (10 YR 4/4) loam with increasing clay content. From approximately 40
cmbgs on into Stratum 2 there were moderate amounts of included rabdotus shell. At 48 cmbgs, there
occurs a distinct and abrupt transition to a thick moist strong brown (7.5 YR 5/8) clay loam with a very
high percentage of calcium carbonate precipitate. From sediment excavated from this stratum (Stratum
2), fragmented and crumbly animal bone was noted during screening (Figure 27). Stratum 2 extends to
an approximated depth of 126 cmbgs, where there is a gradual to diffuse transition to a dry strong brown
(7.5 YR 5/6) marking the upper boundary for Stratum 3. Within this stratum, there were numerous
inclusions of rounded pebbles and cobbles.

Site 41BP855
The project area for the ACC Elgin tract is in western Elgin, Bastrop County and is bounded by Elm
Creek to the east, US 290 to the south, County Line Subdivision to the north, and County Line Road to
the west. Within the northeast quad of this proposed ACC tract is Site 41BP855. Site 41BP855 is a
historic 1920s era homestead comprising an area of approximately 300 square meters. Along with the
wooden single-story main house, the site also includes several farm-related outbuildings (three barns, one
barn remnant, one garden shed, and one pump house), two wells, and an attached 1950s era garage all
organized upon a sparsely wooded oak and cedar grassy rise 275 meters west of Elm creek. Eight shovel
tests (JH5-7, JH25, and JH27-30) were performed within the historic site boundaries. All shovel tests
were negative for cultural materials. Trenching operations (n=6) were conducted on the eastern side of
the tract along the T1 terrace of Elm Creek. Trenches 4 and 5, located 250 m to the southeast of the main
house, yielded three historic bottles (3iv, Adolphous Busch, and Family Bitters) dating to the late 1800s
and early 1900s and were found in mixed sediments between 50 to 108 cmbgs. Current land use involves
cattle grazing and corn agriculture. Site 41BP855 is not eligible for SAL listing.

Property Area History
The ACC-Elgin tract is comprised of three parcels, each spanning portions of Bastrop and Travis
Counties, Texas.
Â

Â

R11915/ 358744 (31.09 acres; only a portion of the parcel north of US 290 is part of the project

The parcel is part of the Elizabeth Standifer survey, Abstract 24, and is currently owned by Elise
Neidig Family Partners of Elgin, Texas. A portion of the property, adjacent but not part of, the
project area includes historic-age structures (c 1920-1930s) house and four outbuildings).

Historic Structures Evaluation
The only standing structures in the project area are in parcel R11911. This tract has one residence and six
associated outbuildings.
Â 1 single family house
Â 3 barns
Â 1 barn remnant
Â 1 garden shed
Â 1 pump house
The single-story, single-family home is a side gable farmhouse with modest Craftsman detailing
including clipped gables, knee braces and exposed rafter tails. The house has horizontal wood siding,
corrugated metal roof, and concrete slab foundation. The house has a single front entry, which faces east
and is accessed through an inset front porch. The windows appear to be original, one-over-one wooden
sash, though the installation of metal and wood protective panels prohibited a full examination.
According to the Bastrop County Central Appraisal District, the residence was built in 1953, with an
attached garage constructed in 1961. Based on field observation, Hicks & Company Historians estimate
the house was likely constructed in the late 1920s to early 1930s and is clearly more than fifty years old.
The house has two sets of three windows facing south, one set on the north-south bay, and one set on the
east-west bay. The porch has a concrete floor and a shed roof with exposed rafters and one wooden
support post in the southeast corner.

Figure 28: South faÃ§ade of residential structure.
The east-west portion of the house has a clipped gable, or jerkin head, roof with triangular knee braces,
exhibiting some Craftsman-style characteristics. This side of the house has five windows, all covered with
protective panels at the time of the site visit.

The west faÃ§ade was not fully accessible due to fencing and site conditions (Figure 30). This side of the
house has the clipped-gable roof, with a projecting gable bay which appears to be original based on siding
and the knee braces. An addition obscures the majority of this elevation. A shed roof addition, possibly a
non-original side porch enclosed at a later date extends from the projecting bay.

On the rear elevation of the house, a garage has been connected to the structure by an addition. To the
east of the connection, on the main house, there are two windows, and the overhanging roof features
exposed rafter tails. The garage and connection have vertical panel wood siding, and the garage has two
bays with rolling metal doors and a single wooden entry door. The garage has a corrugated metal roof
and brick chimney. The garage appears to date from the 1950s and is likely not original to the house.
The connection appears to be a later and separate, building phase from the garage itself.

on the south faÃ§ade has lost its muntins, and none of the windows have glass. The east faÃ§ade of this
structure also has two windows, each with muntins to give the appearance of 2/2 divided lights. The
shelter structure extending to the west has a side-gabled corrugated metal roof and is enclosed on three
sides (open to the south). To the south of the garden shed, there is a well and pump house, which
provides shelter for above ground pipes (Figure 36). The structure has a pitched corrugated metal roof
and brick cladding. The well has an inscription in the concrete, likely a date, of â9-10-43.â

Evaluation and Summary
This property is typical of the farmsteads constructed in the area in the early to mid-twentieth century.
Although it retains its associated land and outbuildings, the house itself has been extensively altered and
lacks sufficient integrity to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), which is a
prerequisite for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation.

Historic Structures Adjacent to the Site
On part of parcel R11915/ 358744, there is a house and four associated outbuildings (Figures 37-40).
This portion of the property is not included in the project area, but will be immediately adjacent to the
development tract. This portion of the property also falls within Travis County, Texas.
The single-story, single-family home is a side-gabled farmhouse with Craftsman influences. Originally, it
appears to have been very similar the house on the adjacent parcel discussed above. The house has
horizontal clapboard siding (except for the rear elevation, which as vertical siding), a corrugated metal
roof, and a concrete slab foundation. The side-facing (east-west) gables are clipped gables with triangular
knee braces. The main entry faces south; the front porch of the house may have been enclosed at a later

date. The windows are generally, one-over-one wooden sash, with metal awnings. A single bay garage is
attached to the house on the east side, opening to the south. There is a second entry on the west faÃ§ade of
the house, under a shed roof supported by two square wooden posts.
According to the Travis County Central Appraisal District, the house was built in 1933. The data includes
effective year built for only one of the outbuildings, a barn, listed as built in 1933.

Results of Field Investigations

Evaluation and Summary
Similar to the previously discussed property (R11911) this is a typical early to mid-twentieth century
farmstead which retains its associated outbuildings and land. The house appears to have almost the same
original design as house on parcel R11911 and the two homes were likely built contemporaneously. This
house retains a higher level of integrity although the addition of a garage and enclosed porch on the front
elevation obscure the original design and would not be NRHP eligible under Criterion C for Architecture.
This property is located adjacent to the tract being purchased by ACC and will not be directly affected by
the project.

Conclusion and Recommendations

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Austin Community College and the City of Austin, Hicks & Company archeologists have
completed an areal 100-percent pedestrian survey along approximately 98 acres. The survey consisted of
pedestrian inspection supplemented by shovel testing (n=51) and mechanical trench excavations (n=6)
within the proposed projectâs footprint. The survey area was found to be a mixture of largely
undeveloped, open rangeland and farmland with, variably, deep, dense clays and clay loams that were
moderately inundated in some areas and upland clay loams. During survey, one historic-age farmstead
site was encountered and recorded as Site 41BP855. While largely intact, neither the main structure nor
associated outbuildings are considered eligible for listing as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
Based on the results of extensive backhoe trenching, shovel testing, and surface inspection, regulatory
clearance for the project is recommended to proceed with no further cultural resource coordination. In the
unlikely event that cultural materials are found during construction, all work in the areas are
recommended to cease until the THC can be contacted and a professional archeologist can assess the
finding and make recommendations for any future action that may be required.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of the requirement of ACT Permit #5747. Artifacts were
returned to their find location. All survey-generated documents, notes, and photographs will be curated at
TARL in Austin.
