ABSTRACT

A Phase 1 marine, cultural resources, remote-sensing survey was conducted of a
1190-acre area located on Halfmoon Reef in Matagorda Bay, Matagorda County, Texas. The
study was undertaken by Coastal Environments, Inc., of Corpus Christi, Texas. The area
surveyed consists of the majority of Halfmoon Reef, a large sand bank extending into
Matagorda Bay. Some portion of Halfmoon Reef is to be selected for a project intended to
reestablish oyster beds. The cultural resources survey encompassed several Texas State
Tracts identified by the Texas Historical Commission as high probability areas relative to
submerged cultural resources. In addition, the area surveyed included the former location of
the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse, which stood from 1858 to 1943. Remote-sensing
instruments used consisted of a marine magnetometer, side-scan sonar, and a fathometer. A
differential GPS system was used for positioning and navigation. A review of pertinent
geological, archeological, and historical records was undertaken prior to the survey to
determine the cultural resources potential of the project area. The only cultural features of
interest identified in the survey were magnetic anomalies and features identified on side-scan
sonar records that appear to represent elements associated with the iron frame foundation of
the former Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. Insufficient data were collected to make a
determination of eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places or as a Texas State
Archeological Landmark; however, the lighthouse has been assigned archaeological site
number 41MG135. This survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee
Archeology Permit Number 5429.

INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of a hydrographic and a Phase I, cultural resources
remote-sensing survey undertaken by Coastal Environments, Inc., (CEI) in response to plans
by the Nature Conservancy (TNC) of Texas to restore vital shellfish habitat to Halfmoon
Reef, located in Matagorda Bay in Matagorda County, Texas. This restoration plan will
involve the placement of base material to build structure for the reef, and then placement of a
capping material that is conducive to oyster spat attachment and oyster growth. Portions of
Halfmoon Reef include State tracts identified as high-probability areas for cultural resources
(i.e., historic shipwrecks and other underwater historic properties) as identified by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC). The remote-sensing survey was conducted across the entirety
of Halfmoon Reef to identify and evaluate the extent of submerged oyster reef habitat and the
presence of potentially significant cultural remains. Of particularly interest was the potential
for historic shipwrecks because of the hazard to shipping that Halfmoon Reef has
represented. Of additional interest were remains that might be associated with the Halfmoon
Reef Lighthouse, a structure built at the southwestern end of the reef in 1857-1858 and that
operated until 1942. The lighthouse structure was damaged by a hurricane in 1942, after
which it was sold. In 1943, the wooden structure was removed and later donated to Calhoun
County where it has been restored as a visitorâs center in the town of Port Lavaca. There is
no indication that the iron screw pilings on which the lighthouse building rested were ever
removed and they may still be there, in addition to debris and trash lost from the lighthouse
over its long period of use.
This document presents the results of the cultural resources remote-sensing survey.
Detailed results relating specifically to the oyster reef assessment and the viability of the
shellfish revitalization plan have been presented to the Nature Conservancy as a separate
document.
The Halfmoon Reef Project Area
Figure 1-1 depicts the project area, which constitutes that area within which the
remote-sensing survey was conducted. Halfmoon Reef (or âHalf Moon Reef,â as it was
commonly spelled in the nineteenth century and occasionally today) is a large, elongated
sand and shell bank extending in a southwest direction from Palacios Point into Matagorda
Bay (Figure 1-1). Historically, Halfmoon Reef was covered with a thick deposit of living
and dead oyster shell and was one of the important oyster producing habitats in Matagorda

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

Bay. However, today the reef contains almost no living oyster shell and what little dead shell
remains consists principally of small fragments best described as âshell hash.â Halfmoon
Reef lies at the juncture of two segments of Matagorda Bay. To the west, the bay is wide and
expansive, while east of Halfmoon Reef and Palacios Point, the bay is extremely narrow.
The project area encompasses all of Halfmoon Reef and measures 5.47 km long (3.39
miles) and 0.90 km (0.56 miles) wide. The northeastern portion of Halfmoon Reef falls
within Texas state tracts that are considered âsensitiveâ relative to the presence of submerged
cultural resources, such as shipwrecks. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) typically
requires cultural resources surveys in these high probability blocks when ground disturbing
impacts are anticipated, as in this project.

Chapter 1: Introduction

This study involved background historical research on the cultural, biological, and
geological aspects of Halfmoon Reef, in addition to the systematic remote-sensing survey.
The remote-sensing survey was designed to locate sunken vessels and other historic
submerged properties, as well as to identify and delineate oyster reef and shell habitat.
Following the requirements of the THC, survey transects were spaced 20 m apart to insure
complete and intensive coverage. The remote-sensing instruments used consisted of a
Geometrics Model 882SX cesium magnetometer, an Edgetech 4125P dual frequency sidescan sonar system, and a Syquest digital recording dual frequency fathometer. The side-scan
sonar was operated at a range setting to insure a minimum of 100 percent overlap on adjacent
lines. Accurate positioning was obtained with a Trimble Navigation DGPS based system
utilized with Hypack Max computer software to control navigation and data acquisition.
Texas South-Central State Plane coordinates, based on the 1927 North American Datum
(NAD27) coordinate system were employed for the survey. Details of the design and
conduct of the remote-sensing survey are discussed in Chapter 4 of this report.
In conjunction with the remote-sensing survey, data on the natural setting, previous
surveys of Halfmoon Reef, and shipwreck potential of the project area were collected. In
addition, detailed information on the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse was gathered, including
original plans and drawings from the National Archives in Washington D.C. This
information provided a background against which the results of the remote-sensing data
could be interpreted. The identification of possible shipwrecks relied on the information
available on the history of vessel use in the project area, on reported vessel losses, and on
past impacts that natural and man-induced activities may have had on wrecks in the project
area. Interpretation of remote-sensing data also drew upon the available literature on similar
shipwreck surveys. Each of these factors is discussed in the following chapters.
Previous Maritime Investigations in the Project Area
A considerable amount of marine archaeological research has been conducted in
Matagorda Bay. Much of this previous work has consisted of remote-sensing surveys
undertaken relative to oil and gas facilities or along navigation channels as elements of U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers projects. In regards to the latter category, Enright et al. (2002)
report on a remote-sensing survey along alternate routes of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway
Matagorda Bay; Pearson and Hudson (1990) report on a magnetometer survey of the
Matagorda Ship channel, located on the west side of Matagorda Bay; and Saltus (1990)
presents the results of a magnetometer survey of a navigation channel in Tres Palacios Bay.
None of these surveys located historically significant submerged resources. Only a couple of
the remote-sensing surveys conducted relative to oil and gas activities have been conducted
in the near vicinity of the Halfmoon Reef project area. These consist of surveys conducted
by PBS&J at well pads and along flow lines located in several State Tracts located a couple
of miles west of Halfmoon Reef (Jones et al 2005, 2006). Neither of these surveys recorded
historically significant cultural properties.
Few underwater projects in Matagorda Bay have involved the physical examination
of historic vessel remains. Hoyt (2005) reports on research conducted at the old port town of
Indianola on the west side of Matagorda Bay that included the examination of what is
believed to be the steamer Perseverance, lost in 1856. Several archaeological projects have

been conducted at Pass Cavallo, the entrance to Matagorda Bay, but the pass is located a
considerable distance from the present project area. The most significant marine
archaeological work conducted in Matagorda Bay was related to the discovery and
excavation of the seventeenth century wreck of the French vessel La Belle. This research
included a considerable amount of remote-sensing survey in the search for the vessel (Arnold
1996). In 1995, the wreck of La Belle, assigned site number 41MG86, was discovered in
southern Matagorda Bay, about 7.1 km southwest of Halfmoon Reef. In 1996 and 1997, the
Texas Historical Commission undertook excavation and recovery of the remains of La Belle
and this work is reported in Bruseth and Turner (2005) and Weddle (2001). Many consider
the La Belle project among the most important shipwreck studies undertaken in the United
States. Relatively little marine survey work has been conducted in the eastern part of the bay
and, apparently, none on or in the immediate vicinity of Halfmoon Reef.

NATURAL SETTING

The project area encompasses the submerged natural feature known as Halfmoon
Reef, located on the north shore of Matagorda Bay in Matagorda County, Texas. Although
identified as a âreef,â Halfmoon Reef is actually a large, submerged sand and shell bank
extending in a southwest direction from Palacios Point into Matagorda Bay (see Figure 1-1).
There are few living oysters on the reef at present.
Matagorda Bay, lying on the central Texas coast, is a portion of a network of bays
composed of East Matagorda Bay, Lavaca Bay, Matagorda Bay proper, plus several smaller,
connecting water bodies, specifically, Tres Palacios, Karankawa, and Keller bays (Figure 21). Matagorda Bay proper is about 26 km (16 mi) long (east-west) and, toward its western
end, about 19 km (12 mi) wide (north-south). However, at Palacios Point the bay abruptly
narrows to a width of about 7.2 km (4.5 mi). The narrow portion of the bay extends eastward
to the Colorado River Delta. Halfmoon Reef lies at the juncture of these two segments of
Matagorda Bay. The Matagorda Bay system represents the second largest embayment on the
Texas coast; only the Galveston Bay system is larger (Ward et al. 1980:1). Matagorda Bay is
a lagoonal estuary. Typical of Gulf Coast embayments, it is broad and shallow and nearly
isolated from the Gulf of Mexico by a barrier island-peninsula, in this instance, Matagorda
Island. Matagorda Bay is shallow, as are the other Texas bays, with a mean depth of only
about 3 m (10 ft). Numerous shoals exist in the bay, most commonly associated with oyster
(Crassostrea virginica) reefs (Ward et al. 1980:5). Halfmoon Reef is the largest of the shoals
in the bay.
Several streams flow into the Matagorda Bay system. The Lavaca and Navidad rivers
and smaller streams, such as Chocolate Bayou and Garcitas Creek, flow into Lavaca Bay.
This freshwater inflow makes salinities in Lavaca Bay lower than those in the main body of
Matagorda Bay. Flowing into the bay system from the north are streams such as Keller,
Karankawa, Turtle, and Reed creeks, and the Tres Palacios River. East Matagorda Bay is
separated from Matagorda Bay by the delta of the Colorado River. Rapid progradation of
this delta from the mainland to Bolivar Peninsula occurred between about 1929 and 1941,
isolating what is now East Matagorda Bay. This rapid period of delta development was
triggered by the elimination of an extensive log raft on the lower Colorado

River. The river, which formerly discharged into Matagorda Bay, now empties into the Gulf
of Mexico.
Geologic History
The Matagorda embayment system began to gradually evolve into its present
condition and configuration between about 2,500 and 3,000 years B.P. The processes of
erosion, deposition, compaction, and subsidence combined to mold landforms and bodies of
water which were formed during the Pleistocene and Holocene episodes. Prior to 10,000
years ago, with sea level much lower than at present, the area of Matagorda Bay was dry
land, a portion of the coastal plain situated some distance from the Gulf of Mexico. The now
filled and buried late Pleistocene-age channels of the Lavaca-Navidad River system underlie
the western portion of Matagorda Bay (McGowen et al. 1976:16). These deeply incised
channels were created during a period of low sea level in the late Pleistocene which began
about 50,000 to 60,000 years B.P. By about 25,000 years B.P. sea level had dropped as
much as 120 m (400 ft) below its present level, causing extensive downcutting of streams
into the older, underlying fluvial and deltaic deposits. At the time of lowest sea level, the
shoreline was about 80 km (50 mi) south of the Modem Gulf shoreline. .
Beginning about 18,000 years B.P., sea level began to rise with the melting of the
continental glaciers. The coastal valleys were slowly inundated and filled, first with
estuarine and finally with marine sediments. By about 9,500 years ago, the sea had
inundated the Lavaca-Navidad valley to the present area of Lavaca Bay and, presumably, the
valley of the ancestral Tres Palacios River to the area of Tres Palacios Bay. In fact, Gulf
waters extended inland along the incised valleys as far as 40 km (25 mi) or so from its
present shoreline (McGowen et al. 1976:16).
The formation of Matagorda Bay proper began when it became separated from the
open Gulf by the development of Matagorda Peninsula, and Matagorda and St. Joseph
Islands. This development began with the slowing and stabilizing of sea level between about
2,500 and 3,000 years ago. As a result of wave action, sediments began to accumulate to
form a series of shoals, probably on top of Pleistocene topographic highs. These shoals
developed into barrier island nuclei, fed by sands derived from the underlying and adjacent
Pleistocene strandplain features and from the erosion of offshore fluvial deltaic deposits.
Prior to about 1,800 years B.P., Matagorda Peninsula consisted of a series of spits, islands,
and shoals. After that date, fine-grained sediments from the Brazos and Colorado rivers
began to discharge into the area. The accumulation of sediments resulted in the coalescence
of the disconnected islands into the present-day Matagorda Peninsula, and the formation of
Matagorda Bay (McGowen et al. 1976:16). Just down the coast, incipient islands coalesced
through spit accretion and tidal pass filling to form Matagorda and St. Joseph islands,
creating Aransas, San Antonio, Espiritu Santo, and associated bays and lagoons.
With the stabilization of sea level, Matagorda Bay began to take on its Modern
aspect. Shoreline features were smoothed by wave erosion; shallow tributary bays, such as
Karankawa and Keller bays, and Powderhorn Lake, were isolated as a result of spit accretion
across their entrances. River borne sediments began to fill Matagorda Bay. The Lavaca and

7

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

Navidad rivers have filled their estuaries since stillstand, and a delta, measuring almost 5 km
(3 mi) long, has prograded into Lavaca Bay. Additionally, marshes and swamps began to
develop around the northern periphery of the bay, particularly, in association with the
bayhead deltas.
Since its formation, Matagorda Peninsula has remained a low profile, transgressive
feature, consisting of a relatively thin deposit of sand (generally less than 6 m thick)
overlying estuarine muds (Morton and McGowen 1980:141-143). Storm surges in the 1.5- to
2-m range wash over the peninsula and washover fans are numerous. Larger storms may
create passes through the peninsula, most of which fill quickly, while some may remain open
for years. In general, the entire Matagorda Peninsula shoreline is eroding and the entire
feature is transgressing landward. Rates of shoreline change vary, but, along portions of the
peninsula, shoreline retreat is greater than 3 m per year (McGowen et al. 1976:83). The
western end of the peninsula has demonstrated less retreat than the eastern end in recent
years.
Currently, there are five principal inlets connecting the Matagorda Bay system with
the Gulf of Mexico. These are Pass Cavallo, Matagorda Ship Channel land cut, Greens
Bayou, the Colorado River Mouth complex, and Brown Cedar Cut (Ward et al. 1980:9). The
first three open into Matagorda Bay proper. Pass Cavallo is a natural entrance into the bay
and was the only permanent inlet for the Matagorda Bay system prior to the construction of
the Matagorda Entrance Channel land cut in 1963. This pass has served as the historic
shipping entrance to the bay, although it has always been relatively dangerous because of its
instability. In fact, it was off this pass that the French explorer La Salle lost his ship
lâAimable in 1685. The primary tidal channel through Pass Cavallo is Pass Gorge, and it
seems to be the most stable element of the pass, demonstrating little morphological change
for at least the past 300 years. The eastern channel, known as Decrows Channel, is not
nearly as stable. The element showing the greatest amount of change in the Pass Cavallo
system is the Pelican Shoal complex, located at the Gulf-side entrance to the pass. This large
sand flat has, over the years, varied considerably in size and configuration, affecting the
depth and specific position of the entrances to the pass.
The most significant alteration to the morphology of Pass Cavallo in recent history
has been the accretion of an elongated spit from the south beach of Matagorda Peninsula.
During 1878-1887 an effort to stabilize Pass Cavallo was made with the construction of a
jetty intended to focus current into Pass Gorge and keep the Gulf bar scoured out.
Apparently, the jetty was unsuccessful (Ward et al. 1980:9).
The other major entrance into Matagorda Bay is the Matagorda Ship Channel land
cut. This artificial channel was dug through Matagorda Peninsula in 1963. An extremely
strong current through this cut has kept it open without dredging. Soon after construction,
the current enlarged the cutâs initial dimensions from 11 m (38 ft) deep to over 15 m (50 ft)
deep, and from 90 m (300 ft) wide to over 300 m (1000 ft) wide. The banks have since been
revetted and stabilized to prevent further widening.

8

Chapter 2: Natural Setting

Along the length of Matagorda Peninsula are numerous low areas that are breached
periodically during storms, but which normally close relatively quickly. Some of these
"storm passes" are sufficiently permanent to be named. Greens Bayou is the most important
of these washover passes opening into western Matagorda Bay. The size of the bayou varies
considerably, depending upon the timing, size, and duration of storms. After a major
hurricane, Greens Bayou can grow to as much as 2 km wide, but, typically, it fills and closes
relatively quickly as a result of littoral drift (Ward et al. 1980:14). Storm washovers such as
Greens Bayou may have intermittently served as routes for small boats, but were never
important navigation passes.
Halfmoon Reef
Halfmoon Reef probably initially formed as a large, submerged sand shoal extending
into Matagorda Bay from Palacios Point. Today this shoal is an elongated feature measuring
approximately 5.5 km (3.4 mi) long and about 1 km (0.6 mi) wide. Halfmoon Reef makes a
slight curve to the south near its western end, possibly giving rise to its name. The spelling
of the reefâs name has changed over time. In the past 70 years or so, the name has been
typically spelled as one word, âHalfmoon.â However, in earlier years it was most often
spelled as two words âHalf Moon.â The modern form of the name is used in this document.
The processes that formed Halfmoon Reef are not fully understood; however, the
feature appears to have formed on the same elevated Pleistocene land surface that forms
Palacios Point. Apparently, this ridge feature, now submerged, extends to the southwest
from present-day Palacios Point. Cores and borings made during the present study indicate
that the ridge consisted of tenacious clays of the Pleistocene Beaumont formation that
extended out as exposures on the shallow bay floor. Currents and waves within Matagorda
Bay combined to deposit sandy sediments on this submerged ridge and, subsequently,
conditions led to the development of oyster reefs on this sandy feature, leading to its
stabilization and vertical accretion. Over time, the accumulated dead and living oysters
extended above the water surface, at least during periods of low water. Halfmoon Reef
proper is separated from Palacios Point by a narrow stretch of slightly deeper water,
historically known as Palacios Channel or Palacios Point Channel. This channel served as a
navigation route for small vessels traveling between the eastern portion of Matagorda Bay
and the vicinity of Tres Palacios Bay and the town of Palacios (Moore 1907:20).
Today, water depths over the highest portions of Halfmoon Reef are about 1.5 m (5
ft) at low water, approximately one-half the depth of the surrounding bay bottom (see Figure
1-1). However, in the recent past, the reef was higher, in part related to extensive oyster beds
that once covered much of the feature. One of the early accurate maps of Matagorda Bay,
produced by Topographical Engineers in 1846-1847, depicts the reef as a long, thin feature,
rising above the surface of the water (Figure 2-2). It is presumed that the exposed portion of
the reef consisted of living oyster beds. This map shows that the water depths of Matagorda
Bay in the vicinity of the reef were about 11 to 13 ft, approximately the same as today. In
1907, Halfmoon Reef was described as an âeconomically importantâ oyster reef that
measured about 2.95 miles long and 0.28 miles wide, encompassing close to 500 acres
(Moore 1907:20). At that time, water depths over the spine of the reef were less than one

foot during low water and oyster beds and oyster shell were described as stretching almost
the entire length of the reef and the shell and shell fragments were up to four feet thick. As
late as 1934, navigation charts showed that water depths over Halfmoon Reef were as little
as one foot (Figure 2-3).
The large oyster reefs that once blanketed Halfmoon Reef are now gone and
oystermen report that only a few oysters grow on the reef, particularly at its northeastern
end near Palacios Point (Blackie Longaria, personal communication 2009). The
disappearance of oysters from Halfmoon Reef since the early years of the twentieth
century is not totally understood; some of it may be related to over fishing of the reef
during the early years of the twentieth century. However, even as early as 1907, it was
noted that few young oysters were growing on the reef (Moore 1907). It is likely that
environmental changes in Matagorda Bay, particularly changing water salinities and
currents, have been most responsible for the disappearance of oysters over the past

century. Possibly the most dramatic changes have resulted from the development of the
Colorado River Delta in the 1920s and 1930s, forcing the Colorado River to discharge into
the Gulf of Mexico, rather than into the eastern end of Matagorda Bay, as it had done in the
past. This change significantly reduced the amount of freshwater flowing into this portion of

11

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

the bay, dramatically altering the current flows in the bay and resulting in increased salinities.
In addition, agricultural and residential development around the bay has resulted in numerous
changes to the flow patterns of streams discharging into the bay. All of these factors have
significantly altered the bayâs ecology over the past 100 years or so and impacted oyster
habitats.
Of some interest is that the recent disappearance of oysters from Halfmoon Reef does
not seem to be a unique event. In his study on the conditions of oysters in Matagorda Bay
made in 1905, H. F. Moore (1907:20) reported that witnesses stated no marketable oysters
grew on Halfmoon Reef in 1895. This was only a decade prior to Mooreâs discovery of
about 500 acres of commercially viable oyster beds covering the reef. By 1902, oysters large
enough to harvest were again growing on the reef. However, Mooreâs discovery that the reef
consisted of shell measuring 3 to 4 ft thick led him to conclude that it was a âvery old reefâ
(Moore 1907:20). This suggests that the report of no oysters on the reef in 1895 referred to
live oysters, not dead shell, in contrast to the present situation, where even dead shell has
largely disappeared.
The shallow waters over Halfmoon Reef represented a significant hazard to vessels
traveling in Matagorda Bay, especially those traveling eastward to the town of Matagorda at
the mouth of the Colorado River, once an important Texas port. Because of this, a lighthouse
was erected near the southwestern end of the reef in 1857-1858 (see Figure 2-3). This screw
pile lighthouse stood until it was removed in 1943, by which time it had outlived its
usefulness. A detailed discussion of this lighthouse is presented in Chapter 3. Commercial
boat traffic is still fairly heavy in Matagorda Bay, particularly along the Gulf Intracoastal
Waterway, a portion of which passes just a few miles southeast of Halfmoon Reef. Because
Halfmoon Reef still represents a hazard to boat traffic, after the removal of the Halfmoon
Reef Lighthouse, a warning light was placed at the extreme southwestern tip of the reef.

CHAPTER 3

SETTLEMENT AND
NAVIGATION HISTORY OF
THE PROJECT AREA

Exploration and Settlement
The navigation history of the project area, and particularly the record of vessel losses,
is the most critical aspect of regional history for the present study. Settlement history is
closely tied to navigation history, so this chapter deals with both topics for the Matagorda
Bay area and, where data are available, for the Halfmoon Reef vicinity specifically.
The Matagorda Bay area has been the locus of vessel activity since prehistoric times.
Early historic accounts reveal that the aboriginal populations utilized dugout canoes in their
travels around Matagorda Bay. However, little is known about prehistoric waterborne
activity in the area and it is not until the arrival of Europeans that information on navigation
of the bay becomes available. The coastal area around Matagorda Bay is characterized by
barren and sandy beaches and islands and was considered inhospitable by the earliest
European explorers. As a result, Europeans sporadically visited the area for almost two
centuries before any attempts at settlement were made. In 1519, possibly the first of these
European explorers, Alonso Alvarez de Pineda, explored and mapped the Gulf coast from
Apalachicola to Yucatan (Weddle 1985). The map produced by de Pineda seems to show
Matagorda Bay and gives it the name âBahia de Espiritu Santo.â In 1558, Guido de
Lavazares sailed northward from San Juan de Ulua on the eastern coast of Mexico to
âexplore the ports and bays on the coast of Floridaâ (Weddle 1985:257). At 28o 30â north
latitude, Lavazares discovered a large bay that he named âSan Francisco,â where he went
ashore and claimed the land for the Spanish crown. Weddle (1985:258) suggests that this
was Matagorda Bay.
The first attempt at settlement in the Matagorda Bay area was made by the French
under Rene-Robert Cavalier, Sieur de La Salle. La Salle had reached the Gulf of Mexico
from the north in 1682, by way of the Mississippi River. Returning to France, he
successfully campaigned for permission to establish a French colony at the mouth of the
Mississippi, hoping to control both the northern Gulf of Mexico and to establish a base from
which to attack the Spanish. Of particular interest to the French were the Spanish silver

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

mines of northern Mexico. In July 1684, La Salle, left France with four ships and about three
hundred people, bound for the mouth of the Mississippi River. Whether as a result of less
than reliable navigation or of secret alternative plans, in February 1685 La Salle and his
company arrived instead at Pass Cavallo, the entrance to Matagorda Bay (Bruseth and Turner
2005:25; Stephens and Holmes 1989:Map 11).
One of the party's ships, the ketch Saint-FranÃ§ois, loaded with tools and provisions,
was lost to Spanish buccaneers on the journey and never reached Texas (Bruseth and Turner
2005:21). A second ship, the lâAimable, was lost at Pass Cavallo on February 20, 1685. The
lâAimable was a vessel described as a "flute" of 250 to 300 tons carrying four cannons, 1,620
cannon balls, 400 grenades, 4,000 pounds of iron, 5,000 pounds of lead, most of the settlerâs
remaining tools, a forge, a mill, cordage, boxes of arms, medicines, and baggage (Scurlock
1971:3). Accounts of the La Salle expedition record that the lâAimable ran aground while
trying to enter Matagorda Bay through Pass Cavallo. There are suggestions that the
commander of the lâAimable, Captain Aigron, intentionally ran his ship aground because of
his belief that La Salle had missed the Mississippi River and taken the expedition too far to
the west (Bruseth and Turner 2005:26). The lâAimable reportedly grounded a "cannonshot"
from shore and was exposed for several days before it finally broke up. The lâAimable
carried a large portion of the expeditionâs supplies and the French were able to recover only a
portion of the cargo from the vessel (Weddle et al. 1987:108-111,226).
In March 1685, the Le Joly, the flagship of the expedition, returned to France; after a
disagreement with La Salle, her captain refused to surrender the cannon and ammunition
aboard, claiming to need the ballast (Stephens and Holmes 1989:Map 12). La Salle, left with
only 180 of the original 300 or so colonist, sought a safe place for a permanent settlement
farther inland. He eventually established a permanent camp, named Fort Saint Louis, on
Garcitas Creek at the head of Lavaca Bay. Without the supplies from the lâAimable,
colonization was a struggle, which only became more difficult over time. In February 1686,
while La Salle and an exploration party were away, the last remaining ship in his fleet, La
Belle, described as a "barque longue,â or light frigate, approximately 55 ft long, was lost
along the inside of the Matagorda Peninsula during a squall. La Belle, laden with a
considerable portion of the remaining supplies for the colony, had been anchored on the
north shore of Matagorda Bay when the squall hit and she was driven to the southern side of
the bay where she ran aground just off Matagorda Peninsula, not too far from present-day
Greens Bayou. Only six of the 26 people aboard La Belle survived the storm and sinking and
eventually made it back to the main settlement at Fort St. Louis (Bruseth and Turner 2005:56). In 1995, the wreck of La Belle was discovered in the shallow waters of southern
Matagorda Bay, only a few miles southwest of Halfmoon Reef. In 1996 and 1997, the Texas
Historical Commission, with funding from the state of Texas, undertook excavation of the
wreck of La Belle. A large, sheet pile cofferdam was constructed around the wreck, the
water was pumped from inside of the cofferdam and the ship was fully excavated and,
ultimately, entirely removed. Thousands of seventeenth century French artifacts, including
approximately 40 percent of the hull of La Belle were recovered. The wreck of La Belle
represents possibly the most important historic shipwreck ever discovered in the United
States and several publications on the history and archaeology of the ship have been
produced, although many of the artifacts recovered are still being conserved and analyzed
(Bruseth and Turner 2005; Weddle 2001).

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

In March 1687, La Salle was murdered by disaffected members of the expedition
while attempting to find his way to the French settlements on the Great Lakes. The colonists
he left behind on Lavaca Bay did not fare well, most succumbing to the depredations of
Indians or disease. Receiving reports that French were within their territory, the Spanish sent
out expeditions to locate the colony. Alonso de LeÃ³n, a Spaniard of Mexican birth serving as
Governor of Coahuila, made several attempts to search for the French, as well as to colonize
Texas, reaching only as far as the Rio Grande on his first expedition in 1686. On a second
attempt the following year, de LeÃ³n crossed the Rio Grande and reached the area of Baffin
Bay.
In 1688, de LeÃ³n heard rumors of a Frenchman living as a chieftain among the
Indians. Mounting another expedition, he succeeded in finding and taking prisoner Jean
Henri, an apparent deserter from La Salleâs settlement. Henri served as a guide for the
Spanish, who eventually discovered the abandoned and decrepit site of Fort St. Louis in
April 1689. De LeÃ³n intended to establish a settlement at or near Fort St. Louis, but bad
weather forced an end to his colonization effort and the expedition returned to Mexico.
However, the following year, de Leon returned and burned what little remained of Fort St.
Louis (Webb 1952:1:483-484, 798; 2:552). The Spanish, also, found the eight iron cannons
that La Salle had removed from lâAimable and placed at the fort. De LeÃ³n buried the
cannons, intending to recover them at a later date (Bruseth and Turner 2005:28). De LeÃ³n
and his party continued north and established the mission of San Francisco de los Tejas on
the Neches River and also retrieved five remaining survivors of la Salleâs colony who were
being held by the Indians (Weddle et al. 1987:214-215).
The Spanish returned to the area in 1722 to establish a presidio and mission on the
site of Fort Saint Louis; however this settlement was moved inland to the Guadalupe River in
1749 (Stephens and Holmes 1989:Map 12). By this time, the location of the buried cannons
was forgotten and they were never recovered. However, in 1996 the cannons were
discovered and subsequently excavated by the Texas Historical Commission. The discovery
of the cannons ended a long-standing controversy about the location of Fort St. Louis
(Bruseth and Turner 2005).
Another Spanish effort to find the French in 1686-1687 was undertaken by water.
The Spanish pilot Juan EnrÃ­quez Barroto left an account of this venture. The expedition,
under the command of Captain MartÃ­n de Rivas, departed from Veracruz traveling along the
coast in two, large, shallow-draft sailing âpiraguesâ (Weddle et al. 1987:129-203). On
reaching Matagorda Bay in the spring of 1687, the Spaniards found the wrecks of lâAimable
and La Belle, but did not find the French colonists (Weddle et al. 1987:129-130). De Rivasâ
expedition did explore the area of present-day Matagorda Bay, which they named âLago de
San Bernardo.â
In 1690, another expedition set out to find the French at Matagorda Bay. This
expedition sailed from Vera Cruz in October aboard the frigate Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la
EncarnaciÃ³n under the command of Francisco de Llanos. Llanos and his party were to map
San Bernardo Bay, or âEspiritu Santo Bayâ as it was also known, and to determine the
suitability of Fort St. Louis as the location for a future Spanish presidio. Manuel JosÃ© de
CÃ¡rdenas y MagaÃ±a, an engineer, was along to map the bay and surrounding area. The
expedition traveled all around Matagorda Bay, explored up the Navidad and Lavaca rivers,

15

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

and visited the site of Fort St. Louis collecting information for de CÃ¡rdenasâ map (Weddle
2009).
Figure 3-1 presents a seventeenth-century Spanish map of the Matagorda Bay area,
apparently the result of the Llanos-CÃ¡rdenas expedition and the various other expeditions
sent out to find La Salleâs settlement. This map indicates the extent of regional knowledge
the Spanish had obtained of the area by the late 1600s. Principal features, such as Matagorda
Bay (âKâ called âLago de San Bernardoâ), Lavaca Bay (âJâ called âLago Todos Santosâ),
and Matagorda Peninsula are accurately depicted. Tres Palacios Bay, in the northeastern
corner of Matagorda Bay, and the Colorado River (âMâ called âRio de la Trinidadâ), are also
accurately shown. The site of La Salleâs settlement, Fort St. Louis, is identified as âPueblo
de los Franceses.â This map even seems to show shallow water extending out from the area
of Palacios Point, possibly a depiction of the large and obvious shoal produced by Halfmoon
Reef.

Figure 3-1. Late seventeenth century Spanish map of the Matagorda Bay area. The red
circle denotes shallow water extending out from present-day Palacios Point,
possibly a depiction of Halfmoon Reef (Weddle et al. 1987:Plate 10).

Despite the failure of the La Salle effort, the French did not entirely abandon their
interest in the Texas coastal area. Two expeditions were sent to map the area, the first under
Jean BÃ©ranger, who in 1720 left five men to hold Matagorda Bay for France under the
mistaken impression that it was Galveston Bay, and a second under Bernard de la Harpe

16

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

(Gutherie 1988:114; Webb 1952:1:148). The Spanish responded in earnest to these and other
French incursions with an expeditionary force of about 500 men led by the newly-appointed
governor of Coahuila and Texas, the MarquÃ©s of San Miguel de Aguayo. Aguayo drove the
French out of east Texas and established a presidio and mission near the French post of
Natchitoches on the Red River in present-day northern Louisiana. He sent a secondary force
to reoccupy the region of Matagorda Bay, now known to the Spanish as âLa BahÃ­a del
EspÃ­ritu Santo.â Aguayo established the presidio of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Loreta on the site of
the old French Fort St. Louis (Garcitas Creek) and erected a nearby mission, Nuestra SeÃ±ora
del EspÃ­ritu Santo de ZÃºÃ±iga. The mission and presidio, known collectively as "La BahÃ­a,"
were moved in 1726 to the Guadalupe River and, in 1749, to the San Antonio River near
modern-day Goliad (Webb 1952:1:17, 2:1).
The next Spaniard to visit the region seems to have been OrtÃ­z Parrilla who, in
September 1766, left the Rio Grande for La BahÃ­a. He explored down the Guadalupe River
and then across land to Matagorda Bay, perhaps reaching the bay in the area of present-day
Indianola (Huson 1935:73). Between 1766 and 1785, the Spanish evidently explored and
charted the much of this coastal area, because maps become more detailed during this period.
However, these expeditions are not well known. During this time there seems to have been a
small amount of boat traffic on Matagorda Bay, principally to supply the missions
established in the area. In 1782, the interim commander of the presidio of Nuestra Senora de
Loreto (Goliad) requested that a fortification be constructed at Matagorda Bay to help protect
shipping from depredations by the Indians (Guthrie 1988:114). This request was apparently
never acted upon, but it does indicate vessel activity on Matagorda Bay.
Between 1783 and 1786, the pilot JosÃ© de EvÃ­a, at the request of Governor Bernardo
de GÃ¡lvez, made a careful study of the Gulf coast. This resulted in the 1799 Carta EsfÃ©rica
que Comprehende las Costas del Seno Mexicano Construida de Orden del Rey, by Juan de
LÃ¡ngara of the Spanish Hydrographic Service. EvÃ­a examined and mapped Matagorda Bay
(Hackett 1931:440-442).
Early Nineteenth Century Mexican and Anglo-Texan Period
The Matagorda Bay area remained quiet during the final decades of the eighteenth
century, but in the early nineteenth century the bay was at least visited by the pirate
community that made its headquarters on Galveston Island. In 1817, an associate of Jean
Lafitte called d'Autrey entered the bay with a fleet of 13 ships, some of them prizes, possibly
anchoring in the Saluria Bayou area at the eastern end of Matagorda Island. The pirates
reportedly burned the ships they could not man and departed in the remaining vessels
(Arnold 1982:24).
The Mexican War of Independence (1811-1821) had little direct impact on the
Matagorda Bay area. In 1824, the Mexican Congress incorporated all of Texas into a new
state, Coahuila y Texas, with the capital at Saltillo. States were granted the power to set
immigration laws, and the state legislature of Coahuila y Texas, wishing to encourage
settlement, established the empresario system, a decision that would have great and lasting
impact on the settlement of the region. Empresarios were men given permits and land grants
by the government to bring settlers into the region. The Americans, Moses Austin and his
son, Stephen F. Austin, were the most important of the empresarios. In 1821, Stephen Austin

17

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

was granted permission to explore Texas in a search for lands for colonists. Austin traveled
along much of the Texas coast during this examination, and, ultimately, selected for his
colony an area on the central Texas coast lying between the Lavaca and Brazos rivers, the
western portion of which bordered on Matagorda Bay. Eventually, the state legislature of
Coahuila y Texas granted no less than two dozen empresario contracts similar to Austin's and
the settlement of Texas turned into a virtual land rush (Haley 1985:19).
The eastern portion of Matagorda Bay, roughly that area which is now in present-day
Matagorda County, fell within the large and well-known Stephen F. Austin colony, while the
western portion, now in Calhoun and Jackson counties, was part of a grant awarded to Martin
de Leon (Stephens and Holmes 1989:Map 22). De Leon's colony, which included Irish and
American, as well as Mexican, settlers, grew into the town Victoria on the Guadalupe River
(Webb 1952:1:484).
The majority of American settlers in Texas in the 1820s were not actively interested
in separation from Mexico, but they did want a greater say in their own government. A
Mexican law enacted on April 6, 1830, supported military occupation of Texas, increased
colonization by Mexicans and Europeans, particularly immigrants from Germany and
Switzerland, while forbidding further settlers from the United States, and urged the
establishment of more coastwise trade between Texas and Mexico. The American settlers,
upset with the restriction on immigration from the United States, responded with the
Convention of 1832, which met in San Felipe de Austin and aired various complaints against
the Mexican government, and with the Second Convention in April 1833 that met to write a
constitution for the (still Mexican) state of Texas. That spring, Stephen Austin traveled to
Mexico City with hopes of negotiating the differences between the settlers and the
government, but he was jailed by the authorities there, and did not return to Texas until
September 1835 (Haley 1985:28-29).
Worried about the increasing Anglo-Texan colonist situation, in 1834 the Mexican
government sent General Juan N. Almonte to Texas on a tour of inspection. As a result of
Almonteâs trip, the Mexican government took several actions in an effort to control the
spread of Anglo influence in Texas. None of these interventions by the Mexican government
helped and in 1835 armed rebellion broke out. Ultimately, the Mexican army was defeated
by Texans at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, and the Republic of Texas was
founded.
Post Independence History, 1836-Present
With the end of hostilities, settlement and economic growth of the region again
resumed. After independence in 1836, Matagorda County was organized as one of the first
twenty-three counties in the Republic of Texas. The town of Matagorda, located at the
mouth of the Colorado River in eastern Matagorda Bay, was designated as the county seat
and a port of entry (Figure 3-2). In 1845, Texas was annexed as a state by the United States.
Subsequently, Matagorda County developed into an agricultural and livestock raising region.
Cotton became the principal crop, although a considerable amount of sugarcane was grown.
Between 1850 and 1855, large numbers of black slaves were brought into the county,
principally by slaveholders from Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia, to work on
plantations in the bottomlands of the Colorado River and Caney Creek. The area between

18

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

the towns of Matagorda and Brazoria, situated forty miles to the east, came to be known as
"Old Caney" and was noted for its production of cotton and sugar. By 1850, there were
2,124 people living in Matagorda County, including 913 whites, 1,208 slaves, and 3 free
blacks (Kleiner 2009a).

town of Matagorda, at the mouth of the Colorado River in the lower right of the figure,
was the earliest town established on the bay. The location of Halfmoon Reef is circled in
red (Board of Engineers 1846).

In a special election held in early 1861, the county overwhelming supported secession
from the Union. Several Confederate camps and garrisons were established in the area.
These included DeCrow's Battery on the southwestern tip of Matagorda Peninsula to guard
the east channel to Matagorda Bay and Fort Caney, at the mouth of Caney Creek. In 1861
and 1862, the Federal Navy established a blockade off the Gulf coast, in an effort to stop
vessel traffic into and out of the Confederacy. The Confederate gunboat John H. Carr was
anchored at Matagorda, along with the Lizzie Lake, a stern wheeler, and a transport called the
Lucy Guinn.
Few Federal land forces entered Matagorda County during the war, but Matagorda
Bay saw a considerable amount of military activity. At the start of the war, Pass Cavallo was
defended by Fort Esperanza and its associated earthworks and batteries located at the eastern
end of Matagorda Island near Saluria (Arnold 1982:29). Action in the area began fairly early
in the war, when Confederate forces seized the steamer Star of the West at Indianola on April
19, 1861. On April 25, the Federal troops stationed at Saluria surrendered (Naval History
Division 1971:1:2-9; Long 1971:65).

19

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

On October 25, 1862, Union ships forced the entrance at Pass Cavallo, and the
Confederate forces abandoned Fort Esperanza rather than be cut off from Indianola (Arnold
1982:29). The following day, Indianola was captured by Union gunboats. This force, led by
the U.S.S. Westfield and Clifton, continued into Lavaca Bay where it spent October 31 and
November 1 unsuccessfully bombarding Port Lavaca. The Westfield and Clifton had
previously captured the schooner Lecompte, a Confederate vessel operating in Matagorda
Bay (Naval History Division 1971:6:261; Long 1971:282-283). On November 20,
Confederates captured a boat crew from the U.S. mortar schooner Henry James when the
men went ashore near Matagorda to secure fresh beef (Naval History Division 1971:2:110).
The Federal incursion of 1862 was not permanent; Union forces left the bay and Fort
Esperanza was reoccupied and held by Confederate forces for most of 1863. During this
time, one Confederate officer, a Captain Bradbury whose family operated a foundry in Port
Lavaca, anchored eighteen mines (which he had probably built himself) across the channel
through Pass Cavallo. These did seem to serve as a deterrent to Union vessels (Arnold
1982:29; Perry 1965:46).
The Union established a naval blockade along the Texas coast early in the war, but
the Matagorda Bay area was a center for blockade-running activities and several blockaders
were captured in the vicinity. On April 21, 1863, the U.S.S. Rachel Seaman captured the
schooner Nymph attempting to run the blockade into Pass Cavallo with a cargo of coffee,
rice, shoes, and medicine. The sloop Blazer, captured at Pass Cavallo by the U.S.S. Brooklyn
on May 27, was outward-bound with a cargo of cotton. On June 23, the British blockaderunner Sea Drift, with a cargo of gunpowder, lead, and drugs, was taken near Matagorda
Island by the U.S.S. Itasca. Another British blockade-runner, the schooner Florrie, was
seized with a cargo of medicine, wine, and saddles, on October 1 near Matagorda by the
U.S.S. Bermuda. The schooner Reserve was captured off Pass Cavallo on October 25 by the
U.S.S. Kittatinny (Naval History Division 1971:3:70, 87, 97, 143, 149).
In November 1863, Union forces under General Nathaniel Banks, moving up the
coast from the Corpus Christi area, arrived at Matagorda Island and attacked Fort Esperanza
(Long 1971:436). The Confederate forces once again abandoned the fort, this time blowing
up the magazines and burning Saluria, which was never rebuilt (Arnold 1982:29; Naval
History Division 1971:3:159; Webb 1952:2:537). In April 1864, the U.S.S. Estrella and two
U.S. Army steamers, the Zephyr and the Warrior, made a reconnaissance expedition up
Matagorda Bay, sighting and firing upon two Confederate vessels near Matagorda Reef;
however, the quarry escaped. The Union ships landed troops on the upper bay, captured two
small schooners, and returned to Pass Cavallo (Naval History Division 1971:4:42).
On November 30, 1864, a British blockade-runner, the schooner Carrie Mair, was
captured off Pass Cavallo by the U.S.S. Itasca. A few days later, on December 8, the Itasca
made another capture, the sloop Mary Ann. Union personnel removed the cargo of cotton
from the sloop and destroyed her (Naval History Division 1971:4:116). On February 18,
1865, a boat crew from the U.S.S. Pinola boarded the schooner Anna Dale, which had been
armed and fitted out at Pass Cavallo as a cruiser by the Confederates. The prize crew
accidentally grounded her and set her afire to prevent recapture (Naval History Division
1971:5:45).

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

The Union's blockade of the Texas coast restricted foreign cotton trade, crippled the
commerce of the port at Matagorda, and severely damaged the local economy. It took many
years for the region to recover from the effects of the Civil War. Many planters left the
region; however, cattle ranching grew in prominence. Beef packing plants and a hide and
tallow factory were established near the coast prior to 1870. Cotton production did revive
after 1870, but the port of Matagorda was no longer a commercially viable port, losing its
trade to the towns of Port Lavaca and Indianola on the western side of Matagorda Bay. The
1890s saw some revival in the countyâs agricultural economy. The inland community of Bay
City was founded in 1894 and it replaced Matagorda as the county seat. In 1902, the town of
Palacios on Tres Palacios Bay was founded and became a shrimping and oystering center.
After 1899, rice became an important agricultural product and rice plantations sprang up
along the railroad line running north of Bay City. By 1920, 38,000 acres in the county were
planted in rice, and more than 46,000 acres were planted in cotton. Additionally, tenants
became increasingly numerous, and by 1930 about 60 percent of the farms in the county
were operated by tenant farmers (Kleiner 2009a).
.
Massive log jams had blocked the lower Colorado River since the early years of
Anglo settlement and impeded travel on the river. However, in the late 1920s, efforts to
remove the log jams on the lower Colorado were finally successful. But, by this time
railroads had extended throughout the county, and the importance of the Colorado River and
nearby Caney Creek as routes of transportation had been negated. In 1901, oil and gas were
discovered at Big Hill, and within a few years several oil fields were in production. Shortly
afterwards, sulphur began to be mined. Cotton cultivation continued to decline through the
first several decades of the twentieth century, as the oil, gas, and sulphur industries expanded
and these have continued to be important to the present day. The fishing industry, which
began in the final decade of the nineteenth century, became important by the 1930s,
particularly with improvements in gear used for catching shrimp. Matagorda Bay developed
into an important shrimping and oystering local and it remains so today (Kleiner 2009a).
The Town of Matagorda
The first Anglo settlers to the Austin Colony arrived aboard the schooner Only Son in
1822. In 1827, Stephen Austin received permission to build a town at the mouth of the
Colorado River to protect incoming settlers. The result was the town of Matagorda, the
earliest settlement on Matagorda Bay (see Figure 3-2). Elias R. Wightman, Hosea H.
League, James E. B. Austin, and partners Thomas M. Duke and William Selkirk each took a
one-quarter interest in the townsite. Elias Wightman, after laying out the town in 1827,
gathered approximately 50 to 60 colonists, mostly from New York, for the community
(Kleiner 2009b). From the beginning, cotton was an important crop for the settlers and a gin
was in operation in the area as early as 1825. Matagorda was incorporated in 1830 and
became an official Mexican Port of Entry in 1831. By 1832, the town had some 1,400
residents (Hansen 1969:571; Webb 1952:2:157).
Matagorda was an important and commercially active town during the Mexican
period and under the Republic of Texas. Beginning in the 1830s, the town, then the closest
Texas port city to New Orleans, served as an entry point for immigrants arriving both
overland and by sea. Ships sailed to the town from New Orleans with supplies for the Texas
colony. Citizens from Matagorda were involved in meetings leading to the Texas Revolution

21

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

(1835-1836), and several were among those who signed the Goliad Declaration of
Independence in 1835. The town was deserted during the âRunaway Scrape,â when many
Texans fled their homes as Mexican General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna began his
attempted conquest of Texas in February 1836 (Kleiner 2009b). Subsequent to the defeat of
Santa Annaâs army at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, the Republic of Texas was
founded.
After the Revolution and during the period of the Republic of Texas (1836-1845),
Matagorda grew in importance as a shipping point. In 1836, Matagorda was established as a
port of entry by the new Republic of Texas. George W. Collinsworth was appointed the first
Collector of customs for the District of Matagorda (Matagorda County Historical
Commission 1986:122). The Collector was responsible for collecting tariffs on imported and
exported goods, and on warehouse and dock rentals, harbor entrance fees and clearance fees.
In 1840, a customhouse was finally built in Matagorda (Matagorda County Historical
Commission 1986:121, 124). The importance of Matagorda is expressed in President Martin
Van Burenâs nomination of Senator John Monges of Delaware to serve as United States
consul in Matagorda in 1838. In December 1845, the U. S. Congress established the entirety
of the new state of Texas as a single custom collection district with Galveston as the port of
entry. Matagorda and several other small ports were named âports of delivery.â In January
1846, President James K. Polk nominated Galen Hodges as the first United States âSurveyor
and Inspectorâ of customs at Matagorda. In June 1846, citizens of Matagorda petitioned
Congress to establish a new collection district with Matagorda as the port of entry. In 1847,
Congress did divide Texas into two collection districts, but the town of Saluria was named
the port of entry for the Southern District, into which the town of Matagorda fell. James H.
Selkirk constructed one of the first dock and warehouse businesses in the town, and by 1840,
wagon freight service was available on a more or less regularly scheduled basis between
Matagorda and Austin (Hogan 1946:67). Matagorda was the site of a district court under the
Republic of Texas and served as county seat from 1837 to 1894 (Hogan 1946:258). A large
sugar mill, a grist mill, and a beef packing plant were located there before the Civil War, and
a hide and tallow factory by 1870.
Although Matagorda was the earliest of the towns founded on Matagorda Bay and a
critical port during the earliest period of settlement, it was somewhat inaccessible for ships.
Vessels sailing to the port had to enter Matagorda Bay through Pass Cavallo, located over 20
miles to the west, and then they had to travel across the shallow bay along the north side of
Matagorda Peninsula to reach the town at the mouth of the Colorado River (see Figure 3-2).
This route passed by several shoals and reefs, including Halfmoon Reef, Shell Island Reef,
and, most particularly, Dog Island Reef, all of which represented hazards to navigation.
Reports and maps from the nineteenth century indicate that water depths leading to the town
were only 3 to 4 ft (Figure 3-3). This meant that only very shallow draft vessels could reach
the town, or goods had to be lightered from vessels anchored in the bay in deeper water.
William Bollaert, writing in 1842, described the difficulties in reaching the customhouse in
Matagorda:
Got under way and in making for the custom house to present the shipâs
papers, got aground. What the reason can be I do not know why a custom
house should be placed where it is, so much out of the way and moreover
dangerous to get at. The proper position would be at Decrows Point where

22

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

there is deep water for anchorage and every facility of getting to it, and in a
direct course to the town of Matagorda [in Matagorda County Historical
Commission 1986:122].

Figure 3-3. Detail of an 1846 map of Matagorda Bay showing the water depths along the sailing
route to the town of Matagorda (Scarritt and Meade 1846).

The most common types of vessels serving Matagorda during the first half of the
nineteenth century were shallow-draft sloops, schooners, and steamboats. In most instances,
we know very little about these vessels other than their names. Among the ships sailing to
Matagorda during the early years of the Austin Colony were the schooners Only Son, Lively,
and John Motley. In 1822, while sailing from New Orleans to the mouth of the Colorado
River, the Lively was lost off the west end of Galveston Island (Matagorda County Historical
Commission 1986:28). Later, in the 1830s, schooners such as the Marmion and Martha are
mentioned. In March 1838, the schooner Pocomoke arrived at Matagorda from New Orleans
with families intending to settle in Texas. In 1841, the schooner Black Jack was issued a
license at Matagorda. In 1837, two steamers operated regularly on Matagorda Bay. These
were the Amite and the Convoy (Matagorda County Historical Commission 1986:121-124).
Many of the vessels traveling to Texas in the first half of the nineteenth century were
issued register or enrollment documents in New Orleans and, fortunately, these records are
extant and provide some descriptive information on these early Texas vessels. The John
Motley, which was sailing to Texas in the 1820s, was a small 52-ft-long, two-masted
schooner built at Blakely, Alabama, in 1821. In June 1822, the John Motley was issued a

23

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

register at New Orleans, a document required for vessels sailing to foreign ports, which
Texas was at the time. The John Motley had a depth of hull of only 3 ft, 9 inches, probably
shallow enough to travel the route across Matagorda Bay to the mouth of the Colorado River
(Work Projects Administration [WPA] 1942:2:86). The Martha was a 69-ft, two-masted
schooner built at Waterville, Maine, in 1829. The Martha obviously traded with Texas
because a register issued to the schooner at New Orleans in August 1834 contains a notation
that the vessel âwrecked at Port of Matagorda, Feb. 11, 1837, and sold.â Exactly where this
loss occurred is unknown, but it appears to have been at or near the town in eastern
Matagorda Bay. The Martha was apparently raised and repaired after the wreck, because the
schooner was issued another register document in New Orleans in April 1837 (WPA
1942:3:136). The Pocomoke was a two-masted, 77 ft, 6 inch-long schooner built in
Worcester County, Maryland, in 1837. This schooner was issued a temporary register in
New Orleans on March 12, 1838, apparently specifically to permit the ship to sail to Texas,
still a foreign country, with its group of settlers. With a depth of hull of 6 ft, 6 in, the
Pocomoke would have had a difficult time reaching Matagorda and may have had to unload
in deeper water out in Matagorda Bay (WPA 1942:3:176). The schooner Black Jack, which
was issued a license at Matagorda in 1841, is believed to be the small, 32 ft, 7 inch-long
schooner built in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1837. This tiny schooner was sailing on the Gulf
coast, probably to Texas, in 1838, the year she was issued a register in New Orleans.
Sometime after this, the Black Jack seems to have shifted her homeport to Matagorda. With
a depth of hull of only 3 ft, the Black Jack was ideally suited to sail the shallow waters of
Matagorda Bay and surrounding waters (WPA 1942:3:25).
In 1837, the steamboat Amite was owned by Daniel G. Conner of Texas who obtained
a register for the vessel at Matagorda from George Collinsworth, the Collector of Customs at
the port. The Amite measured 68 ft long and 4 ft deep and was built in Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania, in 1836 (Matagorda County Historical Commission 1986:123). The Amiteâs
shallow draft was ideally suited for the Texas coastal bays. The steamer Convoy, built in
Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1837, was a much larger vessel, measuring almost 161 ft long and 8 ft, 6
inches deep (WPA 1942:3:49). With such a deep hull, it is unlikely that the Convoy could
actually reach the town of Matagorda or the mouth of the Colorado River. Another early
steamboat associated with Matagorda was the Delta. The Delta was a small 78 ft-long, 3 ft,
6 inch-deep steamboat built in Batesville, Arkansas. In 1847, the Delta was enrolled at
Matagorda and her owner and master was Thomas Decrau, a resident of the town (WPA
1942:4:71).
In addition to the problems involved in reaching the town of Matagorda, vessels
traveling on the Colorado River itself were also hampered. Transport on the river was
impeded by log rafts and jams produced by the riverâs slow moving current. By 1836, the
log rafts and jams that had blocked the river mouth had been cleared to permit access to the
town. But, log jams gradually grew upstream so that in 1839 river was navigable only ten
miles or so above its mouth. By 1858, the blockage had become so bad that state funds were
appropriated for the construction of a new channel around the raft. Despite these and other
efforts to clear the raft, it was never entirely removed during the nineteenth century, even
though shallow-draught vessels were at times able to ascend the Colorado to Austin. More
commonly, to get around the raft, teamsters unloaded vessels above the raft and carried the
cargo down to other teams that loaded it on other boats for shipment to Galveston and other
Gulf ports (Comer and Kleiner 2009). The Colorado River ceased to be an important factor

24

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

in transportation shortly after the Civil War, as other towns established around the bay were
more accessible by sea-going vessels. As a result, the commercial importance of Matagorda
declined as others rose (Webb 1952:2:157-158).
During the Civil War, Matagorda was one of several Texas ports used by blockade
runners to transport cotton out of the state, and bring needed materiel and supplies in. The
Union navy blockaded this portion of the Gulf by 1862, interrupting this surreptitious trade.
The town was fired upon by Union forces, but never occupied. After the war, agriculture in
the region declined, bringing an end to the plantation economy and Matagorda continued to
decline. However, ranching grew and the expanding beef industry led to the establishment of
the Stabler Patent Beef Packing Plant in 1866 and a hide and tallow factory in 1870.
Matagorda was periodically damaged by hurricanes, including those in 1875, 1886, and
1894. These storms, in conjunction with the decreased importance of Matagorda as a
commercial center, were partly responsible for shifting the county seat to Bay City in 1894
(Kleiner 2009b).
The removal of the logjam on the Colorado River in the 1920s, led to the
development of a delta that reached across Matagorda Bay as far as Matagorda Peninsula by
1936. That year a channel was dredged through the new delta from the Gulf of Mexico to the
town of Matagorda, thus forcing the river to deposit its sediment directly into the Gulf. With
removal of the raft, the community of Matagorda, formerly a major Texas port, gradually
became landlocked (Comer and Kleiner 2009).
The Cane Belt Railroad reached the town around 1901 and the community was on the
Gulf Intracoastal Waterway by 1914. In the late nineteenth century, oystering in Matagorda
Bay began to develop into an important enterprise. The first oyster âclaimâ in Matagorda
Bay was made in the late nineteenth century by Billie Sterling and Charlie Baker and the first
fish and oyster house in Matagorda was established in the 1880s by a Mr. Lorina. Oystering
as an important commercial enterprise in Matagorda began with the arrival of the railroad
and by 1911 the firm of Lorina and Thornhill marketed 25,000 barrels of oysters, and
242,300 pounds of fish (Marr 1928:228-230). Beginning in the 1920s, oil wells and the local
operations of the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company provided employment and drew new
residents to the area. In 1942, a hurricane caused major damage and prompted the
construction of a protective levee around the town; lessening the effects of later hurricanes.
After World War II Matagorda became a tourist and resort community and these have
remained important to the present (Kleiner 2009b).

Other Towns Around Matagorda Bay
A series of other communities sprang up around Matagorda Bay during the nineteenth
century. These included Linnville and Lavaca (present Port Lavaca), located on Lavaca Bay,
and Indianola, located on the western shore of Matagorda Bay. By the 1850s, Port Lavaca
and, especially, Indianola, were becoming the important ports on Matagorda Bay, ultimately
replacing the town of Matagorda in terms of commercial activity. These towns are some
distance from the Halfmoon Reef project area and are not discussed here. Discussions on
their histories can be found in Pearson et al. 1993 and Malsh 1988.
Figure 3-2, presented above, is a detail of an 1846 map of Matagorda Bay showing
the principal towns on the bay at the time, in addition to several communities that were
planned, but never fully developed, including two on Palacios Point in the vicinity of
Halfmoon Reef. The towns of Linnville (âLinvillâ on the map shown as Figure 3-2) and Port
Lavaca, both established before 1840, are located on the western shore of Lavaca Bay, and
Matagorda, the oldest community on the bay is shown at the mouth of the Colorado River.
Two communities are shown on Palacios Point, near Halfmoon Reef. These are Austin and
Palacios, both of which were planned, but neither of which ever amounted to much. Austin
appears to have never been truly established, although in later years a hotel was constructed
at the location, leading to the present name for this location, Hotel Point. Palacios or
Palacios Point, as it was commonly called, was founded in 1838 by John Duncan and R. R.
Royall. That year, the two men placed an advertisement in the Matagorda Bulletin, stating:
This town is situated upon âHalf Moon Point,â formed by the junctions of the
Bays of Matagorda and Trespalaciosâthe latter of which forms a harbour of
superior excellence, affording a sufficient depth of water contiguous to the
shore for the largest vessels which can enter the Matagorda Bay to lay in
security alongside of a wharf and discharge and receive cargoes at pleasure. .
. . The proprietors with a thorough knowledge of the whole sea coast,
unhesitatingly state it as their firm conviction that this place will become the
great commercial emporium of Texas [in Griffin 1986:390].
Palacios Point did not live up to the promises of the developers, although a townsite
was laid out, a few lots sold, and a few houses built. Apparently, a wharf was constructed,
because cattle were occasionally shipped from the town aboard Morgan Line steamers.
Ultimately, a conflict arose over the title to the land, and it failed to develop. The hurricane
of 1875 forced abandonment of the townsite and shortly after the remaining houses were torn
down (Griffin 1986:390).
The Town of Palacios
The town of Palacios was established on Tres Palacios Bay in 1902 by the Palacios
City Townsite Company, a subsidiary of the Texas Rice Development Company, the owners
of the land. Lots for the town were surveyed that year by J. F. Hervey. By 1903, the
Southern Pacific Railroad extended its line to Palacios and a hotel was built. This was
shortly followed by construction of a large T-head pier and pavilion extending into the bay
(Matagorda County Historical Commission 1986:367).

26

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

The town developed into a tourist community and, also, a fishing and oystering
center. In 1903, the first packing company was opened. By 1915, the town had 2,000
residents and numerous businesses, including two banks, newspaper, mercantile and
groceries, a telephone company, machine shops, a livery and transfer, dairy, tailor drug
stores, restaurants, feed store, broom factory, and planning mill.
The oyster business became the most important in the town. By 1915, there was a
fleet of about 30 oyster boats operating out of Palacios, collecting oysters from the numerous
reefs in Matagorda Bay, of which Halfmoon Reef was one of the most important (Figure 34). Several docks and oyster processing facilities were built on the bay on the south side of
town. The town was damaged by several hurricanes over the years. In 1915, a hurricane
washed away fish and oyster wharves and the dock and pavilion.

Figure 3-4. Oyster houses and boats at Palacios circa 1913. The small, single-masted sailing vessels
were the type involved in oystering and fishing on and around Halfmoon Reef in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Matagorda County Historical Commission
1986:371).

The early vessels involved in oystering were sailing sloops and luggers, with oysters
collected by tonging. Fish were caught with seines. Marr (1928:232) presents a list of 21
fishing boats operating out of Palacios in 1912, with names like Fannie, Zargosa, Motor Go
and Eagle. These included sailing, as well as motorized vessels. Most of these boats were
involved in oystering; only a few worked in fishing. By the late 1920s, Palacios was the
principal oyster port in Texas, shipping around 25,000 barrels of oysters annually, as well as
100,000 pounds of fish (Marr 1928:233). The shrimping industry in Matagorda Bay did not
begin until about 1920, with the arrival of Fred Bates, Sr. from Mississippi, who seems to
have initiated the business (Ted Bates, Jr., personal communication 2009). As oystering
declined, shrimping became the most important fishing activity in Palacios. In the 1920s,
most of the sailboats working in the bay were converted to motor power and by 1935 all of
the fishing boats working out of Palacios were motor boats. By 1938, the Crawford Cannery

27

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

in Palacios was processing from 40,000 to 60,000 pounds of shrimp a day, and on some days
up to 100,000 pounds. Shrimp were initially sold fresh or salted for shipment, but by the
1940s they were being frozen for market. Crabbing as an industry did not begin until after
World War II.
In the 1950s, larger shrimp boats began to be built to catch brown shrimp in the open
waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Ultimately two types of shrimp trawlers were developed in the
region; small âBay boatsâ that worked in the shallow-water bays and larger âGulf boatsâ that
worked offshore and often remained at sea for several days at a time. In the mid-1970s,
several Vietnamese families settled in Palacios and became involved in the shrimping
business. By the 1990s, Vietnamese families operated five fish houses in Palacios and
owned or operated 60 Gulf boats and 45 Bay boats working out of the town (Palacios
Museum 2009). In 1990, the marine and seafood-processing industry was the largest
industry in the Palacios area. Several seafood-processing plants shipped fresh and frozen
shrimp and crabmeat nationwide. Among these facilities is the largest blue-crab-processing
plant in the United States. Agriculture, livestock raising, and petroleum and natural gas are
also a vital part of the Palacios area economy, and in 1990 aquaculture was the newest
developing industry there (Cox 1986:430-432; Griffin 2009).
Shipwrecks Recorded in the Vicinity of the Project Area
The historical record indicates a modest level of shipping activity in the vicinity of
Halfmoon Reef since the nineteenth century, specifically in relation to the towns of
Matagorda and, later, Palacios. However, specific accounts of shipwrecks in the area are
rare. Although a number of shipwrecks have been reported in Matagorda Bay as a whole,
very few have been physically located and identified as such. Pearson and Hudson
(1990:17), for example, provide a list of 27 named and ten unknown vessels lost in the
vicinity of the Matagorda Ship Channel, several miles west of Halfmoon Reef. Many of
these named losses occurred at or near Indianola and the remains of several historic vessels
have been reported at the old port town. In addition, various historical accounts report a
large number of sinkings in Matagorda Bay, but losses of most of these vessels is imprecisely
reported such that their exact location is unknown. For example, an early incident in
Matagorda Bay that is not well documented is the 1817 loss of a small fleet of possibly
Spanish vessels at the hands of Galveston pirates (Arnold 1982:24; Scurlock 1971:4). Also,
many boats were destroyed in the great hurricane that struck Matagorda Bay on September
16, 1875, although where most of the vessels actually sank is unknown. Losses also
occurred in the storm of 1886, including the fishing boat Buffalo Bill and the schooner
Flower of France (Scurlock 1971:4), but not on the same scale as the 1875 hurricane.
Texas archaeological site data provided online on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Texas Historical Commission 2009) lists several shipwrecks in the vicinity of Halfmoon
Reef, but only one of these is identified. This is the seventeenth century wreck of the French
vessel La Belle. In 1995, the wreck of La Belle, assigned site number 41MG86, was
discovered in the shallow waters of southern Matagorda Bay, about 7.1 km southwest of
Halfmoon Reef. In 1996 and 1997, the Texas Historical Commission undertook excavation
of the wreck site. As noted previously, the wreck of La Belle represents possibly the most
important shipwreck ever discovered in the United States (Bruseth and Turner 2005; Weddle
2001).

28

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

The other shipwrecks identified on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas near
Halfmoon Reef all appear to be derived from United States Coast and Geodetic Survey
(USCGS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) navigation charts.
None of these wrecks lie on or immediately adjacent to Halfmoon Reef, or within the project
area, but they are in the vicinity. These include the following:
1. THC Shipwreck No. 1236: an unidentified wreck located about 4.5 km (2.89
miles) north of Halfmoon Reef.
2. THC Shipwreck No. 935: an unidentified wreck located about 5 km west of the
southwestern tip of Halfmoon Reef
3. THC Shipwreck No. 936: an unidentified wreck located adjacent to Shipwreck
No. 935.
4. THC Shipwreck Nos. 879 and 934: two unidentified wrecks located about 4.3 km
south of Halfmoon Reef and south of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.
5. THC Shipwreck No. 1486: an unidentified wreck located about 10.5 km south of
Halfmoon Reef on the north side of Matagorda Peninsula.
The reported shipwreck closest to Halfmoon Reef is depicted on recent editions of
NOAA navigation chart No. 11317 entitled Matagorda Bay. This wreck is not listed in the
THC files and the evidence examined in this study suggests it is a recent wreck. An
examination of editions of the Matagorda Bay chart dating back to the 1930s reveals that this
wreck is first shown on the 1998 edition of Chart No. 11317, and it appears on editions up
through 2009. The wreck is situated due south of Palacios Point and only about 1 km east of
Halfmoon Reef, at the following geographic coordinates: Latitude = 28 degrees 33â 47â
North; Longitude= 96 degrees 13â, 12â West. This location falls well outside of the present
project area. These NOAA charts, also, show that a warning light was placed at the wreck
site, suggesting it was considered a hazard to navigation. NOAAâs Automated Wreck and
Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) was queried to see if that system included a
record for this wreck. It turns out that this wreck is listed as AWOIS Record No. 8727 and is
identified as an unknown vessel with an unknown date of loss. The âHistoryâ section of the
AWOIS record notes that the wreck was first reported in 1991-1992, suggesting it was lost
about that time. In June 1993, the United States Coast Guard contacted the Corps of
Engineers about removal of the wreck and reported that a temporary buoy would be retained
on the site until the removal of the wreck was confirmed. All of the available information
indicates that this wreck is recent and not historically significant. Further, as noted, the
wreck falls outside of the present project area.

The Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse
Although no historic shipwrecks are reported to exist on Halfmoon Reef, one
structure of historical importance did stand on the reef from 1858 to 1943. This was the
Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse (or the âHalf Moon Reef Light Houseâ or âHalf Moon Reef Light
Station,â as it was often referred to in the nineteenth century) that was situated near the
southwestern end of the reef (Figure 3-5). T. L. Baker (1991) provides a fairly detailed
history of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse and his information has been supplemented with
additional primary documents examined in the National Archives and other secondary
sources in the following discussions.

Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse

Survey navigation chart entitled Matagorda Bay

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

In 1852, a lighthouse was erected at Pass Cavallo to help guide ships into Matagorda
Bay and, specifically, to the then growing port town of Indianola. Subsequently, requests
were made by the citizens of Indianola for additional lights to mark channels and obstacles in
the bay itself. Complying with these demands, the Lighthouse Board successfully petitioned
Congress in 1854 for funds to construct a light on the southern tip of Halfmoon Reef. On
August 3, 1854, the United States Congress authorized $10,000 for the construction of this
lighthouse (T. L. Baker 1991:34). The lighthouse was considered important for navigation in
Matagorda Bay, particularly for ships sailing to and from the port town of Matagorda at the
mouth of the Colorado River. However, the need for the lighthouse may have been
exaggerated because by this time Matagorda was declining in importance as a commercial
port, being replaced by other towns around Matagorda Bay, particularly Indianola and
Lavaca. Both of these towns are located on the western side of Matagorda Bay, where
Halfmoon Reef was of little threat to navigation.
The Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse was one of the early lighthouses in Texas. The first
two lighthouses erected by the United States government in the state were at Bolivar Point,
marking the entrance to Galveston Bay; and at Pass Cavallo, lighting the entrance to
Matagorda Bay. Both of these structures were built in 1852. Several more Texas
lighthouses were added between 1852 and 1858, when the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse was
completed (T. L. Baker 1991). Those lighthouses built after 1852 were erected under the
authority of the United States Lighthouse Board, the federal agency responsible for the
construction and operation of lighthouses in the United States. The Lighthouse Board was
created in 1852 to oversee the Lighthouse Service because of numerous complaints against
the Fifth Auditor of the Treasury Department that had formerly been in charge of
lighthouses. The Lighthouse Board membership was composed of experienced and
knowledgeable naval officers. The country was organized into 12 lighthouse districts, each
having an Inspector (a naval officer) who was charged with building lighthouses and seeing
that they remained in good condition and that the lens was in operation. The Gulf coast from
Barataria Bay, Louisiana, to the Mexican border comprised the Ninth District, which
included all of Texas. Galveston was the headquarters of the Ninth District. After a few
years, the inspectors became overburdened with work and an engineer (an army officer) was
appointed to each district to tend to the construction and maintenance of lighthouses. After
its formation in 1852, the Lighthouse Board moved quickly in applying new technology,
particularly in purchasing and installing new Fresnel lenses and constructing screw-pile
lighthouses, such as the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse.
Plans for the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse were not completed until several years after
Congress authorized the $10,000 for its construction. Records at the National Archives in
Washington, D.C. include the original 1856-1857 engineering drawings produced for the
lighthouse, as well as later drawings made in 1911 when major repairs were made to the
station. These various drawings provide detailed information on its construction.
Unfortunately, relatively few textual documents relating to the original planning and
construction of the lighthouse have been found in the National Archives. Some may simply
be filed in obscure and difficult to find locations, but others are known to have been
destroyed in a fire in the 1920s. Among these destroyed documents were the letter books
containing correspondence related to the construction of the lighthouse, although an index
file (Index Slips) to this correspondence does exist in Record Group 26 at the National

31

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

Archives. The entries in this index typically provide the name of the writer, the date of the
correspondence, and a very brief description of the contents. Although meager, these records
provide some clues on the events related to the erection of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse.
On November 25, 1854, Lieutenant Walter H. Stevens wrote a letter or report that
discussed the siting of a lighthouse on Halfmoon Reef in Matagorda Bay (Stevens 1854).
This was just a few months after Congress authorized the funds for building a lighthouse at
Halfmoon Reef. Lieutenant Stevensâ letter was destroyed in the 1920s fire, but record of it
exists in the surviving index of correspondence and it appears to be one of the earliest
documents relating to the planning of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. Walter Husted
Stevens was an officer in the Corps of Engineers and he was assigned as the âInspectorâ for
the Ninth Lighthouse District in charge of the construction and maintenance of lighthouses
(Figure 3-6). Lieutenant Stevens, a native of New York, graduated from West Point in 1848
and was commissioned a Lieutenant of Engineers and assigned to New Orleans. While there,
he was involved in the construction of the fort on the island of Grand Terre and fortifications
at Lake Borgne. He also designed the defenses for the Mississippi River and the city of New
Orleans. In 1853, Stevens became a member of the Board of Engineers assigned to survey
rivers and harbors along the western Gulf and to select sites for fortifications in Texas. In

1854, he was appointed as the âLight House Inspectorâ for the Ninth Lighthouse District (N.
B. Stevens 1896:39-41). In this capacity, Walter Stevens built several lighthouses along the
coast, including the Ship Shoal Lighthouse off the central Louisiana coast, as well as the
Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse in Texas. At the start of the Civil War, Walter Stevens resigned
his commission and offered his services to the Confederacy. Stevensâ wife, Valerie Hebert,
was a member of a distinguished Louisiana family and this appears to be a principal reason
for his throwing his lot with the Confederacy. Walter Stevens had a distinguished career as a
Confederate officer, rising to the rank of Brigadier General and serving as Chief Engineer of
the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee (Figure 3-6). In this position he
was responsible for designing and constructing the defenses of Richmond. Following the
war, Walter Stevens took a position as an engineer for a railroad company in Vera Cruz,
Mexico. While in Vera Cruz, he contracted yellow fever and died there on November 12,
1867. His body was returned to Richmond, Virginia, where he was buried with great
ceremony (N. B. Stevens 1896:40-42).
In 1856 and 1857, Lieutenant Stevens and others wrote several letters and reports
concerning the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. On February 16, 1856, Stevens wrote that
operations were commencing at âHalf Moon Shoal, Matagorda Bay, Texâ (W. H. Stevens
1856). This letter seems to relate to preliminary selection of the location of the lighthouse,
because later correspondence in August and October 1856 discuss the specific examination
of the location of the lighthouse and aspects of foundation conditions. In August 1856,
Lieutenant Stevens recommended that the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse, as well as another
lighthouse in Matagorda Bay abreast of Alligator Head, be built as screw-pile structures, a
design then beginning to appear in Chesapeake Bay (T. L. Baker 1991:35). In January 1857,
Stevens wrote specifically about the placement of these two âScrewpile Lt. Houses.â
Apparently, by this time, the design of the lighthouse had been decided upon, and by March
1857, Lieutenant Stevens was writing about engineering aspects of the lighthouse (W. H.
Stevens 1857).
It is unknown how Walter Stevens participated in the development of drawings and
plans for the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. He certainly recommended the design of the
lighthouse, but it is possible that the plans were produced by engineers of the Lighthouse
Board or by the firm constructing the ironwork for the lighthouse. Ultimately, these plans
were examined and approved by Lieutenant Stevens. On May 26, 1857, the I. P. Morris &
Company of Philadelphia transmitted drawings for the âHalf Moon Shoal, Texasâ lighthouse
to the Ninth District. Two weeks earlier, this same firm had submitted a âProposal for iron
workâ for the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. Several months later, on September 14, 1857,
Hayward, Bartlett & Company of Baltimore also submitted a proposal for providing the âiron
workâ for the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. Hayward, Bartlett & Company, ultimately, was
selected to provide the ironwork for the lighthouse (T. L. Baker 1991:35-36; Hayward,
Bartlett & Company 1857; I. P. Morris & Company 1857). This firm was a major
manufacturer of iron machinery and foundry pieces that had been founded by Jonas H.
Hayward, with his elder brother George, in about 1837. In 1839, George Hayward left the
firm and another brother, Nehemiah Hayward, joined Jonas in the company. Through the
1840s, the name of the company was listed variously as Hayward & Company; Hayward,
Fox & Company; and Bartlett, Robbins & Company. David L. Bartlett became associated
with the firm as a partner in 1844, after which the name was changed to Hayward, Bartlett &
Company. The firm erected a large foundry on Leadenhall Street in Baltimore, and in 1851 a

33

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

new and larger facility consisting of foundry and machine shops, was erected at Pratt and
Scott streets. The company was principally involved in the manufacture of ornamental and
architectural iron work, galvanized iron work, boilers, various forms of heating apparatus,
and later, with building locomotives. The company, apparently, produced iron work for
several lighthouses; in 1856, they manufactured the lantern for the Aransas Pass Lighthouse
at Aransas Pass, Texas. Jonas Hayward was particularly identified with improved methods
for heating large buildings (T. L. Baker 1991:24; Lewis Historical Publishing Company
1912:48-49).
In September 1857, Captain William B. Franklin, of the Topographic Engineers,
dispersed $3,686.00 to Lieutenant Walter Stevens for âLt. House on or near Half Moon Reef
Texasâ (Franklin 1857). It is suspected that this money was to be used by Walter Stevens for
the construction of the lighthouse and, possibly, for the purchase of the iron work from
Hayward, Bartlett & Company and other material. Captain Franklin was the Supervisor of
the Lighthouse Board, having been appointed to that position in March 1857. He was
responsible for lighthouse construction across the nation.
Material for the lighthouse was shipped to the site in Matagorda Bay during the
winter of 1857-1858. The iron screw piles for the lighthouse were shipped from Baltimore in
December 1857. These went, first, to Galveston and then were carried to Matagorda Bay in
March 1858 aboard the schooner Harriet. It is suspected that other ironwork in addition to
the screw piles was aboard the Harriet. âGlassâ for the lighthouse was shipped in January
1858, and the Fresnel lens was ordered from the Staten Island lighthouse depot in March
1858 and shipped aboard the bark Golden Age. In February 1858, Captain William Franklin
sent Lieutenant Stevens the plans for the wooden superstructure of the lighthouse that would
rest on top of the iron screw piles. These plans copied the design of the lighthouse then in
service at Wades Point, North Carolina (T. L. Baker 1991:35-36).
With the arrival of the ironwork in March 1858, Walter Stevens proceeded with
construction of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. As noted previously, the original plans of
the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse are extant at the National Archives. These drawings, in
addition to the existing wooden superstructure now standing in the town of Port Lavaca, and
several historic photographs provide comprehensive information on the construction and
appearance of the lighthouse. None of the extant drawings in the National Archives contain
the name of the agency that produced them; however several of the sheets do include the
name âJ. K. Whilldin.â This was Joseph K. Whilldin, a civil and mechanical engineer who
was attached to the Lighthouse Board in Washington D.C. in the 1850s and 1860s (Journal of
the Franklin Institute 1866). It is unknown if Whilldin was involved in the design of the
lighthouse, or if he was simply responsible for drafting the final plans.
The Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse was an iron screw-pile (sometimes âscrewpileâ)
lighthouse, a type of structure that came into common use throughout the United States in the
nineteenth century. These types of structures were designed specifically for sandy areas,
where soft or shifting soil conditions prevented the construction of masonry lighthouses.
Many screw-pile lighthouses were erected in shallow-water locations with sandy or mud
bottoms, the conditions existing at Halfmoon Reef. These lighthouses employed iron pilings,
known as âscrew piles,â for their foundations. The screw pile usually consisted of a rollediron shaft, 3 to 10 inches in diameter, having at its foot one or two turns of a cast-iron screw,

34

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

the blades of which varied from 1 to 5 ft in diameter. The piles ordinarily employed for
lighthouses exposed to moderate seas had a shaft 3 to 5 inches in diameter and screw blades
3 to 4 ft in diameter. The cast iron screw weighed 600 to 700 pounds (I. O. Baker 1905:733).
Typically, for small lighthouse built in shallow water, such as the Halfmoon Reef
Lighthouse, these iron pilings were screwed 10 to 15 ft into the ground and extended several
feet above the water level, where they were connected and topped with iron framing. The
lighthouse structures were typically wooden buildings that sat on top of the iron pilings and
framing. The screw piles, with their wide-bladed screw at the bottom, had an advantage over
ordinary straight pilings in that they could not be drawn upward by the force of any wave
action against the superstructure. The supporting power of screw piles, also, was
considerable, owing to the increased bearing surface of the flaring screw blade (I. O. Baker
1905:733).
The original plans of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse reveal that the foundation
consisted of six iron screw pilings arranged in a hexagonal pattern around a seventh, central
piling (Figures 3-7 and 3-8). The hexagon measured approximately 15 ft on a side. Each of
these round pilings was 24 ft long and six inches in diameter. A cast iron screw tip
measuring 2 ft in diameter was fitted at the bottom of each screw pile (Figure 3-9). The
pilings were screwed into the reef a distance of 9 ft and they extended above the bottom a
distance of 15 ft (Figure 3-7). Iron braces and framing connected the pilings at the bay
bottom and at their tops. In addition, a framework of 2-in-diameter cast iron rods fitted with
turnbuckles connected the pilings, as shown in Figure 3-7. Cast iron hubs were fitted on the
central screw pile and iron and wooden braces and framing extended from the hubs to the
pilings on the outside edge of the hexagon. This framing formed the foundation for the
wooden lighthouse building.
The initial task in erecting the lighthouse was screwing the pilings nine feet into the
reef. No specific description on how this was done at the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse has
survived, but Ira Baker (1905:734) reports that:
These piles are usually screwed into the soil by men working with capstan
bars. Sometimes a rope is wound around the shaft and the two ends pulled in
opposite directions by two capstans, and sometimes the screw is turned by
attaching a large cog-wheel to the shaft by a friction-clutch, which is rotated
by a worm-screw operated by a hand crank. Horse-power, steam, and
hydraulic power have been used for this purpose.
Although screwing these pilings into the bottom might seem to be a very difficult
task, Ira Baker (1905:734) states that it typically could be done very quickly. He noted that:
The screw will penetrate most soils. It will pass through loose pebbles and
stones without much difficulty, and push aside boulders of moderate size.
Ordinary clay does not present much obstruction; but clean, dry sand gives the

most difficulty . . . . under favorable circumstances an ordinary screw pile can
be sunk very quickly. Screws 4 feet in diameter have, in less than two hours,
been sunk by hand labor 20 feet in sand and clay, the surface of which was 20
most difficulty. . . . under favorable circumstances an ordinary screw pile can
feet below the water. For depths of 15 to 20 feet, an average of 4 to 8 feet per
day is good work for wholly hand labor.
The soils into which the pilings were screwed at Halfmoon Reef consisted of a layer
of oyster reef underlain by sandy, clay sediment. Given Ira Bakerâs statements, it would
seem that the screw piles for the light could have been screwed in place easily by handpowered machinery. It is unknown how Lieutenant Stevens inserted the pilings, but Figure
3-10 depicts the machinery used in the 1870s to place the screw pilings for the Trinity Shoal
and Timbalier Island lighthouses in coastal Louisiana. This machinery consists of a large,
horizontal toothed gearwheel driven by two smaller gear wheels, each of which was turned
by a hand crank. The piling was inserted through the center of the large central wheel and
then screwed down into the ground. Presumably, this apparatus would have been mounted
aboard a barge that was carefully anchored over the required location.

Figure 3-10.

Archives 1871).

The wooden lighthouse structure on the Halfmoon Reef light, which stood about ten
feet above the water level, was three stories tall, with each story progressively smaller. The

38

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

bottom two stories were hexagonal in shape, with the lower story measuring about 16 ft on a
side and the second story about 7 ft on a side. The top story, which housed the light, was
circular and about 7 ft in diameter. The first floor served as the principal living quarters for
the lighthouse keeper, while the second floor contained storage and, possibly, sleeping areas
(Figure 3-11). Additionally, the original plans depict two oil drums on the second floor,
which held fuel for the lamp. The first floor was surrounded by a narrow deck and the roof
of the second story also served as a deck (see Figure 3-7). The original plans show several
interior water tanks on the main floor, however, in later years water cisterns, storerooms and
outhouses stood on the deck surrounding the main structure. A set of landing stairs to
provide access to boats extended below the first floor of the structure.

Figure 3-11. Plan of the first floor of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse (National
Archives 1857).

Construction of the lighthouse seems to have progressed quickly and with no
problems, and by June 1858 keepers were being nominated for the lighthouse. The
Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse was completed by July 1, 1858, the date the light was put into
operation. The lighthouse was fitted with a 360 degree, fixed white light of the sixth order
that stood about 37 feet above the reef. The light utilized a Fresnel lens that could be seen a
distance of approximately six miles. Three months after the lighthouse was completed, the
Inspector in Boston shipped a foghorn to Texas for the lighthouse. This horn sounded every
five minutes in foggy weather. Shortly after the light was put into operation, mariners
claimed that as they sailed in the Gulf along the Matagorda Peninsula, dunes would
periodically obscure the Halfmoon Reef light, creating a flashing signature that closely

39

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

resembled the light of the nearby Matagorda Island Lighthouse at the entrance to Pass
Cavallo. To eliminate the confusion, in October 1859 a ruby red glass chimney replaced the
clear one used on the oil lamp that illuminated the lens, changing the characteristic of the
Halfmoon Reef light to red. This involved no alterations to the Fresnel lens. The light
remained red for most of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouseâs history of service (T. L. Baker
1991:34-35; Claybourn 1986:125).
The Fresnel lens used in the lighthouse was developed by French physicist AugustinJean Fresnel in 1822. The lens consists of a series of thin glass prisms arranged in concentric
rings around a light source (Figure 3-12). These prisms bend the light source and send it out
from the lens in a horizontal plane of concentrated light. At the center, the lens is shaped like
a magnifying glass, so the concentrated beam was even more powerful. This design enables
the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the weight and
volume of material that would be required if the lens was constructed from solid pieces of
glass. The Fresnel lens was much more efficient than other types of lenses in use in the early
nineteenth century, with an ability to capture and transmit all but about 17 percent of the
light produced. Because of this efficiency, Fresnel lenses could easily throw its light 20 or
more miles to the horizon (Lighthousegetaway.com 2009).
The Fresnel lens quickly became popular in the United States and seven types of the
lens, called "orders," were developed. The first three largest orders were for seacoast lights,
while orders four through six were smaller, for harbor or bay lights. There was also a 3.5
order lens which was used mostly in the Great Lakes. The largest, first-order lenses were
huge, measuring 7 ft, 10 in tall and 6 ft, 1 inch in diameter. The smallest, sixth-order lens,
the type mounted in the lantern room of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse, was only 1 ft, 5 in
high and 1 ft in diameter (Lighthousegetaway.com 2009).

The Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse seems to have operated uneventfully until the Civil
War. Table 3-1 provides the names of the Keepers and Assistant Keepers assigned to the
light from its construction until its first deactivation in 1886. The first Keeper was W. B.
Bridges and his Assistant Keeper was Abner Reeves. Both men were assigned to their
position on February 8, 1859, eight months after the light had been put into operation.
Presumably, Walter Stevens had arranged for someone to man the light in the interim. W. B.
Bridges died in late 1859 or early 1860 and he was replaced as Keeper on February 28, 1860,
by Richard OâHanlin, a native of Ireland. Abner Reeves resigned his position shortly before
OâHanlin arrived.

* K=Keeper; AK=Assistant Keeper

Richard OâHanlin, Abner Reeves, and Evelin Bridges, believed to be the widow of
the first Keeper, all appear in the 1860 Federal census for Matagorda County. Evelin
Bridges, identified as a seamstress, and Abner Reeves, employed as a sailor, both resided in
the town of Matagorda. Richard OâHanlin appears in the 1860 Matagorda County census as
a 40-year-old native of Ireland employed as a âLight House Keeper.â OâHanlin is listed in
the household of William Simmons, identified as a 23 year old native of England employed
as âKeeper Light-House,â although National Archives records show that Simmons was the
Assistant Keeper. Also living in the Simmons household were his wife, Catherine, and Jesse
Dyson, a 25-year-old âLaborer,â and his wife Elizabeth Dyson (U. S. Census Bureau 1860).
The fact that all of these individuals were living in the same household suggests they all lived

41

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

in the lighthouse, although that would seem to have made for rather crowded living
conditions.
The first two Keepers, W. B. Bridges and Richard OâHanlin, were paid an annual
salary of $400, although this was increased to $640 in 1860, during OâHanlinâs tenure. The
salary of Assistant Keeper was initially $300, but this was raised to $400 in 1860.
Richard OâHanlin served as Keeper until the Civil War, when the lighthouse was
abandoned. In 1861, Confederate forces took over the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse, as they
did other lighthouses along the southern coast, and the lens and lamp were removed in an
effort to thwart blockading Federal ships. Although the light was extinguished, the tower
seems to have received little damage during the war, possibly because of its isolated location.
In June 1865, as Federal troops began the occupation of Texas, the lighthouse engineer in
New Orleans, M. F. Bonzano, ordered a new sixth-order, fixed red light apparatus for the
Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse, intending to put it back into operation. However, it was not until
two years later that the inspection steam launch Susan arrived to inspect the lighthouse and
estimate the cost of restoration. Restoration was finally finished in the winter of 1867-1868
and the new light was exhibited on February 20, 1868. The Lighthouse Board report for
1868 noted that repairs to the station had cost $1,946.21 (T. L. Baker 1991:36; Claybourn
1986:126). In 1867, the Eighth and Ninth Lighthouse Districts were consolidated into one
district with New Orleans as the headquarters. The Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse fell into the
newly created Ninth District.
In the summer of 1869, both the Keeper and Assistant Keeper were âRemovedâ from
their position, although the reasons for this are unknown (see Table 3-1). In 1869, John M.
Lawless was assigned as Keeper and his wife, Harriet, was named Assistant Keeper. This
couple only served for about six months before resigning. In 1869, Horace W. Crockett was
named Keeper, replacing John Lawless. When Crockett became Keeper, his wife, Jane
Crockett, was named Assistant Keeper. Horace Crockett is listed in the 1870 Federal census
for Matagorda County as âHarry Crockett,â a 28-year-old native of New York, although
other records indicate that he was actually a native of Maine. His wife Jane is identified as a
24-year-old native of âHanover,â likely a member of one of the many German families to
immigrate into Texas through the port of Indianola (U. S. Census Bureau 1870). Horace
Crockett seems to have remained as keeper through 1883. although his wife was replaced as
Assistant Keeper for part of this time. Crockett appears in the 1880 Federal census for
Matagorda County with the occupation of âKeeping Light House.â This census identifies his
wife as 26-year-old Amelia Crockett, obviously not the same person he was married to in
1870. In addition to Amelia, Horace Crockettâs household included a daughter Clara (8
years old), a son Henry (7 years old) and his father, 71-year-old David Crockett, identified as
a carpenter. It is unknown if all of these individuals resided in the lighthouse (U. S. Census
Bureau 1880).
The Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse apparently suffered little damage in the powerful
hurricane of 1875 that devastated the nearby town of Indianola. This hurricane also
destroyed the East Shoal and West Shoal screw-pile lighthouses that stood at the entrance to
Pass Cavallo, killing all four of the keepers (Lighthousefriends.com. 2009).

42

Chapter 3: Settlement and Navigation History

The Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse was an isolated station, many miles from the nearest
community. Typically, a couple of boats were moored at the station for the use of the
residents, plus a boat periodically visited the station to deliver mail and check on the water
supply. Claybourn (1986:126) notes that the Lighthouse Board provided food supplies to
isolated lighthouses, usually delivered twice a year. In 1871, the food allowance for the
Halfmoon Reef Keeper consisted of two half barrels (200 lbs) of pork, 1 half barrel of salt
beef, 2 barrels (50 lbs) of flour, 24 pounds of green coffee, 50 pounds of rice, 4 gallons of
vinegar, 10 gallons of peas and beans, 2 barrels of Irish potatoes and brown sugar. Keepers
supplemented these provided supplies with food purchased out of their own pocket, plus fish,
oysters, crabs, a variety of waterfowl and a few vegetables grown in tubs on the outside deck.
In 1882, a new lens and a kerosene lamp were installed at the lighthouse, and some
minor repairs were made. That same year, the position of Assistant Keeper was discontinued
(Lighthouse Board 1882:491). Horace Crockett left the position of Keeper sometime before
January 1884, having served for about 14 years. His replacement was James Hutchins, who
took the position as Keeper on January 14, 1884. In 1885, extensive repairs were made to
the lighthouse; however, the following year the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse received
moderate damage from the hurricane of 1886. That year, the Lighthouse Board decided to
discontinue the light, rather than make the needed repairs. The Board noted that âsince the
railroad has been completed, no steamers enter Matagorda Bay. Very few vessels now pass
up the bay, and these few are small fishing boats. . . . this light is of no practical use to
commerceâ (T. L. Baker 1991:36-37). On November 15, 1886, the light was extinguished
and the lens and lamp were removed. The structure, however, was left in place as a day
marker.
On September 15, 1902, the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse was reactivated. The
reactivation of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse corresponded to the establishment of the
nearby port town of Palacios in 1902 and the anticipation of increased vessel activity in the
vicinity of the reef, particularly small fishing and oystering boats. The structure had become
dilapidated since its abandonment 15 years earlier and extensive repairs were required to put
it back in condition. The Annual Report of the Lighthouse Board for 1902 noted that:
All the metal work was scaled and painted, all the woodwork was renewed, a
new galvanized iron roof was put on. An oil room was built with brick floor.
A storeroom and coal rooms, etc., were built. A landing ladder was put up. A
hoist for handing up coal and provisions was rigged. A fourth-order red 270
degree light is to be installed [Lighthouse Board 1902:1183].
Figure 3-13 is an early twentieth century photograph of the Halfmoon Reef
Lighthouse showing a cistern and storerooms/coalroom/outhouses on the deck of the main
floor; possibly some of the alterations made during or after the 1902 reactivation. As noted
in the 1902 Lighthouse Board report, when the lighthouse was reactivated, a five-day light,
with a fourth-order fixed red light visible for 15 miles was installed.
Extensive repairs were made to the lighthouse in 1911. These repairs included
modifying the roof to incorporate an increased pitch, an effort to address persistent leaks
reported at the station. The results of these modifications are seen in the photograph shown

43

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

as Figure 3-14. In 1912, the light was converted to an incandescent oil vapor lantern that
used less fuel and gave off a fixed white light, rather than a red light (Claybourn 1986:126).

A series of lighthouse keepers and their families were stationed at the Halfmoon Reef
Lighthouse after it was reactivated in 1902. Claybourn (1986:126) provides the names of
some of the keepers who served after the 1902 reactivation. These included Albert
Broussard, H. J. Graland, E. P. Spratley, J. M. OâNeil, George Anderson, A. E. Fox, E. H.
Rinks, Tom Parsuitt, B. W. Gomez, Adam Gomez, George Holman, and Charles M. Teller.
George W. Anderson began working at the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse in August 1917 and
remained there until he transferred to the lighthouse at Aransas Pass in 1923 (Claybourn
1968:126). Many of the Keepers at Halfmoon Reef lived at the lighthouse with their
families. This provided for rather cramped quarters and some families preferred to live on
the mainland (T. L. Baker 1991:37).
Lighthouse keepers were required to keep a journal that provided daily descriptions
on the work done, observations on weather and any unusual occurrence. These journals
show that life on a light station was often monotonous, but occasionally unusual and even
dangerous events occurred. On September 14, 1917, A. E. Fox reported on a hurricane that
hit the Halfmoon Reef station, noting:
. . . wind gradually increasing and working toward east. blowing hardest
about noon. Hurricane blowing a tide up within 2 feet of galley and spray
flying clear over steps. East Galley and cistern went about 4 p.m. East side
went about 4:30 p.m. Then partition and floors in kitchen, east room and west
room. Blowing hard nearly all of Sunday night but wind gradually abating.
Heavy rain squalls. Mud all inside of building that was left and in light tower
bedding, clothes, anything inside. . . [in Claybourn 1986:126].
In November 1920, the lighthouse log reported that numerous birds were killed flying
into the plate glass at night during a strong norther, and in December 1929 the log reported
that an 85-ft whale floundered at the lighthouse (Claybourn 1986:126).
During the depression of the 1930s, the lighthouse service had to cut back on
maintenance and personnel at minor stations like Halfmoon Reef. As a result, in 1935 the
Assistant Keeper position was discontinued and the Keeper was allowed to live ashore. In
March 1935, D. M. Nelson became the keeper. During his service the five-day lantern in the
lighthouse was replaced by an eight-day light that had to be checked only once every six
days. During his tenure, Keeper Nelson was given the additional task of maintaining other
lights in the bay and along the newly completed Intracoastal Waterway. This included as
many as twenty-one lighted beacons (Claybourn 1986:127).
D. M. Nelson was the last Keeper for the Halfmoon Reef light. After the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor, the light was extinguished, as were other lights all along the coast. In
1942, a hurricane struck the lighthouse and tore the walkway off the lighthouse and left the
wooden structure sagging on its pilings. The United States Coast Guard, the agency then
responsible for the nationâs lighthouses, decided to sell the structure rather than repair it.
The following year, local businessmen William H. Bauer and Henry Smith purchased the
lighthouse, planning to use the wooden superstructure as quarters for the night watchman at
their Point Comfort dredging business. Using a barge with a lifting crane, they were able to
remove the wooden structure from the pilings and carry it back to Port Comfort. At the time,
part of Matagorda Bay was being used as a gunnery and bombing range by the United States

45

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

Army and the crew removing the lighthouse structure were told to stop their work and leave
the site because a bombing session was about to begin. Fortunately, Henry Smith decided
not to abandon his work, and the bombing was delayed and the lighthouse structure was
successfully removed (Claybourn 1986:127; Rhodes 1985). In 1978, William Bauer and his
wife, Louise, donated the lighthouse building to the Calhoun County Historical Commission.
The structure was moved to Port Lavaca and it has been extensively renovated and repaired
and is now used as a tourist information center. The Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse building is
the oldest wooden lighthouse structure remaining in Texas.
When Henry Smith and William Bauer removed the wooden structure of the
lighthouse, it is presumed that they left portions of the iron foundation structure in place,
particularly the iron screw pilings that extended nine feet into the reef. As discussed in the
following chapter, the remote-sensing survey of Halfmoon Reef identified scattered material
on the bay floor and recorded a cluster of intense magnetic anomalies at the former location
of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. These are believed to represent the still in-place iron
screw pilings as well as other metallic debris from the lighthouse structure.

FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

Introduction
This chapter presents the conduct and results of the Phase I, cultural resources
remote-sensing, survey undertaken of the Halfmoon Reef project area. As discussed
previously, the remote-sensing survey was designed to identify and evaluate possible
significant cultural resources, as well as the extent of submerged oyster reef habitat at
Halfmoon Reef. In addition, field investigations included the collection of bottom samples,
borings and cores to examine the composition and stratification of the reef and underlying
deposits, and the collection of samples to assess water quality and flow at the time of the
survey. The results of the geological and water sampling are discussed in detail in a separate
report submitted to the Nature Conservancy, and are only briefly mentioned here.
As noted previously, Matagorda Bay has been traveled by watercraft throughout the
historic period and it was anticipated that some might have been lost on the reef over this
period. In addition, it was anticipated that some structural remains of the historic Halfmoon
Reef Lighthouse might remain on the reef. The cultural resources survey discussed in this
document followed all of the requirements for such survey established by the THC and it was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee Archeology Permit Number 5429.
The cultural resources survey of the project area was conducted in two sessions in
September 2009. The first session was begun on September 14 and continued through
September 20, when strong winds and high waves in the project area forced a stop to the
survey. The survey was completed on September 24 and 25. Overall, the survey
experienced a considerable amount of bad weather, often forcing a halt to the work for a part
of the day and, as noted, prevented any work at all for several days. The geological
assessment of the reef was conducted in a later field session.
The remote-sensing survey was undertaken by a field crew of three persons. These
were Charles Pearson (Principal Investigator/Remote-Sensing Specialist), Mark Gagliano
(Project Manager/Oyster Biologist), and David Heckman (Boat Operator/Remote-Sensing
Specialist). During the entire survey, systematic bottom polings were taken to collect
information on bottom conditions and the presence of shell beds. The cultural resources

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

remote-sensing survey encompassed approximately 1190 acres of water bottom and involved
an estimated 152 linear miles of survey. Specifics on the equipment used and the conduct
and results of the remote-sensing survey are discussed below.
Remote-Sensing Survey Procedures and Methodology
Survey coverage of the project area was achieved along a series of pre-established
survey transects spaced 20 meters apart. The initial plan was to conduct the survey along
survey lines oriented parallel to the long axis of the reef. However, field conditions dictated
some changes in this plan. Figure 4-1 depicts the survey lines as they were ultimately run.
As can be seen, lines at the northeastern end of the reef were run across the long axis of the
reef, rather than parallel to it. This was, principally, because the water depths in this area
were so shallow that it was impossible to run toward the shore (Palacios Point) and make the
required turn onto the next survey line without running aground. By running across the reef
in this area, it was possible to slowly edge into shallow water with less danger of grounding.
Ultimately, it was possible to extend the survey into water depths of about 2.5 ft before the
survey had to be suspended because of fear of damage to the remote-sensing survey
equipment, as well as running aground. The remainder of the survey area was covered with
parallel survey lines oriented along the length of the reef. This portion of the reef was
covered in two segments, because of the slight turn the reef takes to the south near its western
end (Figure 4-1).
Remote-Sensing Survey Equipment
The remote-sensing survey was conducted with equipment and procedures intended
to facilitate the effective and efficient search for magnetic and/or side-scan sonar targets and
to determine their exact location. The positioning system used was a Trimble Pro XRS
Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) system. The remote-sensing instruments
used included a Geometrics Model 882 cesium magnetometer, an Edgetech 4125P dual
frequency side-scan sonar system, and a Syquest digital recording dual frequency fathometer.
The survey utilized the navigation software Hypack Max for survey design, navigation and
data acquisition. Data were collected in Texas South-Central State Plane coordinates, based
on the 1927 North American Datum (NAD27).
Differential Global Positioning System
Accurate positioning is essential during the running of survey lines, and for returning
to recorded locations for supplemental remote-sensing operations or ground-truthing
activities. These positioning functions were accomplished using a Trimble Pro XRS
Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) system that obtains sub-meter accuracy in
positions. The Pro XRS attains differential capabilities by internal integration with a Dualchannel MSK Beacon receiver. This electronic device interprets transmissions both from
satellites in Earthâs orbit and from a shore-based station to provide accurate coordinate
positioning data for offshore or riverine surveys. Positioning was provided through
continuous real-time tracking of the moving survey vessel by utilizing corrected position data

Area depicts a general area for the project. The survey lines encompass all
areas that might be impacted by the proposed project.

provided by an on-board GPS, which processed both satellite data and differential data
transmitted from a shore-based GPS station. The differential station monitored the difference
between the position that the receiver derived from satellite transmissions and that stationâs

49

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

known position. The DGPS aboard the survey vessel constantly monitored the navigation
beacon radio transmissions in order to provide a real-time correction to any variation
between the satellite-derived and actual positions of the survey vessel. Positioning data were
recorded in Texas South Central State Plane coordinates, feet, based on the 1927 North
American Datum (NAD27).
Magnetometer
The magnetometer used was a Geometrics Model 882 cesium magnetometer. The
magnetometer was used to locate metallic objects that might represent submerged cultural
resources as well as hazards, such as pipelines, well heads and the like. The magnetometer
measures and records both the Earthâs ambient magnetic field and the presence of magnetic
anomalies (deviations from the ambient background) generated by ferrous masses and
various other sources. These measurements are recorded in gammas, the standard unit of
magnetic intensity (equal to 0.00001 gauss). Magnetic data were collected at one-second
intervals providing a record of both the ambient field and the character and amplitude of
anomalies encountered. These data were stored electronically in the navigation computer.
The magnetometer sensor was towed at distance of 18.2 m (60 ft) aft of the survey
vessel, beyond its magnetic interference. Water depths in the much of project area were less
than about 2 m (6 ft) deep and in places they were less than about 1 m (3 ft) deep. Because
of this, the magnetometer sensor was floated at the water surface using several foam
ânoodles.â
Side-Scan Sonar
The side-scan sonar used was an Edgetech 4125P dual frequency side-scan sonar
system. . The side-scan sonar is an instrument that, through the transmission of dual fanshaped pulses of sound and reception of reflected sound pulses, produces an acoustic image
of the bottom. Under ideal circumstances, the side-scan sonar is capable of providing a nearphotographic representation of the bottom on either side of the line of survey. The Edgetech
4125P utilized on this project was operated at the high frequency setting, 900 kHz. The
Edgetech 4125P has internal capability for removal of the water column from the
instrumentâs video printout, as well as correction for slant range distortion. Side-scan sonar
data are useful in searching for the physical features indicative of submerged cultural
resources. Specifically, the record is examined for features showing characteristics such as
height above bottom, linearity, and structural form. Additionally, potential acoustic targets
are checked for any location correlation with the data derived from the simultaneous
magnetometer survey.
The side-scan sonar ran off of a second Panasonic computer as an independent
system, but was connected to the Trimble DGPS navigation system for positioning. The
towfish was towed on a pole attached to the center bow of the vessel and at a depth of 0.6 m
(2 ft) below the water surface. In extremely shallow water, the towfish was raised to just
beneath the water surface in an effort to gather some data. The instrument was operated at
the 25-m-per-channel setting to collect acoustic data over a 50-m-wide (166-ft-wide) swath

50

Chapter 4: Field Investigations

on each line. This setting provided resolution detail and complete overlapping coverage with
the 20-m (66-ft) line spacing used in this portion of the project area.
Fathometer/Echosounder
A Syquest Hydrobox hydrographic dual frequency echosounder was used to obtain
information on bathymetry in the surveyed areas, but it also served to identify objects that
extend above the bottom. This system, also, provided subbotttom penetration permitting the
collection of some information on subbottom sedimentary characteristics. The transducer
was mounted to the side of the vessel and all water depths were adjusted to account for the
depth of the transducer below the water surface and to mean low lower water (MLLW).
Navigation System
The survey utilized the navigation software Hypack Max for survey design,
navigation and data acquisition. A Panasonic Toughbook computer was used to run the
navigation, digital echosounder and magnetometer and to collect position data from the
DGPS system.
Survey Vessel
The survey vessel was a 30-ft, flat-bottomed aluminum boat powered by dual
outboard engines. This flat-bottomed vessel drew only about one foot of water, making it
possible to conduct survey in waters to as shallow as 1.5 to 2 ft deep. The vessel has an
enclosed cabin and ample deck area for the placement and operation of the necessary remotesensing equipment (Figure 4-2). The vessel conformed to all U.S. Coast Guard
specifications, according to class, and had a full compliment of safety equipment.
Appropriate emergency supplies, including lifejackets, spare parts kit, tool kit, first-aid
supplies, flare gun, air horns, and paddles were aboard. The vessel was rigged with a Honda
2000 electric generator to power the electronic devices. The survey vessel was docked in the
town of Palacios and the running time from the dock to the project area was 30 to 45
minutes, depending on sea conditions.
Survey Procedures
The remote-sensing cultural resources survey was conducted along pre-plotted
transects spaced 20 m apart. As noted, at the northeastern end of Halfmoon Reef, these
survey lines ran across the long axis of the reef, in a roughly northwest-southeast direction.
The major portion of the reef was surveyed in two segments, with survey lines oriented to the
long axis of the reef. During the survey, the helmsman steered via a video monitor, linked to
the DGPS and navigational computer, which displayed the real-time position of the path of
the survey vessel along each survey track line. The speed of the survey vessel was
maintained at about 4 knots for the uniform acquisition of data. The navigation system
determined vessel position along the actual line of travel every second. One computer
recorded positioning, magnetometer and bathymetry data every second while a separate

51

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

computer recorded all side-scan sonar returns during the survey. Magnetic readings were
obtained every second which, given the vessel speed, represents a reading every three to four
feet along a survey track line. The positioning points along the line traveled were recorded
on the computer hard drive, and the magnetic and bathymetric data were also stored digitally.
As previously noted, the survey vessel was able to operate in water as shallow as
about 1.5 ft, but it was impossible to safely use the side-scan sonar in water that was less than
about 2.5 ft deep, limiting survey coverage to water of about this depth. As a result, because
of shallow water, the remote-sensing survey did not extend all the way to the shore at the
northeastern end of the project area.
Upon completion of the survey, the raw positioning and magnetometer data were
edited within the Hypack computer program. The edited file was input into the systemâs
contouring program to produce magnetic contour maps. The maps, field notes, and
magnetometer digital data were then analyzed to create a list of magnetic anomalies that were
indicative of potentially significant cultural resources relying on criteria discussed below.
Additionally, the side-scan sonar data were reviewed for any evidence of submerged objects.

52

Chapter 4: Field Investigations

Analysis and Interpretation of Remote-Sensing Data
Overall, the data collected during the survey of the project area was of good quality.
The side-scan sonar records provided a clear picture of the bottom in all of the areas
examined. In terms of cultural resources, interpretation of side-scan sonar records is straight
forward, in the sense that, generally, dense objects (such as metal or wood) are good
reflectors and produce a darker image on the record that contrasts with the return from the
bottom (Fish and Carr 1990). Garrison et al. (1989:223) note that side-scan sonar images of
shipwrecks tend to be geometrically complex, exhibit scouring, and are associated with
magnetic anomalies, while isolated pieces of modern debris tend to produce geometrically
simple images. For example, targets such as isolated sections of pipe or lengths of cable can
normally be easily identified and eliminated as possibly significant resources.
Although a considerable body of magnetic signature data for shipwrecks is now
available, it is impossible to positively associate any specific signature with a shipwreck.
The variations in the iron content, condition, and distribution of a wreck all influence the
intensity and configuration of the magnetic signature produced. In addition, the manner in
which the magnetic data are collected affect the characteristics of the signature. Despite
these problems, watercraft remains do tend to exhibit characteristic magnetic signatures that
often aid in differentiating them from other types of anomalies. When magnetic data are
used in conjunction with other data (historic accounts, use patterns of the area, diver
inspection), other remote-sensing technologies, and prior knowledge of similar targets, it can
often lead to a reasonable estimation of identity.
Traditionally, archaeologists have argued that historic shipwrecks will most
commonly produce a magnetic signature composed of a cluster of multiple anomalies (both
dipoles [i.e., pairs of magnetic highs and lows] and monopoles [i.e., a single magnetic high or
low]), normally with differing amplitudes (see Garrison et al. 1989; Irion et al. 1995; Pearson
et al. 1991). Often referred to as a âcomplexâ magnetic signature, this characteristic was
recognized in the 1960s by Clausen (1966) and Clausen and Arnold (1975:129) who noted
that the wrecks of sailing vessels in Florida and Texas produced magnetic signatures with âa
central area of magnetic distortion characterized by a number of intense and generally
localized anomalies surrounded. . . [or] interspersed by scattered, smaller magnetic
disturbances.â Others (e.g., Watts 1980, 1983), however, have demonstrated that a
shipwreck can generate much less complex magnetic signatures, sometimes simply a broadbased anomaly of less than 25 gammas. This does occur, but the distance of the sensor from
the source object is a major influence on the complexity of the signature. The farther away
the sensor is, the less likely the anomaly will be âcomplexâ because the sensor is reading the
wreck as a single large object and does not discern individual and possibly dispersed
elements of a wreck.
Recently, Gearhart (2004), relying on an assessment of 12 shipwreck magnetic
anomalies, has argued that the typical magnetic signature produced by an historic shipwreck
will be a simple dipole whose polar axis (declination) is aligned nearly parallel with the
earthâs magnetic axis. In northern magnetic latitudes, the negative portion of each shipwreck
anomaly will be located toward magnetic north, and the positive pole will be located toward

53

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

the magnetic South Pole. In addition, the declinations or orientation of the long axes of these
dipoles will vary less than 31 degrees from magnetic north. Gearhart (2004) has argued that
this observation on declination is useful for distinguishing between shipwrecks and modern
debris, because the declinations of the magnetic signature of debris tend to follow the
orientations of the debris; thus, debris anomalies might be aligned along any azimuth.
However, other recent studies have recorded non-shipwreck objects that produce magnetic
signatures displaying the characteristics Gearhart argues should be associated with historic
shipwrecks (see Gearhart et al. 2006; Pearson and Guevin 2009). These finding suggest that
Gearhartâs model needs further examination.
The field surveys were designed with the presumption that wrecks in the project area
could exist either as scattered remains or as relatively intact vessels with minimal dispersal.
Data interpretation relied on the same presumption. The strength, size and configuration of
the magnetic signature of any vessel or other submerged object depends principally upon the
amount and spatial distribution and orientation of ferrous material it contains. Pearson et al.
(1991:70) argued that the magnetic signatures of watercraft of even modest size would range
from moderate to high intensity (greater than 50 gammas) when the magnetometer sensor is
at a distance of 6 m (20 ft) or so. Additionally, wrecks of these moderate-sized vessels tend
to produce signatures that are greater than 24 or 27 m (80 or 90 ft) across the smallest
dimension. Smaller vessels, such as those that might exist within the project areas, will
produce magnetic signatures that are less intense and that cover a smaller area. While
recognizing that a considerable amount of variability does occur, Pearson et al. (1991)
suggested that this information establishes a beginning point for the identification of the
sources of the magnetic anomalies.
More recent assessments of objects and vessels (mostly steamboats) discovered in
western rivers suggest that the magnetic signatures of sunken vessels tend to be more intense
and larger than Pearson et al. (1991) had proposed. This recent work suggests that the
magnetic signatures of historic steamboat wrecks typically have a magnetic deviation of at
least 500 gammas and a duration (dimension) of no less than 33 m (110 ft), usually in the 60plus meter (200 ft) range (James et al. 1999:7; James and Krivor 2000:16-17). It is
recognized, or course, that a variety of post-wreck event factors (i.e., environmental impacts,
salvage efforts, channel improvements, etc.) will effect the magnetic signature of any
individual wreck. While recognizing that a considerable amount of variability can occur,
magnetic anomaly signatures that were less than 50 gammas in strength and less than 20 m
(65 ft) across were eliminated from consideration as possible wrecks unless other factors
(e.g., side-scan sonar images) suggested otherwise. Thus, magnetic anomalies recorded on a
single survey transect that were less than 50 gammas in strength were eliminated from
additional consideration, unless side-scan sonar records showed a feature of interest. These
relatively low thresholds are considered appropriate considering the very shallow water
found throughout the survey area. Given the shallow water in the survey area, in
combination with the close survey line spacing, it is anticipated that any shipwreck or
submerged object containing even a small amount of ferrous material would be detected
during the survey. It should be noted that these criteria do not allow a positive identification
of a historic shipwreck or a piece of modern debris, but they do provide a starting point for

54

Chapter 4: Field Investigations

eliminating some magnetic targets from consideration as possible historic shipwrecks while
selecting others for additional examination or treatment.
Results of the Remote-Sensing Survey
Bathymetry
Bathymetric information collected during the survey is presented in Figure 4-3.
Water depths along the central axis of Halfmoon Reef are on the order of 5 to 7 ft, although
at the extreme northeastern end of the reef, closest to Palacios Point, the depths decrease to as
little as 4 ft. Along the edges of the reef, the water deepens to 8 or 9 ft and at the extreme
southwestern end of the survey area, in the vicinity of the hazard light, water depths measure
up to 10 or 11 ft deep.

Figure 4-3. Bathymetry of the project area. Contour interval is 1 ft.

55

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

Magnetometer and Side-Scan Sonar Data
The results of the magnetometer survey are presented in Figure 4-4 as contoured data.
The magnetic data in this figure are contoured at a 25-gamma interval. In order to clearly
distinguish high magnetic readings from low readings, those contours falling below the
approximate median magnetic reading of 47260 gammas are shown in blue, while those
falling above this median are shown in red.
Some of the magnetic contours display considerable âlinearity,â in that they appear as
long lines paralleling the survey transects (Figure 4-4). This results from the slow change in
the earthâs magnetic field, known as diurnal change, over the course of a day in combination
with the very long running time along individual survey lines. This linearity does not effect
the interpretation of the magnetic data, because anomalies meeting the criteria for selecting
anomalies of interest as discussed above are easily distinguished within this linearity.
Several discrete magnetic anomalies were recorded in the area close to Palacios Point,
at the northeastern end of Halfmoon Reef. As seen in Figure 4-4, these appear as tight
contours in red (high readings) or blue (low readings). It is believed that these magnetic
anomalies represent small, ferrous metal objects. The very shallow water in this portion of
the survey area means that objects lying on the bottom, or that were buried only a short
distance below the bottom were only a few feet from the magnetometer sensor, which was
floated at the waterâs surface. These objects likely represent modern items lost or thrown
from commercial or recreational vessels that travel these waters. No objects were identified
on side-scan sonar imagery that could be correlated with these individual magnetic anomalies
located near Palacios Point, suggesting the sources of the anomalies were very small or were
buried. Burial seems likely given the very soft, muddy sediment identified in most of this
portion of the survey area. None of these magnetic anomalies are considered to represent
historically significant objects.
Remote-Sensing Targets in the Vicinity of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse
As shown in Figure 4-4, a cluster of several, intense magnetic anomalies was
recorded near the southwestern end of Halfmoon Reef near the location of the former
Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. Figure 4-5 presents a detailed view of this cluster of anomalies.
In this figure, these five anomalies are labeled A through E. Also shown is the location of
the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse scaled off of the 1934 navigation chart presented in the
previous chapter as Figure 3-5. Table 4-1 provides information on these five magnetic
anomalies in terms of their character, intensity and location. Coordinates given in the table
are Texas South-Central State Plane, based on the 1927 North American Datum (NAD27).
The water depth in the area of this anomaly cluster was on the order of 7 or 8 ft,
meaning objects resting on the bottom or buried beneath the bottom were at some distance
from the magnetometer sensor. The intensity of the magnetics in this cluster suggests fairly
substantial pieces of ferrous metal. Of particular interest in Figure 4-5 is Magnetic Anomaly
A, which exhibits a âcomplexâ signature in that it contains multiple highs and lows,

suggesting the presence of a grouping of multiple ferrous metal objects. This complex
anomaly exhibited a maximum magnetic deflection of 475 gammas and measured about 220
ft by 135 ft in size. Anomaly A, also, is close to the position of the Halfmoon Reef
Lighthouse as derived from the 1934 navigation chart. Given that some error is likely to
result from transferring the lighthouse position from the 1934 paper chart, it seems probable
that Magnetic Anomaly A represents structural elements and debris associated with the
former Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. It is suspected that some of the magnetics in this
anomaly are produced by iron screw pilings and other framing elements that formed the
foundation for the lighthouse structure. There is no record that any of the pilings were
removed in the 1940s with the lighthouse structure and portions of some or all are believed to
still be in place, screwed down into the reef.
The other four magnetic anomalies shown in Figure 4-5 (Magnetic Anomaly E
actually consists of two signatures located close together) exhibit either monopole or dipole
signatures, and some, are all, may be produced by individual pieces of ferrous metal. Given
that these anomalies are in the near vicinity of the lighthouse location, it is suspected that
they represent objects lost or discarded during the long period of lighthouse use or consist of
items scattered when the lighthouse was dismantled and removed in 1943.
Side-scan sonar records exhibited a relatively featureless bottom throughout the
project area. The only identified cultural features observed in the side-scan imagery consist
of a clustering of objects at the exact location of Magnetic Anomaly A. The UTM
coordinates (NAD1983, meters, Zone 14) for this location are: Easting (X) = 768498;
Northing (Y) = 3161329. Figure 4-6 presents a side-scan sonar image of these bottom
features. The evidence from the magnetometer and side-scan sonar records, in conjunction
with the known position of the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse, supports the contention that the
objects shown in Figure 4-6 are pieces of the metal support framing of the lighthouse. It is
impossibly to identify specific elements of the lighthouse structure in the side-scan sonar
image, but this scatter of material measures approximately 13 m (42 ft) across, corresponding
closely to the size of the lighthouse. It is suspected that these items consist of some of the
iron framing that supported the wooden lighthouse building and, possibly, pieces of iron
screw piles that projected above the bottom. Portions of some or all of the iron screw piles
may still be in situ and buried. Given the findings of the survey, this location has been
designated the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse archaeological site and assigned archaeological
59

site number 41MG135 by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. A completed site
form is attached as Appendix A.

the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse. Scale across the top is meters.

Although lighthouse structural features were exposed when the survey was conducted
in September 2009, it appears that these objects may be buried at other times of the year.
Interviews with shrimpers in Palacios revealed that nets could sometimes be dragged across
the old lighthouse location without hanging, but at other times nets were damaged or hung
when dragged across the location (Fred Bates, Jr. and Blackie Longoria, personal
communication 2009). This suggests that elements associated with the lighthouse are
periodically covered and uncovered with sediment.
Features associated with the Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse are considered to be
historically significant cultural remains, given their association with one of the oldest
lighthouses constructed in Texas. Recommendations for future treatment of these features
are provided in the final chapter of this report.

CHAPTER 5

CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS

Summary of Findings
The remote-sensing survey reported in this volume obtained complete and systematic
coverage of all of Halfmoon Reef where the water was deeper than about 3 ft. The survey
was conducted along lines spaced 20 m apart, encompassed approximately 1190 acres of
water bottom and involved an estimated 152 linear miles of survey. In terms of potentially
significant cultural resources, the only features identified are those related to the historic
Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse, located near the southwestern end of Halfmoon Reef. No other
historic properties were identified on either magnetic or side-scan sonar records in the area
surveyed.
Recommendations
The cluster of magnetic anomalies recorded near the southwestern end of Halfmoon
Reef appears to be related to features associated with the Half Moon Reef Lighthouse.
Specifically, Magnetic Anomaly A, shown in Figure 4-5, is believed to represent the former
location of the lighthouse and has been assigned archaeological site number 41MG135. The
location of this magnetic anomaly corresponds to a scatter of objects seen on the bay bottom
in side-scan sonar records (see Figure 4-6). Although it is impossible to identify any specific
structural element in the side-scan sonar imagery, it is believed that these objects represent
pieces of iron framing and iron screw piles that comprised the supporting structure for the
lighthouse. It is possible that portions of some, or all, of the iron screw piles are still in
place, extending down into the bay bottom. Other objects, such as debris accumulated over
the long period of lighthouse use, may also be present. It is possible that the other magnetic
anomalies located in the vicinity of Magnetic Anomaly A, identified as Magnetic Anomalies
B through E in Figure 4-5, represent pieces of debris associated with the long period of
lighthouse use, or they represent objects scattered around the area when the lighthouse was
dismantled and removed in 1943. No objects were identified in side-scan sonar records at the
locations of these other magnetic anomalies, suggesting the items producing the magnetics
are buried or are too small to be easily observed with side-scan sonar.

Remote-Sensing Survey of Halfmoon Reef

An intensive amount of historical research has brought to light the history of the
Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse and revealed its importance in Texas maritime history. There is
no doubt that it represents a historically important engineering structure. However, with the
information in hand, it is impossible to accurately assess the condition of the lighthouse
remains in terms of National Register eligibility. Despite this, the remains of the lighthouse
should be avoided and it is recommended that any oyster reef development on Halfmoon
Reef avoid the cluster of magnetic anomalies shown in Figure 4-5. Specifically, it is
recommended that no ground disturbing activities be undertaken within the âArea of Interestâ
outlined in Figure 4-5.
