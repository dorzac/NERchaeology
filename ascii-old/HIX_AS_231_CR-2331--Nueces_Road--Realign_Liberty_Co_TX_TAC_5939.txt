Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
In May of 2011, archeologists conducted an intensive linear archeological survey of the proposed
CR2331 (Nueces Road) realignment project in the City of Dayton Lakes in Liberty County, Texas. The
proposed realignment consists of constructing approximately 1,042 linear feet of new roadway within a
right-of-way (ROW) width of 100 feet in order to move the current alignment away from the encroaching
edge of the Trinity River. The proposed project will require the acquisition of permanent ROW,
earthwork, sub-grade preparation, new paving and ditches, and the refurbishment of the existing
approaches. Since the project will take place on land to be owned by Liberty County, it is subject to the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Also, since this project will utilize Disaster Funds provided by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, as administered through the Texas Department of
Rural Affairs, it is subject to coordination under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended. An intensive archeological survey was recommended for the proposed project area
(letter to the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and to Kay Howard, December 15, 2010:
Appendix A).
The field investigations for the intensive archeological survey were conducted over the entirety of the
proposed project area on May 16, 2011. The investigations consisted of a 100-percent intensive
pedestrian survey of the proposed realignment of CR2331 supplemented by mechanical trench
excavations. The total area surveyed was 2.39 acres. A total of four backhoe trenches were placed
within the project area. No cultural artifacts or features were encountered during either the pedestrian
survey or during mechanical backhoe trenching.
Based on the results of the investigations, it was the recommendation of the Principal Investigator that no
additional investigation or coordination be required for this project, and that the project should be allowed
to proceed to construction. The THC concurred with these recommendations on August 10, 2011
(Appendix A). In the event that unrecorded cultural resources are encountered during construction, all
ground-disturbing activities in the project area should cease pending notification and comment from the
THC relative to the ACT.
John Fulmer was the Principal Investigator for the project, while Josh Haefner served as the Project
Archeologist. Josh Haefner and Diamond Kapanday conducted the field investigations. The report was
authored by Diamond Kapanday and Josh Haefner. Jerrod McCleland and Andrew Poth conducted the
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data processing and produced the maps. No artifacts were
collected as a result of this investigation and, as a result, all project records and photographs will be
curated at Hicks & Company in Austin, Texas. This report serves as partial fulfillment of the
requirements of TAC Permit #5939.

Project Area Setting

PROJECT AREA SETTING
The project area occupies a high terrace along the Trinity River floodplain (Figures 1 and 2). According
to the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Barnes 1992), the proposed project area is underlain entirely by Holocene
alluvium [Qal]. This geologic formation is comprised of clay, silt, and sand formed into point bar, natural
levee, stream channel and backswamp deposits coincides with the arrival of the first humans to the
Americas. As such, these formations can potentially contain deeply buried and intact cultural deposits.
Soils mapped within the project area are Hatliff clay loam and Mantachie loam. Hatcliff clay loam,
occasionally flooded (72%), and Mantachie loam, frequently flooded (28%), are both described as loamy
alluvium of Holocene age located in floodplain settings with depths that often exceed two meters (80
inches).

Figure 1: Overview of the Trinity River facing south.

A background review of the project area utilized the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THCâs) Online
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) to determine if there are any previously recorded archeological sites or
previously conducted surveys within the project area (Appendix B: Plate I). There are no sites or
previous surveys recorded within the project area itself. The nearest archeological site, located
approximately four kilometers north-northwest of the proposed project area, is Site 41LB12, a prehistoric
open campsite. In addition to Site 41LP12, THC shipwreck #242, the river steamboat Mary Conley, lost
in 1842, is identified as being located approximately 3.8 kilometers to the north.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
Since the proposed project overlays landforms that could contain intact archeological sites, the scope of
the archeological investigations included pedestrian inspection of the entire proposed project area.
Because deep alluvial soils were mapped for the entirety of the project area, mechanical backhoe
trenching was utilized to assess this area for intact archeological deposits.
The backhoe trench excavations were designed to remove consecutive layers of earth in order to locate
and expose cultural features or occupation levels. Backhoe trenches were excavated to discernible dense
sterile clays. Backhoe excavations were directed and monitored by an archeologist certified as a
competent person trained in Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) trench safety standards.
Sediment from representative bucket sweeps (approximately one of every four bucket passes) was
screened through Â¼-inch wire mesh. Each backhoe trench was recorded on a standardized form with
notes made for stratigraphy, features, and cultural artifacts. A soil profile, plan view map, and
photographs were recorded for each trench. Locations of trenches were recorded using a Trimble
GeoExplorer GPS. After these data were recorded, the backhoe trenches were backfilled.

Results of Field Investigation

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
The intensive archeological survey of the proposed project area resulted in the discovery of no
archeological sites. A pedestrian survey was conducted of the project area. No indications of historic or
prehistoric habitation were identified as a result of the pedestrian survey. During survey it was noted that
this utility line runs adjacent to the north and west side of the current CR2331 alignment approximately
two meters to five meters from the existing paved road structure (Figure 3). The utility line adjacent to
CR2331 and an overgrown two-track were the only instances of disturbance noted within the project rea.
Predominately, the proposed project area was observed to consist of dense, largely undisturbed
vegetation, wooded with shortleaf, longleaf, and slash pines, briars, and thick shrub vegetation (Figures
4-6). A brief relief in vegetation density occurs just north of the projectâs center, where a west-to-east
running two-track bisects the project alignment perpendicularly (Figure 7).

Results of Field Investigation

Backhoe Trench Excavations
Within the proposed ROW for the realignment of CR2331, four backhoe trenches were placed at 50-75
meter intervals (Appendix B: Plate II). Trenches 1, 3 and 4 were oriented north to south and Trench 2
was oriented east to west. No cultural materials were encountered during backhoe trench excavations.
Backhoe Trench 1
Backhoe Trench 1 (BHT1) was excavated just south of an old two-track road that bisects the proposed
ROW (Appendix B: Plate II). Four distinct strata were documented for BHT1 (Figures 8 and 9).
Stratum 1 extended to a depth of 25 centimeters below ground surface (cmbgs) and was a dry, olive
brown (2.5Y 4/4) silty clay loam that terminated at Stratum 2. Stratum 2 extended from 25-45 cmbgs and
was observed to be a light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silty clay loam mottled with a moist, lighter olive
brown (2.5Y 5/6) dense clay. Both Stratum 1 and Stratum 2 had numerous root inclusions. At
approximately 45 cmbgs, sediment began to gradually lose compaction. Stratum 3 was recorded as a very
pale brown (10YR 7/4) sand. Stratum 3 terminated at approximately 130 cmbgs at a clear and wavy
boundary with Stratum 4, a black (5Y 2.5/1) compact, dense clay with noted mottles of a dark brown
(7.5YR 3/4) clay and granular iron oxide inclusions. Additionally, small-sized charcoal flecking was
noted in the upper reaches of Stratum 4, a probable indication of past root burn. BHT 1 was terminated at
a depth of 240 cmbgs.

Backhoe Trench 2
Backhoe Trench 2 (BHT2), oriented east to west, was placed approximately 50 meters southeast of BHT1
(Appendix B: Plate II). Four distinct strata were documented for BHT2 (Figures 10 and 11). The
stratigraphy in Stratum 1 was noted as a dry, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) sandy clay loam that descends to a
depth of 30 cmbgs where, at an abrupt boundary, Stratum 2 begins. Stratum 2 was observed as extending
from a depth of 30 cmbgs to 80 cmbgs and was recorded as a pale brown (10YR 7/4) sand with some
charcoal flecking throughout and distinct strong brown discoloration along root channels within the upper
third of this unit. Stratum 3 extended from 80 cmbgs to a depth of 160 cmbgs and was observed to be a
very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) mottled with light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silty clay loam with root inclusions.
Within Stratum 3, at approximately 110-120 cmbgs there is evidence of episodic flooding observed as a
series of alternating thin laminate. At 160 cmbgs, Stratum 4 began and was observed to be a black (5Y
2.5/1) clay, mottled with dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay. BHT2 was terminated at 220 cmbgs in dense
sterile clay sediment.

Backhoe Trench 3
Backhoe Trench 3 (BHT3) was placed approximately 50 meters north of BHT1 and was oriented
northwest to southeast following the current alignment of CR2331 (Nueces Road) (Appendix B: Plate
II). Stratum 1 extended to a depth of 50 cmbgs and was recorded as an olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) silty clay
loam, as was observed in BHT1 and BHT2. At a gradual boundary with Stratum 1, Stratum 2, light

grayish brown (2.5Y 6/2) sand mottled with light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) clay, began at 50 cmbgs and
extended to a depth of 90 cmbgs terminating at abrupt boundary with Stratum 3 (Figure 12). Stratum 3
was noted as a light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) sandy clay loam and extended from 90-120 cmbgs. Stratum
4, began at 120 cmbgs, was a black (5Y 2.5/1) clay mottled with dark brown (7.5Y 3/4) clay with iron
inclusions. BHT3 was terminated at 150 cmbgs in dense sterile clay sediment.

Backhoe Trench 4
Backhoe Trench 4 (BHT4) was placed approximately 75 meters southwest of BHT2 (Appendix B: Plate
II). As observed in Backhoe Trenches 1, 2 and 3, Stratum 1 was a sandy loam and was recorded as dark
grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) (Figure 13). Stratum 1 extended to a shallow depth of 10 cmbgs. At a smooth
and abrupt boundary with Stratum 1, Stratum 2 was a light grayish brown (2.5Y 6/2) loose sand that
continued to a depth of 180 cmbgs. Within Stratum 2, a single snail shell was observed. Also within this
stratum, a thin lens was observed at 120-125 cmbgs with a color of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).
Beginning at 180 cmbgs, Stratum 3 is a black (5Y 2.5/1) sandy clay mottled with dark brown (7.5YR 3/4)
clay. BHT4 was terminated at 235 cmbgs in dense ancient sterile clay sediment.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
No cultural remains were encountered during the survey of the 1,042 linear feet of the proposed CR2331
(Nueces Road) Realignment. The intensive cultural resources survey included an intensive pedestrian
survey and mechanical trench excavations (n=4), all of which were negative for cultural material.
Disturbance in the project area was minimal, consisting of a two-track road and a buried utilities line
along the current CR2331 (Nueces Road). Areas that exhibited potential to contain intact buried
archeological deposits were investigated utilizing backhoe trenches (n=4) spaced at 50-75 meter intervals
and excavated to depths of between 150 and 235 centimeters below ground surface.
Based on the results of the investigations, it was the recommendation of the Principal Investigator that no
additional investigation or coordination be required for this project relative to the ACT or for Section 106
compliance. The THC concurred with these recommendations on August 10, 2011 (Appendix A). In the
event that unrecorded cultural resources are encountered during construction, all ground-disturbing
activities in the project area should cease pending notification and comment from the THC. As no
cultural materials were recovered during this survey, all project related materials will be curated at Hicks
& Company in Austin, Texas. This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit #5939.
