Abstract
On June 19, 2014, an intensive cultural resources survey was conducted prior to the
construction of the proposed Little Elm Trail Extension Roadway in the City of Cedar
Park, Williamson County, Texas. The 9.8-acre survey was conducted within an Area of
Potential Effect (APE) that is within a 120-foot (36.5-meter) right-of-way (ROW) along
approximately 3,540 linear feet (1,079 meters) of the proposed 4,540 linear foot (1,384
meters) construction easement for an extension of Little Elm Trail roadway.
Approximately 1,000 linear feet (305 meters) of the proposed roadway in the flood plain of
Buttercup Creek has been subject to a previous cultural resources survey (Brownlow
2002), and was not resurveyed. This work was conducted in compliance with Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Texas Antiquities Code permit number
6916.
The pedestrian survey did not result in the location of any new archeological sites or
historic structures. Based on these results, no further archeological work is recommended.
Records from this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. Julie Shipp served as Principal Investigator on this project.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The City of Cedar Park is proposing to construct the Little Elm Trail Extension Roadway,
City of Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas. An intensive 9.8-acre survey was
conducted within an Area of Potential Effect (APE) that is within a 120-foot (36.5-meter)
right-of-way (ROW) along approximately 3,540 (1,079 meters) linear feet of the
proposed 4,540 linear foot (1,384 meters) construction easement for an extension of Little
Elm Trail roadway (Figures 1 and 2). An approximate 1,000-foot (305 meters) section of
the proposed roadway in the flood plain of Buttercup Creek, which would close the gap
between S. Lakeline Blvd. and Juliette Way, has been subject to a previous cultural
resources survey and was not resurveyed.
Little Elm Trail is a 4-lane divided major arterial roadway. The proposed extension
project will be consistent with the existing roadway, and will consist of a variable width,
with a raised median 20-feet (6 meters) in maximum width, two lanes on either side of
the median, with a 12-foot (3.6-meter) inside lane width and 15-foot (4.5-meter) outside
lane width, a 6-foot-wide (1.8-meter) sidewalk on one side of the road, and 10-foot (3
meter) hike and bike path on the other side of the road. The maximum depth of impact
will be seven feet (2.1 meters).
The Little Elm Trail Extension project can be divided into two segments for the purposes
of the current cultural resource survey. The first segment is approximately 2,800 feet
(853 meters) in length. Approximately 650 feet (198 meters) on the western end of this
segment is wooded and contains no existing Little Elm Trail roadway. This section of
new roadway that is currently wooded will connect the Cypress Creek neighborhood to
the Red Oaks neighborhood. The remaining 2,150 feet (655 meters) of new roadway in
this segment will widen the existing Little Elm Trail within the Red Oaks Subdivision.
The second segment of proposed new roadway will tie into two fully existing sections
separated by the Buttercup Creek flood plain. This section is approximately 1,000 feet
(305 meters) in length. Because this section was previously surveyed in 2002 (Brownlow
2002), it was not resurveyed for the current project.
The proposed cultural resources survey consisted of an intensive archeological survey of
the proposed Little Elm Trail Extension Roadway Project pursuant to the Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]). The investigation included pedestrian survey,
site recording, assessment of sites for listing on the national Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), data analysis, and
report preparation in accordance with guidelines set forth by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA).
No new archeological sites or isolated finds were recorded.

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 Environmental Setting
The project area is located in central Texas in the Blackland Prairie, approximately two
miles east of the Balcones Escarpment, a fault zone with hills to the west and north and
low relief to the east and south. The topography to the west of the Balcones Escarpment,
the Balcones Canyonlands, is hilly and characterized by the presence of springs, karstic
sinks, caves, and rock shelters. The Blackland Prairie is characterized by low relief and
dark clays that support prairie vegetation along with small woods often found along low
gradient streams. The project area is within the “Oak-Mesquite-Juniper Parks”
designation, as noted on the Texas Parks and Wildlife “Vegetation Types of Texas” map
(McMahan et al. 1984). The proposed project area runs along Buttercup Creek and its
tributaries, which now flow into the Soil Conservation Service Site 6 Reservoir.
2.2 Soils
The soils in the area are mapped as the Denton-Eckrant-Doss association (NRCS 2014).
These soils consists of moderately deep, shallow, to very shallow, calcareous, clayey,
cobbly, and stony soils formed in indurated fractured limestone or limey earth on
uplands. Three soil series are mapped within the APE (Figure 3). However, the shallow
Eckrant cobbly clay is the predominant soil in the area requiring cultural resource survey.




Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes (EaD)
Fairlie clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes (FaB)
Oakalla soils, channeled (Oc)

Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes (EaD) – This soil is generally found in
irregular shapes on undulating uplands ranging in size from 50 to 500 acres. The surface
consists of around 13 inches of a dark grayish brown cobbly layer. The underlying
material consists of coarsely fractured indurated limestone. The soil is moderately
permeable as long as it does not dry to the point of cracking. It is well drained, and the
available water capacity is very low.
Fairlie clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes (FaB) – This sloping soil is generally found along
broad flats and drainageways. The surface layer is dark grayish-brown clay about 21
inches thick with a lower layer to 46 inches with gray clay in the upper layer and dark
grayish brown in the lower. The soil is moderately permeable as long as it does not dry
out to the point of cracking. It is well drained and the available water capacity is very
low.
Oakalla soils, channeled (Oc) – This soil occupies narrow stream valleys in bottom land
channels. The surface layer consists of a dark brown loam about 7 inches thick, followed
by a dark brown clay that is approximately 16 inches thick. The underlying material is
dark brown sandy clay loam roughly 66 inches deep.

Archaic in that burned rock features are present, but they are not as large or ubiquitous as
those associated with the Archaic. Other artifacts, features, and faunal remains seem
more similar to those found later in the Archaic.
Archaic (Collins 1995:383-385) sites in Central Texas are most often associated with the
use of heated rock in hearths, ovens, middens, and scatters. The period as a whole is
defined by the intensified use of local resources and diversity of material culture in
comparison to the Paleoindian period. The climate ranged from mesic (relatively moist)
in the Early Archaic and the later part of the Late Archaic and xeric (relatively dry)
during the Middle Archaic and beginning of the Late Archaic. Subsistence during mesic
times is centered on the live-oak savanna while a shift in emphasis toward xerophytes
may have occurred during xeric intervals.
The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups, primarily from
the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics into the archeological
record takes place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans
inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
3.2 Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when Spanish explorers traveled through the
region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas. Captain Alonso De León
followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop several times during the 1680s,
and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and
Captain Domingo Ramon, a Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and
camped on the banks of Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them
Arroyo do las Bendítas Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, the
Marques de Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through
present-day Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions. In the mideighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established along the San Gabriel
River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753, drought and disease
made the missions uninhabitable, and Spanish influence in the area declined (Odintz
2002).
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. In 1835,
continual attacks by local Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and his company
of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the headwaters of Brushy
Creek, in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson Fort, as it was called, was
abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several veterans
of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838, Dr. Thomas Kenney and his family
built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson County. Kenney’s Fort
7

became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County. However, Indian attacks were
a frequent problem, and numerous settlers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians. By
1846, the Indian threat had waned and settlement in the region increased. In 1848, the
Texas legislature established Williamson County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a
Milam County Judge and state senator.
By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the San
Gabriel (Odintz 2002), but a few families were living in the western half. During the
1850s and 1860s, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up around the county.
Although urbanization and industrialization increased somewhat, the bulk of the county
remained rural and agricultural. The majority of the families lived on subsistence farms in
log houses and raised corn. During the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave population
increased and the agricultural patterns within the county became more diverse. Wheat
and corn were the predominant crops in the Blackland prairies, and cattle and sheep
ranching was widespread throughout the county. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but
it was not a significant cash crop.
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War but picked up again in
the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the expansion of cotton
farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisholm trail, which was established
in 1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle drives passed through or originated
in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s were also marked by the arrival of railroads
to Williamson County (Odintz 2002).
By the early twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry in
importance. With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm tenancy
developed. As late as 1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by owners. By
1890, 43 percent of the farms were worked by owners, and by 1930, only 29 percent of
the farms were worked by owners. The tenancy rates continued to drop during the Great
Depression (Odintz 2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of soil
depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil infestation.
The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation and encouraged
farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton production was reduced by nearly
half, while sorghum and wheat became important crops. Along with cattle and sheep,
poultry farming intensified (Odintz 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped areas of
Williamson County meant urban populations now had easier access to the Hill Country
and vice versa. The consolidation of rural schools also meant children could now attend
schools outside of their rural communities. For example, during the 1910s and 1920s,
Rock House School was one of the largest schools in Williamson County. In 1903, the
school boasted a population of 96 students and 2 teachers. The school was consolidated

5.0 SURVEY METHOD
Following the literature review, a 100% pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to
locate any historic properties that may be adversely affected by the construction of the
roadway, and to assess the eligibility of said properties for listing on the NHRP or for
designation as a SAL. This survey was conducted under guidelines set forth by the THC
and CTA.
The subject area was surveyed at 50-foot (15-meter) transect intervals within the 120-foot
(36.5-meter) wide APE. Records of investigation included a daily journal, photographs,
and photograph log. Spatial information recorded with a Trimble GeoXT.
Shovel tests were to be excavated if settings were encountered that appeared to yield
potential for buried cultural horizons and/or if the ground surface visibility is less than 30
percent. Shovel tests are typically excavated at least 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter to
the bottom of Holocene deposits, if possible, are dug in 10 cm levels, and the excavated
sediments were screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth unless high clay or water
content requires that the material be troweled through or sorted by hand. Shovel tests and
any other pertinent features would be recorded on logs and the locations of the tests
would be recorded on a Trimble GeoXT GIS unit.
Newly discovered sites were to be assigned a temporary field designation and a digital
TexSite Archaeological Data Collection forms would be submitted to TARL for the
assignment of trinomials. The location of each archeological site was to be recorded on a
USGS 7.5-minute topographic map, and a sketch map will be drawn showing the location
of all salient features at the site. The site setting and features would be photographed.
This was a non-collection survey and any diagnostic artifacts encountered were to be
photographed and drawn in the field. If surface visibility is less than 30 percent at these
sites, then a minimum of six shovel tests would be executed to delimit site boundaries.
6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
Segment 1
The approximate 2150-foot (655-meter) section of proposed Little Elm Trail roadway
through the Red Oaks Subdivision, including a small section of paved road south of
Liberty Oaks Blvd, was within the ROW of the existing road. The area had been
disturbed by previous roadway and subdivision construction, including utility lines
(Figures 5 and 6). The location for the proposed new lane is within the ditch of the
existing Little Elm Trail. No shovel tests were placed within the subdivision because of
the heavy disturbance and exposed bedrock at the surface.

Roadway, within the Red Oaks Subdivision, near Reed Elementary School, facing east.

Roadway, within the Red Oaks Subdivision, facing south from Liberty Oaks Blvd.

The second area that was surveyed was the 650-foot (198-meter) wooded area to the
southwest of Liberty Oaks Blvd. This area had bedrock exposed at the surface and good
ground surface visibility, typically greater that fifty percent (Figure 7). For these reasons,
no shovel tests were placed within the wooded area.
Seven pieces of historic glass, including a fragment of milk glass with an externally
threaded finish, three fragments of colorless glass, including one bottleneck, a fragment
of purple glass, the bottom of a glass Clorox bottle, and a fragment of cobalt glass were
located during the survey (Figure 8). However, the small scatter of glass was located
approximately fifteen feet outside of the ROW on the western side of the APE, near an
old two-track road. The road runs from the northwest to the southeast toward Stillhouse
Hollow Lake. The historic debris is likely associated with the road. Regardless, the
historic artifacts were outside of the APE and thus not further investigated.
Approximately thirty warranty tags from Martin-Decker Totco Inc. were found in a pile
in proximity to the glass. The Martin-Decker Totco., Inc. plant, which manufactures oil
and gas field equipment, is adjacent to the project area and the tags were possibly
dumped at a later date than the historic glass.

Segment 2
This segment of an approximately 1,000-foot (305-meter) section of the proposed Little
Elm Trail roadway extension is in the flood plain of Buttercup Creek. This section of the
APE was previously surveyed by Horizon Environmental in 2002 and was not
resurveyed. The 2002 survey resulted in the recording of site 41WM1038 within the
flood plain. According to the Atlas, the site was determined ineligible for listing on the
NRHP in 2012.
7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In advance of the construction of the proposed new sections of Little Elm Trail roadway
in Cedar Park, Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey in
accordance with CTA and THC guidelines. The 9.8-acre survey was conducted within an
APE that is within a 120-foot (36.5-meter) ROW along approximately 3,540 linear feet
(1,079 meters) of the proposed 4,540 linear foot (1,384 meters) construction easement for
an extension of Little Elm Trail. This work was conducted in compliance with Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]). No new archeological sites were recorded.
Based on these results, no further archeological work is recommended.
