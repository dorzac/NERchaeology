Ron Ralph to Present April
Program
Ron Ralph, past President of the
Texas Archeological Society, will present
April’s program on Ft. Jefferson, a mid
1800s fort located 70 miles off of Key
West, FL. Originally built with 16 million
bricks to protect the Gulf of Mexico shipping lanes, the fort is more famous for its
use during the Civil War as a dumping
ground for criminals from Union armies. It
has been called America’s Devil’s Island.
Ron is among the leading cave archeologists in Texas. He began studying
caves and archeology in California in 1963
and has worked extensively throughout the
southwestern United States and much of
northern Mexico. After graduating from the
University of Texas, he worked 13 years as
an archeological consultant before joining
the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
(TPWD) for 21years. Since retiring from
TPWD in 1997, he has returned to consulting and has worked as an independent contractor since 2000.

Butterfield Stage Station
Excavated at
Ft. Chadbourne

Excavations began on March 31 on
the Butterfield Station located at Ft. Chadbourne by CVAS and the SMART group
from Oklahoma.
The foundations of five rooms have
been discovered. Floor joist, under 40
centimeters of earth, have been exposed in
the rooms. A two sided fire place was located between two of the rooms. Enough
stones from the fallen walls were removed
to go a long way in reconstructing one of
the largest of the Butterfield stations.
Excavations were completed on
April 10.

Friends and colleagues: Historical archaeology has a special knack for connecting
to present-day communities. Popular support for, and participation in, an archaeological excavation is an important part of Finding Our Foundation: The Preservation of the
Elk Run Anglican Church Site, the latest
video feature on our nonprofit streamingmedia Web site, The Archaeology Channel
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org).
Colonial Virginians and the Church of
England established Elk Run Church in the
1740s. After the Revolutionary War, it became part of the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia. In the following decades the church
was abandoned and disappeared, but remained in the memory of local families. The
church’s first rector, James Keith, was the
grandfather of U.S. Supreme Court Chief
Justice John Marshall. This video documents the archaeological investigation of the
church, beginning with the first survey in
1999, and its development as a historical
park.
This and other programs are available
on TAC for your use and enjoyment. We
urge you to support this public service by

National Park.
CVAS will again travel to Big Bend National Park on the weekend of the 18, 19, and
20th of April. Camping will be in the Basin.
Reservations are not accepted after April 15, so
sites are on a first come basis.

Mariscal Mine Today

Saturday, we will travel to the Mariscal Mine.
From there, we will continue on the River
Road to Johnson Ranch and on to the Castolon
Road. This is a 51 mile drive over unimproved
roads and requires high clearance vehicles.
This route will allow members to see
many sites such as the location of the former
village of Glenn Springs, pictographs, and
views in the Big Bend National Park most visitors will never get a chance to see.

Glenn Springs ca. 1916

Chef Jack will be in charge of the Saturday
evening meal for us.
A short hike of a couple of miles is
planned for Sunday, We are still looking for
one that will allow us to start home that afternoon. Contact Claude at 949-9077 if you plan
to go.

The Stone Graver
By Tom Ashmore
The graver is an Indian artifact that can be easily overlooked if you are not careful. It
can look like just another piece of broken chert, but a closer look will show you that it is
worked way too much to be just a broken piece. The graver will have one or more sharp spurs
on it in the most worked part of the piece. These spurs are intentional and were used for some
kind of engraving. Thus, the name graver.
I recently found my second graver near Dove Creek where I live which got me to do
more research on it and thinking about its use. The first thing I noticed about both gravers is
they fit into my hand perfectly to place the spur in just the right position for doing the engraving. On both there is a location chipped away for placement of the thumb and the forefinger.
The opposite side of the stone is smooth so you can curl your second finger and use it to put
pressure against with your thumb.
In my research I have read several theories about what the graver may have been used
for. In the book Arrowheads & Stone Artifacts: A Practical Guide For The Amateur, George
Frison theorizes it may have been used for cutting hides or tattooing the skin. Gravers are not
to the sharpness that would be required for any reasonable tattooing. Also, gravers have been
found at both Paleo and Archaic sites in practically every state from the East Coast to the West
Coast as well as Mexico and Alaska. I seriously doubt these were all being used for tattooing.
As for cutting hide, although these probably could cut hide, I found the first graver on a small
hill where my house stands. This was probably a day site for the hunters to sit and watch for
animals, passing the time working with their tools and weapons. Since the graver was at a
probable hunting site it probably was not used by the women who were the ones that did hide
preparation.
I believe the graver was used to engrave ornamental designs onto the wooden or bone
pieces of the weapons (atlatl, knife handles, etc.) This would explain finding it at a hunting
site. Also, making your weapon with personal ornamentation would be a universal human
characteristic, explaining the existence of these tools in so many places around the world.
The next time you see a large broken piece of chert look for some purposeful chipping
around the edge and a spur jutting from it. It might be a graver.
