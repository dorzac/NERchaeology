This report documents a cultural re source inventory conducted on 6,195 acres along the shoreline of
Belton Lake in Central Texas, includi ng 5,125 ac res in Bell Count y and 1,070 acr es in Coryell County.
The inventory consisted of a pedestrian survey accompanied by 2,320 shovel tests. In addition, a boat
survey alon g th e sh oreline was co nducted. All work was o n lands owned b y the federal government
and mana ged b y the USACE, Fort Worth Dis trict. The inventory documented 46 previously kno wn
sites and 5 1 newly discovered sites. Of th e 2,320 shovel tes ts e xcavated, 334 tests c ontained buried
cultural material; the remaining 1,986 te sts were negative. All artifacts recovered from shovel t esting
will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Ten of the 97 sites are historic and 87
are prehis toric. Three prev iously re corded si tes are recom mended to be subsum ed into oth er sites .
Twenty sites are assessed as having an undetermined potential for further research and are
recommended as being of unknown NRHP eligibility; these sites should be protected and avoided. The

Abstract
From January through May of 2010, Ecological Communications Corporation (EComm)
conducted a cultural resource inventory of 6,195 acres owned by the US Government and
managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) along the shoreline of Belton Lake
in Central Texas. The survey included 5,125 acres in Bell County and 1,070 acres in Coryell
County. The surveyed areas are generally located along, or in close proximity to, the Belton
Lake shoreline. The inventory consisted of a pedestrian survey accompanied by 2,320 shovel
tests. In addition, a boat survey along the shoreline was also conducted. All work was on lands
owned by the federal government and managed by the USACE.
The inventory recorded 97 archaeological sites, including 46 previously recorded sites and 51
newly discovered sites. Of the 2,320 shovel tests excavated, 334 tests contained buried cultural
material, including 324 positive tests on sites and 10 isolated positive tests. The remaining
1,986 tests were negative. All artifacts recovered from shovel testing will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Ten of the 97 sites are historic and 87 are prehistoric. Three previously recorded sites were
found to be contiguous with adjacent sites and are recommended to be subsumed into those
sites. Of the remaining 94 sites, 20 are assessed as having an undetermined but non-negligible
potential for further research. These 20 sites are recommended as being of unknown NRHP
eligibility and are recommended for protection and avoidance. The final 74 sites are assessed
as having no potential for additional research and are recommended as not eligible for listing
on the NRHP; no further work is warranted on these sites.

Acknowledgments
The authors would like to thank Dan McGregor, archaeologist at the United States Army Corps
of Engineers, Forth Worth District (USACE), who facilitated this project. At Belton Lake,
USACE staff members were extremely helpful throughout every phase, including Conservation
Specialist Robert G. Adams, Reservoir Manager Daniel Thomasson, Park Ranger Todd Spivey,
and GIS Specialist Murray W. McCarley. The authors would like to extend a special thanks to
Fort Hood archaeologists Richard Jones and Sunny Wood for visiting some of the sites in the
project area and offering their advice, providing us with information about sites under their
management, and providing us with a 1938 aerial of Belton Lake.
The Principal Investigator for this investigation was Nick Trierweiler. Fieldwork was directed
by Project Archaeologist Antonio Padilla, assisted by Crew Chief Kevin Stone, with additional
support from Jon Dowling and Emory Worrell. Field Technicians serving on the project included
Noel Steinle, Greg Sundborg, Iakov Doumanoff, Nathan Divito, Daniel Rodriquez, and Arielle
Danielson. Jason Whitaker compiled cultural and environmental background research, and
GIS Specialist Joel Butler created the maps. Property deed research was conducted at the Bell
County courthouse by Laura Newcomer and Rachel Feit. The report was edited and assembled
by Maggie McClain and printed by Ginny’s Printing, Austin, Texas.

Project Description
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible
for managing certain federally owned lands in Texas in association with lakes reservoirs and
navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 12,385 acres at Belton
Lake in Bell and Coryell counties.
The USACE is required by federal law to inventory cultural resources located on properties it
manages. In compliance with Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89–665 et seq.), the current investigation was
authorized by the USACE to identify any archaeological sites, buildings, structures, or other
resources that may be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP).
Ecological Communications Corporation (EComm) conducted a cultural resource inventory
by pedestrian survey of selected areas of USACE property surrounding and adjacent to
Belton Lake; the pedestrian survey was accompanied by more than 2,300 shovel tests. All
work was on lands owned by the federal government and managed by the USACE.

1.1	Location
The majority of the project area is in the northwest portion of Bell County, with the
northernmost tip crossing into Coryell County. The surveyed areas are generally located
along, or in close proximity to, the Belton Lake shoreline (Figure 1-1). Belton Lake lies
within the Brazos River basin on the Leon River approximately 3 miles, or 5 kilometers
(km) northwest of Belton. Construction of the dam began in 1949 and was completed in
1954 with the impoundment of the reservoir (Breeding 2010). Elevation of the conservation
pool varies seasonally; normal elevations are 594 feet (ft) above mean sea level (amsl),
with a record high of 634 ft amsl recorded on March 6, 1992, and a record low of 582 ft
amsl recorded on December 27, 1978. Flood storage capacity is 662 ft amsl. The reservoir
provides flood control, general recreation, wildlife habitat, water conservation, and a water
supply for Killeen, Fort Hood, and other surrounding areas.

1.2 	Survey Segments
Following contract award and prior to the start of field work, the USACE provided EComm
with GIS shape files delineating the areas to be surveyed. Using ArcGIS, EComm determined
that these areas totaled 6,195 acres. Most of the survey area was contained within a few
continuous shoreline parcels. For logistical reasons, EComm subdivided the shoreline

into manageable survey segments on the basis of geographical features, parks, wildlife
management areas, and roads. In this manner, 19 survey segments were thus identified.
Presented in rough geographic order beginning in the northernmost part of Belton Lake,
the segments are designated Horseshoe Bend, Iron Bridge, Cowan, Winkler, White Flint,
Stampede Creek, Aycock, Leona Park, McGregor Park, Owl Creek, Jubilee Springs, Cedar
Ridge Park, Cedar Creek, Morgan’s Point, Tanyard, Temple Park, Miller Springs, West Cliff
Park, and Sparta Valley Park. All of the survey segments were on the shoreline of Belton
Lake with the exception of the Cedar Creek segment. The segments range in size from a
maximum of 1,156 acres (Horseshoe Bend) to a minimum of 75 acres (Tanyard), with a
mean area of about 326 acres (Table 1-1).

Project Description

Horseshoe Bend

The Horseshoe Bend survey segment totals 1,156 acres and is located in Bell and Coryell
counties within the Iron Bridge and the Horseshoe Bend wildlife management areas. The
survey segment is in a low-lying area, surrounded by pasture land to the east and west and
a pronounced ridgeline along the southeastern edge; it is bisected by the meandering Leon
River and is scarred by many oxbow lakes and relic river channels. The southern portion of
the survey segment consists of a broad alluvial terrace to the southeast and an upland terrace to
the southwest, both of which serve as a setting for archaeological sites. Due to the topographic
setting, this survey segment is prone to flooding. The Horseshoe Bend survey segment measures
approximately 3,339 meters (m) east–west and 2,185 m north–south at its widest parts, and is
located on the Eagle Springs USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle (Figure 1-2).

1.3	Natural Environment
The project area is on USACE property adjacent to the Leon River and its tributaries within the
Brazos River basin. The environmental setting of the project area consists of two physiographic
zones: the Cross Timbers and Prairies and the Blackland Prairie. Due to the juxtaposition of the
two physiographic regions, the project area straddles a transition zone between the Texan and
Balconian biotic provinces as defined by Blair (1950). The unique environmental setting of the
project area features wide topographic relief, diverse vegetation communities, and a diverse
habitat for wildlife.
The Texan Biotic Province constitutes a broad ecotone between the forests of the Austroriparian
province and the Balcones Escarpment. The area was once characterized by tall-grass prairies
supported by clayey soils. Cultivation, however, has led to sandy soils, which are characterized
by combination oak-hickory forests, dominated usually by post (Quercus stellata) and blackjack
(Quercus marilandica) oaks and hickory (Carya texana). Some characteristic associations of
the Austroriparian province occur locally. An outstanding biogeographic aspect of this province
is the interdigitation of forest and grassland associations.
There are no endemic species of vertebrates in the Texan Province. Austroriparian species
are usually restricted to the oak-hickory forests, floodplain forests, peat bogs, and marshes.
Grassland species are largely limited to the prairies. Mammals typical of this province
include: Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox
squirrel (Sciurus niger), Louisiana pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse
(Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton
rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit (S.
aquaticus). Animals typical of grasslands of this province include the thirteen-lined ground
squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), hispid pocket mouse (Chaetodipus hispidus), deer
mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), and black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus).
Typical anuran species to this province are the Hurter’s spadefoot (Scaphiopus holbrookii
hurteri), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), gray treefrog
(Hyla versicolor/chrysoscelis), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea), bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana),
southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), and eastern narrowmouth toad (Microhylla
carolinensis).
The Balconian Biotic Province has a varied topography. In the southern and eastern sections
of the province is a rugged topography forged through dissection from local rivers and their
tribuataries. Limestone caverns and springs are common features of this section of the Balconian
Province. In the central and northwestern parts, surface drainage is poor, and broad, relatively
level uplands exist between the canyons of the streams.
Three vegetational regions have been defined for the Balconian Province. The oak-hickorymesquite region corresponds to the Llano Uplift. The oak-cedar region corresponds to the
dissected southern and eastern part of the Edwards Plateau and extends beyond the limits of the

Ecological Communications Corporation

21

Chapter 1

Project Description

Balconian Province. Finally, the live oak-mesquite savanna lies in the central and northwestern
part of the Balconian Province (Blair 1950).
Fifty-seven species of mammals are known from the Balconian Province, but none of these
species are restricted to the province. The mammalian fauna of the Balconian contains a strong
influence from the Chihuahuan species that range into the area from the west, and from the
Austroriparian province to the east.
Some common mammals are the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novimcinctus), fox squirrel
(Sciurus niger), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), black rat (Rattus rattus), house
mouse (Mus musculus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana).

1.4	Climate
Central Texas is located in a zone of transition between regional climates. The climate is
considered by many (Norwine et al. 1995; Peterson 1995; Yelderman 1993) to be subtropical,
but a wide range of regional extremes are found in this area. It is not uncommon, however, for
cold fronts to rapidly decrease the temperature below the mean low (Bomar 1983). Generally,
mean annual temperature varies from 68°F in the south (Williamson County) to about 64°F
in the north and west (Griffiths and Orton 1968). Extremes ranging from 0°F to 110°F are not
uncommon for winter and summer, respectively (Tharp 1926). Bell County temperatures range
from an average high of 96°F in July to an average low of 36°F in January. Similarly, Coryell
County has a mean high of 97°F in July and a mean low of 33°F in January.
Precipitation for the area decreases from east to west. In general, mean annual precipitation
decreases by one inch for each 15 miles from east to west within this region (Bomar 1983).
This is due, in part, to the influence of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. Like much of Texas,
this region is prone to drought, but at other times it receives too much rain in a short period of
time (Sharpless and Yelderman 1993). Severe storms and some of the largest rainfalls in the
United States have occurred in this area. Hayward et al. (1992) notes that all the point rainfall
records for North America are held within a 50-mile belt east and west of a line from Dallas
through Waco, Austin, and San Antonio. The yearly precipitation record for Texas (109.38
inches) is also from the region (Bomar 1983). The concentration of rain in the spring and
fall coupled with hot, dry summers makes the water problems of the area even more acute
(Yelderman 1993). Major storms and hail are also a problem for the area.

1.5	Bedrock Geology and Soils
Three geological bodies underlie the project area. The Undvided Washita and Fredericksburg
Group (Kwf) dates to the Early Cretaceous period (100 million years ago). Its primary and
secondary rock types are clay or mud and limestone, respectively. The third geological body
in the project area consists of Terrace Deposits (QT). These materials date to the Pleistocene
and Holocene epochs (2.5 million years ago to present). Its primary and secondary rock types

22

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

are terrace deposits and sand, respectively. Finally, alluvium (QAL) dates to the Holocene. Its
primary and secondary rock types are sand and silt, respectively (Barnes 1970).
The soils of Central Texas vary widely from the “black waxy” soils of the Blackland Prairie to
the easily erodible sands of the Western Cross Timbers. The focus here is on those soils in the
Limestone, or Lampassas, Cut Plain of the Cross Timbers Ecoregion, which is relevant to the
project area. Mollisols are found in the Limestone Cut Plain. These soils are characterized by
having “…deep, dark, friable, and relatively fertile surface horizon (or horizons) known as a
mollic epipedon (Buol et al. 2003:301).” There is considerable biological activity associated
with Mollisols, with earthworms, rodents, and various insects typically playing an important
role in the formation of these soils.
A review of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Web Soil Survey (2010) showed a
total of 39 different soil types within the project area. Table 1-2 summarizes the types of soils

under each survey segment description.
The GIS shape files provided by the USACE prior to survey precisely delineated the boundaries
of each survey segment. With the exception of the land-locked Cedar Creek segment, each of
the survey segments was along the shoreline of Belton Lake and these segments all included
some small amount of USACE property that was underwater. With the exception of the
Iron Bridge, Stampede Creek, and Cedar Ridge Park segments, the underwater portions

contained a few acres each and averaged about 2.5 percent of each segment. However, at
the three segments mentioned, the GIS shapefiles contained significant amounts of USACE
property that was offshore and underwater (see Figures 1-3, 1-4, and 1-10). These portions
could not be surveyed.

Cultural Context
2.1	Culture History
The project area is located in the Central Texas Archaeological Region (Perttula 2004, Turner
and Hester 1999). Based on extensive research conducted by Black (1989), Collins (1995),
Hester (2004), Johnson et al. (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), Sorrow et al. (1967), Suhm (1957,
1960), Suhm et al. (1954), and Weir (1976), Central Texas has a well-established chronological
sequence beginning 12,000 years ago. The chronological sequence of Central Texas is divided
into four cultural stages: Paleoindian (11,500–8800 BP), Archaic (8000–1200 BP), Late
Prehistoric (1200–400 BP), and Historic (400 BP–present). Although only four cultural periods
are generally recognized when discussing the chronological sequence of Central Texas, new
research conducted in the area is shedding light on the possibility of an earlier period of human
occupation known as the Pre-Clovis.

2.1.1 Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited North America before 11,500 BP, solid evidence
does not as of yet support their existence. The argument that artifacts recovered from Levi
Rockshelter in Travis County are older than Paleoindian (Alexander 1983:133–145) is not
supported because the radiocarbon dates are not clustered, and there are no distinct artifact
and extinct fauna assemblages within well-defined stratigraphy (Collins 1995:380–381).
Other sites where assemblages are purportedly pre-Clovis include Friesenhahn Cave (Krieger
1964) and the Waco Mammoth Site (Fox et al. 1992). Human behavior is inferred on stone
artifacts from Friesenhahn Cave and on mammoth bones at the Waco Site; however, problems
of context or dating exist at both sites (Collins 1995:380–381). The Gault Site in Bell County,
Texas, has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and with
artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances of
providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292–
294; Collins 2009; Collins and Brown 2000).

2.1.2 Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian stage was commonly characterized throughout Texas by nomadic big-game
hunters who heavily relied on megafauna of the Pleistocene (e.g., mammoth, mastodon, bison,
camel, and horse) for subsistence (sensu Willey 1966). However, a more accurate description
of this stage is presented by Bousman et al. (1990:22): “…this period may have seen use by
small, mobile bands of nonspecialized hunters and gathers occasionally utilizing megafauna
perhaps only as the opportunity arose.” Thus, according to Bousman et al. (1990), Paleoindians
used a wider variety of resources than previously thought. Evidence of this broader resource
Ecological Communications Corporation

33

Chapter 2

Cultural Context

subsistence is based on the works of Johnson (1977), Collins (1998:1505–1506), and Collins and
Brown (2000). Johnson (1977) reviewed reports on numerous Paleoindian sites that indicated
a range of small and medium fauna were harvested in addition to big game. Investigations at
the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235), the Gault site (41BL323), and Lubbock Lake (41LU1)
provide evidence of small and medium faunal remains, such as turtle, rabbit, squirrel, snakes,
gopher, and deer, associated with megafaunal remains, i.e., bison and mammoth (Collins
1998:1505–1506). Clovis and Folsom points are the primary diagnostic artifacts associated
with this stage (Collins 1995; Turner and Hester 1999).

2.1.3 Archaic Period
The Archaic period is typically divided into three sub-stages: Early, Middle and Late, and spans
nearly 7,000 years of prehistory. Burned rock middens are the primary cultural marker of this
period (Collins 2004:119). These piles of burned limestone, sandstone, and other lithic debris
represent the remains of multiple ovens that were used, reused, and discarded over time. Their
appearance signifies a shift from a big-game hunting subsistence strategy to a less mobile,
generalized subsistence strategy. Projectile points also changed; lanceolate-shaped points gave
way to dart points that were stemmed and barbed (Black 1989). During the Archaic period the
climate changed, from the wet and mild conditions seen in the Paleoindian, to warmer and drier
conditions. Researchers believe that the changes in climate influenced prehistoric subsistence
strategies (Story 1985:38–39; Weir 1976).
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic is still relatively obscure in the archaeological record. The majority of Early
Archaic sites are distributed around the Edwards Plateau along the eastern and southern margins,
suggesting concentrations near reliable water sources with a variety of food resources. These
sites are generally described as small with highly diverse tool assemblages. Cultural material
associated with Early Archaic sites are points, specifically Angostura, Early Split Stem, and
Martindale-Uvalde (Collins 2004), Clear Fork and Guadalupe bifaces, manos, hammerstones,
burins, metates, circular scrapers, and various biface styles (Osburn et al. 2007), which suggest
specialized tool usage. In addition, burials have been found associated with this stage, although
in very few numbers (Prewitt 1981; Story 1985).
Middle Archaic
During the Middle Archaic, the climate became very warm and dry. The number and size of
burned rock middens from this period increases dramatically, leading many archaeologists to
posit not only a population increase, but also an intensification of earth oven food processing.
Project point types that occur during the Middle Archaic are Bell, Andice, Calf Creek, Taylor,
Nolan, and Travis. Of these points, Bell, Andice, Calf Creek, and Taylor mark a change in
lithic technology from what is seen in the Early Archaic. Other materials found among Middle
Archaic assemblages are wooden and bone implements, and plant processing implements.
Burials during this stage become more frequent than in the previous stage.

Late Archaic
During the Late Archaic, climatic conditions once again became more mesic. Cultural
characteristics observed in the Middle Archaic carried over into the Late Archaic, and were
incorporated with newly developed traditions. The expansion of trade networks during this
period is evident through the exchange of coastal materials such as ornamental shells, which
were likely exchanged for both finished tools and raw material (Story 1985). Rock ovens and
hearths were continuously used as a means to prepare food, and bison once again became
available. Ritualized mortuary practice became more common during the Late Archaic, with
interments becoming more complex and containing elaborate burial goods. Large cemeteries
were established along drainages, suggesting the importance of the location, and also perhaps
territorial ties to these localities (Story 1985). Location of these cemeteries “are believed to be
the result of the same cultural group using a place on the landscape to reaffirm their rights of
descent and control/access to critical resources” (Osburn 2007:15; see Taylor 1998 and Taylor
et al. 1995:627–631).

2.1.4 Late Prehistoric Period
Of the prehistoric stages, the Late Prehistoric stage is the best defined, marked by the presence
of the bow and arrow and by the production of small arrow points (Hester 1981:122). The
emergence of agriculture and ceramics also occurred in the Late Prehistoric. While incipient
agricultural and ceramic use is evident in South Texas, most researchers believe that these
technologies diffused into South Texas from other regions (Bousman et al. 1990), and that in
Central Texas these traits were added much later (Collins 2004). Ample evidence indicates that
people exploited a wide range of animal and plant resources for their diets. Food processing
techniques relied heavily on manos, metates, and earth ovens for cooking. Diagnostic artifacts
of this period include Scallorn, Edwards, and Perdiz arrow points. Sites tend to be more closely
clustered around creeks, rather than dispersed along other landforms, suggesting intensifying
nucleation around reliable natural resources.

2.1.5 Historic Period
The Historic period in Texas can be divided into two sub-periods: the Protohistoric and Historic.
The Protohistoric (ca. AD 1528–1700) is marked by the venture into South and Southeast
Texas by Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca in 1528. Archaeological sites dated to this subperiod contain a mix of both European (e.g., metal and glass arrow points, trade beads, and
wheel-made or glazed ceramics) and traditional Native American artifacts (e.g., manufactured
stone tools). However, the effect the Spanish presence in Mexico had on Indians in Texas
prior to about 1700 is not well understood. What is known is that the initial arrival of Spanish
missionaries and explorers spread severe disease that killed, displaced, and fragmented a huge
percentage of the population. As colonization spread from Mexico, many of the Coahuiltecan
groups moved northward to avoid the Spanish. At the same time, invading Native American
groups from the north put pressure on Native American groups in North Texas (Nickels et
al. 1997). Historians believe that these pressures led to intense territorial disputes, further

destabilizing Native American populations. The establishment of the first Spanish missions
and the expansion of the Spanish Colonial Empire mark the Historic period (ca. 1700–present).
The earliest known historic occupants of Bell and Coryell counties were the Tonkawa Lipan
Apaches, Wacos, Anadarkos, Kiowas, and the Comanches. Anglo settlement of Bell and
Coryell Counties first occurred in 1834 and 1835. Early settlement was centered on creeks
and rivers (Conner and Odintz 2009; Smyrl 2009). To combat Native American incursions, the
United States Army began establishing forts near frontier settlements. Two forts, one near the
confluence of the Little and Lampassas rivers and the other, Ft. Gates in Coryell County, helped
quell the Native American raids. By the 1840s, nearly all native groups had been decimated
by European diseases and driven away by aggressive white settlement practices. However,
isolated Comanche raiding parties continued to strike until 1870 (Conner and Odintz 2009;
Smyrl 2009).
It was not until after peace treaties were signed with the Native Americans in 1843–1844 that
white settlers began returning to Bell and Coryell counties. Most of the settlers flowing into the
area at this time had come from either older Texas counties, or from the southern United States
(Conner and Odintz 2009). Unlike antebellum East Texas, Bell and Coryell counties never
played a major role in the plantation economy. Smaller-scale farming predominated until the
beginning of the American Civil War (Conner and Odintz 2009; Smyrl 2009).
Historic documents indicate a minority of Bell County residents supported the Union while
Texans were debating to secede. However, once the vote for secession passed, Union-supporting
residents quickly switched loyalties and supported the Confederacy for the duration of the
war (Conner and Odintz 2009). The residents of Coryell County were decidedly in favor of
secession, and voted to leave the union in January 1861. Civilians of both Bell and Coryell
counties established various rural industries to provide shoes, saddles, and other war materials
for the Confederate war effort. Although the Civil War may have provided growth for rural
industries, passionate, and often violent, post-war political factions crippled governmental
operations up to the mid-1870s (Conner and Odintz 2009; Smyrl 2009).
Despite the volatile social and governmental situation, the local economy quickly recovered,
aided by the burgeoning cattle and sheep industries. These new opportunities in ranching and
farming attracted numerous immigrants, from both within and outside of Texas, to Bell and
Coryell counties. The population of Bell and Coryell counties experienced booms between
1860 and 1870, and then doubled again in 1880 (Conner and Odintz 2009; Smyrl 2009). After
1870, the population growth, coupled with a widespread shift towards cotton farming, began
to place pressure on country farmers. The agriculturally based economy of the area steadily
declined into the mid-1920s. The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and boll
weevil infestations hamstrung the cotton industry. The problems continued to grow worse into
the Great Depression (Conner and Odintz 2009; Smyrl 2009).
Like the majority of America, both World Wars had major impacts on economic growth. The
most prominent and important change to rural communities across Bell and Coryell counties
occurred after World War II. Residents greatly benefited from the construction of new military

facilities (e.g., Fort Hood, the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant, and a German prisoner of war
camp). Since its establishment, the military facilities have proven to be an economic boon to
local economy, spurring the expansion of urbanization and industrialization during the later
part of the twentieth century. Today, a third of the Bell County’s inhabitants are military or
military-employed personnel (Conner and Odintz 2009; Smyrl 2009).

2.2	Previous Investigations
The project area is located in the Central Texas Archaeological Region, along the Leon
River, in the central portion of the Brazos River basin. There has been an abundant amount
of archaeological work done within and around the project area, much of which is presented
in various archaeological reports (Directorate of Public Works Environmental Management
Office 1981; Jelks et al. 1962; Johnson et al. 1962; Miller and Jelks 1952; Prewitt 1974; Shafer
et. al. 1964; Shafer 1963; Shum 1955, 1957, and 1959; Young 1988).
The earliest archaeological work performed in the area was conducted by A. T. Jackson in 1933
and H. Ramseur in the 1930s. Jackson’s work consisted of excavations at the Wilson Farm in
eastern Bell County; however, the work was never reported (Young 1988). Ramseur excavated
the Ranney Creek Cave Site in eastern Coryell County, and like Jackson, his work was also not
reported (Prewitt 1974).
Perhaps the earliest work to be reported was conducted in the mid-1930s by Frank Watt, an
avocational archaeologist who served as the president of the Central Texas Archaeological
Society, and who was responsible for authoring and editing a majority of the society’s
publications (Lawrence and Redder 1985). One of his most significant excavations in the area
was in eastern Bell County in 1936, at 41BL28, the Aycock Rockshelter, (also known as the
Kell Branch Shelter No. 1). During his investigations of the site, Watt excavated a total of 32
burials from the shelter. In addition to recording 41BL28, Watt identified a total of 17 other
associated midden/camp areas along Kell Creek, which were subsequently revisited by Shafer
in 1965 during the Texas Archeological Salvage Project, during which each associated midden/
camp was given a site trinomial (Lawrence and Redder 1985).
Other investigations within our project area were reservoir projects conducted during the
National Park Service River Basin Survey in 1949 at Belton Lake, and the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project in 1962 at Belton Lake and Stillhouse Hollow Lake (Trierweiler 1996). The
most intensive amount of research conducted in the area is attributed to the ongoing Cultural
Resources Management Program at Fort Hood, in which 2,249 sites have thus far been
documented (Fort Hood Archaeologist Richard S. Jones, personal communication 2010).

2.3	Previously Recorded Sites
A map and records search was conducted at the archives of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the THC Archeological
Sites Atlas online database on December 15–18, 2009. This research focused on identifying

previously recorded archaeological sites within the project area and within one mile of the
project area.

2.3.1 Sites within the Project Area
The map and records searches determined that 58 previously recorded sites are located within
the project area (Table 2-1). Most of these sites are prehistoric and consist of a variety of site
types, including 22 burned rock midden and/or “midden” sites, 15 rockshelters, six “open
campsites,” four lithic procurement and/or “quarry” sites, three “lithic scatters,” one “food
processing” site, one historic dam, and several unknown site types. Two sites reportedly contain
human burials (41BL28, 41BL129).

The previously recorded sites were documented as early as 1936 (41BL28) and as late as
2001 (41BL1153). Fully one-half of the sites (n = 29) were recorded prior to 1979. As a result,
key data are missing on many of the site records. For example, 35 of the site records lack
information on site size, and 18 of the records lack information on landscape and/or setting.
All of the previously known sites were recorded prior to GPS technology and may or may

not have accurate locational information. Finally, fully 45 of the 56 prehistoric sites lack any
information on temporal association.

2.3.2 Sites within One Mile of the Project Area
The TARL and THC searches determined that more than 170 previously recorded archaeological
sites are located within one mile (1,600 m) of the project area. These sites consist of numerous
rockshelters, prehistoric lithic scatters, lithic procurement areas, quarries, burned rock middens,
and open campsites. Recordation of these sites occurred during the several archaeological
projects that occurred within the 1940s during the National Park Services River Basin Survey,
in the 1960s with the Kell Branch Survey and Texas Archeological Salvage Project, and the
ongoing Cultural Resources Management Program at Fort Hood.

Chapter 3

Methods
The archaeological field inventory for 18 of the 19 survey segments was conducted from
January 4 through March 5, 2010. Due to access issues, survey of the Horseshoe Bend segment
was postponed until May 24–28, 2010. Methods and density of shovel testing complied with, or
exceeded, the minimum requirements for field tactics stipulated by the USACE for archaeological
inventories in Texas. Prior to field investigations, EComm archaeologists conducted a review
of records maintained by the THC, noting all previously recorded archaeological sites within
the APE and within a one-mile (1,600 m) radius of the APE. In addition, USDA soil survey
maps for Bell and Coryell counties were consulted to assess the potential for deeply buried
deposits.

3.1	Survey Methods
3.1.1

Inventory

For each survey segment, a logistical plan was prepared in advance; GIS plots recommended
survey transects and identified the minimum number of shovel tests per transect to obtain the
coverage goal. Each field archaeologist was assigned a transect line and a targeted number of
shovel tests. Transect lines were designated with an alphanumeric prefix and individual shovel
tests along each transect line were numbered (Figure 3-1). In general, each crewmember
followed his/her own transect, walking in parallel with the other crewmembers. Occasionally,
for logistical reasons, two crewmembers doubled up, one person digging the shovel tests and the
other screening and recording
the field forms, or two crew
members would sometimes
“leapfrog” along one transect,
each digging alternating
shovel tests (Figure 3-2).
While approximately even
coverage was attempted,
surveyors deviated from
transect alignments in order
to test high-probability
locations
and/or
oddly
shaped sections of the survey
area. Tests were selectively
placed on landforms shown
by previous research to be

such as ridgelines, knolls,

rockshelters, and promontories. Areas
of obvious deep disturbance, such as
bulldozing, were noted on the field maps
and were excluded from shovel testing.
Similarly, areas along steep slopes and
areas that were completely inundated,
including low swampy areas, ponds, and all
areas underneath current lake levels, were
excluded from transect coverage.

Figure 3-2. Crew members
excavating a shovel test.

In addition to pedestrian survey, a boat survey
along the shoreline was also conducted
(Figure 3-3). Originally, it was anticipated
that the boat survey would primarily serve
to reach areas that were not accessible by
land. However, some of the survey segments
contained narrow strips of steep slopes
along the lake shoreline, and within these
areas, foot traverse proved to be difficult and
dangerous. As a consequence, the boat was
used to troll along the shoreline in search
of ridgetops, terraces, rockshelters, or any
areas where foot traverse and
shovel testing was feasible.

Figure 3-3. Crew loading boat after shoreline survey.

Recent debris, such as
aluminum cans, beer bottles,
and plastic detritus, were
commonly observed within
low-lying areas, drainage
inlets, or thickly vegetated
areas. In addition, many areas
adjacent to private property
that are on steep slopes
have been used as dumping
grounds for trash ranging
from bottles to household
appliances. However, no
further attention was paid
to such items unless clearly
older than 50 years old.

Special effort was made to relocate the previously recorded sites within the segments. For
these sites, the field crew used multiple lines of evidence to ascertain the location, or suspected
location, of the site. The crew referred to the site’s plot on the USGS topographic maps at
42

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

TARL, to the original site sketch map (when on file at TARL), and to the UTM (or latitude/
longitude) coordinates of the site. Allowances were made for possible conversion errors in
coordinate systems, and for possible map plotting errors. At each suspected location(s), the
crew conducted a pedestrian inspection of the vicinity. If no surface evidence of the site was
seen, the crew shovel tested the most probable location(s) based on the above lines of evidence.

north, incorporating approximately 56 acres of USACE property. According to Fort Hood
Archaeologist Richard S. Jones (personal communication 2010), that area contains three
fences: an original Fort Hood boundary at the base of the Owl Creek Mountains, which
matches up to the projected boundary lines provided by the USACE, and two subsequently
established fencelines closer to Owl Creek, denoting property maintained by Fort Hood. Due
to the uncertainty of ownership within these two segments, EComm’s archaeologists respected
the fencelines in these two areas.

3.1.3

Shovel Testing

The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum, one shovel
test was to be excavated per three acres (equivalent to 0.33 tests per acre). Using this rate of
coverage, a minimum of 2,065 shovel tests was required to inventory the 6,195 acres (Table
3-3). This calculation was based on the GIS shape files of the project area that were provided
by the USACE. This acreage included terrain that consisted entirely of steep slopes, areas that
were underwater, and areas that were prone to flooding during heavy rains. Because shovel
testing was not feasible on the steep slopes, the acreage of the project area was recalculated,
excluding some 1,045 acres of steep slopes. This calculation yielded 5,150 acres where shovel
testing was feasible. Archaeologists still conducted a visual inspection of all areas either
by pedestrian or boat survey. Using a rate of one shovel test per three acres, a minimum of
1,710 shovel tests was required inventory the 5,150 acres. For the project as a whole, net

coverage of all acreage was 0.37 tests per acre and was 0.45 shovel tests per surveyable acre
(excluding the steep slopes). Appendix A provides maps of all transect shovel test locations by
segment, and the data from all 2,320 shovel tests are presented in Appendix B.
At all shovel tests, GPS readings were taken to verify transect and shovel test locations. All
shovel tests were 30–35 centimeters (cm) in diameter and were dug to the bottom of the
Holocene deposits as indicated by clay or limestone bedrock, or to 80 cm below surface (cmbs)
if no clay or bedrock was present. Shovel tests were individually recorded with regard to
depth, soil type and color, and cultural material present. All shovel tests were dug in natural
stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness, and all excavated material was screened
through ¼-inch (6.4 mm) stainless steel mesh.
All cultural material was collected with the exception of recent objects such as bottle glass
shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to indicate recent disturbance and
were not collected.

3.1.4

Site Recordation

Each positive shovel test was further investigated by additional shovel tests in the immediate
vicinity, at a minimum interval of 5 m and a maximum interval of 40 m, depending on the size
of the site. At least six additional shovel tests were placed around a positive shovel test; in
some cases up to 15 additional shovel tests were required to fully delineate a site. If more than
one of these shovel tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single
test, then the location was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an
isolated occurrence. The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected,
but these were not further recorded. The locations on record of previously recorded sites were
similarly investigated using multiple shovel tests.
An exception to the shovel testing protocol was made at two locations along the property
boundary of the northern fenceline at the western portion of the Owl Creek segment. In these
instances, additional positive tests were not possible due to property boundaries and the size of
the landform. Both of these positive tests were located in areas that measured approximately 5
x 3 m on a small finger ridge, bounded by the property boundary and a sheer drop over looking
Owl Creek. Due to the small area that was accessible, no other shovel tests were excavated and
the cultural material recovered from those shovel tests were classified as isolated occurrences.
At both locations, we presume that any site would be located mostly on private property.
On each site, a permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch iron bar fixed with an
aluminum survey tag. On newly discovered sites, the tags were stamped with “ECOMM,” the
temporary Field Site (FS) number, and the date recorded. On previously recorded sites, the
tag was marked using the existing trinomial designations. If the coordinates of a previously
recorded site were visited, but the existence of the site could not be verified at that location, no
new datum was established.

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify
zones of zero or low artifact presence. Due to different characteristics of site settings such as
shallow soils, topography, USACE boundaries, and density of surface scatter, site boundaries
were not solely determined on the distribution of negative shovel tests. All factors were
considered when establishing a site boundary. In some cases, site boundaries were marked in
the field with pink-glow flagging tape and GPS mapped. In other cases, site boundaries were
later delineated using GIS positional data of positive shovel tests. Sites were photographed
and mapped using a Trimble GeoXT sub-meter GPS and were recorded using State of Texas
site forms. All excavated artifacts were recovered and processed and analyzed by the authors
in EComm’s Austin laboratory. All artifacts, notes, and records will be curated at TARL upon
completion of analysis.
On a very few sites—typically upland landforms characterized by dense assemblages of
surface artifacts—controlled 5-m diameter dogleash (DL) units were surface collected. Data
generated from DL inventories can be useful in determining a site’s surface artifact assemblage
and density, in addition to possible spatial relationships (i.e., activity areas within sites).

3.2

Archival Research

Archival research was conducted on sites whose archaeological evidence dated to the historic
period. The purpose was to identify historically notable persons possibly associated with each
site. Initial archival research was carried out by examining the primary sources in the deed,
land title, and probate records in Bell County. The landowners, their heirs, assigns, and grantees
were identified and their presence in the area during the period of interest was verified through
US Census data.
The identified persons were then further researched for historic significance. Individuals of
historic significance were defined as those who have merited an individual listing in The
Handbook of Texas Online published by the Texas State Historical association and the General
Libraries of the University of Texas at Austin. If a person of historical significance was in
any way associated with the properties, capsule biography information was compiled and
the nature of the person’s relationship with the area and the tracts was further researched to
determine the level of the person’s involvement. Persons residing on a piece of property and/or
actively participating in its development were determined to be significantly associated with the
property. Persons owning a piece of property but not residing there nor actively participating
in its development (e.g., absentee owners) were determined not to be significantly associated
with the property.

3.3	Evaluation of Significance
The NHPA of 1966, as amended, [16 USC 470 et seq.] created the NRHP to preserve and protect
important aspects of our nation’s cultural heritage. Among other actions, the NHPA directs
federal agencies to assume responsibility for the preservation of historic properties located
on their land or controlled by them, and further stipulates that such agencies must take into
Ecological Communications Corporation

47

Chapter 3

account the effects of their actions on cultural resources. Pursuant to this direction, agencies
are required to locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all properties
owned or under their control that appear to qualify for nomination to the NRHP. Eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP is restricted to properties that are significant and possess integrity as
defined in 36 CFR §60.4:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering and
culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association (36 CFR §60.4).
Significance is further defined in four criteria. Cultural resources are considered significant if:
A) they are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
B) they are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C) they embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method
of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
component may lack individual distinction; or
D) they have yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory
or history (36 CFR §60.4).
Cultural resources may qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under any of the four evaluation
criteria. In this study, prehistoric sites were evaluated for significance only with respect to
Criterion D. The demonstrated data content of each site was compared to important research
questions for Central Texas (Ellis et al. 1994). Sites in good condition and state of preservation
and having several data types bearing on one or more of the research contexts were evaluated
as significant under Criterion D. Those sites that were observed to be in poor condition or state
of preservation and/or sites with no data types bearing on one or more of the research contexts
were evaluated as not significant. Finally, sites whose expression could not be satisfactorily
investigated using the survey level tactics employed by this study were classified as of unknown
significance.
Historic sites, in addition to being evaluated under Criterion D as described above, were
also evaluated with respect to Criterion B. Because none of the historic sites retained any
architectural elements, Criterion C was not applicable. Similarly, none of the sites are associated
with important historical events, and so Criterion A was not applicable.

3.4	Laboratory Procedures
Artifacts recovered during the survey and excavations were processed at the EComm laboratory.
Artifacts and project materials were prepared for storage in accordance with Federal Regulation
36 CFR Part 79, and in accordance with current artifact curation standards established by
TARL. All artifacts were washed, labeled, and inventoried before being sent to TARL for
curation along with all records and photographs.

Results

4.1	Horseshoe Bend
Totaling 1,156 acres, the Horseshoe Bend survey segment was investigated using 389 shovel
tests. Seventy-two acres consisted of steep slopes, for a total of 1,084 surveyable acres, resulting
in a sampling density of 0.36 tests per acre. Of the 389 shovel tests, 41 were positive, returning
a rate of 10.5 percent ubiquity. Nine sites were encountered within the Horseshoe Bend survey
segment. Two of these were previously recorded, while the remaining seven have been newly
documented. Previously recorded site 41CV19 could not be verified. Of the remaining eight
sites, seven are classified as unknown prehistoric due to an overall lack of diagnostic artifacts;
the final site is classified as unknown prehistoric and historic-period affiliation. Detailed results
of each site are presented below in numerical order.

Site 41CV18 was first
recorded by Stephenson in
1949 during the National
Park Service (NPS) River
Basin Survey. The site was
described as an occupational
area. No other information
was provided; however the
site was subsequently visited
by Scurlock in 1962 during
the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project. During
Scurlock’s survey of the
area, the site was further
described as an open midden
site in open pastureland
that occupied ¼ of an acre.
Artifacts present during the
Texas Archeological Salvage
Project consisted of arrow
points, pottery, and bifaces.
Based on the cultural
material present, 41CV18
was considered to have a
Late Prehistoric cultural
affiliation.

41CV18 to reassess the
condition of the site and
its potential eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP.
During our investigation
of the site, data obtained
regarding the current site
condition was extremely
minute. Based on Scurlock’s
1962 environmental setting
observations, it appears
the heart of 41CV18 lies
outside USACE property
and in pastureland adjacent
to USACE property (Figure
4-1 and Figure 4-2). At
Figure 4-2. Overview of 41CV18 within USACE property.
41CV18’s location, the
USACE controls a roughly
35 x 80-m section of land that
contains the ephemeral edges of the site. Despite only having access to a small section of the
site, a 100 percent pedestrian survey was conducted accompanied with shovel tests.
Surface Assemblage
Due to secondary growth and leaf litter covering the site, surface visibility was poor. The
only areas where artifacts were observed were around limestone outcrops and areas where
vegetation was sparse. Artifacts observed on the surface consisted of flakes and angular debris.
Shovel Testing
In addition the visual inspection of the site’s surface, six shovel tests were excavated. Only one
shovel test was positive for cultural material.
Summary
In 1949, the site was originally recorded by R. L. Stephenson. However, due to the limited
information obtained by EComm, it is unclear exactly what archaeological material or features
Stephenson recorded. The majority of data pertaining to 41CV18 was produced in 1962
by Dan Scurlock. During this investigation, Scurlock documented at least one burned rock
midden associated with a prehistoric scatter of lithic debitage, tools, arrow points, and pottery.
Scurlock noted that the site resided within a meadow/open pastureland. Assumingly prior to
the 1962 survey, E. O. Miller conducted testing within a portion of 41CV18. However, no
documentation of this investigation was acquired during our background research, and it is
unclear if Miller’s efforts were scientifically based. The only indication of Miller’s testing was
a brief mention on the 1962 Scurlock site form.

Results

When EComm relocated 41CV18, little data was obtained regarding the current site condition.
Based on Scurlock’s 1962 environmental setting observations, it appears the heart of 41CV18
lies outside USACE property and within pastureland adjacent to USACE property. At 41CV18’s
location, the USACE controls a roughly 35 x 80-m section of land that contains ephemeral
edges of the site. During EComm’s revisit, only one of six shovel tests excavated was positive,
and only a few surficial artifacts were observed. Based on this data, it appears 41CV18 resides
within private property. Thus, site condition and cultural significance was not determined.

4.1.2

Site 41CV19

Similar to 41CV18, both Dan Scurlock and E. O. Miller contributed to early accounts of 41CV19
cultural composition. In 1962, Scurlock relocated 41CV19 using Miller as an informant. The
1962 site form states the site is located on a “big bend in the river” and within “an open field”
(Scurlock 1962a). Through this investigation, several unifaces, bifaces, and a Pedernales base
were recovered.
Unfortunately, the environment has undergone substantial alterations since 1962. During
Scurlock’s survey at Belton Lake, the lake had only been at normal pool level for roughly
7–8 years (US Army Corps of Engineers [USACE] 2007). Up to this point, it appears that
many areas surrounding the lake had retained some pre-lake environmental elements. Aerial
photographs taken in 1938 were provided to EComm by Fort Hood Archaeologist Richard S.
Jones. The setting of 41CV19 was described in 1962 as “an open field,” and the 1938 aerial
photographs show extensive agricultural activity.
When EComm revisited the site, older growth trees, dense shrub stands, and copious amounts
of deadfall dominated the floodplain. This in turn reflects the high amount of alteration this
portion of the Leon River has undergone since 1962. The flooding has also had profound
aggradational and degradational impacts throughout the floodplain containing 41CV19. Thus,
when EComm attempted to relocate the site, it was not encountered. The site is likely covered
by a thick deposit of recent alluvium that has been deposited during the post-dam flooding.
EComm excavated six shovel tests within the site’s location on record, but did not encounter
any cultural material. Shovel tests were not excavated past 40 cmbs due to the composition of
the thick, clayey soil. Due to the absence of cultural material, no datum was established.

4.1.3

Site 41CV1651

Site 41CV1651 is an 85 x 70-m prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age. The site is
situated within the crest of a gradually sloping terrace on a broad alluvial terrace (Figure 4-3).
Soils encountered at the site are Minwells fine sandy loam. The genetic composition of the
soil typically has approximately 2 m of fine sandy soil over a sterile clay; however, during the
delineation of the site, the sterile clay was encountered at depths ranging from 0 to 80+ cmbs.
This is most likely the result of extensive agricultural modification and plowing that transpired
here before Belton Lake Reservoir was inundated. Due to the agricultural modification and
maintenance, the integrity of the soil has been severely compromised. The disturbance is apparent

through the removal of sandy
deposits and the mixing of
surface and subsurface layers.
The deepest deposits exist
along the crest of the terrace
before it descends toward the
Leon River. Due to the soil
disturbance, there are several
different types of vegetation
present. The majority of the
site is covered in short rye
grass with thick clumps of
greenbrier and cedar. Surface
visibility is 30 percent.

Summary
41CV1651 is an 85 x 70-m prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age. Work conducted at
the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 12 shovel tests. Surface inspection
of the site discovered a moderately dense scatter of lithic debitage that has been impacted
by land modification during agricultural activities. Shovel testing revealed that an ephemeral
concentration of cultural material is present in the upper 40 cm of the site and is localized at
the crest of the land formation.

Site 41CV1652

Site 41CV1652 is a newly recorded, prehistoric site of undetermined age. The site is a lithic scatter
measuring approximately 200 x 200 m and is located on a broad upland terrace overlooking the
Leon River to the north and east (Figure 4-4). The site is bounded by the terrace edge to the
north and by private property to the south and west. The terrace is composed of soils from the
Topsey-Pidcoke association,
which create an ideal
setting for cedar, greenbrier,
mesquite, and tall grasses.

nine shovel tests (Table 4-3). Artifacts were encountered in the upper 40 cm and consisted of
24 flakes, five pieces of angular debris, and one core. Based on the amount of cultural material
encountered from the shovel tests, an ephemeral lens of cultural material exists within the
upper 40 cm. All shovel tests were terminated at a depth of 80 cmbs or when clay or bedrock
was encountered. Clay and bedrock was encountered at depths between 20 and 60 cmbs.
Summary
41CV1652 is a newly recorded, prehistoric site of undetermined age. The site is an open
campsite measuring approximately 200 x 200 m. Work conducted at the site consisted of a
pedestrian survey and excavation of 24 shovel tests. Surface inspection of the site revealed that
the majority of the artifacts are concentrated on the edge of the terrace, while an ephemeral
scatter was observed on top of the terrace. Shovel testing revealed that an ephemeral lens of
cultural material exists within the upper 40 cm.

4.1.5

Site 41CV1653

Site 41CV1653 is a newly recorded site located along a finger ridge that is bounded by private
property to the south and an unnamed creek to the north. The site is an open campsite and
measures approximately 120 x 55 m (Figure 4-5). The finger ridge is covered by grasses and
cedar. Visibility of the site’s surface is approximately 20 percent and is limited to exposed
grazing areas, game trails, and eroded areas. Soils encountered at the site are Lewisville silty
clays. Disturbances were observed along the creek and in the northern portion of the site. The
disturbance along the creek appears to be associated with the modification of the creek channel
to promote water flow. In the northern portion of the site, along the ridge edge, disturbance
consists of a cut along the ridge edge, possibly to create a terrace.
Surface Assemblage
Inspection of the surface documented two ephemeral artifact concentrations. One was in the
northwestern portion of the site, and the other at the southeastern section of the site near the
creek. No controlled surface inventories were conducted due to the paucity of artifacts at each
location. Artifacts observed on the surface consisted of bifaces, unifaces, flakes, and angular
debris.

Site 41CV1654

Site 41CV1654 is a 225 x 145-m prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age. The site is
situated atop a broad and very gradually sloping alluvial terrace composed of Minwells fine
sandy loam (Figure 4-6). The genetic composition of the soil typically has approximately 2 m of
fine sandy soil over sterile clay. However, sterile clay was encountered at depths ranging from
0 to 80+ cmbs. This is most likely the result of extensive agricultural modification and plowing
that transpired before Belton Lake Reservoir was inundated. Due to the soil disturbance, there
are several different types of vegetation present. The majority of the site is covered in short rye
grass with thick clumps of greenbrier and cedar. Surface visibility is approximately 30 percent.
Two distinctly different components define the site. A subsurface component is located in the
western half of the site, while the eastern half primarily consists of a large surface scatter. A
transitional zone having both surface and subsurface materials was noted between the two
components. For example, Shovel Test (ST) 67D-1.2 contained subsurface artifacts in direct
proximity to surface scatter.

Site 41BL1345

Site 41BL1345 is a multicomponent site measuring approximately 65 x 90 m (Figure 4-9).
Topographically, the site is located on a T-2 terrace of the Leon River. Based on topographic
maps and recently deposited flood debris, it appears the margins of the site closest to the river
are still periodically flooded by high water levels. Initial efforts in the field indicated that only
historic-period features were present within the site. However, during site delineation, a mixed
subsurface component containing both historic-period and prehistoric artifacts was discovered.
Both historic-period and prehistoric artifacts were encountered on the landform’s apex and
gradual slopes. During site delineation, the temporal placement of the non-prehistoric artifacts
was tentatively assigned to the historic-period. After a review of aerial photographs, provided
by Richard Jones from the Cultural Resource Management Office at Fort Hood, a historicperiod association was confirmed. The photographs illustrated that 41BL1345 is located along
an abandoned, overgrown, sand and gravel road that was used during the early to mid-1900s.

The setting at 41BL1345 is
an overstory of a mixture
of oak, cedar, hickory,
and hackberry trees. The
understory is moderately
open and consists of
assorted pastureland grasses,
greenbrier, and sapling
trees. Leaf litter and grasses
restricted surface visibility
to approximately 15 percent.
The soil is Bastsil fine sandy
loam, which is a Quaternary
loamy alluvium that is
derived from mixed sources.
The site was investigated
through pedestrian survey,
shovel test excavations, and
archival research.

While delineating the site,
three historic features were
observed. Two of these
features appear to represent
structural foundations, while
the third is a rock-lined
well. Based on similarity in
construction and proximity,

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

all three features appear to be
associated with each other.
Feature 1 is a rectangular
foundation
alignment
measuring about 36 x 15
ft (Figure 4-10). Based on
its alignment, the structure
appeared to contain a single
room. The superstructure
has been removed, likely
by the USACE, and would
have been anchored to the
foundation through machinegrooved rebar.
Like
Feature
1,
the
superstructure for Feature
2 has also been completely
removed (Figure 4-11).
The construction of Feature
2 consists of a 30 x 15-ft
rectangle with a 1-ft-high
foundation. Only the outer
wall is solid concrete; the
inner portion is composed
of limestone rock fill. This
foundation is capped by
a 4-inch-thick concrete
slab that is anchored to the
foundation using machinegrooved rebar. Based on the
distinctly contrasting layers
visible within the foundation
wall, it appears some form of
strap and board framing was
used during construction.

Figure 4-10. Feature 1 at 41BL1345.

Figure 4-11. Feature 2 at 41BL1345.

Feature 3 is a stone-lined well (Figure 4-12) that was probably improved in the mid-twentieth
century with a concrete collar that rises above the ground surface. The current opening measures
approximately 1.5 ft in diameter, rises approximately 2 ft above the ground’s surface, and is
made of concrete reinforced with machine-grooved rebar. However, the subsurface portion of
the well is entirely limestone covered with lichen, which implies an earlier construction date.
The well is 20 ft deep and is filled with dirt (and possibly some domestic debris) at its base.

Shovel Testing
In addition to the three
features and assortment
of surficial historic-period
artifacts, 12 shovel tests
were excavated to determine
subsurface
accumulations
and integrity (Table 4-7).
Of the 12 shovel tests, six
tested positive for prehistoric
and historic-period artifacts.
Three of the 12 shovel tests
indicate areas of disturbance
containing
mixed
and/
or reverse stratigraphy.
An Ensor dart point was
collected from ST 9 (Figure
4-13).

Figure 4-12. Feature 3 at 41BL1345.

Historic-period artifacts from this site include seven glass
shards from ST 2 that are likely the result of burned glass
from a fire. Two wire nails, one glass bead, two fragments
of whiteware from a plate, a brick, and two fragments of
clear bottle glass were also recovered from ST 2. One of
the glass fragments is a patinated rim fragment, perhaps
from a milk jar. ST 1 contained one very patinated
fragment of an aqua-colored, rectangular druggist bottle
with beveled corners, commonly manufactured between
1880 and 1920 (Lindsey 2010). There are no diagnostic
manufacturer’s marks on this artifact. ST 4 contained
two small patinated glass fragments: one of them is from
a jar with a threaded closure that is likely a canning

jar. One glass fragment was found in ST 8. A fragment of very patinated, brown bottle glass
was recovered from ST 9. Finally, investigators recovered one large rim fragment of a glazed
stoneware storage crock from the surface.
Of the artifacts that have any temporally diagnostic attributes, the wire nails almost certainly
post-date 1890 (Noel Hume 1991). The glass artifacts are all heavily patinated, suggesting
they have been buried for more than 80 years. The hexagonal, aqua glass panel bottle suggests
a pre-1920 date. The ceramic material has no temporally diagnostic attributes. Given this, it
is likely that the artifacts relate to the very late nineteenth century or early twentieth century.
Artifacts were found mostly from shovel tests placed around the well and the two concrete
foundation features, implying that they relate directly to the domestic occupation at the site.
Archival Research
Site 41BL1345 is part of the Peyton Bland Survey. It includes land in both Bell and Coryell
counties. In 1953, B. L. and Thelma Carlisle sold 135 acres to the United States government
(Table 4-8). The deed specified a number of structures that were on the property that the sellers
had the right to remove within a month of the sale. They included: a dwelling, a car shed, a
water supply system, a brooder house and chicken house, a wash house and smoke house, an
outhouse, a barn, a tenant house with its own water tank, and a hog shed. The two foundation
features observed during survey probably correspond to the house, tenant house, or garage.
This land was originally part of the Peyton Bland Survey. Bland’s heirs sold this parcel in 1881
to R. H. Smith, who lived in Orange County. Smith, in turn, sold the land to John J. Barefoot
in 1886. The Barefoot family appears to have resided in this area starting around 1880. Though
John Barefoot lived in Belton, there is a Duncan Barefoot and his wife listed in the 1880 census
for this general area, and based on ages (John was 57 in 1880 and Duncan 28), Duncan was
likely John’s son.

Results

In 1893, Barefoot sold two tracts of land to T. E. Shipp, one containing 153 acres, and the other
135 acres. The year 1893 corresponds to the year in which a major panic occurred in Bell and
Coryell counties, and many landowners who did not own their property outright were forced to
sell as a result of falling crop prices (Stabler 1999:17). The property’s new owners, the Shipp
family, did reside in Bell County. However, they likely did not live on the Barefoot tract (as it
was often referred to in deed records), but in another part of the county. In 1904, Shipp’s son
Ernest sold the land to George Cole. S. H. Berry bought the land from Cole in 1910. This is
perhaps Samuel Berry, son of W. G. and Caroline Berry. If this is the case, S. H. Berry would
have been 47 years old when he purchased the land. There is no census record of an S. H. Berry
in 1910, but there are records of the Berry family in Bell County as far back as 1870, when
Samuel Berry is listed on the census as a 7-year-old child. Mr. Berry sold the land to J. M.
Carlisle in 1913. Mr. Carlisle died in 1935, and is buried in the Buckhorn Cemetery next to his
wife, Docia, who died in 1954 (USGenWeb Archives 2006). Docia Carlisle continued to own
the land until 1946, when the heirs of J. M. Carlisle sold to B. L. Carlisle (son, Bruce, is listed
on the 1910 census). B. L. and his wife Thelma Carlisle presumably lived on the land until they
sold it to the government in 1953.
It is interesting to note that on the 1870 census, one Thomas Shipp is listed as a neighbor of
H. G. Carlisle in Belton. Another curious detail gleaned from deed records is a reference to a
graveyard located on the west side of the Grove to Moody Road. This graveyard is not marked
on any maps, and it is not clear where it is located. No graves were noted during the field
survey of 41BL1345.
The artifacts found at 41BL1345 most likely relate to the Carlisle family, who owned this
property starting in 1913, though it is possible that they could represent artifacts from the
Barefoot or Shipp periods of ownership. The burned glass likely represents part of a garbage
pit where trash was discarded and then burned, a common practice among rural families of the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Summary
The artifacts and features at this site relate to domestic occupations of the late nineteenth
through mid-twentieth centuries. The well was probably an artifact of the original Barefoot
period of use. However, it was rebuilt and updated through the addition of a concrete collar in
subsequent years. Except for the wire nails, which post-date 1900, the other artifacts found at
the site could reflect any time between the Barefoot and Carlisle periods of ownership. The wire
nails probably relate to site renovation that took place after 1900. The concrete foundations
also would relate to site renovation that probably took place after the Carlisle family purchased
this property in 1913.
The prehistoric component of this site consists of a thin surface and subsurface scatter of lithic
material with no associated features.

Site 41CV1656

Site 41CV1656 consists of a surficial lithic scatter of undetermined age, which extends
approximately 40 x 70 m across the apex of a prominent landform that is roughly 450 m west of
the Leon River (Figure 4-14). The landform encompassing 41CV1656 is only a small component
of the larger, extremely abrupt escarpment that follows the western floodplain of the Leon
River. The site also overlooks an unnamed drainage approximately 60 m to the south. Due to the
ridgeline topography present within the site, there are several large sections of exposed bedrock
at the margins of the site, following a steep drop in elevation. Where soils are present, they are
composed of a matrix Real-Rock outcrop complex, which are shallow mollisols approximately
10–20 cm thick. Due to the abrupt and steep nature of the ridges surrounding 41CV1656, no
artifacts were observed on the midslope of the landform. The vegetation is mostly cedar with a
few live oaks. The undergrowth is very open and contains little to no grass, few small shrubs, and
dense patches of leaf litter. Surface visibility is approximately 30 percent (Figure 4-15). Based
on the topographic setting, it
appears the majority of the
recorded site is deflated and
possibly located outside of
USACE property.
Surface Assemblage
The ephemeral nature of the
surficial lithic scatter required
no
controlled
surface
inventories to be conducted.

Shovel Testing
Due to topographical and
project area restrictions,
the survey crew was only
able to excavate six shovel
tests, none tested positive
for cultural material. This
is the result of the low
surficial density of artifacts
and the extremely shallow
soils. All six of the shovel
tests encountered bedrock
at depths between 10 and 20
cmbs.

Summary

Figure 4-15. Crew delineating 41CV1656.

41CV1656 consists of a
surface lithic scatter of
undetermined age that extends
approximately 40 x 70 m. All
six shovel tests excavated
within the observed limits
of the lithic scatter were
negative. The lack of positive
shovel tests is directly related
to the very low density of
lithic artifacts. Based on the
topographic setting, it appears
the majority of the recorded
site is deflated and possibly
located outside of USACE
property.

4.1.10 Isolated Occurrences
Four isolated occurrences were in the Horseshoe Bend survey segment. Each of these consisted
of a positive shovel test containing no more than two artifacts, with no other positive shovel
tests nearby. The coordinates of these isolated positive tests were logged but they were not
further investigated.

4.2	Iron Bridge
Totaling 314 acres, the Iron Bridge survey segment was investigated using 31 shovel tests.
Excluding 34 acres of steep slopes (>20%), 280 acres were surveyed for a net sampling
density of 0.11 test per acre. However, significant portions of the segment were underwater
along the shoreline of Belton Lake. Of the 31 tests, 11 were positive, returning a rate of 35.5
percent ubiquity. Three sites were encountered during the survey of the Iron Bridge parcel,
one previously recorded and two newly recorded. Due to the overall lack of diagnostic
artifacts observed, two sites are classified as unknown prehistoric, while one is classified as
unknown prehistoric and historic. Results of each site are presented below.

Site 41BL129 was first documented by Gibson and Shafer in 1963 during their attempt to
salvage a burial from further erosion. Gibson and Shafter described 41BL129 as a lithic
scatter with an associated burial that was located along an alluvial terrace of the Leon River.
The site was situated on the
west side of a small unnamed
intermittent stream within a
canyon surrounded by high
limestone terraces. The vegetal
setting of the site consisted of
thick patches of ragweed and
short grass, and a motte of
large oaks. Cultural material
observed during excavation
of the burial consisted of
snail shell, fire-cracked rock,
mussel shell, and lithic debris.
No diagnostic artifacts were
observed.

intermittent stream bordering the site, making it difficult to survey the portion of the site,
where a moderate lithic scatter was once reported. Only a portion of the low-lying terrace
originally described by Gibson and Shafer was accessible for survey due to the placement of
a private electrical fence and the high lake level. Despite the limited accessibility of the site,
archaeologists were able to examine a 90 x 55-m portion of the site.
Surface Assemblage
Inspection of the site consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey. Vegetation of the lowlying terrace was minimal and consisted of a motte of large oak trees, short grasses, ragweed,
and barren patches of sand. Visibility of the surface area was approximately 50 percent. The
surface assemblage of the site was minimal, consisting of an ephemeral scatter of flakes
observed on the patch of sand along the shoreline. No diagnostic artifacts were observed
during the survey.
Shovel Testing
In addition to a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area, six shovel tests were excavated,
two of which were positive for cultural material. One flake was found between 0 and 40
cmbs and one flake at 60–80 cmbs.
Summary
41BL129 was first documented by Gibson and Shafer in 1963 during an attempt to salvage
a burial from further destruction. Gibson and Shafter described 41BL129 as a lithic scatter
with an associated burial that is located along an alluvial terrace of the Leon River. The
site is situated on the west side of a small unnamed intermittent stream within a canyon
surrounded by high limestone terraces (Gibson and Shafer 1963).
Only a portion of the site was encountered due to flooding of the reservoir and private property
fencelines. Shovel testing was conducted along the top of the alluvial terrace and floodplain
just north of where the burial was encountered. No diagnostic artifacts were encountered
during our investigation, nor have they been reported during the original investigations;
therefore, 41BL129 is considered to have an unknown prehistoric cultural affiliation.

4.2.2

Site 41BL1338

Site 41BL1338 is a multicomponent surface and subsurface accumulation of historic-period
farmstead debris and prehistoric lithic debitage. The site is located atop a relic alluvial terrace
west of the Leon River (Figure 4-17). Historic debris observed on the surface includes several
sherds of clear glass, scrap metal, and a concrete trough. The terrace contains Bastsil fine
sandy loam underlain by a very distinct, sterile, and compact red clay. The terrace is very flat
with gradual slopes at the northern and eastern edges of the site.

During delineation of the site, 14 shovel tests were excavated, seven of which were positive
for cultural material (Table 4-9). Artifacts recovered consisted of 20 flakes, one piece of
angular debris, and one piece of porcelain. All but six of the artifacts came from the upper 20
cm. These artifacts were collected at 20–40 cmbs. The porcelain fragment has no decorative
elements or manufacturer’s stamp that could allow it to be dated. All shovel tests were
terminated at 80 cmbs, when clay or when bedrock was encountered.

Site 41BL1338 was sold to
the United States government
in January of 1954 by R.
C. Michalk (Table 4-10).
The deed specified that a
number of structures were
located on the property,
and that Michalk had the
right to remove these within
six months. The structures
included a dwelling with
a screened-in porch, three
chicken houses, two barns, a
garage, a feed house, several
sheds, a smokehouse, and

a hydraulic ram. There was
no evidence of any of these
structures at the time of survey. Michalk had owned this property since 1933, when he had
purchased it from E. M. Dean. It is not clear whether Michalk lived on this land, as he not listed
in the 1930 census for Texas, and subsequent census records are unavailable.
The family who owned and resided on the land before Michalk was the Joshua F. Kennedy
family. Joshua Kennedy purchased land from George Cole in 1914, apparently after George
T. Power had purchased it from Cole and defaulted on his loan. According to census records,
Kennedy did live on this property in 1920, which was near the Grove to Stampede Road (also
called the Grove to Moody Road). The road crossed the Leon River about 1,200 m up the
shoreline from 41BL1338 (Figure 4-19). In 1920, Joshua Kennedy was 31 years old, and lived
with his wife Charly (age 29) and their three children, ages seven, five, and two. A Samuel F.
Kennedy lived in a neighboring household, and this was presumably his father. Of note is that
Samuel Kennedy is also listed in the 1910 census as a neighbor of George Power, though the
1900 census does not list Joshua among the members of S. F. Kennedy’s household, which at
the time consisted only of the 63-year-old Samuel and his wife Virginia. Both Kennedy men
are listed as farmers.

During the period in which Kennedy owned this property, the land seems to have been heavily
encumbered with mortgages. Like George Power, Kennedy may have been unable to pay the
promissory notes on the land. There are a number of transactions related to this property listed
in the Bell County indices involving Kennedy and George Cole, and most are connected with
mortgages and promissory notes made for the purchase of this land. Complicating matters is
that the Kennedy land is tangled up with a number of other nearby properties owned at one
time by George Cole. Cole himself appears to have gotten into debt as well, and eventually was
bailed out by Eula Ware, the daughter of a long-time family friend who resided in Galveston
(BCDR 320/311). Ware eventually became the owner of the property in 1927, when she bought
it at auction for $1,000 in exchange for a $6,250 debt from Cole (BCDR 371/674).
During the first decade of the twentieth century, George Cole, a Salado-based businessman and
gentleman farmer, purchased a number of properties in Bell County, as evidenced by dozens of
deed records on file at the Belton County Clerk’s office. In particular he purchased a number
of adjacent tracts in the Peyton Bland Survey along the Leon River. Cole purchased the tract
containing 41BL1338 from Ernest Shipp in 1904, along with another parcel that contains site
41B1345 (BCDR 161/77). Ernest’s father, T. E. Shipp, purchased the same tracts from John

Barefoot in 1893 (BCDR 91/324). Though the Shipp family did reside in Bell County, they
likely did not live on the Barefoot tract (as it was often referred to in deed records), but in
another part of the county. The Barefoot family, in contrast, appears to have resided in this
area starting around 1880. Though John Barefoot resided in Belton, there is a Duncan Barefoot
and his wife listed in the 1880 census for this general area, and based on ages (John was 57 in
1880 and Duncan 28), Duncan was likely John’s son. Prior to the Barefoot occupation of the
property, this parcel was probably undeveloped, and owned by an investor from Orange County
named R. H. Smith, who had purchased most of the Bland headright, totaling 3137 acres,
from the heirs of Peyton Bland in 1881. Bland himself lived in Jefferson County following
his participation in the War of Texas Independence, and never occupied his property in Bell
County.
Summary
The only artifact relating to the historic period recovered from shovel tests, is a non-diagnostic
porcelain fragment. Observations on the surface noted clear glass and a concrete trough, which
most likely related to the Kennedy or Michalk period of occupation. Additionally, both historic
maps and aerial photographs suggest that farmsteads were located near this location during the

early twentieth century. Site 41BL1338 contains only limited evidence of these historic-period
land uses.
The prehistoric component at 41BL1338 was visible within delineation shovel testing. Twentyone non-diagnostic artifacts were recovered from five of the 14 shovel tests excavated, although
no surface or subsurface features were identified. This site is located on a wide alluvial terrace
overlooking the Leon River in an environment likely to contain prehistoric material, although
more recent agricultural activity has probably disturbed shallowly buried prehistoric materials.

4.3	Cowan
The Cowan survey segment totaled 260 acres, of which 64 acres consisted of steep slopes. The
remaining 194 acres were investigated using 99 shovel tests, for a sampling density of 0.51
tests per acre. Of these tests, 25 were positive, returning a rate of 25.0 percent ubiquity. Six sites
were encountered within the Cowan survey segment. Two had been previously recorded, while
the remaining four were newly discovered. Due to the overall lack of diagnostic artifacts, five
of the sites are affiliated with unknown prehistoric periods. The remaining site is of unknown
prehistoric and historic affiliation. Detailed results of each site are presented below, in site
number order.

Site 41BL44

Site 41BL44 was originally documented by Scurlock during the 1962 Texas Archeological
Salvage Project. The site was described as an open terrace site located on an old river terrace
that had been dissected by

gullies (Figure 4-22). During
the original investigations
of the site, numerous flakes,

has allowed thick vegetation dominated by stands of greenbrier and juniper trees with short,
mixed grasses that cover the sandy alluvial terrace. The erosion has created steep cutbanks and
transported soil from the western edge of the site into the lake. There is also a quarry on the
west edge of the site, which has undoubtedly removed and disturbed a portion of the site.
The most significant portions of the site reside on three landforms that are divided by the
previously described gullies. Two of these are located next to the shoreline within the far
northern portion of the site. These landforms contain very gravelly sandy soils, which contain
a medium-density subsurface accumulation of lithic debitage and flakes. The third landform
is located within the central and south-central portions of the site, and appears to contain the
most significant subsurface deposits. The third landform discussed is within the largest intact
portion of the alluvial terrace.
Surface Assemblage
During the revisit to 41BL44, EComm archaeologists reassessed the site’s level of preservation
through 100 percent pedestrian survey, during the survey a thorough inspection of the exposed
ground and cutbanks was conducted. The cultural material observed on the surface and within
the cutbanks consisted of numerous flakes, few bifaces, cores, and few unifacial tools. The
paucity surficial cultural material did not warrant a controlled surface inventory. No diagnostic
artifacts were observed on the surface or within the cutbanks. Based on cultural material
observed in the cutbanks it appears that the site contains deeply buried cultural material.
Shovel Testing
In addition to a 100 percent surface inspection of the site, archaeologists excavated 23 shovel
tests (Table 4-11). Shovel tests were first placed on transects. Positive shovel tests excavated on
transect were followed by additional shovel tests to assist in site delineation. Of the 23 shovel
tests excavated at the site, 12 were positive, yielding 53 flakes and one piece of fire-cracked
rock. The majority (94%) of cultural material from the shovel tests was found in the upper
20 cm of the site, while 4 percent was found at 20–40 cmbs, and only 2 percent was found at
40–60 cmbs. No diagnostic artifacts were encountered in the shovel tests. Excavations of the
shovel tests were terminated when clay, gravels, rock, or a depth of 80 cmbs was reached.

Summary
The original site form for 41BL44 notes that numerous flakes and tools were observed on the
surface and in the cutbanks. In addition to cultural material observed at the site, investigators
also cite dart points and “paleo-like” points collected from the site by the son of a nearby
landowner (Scurlock 1962b). Scurlock originally recorded 41BL44 in 1962 during the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project. During the original documentation of the site, investigators
recorded that the area has been dissected by numerous, deep gullies that feed into the lake.
During EComm’s revisit, archaeologists also observed artifacts on the surface and in the gullies;
however, no diagnostic artifacts were encountered, making it difficult to assign a temporal
designation other than unknown prehistoric. Due to the presence of dart points and “paleo-like”
points collected from the site, the site may have an undetermined Archaic cultural affiliation.
Currently, the area is not maintained, and water runoff from the escarpment to the east is
carving its way through the site, destroying a portion of it. Even with these disturbances, the far
north, central, and southern
portions of the site appear
moderately intact and contain
buried cultural material.

Site 41BL54

Site 41BL54 was first
recorded in 1962 by
Scurlock during the Texas
Archeological
Salvage
Project. The site was
described as a rockshelter
located at the top of a bluff.
The shelter measures 60 ft
long and 10 ft deep, with a
high sloping roof (Figures
4-23 and 4-24). During the
original investigation of the
shelter, investigators noted
that the site had been, and
was currently, exposed to
looting activity. Evidence
of the looting was observed
at the back of the shelter,
which was heavily potted.
At the time of their visit,
a looter had recently been
there destroying the site.

included a fragment of an

a complete human skull

addition to the presence of
human bone at the shelter,
investigators also observed
cultural material consisting
of snail shell, marine shell,
and lithic debris.

the condition of the site and
its potential eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP. The site was located at the top of a bluff surrounded by numerous cedar
and oak trees (see Figure 4-24). Small grasses growing along the slope of the bluff proceeded
into the rockshelter and covered the floor of the shelter. During the initial investigation of the
site in 1962, investigators noted that looter’s pits were limited to the back of the shelter, but
at the time of our investigations, the entire site was potted, indicating that looting activities
have been occurring at the site for several decades. Despite the extreme looting, archaeologists
proceeded to re-record the site.
Surface Assemblage
Examination of the site consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey. Archaeologists examined
the interior and exterior of the shelter and inspected the spoil piles of the looter’s pits inside
the shelter. The growth of the vegetation at the mouth of the shelter limited ground visibility
outside the shelter to approximately 30 percent, while visibility within the shelter was roughly
70 percent. Cultural material observed was mostly concentrated in the spoil piles inside the
shelter and consisted of numerous chipped stone debitage, marine shell, and snail shell. No
diagnostic artifacts were observed.
Shovel Testing
In addition to a 100 percent pedestrian survey, archaeologists excavated one shovel test. Due
to reports of human remains, the shovel test was excavated along the outer edge of the shelter
to reduce the chance of encountering human remains. The shovel test was excavated to a depth
of 40 cmbs before hitting bedrock. Cultural material collected from the shovel test consisted
of four mussel shells, six angular debris, and 10 flakes. All cultural material was encountered
from the upper 20 cmbs. Despite the amount of disturbance observed, small pockets of the
shelter’s deposits appear to be intact.

Summary
411BL54 was first recorded by Scurlock in 1962 during the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project. During the initial visit to the site, investigators noted evidence of looting, which at
the time had been limited to the back of the shelter. An unknown number of burials had been
disturbed and possibly removed during looting activities. Evidence of this was present at the
time with the observance of an excavated fragment of a skull and an unearthed skull mixed
with numerous lithic material in a looter sack.
In January of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited the site to examine the shelter. During
the revisit of 41BL54, cultural material was observed within the spoil piles of the looter’s pits;
however, no human bone was encountered or observed. This is likely due to the extreme amount
of disturbance through looting and the limit of our scope of work. Based on the overgrown grasses
on many of the looter’s pits, it appears that the looting has ceased within the last few years.
Although the single shovel test suggests the presence of intact deposits, the site is completely
disturbed from decades of
looting activities. It appears
that only approximately
5–10 percent of the shelter’s
floor remains intact.

Site 41BL1339

Site 41BL1339 is a 150 x 80-m prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age. The site is
located on a rocky ridgetop approximately 70 ft above the Leon River floodplain. The landform
continually slopes and has only an approximately 20-m-wide apex (Figure 4-27). Due to the
rocky nature of the ridge and the amount of slope in the landform, the soils are very shallow and
do not exceed 20 cmbs. Soils encountered at the site are of the Speck association and Real-Rock
outcrop complex. This ridgeline runs north–south, and overlooks the Leon River to the west
and a sandy alluvial terrace to the south. The vegetation is mostly juniper and cedar with a few

Spanish oak. The understory
is relatively open and is
composed only of leaf litter
that greatly reduced surface
visibility, approximately 20
percent. There appears to be
a small terrace on the western
and southern margins of the
landform where the surface
levels out before descending
to the floodplain and T-1
terrace. A two-track road
follows the terrace around
the landform before leading
down slope toward the T-1
terrace.

Site 41BL1342

Site 41BL1342 is a 130 x 15-m prehistoric procurement site of an undetermined age. The site
is located on a north–south running ridge that is constricted by the USACE property line to the
west and a clear break in topography to the east (Figure 4-28). The landform continues to rise
to the west out of USACE property. Since the erosional forces are widespread across the site,
large sections have shallow Real-Rock outcrop complex soils ranging from 0 to 10 cm thick.
Erosion is most apparent on the eastern edge of the site, where the topography descends into
the drainage. Along the edge of the landform, the sediment has eroded away and exposed large
limestone boulders and bedrock benches. The vegetation is mostly cedar with few live oaks. The
undergrowth is very open,
with little to no grass, few
shrubs, and occasional dense
patches of leaf litter. Surface
visibility is 40 percent.

Site
41BL1343
is
a
newly recorded site with
an unknown prehistoric
ephemeral lithic scatter
and an ephemeral historic
component as well. The
site is located on an alluvial
terrace overlooking Belton
Lake to the southwest, and
it measures approximately
100 x 90 m (Figures 4-29 and
4-30). The site is situated
along a sandy terrace and
floodplain and is bounded
by private property to the
northeast and by the lake to
the southwest. Vegetation
at the site consists of
mountain laurel, post oak,
cedar, grasses, greenbrier,
and bramble. The majority
of the vegetation is located
along the floodplain, making
visibility of the surface very
poor, approximately 15
percent. No artifacts were
observed on the surface.
Soils encountered at the
site consisted of moderately
eroded Menard soils and
Bastsil fine sandy loam soils.

Site 41BL1343 is located on the Aaron Ashworth
Survey, patented in 1847 as part of a first-class headright
league. The site lies within a 67-acre tract deeded to
the United States of America in 1956 by Pearl Carlisle
and her husband Calvin (Table 4-14). Other members
of the Carlisle family also owned property on the west
side of the Leon River (see history for site 41BL1345).
Pearl Carlisle had owned the land since 1937, when she
purchased 128.94 acres from J. W. Comer, N. J. Comer
Wise, and R. H. Comer (BCDR 464/23), none of whom
lived in the state. The deed transfer between the Comer
family and Carlisle indicated that the property was
situated along a road that led to a ford in the Leon River,
known as Winkler’s Crossing. It is likely that she lived

on this property, or nearby, since she is buried in the nearby Buckhorn Cemetery (Deaver
2008).
The Comer family must have inherited the land from their father, John Comer, who apparently
lived to be 95, and was also buried in the Buckhorn Cemetery in 1962. John Comer was a
merchant who owned a general store not far from this tract (see Figure 4-19) beginning around
1900. According the 1920 census he lived near the Stampede Settlement, along the Stampede
to Moody Road, probably lived near his store. In 1920, he was 42 years old and lived with his
wife, Tiney Adaline (1878–1925), and six children. Comer is listed in the United State Census
as a resident of this area from 1900 through 1930.
Comer acquired this property through four transactions ranging in date from 1900 to 1906. The
largest tract was acquired from A. R. Clay, who had bought it just a year before from longtime
residents, the Gent family. According to the 1880 and 1870 censuses, there were several Gent
households located in this general area. Not surprisingly, all were farming households. Deed
records indicate that William Gent purchased 83.8 acres from C. W. Moffat, of McLennnan
County, in 1856. There are no Gents listed in the United States Census for Bell County in 1860.
However, the deed in which the Gent family heirs sold the property to A. R. Wood specified

that the property was part of an estate that had been occupied by the family for almost 50 years
(BCDR G/95).
There are no structures depicted at the location of site 41BL1343 on the 1915 soils map, though
there is one structure along the Road to Winkler’s Crossing farther away from the Leon River.
The single sherd of whiteware found in a shovel test could relate to any of the three major
occupations (Gent, Comer, and Carlisle families) at the site, and is most likely a tableware
fragment that was discarded and then displaced though multiple plow episodes.
Summary
Site 41BL1343 is a newly recorded, ephemeral prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined
age with an extremely faint historic-period component. The site is located on an alluvial terrace
overlooking Belton Lake and measures approximately 100 x 90 m. Thirteen shovel tests were
excavated, yielding 14 artifacts from five shovel tests. Five flakes and one piece of whiteware
were recovered from the upper 20 cm, eight flakes were found at 20–40 cmbs, and a Darl dart
point was found at 40–60 cmbs There are no structures depicted at the location of 41BL1343

4.4	Winkler Park
Totaling 217 acres, the Winkler Park survey segment included 17 acres of steep slopes. The
remaining 200 acres received 164 shovel tests, for a sampling density of 0.82 tests per acre.
Of these tests, 22 were positive, returning a rate of 13.4 percent ubiquity. Four sites were
encountered within the Winkler Park segment. Of the four, three fall in the unknown prehistoric
period due to the overall lack of diagnostic artifacts, while the remaining site contained a
prehistoric and historic component, and falls under the unknown prehistoric and historic
period. Detailed results of the four sites are presented below.

boundaries. Only two were positive for cultural material, with one flake from the upper 20 cm
of the site and one flake encountered at 20–40 cmbs. It appears that the site contains a very lowdensity scatter of subsurface artifacts. The recovered artifacts may represent a single episode,
based on the amount and consistent depth the artifacts were recovered from. However, it is also
possible that this site represents runoff from upslope. For example, the landforms west of the
site were bisected when White Flint Road was constructed. Thus, artifacts once eroding down
the steep slopes may have been geographically altered and have since eroded to their current
location. Artifacts recovered exhibit very crude characteristics in material and production. The
artifacts are small and chunky in size, and contain a coarser grain.
Summary
41BL1301 is a newly recorded, prehistoric site of undetermined age measuring approximately
15 x 15 m. Work performed included a 100 percent pedestrian survey and excavation of eight
shovel tests on the site. Shovel testing revealed the site to have an ephemeral subsurface scatter.

4.4.2

Site 41BL1302

Site 41BL1302 is a newly recorded site consisting of an unknown prehistoric component and
a historic component. It measures approximately 200 x 65 m (see Figure 4-32). The site is
located on the toe slope of a prominent landform. The toe slope leads eastward into a lowland
T-2 terrace of the Leon River, which is now part of Belton Lake. The site has very low
stratigraphic integrity for several reasons including road construction, reverse stratigraphy,
and USACE wetland reclamation projects. The toe slope contains a variety of soils (Krum
silty clay and Real-Rock complex soils) ranging from very rocky to a fine silt loam. The rocky
soils are composed of small to large limestone rocks and cobbles, which are tightly compacted
to approximately 80 cmbs. The silty loam soil is relatively loose and generally void of any
limestone rock. The topography in the site varies from cleared floodplain to rocky hillside, with
mixed cedar and live oak. Leaf litter covers the ground in the densely treed areas. Due to the
heavy vegetation, surface visibility is approximately 10 percent.
Although the ground’s surface does not appear disturbed, shovel tests revealed signs of erosion
and reverse stratigraphy, which is probably the result of plowing and other modern activities.
Some portions within the southern section of the site appear to be more disturbed on the surface
due to dumping and scattering of modern electronic, mechanical, and food-related debris. The
original extent of the site is unknown, as recent construction of a retention pond and road
has modified to floodplain to the east, and completely removed over a meter of soil. Artifacts
observed in the cutbank of the retention pond included a small amount of fire-cracked rock and
lithic debitage. The site meanders around higher elevated areas on hills and stays within the toe
slope. Pockets of loosely packed silty loam were noticed during the site’s delineation.
Shovel Testing
In addition to pedestrian survey, 21 shovel tests (Table 4-15) were excavated in order to assess
the nature of the cultural deposits and site boundaries. Sixty-eight artifacts were recovered at

varying depths between 0 and 80 cmbs. The majority (66%) of the artifacts were collected from
the upper 20 cm of the site, while 29 percent was collected from 20 to 40 cmbs, and 5 percent
was collected from 60 to 80 cmbs. Termination of the shovel tests varied; 17 shovel tests were
excavated to 80–100 cmbs, and four encountered clay at 60 cmbs. Artifacts consisted of flakes,
angular debris, a uniface, some cores, pieces of brown glass, amber glass, clear glass, pressed
glass, whiteware, and unidentified metal fragments.
Artifacts from shovel tests relating to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries include four
fragments of undecorated whiteware, one fragment from a small whiteware plate or cup with
an embossed floral edge decoration, one rusted tin can fragment, a rusted metal wire fragment,
two fragments of clear bottle glass with embossed lettering (one with “…ul” and the other “…
ia”), one fragment of unembossed clear bottle glass, one fragment of aqua bottle glass, one
fragment of brown bottle glass, and one lip fragment of heavily patinated aqua bottle glass
bottle with a champagne finish lip. Based on thickness and the condition of the glass, this
last artifact may pre-date 1903, when the automatic bottle machine was patented (Leif 1965),
though only a fragment of the lip was recovered, and it is not possible to determine whether the
lip was machine made or applied by hand.
The other artifacts have a wide date range. The undecorated whiteware could range in age from
the 1850s to the 1950s. The clear glass fragments (both embossed and unembossed) probably
post-date World War II, when arsenic began to be used as a decolorizer (Lindsey 2010). The
metal artifacts are also largely undiagnostic with respect to date, though do not appear to date
any earlier than 1900. The metal wire has the appearance of a mattress spring, which would
certainly post-date the 1930s. The can fragment has no seam features and therefore could range

in age from the 1870s to 1950s. The brown bottle glass is probably a more modern artifact,
originating from a broken beer bottle.
Overall, there is nothing particularly diagnostic or unique about any of these artifacts. They
reflect general household debris relating to domestic occupations of the twentieth century.
Archival Research
According to information provided by the USACE, 41BL1302 is located on a 400-acre parcel
of the Aaron Ashworth survey, deeded to the US by Freda Richter et al. However, no deed from
Freda Richter (or any other member of the Richter family) in the Ashworth Survey could be
located in the Bell County clerk’s office. Consequently, the precise details of ownership and
land use are unknown. However, based on research for nearby tracts, it is possible to construct
a general picture of ownership and land use for this parcel.
This tract was originally part of 1600 acres sold to Charley Winkler in 1872, by Ernest Winkler
(BCDR R/74). The Winkler family was one of the earliest German families in this part of Bell
County, and occupied this area continuously up to the 1950s, when the US began purchasing
land for Belton Lake. A small settlement of other German families developed around the
Winkler homesteads between 1880 and 1920. The Richter family was among those associated
with this German settlement.
Charley Winkler and his brother William were the first to settle on this land. In 1880, Charley
was 35 years old and lived with his wife Catherine and three sons, William, Andrew, and
Charles. William Winkler, who lived in a nearby household, was 40 years old and lived with his
wife, five children, and his mother Mary. Census records indicate that their primary occupation
was farming, though they were also known to operate a cotton gin not far west of the Leon
River, along the road running from Moffat to Grove (BCDR 324/339, 175/156). The Winkler
name appears in census records for this area every year through 1930. Children of Charley,
William, and Ernest Winkler continued to reside on farmsteads in this general area and in
proximity to each other as they grew up. In 1920, for instance, the 43-year old Andrew Winkler
lived with his wife and three children along the Grove to Moffat Road running along the Leon
River (US Census 1920). August Richter (Freda’s father) was his neighbor along the Moffat to
Grove Road, and Andrew’s father Charles lived a little father to the north, also along the river.
A former ford of the Leon River was located a few hundred meters north of site 41BL1302.
This ford was called Winkler’s crossing, and led to the Stampede Settlement. Other Winkler
names appear in this same general area occupying farms west of the Leon River.
The 1916 Bell County soils map depicts several structures in the vicinity of 41BL1302. It
also depicts the ford in the Leon River, leading to Stampede Settlement. The 1936 County
Highway Map also depicted several dwellings and farms along the river near site 41BL1302.
The historic-period remains encountered at the site likely originate from these farmsteads,
which are probably associated with the Winkler or Richter families.

Summary
The historic-period archaeological materials collected from 41BL1302 reflect typical
domestic debris relating to the early to mid-twentieth century, and are most likely associated
with the Winkler family. However, given that no structures or features were noted at this
site, the debris is likely in secondary context, dispersed through plowing or other landscape
modifications. The disturbance that has affected the distribution of historic artifacts has
displaced the prehistoric component as well. A mixed subsurface stratigraphic context was
deemed present after excavation of 21 shovel tests. Prehistoric lithic artifacts were recovered
from above and below historic-period artifacts that post-date Native American occupation of
the region. This is likely due to displacement of artifacts during the construction of Winkler
Park Rd, which borders the site to the west. After the construction, prehistoric artifacts from
upslope have eroded downhill and covered the historic component.

4.4.3

Site 41BL1303

Site 41BL1303 is a 60 x 50-m
prehistoric procurement site
with an associated lithic
scatter of an undetermined
age. The site is located on
the midslope terrace of a
prominent hill overlooking
an
unnamed
drainage
approximately 50 m to the
south (Figure 4-33). The
landform is eroding south
and west into the drainage.
This erosion has stripped
some areas of soil, exposing
the
limestone
bedrock.
The exposed bedrock is
most noticeable along the
northernmost edge of the
site. Outside of the site, as the
landform continues to rise in
elevation, the percentage of
ground surface with exposed
bedrock increases. The
landform eventually passes
out of USACE property.
The erosion of the site is due
to natural colluvial forces.
However, the rate of erosion
may be increased due to

private property construction of concrete slabs and artificial terracing of the hill. Since the site
touches USACE property line, it is in very close proximity to the construction area, which may
have removed a portion of the site. Vegetation consists of mostly cedar with a few oaks, while
prickly pear cacti and leaf litter dominate the undergrowth. The sparse vegetation allowed for
approximately 20 percent surface visibility. Soils in the site are from the Real-Rock outcrop
complex and are located atop undulating bedrock. The bedrock varies from 0 to 50 cmbs across
the site. Deeper soils were noted on the western edge of the site closer to the drainage.
Large midslope terrace sites can contain very significant and intact cultural deposits; however,
41BL1303 is small and contains no sign of long-term occupation or utilization of the site.
Inhabitants were likely utilizing the topographic setting near a small intermittent drainage
to work down material gathered atop the landform, where chert nodules are eroding out of
the ground. Although the site likely developed in its current location, colluvial erosion from
upslope has likely increased the artifact density within the site. Thus, additional artifacts from
outside USACE property may have pooled within the east–west running terrace that wraps
around the midslope of the landform. Overall, the site is small and isolated to the discussed
terrace setting. No additional occupation areas were observed within the drainages. Although
no discernable stratigraphic layers were identified, there appear to be pockets of buried intact
deposits. Delineation of this site utilized topography, surface visibility, and positive shovel
tests to determine the site’s boundary.
Surface Assemblage
During the pedestrian survey, areas of exposed bedrock were carefully examined to see what
types of artifacts were present on the surface. Artifacts observed on the surface consisted of
numerous bifaces in various stages of reduction, some expediently utilized flakes, and several
bifacial manufacturing flakes and core reduction flakes.
Shovel Testing
In addition to a 100 percent examination of the site’s surface, nine shovel tests were excavated
(Table 4-16), with 16 artifacts found in two of the nine shovel tests. Bedrock rock was
encountered in six of the shovel tests at depths ranging from 20 to 60 cmbs, while two shovel

tests were excavated to 100 cmbs. Artifacts consisted of five flakes, eight pieces of angular
debris, one biface, one biface tool, and one core. The majority of artifacts were collected from
ST 21A-2.
Summary
41BL1303 is a 60 x 50-m prehistoric procurement site with an associated lithic scatter of an
undetermined age. Work performed included a 100 percent pedestrian survey and excavation
of nine shovel tests on the site. The presence of numerous bifaces, core reduction flakes, and
bifacial manufacturing flakes observed during the pedestrian survey affirmed the notion of the
site being a procurement. Shovel testing revealed that the site contained some deeply buried
cultural deposits between 20 and 60 cmbs.

4.4.4

Site 41BL1304

Site 41BL1304 is a 35 x 40-m prehistoric lithic procurement site with an associated artifact
scatter of undetermined age. The site is located on a broad landform in a small knoll where
chert is eroding out of the limestone bedrock (see Figure 4-33). The ground surface gradually
slopes to the east. Soils encountered at the site are from the Purves association and are silty
loam soils. They are gravelly and range from 30 to 50 cm thick above limestone bedrock. At
the eastern, northern, and southern margins of the site there are steep breaks in topography.
This is the result of two intermittent drainages that flow into Belton Lake and the termination
of the landform at the Belton Lake shoreline. Although a large portion of the vegetation
has been cleared in the recent past, pockets of still contain old-growth trees. Live oak trees
and mesquite with mixed grasses and leaf litter covering the ground surface dominated the
remaining vegetation, and allowed for a roughly 20 percent surface visibility.
The site consists of a low to moderate-density surface scatter with a low-density subsurface
accumulation of artifacts. Although some form of deflation and erosion has occurred, effects
appear less significant than observed at other procurement ridge sites. Like most other
procurement areas, it is unknown if the site represents one component or several due to the
nature of surface deposits and lack of diagnostic artifacts. The densest accumulation of artifacts
in the site stretches west from the lake’s shoreline approximately 40 m inland. Within this area,
artifacts are visible on the surface and present in subsurface deposits. Other, more peripheral
portions of the site do not yield high surface artifact densities and may only contain subsurface
artifacts. Topography was used to establish a boundary in every direction except to the west.
Surface Assemblage
One controlled surface inventory was conducted along an exposed area of the knoll that
contained moderate to high concentrations of surface artifacts. Artifacts within the surface
collection were located on top of exposed bedrock and therefore in a secondary palimpsest
context. Artifacts observed are consistent with artifacts typically associated with procurement
sites.

Shovel Testing
Seven shovel tests were excavated on the site, two of which were positive for cultural material.
Eight artifacts were collected from the two shovel tests and consisted of one core, five pieces
of angular debris, and two flakes. The majority of cultural material collected was encountered
between 0 and 20 cmbs. All shovel tests encountered bedrock at 20 and 60 cmbs.
Summary
41BL1304 is a prehistoric lithic procurement site with an associated artifact scatter of
undetermined age. Work performed at the site consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey,
a 5 x 5-m controlled surface inventory, and excavation of seven shovel tests. The majority of
artifacts observed at the site are located on heavily eroded soils on bedrock and are thus in a
secondary context. Shovel testing revealed the site to have few buried cultural materials to a
depth of 20 cmbs, and that the soils at the site are generally shallow, ranging in depth from 20
to 60 cmbs.

4.5	White Flint Park
Totaling 255 acres, the White Flint Park survey segment included 42 acres of steep slopes. The
remaining 213 acres received 156 shovel tests, for a sampling density of 0.73 tests per acre.
Of these tests, 37 were positive, returning a rate of 23.7 percent ubiquity. During the survey of
the White Flint Park segment, seven sites were encountered. Four were previously documented
sites and three are newly recorded. Two of the sites contained unknown prehistoric and historic
components. The other five sites fall within the unknown prehistoric period due to the overall
lack of diagnostic artifacts. Detailed results of the seven sites are presented below.

4.5.1

Site 41BL34

Site 41BL34 was originally documented by Scurlock during the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project in 1962. The site was recorded as an open campsite located on the summit of a hill
overlooking the Leon River
floodplain (Figure 4-34).

In 1984, the site was
revisited by Patterson, who
defined the site as a lithic
source and workshop area,
based on the presence of
naturally occurring chert and
a large scatter of lithic debris.
During these investigations,
Patterson identified four
distinct
activity
areas,
which he distinguished
alphabetically from A to D.

Area A was characterized as a lithic source area and workshop area measuring approximately
100 x 150-yards. Area B was a lithic source area and primary flint knapping area measuring
approximately 50 ft wide by several hundred feet long. Area C was a lithic workshop area that
measured approximately 100 ft wide by several hundred feet long. Area D was characterized as
a lithic workshop area measuring approximately 100 ft in diameter. Cultural material collected
an observed during the 1984 visit consisted of numerous chert flakes, complete and fragmented
bifaces, scrapers, and a “mousteroid point.” Although Patterson defined four activity areas, a
complete site boundary for the entire site was never defined.
In 2001, SWCA revisited 41BL34 prior to the construction of a park that has since been
established. During their revisit, locations previously identified by Patterson were relocated,
including another activity area denoted as Area E. Area E was defined by SWCA as a lithic
quarry scatter consisting of numerous tested cobbles and lithic debitage. The newly defined
area is located just north of Patterson’s Areas B and C. During their investigations at the site,
SWCA excavated a total of 40 shovel tests across the entire site and conducted a 100 percent
pedestrian survey. Cultural material encountered during their investigations consisted of
lithic debitage, tested chert cobbles, flakes, a small amount of burned rock and charcoal, few
possible hammerstones, six modified flakes, and one piece of flaked amethyst glass. Based on
their investigations of the site and the discovery of the new activity area, SWCA established a
boundary for the site that measures approximately 753 x 450 m. SWCA reported that the site
has low potential for research value due to recent disturbance observed.
Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL34 in January of 2010, to further investigate the
potential and condition of the site. During our visit to the site, a 100 percent pedestrian survey
was conducted that resulted in the relocation of the five areas identified in the two previous
investigations. Based on our investigations, the boundaries established by SWCA remained the
same. The site is located on two large terraces overlooking Belton Lake and is crosscut by two
drainages, one along the west northwestern portion of the site and the other at the northern end.
The site is predominately covered by juniper and greenbrier, with American beauty, live oak,
cactus, Golden rod and various other grasses.
Surface Assemblage
Surface visibility varied from approximately 45 to 90 percent across the site. Inspection of the
surface revealed large scatters of lithic material with higher concentrations in the defined areas.
Cultural material observed on the surface consisted of cores, bifaces, unifaces, numerous flakes,
and tested cobbles. No diagnostic materials were encountered during the surface inspection of
the site.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the 100 percent survey of the site, 21 shovel tests were excavated throughout
the site (Table 4-17), six of which contained 112 pieces of lithic material. The majority of the
artifacts (37 percent) were encountered at 20–40 cmbs, while 22 percent were at 0–20 cmbs, 26
percent at 40–60 cmbs, 6 percent at 60–80 cmbs, and 9 percent at 80–100 cmbs. All six positive

shovel tests were located in Area A of the site, which was composed of deep sandy soils. Soils
in Area A were very different from that in the surrounding area of 41BL34. Evidence of this
is seen in the 15 shovel tests in which bedrock and clays were encountered at depths ranging
from 20 to 80 cmbs.
Summary
Several individual efforts to record the cultural activity at 41BL34 have taken place since
1962. For the most part, the past records regarding 41BL34’s cultural material still apply today.
However, since the prior surveys were conducted, the park has been modified and expanded.
Thus, the cultural footprint in Areas A, B, C, D, and E have been nearly or completely removed.
Construction in Area A is the most extensive. The area has been bladed and trenched for further
park expansion. Thus, the cultural deposits in this locality have been greatly constricted. Within
Area A is an undisturbed knoll with deep sandy deposits unlike any other portion of 41BL34.
This area is located within the main loop of White Flint Park in its central and eastern sections.
Shovel testing at Area A revealed a dense subsurface scatter of tertiary flakes (including softhammer and thinning flakes) with a very low-density scatter of fire-cracked rock to at least 100
cmbs. This is also the location where a “mousteroid” point was recovered in 1962. However,
no tools or points were encountered during EComm’s 2010 survey. Area B is present, but
further disturbed. Area B originally represented an eroded band of artifacts from upslope.
Today, it is present, but even further disturbed by campsite construction upslope. Portions of
Area C remain, but the northern section of this locality is highly disturbed and contains no
cultural material. No cultural material was discovered in Area D, which is now the location
of campsites. Area E, located north of the park campsites, is an extension of the site recorded
by SWCA in 2001. This portion of the site appears the same as it was when recorded in 2001.

4.5.2

Site 41BL249

Site 41BL249 was originally recorded in 1981 during a survey of the area by Patterson. The
site was described as a quarry site located on the side of a ridge that extended to the bottom
of a draw at the base of the ridge. The size of the site was not fully determined during the
initial visit. Cultural material observed consisted of a scatter of flakes and cores. No diagnostic

Surface Assemblage
Inspection of the site area consisted of a survey along the steep slope and at the bottom of a
drainage. The majority of the artifacts appeared to be displaced due to erosion and seemed to
come from the top of the ridgeline, which is located on private property. Artifacts observed on
the surface consisted of flakes, cores, bifaces, and very few tools. No diagnostic artifacts were
observed during our survey of the site. In addition to the inspection of the surface, shovel tests
were also excavated.
Shovel Testing
Due to the location of the site, all shovel tests excavated were placed in the bottom toe slope
of the ridgeline, within a drainage area. Four shovel tests were excavated (Table 4-18), three of

which contained 16 flakes, one utilized
flake, and one edge-modified flake.
However, the soil deposits containing
the flakes are not considered intact, do
to the nature of the site. It is presumed
that the artifacts recovered from the
shovel tests originate from the top of
the ridge, which is located on private
property.

Summary
41BL249 was first recorded in 1981 during a survey conducted by Patterson. The site was
described as a quarry site located along the side of a steep slope that extended into a drainage
at the base of a large ridge. Cultural material observed during the initial visit consisted of a
scatter of flakes and cores.
The site was revisited in January of 2010 by EComm archaeologists to reassess the condition of
the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. During our visit, 41BL249 was
relocated in the area as described during the initial visit, along the side of a prominent ridgeline
that originates outside of our project area. Survey of the site consisted of a complete inspection
of the surface and included shovel testing. The surveyed portion of this site is extremely eroded
and represents only the ephemeral margins of the site, which is likely located at the crest of the
landform. The portion of 41BL249 that is within USACE property is not intact and contains no
significant data. Since only a sliver of the site was recorded during this survey, and the original
datum location could not be accessed, no new datum was established.
During the original investigation of the site, Patterson describes 41BL249 as a quarry site.
However, based on our observations it appears that the site is more of a large lithic scatter that
has been displaced from its original context due to erosion. All artifacts are located along a
steep slope of a ridge that originates on private property, suggesting that the actual site is also
located on private property.

4.5.3

Site 41BL250

Site 41BL250 was originally recorded in 1981 during a survey by Patterson. The site was
described as a quarry site located on the side of a ridge. The size of the site was not fully
determined during the initial visit, but cultural material observed at that time consisted of a
scatter of flakes, cores, a large prismatic blade, and a medium sized hammerstone. Patterson
further stated that there are several areas with concentrations of debitage from quarry
operations. No diagnostic artifacts were observed during Patterson’s visit; therefore, the site
has an unknown prehistoric cultural affiliation.
In January of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited the site to determine the current condition
and potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. At the time of our investigation, 41BL250

was relocated along the midslope setting of a prominent ridgeline that originates outside of
the project boundary (see Figure 4-35). The portion of 41BL250 that lies within the USACE
property is not intact and contains no significant data due to the location of the artifacts, which
are all located on a steep side slope. Since only a sliver of the site was recorded during this
survey and the original datum location could not be accessed, no new datum was established.
Although the site was located along the side of a steep slope, archaeologists inspected the area
by a 100 percent pedestrian survey and shovel tests.
Surface Assemblage
Inspection of the site area consisted of a survey along the midslope of the ridgeline. The
majority of the artifacts appear to be displaced due to erosion and seem to come from the top of
the ridgeline, which is located on private property. Artifacts observed on the surface consisted
of flakes, cores, bifaces, and very few tools. No diagnostic artifacts were observed during our
survey of the site. In addition to the inspection of the surface, shovel tests were also excavated.
Shovel Testing
Due to the location of the site, all shovel tests were excavated on the midslope of the ridgeline.
In total, five shovel tests were excavated within a rocky, clayey soil near the property line
closest to the site’s core. Only one test was positive, and contained lithic artifacts from 0 to 60
cmbs. Ten pieces of angular debris were recovered at 0–20 cmbs, four flakes and four pieces
of angular debris were found at 20–40 cmbs, and one flake and two pieces of angular debris
were at 40–60 cmbs. Although all 21 artifacts were encountered within one shovel test, it is
presumed that they originate from the top of the ridge, which is located on private property.
The artifacts are therefore considered to be out of context.

During EComm’s revisit, it was noted that the site boundary should be redrawn to cover a smaller
area, due to disturbance and lack of artifacts (Figure 4-36). The site’s main concentration is in
its northern and western quadrants. A lake inlet/drainage is a good eastern boundary (Figure
4-37). Only a small sliver extends further east next to White Flint Road. Full investigation of
the site consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey combined with shovel testing, and due to
the originally documented historic-period component, archival research was also conducted.
Surface Assemblage
During the surface inspection of the site, prehistoric activity was observed primarily on surface
near rocky outcrops. Artifacts on the surface include early- and middle-stage bifaces, core
tools, and multidirectional cores. Several clusters of historic-period debris were observed in
various areas of the site and consisted of early to mid–twentieth-century industrial machinery

the site. All shovel tests were terminated at 80 cmbs or when clay, bedrock, or the water table
was reached.
Archival Research
Site 41BL1154 comprises at least six separate tracts that were sold to the United States of
America between 1952 and 1953. It includes parcels sold to the US government by Johnnie
E. Richter (BCDR 684/384), Ida Lee Walker (deed not found), N. T. Parker (BCDR 677/630),
Mayme Miller (deed not found), John A. Winkler (BCDR 739/247), and Freda Richter (BCDR
684/386). The deed from both Johnnie and Freda Richter specify that dwellings and a number
of farm structures (barns, sheds, corn cribs, smokehouses, etc.) were present on the properties
at the time of sale. Complete deed histories for each of these parcels will not be presented for
this site, due in part to the incompleteness of the records at the Bell County Clerk’s office, and
also due to the fact that the historic component of this site is limited to mid–twentieth-century

household debris in secondary context. The artifacts and features observed at the site simply
do not warrant detailed land use histories on five separate tracts.
Nonetheless, a rough sketch of land use and occupation from the 1870s to the present day was
developed through deed research on several of the tracts comprising the largest portion of the
site. Namely, research conducted for the parcels owned by Johnnie and Freda Richter, John
A. Winkler, and N. T. Parker indicate that the Richter and Winkler families were long-time
residents of this area. They were part of a small German enclave that resided in the Moffat
area, on the west bank of the Leon River. This enclave included the Hohle, Lauschke, and Wald
families, among others.
The Winkler family was one of the earliest German families in this part of Bell County, arriving
1872, when Charles (Charley) E. Winkler purchased 1600 acres of land in the Aaron Ashworth
Survey from Ernest Winkler (who may have been a brother or father) in 1872 (BCDR R/74).
Charley (originally Carl) Winkler was a native of Prussia who came to Texas in 1859, settling
first in the Bastrop area (US Census 1870), then later in Bell County with his brother William.
In 1880, Charley was 35 years old and lived with his wife Catherine and three sons, William,
Andrew, and Charles. William Winkler, who lived in a nearby household, was 40 years old
and lived with his wife, five children, and his mother Mary. Between 1872 and the 1950s, the
Winkler family owned property along the west side of the Leon River continuously, operating
a cotton gin located not far west of the river along the road running from Moffat to Grove,
which ran along the river. The site of this gin is probably close to site 41BL1154. A ford in the
Leon River located farther upstream from 41BL1154 was referred to as Winkler’s Crossing.
A number of the children of both William and Charley continued to reside in this area as they
grew to maturity.
Members of the Richter family were also long-time residents of this area, though Johnnie and
Freda Richter, who sold adjacent parcels to the US government in 1953 for construction of
Belton Lake, owned those tracts for only 10 years prior to the sale (BCDR 500/336, 502/294).
Nonetheless, according to census records, the Richters were neighbors of the Winklers prior to
1910. August Richter, also a native of Germany, lived along what the 1920 census referred to
as the “River Road,” which was probably the same road that once ran from Moffat to Grove
along the Leon River. Johnnie and Freda were among his youngest children. Johnnie and Freda
Richter purchased the tracts they sold to the US Government from Elsie Walk Runnels, who
had inherited them from her father John Wald, who was also a native of Germany, and who
lived in this area from around 1910. He purchased the land from Herman Boriak and his wife
Lily, whose maiden name was Lauschke. Lily Lauschke’s father had bought the land through
two purchases: one in 1902 (BCDR 140/448) and one in 1906 (BCDR 176/156). The purchase
in 1906 came from J. E. Hohle and his wife Emma, also residents of this area, and also German
immigrants. When J. E. Hohle died in 1907, his wife Emma remarried J. O. Winkler.
Of note, many of the deed transactions (e.g., 342/339 500/336) for the Richter tracts mention
the southern boundary of the property as being the Coppin homestead tract, which later became
the tract that N. T. Parker sold to the US in 1952 (BCDR 677/630). The specific history for that
property is described in the site history for 41BL1309.

Generally speaking, however, the area that contains site 41BL1154 is part of a German
immigrant community that coalesced around the turn of the nineteenth century. Members of
the Winkler, Richter, Hohle, and Laushcke families are all buried in the St. Paul Lutheran
Cemetery, which is located just off SH 36 less than a mile west of this particular site (Deaver
2007). This community appears to have remained relatively cohesive well past the 1930s,
based on census records, and based on property ownership data provided by the USACE.

Site 41BL1305 is a large
lithic
scatter
measuring
370 x 65 m with an unknown
cultural affiliation. This site
encompasses a variety of
topographic settings due to
a continuous surface and
subsurface scatter of artifacts
(Figure 4-38). Topographic
settings within 41BL1305
includes hilltops, steep slopes,
and pooling areas. Atop the
landforms and on the steep
slopes, bedrock is very
shallow and commonly seen
at the surface and eroding
out of the hillside. Several

During EComm’s revisit, it was noted that the site boundary should be redrawn to cover a
smaller area, due to disturbance and lack of artifacts. The site’s main concentration is in its
northern and western quadrants. Of the 54 shovel tests excavated, only six were positive for
cultural material. The majority of artifacts were encountered within the upper 20 cm of the site
and consisted of lithic flakes and angular debris. A light scattering of prehistoric artifacts was
observed on the surface, primarily near rocky outcrops. These included early and middle-stage
bifaces, core tools, and multidirectional cores. Based on dates from the 1950s license plate and
on diagnostic attributes of cans
and bottles, the historic-period
41BL249
material was deposited around
or shortly after the creation of
Belton Lake, most likely by
workers clearing tracts of land
around the lake.

site. These level areas are
either near apexes or in toe
slope settings and contain
deeper soil deposits due
to colluvial erosion and
pooling of sediment. The
vegetation is mostly cedar

approximately 30 percent
due to dense leaf litter.
Soils encountered at the
site are from the Real-Rock outcrop complex, Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex, and Eckrant
cobbly silty clay. Due to the extreme erosion that has taken place, the site extends roughly 40 ft
in elevation up the landforms. Several factors have contributed to the current condition of this
site. For example, the steep slopes have facilitated the erosion of artifacts down the hillsides,
and the remnants of an old USACE park clearly bisected hills creating artificial pooling areas
and displacing a large expanse of the site’s surface scatter (Figure 4-39).
Surface Assemblage
One controlled surface inventory was conducted along an exposed area of the hillside that
contained moderate to high concentrations of surface artifacts. Artifacts within the surface
inventory were recorded on a steep slope and are therefore in a secondary context. Four biface,
one bifacial core, one bifacially edge-modified flake, seven edge-modified flakes, two primary
flakes, and one quarry blank were collected in the surface inventory. All materials were chert.
Shovel Testing
In addition to pedestrian survey, 19 shovel tests were excavated (Table 4-20) to assess the nature
of cultural resource deposition and site boundaries. Six were positive for cultural material. In
total, 74 artifacts were collected from the shovel tests; 43 were encountered in the upper 20
cm of the site, 14 were encountered at 20–40 cmbs, and 17 were encountered at 40–60 cmbs.
Termination of the shovel tests varied: five were excavated to 80 cmbs, four encountered clay
between 40 and 60 cmbs, and 10 were excavated to bedrock at depths between 20 and 60 cmbs.
Artifacts collected consisted of 34 flakes and 40 pieces of angular debris.

Site 41BL1307

Site 41BL1307 is a newly
recorded,
prehistoric
procurement/lithic
scatter
site of undetermined age
and measures approximately
530 x 300 m (Figure 4-40). The
site is located across hilltops,
steep slopes, and drainages.
Atop the landforms and on
the steep slopes, bedrock is
very shallow and commonly
seen at surface and eroding
out of the hillside. Several
more level areas were noted
during the delineation of the
site. These areas are either
near apexes or within toe
slope/drainage settings and
contain deeper soil deposits
due to colluvial erosion and
pooling of sediment. Soils
encountered within the site
are from the Eckrant-Rock
outcrop complex and the RealRock outcrop complex. Two
prominent landforms comprise

the majority of this site’s
topographic setting. These
two landforms are connected
by a broader upland plateau
that is cut off by the project
area boundary. Only the
peripheral finger ridges were
delineated and incorporated
into this site. Both landforms
share similar geological
characteristics. The apexes
are very rocky with exposed
bedrock and chert nodules
scattered across the ground
(Figure 4-41). The steep
slopes

exposed limestone benches.
Finally, toe slope/drainage
settings
have
minimal
exposed bedrock, and substantially deeper deposits. The vegetation is mostly cedar with
scattered sycamore and oak. A few patches of prickly pear are present at the apexes of the
landforms where it is extremely rocky. Although there is a predominately clear understory,
the ground’s surface visibility remains low (approximately 20 percent) due to dense leaf litter.
Surface Assemblage
Distribution of artifacts is relatively even across the slopes, with less concentrated accumulations
at apexes. Extensive colluvial erosion has removed artifacts from the once highly concentrated
apexes and dispersed them down slope. Artifacts observed on the surface are consistent with
procurement sites, but they were observed in areas where limestone was visible or along the
slope face. Cultural material observed consisted of numerous cores, flakes, bifaces (all stages),
and modified flakes.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the inspection of the site’s surface, 17 shovel tests were excavated across the
site (Table 4-21), 10 of which were positive for cultural material. Forty-eight artifacts were
collected, 37 from the upper 20 cm of the site and 14 from between 20 and 40 cmbs. The cultural
material collected consisted of 34 flakes, 9 pieces of angular debris, and three cores. Sixteen
shovel tests encountered bedrock at depths between 20 and 60 cmbs, and one encountered clay
at a depth of 20 cmbs. Cultural material collected from the shovel tests are considered to be in
secondary context due to erosion.

Site 41BL1309

Site 41BL1309 is a newly
recorded, historic-period site
measuring
approximately
55 x 55 m (Figure 4-42).
The site is located on a T-2
terrace of the Leon River
(now Belton Lake) that is
still periodically flooded by
high water levels. The soil is

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

made up of Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex silty clay loams intermixed with large limestone
cobbles. The terrace gently slopes upward to the west and contains several older growth oaks, a
small hackberry scatter, thick grasses, and bramble throughout the site’s surface, which allowed
for no surface visibility. Work conducted at the site consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel
testing. Post-field archival research was also conducted.
Surface Assemblage
During the inspection of the site’s surface, remnants of four structures were observed and
recorded as Features 1–4. Due to deterioration of the structures, structural debris has scattered
around the features. Debris observed consists primarily of building materials including
approximately 150 bricks, salt glazed brick, wire, corrugated metal sheeting, nails, wire, and
an old tire iron.
Features
During the inspection of the surface, three partially standing remains of historic-period
structures and a subterranean feature, which is likely a storm cellar, were encountered. The
features all appear to be associated with each other by proximity and consistent construction
methods.
Feature 1 is a foundation alignment (Figure 4-43). The foundation of this feature indicates that
the structure was originally partitioned into at least two rooms by a dividing wall. The aligned
foundation rocks are 24 x 32 ft and stand no higher than 2 ft from the ground. They are held
together with hard paste concrete (probably mixed with some Portland Cement) mixed with
mussel shells as aggregate.
Feature 2 has the highest percentage of intact walls (Figure 4-44). The walls are composed of
large limestone rocks that are mortared together by a hard, coarse concrete mixture similar to
that of Feature 1, which contains local mussel shell as a bonding agent. Portions of Feature 2’s
walls stand approximately 4 ft tall and create a rectangle approximately 16 x 31 ft.
Feature 3 is a 13 x 16-ft limestone rock foundation that has almost intact eastern and western
walls (Figure 4-45). Both walls stand roughly 3 ft high and are composed of smaller limestone
rocks and a finer-quality mortar mix than observed at Feature 2. However, mussel shell is
still used as a bonding agent with Feature 3’s mortar. Attached to Feature 3 is a brick scatter
(possible chimney fall) that stretches approximately 30 ft towards the northeast.
Feature 4 is a sunken storm shelter that is approximately 10 x 19 ft long (Figure 4-46). The
base of the feature is roughly 4 ft below the ground’s surface. The remaining components to
this feature are large limestone blocks, mortar reinforced with iron rods, and corrugated metal.
The reinforced mortar at Feature 4 is different than any other mortar observed with structures
at 41BL1309 and may represent a later addition to the site.

Shovel Testing
In addition to the inspection of the site’s surface, 12 shovel tests were excavated, six of which
were positive for cultural material. One shovel test contained a single flake, while the rest of
the shovel tests contained historic-period cultural materials associated with household items
and building material.
The most productive shovel test was ST 36B-2. This test yielded galvanized sheet metal and
can fragments (n=26), wire nails (n=9), cut nails (n=2), bed springs (n=13), metal box spring
edging (n=3), a crown bottle cap, fragments from a cast iron stove or tub footing (n=2), a metal

hinge fragment, a metal pill box lid fragment, clear bottle glass (n=2), clear window glass
(n=3), brown bottle glass (n=5), barbed wire (n=1), unidentified metal wire (n=2), and two
thin metal tack plates probably used on furniture. In addition, one angular chert fragment was
recovered. Artifacts retrieved from other shovel tests included one non-diagnostic fragment of
whiteware (ST 1), a fragment from a milk glass canning jar lid insert (ST 38B-2), a fragment
of clear window glass, three pieces of chert shatter (ST 3), and the one large flake (ST 7).
The wire nails and bed springs recovered from ST 36B-2 suggest that the artifact deposits at
this site largely date to the twentieth century. Wire nails were typically not commonly used in
domestic construction until after 1900 (Noel Hume 1991:254), while mattresses with coiled
bedsprings were not wide widely available until after about 1925 (Simmons Bedding Company
2010). A bottle crown cap also suggests a post-1900 date, as bottles with crown closures were
not invented until the last decade of the nineteenth century (Leif 1965). The presence of two
cut nails, however, may indicate that actual construction of the earliest features at the site
occurred around the 1890s.
Other artifacts are less diagnostic, though taken together it seems reasonable to assume the
artifacts at 41BL1309 reflect the period after 1900, with most deposition occurring after 1930.
This is because other than the cut nails, none of the artifacts can be definitely attributed to the
nineteenth century, and some, like the mattress springs, post-date 1925.
Archival Research
Site 41BL1309 was sold to the United States of America in 1953 by Needham T. Parker as 81.2
acres of the George Dumas Survey (Table 4-22). The deed listed a number of structures located
on the property, describing them with a fair amount of detail. They included:
• One 28 x 32-ft, six-room dwelling made of native rock veneer, with electric lights, and gas
• One 12 x 20 x 6-ft garage, native rock and masonry
• One 12 x 31-ft chicken house, native rock and masonry
• One 29 x 16-ft chicken house, pole frame
• One 4 x 4-ft privy, boxed
• One 10 x 12-ft storm cellar, concrete
• One 12 x 28-ft cow shed, pole frame
• One 14 x 18-ft hay barn, frame
• One 16 x 30-ft tractor shed, pole frame
• One 250-gallon butane gas system

Several of these structures correspond closely to those observed during field investigations.
Parker had owned the land since 1920, when he purchased 100 acres from his mother, Minnie
Phillips Whitlock (BCDR 317/299, also see 544/59). At the time of purchase, Parker was a
resident of LaSalle County, Illinois, according the deed. However, by 1930, Parker had moved
with his family to Bell County. They lived in Temple, where Parker worked as a sales agent
and manager for an automobile showroom (US Census 1930). They leased the property to
tenants, evidenced by entries in the Bell County deed records (e.g., BCDR 601/108). In 1948,
an M. J. Harrison leased the property for purposes of farming and had a pecan orchard (BCDR
601/108).
Parker’s mother Minnie Phillips Whitlock had purchased the property in 1914 from J. E.
Meeks (BCDR 252/96). Whitlock does not appear in the census for any year as a resident of
Bell County. However, Meeks apparently did live on this property in 1910. He is listed in the
1910 US Census as living in this area, along the Pendleton to Grove Road, which crossed the
river a few hundred meters north of where the current SH 36 crosses Belton Lake. Meeks was
39 years old, a widower, and lived with his 15 year-old married daughter Ruby Vaden and her
husband Bose (19). Of note, according to the census for the year, their neighbor was a 70-year
old widow from Tennessee named Ababell [sp?] Coppins. An Abigail Coppin sold Meeks 200
acres of the Dumas Survey in 1910 (BCDR 216/10). Neither Coppin[s] nor Meeks appear in
any other census year researched for this project. However, it is clear from a number of deeds
researched for this and adjacent tracts that Coppin did lived on this property. There are multiple
references to this property being the Coppin Homestead tract in records related to adjacent
properties (BCDR 342/339, 500/336).
Researchers were unable to locate any deeds indicating when Coppin purchased this property.
Previous landowners and residents are therefore unknown.
As stated earlier, each of the four structure ruins correspond to structures listed in the 1953
deed to the US; Feature 1 likely corresponds to the dwelling, which was faced with rock,
and measured about 28 x 32 ft, according to the deed record. Based on measurements taken
in the field, Feature 2 likely corresponds to the limestone chicken house, while Feature 3
corresponds to the camp house, which measured roughly 13 x 21 ft. The brick scatter adjoining
it probably represents the remains of the brick barbecue pit. Feature 4, the cellar, corresponds
to the concrete storm cellar mentioned in the deed records.
Based on background information, and the presence of two cut nails in one of the shovel
tests, it is possible that the earliest features at 41BL1309 could be the remains of the Coppin

homestead, which predates 1910 and was subsequently occupied by the Meeks family and
then by various tenants. However, the hard concrete holding Features 1 and 2 together suggest
a date range later than 1900. The storm cellar was almost certainly a later addition and was
probably built after Minnie Phillips Whitlock purchased the property.
Summary
Site 41BL1309 is a newly recorded, historic-period site measuring approximately 55 x 55 m.
Through the excavation of 12 shovel tests combined with a detailed surface inventory, it was
determined that the primary component to the site consists of four partially standing historicperiod structures with an associated surface and subsurface debris scatter. Through a detailed
archival search, the obtained deed records have matched field observations with historic records
and have dated the site’s earliest historic-period occupation to the early 1900s. One prehistoric
flake was recovered at 0–20 cmbs and appears to be an isolate.

4.6	Stampede Creek
The Stampede Creek survey segment totaled 173 acres, included 24 acres of steep slopes
(<20%), and received 27 shovel tests. The low sampling density of 0.18 tests per acre reflects
the fact that significant portions of the segment were inundated by high lake levels and could
not be surveyed. Seven of the 27 shovel tests were positive, returning a rate of 25.9 percent
ubiquity. Two sites were encountered during survey of the Stampede Creek segment. Both
sites are newly discovered and fall within the unknown prehistoric period due to the lack of
diagnostic artifacts. Detailed results of the two sites are presented below.

4.6.1

Site 41BL1334

Site 41BL1334 is a 170 x 35-m prehistoric site of an undetermined age, consisting of a burned
rock midden and an associated rockshelter. The site is located on a high finger ridge north
of Stampede Creek. The area
containing the burned rock
middens is broken into two
areas by a drainage that cuts
through the site (Figure 4-47).
The inlet itself serves as an
entrance to the rockshelter.
Unfortunately, the shelter is
640 Feet
approximately 10 m outside
our survey area, on private
property, along with the
ridgeline that connects the
two areas. Thus, the deposits
within the rockshelter we
not fully investigated. The
ground’s surface within the
41BL1334
recorded upland midden is
very hummocky due to the
numerous looter’s pits and

spoil piles (Figure 4-48).
Only small pockets of
undisturbed deposits remain
in between a few of the
looter’s holes. Other signs of
looting consisted of a broken

rockshelter outside of USACE property was visually

although the shelter has a large looter’s pit at its mouth,
the pit does not reach the bottom of the shelter’s cultural
deposits, nor does it extend far into the shelter.

encountered within the upper 20 cm, while two flakes
were encountered at 20–40 cmbs, and one was encountered at 40–60 cmbs (Table 4-23).
Although buried cultural material materials were encountered, they are considered to be
disturbed due to the large amount of looting that occurred at the site.
Summary
Site 41BL1334 is a 170 x 35-m prehistoric site of an undetermined age consisting of a burned
rock midden and an associated rockshelter. However, it appears the rockshelter and the heart
of the site are located outside the USACE property. Work was only conducted within the
USACE boundary and consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of eight shovel tests.

Inspection of the site’s surface revealed that the portion of the site within the USACE
boundaries had been heavily looted, destroying what was accessible. Shovel testing revealed
that an ephemeral scatter of buried cultural material is located within the upper 20 cm, but due
to the looting activities at the site, these materials are viewed as lacking contextual integrity.

The accumulation of artifacts within the site is predominately on the surface and consists of
primary and secondary debitage, preforms, modified flakes, cores, and tested pieces. Some of
the lithic debitage shows evidence of heating.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the inspection of the surface, six shovel tests were excavated, yielding 19 artifacts
from four shovel tests (Table 4-24). All the cultural material encountered was located in the
upper 20 cm of the site. Artifacts collected consisted of one biface, 11 flakes, two cores, four
pieces of angular debris, and one piece of fire-cracked rock. Bedrock was encountered in all
shovel tests at 40 cmbs.

Summary
41BL1335 is a 200 x 70-m prehistoric open campsite/lithic scatter of an undetermined age.
Work conducted at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of six shovel tests.
Shovel testing revealed that soils at the site are very shallow, with bedrock at a depth of 40
cmbs. During delineation, the true extent of the site was never determined because it is located
next to private property.

Aycock

The Aycock Road survey segment totaled 121 acres, of which five acres consisted of steep
slopes. The remaining 116 acres were investigated using 127 shovel tests, for a sampling
density of 1.09 tests per acre. Of these tests, 53 were positive, returning a rate of 71.6 percent
ubiquity. Fifteen previously recorded sites were revisited at the Aycock parcel along Kell
Creek. The sites found within this parcel are rockshelters, open campsites, and burned rock
midden sites. Due to the high concentration of sites in the parcel and their proximity to each
other, two of the sites were found to be spatially indistinguishable from other nearby sites and
were subsumed by the lower site number. Site 41BL284 was subsumed into 41BL282, and site
41BL288 was subsumed into 41BL287. Although a few diagnostic artifacts were encountered
at some of the sites, deflation of the soils encountered at all of the sites created a palimpsest
context whereby it was impossible to reliably assign temporal designations. As a result, all of
the sites are classified as having an unknown prehistoric occupation range. Detailed results for
all the sites within the Aycock parcel are presented below, in site number order.

4.7.1

Site 41BL28 (Kell Branch Shelter No. 1; Aycock Rockshelter)

Site 41BL28 was first recorded by Frank Watt in 1936. Since Watt’s initial visit, the site had
been revisited by both looters and archaeologists. Archaeologists who have since visited the
sites were R. L. Stephenson during the 1949 Reservoir Survey, and Bob Burleson during the
1966 Texas Archeological Salvage Project. On forms in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
Watt identifies 41BL28 as a rockshelter and associated mounds, while Stephenson only
identifies a rockshelter, and Burleson identifies several middens and rockshelters within the
Kell Creek system as included with the site. Based on the field map provided from Watt’s initial
visit, Burleson’s assessment is correct. The map identifies the rockshelter in question and an
additional 17 middens/camps areas. However, during past investigations of the area, such as
the Kell Branch Survey, many of these areas were assigned separate trinomial numbers, and
41BL28 only concerns the shelter.
41BL28 is a large rockshelter with two chambers situated on the eastern face of a ridgeline that
follows the main tributary of Kell Creek, and along the south fork of the creek (Figures 4-51
and 4-52). The shelter consists of a northern chamber and southern chamber. The chambers
are separated by a large limestone partition and sediment buildup. The northern chamber is
relatively small in comparison to the southern chamber, measuring approximately 15 m across
with an opening 2 m tall, narrowing towards the back of the shelter. The northern chamber
measures approximately 10 m in height. The southern chamber of the shelter measures
approximately 30 m in width and 5 m in height, narrowing towards the back. The height of the
southern chamber is approximately 20 m.
In the previous records concerning 41BL28, Burleson states that 32 burials were exhumed
during excavation conducted by Watt in the 1930s. Description of the excavations can be found
in Volume 2 of the Bulletin of the Central Texas Archeological Society 1936. In addition to
addressing the burials encountered during the excavations, Burleson also notes that pothunters
had visited the site and looted the talus slope, which was not excavated by Watt, and collected over

200 complete points and other
tools. During his assessment,
Burleson examined the
backdirt from the looter’s
pits and observed several
medial blades, scrapers, and
a base of a Friday knife. In
addition, lithic artifacts and
large amounts of bone were
observed eroding from the
talus to the base of the shelter
(Burleson 1966). Based on
the cultural material reported
to have been taken from the
site, 41BL28 is believed to
have an unknown prehistoric
cultural affiliation, possibly
ranging from the Archaic
period to the Late Prehistoric
period.

site. Both chambers and
along the front have been
extensively looted throughout the decades, and it seems to be a popular spot for people to
smoke methamphetamines. Evidence of this was observed in the main shelter with the creation
of modern hearths, a makeshift tent frame, lighters, glass vials, and aluminum foil. Due to
heavy vegetation on the surface and along the talus slope, no cultural material was observed,
but artifacts were encountered in the shovel tests excavated outside of the shelter.
Shovel Testing
In addition to 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area, three shovel tests were excavated, all
of which were positive (Table 4-25). All shovel tests conducted at the site were placed outside
of the rockshelter along the edge near the talus slope. In total, 38 artifacts were recovered: 60
percent were found at 0–20 cmbs, 24 percent were found at 20–40 cmbs, 11 percent at 40–60
cmbs, and 5 percent were found between 60 and 80 cmbs. ST 2 was the only test that had
artifacts to a depth of 80 cmbs, while STs 3O-4 and 3 only had artifacts in the upper 20 cm.

was
originally
documented in 1935 by Frank
Watt. Subsequently, the site has
been revisited by archaeologists
in 1949 and in 1966 as well as
by looters, who have continued
to visit the site throughout the
decades since its discovery.
During the investigations by
Frank Watt, 32 human burials
were excavated and have since
been repatriated, although it
is not clear if the remains were
repatriated within the shelter or
in another area. The subsequent
work conducted by Stephenson
in 1949 and Burleson in 1966
consisted of redocumenting the
site, and noted further vandalism
of the shelter by looters. During
Burleson’s revisit in 1966,
Burleson notes that pothunters
have collected over 200 complete
points along with other artifacts
from the talus slope.

During February of 2010,
EComm archaeologists excavated three positive shovel tests on the outer edge of the shelter. In
those shovel tests, 59 artifacts were encountered at depths ranging from 0 to 20 cmbs in one test,
20 to 40 in one test, and 0 to 80 cmbs in one test. Although cultural material was encountered
in all three shovel tests at varying depths, it is uncertain if the contextual integrity of the
cultural material is valid due to numerous reports of looting activities and current evidence of
disturbance.

Site 41BL282 (Aycock No. 3)

Site 41BL282 was first recorded by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell Branch Survey and was
described as a burned rock midden. The site is located on a terrace edge overlooking the east
fork of Kell Creek to the north. Like many other terrace edge sites encountered during our

In addition to the inspection
of the burned rock midden,
a 100 percent pedestrian survey was conducted along the ridgetop, slope, and floodplain in
order to determine the site’s extent. The surface visibility of the site is limited to open areas of
limestone outcroppings. Much of the ground is covered in approximately 5 cm of leaf litter.
Artifacts on the surface consisted of flakes, unifaces, bifaces, and angular debris, but appear to
be out of context due to deflated soils.
Shovel Testing
In addition to a pedestrian survey of the site, 21 shovel tests were excavated (Table 4-26), 14 of
which contained cultural material at a depth of 0–20 cmbs. The artifacts consisted of 30 flakes,
one biface, and 10 pieces of angular debris. No diagnostic artifacts were encountered. Based on
shovel testing of the area, cultural material was encountered that linked 41BL282 to 41BL284.

Summary
Site 41BL282 was first recorded by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell Branch Survey and
described as a burned rock midden. The site is located on a terrace edge overlooking the east
fork of Kell Creek to the north. Like many other terrace edge sites encountered during our
survey, these sites are expansive, with the majority continuing onto private property. 41BL282
is mainly located on the terrace edge, with some remnants eroding down slope onto the
floodplain. Many of the surrounding sites in the Aycock survey segment contain burned rock
middens located on floodplains. However, other than a few eroded artifacts, the floodplain at
41BL282 is devoid of any in situ artifacts or features. Based on the surrounding settlement
pattern, it is postulated that inhabitants of the site likely utilized the associated floodplain even
though no cultural material was identified.
Subsurface cultural material included flakes, bifaces, and angular debris. Artifacts on the
surface consisted of flakes, uniface, biface, and angular debris, but appear to be out of context
due to deflated soils. No diagnostic artifacts were observed during our investigation of the site,
nor were any reported during the initial visit to the site. Due to the overall lack of diagnostic
artifacts at 41BL282, the site is considered to have an unknown prehistoric cultural affiliation.

4.7.3

Site 41BL283

Site 41BL283 was first documented in 1985 by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell Branch
Survey, and was recorded as a large burned rock midden. No further information about the site
was provided on the State of Texas Archeological Site Forms.
Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL283 in February of 2010 to reassess the condition
of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. The site is located on the
edge of a limestone terrace bound by private property to the north and by the terrace edge to the
south (see Figure 4-53). The limestone ridge stands approximately 15 m above the east fork of
Kell Creek, overlooking a grotto-type pool directly across 41BL283 (Figure 4-54). The vegetal
setting of the terrace consists of small grasses, greenbrier, cedar trees, oak trees, cactus, yucca,
and leaf litter. Visibility of the surface is poor and limited to limestone outcroppings and bare
patches of soil. At the time of our visit to the site, approximately 20 looter’s pits were observed
(Figure 4-55), 18 on the USACE side of the fence and two on private property. Sizes of the
looter’s pits varied from 50 cm to 5 m, with depths ranging from 30 to 100 cmbs. Based on trash

left behind during looting
activities, it appears that these
activities have occurred over
the past few years. Evidence
of this comes from a Sara Lee
bread bag dated September
28, 2009, and a Powerade
bottle with a date of 2008.
Locals and pothunters in the
area have long known the
locations of sites within the
Kell Creek area, and reports
of trespassing in the area have
been documented by local
officials and landowners.
Surface Assemblage
During our visit to the site,
a 100 percent pedestrian
was conducted. Inspection
of the surface was restricted
to a portion of the ridgeline
between the private property
fenceline and the ridge edge.
The majority of artifacts
observed at the site were
limited to the numerous
backdirt piles from the
looter’s pits and consisted
of bifaces, unifaces, tools,
burned rock, ground stone,
numerous flakes, and angular
debris.
No
diagnostic
artifacts were observed.

Shovel Testing
In addition to a complete inspection of the site’s surface, six shovel tests were excavated
(Table 4-27). Three contained buried cultural material in the upper 40 cm of the site. Artifacts
collected from the shovel tests consisted of five flakes, one biface, one uniface, and two pieces
of angular debris. Eight of the nine artifacts were encountered from 0 to 20 cmbs, while one
piece of angular debris was encountered at 20–40 cmbs. Based on the distribution of artifacts,
an intact cultural component is present from 0 to 20 cmbs. Bedrock was encountered in all
shovel tests at depths ranging from 20 to 60 cmbs.

Summary
Site 41BL283 was first documented in 1985 by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell Branch
Survey and was recorded as a large burned rock midden. During our survey of the area, the site
was revisited and redocumented. The site is located on the edge of a limestone terrace bound
by private property to the north and by the terrace edge to the south. The has been exposed to
intense looting for many years, which has significantly affected the preservation of the cultural
material. No diagnostic artifacts were observed during our investigation of the site, nor were
any reported during the initial visit to the site. Due to the overall lack of diagnostic artifacts at
41BL283, the site is considered to have an unknown prehistoric cultural affiliation.

Site 41BL284

Site 41BL284 was first documented in 1985 by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell Branch
Survey and was described as a burned rock midden. Location and setting of the site were not
provided in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, but the USACE provided UTM coordinates
for its location. However, we were unable to locate the using those coordinates. The
coordinates placed the site on a ridgetop south of the east fork of Kell Creek. A pedestrian
survey accompanied by shovel testing was conducted, but no midden was observed. However,
artifacts were observed on the surface and in the shovel tests. The scatter of artifacts and those
encountered in the shovel tests continued and linked to 41BL282. Based on our investigations,
41BL284 is now subsumed by 41BL282.

Site 41BL285

Site 41BL285 was first documented in 1985 by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell Branch
Survey and was described as a burned rock midden. No further information about the site was
provided on the State of Texas Archeological Site Forms.
Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL285 in February of 2010 to reassess the condition of
the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. The site is located on a floodplain
overlooking the east fork of Kell Creek to the south. Surface visibility of the floodplain is poor
due to the abundance of leaf litter, dead tree fall from past flooding events, and elm trees. At
the time of our survey, four looter’s pits were observed on the midden, one of which measured

approximately 3 x 2 m with a
depth of 1 m (Figure 4-56). In
order to fully inspect the site,
archaeologists
conducted
a 100 percent pedestrian
survey accompanied with
shovel tests.
Surface Assemblage
Although a visual inspection
of the site’s surface was
conducted, no artifacts were
observed surrounding the
midden. Artifacts observed
at the site were limited to
those found in the backfill
dirt piles from the looter’s
pits, and consisted of burned
rock and few flakes.

Summary
Site 41BL285 was first documented in 1985 by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell Branch
Survey and was described as a burned rock midden. During our survey of the area we revisited
and redocumented the site. It appears the looting has greatly impacted to cultural footprint
of 41BL285. Artifacts observed at the site were limited to those found in the backfill dirt
piles from the looter’s pits and consisted of burned rock and few flakes. The lack of artifacts
indicates that the site is limited to the burned rock midden, which has been destroyed. Due to
the lack of diagnostic artifacts, 41BL285 is viewed as having an unknown prehistoric cultural
affiliation.

Site 41BL286

Site 41BL286 was first recorded by Bradle and Shafer in 1985 during the Kell Branch Survey.
The site was documented as a “complex site containing rockshelters along the escarpment edge
with extensive midden deposits on the Kell Branch floodplain below and an extensive midden
deposit on the ridgetop” (Bradle and Shafer 1985). Archaeologists from EComm revisited
41BL286 in February of 2010 to reassess the condition of the site and its potential eligibility
for nomination to the NRHP.
The shelter faces south and is located on the southernmost ridge comprising 41BL287.
Archaeologists encountered two rockshelters that were vertically aligned, one on top of the
other (Figure 4-57). The shelters were separated by an overhang that served as a terrace/living
surface for the upper one and a cover for the bottom one. The upper shelter was fairly small with
an overhang extending out approximately 2 m. The clearance of the shelter from the overhang to
the surface measured approximately 2.5 m and narrowed as you entered further into the shelter
(Figure 4-58). The depth of
the shelter corresponded to
the length of the overhang.
The width of the shelter

some of the overhang of the

fall directly in front of the
shelter’s mouth, which has
trapped sediment within the
lower shelter. Eight looter’s
pits were observed, four in
the upper shelter and four in
the lower shelter.

consists of large cedar and
oak trees. Although visibility
of the surface was poor, small
areas of shallow soils and
limestone outcroppings were
visible. During our survey
of the ridgetop directly
above the shelters, four large
looter’s pits were observed
measuring from 1 to 5 m in
diameter, destroying any
existence of a midden.

of the site, investigators
note that the site consists of

rockshelters, and midden
deposits on the ridgetop
above the shelters and on the floodplain below the shelters. At the time of our investigations,
archaeologists were only able to access the ridgetop and rockshelters due to the high water
levels of Belton Lake. Currently, the reported midden deposits of the floodplain are completely
submerged.
Surface Assemblage
Surface inspection of the site consisted of a 100 pedestrian survey of the site on the ridgetop
and along the entrance of the rockshelters. Survey of the ridgetop and rockshelter entrances
showed that the cultural materials present at the site were concentrated in the backfill dirt of
the looter’s pits on the ridgetop and in the shelters. Several flakes, unifaces, and bifaces were
observed, along with looter’s trash such as ½-inch mesh screen and shovel handles.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the 100 pedestrian survey of the site, three shovel tests were excavated. Due
to the shallow soils on the ridgetop, the three shovel tests were reserved for areas containing
deeper deposits, i.e., rockshelters. Two of the shovel tests contained cultural material. Out of
the 28 artifacts collected from the shovel tests, 18 were located in the upper 20 cm of the test
and 10 from 20 to 40 cmbs. Although cultural materials were encountered in the shovel test,
they were excavated in the boundaries of a deflated spoil pile of looter’s backdirt and are not
considered to have contextual integrity.
Summary

and midden deposits on the ridgetop above the shelters and on the floodplain below the shelters.
Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL286 in February of 2010 to reassess the condition
of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
Archaeologists encountered two rockshelters that were vertically aligned, one on top of the
other. In addition to relocating the rockshelters, archaeologists reexamined the midden deposit
located on the ridgetop above the shelter. Although we were able to revisit the shelters and the
midden located on the ridge above the shelters, we were unable to locate the midden located
on the floodplain. It is presumed that the midden once located in the floodplain is currently
submerged. During the testing and survey of the site, no diagnostic artifacts were observed or
encountered. Due to the overall lack of diagnostic artifacts, 41BL286 is considered to have an
unknown prehistoric cultural affiliation.

4.7.7

Site 41BL287

Site 41BL287 was originally recorded during the Kell Branch Survey by Bradle and Shafer in
1985. The site was documented as a rockshelter with an associated lithic scatter on top of the
escarpment housing the shelter. Currently, the site is bounded by private property fencelines to
the east and the terrace edge to the west.
Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL287 to reassess the condition of the site and its
potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. During our investigations, both the lithic
scatter and rockshelter were encountered. The previously recorded lithic scatter proved to
be expansive, sprawling approximately 175 x 100 m across the tops of two ridges that are
separated by a small drainage. As the drainage flows downward between the two landforms, it
creates a large flowstone where the rockshelter is located. The ridges stand approximately 30
m above the drainage, and are covered with cedar, cactus, scrub brush, grasses, and leaf litter,
which contributes to poor visibility of the surface.
The rockshelter associated with the site is located in the drainage below the escarpment along
the slope of the northern ridge (see Figure 4-57). The shelter consists of one large chamber with
five access points, and is part of a subterranean cave system below the escarpment. Evidence
of this is seen by the light coming in from the back side of the shelter. The access points were
created due to erosional processes. Numerous large limestone overhangs have collapsed around
the mouth of the shelter, trapping sediment. The shelter measures approximately 30 m wide,
with an opening of 4 m and a depth of 50 m (Figure 4-59). At the time of our investigation,
approximately 20 looter’s pits were observed, located mainly at the entrance of the shelter.
The sediments at the back of the shelter appear to be intact, but the narrowness of the opening
makes it difficult to access. Due to the location of the rockshelter in relation to the drainage and
Kell Creek, flooding occurs during time of heavy rains and lake flooding.
Another site, 41BL288, was previously recorded nearby; however, no indication of its presence
was found. 41BL288 was originally described as a lithic procurement site and was supposed
to be located on top of the ridge in close proximity to 41BL287. Based on the distribution of
shovel tests, it appears that 41BL288 and 41BL287 are one continuous site, and therefore were

is covered in leaf litter and
grasses, areas of limestone

of cultural material. During
the inspection of the site,

along the ridgetop and in
the drainage area where the
rockshelter is located. Cultural material observed along the ridgetop and consisted of flakes,
cores, angular debris, biface fragments, and very few tools.
The opening of the shelter is covered with a larger scatter of cultural material consisting of
mussel shell, bone (both faunal and human), and lithics. Much of the material observed at the
mouth of the shelter is attributed to the numerous looter’s pits scattered throughout the shelter.
Modern trash was also observed and consisted of beer cans and plastic trash.
Shovel Testing
In addition to surface inspection of the site, subsurface testing was also employed. Twenty-four
shovel tests were excavated (Table 4-28). Shovel tests were excavated on transects along the
ridgetop then further expanded upon during the revisit of the site. One group of shovel tests
(STs 1.1–1.9) concentrated on one ridgetop, and another group (STs 2.1–2.7) concentrated on
the other ridgetop and in the drainage. Of the 24 shovel tests excavated, 14 were positive and
yielded a combined assemblage of 189 artifacts. Cultural material consisted of flakes, modified
flakes, angular debris, fire-cracked rock, a biface, and two projectile points. The projectile
points were recovered from two shovel tests on top of the ridge and are Wells and Marshall
types (Figure 4-60). They were recovered from approximately the same depth, but belong to
two different chronological periods, the Middle Archaic and Late Archaic. This indicates the
soils are deflated and a palimpsest has been created, making the site’s temporal assignment
difficult.
Summary
The site 41BL287 consists of an expansive lithic scatter that covers two ridges separated by
a small intermittent drainage and a rockshelter with five individual openings. The shelter

consists of one large chamber with five access
points, and is part of a subterranean cave system
below the escarpment. Both the ridges and the
shelter have been exposed to looting, although their
disturbances are primarily focused at the mouth of
the shelter. Shovel tests were placed along both
ridgetops and yielded numerous artifacts, including
two projectile points that appear to be Archaic in
age. No shovel tests were excavated within the
rockshelter due to its restrictive space. Although
two Archaic dart points were encountered, the soils
are deflated and a palimpsest has been created,
making temporal assignment difficult. Based on
the distribution of shovel tests, it appears that
41BL288 and 41BL287 are one continuous site,
and therefore were grouped together. 41BL288 is
now subsumed by 41BL287.

Site 41BL288

Site 41BL288 was originally recorded as a lithic procurement site for a black chert source by
Bradle and Shafer during the 1985 Kell Branch Survey. During our survey, we were unable
to locate the site using the UTM coordinates in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas or UTM
coordinates provided by the USACE. One of the coordinates locates the site on private property,
while the other places the site in Belton Lake.

Based on the projected location of the site in shapefiles provided by the USACE, the site
is located on the ridge where 41BL287 is also present. The distribution of positive shovel
tests, excavated by EComm, indicates that 41BL288 and 41BL287 is one continuous site, and
therefore were grouped together. 41BL288 is now subsumed by 41BL287.

4.7.9

Site 41BL289

Site 41BL289 was first documented in 1985 by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell Branch Survey
and was described as a lithic scatter. No further information about the site was provided on the
State of Texas Archeological Site Forms. Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL289 to
reassess the condition of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
The site is located on a limestone ridge over looking Belton Lake to the north (Figures 4-61
and 4-62). The site is bounded by an unnamed intermittent drainage to the west, Belton Lake
to the north, private property
to the south, and Kell Creek

Surprisingly,
unlike
the
majority of the sites revisited
along Kell Creek, looting
was limited within 41BL289.
Although approximately three
looter’s pits were observed on
the northern tip of the ridge,
all looter’s pits were small in
size and shallow, with depths
reaching 20–30 cmbs. The
shallowness of the pits is due
to the lack of soils along the
ridgetop.

Archaeologists
conducted
a 100 percent pedestrian
survey of the site, including
examination of the backdirt
from the looter’s pits. While
examining the backdirt, large
cores and core flakes were
observed, which looters are
generally uninterested in.
They were not limited to
the spoil piles. More were
were concentrated along the
western and northern portions
of the site, in addition to flakes,
bifaces, unifaces, angular
debris, and broken tools.

Shovel Testing
In addition to surface inspection of the site, 11 shovel tests were excavated across the ridge,
only two of which were positive for cultural material. The cultural material collected from the
two shovel tests totaled 355 and consisted of 192 flakes, 5 edge-modified flakes, 16 cores and
core fragments, and 142 pieces of angular debris. All cultural material encountered was found
in the upper 30 cm of the site. One shovel test in particular, located near the edge of the terrace,
consisted entirely of lithic material and was terminated at 30 cm due to the vast amount of
artifacts and the destruction the shovel test was causes to the cultural material. All other shovel
tests encountered bedrock at depths ranging between 40 and 60 cmbs. Based on the amount of
core and angular debris encountered within the shovel tests it appears that the site was utilized
as a procurement site with the majority of activity occurring along the tip of the ridge.
Summary
Site 41BL289 was first documented in 1985 by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell Branch
Survey and was described as a lithic scatter. During EComm’s survey of the area, 41BL289
was revisited and redocumented. Surprisingly, unlike at the majority of the sites revisited along
Kell Creek, looting was limited. The site is located on a limestone ridge over looking Belton
Lake to the north. The site is bounded by an unnamed intermittent drainage to the west, Belton
Lake to the north, private property to the south, and Kell Creek to the east. Cultural material is
limited to the western portion of the ridge and consists of flakes, edge-modified flakes, cores
and core fragments, and angular debris. The site appears to have isolated pockets of extremely
dense lithics. Based on this shovel test and the looter’s pits in the surrounding area, this location
of the site appears to be a procurement area, whereas the rest of the site is a lithic scatter.

4.7.10 Site 41BL290
Site 41BL290 was first recorded by Bradle and Shafer in 1985 during the Kell Branch Survey,
as a lithic procurement site associated with two small rockshelters. No further information
about the site was provided on the State of Texas Archeological Site Forms. Archaeologists
from EComm revisited 41BL290 to reassess the condition of the site and its potential eligibility
for nomination to the NRHP.
The site is located on a finger ridge west of the unnamed intermittent drainage that bounds
41BL289 (see Figure 4-61). The finger ridge is bound by the unnamed drainage to the east,
private property to the south, Belton Lake to the north, and another unnamed drainage to the
west. Topographically, the northern and eastern edges of the site are at lower elevations of the
ridge as it gently slopes north into Belton Lake. The upper portion of the site, within our project
area, is located on a slope. Given the topographic setting of the site, procurement activities of
the site occurred along the eastern and northern edges of the site, while other activities may
have occurred on the ridgetop located on private property.
The vegetal setting of the site consists of yucca, cedar, oak, short grasses, and leaf litter.
Visibility of the site was poor due to the leaf litter, but pockets of limestone outcroppings and
bare soil patches helped in the surface inspection. Disturbances observed at the site consisted
of two cut roads, an abandoned one and a newer one, both located along the eastern edge of
the site (Figure 4-63). The roads were created to access the lake by the property owners to the
south.
At the time of our investigations, only the procurement portion was encountered. The drainage
between 41BL289 and 41BL290 and the northern face of the ridge were inspected, but no
shelters were encountered. A possibility of why the shelters were not encountered may be
due to property lines in
the area. A fence located
along the ridge serving as
the southern boundary of
41BL289 and 41BL290
ran the entire contour of
the ridge’s side slopes,
preventing
archaeologists
from examining the head of
the drainage. Examination of
the site consisted of a surface
inspection accompanied by
shovel testing.
Surface Assemblage
The distribution of artifacts
on the surface showed that
the majority of the site

was concentrated along the eastern edge of the finger ridge. Artifacts present on the surface
consisted of primarily flakes and cores.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the examination of the surface of the site, six shovel tests were excavated. Only
one was positive for cultural material. Cultural material was encountered within the upper 20
cm of the shovel test and consisted of one core, one modified flake, and two pieces of angular
debris. Although artifacts were encountered, the context of the material is in question due to the
gently sloping landform. It is speculated that the artifacts are displaced due to erosion.
Summary
Site 41BL290 was first recorded by Bradle and Shafer in 1985 during the Kell Branch Survey,
as a lithic procurement site associated with two small shelters. At the time of our investigations,
only the procurement area was encountered. The drainage between 41BL289 and 41BL290 and
the northern face of the ridge were inspected, but no shelters were encountered. Examination
of the site consisted of a surface inspection accompanied by shovel testing. The distribution of
artifacts on the surface showed that the majority of the site was concentrated along the eastern
edge of the finger ridge.

4.7.11 Site 41BL293
Site 41BL293 was first documented during the Kell Branch Survey in 1985 by Bradle and
Shafer. The site was recorded as a rockshelter. No further information about the site was
provided on the State of Texas Archeological Site Forms. Archaeologists from EComm
revisited 41BL293 in February of 2010 to reassess the condition of the site and its potential
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
The site is located on the eastern face of a ridge overlooking southern branch of Kell Creek to the
east. The site is bounded by the USACE fence and the ridge edge and measures approximately
35 m across the face, with a depth of 10 m and an opening of 5 m, which narrow towards
the back (Figure 4-64 and Figure 4-65). Although the site is located on USACE property,
the site is heavily disturbed from looting activities that have occurred over several decades.
Approximately six looter’s pits were observed, ranging in size from 1 to 4 m.
Surface Assemblage
Archaeologists examined the rockshelter and the ridge above it. Investigations of the site
consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey accompanied by shovel testing. Due to the poor
visibility of the site, attributed to leaf litter, grass, cactus, greenbrier, limestone collapse, and
cedar tress along the ridgetop and slope, the only artifacts observed were located in the backdirt
of the looter’s pits. Artifacts observed consisted of numerous flakes, some bifaces, and some
unifaces.

4.7.12

Site 41BL294

Site 41BL294 is recorded as a burned rock
midden and was recorded by Bradle and
Shafer during the Kell Creek Survey in 1985.
No further information about the site was
provided on the State of Texas Archeological
Site Forms. Archaeologists from EComm
revisited 41BL294 in February of 2010 to
reassess the condition of the site and its
potential eligibility for nomination to the
NRHP.
The site is located on the floodplain of Kell
Creek at the base of two ridges, where many
rockshelters are located and where the south
branch of the creek splits into two tributaries

(see
Figure 4-64). The vegetal setting of the

site consists of ragweed, oak, cedar, elm,
grass, and leaf litter. During our investigation, the burned rock midden was relocated; however,
it had been riddled with numerous looter’s pits, completely destroying the integrity of the site.
Despite the destruction of the site, archaeologists conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey
accompanied by shovel testing.
Surface Assemblage
Due to the vegetation present at the site, visibility of the surface was poor, and therefore no
artifacts were observed in the surrounding area of the burned rock midden. The only artifacts
present at the site were located in the mounds of backfill surrounding the looter’s pits. Artifacts
observed in the spoils of the looter’s pits consisted of mussel shell, burned flakes, and firecracked rock.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the inspection of the surface at the site, six shovel tests were excavated. All
shovel tests were located in the floodplain near and around the burned rock midden. Two
shovel tests were positive for cultural material, which consisted of 18 snail shells, three mussel
shells, three flakes, and one piece of fire-cracked rock. The context of the shell artifacts is in
question due to the site’s location within the floodplain, where it has been periodically exposed
to aquatic settings. Given the disturbance observed at the site and because the site is located at
the base of a steep slope, cultural material at the site lacks contextual integrity.

Summary
Site 41BL294 is recorded as a burned rock midden by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell
Creek Survey in 1985. Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL294 in February of 2010
to reassess the condition of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
The site is located on a floodplain of Kell Creek at the base of two ridges, where many
rockshelters are located and where the south branch of the creek splits into two tributaries. This
site consists of a burned rock midden that is riddled with numerous looter’s pits, completely
destroying the integrity of the site. Mounds of backfill were seen surrounding the pits, and
artifacts present in the backdirt consisted of mussel shell, burned flakes, and fire-cracked rock.
Due to periodic flooding, the context of some cultural material is in question.

4.7.13 Site 41BL295 (Aycock No. 2)
Site 41BL295, also known as Aycock No. 2, was first documented in 1985 during the Kell
Branch Survey by Bradle and Shafer. The site was recorded as a rockshelter with an associated
midden. No further information about the site was provided on the State of Texas Archeological
Site Forms. Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL295 in February of 2010 to reassess
the condition of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
The site is located on the northern face of prominent ridge overlooking the southern branch of
Kell Creek. The midden is located on the top of the ridge housing the rockshelter. The site is
bounded by private property to the south, a small drainage to the northwest, and Kell Creek to
the north (see Figure 4-64). Although boundaries are identified by geographical features and
USACE fencing, the site extend southward onto private property. The vegetal setting of the
ridgetop consists of cedar, oak, cactus, small scrub brush, and leaf litter, limiting the visibility
of the surface. Both features of the site were relocated and inspected.
The midden was relocated, but it had been looted. Evidence of this was seen in the four looter’s
pits on top of the midden, each measuring 1 m in diameter. Archaeologists also encountered
the rockshelter.
The rockshelter located on the northern face of the ridge measures approximately 35 m across,
with an opening measuring 5 m high, and a depth of 10 m, and it was heavily disturbed from
looter activities. Approximately 26 looter’s pits were observed within and outside the shelter.
The looter’s pits observed ranged in size from 1 to 3 m with depths up to 50 cm (Figure 4-66).
Surface Assemblage
Once both of the features were encountered, archaeologists conducted a 100 percent pedestrian
survey of the site. Although visibility of the surface was poor, an ephemeral lithic scatter on the
surface of the ridgetop was visible on the limestone outcroppings. Artifacts present consisted
of small flakes and angular debris. Artifacts were also present near the rockshelter, but were
located in the mounds of backdirt from the looter’s pits. These artifacts consisted of flakes,
bifaces, unifaces, and angular debris.

Shovel Testing
In addition to the survey of
the site, 11 shovel tests were
excavated (Table 4-29).
Shovel tests were conducted
on transects (ST 2O-2)
through the site then were
followed by an additional
shovel testing of the ridgetop
(STs 1.1–1.7) and near the
rockshelter (STs 2.1–2.2 and
2.4). All shovel tests were
positive for cultural material.
Cultural material consisted
of flakes, mussel shell, snail
shell, a biface, fire-cracked

rock, and angular debris.
Shovel tests all reached
bedrock at depths between 20 and 60 cmbs, while shovel tests near the rockshelter reached
bedrock at depths between 40 and 100 cmbs. The majority of soils encountered in the shovel
tests on the ridgetop were shallow, except for those located at the edge of the ridge. Soils near
the rockshelter appear to be moderately deep; however, the area has been completely destroyed
due to looting activities. No diagnostic artifacts were encountered.
Summary
Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL295 in February of 2010 to reassess the condition
of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. While surveying the upper
portion of the ridge where the midden was located, archaeologists encountered an ephemeral
lithic scatter on the surface of the ridgetop. Artifacts present consisted of small flakes and
angular debris. The midden was relocated in addition to the lithic scatter, and indicated a high
degree of disturbance from looting. A shovel test was placed on the midden and excavated to a

depth of 80 cmbs. Cultural material observed from the midden consisted only of fire-cracked
rock ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm.
Archaeologists also examined the rockshelter along the face of the ridge. The shelter was
heavily disturbed from looting. Approximately 26 looter’s pits were observed inside and
outside the shelter. Artifacts were located in the backdirt of the looter’s pits and consisted of
flakes, bifaces, unifaces, and angular debris.
No diagnostic artifacts were observed or collected during our investigation of the site. Due to
the absence of diagnostic artifacts at the time of our survey and the initial survey, 41BL295 is
viewed as having an unknown cultural affiliation.

4.7.14 Site 41BL299
Site 41BL299 was originally recorded in 1985 by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell Branch
Survey, and was described as a rockshelter with an associated lithic procurement area. No
further information about the site was provided on the State of Texas Archeological Site Forms.
Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL299 in February of 2010 to reassess the condition
of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
The site is situated along the northeastern edge of Kell Creek, where it begins to drain away
from Belton Lake. The rockshelter portion of the site is located at the base of a limestone ridge
within a small inlet created from a drainage that runs from the top of the limestone upland,
while the procurement portion of the site is located above the shelter along the limestone
ridgetop (Figure 4-67.).
During our survey of the area, the site had been relocated and both areas had been examined.
Upon visiting the site, it was found that the rockshelter originally recorded in 1985 had
collapsed. The shelter currently measures approximately 1 m in height, 20 m in width, and 5–6
m in depth, significantly narrowing towards the back of the shelter. Several limestone boulders
that appear to be remnants of an overhang are scattered across the front of the shelter, some
trapping sediments behind them (Figure 4-68). The sediments, deposited from runoff, appear
to be a meter thick and continually washed out with rains. Much of what is left of the upper
portion of the site is a steep side slope covered predominately with cedar, oak, greenbrier,
grasses, and leaf litter. It appears that the collapsed overhang observed at the mouth of the
shelter may have once been a midslope terrace that served as a procurement area as seen at
many of the sites in the area. However, due to continual drainage activity and erosion over
the past 25 years the topographic feature has since collapsed and is no longer present. What is
currently present are the remnants of the rockshelter and lithic procurement area.
Surface Assemblage
Although very little of the site remains, archaeologists examined both areas of the site looking
for any visible cultural material on the surface. During the investigation, artifacts were observed

at the mouth of the rockshelter
but not in the procurement area.
Artifacts observed at the shelter
consisted of angular debris and

Shovel Testing
Due the shallow soils observed
in the area of the procurement
area and the disturbance and
steepness of the drainage at the
mouth of the rockshelter, no
shovel tests were excavated.

The site is located directly across from 41BL28 along a toe slope of a ridgeline overlooking the
south fork of Kell Creek to the west. The site is situated in an area covered in leaf litter, small
scrub brush, cedar, elm, and oak. At the time of our investigation we encountered the midden,
but it was completely destroyed by two large looter’s pits measuring approximately 5 m in
diameter (Figure 4-69).
Although the site was only recognized as a fire-cracked rock midden during the initial
investigation, EComm archaeologists fully examined the site by survey and shovel testing to
determine whether there may have been more to the site.

Summary
41BL300 is a burned rock midden first recorded in 1985 by Bradle and Shafer during the Kell
Branch Survey. In February of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited the site to reassess the
condition of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
The site is located directly across from 41BL28 (Ayacock Shelter) along a toe slope of a
ridgeline overlooking the south fork of Kell Creek to the west. At the time of our investigation
we encountered the midden, but it was completely destroyed. During the inspection of the site
area, no cultural material was observed except for that located in the spoil piles of the looter’s
pits. The artifacts observed consisted of numerous burned rock and few flakes. Based on our
investigations of the site, it appears that the original description of the site was correct.

4.7.16 Isolated Find
One isolated find was observed on the surface within
the Aycock survey segment along the floodplain of Kell
Creek. A single Godley dart point (Figure 4-70) was
encountered on the edge of the creek bank. No shovel
tests were excavated in this location because the water
levels of the creek were high, and shovel testing the
inundated area was not feasible.

4.8	Leona Park
Totaling 128 acres, the Leona Park survey segment included 14 acres of steep slopes that were
exluded from shovel testing. The remaining 114 acres were investigated using 84 shovel tests,
for a sampling density of 0.73 tests per acre. Of the 84 tests, 23 were positive, returning a rate
of 27.4 percent ubiquity. Four new sites were recorded within the Leona Park survey segment.
Due to the lack of diagnostic artifacts observed during the recordatings, all fall within the
unknown prehistoric period. Results of each site are presented below in site number order.

4.8.1

Site 41BL1322

Site 41BL1322 is a prehistoric rockshelter of an undetermined age. The site is situated within an
inlet created from a series of seeps within the limestone formation that drains into Belton Lake
to the north at the confluence of two steeply sloped ridges. The shelter measures approximately
38 m across, with an opening measuring 5 m, has a depth of 5.2 m, and sits approximately 3
m above the inlet (Figure 4-71).
The interior and mouth of the
shelter has been extensively
looted and is marked by five
looter’s pits measuring in size

Shovel Testing
In addition to surface inspection of the site, two shovel tests were excavated. ST 1 was excavated
at the western corner of the shelter’s mouth, and ST 2 was excavated at the center. Only ST 2
was positive for cultural material; three flakes and three pieces of angular debris were collected
at 20–40 cmbs, and two flakes and three pieces of angular debris were found at 40–60 cmbs.
Bedrock was encountered in ST 1 at 40 cmbs and in ST 2 at 60 cmbs.
Summary
41BL1322 is a prehistoric rockshelter of an undetermined age. Work conducted at the site
consisted of a surface inspection and excavation of two shovel tests. Inspection of the shelter
revealed that the shelter was marked with five 2 x 3-m looter’s pits, and cultural material present
at the site was washing out by active drainage of the seeps and flooding of Belton Lake. Shovel
testing revealed that the deposits in the shelter appear to be intact and extend to a depth of 60
cmbs.

Site 41BL1323

Site 41BL1323 is a 220 x 40-m prehistoric open campsite of an undetermined age. The site is
located on an upland ridge terrace over looking Belton Lake to the west (Figure 4-73). Much
of the area had been modified by the construction of Leona Park Road along the terrace edge
of the site, construction of two modern buildings, a park restroom that is no longer in use and
a utilities building, and a power line road that bisects the site (Figure 4-74). Much of the site
is located southeast of the road. Soils were of the Speck association. The site is covered in
secondary growth, cedar trees, rye grass, and leaf litter, resulting in poor surface visibility,
approximately 20 percent.

Site 41BL1324

Site 41BL1324 is a 260 x 4-m subsurface prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age (see
Figure 4-71). The site is located on a finger ridge overlooking Belton Lake to the north. The
western side slope creates the setting for the rockshelter discussed as 41BL1322. The vegetal
setting of the site consists of short grasses, cactus, cedar, oaks, and Bristol yucca. Much of
the area appears to be disturbed fromo the construction of a camping area on top of the ridge.
A remnant of an old park road is present down the center of the ridge, with cleared areas
designated as camping sites denoted by small concrete foundations for park grills and outlet
housings. In addition to these park amenities, a single concrete water fountain was present at
the center of the eastern edge of the ridge. It is believed that the restroom facilities encountered
at 41BL1323 served these campgrounds. Surface visibility was poor due to the vegetation.
Soils encountered were of the Speck association.
Surface Assemblage
Although surface visibility of the site was poor, some artifacts were observed on the surface,
but they appear to be recent, possibly from a modern knapper creating flakes. Instances of
modern-day flintknappers at campsites around the area is not uncommon. Other parks around
the area have evidence of modern flintknapping occurring, and since this area was at one time
a camping ground, it is assumed that this has occurred here too.
Shovel Testing
In addition to inspection of the site’s surface, 13 shovel tests were excavated (Table 4-31).
All shovel tests were excavated along the ridge edges to avoid any disturbed areas. Of the 13
excavated shovel tests, nine tested positive for cultural material, containing a combined total of
206 artifacts. The majority of the artifacts (n = 185) were collected from two shovel tests (STs
8 and 9) excavated at the tip of the ridge. Most artifacts encountered (n=175) were located in
the upper 20 cm, while 29 were encountered at 20–40 cmbs, and only two were encountered at
40–60 cmbs. All shovel tests were terminated when clay, bedrock, large roots, or disturbances
were encountered.

Summary
Site 41BL1324 is a 260 x 4-m subsurface prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age.
Work consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 13 shovel tests. Surface inspection
revealed that the site was disturbed from the construction of a campsite that is no longer in
use. Shovel testing revealed that the majority of artifacts were encountered in the upper 40 cm
along the western and northern edge of the site. Distribution of the artifacts along the northern
and western edges of the finger ridge may be due from clearing the area for the campsite.

4.8.4

Site 41BL1337

Site 41BL1337 is a newly recorded, prehistoric rockshelter with an associated lithic scatter.
The site is located within a ridgetop and an inlet drainage. The vegetal setting of the ridgetop
consists of cedar, oak, cactus, yucca, and leaf litter. The vegetation of the inlet drainage consists
of leaf litter, cedar, oak, and greenbrier. The site is bounded by private property to the west,
Leona Park Road to the south, and a ridge to the west.
The rockshelter area of the site is located between two ridge slopes, 15 m above a small
intermittent drainage overlooking Belton Lake to the north. The shelter consists of two
chambers divided by a buildup of sediment deposits. The shelter measures approximately 35
across with an opening of 1.5 m and a depth of 10 m (Figure 4-75). Large, collapsed, limestone
overhangs line the front and sides of the shelter, trapping sediment (Figure 4-76). Of the two
chambers, only the western portion contains an artifact scatter. Artifacts consisted of flakes and
angular debris. Both chambers contained evidence of looting, with pits located inside and in
front of the shelter.
The lithic scatter portion of the site is located on the eastern finger ridge of the two ridge slopes
housing the shelter. Due to the dense vegetation on the ridgetop, no artifacts were observed on
the surface, but artifacts were encountered in the shovel tests. Shovel tests revealed that the site
is limited to the eastern and northern edge of the site. Soils of the site were of the Real-Rock
outcrop complex, which are typically shallow.

4.9	McGregor Park
Totaling 239 acres, the McGregor Park survey segment included eight acres of steep slopes.
The remaining 231 acres received 149 shovel tests, for a sampling density of 0.65 tests per
acre. Of these tests, 30 were positive, returning a rate of 20.1 percent ubiquity. Seven sites
were encountered during the survey of the McGregor Park segment. Three were previously
recorded, while the remaining four are newly recorded sites. One of the sites dates to the
historic period, while the other six fall within the unknown prehistoric period due to the overall
lack of diagnostic artifacts. Detailed results of each site are presented below.

4.9.1

Site 41BL1151 (Moffat Springs Site)

Site 41BL1151 was originally recorded in 2001 by Weber from the USACE, Fort Worth District,
during the inspection of the surface and existing potholes located in the area. The site is located
in McGregor Park and on private property at the base of a hill that extends to Moffat Springs
Creek. Although the site had not been officially recorded at the time of initial inspection, the
location of the site had been known by USACE resource management personnel and local
pothunters. The site was described as a large burned rock midden that extended approximately
275 m along the base of the bluff and measured approximately 12,500 m2 (Figure 4-77). At the
time of the initial investigation, 16.8 percent of the site was reported to have been destroyed
from looting. Artifacts present during the inspection of the surface and looter’s pits consisted
of flakes, cores, and fire-cracked rock.
In January of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited 41BL1151 to reassess the condition of the
site and its potential eligibility for recommendation to the NRHP. During these investigations,
archaeologists encountered the site in its reported location and noticed that the original
description of looting activities was correct, but more looting has occurred since that time.
Archaeologists noted that the area of looting measured approximately 200 x 30 m across the
entire terrace, destroying the portion of the site located on USACE property (Figure 4-78).
Furthermore, looters were present at the site during this investigation; they would leave when
EComm archaeologists arrived, and return after the site investigation. Looting continues
to be a serious problem despite the Park Host’s attempts to deter the activities. Despite the
large amount of disturbance from looting, EComm archaeologists conducted a 100 percent
pedestrian survey of the site and excavated shovel tests.

During inspection of the surface,
artifacts were similar to those
recorded during the original
investigations. Cultural material
consisted of flakes, cores, and
fire-cracked rock. The majority
of the artifacts were encountered
in the spoil piles of the looter’s
pits. Due to a large amount of
undergrowth and leaf litter,
artifacts on the surface of the
remainder of the site were not
observed.

In addition to the inspection
of the surface, eight shovel
tests were excavated. Only one
contained cultural material,
two flakes at 0–20 cmbs, and
one flake at 20–40 cmbs. All
shovel tests were terminated
either at bedrock (encountered
at depths between 20 and 40
cmbs), at clay (between 20 and
40 cmbs), or when dense gravels
were encountered (at 40 cmbs).
Based on termination depths of
the shovel tests, buried deposits
appear to be shallow.

In January of 2010, EComm
archaeologists
revisited
41BL1151 to reassess the
condition of the site and
its potential eligibility for
recommendation to the NRHP.
During these investigations,
archaeologists encountered the
site in its reported location and
noticed that the looting originally

described was even more extensive. Looting continues to be a serious problem despite the Park
Host’s attempts to deter the looters.
In the original site form, the recorders mentioned the possibility that the site has the potential
to contain a Paleoindian component. The likelihood of this is small. The primary component
to the site is an expansive burned rock midden terrace that is typical of the Archaic period. It
appears that these deposits rest atop bedrock and that there is no earlier component.

4.9.2

Site 41BL1152 (McGregor Park Site No. 1)

Site 41BL1152 was first recorded in 2001 by Weber of the USACE, Fort Worth District, during
a survey of McGregor Park. The site was described as an unknown prehistoric site consisting
of a buried terrace quarry located on a terrace between the Leon River and a small drainage that
empties into Moffat Spring Creek. The site measured approximately 12,500 m2 and consisted
of flaking debris, some of which had evidence of heating and thinning flakes (Figure 4-79).

In January of 2010, EComm
archaeologists
revisited
41BL1152 to reassess the
condition of the site and
its potential for eligibility
to the NRHP. During our
investigations, archaeologists
relocated the site based on
the original site descriptions.
However, the extent of the
cultural material is larger
than originally reported and
the level of disturbance has
increased since the initial
investigation (Figure 4-80).
The site was seen to extend
to the southwest and north
across Moffat Road. New
disturbances
observed
consisted of two-track road
cutting through the site
(north–south),
extensive
blading, and the dumping
of old campsite construction
materials. In order to
redocument the site a 100
percent pedestrian survey
accompanied with shovel
tests was employed.

Surface Assemblage
During the inspection of
the surface, artifacts were
observed on the surface,
but were thinly scattered
across the surface area and
were most visible in areas
where blading had occurred
or in areas with sparse of
vegetation. The cultural
material observed consisted
of several flakes and
numerous piece of angular
debris, all of which showed
evidence of heating.
Figure 4-80. Disturbance visible during the
crew’s delineation of 41BL1152.

Shovel Testing

Subsurface testing of the site consisted of the excavation of 23 shovel tests (Table 4-33). Of
the 23 shovel tests excavated, 11 were positive for cultural material. In total, 17 artifacts were
collected and consisted of one scraper, 14 flakes, and two pieces of angular debris. All shovel
tests were terminated when clay was reached (between 20 and 60 cmbs), when bedrock was
encountered (at 40 cmbs), when the test contained evidence of disturbance (between 20 and 40
cmbs), or when dense gravels were encountered (between 20 and 60 cmbs).

Summary
In January of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited 41BL1152 to reassess the condition of the
site and its potential for eligibility to the NRHP. The extent of the cultural material at 41BL1152
is more expansive and contains a higher level of disturbance than the initially recorded. During
EComm’s delineation, the site was extended to the southwest and north across Moffat Road. New
disturbances have partially destroyed the site and consist of two-track road cutting through the
site (north–south), extensive blading, and the dumping of old campsite construction materials.
The cultural material observed consisted of one scraper, several flakes, and numerous piece

Site 41BL1153

Site 41BL1153 was first
recorded by Weber of
the USACE, Fort Worth
District, during a 2001
survey of the area. The site
was recorded as a pre-1900
dam over Moffat Spring
Creek (see Figure 4-77). In
January of 2010, EComm
archaeologists
revisited
Figure 4-81. Historic dam at 41BL1153.
41BL1153 to reassess the
condition of the structure and
its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. The dam measures approximately 15 ft
long, stands 8 ft high, and is constructed of both cut and uncut limestone blocks capped by
random bricks, cinderblocks, and concrete (Figure 4-81). The dam appears to have been rebuilt
or modified at several points in time. Originally, it was probably built with just limestone
rocks that were either dry-stacked, or held together with lime-based mortar that has since
deteriorated. Subsequently, a concrete retaining wall was added to one side of the dam. This
was made using board forms, suggesting that construction of that portion may have occurred
prior to World War II, when plywood began to became commonly available. More recently, the
stone portion of the dam was capped with concrete cinderblocks, scrap bricks, and a layer of
concrete. Two of the bricks have “Groesbeck” on the face. Further investigation conduced by
EComm consisted of archival research of the area.
Archival Research
Site 41BL1153 is situated near the town of Moffat on the third-class headright survey granted
to John Weintz by the State of Texas in 1848. By 1857, Amelia Moffet owned a number of
acres in this area and began selling them. In 1860, she sold Calista Wiswell 65.5 acres of
the Weintz and Moore Surveys (Table 4-34). She in turn began to subdivide this property,
selling it off as town lots, thus spurring the growth of Moffat. The Bell County Clerk’s deed
indices are not sufficiently detailed to determine which of the many properties Wiswell sold is
the one containing the dam across Moffat Spring Branch, without reviewing the abstract for
every transaction. Consequently, there is a gap in the research for the property containing site
41BL1153 between the years of 1860 and 1895. By 1895, the property was owned by H. A.
Spoontz, who was a resident of Moffat in 1880. He is listed in the 1880 census as a 30-year old
farmer living with his wife and their five children. In 1895, he sold seven acres in the Weintz
survey to Thomas E. Hamilton (BCDL 192/20), who moved on to the property. Hamilton is
listed in the 1900 and 1910 censuses as a widower living with his single daughter Roxie and

her son Vennie in Moffat, along the Moffat Road. When Thomas Hamilton died, his oldest son
R. E. Hamilton came into possession of the property. R. E. Hamilton resided in New Mexico,
and he deeded the property to his sister Roxie (BCDL 329/540), who on the same day deeded
it to her son Vennie (329/538). Vennie also appears in the 1930 census for Bell County, though
at a different location. By 1930, he had sold the property to W. B. Wilson (BCDR 364/434).
The Wilson family probably never occupied this property. There is no W. B. Wilson listed for
Bell County in the 1920 or 1930 census. When the Wilson family sold this property to Herbert
Brown in 1929, it was a sale on the part of multiple heirs (BCDR 408/357). The same sale
was later rerecorded in 1937, when an N. I. Wilson, an heir not included in the original sale,
confirmed the original transaction (BCDR 457/182). Herbert Brown then sold the land to Artie
Campo, who then sold it to A. L. Brown in 1950 (BCDR 618/68).
Based on the background research, it is not possible to determine when or who built the dam
across Moffat Spring Branch. None of the deed records examined mention a dam, nor do
they mention spring or creek as part of the property description. Census records are also of
little help, since none of them provide any clues as to who or why a dam would have been
constructed at this location. It is possible that the dam was built by property owners on the
south side of the creek. Parcel details about properties on the south side of the creek were not
available from the USACE, and therefore, those properties could not be researched.
Summary
The site was recorded as a pre-1900 dam over Moffat Spring Creek. The dam measures
approximately 15 ft long, stands 8 ft high (see Figure 4-81), and is constructed of both cut and
uncut limestone blocks capped by random bricks, cinderblocks, and concrete. In January of
2010, EComm archaeologists revisited 41BL1153 to reassess the condition of the structure and
its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. During our visit, the dam remains in the
154

same condition as it was during its initial recordation. The dam appears to have been rebuilt or
modified at several points in time. Based on the archival background research, it is not possible
to determine when or who built the dam across Moffat Spring Branch.

Site 41BL1313

Site 41BL1313 is a 400 x 300-m prehistoric campsite/procurement site of undetermined age
(Figure 4-82). The site is situated on a broad upland terrace overlooking Belton Lake to the
north and west. The site is located on both a model airplane course and undeveloped land,
and is bounded to the north and east by private property. The terrace is composed of Riesel
gravelly soils, Menard soils, moderately eroded, and Bastsil fine sandy loams. All three soil
types encountered at the site are deep and contained cultural materials extending to a depth
of 100 cmbs. Vegetation observed at the site consisted of cedar elm, juniper, post oak, oak,
mesquite, greenbrier, short grasses, and prickly pear. Visibility of the site is approximately 20
percent.

Inspection of the site consisted
of a 100 percent pedestrian
survey accompanied by
shovel testing along 30-m
transects. The site was
first encountered at the
northernmost portion of the
site by a high-density scatter
of lithic material. Cultural
material was present both in
situ and in discard piles from
looters (Figure 4-83). During
the inspection, 15 looter’s pits
were observed that measured
from 1 x 2 m to 4 x 5 m, with
depths ranging from 50 to
100 cmbs. According to the
Park Host, looting is common
at this location, especially
after heavy rains. Evidence
proves this to be true, but
only the area along the edge
of the terrace was targeted
for looting. Despite the
looting activities present at
the site and disturbance from

Cultural material visible on
the surface of the site was
primarily located on the
northern edge of the site near
Belton Lake. In this area,
soils have been eroded due
to environmental processes,
and a high-density lithic
scatter was exposed. Cultural
materials observed consisted
of numerous flakes, bifaces,
fire-cracked rock, cores,
tools, and angular debris.

Shovel Testing
In addition to inspection of the site’s surface, 19 shovel tests were excavated, yielding 235
artifacts from 14 shovel tests (Table 4-35). Of the 235 artifacts collected, 97 were collected from
0 to 20 cmbs, 59 from 20 to 40 cmbs, 45 from 40 to 60 cmbs, 31 from 60 to 80, and three from
80 to 100 cmbs. These consisted of one biface, flakes, angular debris, glass, and whiteware.
Both the glass and whiteware were collected from the upper 20 cm and were encountered in
shovel tests near a campsite and a dump pile. Nevertheless, shovel testing revealed that cultural
materials are well stratified down to 100 cmbs. Of the 19 shovel tests excavated, only five
encountered bedrock or clay; these were located along the edge of the terrace where the soils
were shallow. In other areas of the site, soils are deep and have cultural integrity.
Summary
41BL1313 is a 400 x 300-m prehistoric campsite/procurement site of undetermined age.
Work conducted at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 19 shovel tests.
Inspection of the site’s surface revealed that the site had been looted over the past decade.
Evidence of looting activities were looter’s pits and discarded artifact piles; however, these
activities were minimal and did not fully impact the site. Shovel testing revealed that the site
contained buried deposits down to 100 cmbs, and they appear to be intact.

1,300 x 700 m, following the relic floodplain of the Leon River in a northeast–southwest
orientation. The site is disturbed due to construction of park roads, campsites, associated
structures, clearing of vegetation, and telephone pole installment. The site is severely constricted
by these disturbances and has potentially lost the majority of its intact cultural deposits. Soils
encountered at the site consist of Riesel gravelly soils. Vegetation remaining on the site is
secondary and consists mostly of young oak trees and thick clumps of greenbrier with mixed
with various bunch grasses. Surface visibility is 30 percent.
Surface Assemblage
Although visibility at the site was poor due to thick bunches of various grasses, artifacts were
visible along the road side and in areas where vegetation was sparse. Artifacts consisted mostly
of flakes and angular debris. No diagnostic material was observed.
Shovel Testing
In addition to a pedestrian survey of the area, nine shovel tests were excavated and yielded
seven artifacts. Four artifacts were found in the upper 20 cm of the site, while only three
were encountered between 20 and 40 cmbs. Artifacts collected consisted of five flakes, one
hammerstone fragment, and one piece of angular debris.

shovel tests. Surface inspection revealed that the site had been disturbed from construction
of park roads, campsites, associated structures, clearing of vegetation, and telephone pole
installment. Shovel testing reveled that the site contains an ephemeral deposit of cultural
material within the upper 40 cm. Due to disturbance at the site, it is not known how much
remains intact.

4.9.6

Site 41BL1315

630 Feet

Site 41BL1315 is a 140 x 135, prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. The site is located
in the mid and toe slope of a gently sloping landform bisected by a small unnamed drainage. The
landform originates outside of USACE property and gently slopes to the west toward a low-lying
wetland. Only a small portion of the landform was available for survey due to the proximity
of private property (Figure 4-84). South of the bisecting drainage, the ground is mostly level
with a very slight slope to the west. The unnamed drainage to the north and Moffat Road to the
south constrict the southern
section of the site. The soils
are composed of the EckrantRock outcrop complex and
Crawford silty clays. The
amount and size of gravel
increases with depth, as does
the compactness of the soils.
The drainage that bisects the
site and the landform has
banks approximately three
feet high. It appears that the
41BL1315
water might only spill over its
banks on very rare occasions.
As the drainage flows into
the low-lying wetland, it
loses its banks and fans out in
several directions. Due to the
modification of the landform
south of the site straddling
Moffat Road, there are

pooling or major disturbance. Based on the amount of
artifacts in the shoulder of the road, it appears Moffat
Road may have removed a high-density portion of
the site. Two 5 x 5-m dogleashes were placed along an exposed area of the site that contained
moderate to high concentrations of surface artifacts (Table 4-36). Artifacts within the dogleash
were recorded in exposed areas of the site.
Shovel Testing
In addition to a pedestrian survey of the site’s surface, eight shovel tests were excavated, one
of which yielded a single flake. The flake was encountered in the upper 20 cm of the site. All
shovel tests were terminated at clay, which varied in depth from 40 to 60 cmbs. Although
several negative shovel tests were excavated south of Moffat Road, the true extent of the
site remains unclear due to project area restrictions and the removal of artifacts near and in
Moffat Road. During the delineation of the site, signs of erosion and deflation were observed
after a hard rain. It was noted that within direct proximity to the USACE property line, the
concentration of artifacts increased, which indicates that a large portion of the site may be
located within private property.
Summary
41BL1315 is a 140 x 135, prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work conducted at the
site included a pedestrian survey, inventory of two dogleashes, and excavation of eight shovel
tests. Artifacts recorded within the dogleashes were encountered in eroded areas and appear to
be in secondary context due to the disturbances of road construction. Shovel testing revealed
that the site to have generally shallow deposits of soils ranging from 40 to 60 cm over clay,
with very few artifacts recorded.

Site 41BL1316

Site 41BL1316 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age, measuring 70 x 40 m
(Figure 4-85). The site is located on a midslope terrace of a north–south running finger ridge
that overlooks the confluence of two unnamed drainages. The grounds surface of the terrace
gently slopes toward the confluence. Away from the terrace and further upslope, limestone
rocks and bedrock slabs are eroding out. The landform has rapidly ascending slopes that elevate

the site about 15–20 ft above the
drainages. The drainages are both
spring fed and have a steady flow
of water year round. Although
the landform is relatively level,
it is very constricted by steep
slopes. The soils are composed
of Real-Rock outcrop complex
and consist of shallow gravelly
clay loam underlain by bedrock.
Slightly deeper soils were noted
along the edge of the terrace
closest to the drainages, while
very shallow bedrock was
encountered on the south edge of
the site. The vegetation is cedar
with a few live oaks and a large
amount of deadfall. Surface
visibility is 30 percent.

Surface Assemblage
The site’s artifact accumulation
is very low, consisting of an

Given that the soils are shallow

4.10	Owl Creek
The Owl Creek survey segment totaled 960 acres. About 106 acres consisted of steep slopes,
which were excluded from shovel testing. The remaining 854 acres were investigated using
458 shovel tests for a sampling density of 0.54 tests per acre. Of these tests, 45 were positive
returning a rate of 9.8 percent ubiquity. Twelve sites were encountered within the Owl Creek
segment. Four were previously recorded, while the remaining eight were newly discovered.
Due to the overall lack of diagnostic artifacts, all fall within the unknown prehistoric period.
While the four previously recorded sites within the Owl Creek parcel are on USACE property,
the Fort Hood Cultural Resource Management branch manages the sites on a day to day basis
(Richard S. Jones, personal communication 2010). Detailed results for all 12 sites are presented
below.

4.10.1 Site 41BL136
Site 41BL136 was originally recorded by the Fort Hood Archaeological Society in 1972 by
Parachini. The site was described as an occupation site with a centrally located burned rock
midden feature that has been potted through looting activities. The site is situated on the Owl
Creek floodplain at the base of a cliff covered with various scrub brush and cedar. Investigators
examined the profiles of some of the looter’s pits, which extended to a depth of 107 cmbs, and
in some cases and noted that intensification of cultural material began at a depth of 80 cmbs
and continued to a depth of 107 cmbs. Due to a large quantity of cultural material at the base
of the pit, investigators determined that the looters never reached a sterile layer of the site,
indicating that intact buried cultural deposits may extend well past 110 cmbs. In addition to
the inspection of the looter’s pits, an examination of the surface was also conducted. Several
cultural materials associated with the site were observed on the surface. The cultural material
observed on the surface consisted of manos, metates, scrapers, lithic debitage, spalls, and
Archaic-aged projectile points. Based on the Archaic-aged projectile points present at the site,
investigators determined that 41BL136 had an unknown Archaic cultural affiliation.
Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL136 in January of 2010 to reassess the condition
of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. At the time of our revisit
of, the cultural material appeared in the same condition as when initially recorded in 1972.
The central feature of the site is a heavily looted burned rock midden that rises above the
ground’s surface by approximately 30 cm (Figure 4-86). Despite the looted nature of the site,
archaeologists further examined the site by survey and shovel testing.
Surface Assemblage
Inspection of the site consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey to determine the horizontal
extent of the site. Numerous artifacts were observed on the surface and consisted of angular
debris, flakes both worked and unworked, unifacial tools, biface fragments, fire-cracked rock,
and mussel shell. Due to looting of the midden feature a majority of the artifacts were observed
grouped and scattered about in close proximity to the feature. Artifact concentrations become
sparser as distance from the feature increases. No diagnostic artifacts were observed.

Summary
During January of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited the site to reassess the condition of
the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. During our investigation of the
site, the cultural material appeared in the same condition as when initially recorded in 1972. The
central feature of the site is a heavily looted burned rock midden that rises above the ground’s
surface by approximately 30 cm. One shovel test did encounter an ephemeral, subsurface
portion of the burned rock midden feature from approximately 20 to 40 cmbs. Beneath the
fire-cracked rock lens, only a few flakes were recovered from the next approximate 10 cm. Due
to the lack of diagnostic observed or encountered during our visit the original determination
162

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

of the site as having an unknown Archaic
affiliation remains the same.

4.10.2 Site 41BL137
Site 41BL137 was originally recorded in
1972 by Coon during a survey by the Fort
Hood Archaeological Society. The site was
originally described as a specific activity
site for food processing. The site is located
on a bluff measuring approximately 10 m in
height overlooking Owl Creek to the south.
At the time of the original visit, investigators
only conducted a surface inspection of the
site, noting that no looting had occurred,
and that the only disturbance was at the
southern edge caused by erosion. Cultural
material observed during the time of their
survey consisted of an abundant amount of
lithic material consisting of cores, choppers,
blades, hammer stones, and one unidentified
projectile point. Due to the lack of diagnostic
artifacts, the site was assigned an unknown
prehistoric cultural affiliation.

Figure 4-87. Ephemeral edge of
burned rock midden at 41BL136.

In January of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited 41BL137 to reassess the condition of the
site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP (Figure 4-88). During our visit it
was discovered that the artifact assemblage recorded during the original visit of 41BL137 was
consistent to what is presently on the surface. No looting has occurred since the original visit to
the site and a large portion of the site remains moderately intact. As originally noted, the water
flow of Owl Creek has cut a portion of the site away and formed a steep cutbank. Topography
easily defines the site boundary to the east and west; however, the USACE property line
limited full delineation of the site. Despite the limited surface area available for delineation,
archaeologists conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey with intensive shovel testing.
Surface Assemblage
Surface inspection of the site was conducted in an area that is bounded by a private property
fenceline to the north and the termination of the landform to the south. During the survey,
archaeologists encountered the same surface scatter as originally documented in 1972. The
surface assemblage consists of cores, numerous flakes worked and unworked, bifaces both
complete and broken, and unifacial tools. The total number of artifacts observed on the surface
numbers into the thousands. No diagnostic artifacts were encountered.

In addition to the examination
of the surface, seven shovel

of which were positive. Ten
artifacts were recovered
from the two shovel tests and
consisted of nine flakes and
one piece of angular debris.
Based on shovel test data, the
thickness of soils is variable
across the landscape. Four
of the shovel tests were
terminated at a depth of 80

presently on the surface. No
looting has occurred since
the original visit to the site
and a large portion of the site remains moderately intact. Artifacts are located beneath and
on the ground’s surface, including: angular debris, flakes, cores, bifaces, and unifacial tools.
Although topography defines several boundaries of the site, a full delineation was impossible
due to the proximity of private property. No diagnostic artifacts were observed or encountered
during or investigations, therefore the as the originally designated the site remains to have an
unknown cultural affiliation.

4.10.3 Site 41BL899
Site 41BL899 was originally recorded by Rotunno and Mesrobian in 1986 during a survey for
Fort Hood. The site was described as a burned rock midden site located on a bench overlooking
Owl Creek to the north (Figure 4-89).

164

United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

During January of 2010, EComm
archaeologists revisited 41BL899
to reassess the condition of
the site and its potential for
nomination to the NRHP. When
surveying this area, confusion
regarding USACE and Fort Hood
property boundaries precluded
the crew from inspecting
portions of 41BL899 As a result,
the burned rock midden on a
terrace south of Owl Creek was
not revisited, but the scatter of
eroded artifacts, down slope,
were recorded. The previous
survey forms do not mention the
eroded artifacts in Owl Creek
(Figure 4-90). Two artifact types
(mano and refined biface frags)
recorded during our delineation
contain characteristics that
would associate them to a site
that is occupied for longer
periods, i.e., burned rock midden
construction/utilization.
The
portion of 41BL899 within Owl
Creek is not significant, but
indicates what type of artifacts
may be present in the site today.
No datum was reestablished
because the crew was not able
to reach the given coordinates
of the original datum. Following
completion of field work,
EComm was informed that Fort
Hood has assumed management
responsibility for many of the
archaeological sites in the Owl
Creek area, including 41BL899.

and rerecord the condition
of cultural material at a give
site. According to the original site form, our survey would have had access to the very northern
portion of the site. However, six negative shovel tests were excavated north of the barbed wire
fence that splits the site and no artifacts were observed on the surface. If the site is present
here, it is extremely ephemeral and non-significant. This does not mean 41BL900 does not
exist, but simply means our efforts were unable to relocate the site within our survey area.
No datum was reestablished because the crew was not able to reach the given coordinates
of the original datum because of unclear property lines. Following completion of field work,
EComm was informed that Fort Hood has assumed management responsibility for many of the

so expansive, all types of
artifact densities are present.
Although the terrace setting is well suited for long term occupation, no scattering of firecracked rock or thermal features were observed. As well, no concentrated amounts of heat
treated artifacts were observed that would indicate some form of mass thermal alteration.
Based on the artifacts observed, the site represents a large procurement scatter.

Surface Assemblage
Primarily, the site is composed of moderate to high-density clusters that are connected by
a continuous low-density scatter. The most refined tools are present within the high-density
clusters. In order to get a better idea of cultural material scattered across the surface of the entire
site, seven controlled surface inventories were conducted along exposed areas of the hillside
and level surfaces that contained moderate to high concentrations of artifacts (Table 4-37). All
artifacts were made from chert. Artifacts within the surface inventories were recorded on or
near steep slopes and are therefore considered secondary in context.

Shovel Testing
In addition to the pedestrian survey of the site’s surface, 51 shovel tests were excavated (Table
4-38). Of the 51 shovel tests excavated 12 were positive for cultural material. Nineteen artifacts
were collected within the upper 20 cm of the site. The cultural material collected consisted of
five edge-modified flakes, 10 unmodified flakes, and four pieces of angular debris. All shovel
tests encountered bedrock at depths between 20 and 60 cmbs. Cultural material collected from
the shovel tests are considered to be in secondary context due to erosion.
Summary
41BL1306 is a newly recorded, prehistoric procurement/lithic scatter of undetermined age.
Work performed included a 100 percent pedestrian survey, an inventory of seven 5 x 5-m surface
inventories, and excavation of 51 shovel tests. The majority of artifacts observed at the site are
located on heavily eroded soils on bedrock along the slope and level areas of the site and are
thus in a secondary context. Shovel testing revealed a subsurface scatter of cultural material in
the upper 20 cm of the site; however, steep slopes have eroded artifacts down the hillsides and
they are therefore considered to be in secondary context. Shovel testing revealed that soils are
generally shallow ranging from 20 to 60 cm over bedrock with few artifacts recorded.

4.10.6 Site 41BL1308
Site 41BL1308 is a prehistoric
open campsite of a undetermined
age that measures approximately
280 x 80 m (Figure 4-93). The
site is located on a quaternary
alluvial T-2 terrace overlooking
Owl Creek to the south (Figure
4-94). The landform rises
approximately 10 ft above
T-1 terrace. The T-1 terrace is
approximately 50 m wide. The
landform the site is located on
is an east–west running terrace,
which expands out from private
property. In the T-2 terrace
there is a high degree of surface
visibility, approximately 80
percent, with cedar and the
occasional cacti or bunch grass
impeding view of the ground. The
soils within the site range from
approximately 20 to 50 cmbs
and are composed of soils from
the Lewisville-Altoga complex
consisting of a silty loam with
limestone cobbles covering the
ground’s surface. The terrace is
relatively level up to the extreme
margins of the landform.

Surface Assemblage
The site is composed of a

widespread across the terrace.
There are several pockets in the
site that contain even higher
artifact concentrations. These
denser areas are all located

densities off of the site’s landform drastically drop. The very low-density artifact scatter on the
transition between the T-2 and T-1 terraces is the result of colluvial erosion. Once onto the T-1
terrace, no artifacts are present. Where the pockets of high-density concentrations are located,
there is also a low to moderate scatter of fire-cracked rock and heat-treated/fire-popped chert.
One dogleash inventory was placed along an exposed area on top of the knoll that contained
moderate to high concentrations of surface artifacts. Artifacts within the dogleash were recorded
on exposed bedrock and are therefore in a secondary context. Two edge-modified flakes, two
bifaces, one core, 11 complete flakes, and 15 incomplete flakes were collected in the dogleash
inventory. All were chert. Some of the edge-modified flakes, complete flakes, and incomplete
flakes showed evidence of heating.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the inspection of the site’s surface, six shove tests were excavated, yielding only
three flakes out of two shovel tests. The artifacts were encountered in the upper 20 cm of the
site. Of the six shovel tests, excavated three encountered bedrock between 20 and 40 cmbs, one
encountered clay at 60 cmbs, and one was excavated to a depth of 80 cmbs.
Summary
41BL1308 is a prehistoric open campsite of a undetermined age that measures approximately
280 x 80 m. Work performed at the site consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey, an
inventory of a 5 x 5-m dogleash, and the excavation of six shovel tests. The majority of artifacts
observed at the site are located on heavily eroded soils on bedrock and are thus in a secondary
context. Shovel testing revealed the site to have very few buried cultural materials to a depth
of 20 cmbs.

4.10.7 Site 41BL1310
Site 41BL1310 is a 500 x 140-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age (Figure 4-95).
The site is situated in a series of high limestone outcrops overlooking unnamed drainages to
the east and west, as well as Owl Creek to the south. Due to the lack of vegetation and the
steepness of the slopes, the soil and sediment within the site are eroding away and exposing
large limestone boulders and bedrock benches (Figure 4-96). Where soils are present, they
are composed of soils of the Real-Rock outcrop complex and Purves association, which are
commonly shallow mollisols, approximately 10–20 cm thick. A large percentage of the site
occupies a midslope terrace that is moderately level with few undulating areas due to erosion.
The vegetation is mostly cedar with few live oaks. The undergrowth is very open containing
little to no grass, few shrubs, and occasionally dense patches of leaf litter. Surface visibility
is 75 percent. Based on the topographic setting, it appears the majority of the recorded site is
deflated and possibly located outside of USACE property.

The site has a low to moderate
surface scatter of lithic artifacts
primarily indicating early stage
reduction processes. However, it
is possible that differing activities
were occurring in separate
portions of the site. High up on
the ridgeline, inhabitants were
taking advantage of naturally
eroding chert cobbles for lithic
procurement.
Conversely,
evidence from the broad
midslope terrace, in the eastern
portion of the site, indicates that
inhabitants were occupying this
area longer and further reducing
there procured tools. Within the
terrace, there are several clusters
of highly concentrated lithic
scatters. Unlike concentrations
observed higher up on the
landforms, these clusters contain
a higher amount of fire popped
chert and an incipient scatter of
fire-cracked rock. However, the
majority of the site is located on
steep slopes and apexes of the
ridgeline. Since a large portion
of the site is situated on and
around steep sloped landforms,
the continuous scatter of artifacts
spans over 40 ft in elevation.

five were positive for cultural
material. Ten artifacts were
encountered within the upper 20 cm of the shovel tests and consisted of seven pieces of angular

bedrock at depths ranging between 20 and 60 cmbs.
Summary
41BL1310 is a 500 x 140-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work performed at
the site consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey, an inventory of three 5 x 5-m controlled
surface inventories, and the excavation of 18 shovel tests. The majority of artifacts observed
at the site are located on heavily eroded soils on bedrock and are thus in a secondary context.
A perfect example of the artifacts being in a secondary context is the presence of an Early
Triangular point, which fits into the Early Archaic period in Central Texas. Shovel testing
revealed the site to have few buried cultural materials to a depth of 20 cmbs, and that the soils
at the site are generally shallow ranging in depth from 20 to 60 cmbs.

Site 41BL1311 is a 750 x 250-m
prehistoric campsite of an
undetermined age (Figure
4-98). The site is located on a
quaternary alluvial T-2 terrace
overlooking Owl Creek to
the south. The landform rises
approximately 10 ft above
T-1 terrace. The T-1 terrace
bordering the site ranges
from approximately 25 to
75 m wide. The landform
on which the site is located
on is an east–west running
terrace, which expands out
from private property. In the
T-2 terrace there is a high
degree of surface visibility
with cedar and the occasional
cacti or bunch grass impeding
view of the ground. The soils
within the site range from
approximately 30 to 80+ cmbs
and consist of clay loam Speck
soils with limestone cobbles
covering the ground’s surface.

Surface Assemblage
The surface assemblage is composed of a moderatedensity surface scatter of lithic artifacts that is
widespread across the terrace. Numerous pockets in
the site contain even higher artifact concentrations.
Although the distribution of artifacts extends across
the landform, a variation in cultural material was noted
between several portions of the site. The western and
central portion of the site, which extends nearly to the
first two-track road, contains an artifact assemblage that
reflects finishing stages of lithic reduction and pockets of
light fire-cracked rock scatters. In this location a base of
a Pedernales point was encountered (Figure 4-99). Just
west of the first two-track road the artifacts represent
procurement activities, in particular, core reduction.

Results

Where the procurement activity was noted, the surface contains a very dense scattering of
chert nodules that have eroded out. Amongst the chert nodules are numerous cores and early
stage debitage. This type of scatter persists further to the east and past the second two-track.
As the landform fades into the Owl Creek T-1 terrace, artifact densities drastically drop. The
very low-density artifact scatter on the transition between the T-2 and T-1 terraces is the result
of colluvial erosion. Once onto the T-1 terrace and away from the alluvial terrace, no artifacts
are present.

Summary
41BL1311 is a 750 x 250-m prehistoric campsite of an undetermined age. Work performed
at the site consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey and excavation of 27 shovel tests.
Inspection of the site’s surface revealed that specific artifacts types are located in different
areas of the site. Shovel testing revealed two buried components, one between 0 and 20 cmbs
and one between 40 and 80 cmbs; however, very few artifacts were recovered from these two
components.

4.10.9 Site 41BL1312
Site 41BL1312 is a subsurface prehistoric ephemeral lithic scatter of undetermined age and
measures approximately 25 x 15 m (Figure 4-100). The site is located on the toe slope of a
long northwest–southeast running ridgeline approximately 500 m west of Owl Creek. Unlike
the rest of the ridgeline, which has a very abrupt transition from slope to floodplain the site is
located in a gently sloping toe slope that maintains a general width of approximately 30 x 60 m.
To the west of the site is a broad floodplain for the confluence of Owl Creek and Leon River.
The ground’s surface within the site is gently sloping toward the floodplain and is composed
of Speck soils. The site appears to be located on a very isolated alluvial deposit because clayey
and rocky soils with shallow bedrock are present just outside of positive shovel tests. Live

Due to poor visibility
of the area, the site was
encountered on transect
during shovel testing of the
area, once the area proved to
be positive, additional tests
were excavated. In total, 13
shovel tests were excavated,
only one of which yielded
artifacts. One flake was
collected from the upper
20 cm and one from 20 to
40 cmbs. All shovel tests
were terminated either at a
depth of 80 cmbs, when clay
was encountered, or when
bedrock was encountered.

4.10.10 Site 41BL1320
Site 41BL1320 is a 125 x 70-m prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age (Figure 4-101).
The site is located on a high terrace overlooking Methegline Creek to west. Delineation of the
site relied primarily on topography and USACE property lines. The soils encountered within
the site are composed of Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex soils, which are shallow and consist
of cobbly silty clay underlain by bedrock at a about 15 cmbs. The vegetation is dominated by a
thick mix of cedar and juniper, which have created a layer of leaf litter on the ground’s surface.
Surface visibility is 50 percent.

Shovel Testing

In addition to the inspection of the site’s
surface, 11 shovel tests were excavated,
yielding 14 artifacts out of five shovel tests (Table 4-43). The 14 artifacts consisted of one
flake and 13 pieces of angular debris and were collected from the upper 20 cm. Bedrock was

encountered in all shovel tests
at depths between 20 and 40
cmbs.
Summary
41BL1320 is a 125 x 70-m
prehistoric lithic scatter of
an undetermined age. Work
conducted at the site consisted
of a pedestrian survey, three
5 x 5-m controlled surface
inventories, and excavation
of 11 shovel tests. Within the
three surface inventories, four
Darl points were encountered,
but they were on exposed
bedrock and are considered
to be in a secondary context.
Shovel

revealed
deposits of soil ranging from
20 to 40 cmbs over bedrock
with few artifacts recorded.

4.10.11 Site 41BL1321

Site 41BL1321 is a 450 x 75-m
prehistoric lithic scatter of
an undetermined age (see Figure 4-101). The site is located on a terrace overlooking two
intermittent drainages. The soils encountered within the site are composed of soils of the
Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex, which are typically cobbly silty clay soils underlain by
bedrock about 30 cmbs. The vegetation of the site is dominated by a thick mix of cedar and
juniper, which have created a thick layer of leaf litter on the ground’s surface allowing for 50
percent of surface visibility. The delineation of the site relied primarily on topography and
USACE property lines.

Results

Surface Assemblage
Within the site, there is a continuous distribution
of moderately dense lithic artifacts, which span
along the terrace. During the delineation of the
site, six high-density artifact concentrations
were identified. Of the six artifact concentrations
identified, surface inventories of two
concentrations were conducted. Inventories of
the areas consisted of controlled 5 x 5-m surface
inventories (Table 4-44). The artifacts observed
within the controlled surface inventories were
recorded on top of bedrock and are therefore
in a secondary palimpsest context. Some of the
artifacts observed contained evidence of heating.

Shovel Testing
In addition to the inspection of the site’s surface, 12 shovel tests were excavated, yielding five
artifacts, four of which came from the upper 20 cm, while one was encountered between 40
and 60 cmbs. All artifacts collected were flakes. Termination of the shovel tests varied, three
were terminated at bedrock encountered between 20 and 40 cmbs, one was excavated to a
depth of 80 cmbs, and seven encountered clay between 20 and 60 cmbs.
Summary
41BL1321 is a 450 x 75-m prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age. The site is located
on a terrace overlooking two intermittent drainages. Work conducted at the site consisted of
a pedestrian survey, two 5 x 5-m controlled surface inventories, and excavation of 12 shovel
tests. The artifacts observed within the surface inventories were recorded on top of bedrock
and are therefore in a secondary palimpsest context. Shovel testing revealed deposits of soil
ranging from 20 to 60 cm in thickness over bedrock with few artifacts recorded.

4.10.12 Site 41BL1346
Site 41BL1346 is an isolated subsurface prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age, which
measures approximately 15 x 15 m (Figure 4-103). The site is located on the toe slope of a long
north–south running finger ridge approximately 400 m north of Flint Creek. Due to the sites
low-lying geographic location and proximity to Flint Creek, the cultural material lays within
a Krum silty clay matrix, which is derived from Pleistocene alluvial aggradations deposited
onto stream terraces. The ground’s surface in 41BL1346 gradually slopes toward Flint Creek.
South, out of the site’s boundary, the surface slowly levels out and eventually culminating
into Flint Creek’s T-1 terrace. Although the site is located in a widespread topographical
setting, cultural deposits appear very sporadic and isolated. Primary vegetative cover has been
drastically affected by modern agricultural clearing of the land and consists of few cedar trees
with mixed short grasses. Surface visibility is variable between 20 percent.

Shovel Testing
Due to the subsurface
nature of the accumulated
cultural material, 41BL1346
was discovered during on
transect shovel testing of
the survey area. Once the
presence of cultural material
was confirmed, six additional
shovel tests were excavated
surrounding the known
positive.
These
shovel
tests contained no cultural
material and were terminated
due to high clay content at
approximately 65 cmbs or
high density of subsurface
gravel at approximately 20
cmbs. Based on the single
positive shovel test, it was
determined the isolated
accumulation of cultural
material was present between
10 and 40 cmbs.

was determined that the site contained a very isolated subsurface scatter of lithic debitage.

4.10.13 Isolated Occurrences
Five isolated occurrences were in the Owl Creek survey segment. Each of these consisted of
a positive shovel test containing no more than two artifacts and with no other positive shovel
tests nearby. The coordinates of these isolated positive tests were logged but they were not
further investigated.

Totaling 245 acres, the Jubilee Springs survey segment included 133 acres of steep slopes,
which were excluded from shovel testing. The remaining 112 acres included approximately 40
acres along the shoreline of Belton Lake, which could not be tested. The 24 tests in the segment
yielded a sampling density of 0.21 tests per acres. None of these 24 tests were positive, and no
sites were encountered within the Jubilee Springs survey segment.

4.12	Cedar Ridge Park
Totaling 321 acres, the Cedar Ridge Park survey segment also included about 30 acres of steep
slopes where shovel testing was not conducted. The remaining 291 acres was investigated using
155 shovel tests for a sampling density of 0.53 tests per acre. Of these tests, 29 were positive,
returning a rate of 18.7 percent ubiquity. During the survey of the Cedar Ridge Park segment,
15 sites were encountered. Of these, seven were previously recorded while eight sites are
newly discovered. No cultural material was encountered at previously recorded site 41BL13
and previously recorded site 41BL79 was found to have been destroyed. The remaining 13
sites fall within the unknown prehistoric period due to the overall lack of diagnostic artifacts.
Detailed results for each site are presented below, in site number order.

4.12.1 Site 41BL13
Site 41BL13 was originally encountered and recorded in 1949 by Stephenson during the
National Park Service River Basin Survey. The site was described as a rockshelter located on
the southern canyon wall over looking Cedar Creek. At the time of recordation, Stephenson
noted that the site had been completely destroyed by pot hunters who removed all cultural
material. Nonetheless Stephenson recorded the site as a rockshelter measuring 40 x 15 x 12 ft.
During our survey of the area a rockshelter fitting the description of the location and
dimensions of 41BL13 was relocated. No cultural material was observed on the surface during
our investigations and due to the current conditions of the area any cultural material that may
have remained after the looters destroyed the site was likely removed by water and wave action
during high lake level periods. Furthermore no shovel tests were excavated due to the lack of
soils and water conditions. Currently the shelter is devoid of any cultural material and is no
longer considered an archaeological site.

4.12.2 Site 41BL22 (The Garth Site/Castro Site)
Site 41BL22 (Figure 4-104) was originally documented in 1960 by Jelks during the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project. The site was described as an open occupation area with three
burned rock middens. The site was recorded as occupying an area measuring two or more areas
between the creek channel of Cedar Creek and a limestone bluff with some of the occupation
area extending on to the bluff. The condition of the site during its original visit consisted
of numerous pot holes with midden deposits reaching a depth of 3–4 ft. Although the site
appeared to be disturbed during the original visit, the recorder noted that some areas of the
site had not been disturbed. Artifacts observed during the initial visit of the site consisted of
two blades, one hammerstone, and numerous points such as Perdiz, Scallorn, Clifton, Young,
Fresno, Darl, Ensor, Yarbrough, and Pedernales. In addition to lithic material observed, pottery
was also noted.
In the winter of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited 41BL22 to reassess the current condition
of the site and to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. During our visit the lake
had recently flooded and the water level had covered a majority of 41BL22 within USACE

property (Figure 4-105). Despite
the flood waters covering a
portion of the site, archaeologists
were able to verify that the site
was still present. However, due
to the looting activities that have
occurred over several decades,
the condition of the site is poor.

Feature Area

The site is located on a high
limestone terrace that is level
with Belton Lake surrounded
by limestone escarpments to the
east, west, and south. The terrace
has a slope that is less than 5
percent with soils varying from
0–1 m according to stratigraphy
seen in the looter’s pits. Soils
encountered during our survey
of the area were composed of
mollisols from the EckrantRock outcrop complex and the
surface visibility of the site was
50 percent.

Artifacts observed on the surface
were on top of deflated soils
and are therefore in a secondary

observed consisted of lithic
debitage, tested cobbles, burned
rock, marine shell, and a single

in the upper 20 cm of the site along with surface
scatter. The artifacts collected from the shovel tests
consisted of eight flakes, nine pieces of angular debris,
one biface, one piece of bone, one mussel shell, and
an untypable arrow point (Figure 4-107). Bedrock was
encountered in all shovel tests at depths ranging from
20 to 40 cmbs (Table 4-45).
Summary
41BL22 was previously recorded by Jelks in 1960
during the Texas Archeological Salvage Project and
was revisited by EComm in February of 2010. Work
performed included 100 percent pedestrian survey and
excavation of six shovel tests on the site. The pedestrian
survey resulted in the discovery of one unidentified
Archaic-aged dart point and a large surface scatter of
cultural material. Shovel testing revealed the site to
have generally shallow deposits of soil, with artifacts
found between 0 and 20 cmbs.
Although initial investigations by Jelks reports an array of
diagnostic projectile points both prehistoric and archaic
in nature and two projectile points, an unidentified
Archaic-aged dart point and an untypable Prehistoric
arrow point, were encountered during our visit, temporal
affiliation of the site is considered to be unknown. All
points observed during the initial visit by Jelks were
observed on the surface and consisted of both Prehistoric
and Archaic diagnostic point types. Due to the mixing of
the temporal diagnostic point types on the surface along
with a surface scatter of lithic debris observed during
both the initial and our investigations, the artifacts are
considered to be in a secondary palimpsest context.

Results

Further evidence of this is seen in the context of the two points encountered during our visit.
The Archaic-aged dart point was found on the surface of the site while the untypable arrow
point was encountered in a shovel test at a depth of 0–20 cmbs. Despite the mixing of cultural
material at the site and an unknown temporal affiliation, evidence shows that occupation of
the site possibly occurred during the Late Archaic period and continued through the Late
Prehistoric period.

4.12.3 Site 41BL39
Site 41BL39 was originally documented during the Texas Archeological Salvage Project by
Scurlock in 1962. The site was described as an open midden site located on a slight rise that
overlooks Cedar Creek to the north. Vegetation of the site consists of scrub brush and grasses.
Scurlock documented that the site contains a group of three midden features and contains
cultural material consisting of Perdiz points, one dart point, an untyped projectile point, and
flakes. The condition of the site during the initial investigation was noted as disturbed.
Archaeologists from EComm revisited the site in February of 2010 to reassess the condition
of the site and its potential for nomination to the NRHP. At the time of our investigation of the
area, the water levels of Belton Lake were up 15 ft from the normal pool elevations limiting
our effort of survey to the side slope of a the ridge. During the surface inspection of the ridge
no cultural material was observed. However, based on the observation of surficial artifacts,
across the USACE property line and into private property, it is believed cultural material
associated with 41BL39 is still present; although no assumptions can be deduced regarding its
artifact concentrations or condition of midden features. Due to the amount of exposed bedrock
combined with extremely shallow soils that range between 0 and 5 cm thick, ground surface
visibility exceeded 30 percent. Thus, THC Survey Standards require no shovel testing. Despite
the apparent lack of cultural material on the side slope and the presence of cultural material
on private property, 41BL39 still exists. However, the extent of the site is unknown due to the
USACE property line restrictions and the understanding that the site’s core originates outside
USACE property on more level land.

4.12.4 Site 41BL59
Site 41BL59 was originally recorded in 1962 by Scurlock during the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project. The site was described as a burned rock midden site composed of 13 burned
rock midden mounds. The mounds are described as circular in shape measuring 1.5 to 3.5 ft
high and are confined within an acre area of land. The site is located on top of a bluff that is
characterized as having a rocky pasture that is sparsely covered by cedar and oak (Figures 4-108
and 4-109). During their investigations, archaeologists collected points, scrapers, and knives.
Based on the artifacts collected the site is believed to have an Archaic cultural affiliation.
During February of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited 41BL59 to reassess the condition
of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. During the survey of the
area 41BL59 was relocated but only two burned rock mounds were observed rather than the
184

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

13 originally described. At the
time of this survey water levels
of Belton Lake were up 15 ft
and bordered along the bluff.
Due to the high lake levels it is
presumed that the remaining 11
mounds were submerged or are
on adjacent private property.
Only a small portion of the
bluff was accessible for survey
due to the rising water and
a private property fenceline.
Surface visibility of the area was
approximately 85 percent due
to the lack of vegetation along
the rocky bluff. During survey,
the site was located on transect
by a moderate surficial scatter
of debitage, which is associated
with the two burned midden
features. Based on the surface
scatter of lithic debitage, the
sites’ boundaries were expanded
to include all cultural materials.
The site boundaries follow
private property boundaries,
original site boundaries, and
the extent of the surface scatter.
41BL59 now measures 100 x 30
m.

Features
Two features were encountered
during the survey of the site.
The features encountered were
originally identified as mound
shaped burned rock middens.
Original documentation of the
middens describes the mounds
as measuring 1.5–3.5 ft in
height. However the features are
currently only 30–70 cm (12–28
inches) high.

Results

Feature 1 is a mounded burned rock midden located the edge of the bluff. The mound measures
approximately 9 x 7 m and stands approximately 30–50 cm above the ground surface. Several
looter scars are noticeable, and the central apex of the mound contains two depressions that
may also be attributed to looting or which may cultural. Cultural material associated with the
mound consists of fire-cracked rock and scattered lithic debitage.
Feature 2 is also a mounded burned rock midden located upslope from Feature 1 on exposed
bedrock of the bluff overlooking an unnamed drainage. The mound measures approximately
9 x 7 m and stands approximately 30–70 cm above the ground surface. As with Feature 1,
several looter scars are noticeable and the mound apex contains one centrally placed depression,
possibly due to looting. Cultural material seen within the feature consists of fire-cracked rock,
lithic debris, and several groundstone fragments.
Surface Assemblage
During the survey of 41BL59 archaeologists encountered moderated surficial scatter of cultural
material between and outside the two identified burned rock middens. Cultural material
observed consisted of numerous flakes both worked and unworked, biface fragments, unifacial
tools, heat treated flakes, and fire-cracked rock. No diagnostic artifacts were observed.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the inspection of the site’s surface, six shovel tests were excavated, yielding a
total of 19 artifacts in four shovel tests. Of the 19 artifacts found, 14 were encountered from
0–20 cmbs while five were encountered from 20 to 40 cmbs (Table 4-46). Artifacts collected
consisted of nine flakes, nine pieces of angular debris, and one biface. Bedrock was encountered
in all shovel tests at depths between 20 and 40 cmbs.

Summary
41BL59 was originally recorded in 1962 during the Texas Archeological Salvage Project. The
site was originally described as burned rock midden site consisting of 13 burned rock mounds
within an acre area.

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

The site was revisited in February of 2010 by EComm archaeologists to reassess the condition
of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. During our visit to the site
the water levels of Belton Lake were up 15 ft from the normal pool elevation. Due to the high
water levels only two of the 13 mounded burned rock middens were above water.
Our reassessment of the site consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey and excavation of
six shovel tests. Due to the lack of soils on the bluff no shovel tests were excavated The newly
established site boundaries use existing boundaries of the site, private property fencelines,
and the extent of the surface scatter, which encompasses an area of approximately 100 x 30 m.
During the initial visit to the site in 1962 Archaic-aged dart points were collected indicating that
the site has an Archaic cultural affiliation. Because no diagnostic artifacts were encountered
during our visit the cultural affiliation remains the same.

4.12.5 Site 41BL79
Site 41BL79 was first recorded in 1962 by Scurlock during the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project. The site was described as a burned rock midden site located on a bluff above the
floodplain of Cedar Creek. The site consists of two mounded burned rock middens measuring
30 ft in diameter and stand approximately 1.5 ft in height. Cultural material collected during
the survey consisted of a Wells dart point, two blade fragments, and a possible Waco sinker.
Based on the presence of a Wells dart point suggests that the site has an Early Archaic cultural
affiliation.
In February of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited 41BL79 to reassess the condition of
the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. The site was relocated on
the ridgeline of a prominent landform overlooking Cedar Creek, but no visible features were
encountered due to the creation of Cedar Creek Park (Figure 4-110). Creation and expansion
of Cedar Creek Park over the years has nearly destroyed the entire site. The site was only
identifiable due to a low to moderate-density, primarily surficial scatter of lithic debitage,
located along the ridgeline. The previously recorded burned rock middens were likely removed
during campsite construction. Despite the destruction of the site a 100 percent pedestrian
survey was conducted.
Surface Assemblage
Survey of the area consisted of inspection of the ridgeline and the area cleared for campsites.
Surface visibility of the site differed due to the different geographical formations. Visibility
along the ridgeline was approximately 30 percent while visibility of the cleared campsite area
on the ridge was roughly 75 percent. The assemblage of artifacts present at 41BL79 were
confined along the ridgeline and consisted of lithic debitage, heat treated flakes, tested cobbles,
and angular debris.

Shovel Testing

!

In addition to a 100 percent
pedestrian survey of the
area, nine shovel tests were
excavated. All shovel tests
were limited to the top of the
ridge due to the steepness
along the ridgeline. Of the
nine shovel tests excavated,
three were positive. Cultural
material collected from
the shovel tests consists of
four flakes and one piece
of angular debris. All came
from the upper 20 cm (Table
4-47). One shovel test was
excavated to a depth of 80
cmbs, seven encountered
bedrock at elevations ranging
from 40 to 60 cmbs. Only
one test was disturbed at a
depth of 60 cmbs.

In February of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited the site to reassess the condition of
the site and potential for recommendation to the NRHP. During our investigation of the site,
it was found that the entire site had been destroyed due to the creation of Cedar Creek Park.
The two mounds originally encountered during the survey in 1962 were completely removed
to create campsites. Although the site had been destroyed, remnants of the site were located
along the ridgeline. Few artifacts were encountered during shovel testing of the site. Soils are
very shallow and only an ephemeral of subsurface artifacts were encountered.

4.12.6 Site 41BL315
Site 41BL315 was first recorded by Turpin and Riemenschneider in 1996. The site was described
as an open camp site consisting of a lithic scatter located on an upland overlooking Cedar Creek
to the south (Figure 4-111). During their investigations of the site, Turpin and Riemenschneider
observed numerous flakes, a biface, and a base of a dart point, but the artifacts were located
in modern flintknapper
piles. Nonetheless based on

have been bladed and been pushed towards the bluff’s edge. The material present consisted of
numerous flakes. However, due to the disturbance, both prehistoric and modern materials have
been mixed and could not be differentiated.
Shovel Testing
Six shovel tests were excavated along the ridgetop. All shovel tests were negative for cultural
material. All shovel tests were excavated to bedrock, which was encountered between depths
of 20 and 40 cmbs. Shovel testing proved that during the creation of the campsites, the site had
been destroyed.

condition of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. The disturbance
to this site is insurmountable.

of mostly bedrock with thin soils
and a burned rock midden located
near an old road.
In February of 2010, EComm
archaeologists revisited the site
to reassess the condition of the
site and its potential eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP. During
our investigations of the site, the
burned rock midden was relocated;
however, when reexamining the
feature it appears that this may
not be a burned rock midden.
Although the limestone rock has

of the limestone rock, its structure,
and proximity to a bladed twotrack road indicate artificial origins. When the two track road was constructed, it appears some
of the rocks were pushed into a mounded form, which at a glance would appear to be a burned
rock midden (Figure 4-113). Nonetheless, EComm archaeologists conducted a 100 percent
pedestrian survey of the area accompanied with shovel tests.
Surface Assemblage
During our inspection of the site area no cultural materials were observed on the surface, but a
small mound, separate from the feature recorded in 1996, was observed on the ground surface
near the bluff’s edge. The mound is approximately 10 x 10 m and rises only approximately
50–60 cm above the ground. The small mound was further examined by shovel testing.

Summary
During our revisit of the site, the previously recorded feature was relocated using the original
site form map. Upon further examination of this feature, it was determined that it may be of
artificial origin. Shovel testing within the southwestern section of the site, near the bluff’s
edge, discovered a second mound rising above the ground’s surface. Shovel testing within
this mound encountered a 20-cm-thick subsurface lens of densely packed burned rock. No
diagnostic were observed or collected during our investigation therefore the site is considered
to have an unknown cultural affiliation.

4.12.8 Site 41BL1325
Site 41BL1325 is a 160 x 140-m extensive prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age
(Figure 4-114). The site is located within a small inlet. The drainage runs east to west into
the arm of the lake. A large
percentage of the soil within
the site has been removed
because of the sloping
topographic setting (Figure
4-115). Thus, large sections
of the site have extensive

accumulation of artifacts
within the drainage is
likely due to erosion and
pooling rather than an in situ
representation of cultural
activity with 41BL1325.
Due to the periodic flooding
of Belton Lake and the
transportation of soil down
stream by the intermittent
drainage, an elevated mound
of alluvium has developed
within the inlet. Upon further
investigation, a primarily
low-density scatter of early
stage debitage, modified

flakes, cores, crude bifacial
and unifacial tools, and
tested pieces were observed around the entire intermittent drainage. Within the expansive
low-density scatter are several smaller, denser clusters of debitage, which are located on the
eastern, northern, and southeastern portions of the site. The site was primarily delineated using
topography and the surface scatter of artifacts.
Shovel Testing
In addition to inspection of the site’s surface, 13 shovel tests were excavated, but no artifacts
were encountered. Of the 13 shovel tests excavated, six were terminated at bedrock, one was
terminated due to roots, one was terminated at a large rock, and five were terminated at clay.
Summary
Site 41BL1325 is a 160 x 140-m extensive prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age.
Work conducted at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 13 shovel
tests. Inspection of the site reveled that the majority of the artifacts are scattered around the
intermittent drainage. Shovel testing revealed the site to have generally shallow soils ranging

Site 41BL1326 is a 215 x 45-m prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age (Figure 4-116).
The site is located in a highly developed portion of Cedar Ridge Park. The scatter of artifacts
sprawls across a broad north–south running landform, which gently slopes southward and
leads to a prominent bluff that descends into Belton Lake. As seen in other ridgeline sites, a
band approximately 10–15 m wide, is more level and runs just above the bluff face. This more
level band also contains the majority of exposed bedrock in the site (Figure 4-117). Due to the

extensive park construction that
has taken place in and around
the site, the true extent of the
site is undeterminable. It appears
that only a small, disturbed
portion of the site remains.
Several areas have either been
bladed, artificially elevated, or
cut away to build parking lots,
roads, pavilions, and volleyball
courts. Thus, the majority of the
vegetation has been removed.
Only a few live oak, cedar, and
juniper trees remain standing.
Surface visibility is 10 percent.
Soils encountered consist of
Real-Rock outcrop complex and
Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex
soils.

The assemblage of artifacts
present at 41BL1326 consists of
secondary and tertiary debitage,
few cores, and a very light
fire-cracked rock scatter. The
fire-cracked rock was observed
in an area that had obviously
been bladed, which would have
removed the thermal feature
if it existed. In addition the
fire-cracked rock scatter may
only represent an incipient
scatter with no define hearth.
The concentration of artifacts
is densest directly adjacent to
the bluff’s edge, which could
correspond to the disturbance
that may have altered artifact
distribution.

Shovel Testing
In addition to the pedestrian survey of the site, seven shovel tests were excavated, yielding five
artifacts from one shovel test. The artifacts were encountered in the upper 20 cm and consisted
of three flakes and two pieces of angular debris. All shovel tests encountered bedrock at depths
between 20 and 40 cmbs.
Summary
41BL1326 is a 215 x 45-m prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age. Work at the site
consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of seven shovel tests. The inspection of the
site revealed that the site had been heavily disturbed. Shovel testing revealed the site to have
generally shallow soils ranging from 20 to 40 cmbs with very few artifacts.

The primary component to 41BL1327 is a broad, moderate-density surface scatter of lithics.
Artifacts observed consisted of flakes, angular debris, bifaces, and cores.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the inspection of the site’s surface, 13 shovel tests were excavated, yielding 11
artifacts from four shovel tests. The artifacts were encountered in the upper 20 cm and consisted
of two flakes, eight pieces of angular debris, and one piece of fire-cracked rock. Bedrock was
encountered in 12 shovel tests at 20–40 cmbs, while clay was encountered in one at 40 cmbs.
Summary
41BL1330 is a 170 x 100-m prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age. Work conducted
at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 13 shovel tests. Shovel testing
revealed the site to have relatively shallow soils ranging from 20 to 40 cmbs with few artifacts
documented in the upper 20 cm.

4.12.12 Site 41BL1331
Site 41BL1331 is a 65 x 35-m prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined age (see Figure
4-108). The site spans from the shoreline of Belton Lake up onto an upland terrace of a gently
sloping landform. The landform is a north–south running finger ridge that originates outside of
the project area. The soils consisted of soils of the Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex that have a
depth of 10 cmbs underlain by limestone bedrock. Due to the shallow bedrock, the limestone
rocks and chert are eroding out. The vegetation is mostly dense cedar and juniper that is dotted
by oak and cacti. Surface visibility is 30 percent. As noted in other ridgeline sites, a band
approximately 10–15 m wide, is more level and runs just above the bluff face. This more level
band also contains the majority of exposed bedrock in the site and is where a percentage of the
site’s artifacts have pooled.
Surface Assemblage
The ephemeral scatter present in 41BL1331 is most notable near the edge of the landform. The
cultural material observed indicates that prehistoric peoples were obtaining crude chert nearby
and conducting light early stage lithic reduction. Cultural material observed at the site consists
of flakes, angular debris, biface, and cores.
Shovel Testing
In addition to a pedestrian survey of the site, seven shovel tests were excavated, yielding two
artifacts from the upper 20 cm. The artifacts consisted of one flake and one piece of angular
debris. Bedrock was encountered at depths between 20 and 40 cmbs.

4.13	Cedar Creek
Totaling 514 acres, the Cedar Creek survey segment included 5 acres of steep slopes. The
remaining 509 acres were investigated using 204 shovel tests, for a sampling density of 0.40
tests per acre. None of these tests were positive. During the survey of the Cedar Creek parcel
one previously recorded site was revisited; no new sites were found.

4.13.1 Site 41BL268 (Cedar Creek Midden)
Site 41BL268 was originally encountered in 1982 by Mr. Robert Scott of the USACE, Fort
Worth district, while investigating reports of vandalism. At the time Mr. Scott described the
site as an Archaic burned rock midden, consisting of burned rock, faunal material (bison and
deer bone), and lithic debitage.

examined. Originally, evidence of looting was reported as solely along the exposed cutbank
face, but during our survey, intensive looting was observed on the limestone upland of the site
as well. Approximately 15 large looter’s pits were observed on the surface of the site ranging
in size from 1–3 m with a maximum depth of 1 m. Material evidence of looting observed at
the site consisted of a broken shovel head and ½-inch mesh screen. Cultural material at the
site was present in the numerous piles of limestone cobbles and backdirt from the looter’s
pits and consisted of flakes, lithic debitage, fire-cracked rock, and broken tools. Based on the
appearance of the looter’s pits, looting of the sites seems to have occurred over a few decades
but currently do not appear to be active.
Surface Assemblage
During our revisit to the site, archaeologists conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the
site area. Although cultural material was present at the site it was all confined in the spoil piles
of the looter’s pits. Due to the vegetation present at the site surface visibility was fairly good,
approximately 75 percent. Despite the 75 percent surface visibility no artifacts were observed.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the visual inspection of the surface, six shovel tests were excavated, but no
cultural materials were encountered. All shovel tests reached bedrock at 40 cmbs.
Summary
41BL268 was originally encountered in 1982 by Mr. Robert Scott of the USACE, Fort Worth
district, while investigating reports of vandalism. At the time Mr. Scott described the site as an
archaic burned rock midden, consisting of burned rock, faunal material (bison and deer bone),
and lithic debitage.
Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL268 in February of 2010 to reassess the condition
of the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. The site’s original description
indicated looting has occurred at this locale for several decades. During Ecomm’s revisit,
archaeologists encountered the site in its previously described condition. Cultural material at
the site was present in the numerous piles of limestone cobbles and backfill from the looter’s
pits; consisting of flakes, lithic debitage, fire-cracked rock, and broken tools. Based on the
appearance of the looter’s pits, looting of the sites seems to have occurred over a few decades,
but currently appears inactive. The site has been completely looted and devoid of any significant
cultural material.

4.14.1 41BL1328
Site 41BL1328 is a 24 x 4 x 1.5-m
prehistoric rockshelter of an
undetermined
age
(Figure
4-125). The shelter is located in
a south-facing bluff overlooking
the Leon River approximately
250 m away. The rockshelter
is situated midway up the bluff
where the slope transitions from
nearly vertical to sheer cliff
(Figure 4-126). The shelter floor
contains deposits approximately
35 cm deep based on one
excavated shovel test. The floor is
very level with a few undulating
areas due to the presence of large
looter’s pits. Due to the extreme
slope, there is no talus present
in front of the shelter. The slope
contains dense cedar, juniper,
holly, mountain laurel, cacti, and
yucca.

Totaling 182 acres, the Morgan’s
Point survey segment included
100 acres of steep slopes. Of
the remaining acreage, about 40
acres were found to be inundated
along the shoreline of Belton
Lake and could not be shovel
tested. As a result, the segment
received 14 shovel tests, for a
sampling density of 0.17 test
per acre. Of these tests, one was
positive returning a rate of 7.1
percent ubiquity. A single site was
encountered during the survey of
the Morgan’s Point segment. A

The surface of the shelter’s floor contains only a light scattering of debitage and mussel shell.
Based on the one shovel test excavated, it appears that the majority of artifacts are present just
beneath the accumulated roof spall and organic debris, at around 3 cmbs. The cultural material
consisted of moderate accumulations of debitage, mussel shell, and angular debris, which are
present to bedrock at approximately 35 cmbs. The signs of recent looting are obvious. There
is one large looter’s pit with ¼-inch screen sitting nearby. As previously mentioned, the lack
of a talus is directly tied to the extreme slope. However, some fire-cracked rock with a darker
more organic soil was noted on the slope leading away from the shelter. This could indicate
the presence a burned rock feature that may have once existed along the shelter’s edge and has
since eroded away. Although some looting has occurred, a portion of the site appears relatively
intact and may contain diagnostic artifacts.
Summary
41BL1328 is a 24 x 4 x 1.5-m prehistoric rockshelter of an undetermined age. Work conducted
at the site consisted of a surface inspection and excavation of one shovel test. Inspection of
the surface revealed that some looting has occurred. Shovel testing revealed that the majority
of artifacts are present starting at 3 cmbs and that the shelter contained shallow sediments
reaching a depth of 40 cmbs.

4.15	Tanyard
Totaling 75 acres, the Tanyard survey segment included 10 acres of steep slopes, which were
excluded from shovel testing; the remaining 65 acres received 26 shovel tests for a sampling
density of 0.40 tests per acre. Of these tests, four were positive, returning a rate of 15.4
percent ubiquity. During the survey of the Tanyard parcel, one previously recorded site was
encountered. The site contains two components, a prehistoric and historic and falls under the
unknown prehistoric and historic period. Based on GIS data provided by the USACE and a
search of sites in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, a second site was shown to have been
located in this segment but the site has been completely destroyed. Detailed results of the two
sites are presented below.

Site 41BL48

Site 41BL48 was originally
documented
in
1962
by Scurlock during the
Texas
Archeological
Salvage Project. The site
was described as a small
rockshelter
measuring
50 x 5 x 8 ft with cultural
material
consisting
of
marine shell, snail shell, and
chert inside the shelter and
eroding from the slope. At
the time of documenting the
site investigators noted that
the site was undisturbed and
contained buried deposits
reaching depths of 2–3 ft.

Archaeologists from EComm
revisited 41BL48 in February
of 2010 to reassess the
condition of the site and its
potential for eligibility to the

it is unclear if 41BL48 was
relocated because the physical description of the shelter’s location differs from the rockshelter
encountered. The site was originally documented as being undisturbed. Since its discovery
a great deal of disturbance has taken place over many decades. Like a majority of other

rockshelters encountered along Belton Lake, surrounding landowners and boaters converted
the shelter into a dump.
Surface Assemblage
Despite being heavily disturbed due to utilization as a dump, archaeologists conducted a 100
percent pedestrian survey of the shelter and surrounding land form. Only one definite cultural
artifact was observed at surface along with small amounts of mussel and snail shell. The
artifacts were seen along the steep slope at the mouth of the shelter.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the pedestrian survey, one shovel test was excavated. The shovel test was excavated
inside the shelter and recovered modern pot sherds, canvas, and plastic to approximately 30–40
cmbs. No other shovel tests were excavated due to the extreme disturbance observed inside and
in front of the shelter.
Summary
41BL48 was originally recorded in 1962 by Scurlock during the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project. In that description of the site, 41BL48 was recorded as undisturbed, but the shelter we
encountered was completely disturbed. As is common practice around Belton Lake, people use
rockshelters in USACE property as dumping grounds. One shovel tests was excavated in the
shelter and recovered modern pot sherds, canvas, and plastic at approximately 30–40 cmbs.
Only one definite cultural artifact was observed on the surface, although small amounts of
mussel and snail shell were noted.

4.15.2 Site 41BL304
Site 41BL304 is a previously recorded site located in the Tanyard parcel, but no records
describing the site was were found in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas. The site form covers
only a small portion of the site and contains what appears to be counts of flint chips collected
in levels of shovel tests or excavation units; it is not clear which. Due to the high number
of artifacts from each level, it is possible that excavations were conducted in test units. The
original site records also include a site map of 41BL304. Based on these two documents it
appears that the site contained an unknown prehistoric component and a historic component.
The map contained locations of areas of burned rock, and an old wagon trail characterized by
wheel ruts etched into bedrock (Figure 4-128). Based on these records it appears that the site
incorporates cultural activity on both the north and south sides of Tanyard Branch, which is
now inundated and incorporated into Belton Lake (Figure 4-129).
In February of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited the site to reassess the condition of the
site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. Today, the setting of 41BL304 is
characterized by north and south elevated finger ridges that intersect into Tanyard Branch. The
soils consist of a silty clay loam that is approximately 20–30 cm thick. This overlies limestone

bedrock. However, some areas
north of Tanyard Branch contain
thicker soil deposits due to
intense prehistoric cultural
activity. Juniper, cacti, and mixed
grasses dominate the vegetative
setting.
Investigation of the site consisted
of a 100 percent pedestrian survey
combined with shovel testing and
due to the originally documented
wagon tracts archival research
was also conducted.

Archival Research
The tract encompassing Site 41BL304 is part of the George W. Lindsey Survey, patented on
July 16, 1845 from the Republic of Texas as a second-class headright survey totaling 1476
acres. In 1955, Ed Miller and his three sisters sold 1.9 acres (along with several adjacent tracts)
to the United States of America (Table 4-51). Though Miller was a resident of Bell County at
the time, all of his sisters lived in other states. The four siblings had inherited 257.8 acres of
land in the Lindsey and Simmons Surveys from their father Abe, who purchased it in 1945
(BCDR 536/144) from John Bassel. Bassel purchased the same land in 1933 (BCDR 502/539)
from Jennie Clearman and her daughter Ruby Woods. The Clearman family had owned the
land since 1912, when J. S. Clearman and his wife, Virginia (aka Jennie) bought the same land.
The Clearmans had two daughters: Dorothy and Ruby. The Clearman family probably did not
live on this tract, however. They are listed in both the 1910 and 1920 censuses as residents of
Belton.
J. S. and Virginia Clearman purchased the land from Henderson L. Thomas and his siblings,
all heirs of Ridley B. Thomas, after their father’s death. Ridley B. Thomas had owned various

parcels comprising the 257.8 acre survey since 1877 and earlier. Thomas and his wife, Matilda
(Mattie) are listed in the 1880 and 1900 censuses. In 1900, Ridley Thomas was 69 years old,
his wife, Mattie was 60 and the couple lived in Belton. It is not clear whether they lived on the
257 acre tract at some earlier time. In 1880, Thomas and his family are listed as living in Bell
County near Moffat, which is a few miles north of the land (US Census 1880). He listed his
profession as a farmer, and it is possible that he was, in fact living on this tract at the time. In
1870, the Thomas family lived in the Belton area (US Census 1870).
A 1916 soil survey map depicts two structures at or near to Site 41BL304 (Figure 4-130). More
salient to the actual site features though, is a road, which is depicted across Tanyard Branch
at this site location. The road skirts the edge of a steep escarpment jutting into a large alluvial
bend created by a meander of the Leon River. This road led to the Tennessee Valley Church and
the Tennessee Valley community, which was settled in 1851 by immigrants originating mainly

from Tennessee (Odintz 2010). No information was collected about this church. Clearly, the
ruts in the limestone observed during this survey and during the original recording of the site
relate to this old road, which was used from even before the time the Thomas family owned
this property.
Summary
Site 41BL304 is a previously recorded site located in the Tanyard parcel, but the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas contained no records indicating the cultural affinity of the site. The
original site records obtained at TARL were partial and included unit artifact counts and a site
map of 41BL304. Based on these two documents it appears that the site contained an unknown
prehistoric component and a historic component. The map contained locations of areas of
burned rock, and an old wagon trail characterized by wheel ruts etched into bedrock (see
Figure 4-128). Through archival research, it was discovered that the road led to the Tennessee
Valley Church and the Tennessee Valley community, which was settled in 1851 by immigrants
originating mainly from Tennessee (Odintz 2010). Shovel testing conducted by EComm at
41BL304 replicated the types of artifacts previously recovered, but in far small quantities. Out
of the 10 shovel tests excavated only four yielded cultural material between 20 and 40 cmbs.

4.17	Miller Springs
The Miller Springs survey segment totaling 592 acres and included about 180 acres, which
GIS analysis calculated as consisting of steep slopes. The remaining 412 acres recieved 165
shovel tests, for a sampling density of 0.40 tests per acre. Of these tests, four were positive,
returning a rate of 2.4 percent ubiquity. Seven sites were encountered within the Miller Springs
segment. Of the seven sites, four were previously recorded and three were newly discovered.
One of the previously recorded sites (41BL1051) was subsumed by an existing site (41BL55),
and another (41BL172) was found to not meet minimum site criteria. One of the sites classified
as a Historic period site while the others fall within the unknown prehistoric period due to the
lack of diagnostic artifacts. A detailed description of the results of each site is presented below.

4.17.1 Site 41BL55
Site 41BL55 was originally recorded in 1962 by Scurlock during the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project. At that time, it was described as an open site measuring approximately
200 x 75-ft, located on a 15-ft low sandy ridge within a barrow area. The site was described as
buried in the low sandy ridge that was the remnant of a terrace, since removed. Investigators
reported that the site was eroding both at the surface of the site and along the ridge cutbank.
Based on observations of the cutbank, cultural material was reported extending to a depth of 8 ft
below the modern ground surface. The original investigators excavated test pits and encountered
an intact cultural zone in the upper 12 inches of the ridge. Cultural material observed in the
cultural zone consisted of a burned rock feature, several other pieces of fire-cracked rock,
lithic debitage, snail shell, marine shell, and a point base. In addition to material collected from
excavation, investigators also collected material eroding from the surface. Cultural material
observed/collected from the surface consisted of worked cores, heat spalls, ocher, bifaces,
unifaces, angular debris, a painted river pebble, numerous worked flakes, unworked flakes,
tools, marine shell, snail shell, and numerous Archaic-aged and Paleoindian-aged dart points.
Based on the presence of the Archaic and Paleoindian points, the site was considered to have a
Paleoindian and Archaic cultural affiliation.
Following the original investigations of the site in 1962, at least two other visits to the site have
been conducted prior to the current work. One visit was conducted in 1990 by an avocational
archaeologist and member of the Texas Archeological Society Bob Burleson. Mr. Burleson,
long familiar with the site, visited it again after learning that the Texas Department of Highways
and Public Transportation intended to use the area for fill for a highway project in Bell County.
In a letter to Darrell Creel at TARL, Mr. Burleson enclosed all artifacts he collected from
his visit. The artifacts consisted of one Plainview-like point, the base of a Golondrina point,
the base of a Plainview point, and an endscraper. Mr. Burleson noted that the artifacts were
collected from the top of the highest ridge of undisturbed materials. He also noted that the ridge
was undisturbed except for erosion that had occurred over the many years he had been visiting
the site, and that additional worked chert and mussel shell were present in a large area within
the borrow pit.

in the remaining deposits.

During February of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited the site (Figure 4-131) to reassess
the condition of the site and evaluate its eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. In attempting
to revisit the site, several problems regarding its location became clear. The first problem
encountered was the location of the site. According to shapefiles provided by the USACE,
41BL55 is located east side of the relic channel of the Leon River. In contrast, the projection
of the site in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas places 41BL55 to the northeast on a tributary
drainage. In addition, UTM coordinates were problematic; four possible UTM coordinates

214

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

were discovered as possible datum locations. In attempting to decipher the true location of
41BL55, some additional history of the site was discovered.
In 1994, Carol Kehl surveyed a 25-acre tract during the Miller Springs Wetland Project. This
investigation recorded a new site (41BL1051) on the bank of the channel. The bank was reported
to have measured 10–15 ft deep from the top to the bottom of the channel; this description is
very similar to the cutbank described at 41BL55 during the original investigations of 1962.
The cultural material observed in the 1994 survey consisted of a small scatter of mussel shell
fragments and two flakes. Based on Ms. Kehl’s field maps and the description of the newly
recorded site, it appears that site 41BL55 was relocated but, because of incorrect locational
information on file for 41BL55, a new trinomial was assigned, 41BL1051. Based on the
proximity of the newly recorded site in relation to the true location of 41BL55, we conclude
that the 1994 survey actually encountered the remnants of 41BL55. Observations during our
2010 field visit (see below) support this conclusion.
Due to the confusion of the misplotted site, our efforts to relocate 41BL55 included a resurvey
and shovel testing of the entire area encompassing all three locations (Burleson’s location,
the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas’s location, and Ms. Kehl’s location of 41BL1051). This
work concluded that the site is located at the bottom of Belton Dam in an area that has been
subjected to alluvial degradation and that was heavily modified by the USACE in 1995.
Evidence of these events is seen in aerial photographs taken from 1936 to 1995. The 1995
aerial shows that the area had been bladed and relandscaped, altering any perception of the site
as originally described in 1962. The originally reported 15-ft cutbank now stands at 1.5 m high
(4.92 ft) which, in comparison to the original description, effectively removed any cultural
materials observed in the lower 8 ft of the profile. In addition to modifications to the area,
thick grass covers the landscape, allowing for 20 percent surface visibility. The entire area was
systematically surveyed and accompanied by shovel testing.
Surface Assemblage
Survey of the area consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian in which archaeologists were spaced
out every 30 m. Once the entire area had been surveyed, archaeologists then went back to
the areas where the three sites were plotted and further examined the surface for any visible
artifacts. In the area projected for 41BL55 in the USACE shapefiles, no artifacts were observed.
In the area projected for 41BL55 in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, no artifacts were
observed. In the area where 41BL1051 is plotted, no artifacts were observed. Although no
artifacts were observed in the three localities, artifacts were observed solely located above and
within a prominent cutbank west of the relic river channel between the projected location of
41BL55 and 41BL1051. The cultural material observed consisted of a small scatter of flakes.
No diagnostic artifacts were observed.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area, 23 shovel tests were excavated
across the entire area, including eight shovel tests conducted on transect and 15 additional tests

placed in the three possible localities. Termination of the shovel tests were based on depth,
gravel, disturbance, and the presence of clay or bedrock. Clay was encountered in four tests at
depths ranging from 40 to 60 cmbs; bedrock was encountered in one test at 40 cmbs; gravels
were encountered in one test at 80 cmbs; and one shovel test was disturbed at 40 cmbs. All
shovel tests were negative; no artifacts were encountered during the excavation of any shovel
test.
Summary
41BL55 was first recorded in 1962 and was considered to have Paleoindian and Archaic
cultural affiliations. At that time, the site measured approximately 200 x 75 ft. Subsequent visits
were conducted in 1990 by Bob Burleson, an avocational archaeologist concerned with the
destruction of the site, and in 2001 by Michael Collins, who was concerned with the integrity
of the site. During Burleson’s visit, three Paleoindian points were collected from the surface of
an undisturbed area of the site and were submitted to TARL. In Dr. Collins’s visit, he examined
the floor of the borrow pit and examined an intact profile. Both investigations verified the
presence of an ephemeral Paleoindian component. In addition, the area was visited during the
Miller Springs Wetland Project in 1994 by Carol Kehl, who documented a new site, 41BL1051,
just south of the presumed location of 41BL55 within a 25-acre channel created by floodwaters
during floods in 1991 and 1992. However, based on the proximity of the newly recorded site in
relation to the true location of 41BL55, it is probable that the 1994 survey actually encountered
the remnants of 41BL55.
In February 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited 41BL55 and concluded that 41BL1051 was
in fact part of 41BL55. Based on this determination, 41BL1051 was subsumed by 41BL55.
Both the 1962 and 1994 site forms discuss a prominent cut bank with cultural material. When
it was originally surveyed, the cutbank measured 15 ft high. The site does not appear nearly
as significant as observed in 1962. Due to environmental and human agents, the site has been
significantly destroyed. The reported 15-ft cutbank now stands 1.5 m high (4.92 ft). Despite the
removal of cultural material originally described in 1962, 1990, and 1994, artifacts were still
observed on the surface, but were very minimal.

4.17.2 Site 41BL172
Site 41BL172 was recorded in 1976 by Hayhurst. The site was described as a rockshelter.
The front chamber of the shelter measured 4.6 ft across with a height of 4 ft the extent of the
rear chamber was described as unknown. At the time of the initial visit only one artifact was
reported as being collected. The artifact was described as being a carved rock, which was
determined as being a human head broken from a figurine. No other cultural material was
reported.
In February of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited the site to reassess the condition and
potential eligibility for the NRHP. During the revisit of 41BL172, the nature of the site was
question. The sole artifact identified during the previous visit was a “head from a figurine.”
Upon revisting the site, no sign of prehistoric occupation was observed. The shelter is devoid

of chert or any material associated with prehistoric activity. There were no floor deposits that
could contain buried cultural artifacts or features. Two shovel tests were excavated at base of
ravine to see if artifacts had eroded down slope, but no artifacts were encountered. Since the
rockshelter was devoid of cultural material the location is not considered to meet minimum
criteria as an archaeological site.

4.17.3 Site 41BL320 (Miller Springs)
Site 41BL320 was first recorded in 1988 by Ellison during the Burial Shelter Third Bluff
survey. The site was described as a rockshelter measuring approximately 13 x 7 m. At the time
of the initial investigation the shelter had been looted intensively, leaving a scatter of lithic
material from several different periods across the surface (Figure 4-132). Cultural material
collected during the investigations consisted of bone, lithics, shell, wood, rock, rubber, and
teeth. Based on the human remains it appeared that the vandals, prior to the investigation had
encountered two burials.
Archaeologists from EComm revisited 41BL320 in February of 2010 to reassess the condition
of the site and its potential eligibility to the NRHP (Figure 4-133). During our investigations
looting activities recorded during the initial investigations were observed. Potholes covering
the majority of the floor have greatly diminished the cultural significance of the deposits in
the rockshelter. Only approximately 10 percent of the floor deposits remain intact. Despite
the excessive amount of looting at the site archaeologists conducted a 100 percent pedestrian
survey of the site and excavated one shovel test.
Surface Assemblage
During the inspection of the site, archaeologists
observed several small bone fragments, but
whether they were animal or human in origin
was unknown. Due to reports of burials in the
shelter at the time of the initial investigations, it
possible that a majority of the bone fragments
were human. In addition to observance of
bone in the shelter, a large number of lithic
debitage was seen in the numerous spoil piles
from looting activities.
Shovel Testing
One shovel test was excavated in a presumed
intact area in the shelter (Table 4-52) and
yielded artifacts up to approximately 50 cmbs.
The majority of artifacts were encountered
between 20 and 40 cmbs. Artifacts collected
from the shovel test totaled 105 and consisted

of 30 flakes, 14 pieces of firecracked rock, seven pieces
of angular debris, 37 mussel
shells, and 17 snail shells.
Although it appears that the
cultural material is within
a well-stratified context,
the site was looted over
several decades, and due to
the mixing and moving of
sediment it is possible that
these deposits are out of
context.

41BL320 was first recorded
in 1988 by Ellison during
the Burial Shelter Third
Bluff survey. The site was
described as a rockshelter
measuring
approximately
13 x 7 m. At the time of
the initial investigation the
shelter had been looted
intensively, leaving a scatter
of lithic material from several
different time periods across
the surface.

Archaeologists
from
EComm revisited 41BL320 in February of
2010 to reassess the condition of the site and
its potential eligibility to the NRHP. During
our investigations of the site it was observed
that the level of preservation at 41BL320 is
very low. From the previous records regarding
41BL320, looting has occurred since prior to
1988. The potholes cover the majority of the
floor deposits and have greatly diminished the
cultural significance of the rockshelter.

During the previous visit, human remains were said to be present, but no definite signs of burial
remains were noted during Ecomm’s revisit. Small bone fragments were observed, but were
undecipherable as to their origins. Only approximately 10 percent of the floor deposits remain

intact. One shovel test was excavated in a presumed intact area and recovered a high amount
of artifacts up to approximately 50 cmbs. However, due to the extreme disturbance it is not
known if the artifacts contain contextual integrity.

4.17.4 Site 41BL1051
Site 41BL1051 was first recorded by Kehl in 1994 during the Miller Springs Wetland Project.
The site was described as a small artifact scatter consisting of a scatter of mussel shell and
two flakes. The site is located within a 25 acre channel created by floodwaters during floods
in 1991 and 1992. Based on the description provided on the State of Texas Archeological Site
Data Form the site description fits well with the site description of and existing site 41BL55.
Due to the proximity 41BL1051 in relation to the correct location of 41BL55, it is apparent
that the 1994 survey encountered the remnants of 41BL55. Therefore during the investigation
of EComm in January of 2010, 41BL1051 was subsumed by 41BL55.

Site 41BL1317 is a 70 x 60-m

modern USACE construction. The site is located near an abandoned road and storage yard that
has likely cleared away some historic-period debris. Soils encountered at the site are composed
of soils from the Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex. The vegetation contains cedar/juniper trees
with a few scattered oak. The understory is moderately clear with small shrubs, greenbrier, and
dense leaf litter. Surface visibility is 50 percent.

Artifacts observed at the site
were primarily clustered in a
pile that has the appearance
a locale that was repeatedly
used as an informal dump site.
None of the artifacts exhibit
any signs of burning or melting.
Artifacts observed but not
collected included beverage
cans, condensed milk cans, food
cans, clear and brown bottles,
condiment bottles and jars

suitcase fragments, lantern
pieces, barbed wire, scrap metal,

oil cans, spice cans, tea tins,
and tobacco tins (Figure 4-135).
In addition, several trees had strands of barbed wire wrapped around them, but it is unclear
if the wire once connected the trees. Numerous artifacts were sketched and photographed
that contained maker’s marks and diagnostic measurements. These included glass jars with
maker’s marks from Knoxville glass that date to 1941–1953 and 1932–1953 (Lockhart 2000),
Hazel Atlas that date to 1923­–1964 (Whitten 2010), Owens-Illinois marks that date to ca.
1937 (Lockhart 2004), Anchor Hocking that date to 1938–present (Lockart 2000), as well as
Prince Albert tobacco tins, and a Tetley tea tin. The beverage cans observed were opened with
a church-key can opener rather than a manufactured tab, suggesting they predate 1956. In
general, all of the artifacts date to the middle of the twentieth century.
Shovel Testing
In addition to a pedestrian survey of the site’s surface, seven shovel tests were excavated;
however, no artifacts were recovered.
Archival Research
Site 41BL1317 is part of the Christopher Cruise Survey. In 1949, E. F. Saffold sold 0.38 acres
(this is the one that we think was actually 0.38 acres) to the United States government (Table
4-53). The deed did not specify any structures on the property.

The Saffold family originally bought the land from Mahala Burnett, widow of John H. Burnett,
in 1921. Mr. Burnett died in 1901 at the age of 66. Mrs. Burnett leased out the land and took
liens against it in order to keep it. At one point in 1918 she leased it for prospecting for oil and
gas (BCDR 294/396), and in 1915 she leased the right to cut cedar and hardwood on the land
(BDCR 265/235). Researchers were unable to locate any deed records that indicate when Mr.
and Mrs. Burnett acquired the land, but they also owned town lots in Belton for which they
filed a homestead affidavit in 1898 (122/14). Thus, it seems likely that this property was never
permanently occupied during the twentieth century.
Mrs. Burnett died in 1924 at the age of 85. She and Mr. Burnett are buried in the North Belton
Cemetery (USGenWeb Archives 2002).
Summary
Site 41BL1317 is a small dump site containing cans and bottles roughly representing the period
of 1940–1955. Characterized mainly by bottles, jars, and cans (as well as some suitcase and
lantern parts), the debris at 41BL1317 represents temporary camping or work debris rather
than household debris, and based on the mid-twentieth century date, it is likely debris relating
to the construction of Belton Lake Dam, which began in 1949 and was completed in 1954
(USACE 2007).

4.17.6 Site 41BL1318
Site 41BL1318 is a 200 x 75-m prehistoric surface scatter of an undetermined age (see Figure
4-133). The site is located on the southern most tip of a prominent finger ridge that extends to
the Leon River. The ridge is approximately 100 ft above the Leon River and its floodplains. On
the escarpment, there are large limestone slabs that have broken from shallow bedrock, which
is largely exposed. Majority of the site slopes to the south to the edge of the landform. In the
last 10 m of the landform, the ground’s surface becomes more level and is composed entirely
of exposed bedrock. Soils encountered at the site are from the Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex.
Surface visibility is 75 percent. The edge of the landform overlooking the Leon River contains
nearly vertical slopes that typically house rockshelters. In fact, 41BL1318 is located directly
above 41BL320, a previously recorded rockshelter.

Surface Assemblage
The densest accumulation of artifacts lay in the previously mentioned 10-m band of exposed
bedrock. Artifacts observed in this area consisted of chert cobbles, bifaces, unifaces, flakes, and
some fire-cracked rock. All artifacts observed appear to be in a secondary palimpsest context.
Shovel Testing
In addition to inspection of the site’s surface, six shovel tests were excavated, but no artifacts
were encountered. Shovel testing of the site revealed that the site is only indicated by its
surface scatter and that the soils at the site are very shallow. Bedrock was encountered in all
shovel tests at a depth of 20 cmbs.
Summary
41BL1318 is a 200 x 75-m prehistoric surface scatter of an undetermined age, located directly

Eckrant-Rock outcrop soils, which are typically shallow. Vegetation of the site consists of
cactus, small grasses, cedar trees, oak, and yucca. Surface visibility is 50 percent.
Surface Assemblage
The site is composed of an ephemeral scatter of flaked stone. The scatter consists of numerous
complete and incomplete flakes, angular debris, unifaces, bifaces, tools, cores, and some firecracked rock. No features or concentration were encountered.
Shovel Testing
In addition to the inspection of the site’s surface, 18 shovel tests were excavated, one of which
was positive for cultural material. One flake was encountered in the upper 20 cm of the site.
Due to shallow soils present on top of the ridge, shovel tests reached a maximum depth of 30
cmbs.

Totaling 194 acres, the West Cliff Park survey segment included about 70 acres of steep slopes.
The remaining 124 acres were found to include large areas of inundation along the shoreline of

per acre. None of these tests were positive and no sites were encountered within the West Cliff
Park survey segment.

4.19	Sparta Valley
The Sparta Valley survey segment totaled 121 acres. Of this acreage, 81 acres consisted of
steep slopes and were surveyed but not shovel tested. The remaining 40 acres also included
significant inundated areas along the shoreline of Belton Lake. As a result, only two shovel tests
were excavated in the Sparta Valley segment. Neither of these tests were positive. Nonetheless,
two sites were recorded, including one newly recorded rockshelter site. Due to the lack of
diagnostic artifacts, the rockshelter falls within the unknown prehistoric period. In addition,
previously recorded site 41BL869 should have been within the survey segment but was never
found.

4.19.1 Site 41BL869
Site 41BL869 was originally recorded in 1986 by S. Kooren and Gemma Mehalchick as a
lithic scatter. Investigators recorded a surficial scatter of lithic artifacts consisting of flakes,
knives, bifaces, and unifacial tools. These artifacts were scattered along the slope and toe
slope of a prominent landform stretching approximately 50 x 100 m. In addition to the surface
scatter observed investigators documented large sections of exposed bedrock touching the lake
shoreline contained a high amount of lithic material.
In February of 2010, EComm archaeologists revisited 41BL869 to reassess the condition of
the site and its potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP. During the revisit to the site
archaeologists did not observe any cultural material on the slope or shoreline. Due to prior
flooding the lake level had risen approximately 15 ft. Thus, the exposed bedrock area near the
shoreline, observed in 1986, would have been completely submerged. It is likely that the site
was missed because of high water and the ephemeral nature of 41BL869’s artifact scatter. In
accordance with THC Survey Standards, no shovel tests were excavated on slopes greater than
20 percent.

4.19.2 Site 41BL1329
Site 41BL1329 is a rockshelter
of an undetermined age. The
site is located near the top
of an expansive landform
overlooking the confluence
of Cowhouse Creek and the
Leon River. The rockshelter

Summary
Site 41BL1329 is a rockshelter of an undetermined age. The shelter measures approximately
40 m long by 5 m deep by 1.5 m high. Work conducted at the site consisted of a surface
inspection and excavation of two shovel tests. Inspection of the site revealed that the site had
been looted recently. Shovel testing revealed that below the first 5 cm of spall is a much denser
accumulation of artifacts and that the shelter contained shallow sediments reaching depths
between 20 and 40 cmbs.

Conclusions
This cultural resources inventory investigated 6,195 acres owned by the US government and
managed by the USACE along the shoreline of Belton Lake in Bell and Coryell counties of
Central Texas. For logistical purposes, the acreage was organized into 19 survey segments
ranging in size from 75 to 1,156 acres. Eighteen of the segments were wholly within Bell
County, while the nineteenth segment (Horseshoe Bend) included 86 acres in Bell County and
1,070 acres in Coryell County. As a whole, the survey included 5,125 acres in Bell County and
1,070 acres in Coryell County.
Field methods included a pedestrian survey accompanied by manual excavation of 2,320 shovel
tests. Tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon or
to 80 cmbs, whichever was encountered first. The pedestrian survey was supplemented with a
boat survey along the shoreline along selected survey segments where access was difficult by
land and/or where the slope was too steep for safe traverse by foot.
GIS analysis prior to fieldwork determined that portions of the survey area consisted of steep
slopes greater than 20 percent. In accordance with THC survey standards, shovel tests were
not excavated on 1,045 acres having slopes in excess of 20 percent. As a result, shovel testing
was conducted on 5,150 acres of terrain having slopes less than 20 percent (Table 5-1). These
acres received 2,320 shovel tests for a net testing rate of 0.45 tests per acre, well above the
contractual target of 0.33 tests per acre.
In addition, shovel testing proved to be impossible in some survey segments areas where high
levels of Belton Lake inundated the shoreline during fieldwork. This was especially true in the
Iron Bridge, Jubilee Springs, Morgan’s Point, Sparta Valley Park, Stampede Creek, Temple
Park, and West Cliff Park survey segments. Because testing could not be conducted on these
entire segments, net testing density in these survey segments averaged about 0.17 tests per
acre, about half of the target. Overall, testing density ranged from a low of 0.05 tests per acre
in the Sparta Valley Park segment (due to severe inundation) to a maximum of 1.09 tests per
acre in the Aycock survey segment (Table 5-1). Even including the 1,045 acres of steep slopes,
net rate of shovel testing was greater than the minimum target, and averaged 0.37 tests per acre
for the project as a whole.
The inventory investigated 97 archaeological sites. These included 51 newly discovered sites
and 46 sites that had been previously recorded as early as 1934. Of the 2,320 shovel tests
excavated, 334 tests contained buried cultural material, for a net yield of 14 percent (Table
5-2). Of the positive tests, 324 were on sites and 10 were isolated tests not clearly associated
with any site. The remaining 1,986 tests were negative.

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

Of the 46 previously recorded sites, three sites (41BL284, 41BL288, 41BL1051) were found to
be spatially contiguous with other previously recorded sites, and this investigation recommends
that they be subsumed by the existing sites. In addition, two sites (41BL48, 41BL79) were
found to be wholly destroyed and two sites (41BL13, 41BLl72) were determined not to meet
the minimum site criteria and are recommended for deletion. Finally, the field survey could
not verify the location or existence of three sites (41BL39, 41BL869, 41CV19), although we
suspect that these sites may exist, either underwater or beneath recent alluvium. All of the 51
newly discovered sites were fully documented (Table 5-3).
Ten of the sites are historic (or primarily so) and 87 are prehistoric. Only 18 of the 97 recorded
sites yielded temporally sensitive artifacts, consisting of diagnostic projectile points from
eight sites and historic materials from 10 sites. Temporally diagnostic items were recovered or
observed from barely nine percent (n = 8) of the 87 prehistoric sites.

5.1	Management Recommendations
The eligibility of an archaeological site for nomination to the NRHP is determined by evaluating
the site’s significance, or its potential to contribute meaningfully to future scientific research.
Research potential is assessed by comparing the types of data that are known (or are suspected
to exist) at the site, along with their provenience, context, and integrity, against a set of research
questions that have been previously recognized for similar sites in the region. All 97 sites are
briefly discussed below and a tabular summary is presented in Table 5-4.

41BL13 This previously recorded rockshelter has been destroyed by looting, wave action
and erosion. No cultural material was observed within or in front of the rockshelter.
No shovel tests were excavated due to the lack of soils. The shelter is devoid of any
cultural material and is no longer considered an archaeological site. No further work is
warranted.
41BL22 This is a previously known site that was described as an open occupation area with
three burned rock middens. The excavation of six shovel tests and pedestrian survey
revealed similar results. The site has generally shallow soil, with artifacts found between
0 and 20 cmbs. A probable Williams dart point and an untypable prehistoric arrow point
were encountered but are considered to be in a secondary palimpsest context. Due to
the heavily deflated soils and the shallowness of the deposits of the site, 41BL22 is not
considered eligible for nomination for the NRHP. No further work is warranted.
41BL28 When site 41BL28 was originally documented in 1935, 32 human burials were
excavated. However, the site has been seriously vandalized. During the revisit, EComm
excavated three shovel tests on the outer edge of the shelter and recovered 38 artifacts
from depths up to 80 cmbs. Despite the previous recovery of human burials, the current
NRHP eligibility of the site is uncertain due to the heavy vandalism. Shovel tests did
not clearly display a high degree of subsurface integrity. It is unknown whether any
pockets of intact deposits remain and/or whether any human remains still exist at the
site. The site should be protected. If it cannot be protected, then additional investigation
is warranted to clearly establish NRHP eligibility.

41BL34 Recent park developments have severely impacted the site’s previously identified five
sub-areas. Most of Area A has been disturbed, but shovel testing of a knoll revealed a
dense subsurface scatter of tertiary flakes and some FCR as deep as 100 cmbs. Area
B is defined as a band of artifacts eroding from upslope, which has been disturbed by
campsite construction. Area C is highly disturbed and contains no cultural material. No
cultural material was discovered in Area D, which is now the location of campsites. Area
E appears similar as it was when recorded in 2001. No tools or points were encountered
on the surface or in the 21 excavated shovel tests. Based on the current conditions of
the site, the potential for further research at 41BL34 is very limited and the site is not
considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No further work is warranted.
41BL39 This previously recorded site was not encountered. When the survey was conducted,
the level of Belton Lake was up 15 ft from the normal pool elevations, severely limiting
survey efforts on the ridge slope. The restricted survey area prevented the excavation of
shovel tests. No cultural material was observed on the surface within USACE property.
It is believed cultural material associated with 41BL39 may be present on the adjacent
private property, but its extent is unknown. The portions of the site on USACE property
have little potential for further research and the site is not eligible for nomination to the
NRHP. No further work is warranted.
41BL44 Erosion and a modern quarry on the western edge of the site have impacted this
previously recorded site. However, even with these disturbances the far north, central,
and southern portions of the site appear moderately intact and contain buried cultural
material. Twelve out of 23 shovel tests revealed dense accumulations of lithics from 20 to
80 cmbs. Although no diagnostic artifacts were recovered during EComm’s revisit, past
discoveries combined with high-density, and possibly well-stratified deposits, suggest
that the site may have potential for further research. The site should be protected. If
it cannot be protected, then additional investigation is warranted to clearly establish
NRHP eligibility and delineate intact portions of the site.
41BL48 When EComm revisited this previously recorded rockshelter, it was 100 percent
disturbed. One shovel test was excavated inside the shelter and recovered modern
pottery, canvas, and plastic at approximately 30–40 cmbs. Only one clearly prehistoric
artifact was observed, on the surface. 41BL48 appears to be destroyed and is not
considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No further work is warranted.
41BL54 In January 2010, EComm revisited the site and noted spoil piles from looter’s pits, but
no human bone was observed. Looter’s pits now are present throughout the entire site
rather than limited to the back of the shelter, as when first recorded. Only about 5–10
percent of the shelter remains intact and one shovel test was excavated within what
appeared to be intact deposits. The unit contained lithic debitage, snail, and mussel
shell until reaching bedrock at approximately 40 cmbs. Additional human burials are
possible but not demonstrated. As a result, the research value of the site is uncertain.
The site should be protected. If it cannot be protected, then additional investigation is
warranted to clearly establish NRHP eligibility and delineate intact portions of the site.

Conclusions

41BL55 During the revisit of 41BL55, it was determined that 41BL1051 is in fact part of
41BL55. Based on this determination, 41BL1051 was subsumed by 41BL55. Since the
1962, 1990, 1994, and 2001 visits, the site has been significantly damaged. Minimal
artifacts are present on the surface and no subsurface artifacts were recovered out of
23 shovel tests. Based on our investigations, 41BL55 is not eligible for inclusion on
the NRHP and no further work is warranted. However, based on the investigations of
Dr. Collins in 2001, we also recommend avoidance of the site due to its potential for
a low-density occurrence of Pleistocene faunal and cultural material deposits.
41BL59 During the revisit the level of Belton Lake was significantly above the normal pool
elevation. Only two of the previously reported 13 burned rock middens were above
water or within USACE property. A low-density surface and subsurface scatter of
lithic debitage was present between the burned rock features. Four out of six shovel
tests were positive between 0 and 40 cmbs, indicating pockets of shallow subsurface
deposits. No new diagnostic artifacts were observed. The burned rock features
rest on bedrock and potential for intact deposits is minimal due to disturbance.
However, large portions may remain intact. As a result, 41BL59 is assessed as having
uncertain research potential. The site should be protected. If it cannot be protected,
then additional investigation is warranted to clearly establish NRHP eligibility and
delineate intact portions of the site.
41BL79 It was determined that the entire previously recorded site had been destroyed by the
creation of Cedar Creek Park. The two mounds originally documented in 1962 have
been completely removed to create campsites. Remnants of the site were located
along the ridgeline. Some shallow subsurface artifacts were encountered during the
excavation of nine shovel tests. Based on our investigations of the site, 41BL79 is
viewed as not having further research potential. It is not eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP, and no further work is warranted.
41BL129 Six shovel tests were excavated in this previously recorded site. Three of the
shovel tests contained artifacts from approximately 30 cmbs. No human remains
were encountered during the revisit. Due to the lake level, shovel testing and
surface inspection of the entire area were impossible. No diagnostic artifacts were
encountered. The site has minimal potential for further research and is evaluated as
not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. No further work is warranted.
41BL136 The central feature of the site is a heavily vandalized burned rock midden that rises
30 cm above the surrounding ground surface. Six shovel tests were excavated during
the revisit; one encountered a 40-cm-thick lens of burned rock at approximately 20
cmbs. The lens was composed of large limestone fire-cracked rock and dense lithic
debitage, intermixed with a dark, organic soil. Although the burned rock midden
feature may have little remaining integrity, shovel testing is suggestive of a buried
and possibly intact component. As a result, the research potential of the site is unclear
and the site is evaluated as being of uncertain NRHP eligibility. The site should
be protected. If it cannot be protected, then additional investigation is warranted to
clearly establish NRHP eligibility and delineate intact portions of the site.

41BL137 A large portion of this previously recorded site remains moderately intact. The
site has been slightly affected by limited erosion of the southern edge of the site.
Of seven shovel tests excavated, two contained lithic debitage from approximately
0 to 20 cmbs. No diagnostic artifacts were observed. Although it appears the site
contains intact cultural deposits, this potential was not clearly demonstrated through
shovel testing. Thus, the site is evaluated as being of uncertain NRHP eligibility.
The site should be protected. If it cannot be protected, then additional investigation
is warranted to clearly establish NRHP eligibility and delineate intact portions of the
site.
41BL172 During the revisit of 41BL172, no sign of prehistoric occupation was observed
and the nature of the shelter as a site was questioned. The shelter is devoid of chert
or any material associated with prehistoric activity. There were no floor deposits that
could contain buried cultural artifacts or features. Two shovel tests were excavated to
see if artifacts had eroded down slope; however, no artifacts were encountered. Since
the rockshelter was devoid of cultural material, the location is not considered to meet
minimum criteria as an archaeological site. The site is not eligible for inclusion on
the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL249 The portion of this previously recorded site within USACE property is extremely
eroded and contains no significant data. Due to property boundary restrictions and
the erosional setting, only four shovel tests were excavated. Although artifacts were
recovered from 0 to 40 cmbs in three of the units, it appears that the site represents a
large lithic ridgeline scatter that has been displaced down slope by erosion. On this
basis, the site is assessed as having no potential for further research. It is not eligible
for inclusion on the NRHP, and no further work is warranted.
41BL250 Very similar to 41BL249, this previously recorded site is extremely eroded. The
portion on USACE property represents only the margins of the site, which is likely
located primarily on the crest of the landform. One out of five shovel tests contained
lithics from approximately 0 to 60 cmbs. This unit was excavated in an area were
eroded sediment and artifacts had pooled. The portion of 41BL250 that is within
USACE property is not intact and contains no significant data. On this basis, the site
is assessed as having no potential for further research. It is not eligible for inclusion
on the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL268 The revisit of the site noted a high degree of looting. The site appears to be
completely destroyed; looter’s pits in the midden contain deposits to approximately
50 cmbs, but no artifacts were encountered during the excavation of six shovel tests.
Due to the extensive vandalism of the burned rock feature and the lack of buried
cultural deposits outside the midden area, the site is evaluated as having negligible
research potential. It is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP and no further work
is warranted.

Conclusions

41BL282 This previously recorded site is heavily vandalized with evidence of at least six
looter’s pits. The looter’s pits appear to be recent and extend to a depth of 80 to 100 cmbs.
Twenty-one shovel tests displayed much shallower soils than the exposed looter’s pits.
Thirteen of the units contained flakes and debitage from approximately 0 to 20 cmbs.
Artifacts observed in the back dirt piles consist of flakes, unifaces, bifaces, and angular
debris. Similar artifacts on the surface appear to be out of context due to deflated soils.
No diagnostic artifacts were observed. Because survey and shovel testing data linked
41BL282 to nearby site 41BL284, the two loci appear to be a single site and 41BL284
has been subsumed into 41BL282. Due to the deflated soils and extensive looting,
41BL282 has negligible potential for further research. It is not eligible for inclusion on
the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL283 This previously recorded site contains approximately 20 looter’s pits. Eighteen of
these pits are located on the USACE side of the fence and two on private property.
Sizes of the looter’s pits varied from 50 cm to 5 m, with depths ranging from 30 to
100 cmbs. No diagnostic artifacts were observed. Because the portion of the site on
USACE property is heavily disturbed due to looting, 41BL283 is considered to have
low research value and is therefore is not recommended for nomination to the NRHP.
No further work is warranted.
41BL284 During our revisit of the site no midden was observed; however, artifacts were observed
on the surface and in the shovel tests. The scatter of artifacts and those encountered in
the shovel tests were linked to nearby 41BL282. Based on our investigations, 41BL284
is now subsumed by 41BL282. Due to the deflated soils and extensive looting, neither
loci has any potential for further research, and are not eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP. No further work is warranted.
41BL285 The central focus of this previously recorded site is a disturbed burned rock midden
feature. Four looter’s pits were observed on the midden, one of which measured
approximately 3 x 2 m with a depth of 1 m. Artifacts observed at the site were limited
to the back dirt piles from the looter’s pits and consisted of burned rock and few flakes.
Of six shovel tests placed around the site, only one test located in close proximity to the
midden yielded any cultural material at a depth of 0–20 cmbs, suggesting that the site
was limited to the burned rock midden that had been destroyed. No diagnostic artifacts
were observed. Based on our investigations of the site, 41BL285 appears to have been
destroyed due to looting and is considered to have no remaining research value. The
site is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL286 EComm revisited the site in February of 2010 and recorded two rockshelters that
were vertically aligned one on top of the other. Erosion of the limestone has caused
some of the overhang of the lower shelter to collapse. Inside the shelters, eight looter’s
pits were observed including four in the upper shelter and four in the lower shelter.
Only one out of three shovel tests contain cultural material including, flakes, debitage,
Rabdotus snail, and fire-cracked rock. Archaeologists also reexamined the midden
deposit on the ridge top above the shelter. Four large looter’s pits were observed in
238

this area, measuring from 1 to 5 m in diameter, which have apparently destroyed the
reported midden. The reported midden on the floodplain was not found but may be
submerged. No diagnostic artifacts were observed. Based on the extensive looting, we
do not consider the site to be intact and consider it devoid of any research value. The
site is not eligible for nomination for the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL287 When the site was revisited, both the lithic scatter and rockshelter were observed.
The lithic scatter proved to span the top of two ridges that are separated by a small
drainage. The rockshelter is located in the drainage below the escarpment and consists
of one large chamber with five access points, and is part of a subterranean cave system
below the escarpment. At the time of our investigation, approximately 20 looter’s pits
were observed, located mainly at the entrance of the shelter. The sediments at the back
of the shelter appear to be intact. Twenty-four shovel tests were placed along the ridge
tops and inside the rockshelter. The tests yielded numerous artifacts, including one
Middle Archaic Wells point and a Late Archaic Marshall point. Adjacent 41BL288 was
originally described as a lithic procurement site on top of the ridge in close proximity
to 41BL287. Based on the distribution of shovel tests it appears that 41BL288 and
41BL287 are continuous and are therefore grouped together; 41BL288 is now subsumed
by 41BL287. While soils on the ridge top are shallow and lack evidence of intact
deposits, the rockshelter retains intact deposits and may have potential for research.
The site should be protected. If it cannot be protected, then additional investigation is
warranted to clearly establish NRHP eligibility and delineate intact portions of the site.
41BL288 During our survey we were unable to locate the site using the UTM coordinates
provided by the Texas Site Atlas or the UTM coordinates provided by the USACE; one
set of coordinates locates the site on private property while the other places the site in
Belton Lake. Based on the projected location of the site in shapefiles provided by the
USACE, the site is presumably located on the ridge above 41BL287. Based on the
distribution of shovel tests it appears that 41BL288 and 41BL287 are continuous and
therefore were grouped together. 41BL288 is now subsumed by 41BL287.
41BL289 During the site’s revisit, looting was noted to be minimal; three looter’s pits were
observed and were located at the tip of the terrace. All looter’s pits were shallow at about
20–30 cmbs. Artifacts on spoil piles consisted mainly of large cores and core flakes.
Artifacts were visible on the surface and concentrated along the western and northern
portion surface of the site, and included flakes, bifaces, unifaces, cores, angular debris,
and broken tools. In addition to surface inspection of the site, 11 shovel tests were
excavated across the ridge. One shovel test located near the edge of the terrace returned a
very high density of lithic material and was terminated at 30 cmbs. Based on this shovel
test and the looter’s pits in the surrounding area, this locus appears to be a procurement
area, whereas the rest of the site is a lithic scatter. Despite the high quantity of artifacts
present, due to the shallowness of the soils chronological separation of components is
not feasible and further research at the site is severely limited. The site is assessed as
not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No further work is warranted.

Conclusions

41BL290 At the time of our investigations only the procurement portion was encountered.
The previously recorded rockshelters were not observed and are believed to reside
outside USACE property. The six excavated shovel tests indicated disturbance and
soil deflation across the site. It appears the majority of the site is located upslope on
private property. The portion of the site within USACE property does not appear to
be intact due to the construction of the two roads and erosion; therefore 41BL290
is considered to have no research potential and is ineligible for nomination to the
NRHP. No further work is warranted
41BL293 This previously recorded rockshelter measures approximately 35 m across the
face, with a depth of 10 m and an opening of 5 m that narrows towards the back.
At least six pits were observed ranging in size from 1 to 4 m. Artifacts observed
in spoil piles consisted of numerous flakes, some bifaces, and some unifaces. Six
shovel tests were excavated and only one was positive for cultural material. Due
to the severe disturbance, the cultural material in the shelter is not considered to
have any contextual integrity and the site has a very low potential for research. The
site is considered not eligible for nomination for the NRHP and no further work is
warranted.
41BL294 During our investigation of the site the burned rock midden was located but was
found to be riddled with numerous looter’s pits, completely destroying the integrity
of the site. Mounds of backfill were seen surrounding the pits, and artifacts were
present in the backfill. Cultural material was also present in two of the six shovel
tests excavated at the site however based on disturbance observed at the site and
because the site is located at the base of a steep slope, cultural material of the site
lacks contextual integrity. Due to the vandalism observed at the site, 41BL294 has no
remaining research value. The site is considered not eligible for nomination for the
NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL295 This previously recorded site consists of a ridgeline lithic scatter, a burned rock
midden, and a rockshelter. The ridge contains a heavily looted burned rock midden
that is surrounded by an ephemeral surface scatter of small flakes and angular debris.
Eleven shovel tests were excavated across the site. One shovel test was placed on
the midden and excavated to a depth of 80 cmbs. The shovel test yielded numerous
pieces of fire-cracked rock ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm, but lacked lithic artifacts.
The rockshelter measures approximately 35 m across, with an opening measuring
5 m high, and a depth of 10 m. The shelter’s floor deposits are highly disturbed by
looting. Artifacts observed in the back dirt of the looter’s pits included flakes, bifaces,
unifaces, and angular debris. No diagnostic artifacts were observed. Due to the heavy
disturbance observed at the site, intact deposits are considered unlikely. However, the
possibility of human burials in protected portions of the rockshelter cannot be ruled
out. As a result, the research value of the site should be considered to be unknown.
The site should be protected. If it cannot be protected, then additional investigation
of the interior portion of the shelter should be conducted to determine if any burials
are present and to clearly establish NRHP eligibility.

41BL299 The rockshelter originally recorded in 1985 has collapsed. Several limestone
boulders, likely remnants of an overhang, are scattered across the front of the shelter,
trapping sediments behind them. Currently only a small portion of the site remains
and continued natural erosion will eventually destroy the site entirely. Based on
our investigation of the site, 41BL299 has no remaining research value. The site is
considered not eligible for nomination for the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL300 The site’s previously recorded burned rock midden contains contained two large
vandalism pits measuring approximately 5 m in diameter, which have completely
destroyed the feature. Through pedestrian survey and the excavation of eight shovel
tests, no cultural material was observed except for that located in the spoil piles of
the looter’s pits. The artifacts observed consisted of numerous burned rock and few
flakes. Due to the extensive disturbance of the midden, 41BL300 is considered to
have no remaining potential for further research. The site is considered not eligible
for nomination for the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL304 This previously recorded site contains an unknown prehistoric component as
well as an old wagon trail characterized by wheel ruts etched into bedrock. Archival
research determined that the road led to the Tennessee Valley Church and the
Tennessee Valley community, which was settled in 1851. Shovel testing conducted
by EComm recovered small quantities of prehistoric artifacts. Out of the 10 shovel
tests excavated, only four yielded cultural material between 20 and 40 cmbs. As a
result, 41BL304 is assessed as having uncertain research potential. The site should
be protected. If it cannot be protected, then additional investigation is warranted to
clearly establish NRHP eligibility and delineate intact portions of the site.
41BL315 The disturbance to this site is insurmountable, which has made understanding the
site difficult. The artifact assemblage on the surface consists of tertiary and secondary
stage lithic reduction debitage. All six shovel tests excavated were negative for
buried cultural material. Unlike other ridgeline scatters, the denser concentration of
surface artifacts along the bluff’s edge is due to localized disturbance in the site.
The contextual integrity of the site has been completely destroyed and 41BL315 is
considered to have no remaining potential for further research. The site is considered
not eligible for nomination for the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL316 During our revisit of the site, the previously recorded burned rock feature was
located. During the excavation of six shovel tests, a slight mound was observed on
the ground’s surface. One shovel test was excavated on this mound and encountered
a 20-cm-thick subsurface lens of densely packed burned rock. The mound rises
approximately 50–60 cm above bedrock. No diagnostic artifacts were observed
or collected during our investigation; therefore, the site is considered to have an
unknown cultural affiliation. Based on our investigations of the site and due to the
shallowness of the soils, 41BL316 is considered to have no potential for further
research. The site is considered not eligible for nomination for the NRHP and no
further work is warranted.

Conclusions

41BL320 This previously recorded rockshelter has been heavily vandalized, and it appears
that only 10 percent of floor deposits remain intact. No definite signs of burial remains
were noted. One shovel test was excavated in a presumed intact area and recovered
numerous artifacts up to approximately 50 cmbs. Although the site has been severely
looted, it is not known if other burials other than the two originally documented
in 1988 exist. The possibility of human burials cannot be ruled out. As a result,
the research value of the site should be considered to be unknown. The site should
be protected. If it cannot be protected, then additional investigation of the interior
portion of the shelter should be conducted to determine if any burials are present and
to clearly establish NRHP eligibility.
41BL869 This previously recorded site could not be verified and is likely inundated by
Belton Lake. Archaeologists did not observe any cultural material on the slope or
shoreline, although we suspect that the site may exist underwater. On this basis,
41BL869 is considered to have no potential for further research. The site is considered
not eligible for nomination for the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL899 Conflicting information about property lines exists in the vicinity of this site and
some portions of this site were not inspected, including a burned rock midden that
is apparently outside of USACE property. The scatter of artifacts that has eroded
down slope was observed. Six shovel tests were excavated within a gravel bar in
Owl Creek and displayed no integrity. The portion of 41BL899 that is clearly within
USACE property boundaries has no potential for further research and is considered
not eligible for nomination for the NRHP; no further work is warranted.
41BL900 The site was originally recorded as a light burned rock scatter associated with a
lithic scatter. Like 41BL899, uncertainties regarding exact boundaries of USACE and
Fort Hood properties limited the effectiveness of our reassessment. Six shovel tests
were excavated in an attempt to record the condition of cultural material. However,
negative shovel tests were excavated north of the barbed wire fence that splits the
site and no artifacts were observed on the surface. If the site is present here, it is
extremely ephemeral and non-significant. This does not mean 41BL900 does not
exist, but simply means our efforts were unable to relocate the site within our survey
area. On this basis, 41BL900 is considered to have no potential for further research.
The site is considered not eligible for nomination for the NRHP and no further work
is warranted.
41BL1051 This previously recorded site is described as a small artifact scatter consisting of
a scatter of mussel shell and two flakes. During our revisit, six negative shovel tests
were excavated in an attempt to relocate the site. However, no cultural material was
observed during the delineation. It was later learned that due to the site description
provided on the State of Texas Archeological Site Data Form and the proximity of
41BL1051 in relation to the correct location of 41BL55, it is apparent that the 1994
survey encountered the remnants of 41BL55. As a result, site 41BL1051 should be
considered to be part of 41BL55 (see above).

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

41BL1151 The site is described as a large burned rock midden that extends approximately
275 m along the base of the bluff. Looting activities had been previously reported but
are now present across the entire terrace, destroying the portion of the site located on
USACE property. Eight shovel tests were excavated, but only one yield lithic artifacts.
The portion of 41BL1151 that is on USACE property has been severely impacted and
has no potential for further research. The site is considered not eligible for nomination
for the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL1152 The previously recorded site is described as an unknown prehistoric site consisting
of a buried terrace quarry. Our survey and shovel testing investigations at the site
discovered that the extent of the cultural material is larger than originally reported,
as is the level of disturbance. Out of 23 shovel tests, 11 were positive for cultural
material, which included flakes and angular debris. However, recent blading, dumping,
and road construction have severely impacted the site. Based on our inspection of the
site and shovel tests, cultural deposits within 41BL1152 have low potential for yielding
significant new information. The site is considered not eligible for nomination for the
NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41BL1153 This historic site is a pre-1900 dam measuring approximately 15 ft long and 8 ft
high. The dam is constructed of both cut and uncut limestone blocks, capped by random
bricks, cinderblocks, and concrete. The dam appears to have been rebuilt or modified
at several periods. Based on inspection of the site and shovel testing supplemented by
archival research, the site has a low potential for further research. The site is considered
not eligible for nomination for the NRHP under any of the four criteria and no further
work is warranted.
41BL1154 This site is a multi-component locus consisting of an Early Archaic lithic quarry/
scatter and a scatter of historic trash. Of 54 shovel tests excavated, only six were
positive. The majority of prehistoric artifacts were encountered within the upper 20
cm of the site and consisted of lithic flakes and angular debris. A light scattering of
prehistoric artifacts was observed on the ground surface, primarily near rocky outcrops,
and included early and middle reduction stage bifaces, core tools, and multidirectional
cores. The scatter of historic material included license plates and diagnostic cans and
bottles, which suggest this material was deposited around the time or shortly after the
creation of Lake Belton. Based on our inspection of the site and shovel tests, cultural
deposits in 41BL1154 have low potential for yielding significant data. The site is
considered not eligible for nomination for the NRHP under any of the four criteria and
no further work is warranted.
41BL1301 Eight shovel tests were excavated during the delineation of this newly discovered
prehistoric site. Two shovel tests yielded cultural material consisting of two lithic flakes
from approximately 0 to 20 cmbs. Shovel testing revealed the site to have a low-density
subsurface scatter. Based on the paucity of artifacts and lack of features, the site is
assessed as having negligible research value and is therefore considered not eligible for
nomination for the NRHP. No further research is recommended.

Conclusions

41BL1302 This newly recorded site contains both an unknown prehistoric component and a
historic component. Twenty-one shovel tests were excavated that produced a variety
of lithic flakes, unifaces, cores, angular debris, whiteware ceramic, brown glass, scrap
metal, amber glass, clear glass, and pressed glass. The historic-period archaeological
materials collected from 41BL1302 reflect typical domestic debris relating to the
early to mid-twentieth century, and are likely associated with the Winkler family.
However, given that no structures or features were noted at this site and that the
subsurface stratigraphic context is mixed, the debris is likely in secondary context,
dispersed by plowing or other landscape modifications. Based on the overall lack of
features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or
no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology.
As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no
further research is warranted.
41BL1303 This newly recorded prehistoric site contains an associated lithic scatter of
undetermined age that indicates procurement activities were conducted at this
locale. Through the surface inspection and excavation of nine shovel tests, numerous
bifaces, core reduction flakes, and bifacial manufacturing flakes were observed and
recovered. Shovel testing revealed that the site contained some deeply buried intact
cultural deposits, which contain unknown research potential, at a depth between 20
and 60 cmbs. On this basis, the NRHP eligibility of the site is unclear. The site should
be avoided and protected. If this is not possible, further testing at the site should be
conducted to clearly define its eligibility for the NRHP.
41BL1304 During the delineation of this newly recorded prehistoric site, an associated
lithic procurement artifact scatter of undetermined age was recorded. The site was
recorded using combination of a surface inventory dogleash, and the excavation of
seven shovel tests. The majority of artifacts observed was located on heavily eroded
soils over shallow bedrock and thus are in a secondary context. Based on the overall
lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers
little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local
archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the
NRHP, and no further research is warranted.
41BL1305 This newly recorded prehistoric site consists of a surface and subsurface lithic
scatter. The site was delineated and recorded through 100 percent pedestrian survey,
one 5 x 5-m dogleash, and excavation of 11 shovel tests. During shovel testing,
cultural material was primarily located within the upper 20 cm of the site Across the
site, steep slopes have eroded artifacts down the hillsides and are therefore considered
to be also in secondary context. Due to the location of the site on a steep side slope,
this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional
or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to
the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.

Archaeological Inventory at Belton Lake, Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas

41BL1306 Fifty-one shovel tests and seven controlled surface inventories were conducted
during the recording of this newly discovered prehistoric lithic scatter site. Artifacts
recovered during the delineation revealed that the area was used for procurement
activities, which occurred in an unknown age. Shovel testing revealed that soils
are generally shallow with few artifacts recorded. Recovered subsurface artifacts
were primarily located within the upper 20 cm. Due to the location of the site on a
steep side slope, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions
regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible
for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.
41BL1307 On this newly discovered prehistoric site, 17 shovel tests were excavated, which
revealed the site contains low- to moderate-density lithic scatter in generally shallow
deposits. Surface inspection revealed that the distribution of artifacts is relatively
even across the slopes and artifact types observed on the surface are consistent
with procurement activities. The overall integrity of the site is low and the lack
of diagnostic artifacts combined with deflated soils has made discerning temporal
components impossible. On this basis, the site offers little or no potential to answer
significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. It is recommended as
not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is warranted.
41BL1308 This is a newly discovered prehistoric open campsite of undetermined age.
Through one controlled surface inventory and the excavation of six shovel tests, it
was observed that the majority of artifacts are located on heavily eroded soils over
shallow bedrock. Shovel testing revealed the site to have very few buried cultural
materials to a depth of 20 cmbs. Based on the overall lack of features, absence of
diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to
answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result,
it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No further work is
warranted.
41BL1309 This newly recorded historic period site measures approximately 55 x 55 m.
Through the excavation of 12 shovel tests combined with a detailed surface inventory,
it was determined that the primary component of the site is composed of four partially
standing historic period structures with an associated surface and subsurface debris
scatter. Through a detailed archival search, the obtained deed records have matched
field observations with historic records and have dated the site’s earliest historic
period occupation to the early 1900s. One prehistoric flake was recovered from 0
to 20 cmbs and appears to be an isolate. Based on archival research, features, and
artifact content, 41BL1309 does not exhibit any characteristics or associations of
place, theme, or event that would make it eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. No
further work is warranted.

Conclusions

41BL1310 Eighteen shovel tests and three controlled surface inventories were conducted
during the recording of this newly discovered prehistoric site. Observed artifacts
consisted of non-descript lithics, which are located on top of and within shallow,
heavily deflated soils. Based on the overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic
artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant
questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as
not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1311 While recording this newly discovered prehistoric campsite, 27 shovel tests
were excavated. Shovel testing revealed two buried components, one between 20
and 40 cmbs and one between 60 and 80 cmbs. Observed artifacts place this locale’s
utilization within the Late Archaic period and an undetermined prehistoric age. Based
on the limited data collection on the site, research potential of the site is unclear and
the NRHP eligibility status of 41BL1311 should be considered as unknown. The site
should be avoided. If avoidance is not possible, then further investigations may be
necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and to clearly assess the site’s
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41BL1312 This is a newly discovered subsurface prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined
age. Work conducted at the site consisted of the excavation of 13 shovel tests. Shovel
testing revealed that the site is composed of a very low-density subsurface scatter of
lithic debitage. Based on the overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts,
and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant
questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is evaluated as not
eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is warranted.
41BL1313 This newly discovered prehistoric campsite/procurement site of undetermined
age contains intact buried deposits up to 100 cmbs. The integrity of cultural deposits
was assessed through the excavation of 19 shovel tests. Although looting activities
was observed, these activities appear minimal and have not fully impact the site. On
this basis, the site may have potential for further research and the NRHP eligibility
status of 41BL1313 should be considered as unknown. The site should be avoided; if
avoidance is not possible, then further investigations may be necessary to determine
the extent of cultural deposits and clearly determine the site’s NRHP eligibility.
41BL1314 During the delineation of this newly discovered prehistoric open campsite, nine
shovel tests were excavated to asses the subsurface concentration and integrity of
cultural deposits. Shovel testing revealed that the site contains an ephemeral deposit
of cultural material within the upper 40 cm. Due to a high amount of disturbance,
overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this
site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or
local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the
NRHP, and no further research is recommended.

41BL1315 Eight shovel tests and two controlled surface inventories were conducted
during the delineation of this newly discovered site. Artifacts were encountered in
eroded areas and appear to be in secondary context due to the disturbances of road
construction. Shovel testing found a low-density accumulation of artifacts within
generally shallow soils ranging from 40 to 60 cmbs. Based on the condition of the
site and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield,
this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional
or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to
the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1316 The six shovel tests excavated at this newly discovered prehistoric lithic scatter
contained only one artifact. Shovel testing revealed that the site has generally shallow
deposits of soils ranging from 40 to 60 cm over clay. Based on the condition of the
site and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield,
this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional
or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to
the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1317 Site 41BL1317 is a small historic dump site roughly dating to the period of
1940–1955. Characterized mainly by bottles, jars, and cans (as well as some suitcase
and lantern parts), the debris at 41BL1317 represents temporary camping or work
debris rather than household debris, and based on the mid-twentieth century date, it
is likely debris relating to the construction of Belton Lake Dam, which began in 1949
and was completed in 1954 (USACE 2007). As a result, it is recommended as not
eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended
41BL1318 This newly discovered prehistoric surface scatter of undetermined age is solely
composed of surface deposits underlain by bedrock between 20 and 40 cmbs. Through
the excavation of nine shovel tests and a general inspection of the surface, it was
observed that the site contained a moderate surficial lithic scatter. Based on the overall
lack of features and the absence of diagnostic artifacts, and subsurface artifacts, this
site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or
local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the
NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1319 Eighteen shovel tests were excavated during the delineation of a newly discovered
prehistoric lithic scatter. Shovel testing revealed that the site contains an ephemeral
accumulation of artifacts within generally shallow deposits of soils ranging from 0 to
30 cmbs over bedrock with only two artifacts recorded. Based on the condition of the
site and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield,
this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional
or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to
the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.

Conclusions

41BL1320 Eleven shovel tests and three controlled surface inventories were conducted
at this newly discovered prehistoric lithic scatter. Within the surface inventories,
four dart points were recovered, including an Early to Middle Archaic Wells and a
Middle Archaic Yarbrough. However, all four points were on exposed bedrock and
are considered to be in a secondary context. Based on the overall lack of features,
deflation of soils, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to
answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it
is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research
is recommended.
41BL1321 This newly discovered prehistoric lithic scatter contains a very low accumulation
of surface and subsurface artifacts. The cultural material was recorded by two
controlled surface inventories and the excavation of 12 shovel tests. Based on the
deflation of soils, overall lack of features and diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact
yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding
regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for
nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1322 This newly discovered prehistoric rockshelter has been previously looted and
marked with five 2 x 3-m pits, and is affected by active drainage of the seeps and
flooding of Belton Lake. The excavation of two shovel tests revealed that at least
a portion of the shelter’s floor deposits appear intact and extend to a depth of 40
cmbs. On this basis, the site may have potential for further research and the NRHP
eligibility status should be considered as unknown. The site should be avoided; if
avoidance is not possible, then further investigations may be necessary to determine
the extent of cultural deposits and clearly determine the site’s NRHP eligibility.
41BL1323 Thirty-one shovel tests were excavated in this newly discovered prehistoric
open campsite of undetermined age. Shovel testing revealed that buried deposits
were extremely disturbed and contained cultural material up to 40 cmbs. Based on
the condition and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low
artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions
regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible
for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is warranted.
41BL1324 The thirteen shovel tests excavated in this newly discovered prehistoric lithic
scatter encountered disturbed subsurface cultural deposits between the surface and
40 cmbs. The disturbance is the result of park construction that has subsequently
mixed and redistributed artifacts in the majority of the site. Based on the condition
and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield,
this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional
or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to
the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.

41BL1325 In this newly discovered prehistoric lithic scatter, artifacts are located in and
around a highly eroded intermittent drainage that cuts through the site. Thirteen
negative shovel tests determined that bedrock is between 20 and 40 cmbs. Based
on the condition and overall lack of features, diagnostic artifacts, and subsurface
artifacts, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding
regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for
nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1326 is a 215 x 45-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work at the site
consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of seven shovel tests. Inspection
of the site revealed that the site had been heavily disturbed. Shovel testing revealed
the site to have generally shallow soils ranging from 20 to 40 cmbs with very few
artifacts. Based on the condition and overall lack of features, diagnostic artifacts,
and very low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant
questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as
not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1327 is a 360 x 70-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work conducted at
the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of four shovel tests. Shovel
testing revealed the site to have relatively shallow soils ranging from 0 to 20 cmbs
with only a single artifact recorded. Based on the condition and overall lack of
features, diagnostic artifacts, and a very low artifact yield, this site offers little or no
potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As
a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further
research is warranted.
41BL1328 is a newly recorded 24 x 4 x 1.5-m prehistoric rockshelter of undetermined age.
Work conducted at the site consisted of a surface inspection and excavation of one
shovel test. Inspection of the surface revealed that some looting has occurred. Shovel
testing revealed the majority of artifacts are present starting at 3 cmbs, and that the
shelter contained sediments reaching a depth of 40 cmbs. Based on the limited data
collection on the site, the NRHP eligibility status of 41BL1328 should be considered
as unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then
further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits
and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.

Conclusions

41BL1329 is a newly recorded rockshelter of undetermined age. The shelter measures
approximately 40 m long by 5 m deep by 1.5 m high. Work conducted at the site
consisted of a surface inspection and excavation of two shovel tests. Inspection of the
site revealed that the site had been looted recently. Shovel testing revealed that below
the first 5 cm of spall is a much denser accumulation of artifacts and that the shelter
contained shallow sediments reaching depths between 20 and 40 cmbs. Based on the
limited data collection on the site, the NRHP eligibility status of 41BL1329 should
be considered as unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed
impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of
cultural deposits and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41BL1330 is a 170 x 100-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work conducted
at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 13 shovel tests. Shovel
testing revealed the site to have relatively shallow soils ranging from 20 to 40 cmbs
with few artifacts documented in the upper 20 cm. Based on the condition and
overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this
site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or
local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the
NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1331 is a 65 x 35-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work conducted
at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of seven shovel tests.
Surface inspection revealed that the site contained an ephemeral lithic scatter. Shovel
testing revealed the site to have generally shallow soils ranging from 20 to 40 cmbs
with very few artifacts. Based on the condition and overall lack of features, absence
of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to
answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it
is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research
is recommended.
41BL1332 is a 65 x 50-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work conducted
at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of seven shovel tests.
Surface inspection revealed that the site contained an ephemeral lithic scatter. Shovel
testing revealed the site to have generally shallow soils ranging from 20 to 40 cmbs
with very few artifacts. Based on the condition and overall lack of features, absence
of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to
answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it
is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research
is recommended.

41BL1333 is a 280 x 25-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work conducted
at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of seven shovel tests.
Surface inspection revealed that the site contained an ephemeral lithic scatter. Shovel
testing revealed the site to have generally shallow soils ranging from 20 to 40 cmbs
with very few artifacts. Based on the condition and overall lack of features, absence
of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to
answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it
is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research
is recommended.
41BL1334 is a 170 x 35-m prehistoric site consisting of Early Archaic and undetermined
prehistoric aged occupation. The Early Archaic occupation is based on the recovery
of one Uvalde point. The primary characteristics of the site are a large burned rock
midden and utilized rockshelter. However, the rockshelter and the heart of the site are
located outside the USACE boundaries. Work was only conducted within USACE
boundaries and consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of eight shovel tests.
Inspection of the site’s surface revealed that the portion of the site within USACE
boundaries had been heavily looted. Shovel testing revealed that an ephemeral scatter
of buried cultural material is located in the upper 20 cm; however, due to the looting
activities at the site these materials are viewed as lacking contextual integrity. Based
on the condition and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and
low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions
regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible
for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1335 is a 200 x 70-m prehistoric open campsite/lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work
conducted at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of six shovel
tests. Shovel testing revealed that soils at the site are very shallow with bedrock at a
depth of 20 cmbs. During delineation, the full extent of the site was never determined
because it overlaps onto private property. Based on the condition and overall lack of
features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or
no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology.
As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no
further research is recommended.
41BL1336 is a newly recorded prehistoric rockshelter of undetermined age, and measures
approximately 17 m long by 6 m deep by 1.5 m. Work conducted at the site consisted
of an inspection of the site and excavation of two shovel tests. Inspection of the site
revealed that the site had been looted. Shovel testing revealed that deposits are intact
at a depth of 40–60 cmbs and extend to a depth of 110 cmbs. Based on the limited data
collection on the site, the NRHP eligibility status of 41BL1336 should be considered
as unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then
further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits
and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.

Conclusions

41BL1337 is a newly recorded prehistoric site rockshelter with an associated lithic scatter.
Work conducted at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 12
shovel tests. Surface inspection revealed that the rockshelter portion of the site had
been looted. Shovel tests revealed that the associated lithic scatter is limited to the
eastern and northern edge of the finger ridge. Based on the limited data collection on
the site, the NRHP eligibility status of 41BL1337 should be considered as unknown
and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further
investigations within the rockshelter portion may be necessary to determine the
extent of cultural deposits and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41BL1338 is a newly recorded multi-component site. The only artifact relating to the
historic period found in shovel tests is a non-diagnostic porcelain fragment. However,
observations on the surface noted clear glass and a concrete trough, and these are
most likely related to the Kennedy or Michalk period of occupation. Additionally,
both historic maps and aerial photographs suggest that farmsteads were located
near this location during the early twentieth century. Site 41BL1338 contains only
limited evidence of these historic-period land uses. The prehistoric component at
this site is more visible through shovel tests, with 21 prehistoric artifacts recovered
from 14 shovel tests. However, no surface or subsurface features were identified.
This site is located on a wide alluvial terrace overlooking the Leon River in an
environment likely to contain prehistoric material, although more recent agricultural
activity has probably disturbed shallowly buried prehistoric materials. As a result, it
is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research
is recommended.
41BL1339 is a 150 x 80-m prehistoric lithic procurement site of undetermined age. Work
conducted at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of seven shovel
tests. Inspection of the site revealed that the site contains a low to moderate-density
surface lithic scatter. Shovel testing revealed that soils at the site are very shallow
with bedrock at a depth of 20–40 cmbs with very few artifacts. Based on the condition
and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield,
this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional
or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to
the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1340 is a 600 x 70-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work conducted at
the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 16 shovel tests. Inspection
of the site revealed that the site is composed of moderate- to high-density clusters that
are connected by a continuous low-density scatter. Shovel testing revealed that soils
at the site are very shallow with bedrock at a depth of 20–40 cmbs with few artifacts.
Based on the condition and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts,
and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant
questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as
not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.

41BL1341 is a newly recorded 12 m x 3 m x 1-m prehistoric rockshelter of undetermined age.
Work conducted at the site consisted of an inspection of the shelter and excavation of one
shovel test. Surface inspection of the site revealed that the site had been looted. Shovel
testing revealed an ephemeral scatter of cultural material in the upper 20 cm. Based on
the limited data collection on the site, the NRHP eligibility status of 41BL1341 should
be considered as unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed
impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of
cultural deposits and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41BL1342 is a 130 x 15-m prehistoric procurement site of undetermined age. Work conducted
at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 12 shovel tests. Inspection
of the surface revealed that the site is composed of three moderate-density clusters that
are connected by a continuous low-density scatter. Shovel testing revealed that soils at
the site are generally shallow with bedrock or clay at a depth of 40–60 cmbs with very
few artifacts. Based on the condition and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic
artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant
questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not
eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1343 Site 41BL1343 is a newly recorded prehistoric ephemeral lithic scatter of
undetermined age containing an ephemeral historic component as well. The site is
located on an alluvial terrace overlooking Belton Lake and measures approximately
100 x 90 m. Thirteen shovel tests were excavated yielding a total of 12 artifacts from
four shovel tests. Of the 12 artifacts collected, 11 were encountered in the upper 20
cm and one was collected from 40 to 60 cmbs. A Darl dart point was collected in
the floodplain and could have been re-deposited. The other artifacts recovered were
encountered within a disturbed sandy ridge. There are no structures depicted on the
1915 soils map. The single sherd of whiteware found in a shovel test could relate to
any of the three major occupations (Gent, Comer, and Carlisle families) at the site,
and is most likely a tableware fragment that was discarded and then displaced though
multiple plow episodes. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to
the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BL1345 is a newly discovered historic site. The artifacts and features relate to domestic
occupations of the late nineteenth through mid-twentieth centuries. A well feature may
relate to original period of use but was rebuilt and updated through the addition of a
concrete collar in subsequent years. Wire nails probably relate to site renovation that
took place after 1900. Concrete foundations also relate to site renovation that probably
took place after 1913. The prehistoric component of this site consists of a thin surface
and subsurface scatter of lithic material with no associated features. An Ensor point
was present in the prehistoric assemblage. Based on the condition of the historic period
features and the poor subsurface stratigraphic integrity, this site offers little or no
potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As
a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further
research is recommended.

Conclusions

41BL1346 is a newly recorded subsurface prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age,
measuring approximately 15 x 15 m. Work conducted at the site consisted of a 100
percent pedestrian survey and the excavation of seven shovel tests. Through subsurface
investigations, it was determined that the site contained a very isolated subsurface
scatter of lithic debitage. Based on the condition and overall lack of features, absence
of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to
answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is
recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is
recommended.
41CV18 was originally recorded in 1949. At least one burned rock midden has been documented
at the site, associated with a prehistoric scatter of lithic debitage, tools, arrow points,
and pottery. The site may have been tested prior to 1962 but no documentation of
this investigation can be located. It appears that most of the site lies outside USACE
property and within pastureland adjacent to USACE property. At 41CV18’s location,
the USACE controls roughly a 35 x 80-m section of land that contains edges of the site.
During EComm’s revisit, only one positive shovel test was excavated and only a few
surficial artifacts were observed. Based on these data, it appears 41CV18 resides within
private property. Thus, a review of site condition and cultural significance was not
determined; however, based on the condition and overall lack of features, absence of
diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield on USACE property, this site offers little or
no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As
a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further
research is recommended.
41CV19 Neither the location nor presence of this previously recorded site could be verified in
the field. The environment has undergone substantial alteration since it was recorded in
1962. At that time, the lake had only been at normal pool level for roughly 7–8 years and
many areas surrounding the lake retained some pre-lake environmental elements. When
EComm revisited the site in 2010, older growth trees, dense shrub stands, and copious
deadfall dominated the floodplain. Flooding has also resulted in impacts throughout the
landscape. The site may be buried or destroyed. As a result, it is recommended as not
eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41CV1651 is a newly recorded, 85 x 70-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work
conducted at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 12 shovel
tests. Surface inspection of the site revealed that the site contained a moderate scatter
of lithic debitage and was impacted by land modification due to agricultural activities.
Shovel testing revealed that an ephemeral concentration of cultural material is present
in the upper 40 cm of the site and is localized at the crest of the land formation. Based
on the condition and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and
low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions
regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible
for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.

41CV1652 is a newly recorded prehistoric site of undetermined age. The site is an open
campsite measuring approximately 200 x 200 m. Work conducted at the site consisted
of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 24 shovel tests. Surface inspection of the
site revealed that the majority of the artifacts were concentrated on the edge of the
terrace while an ephemeral scatter was observed on top of the terrace. Shovel testing
revealed that an ephemeral lens of cultural material exists within the upper 40 cm.
Based on the condition and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and
low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions
regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible
for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41CV1653 is a newly recorded prehistoric open campsite of undetermined age, measuring
approximately 120 x 55 m. Work conducted at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey
and excavation of 10 shovel tests. Inspection of the surface of the site revealed two
ephemeral concentration areas of artifacts, near areas that have been disturbed. Shovel
testing revealed an ephemeral subsurface deposit within the upper 20 cm. Based on the
condition and overall lack of features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact
yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding
regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for
nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41CV1654 is a newly discovered, 225 x 145-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age.
Work conducted at the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of 15 shovel
tests. Inspection of the site’s surface revealed that the site contained a moderate-density
lithic scatter. Shovel testing revealed that a buried component is located from 0 to 40
cmbs. It was found that two distinctly different artifactual assemblages intermix in a
transitional zone. The subsurface component is located the western half while a large
surface scatter defines the eastern half. The site may have some potential to contribute
to archaeological research, but based on the limited data collection on the site, the
NRHP eligibility status of 41CV1654 should be considered as unknown and the site
should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further investigations may
be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP.
41CV1655 is a 125 x 40-m prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. Work conducted at
the site consisted of a pedestrian survey and excavation of nine shovel tests. During the
inspection of the site’s surface, no artifacts were observed however there was evidence
of disturbances due to flooding and road blading. Shovel tests revealed that cultural
material was present at a depth of 40–60 cmbs; however, material was collected mixed
with coarse sand and rounded gravels. Based on the condition and overall lack of
features, absence of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or
no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As
a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further
research is recommended.

Conclusions

41CV1656 consists of a surficial lithic scatter of undetermined age that extends approximately
40 x 70 m. In total, six negative shovel tests were excavated within the surficial lithic
scatter observed during the 100 percent pedestrian survey. The lack of positive shovel
tests is directly related to the very low-density surficial scatter of lithic artifacts. It
appears the majority of the recorded site is deflated and possibly located outside
of USACE property. Based on the condition and overall lack of features, absence
of diagnostic artifacts, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to
answer significant questions regarding regional or local archaeology. As a result, it is
recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is
recommended.

5.2	Summary
Of the 97 sites documented in the current study, three previously recorded sites were found
to be contiguous with adjacent sites and are recommended to be subsumed into those sites.
Of the remaining 94 sites, 20 are assessed as having an undetermined but non-negligible
potential for further research. These 20 sites are recommended as being of unknown NRHP
eligibility and are recommended for avoidance. The final 74 sites are assessed as having
no potential for additional research and are recommended as not eligible for listing on the
NRHP; no further work is warranted on these sites. Site eligibility recommendations are
summarized in Table 5-5.
