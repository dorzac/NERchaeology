ABSTRACT

On September 18, 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the Hull Transmission Line
route and the Hull Substation site east of Carthage in Panola County,
Texas. The survey was done for Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc.
for inclusion in their Environmental Assessment for the RUS. No cultural
materials were found on the surface of either area. A total of 12 shovel
tests were dug to depths of more than 1.5m but no buried archaeological
deposits were encountered. ARC concludes that the archaeological
potential of these areas is low.
AR Consultants recommends that further cultural resource investigations
are unwarranted. However, if cultural materials are encountered during
construction, work should stop in that area and the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.

I. INTRODUCTION
On September 18, 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a pedestrian archaeological
survey of a 1.983 acre block at the site of the proposed Hull Substation, and surveyed the
100-foot-wide and three-quarter-mile long corridor for the proposed transmission line
route connecting the proposed Hull Substation to an existing transmission line to the
south. The current projects, #401 (Hull Substation) and #801 (Hull Transmission Line)
are part of the Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc. 2008-2011 Work Plan (AR
Consultants, Inc. 2008), but were not fully described in that report as final details were
not yet available. This cultural resources report describes the intensive pedestrian survey
of these two projects.
The study area is located approximately 2 miles east of Carthage in Panola County,
Texas. The proposed route is 0.75 miles long and begins at the Hull Substation site, near
the intersection of Private Road 7013 and US Highway 79, and proceeds south (Figure 1).
The archaeological survey was done at the request of Rusk County Electric Cooperative
(RCEC) of Henderson, Texas to meet the USDA, Rural Utilities Services (RUS)
requirements. This report discusses the results of this recommended work.
Project #401 Hull Substation
A new substation (the Hull Substation) will be constructed on the south side of US
Highway 79. The substation is needed to improve service and provide a standby power
source for the main station that lies 2 miles to the northeast along US 79 at CR 301. The
new substation site will include an area of 1.983 acres in a field at the juncture of the
highway and a private property line.
Project #801 Hull Transmission Line
This new single pole 138-kV transmission line is needed to connect the Hull Substation
to an existing transmission line. The proposed route will go south from the southern
boundary of the substation for approximately 0.75 miles where it will connect with an
existing transmission line. The route will cross an area of alternating open fields and
some patches of hardwood trees.
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if archaeological sites were
present, how they might be impacted and make recommendations about their
significance. Various federal and state environmental legislation has a direct bearing on
the consideration of the transmission line route. The report will be reviewed by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission as part of their Section 106
review process. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
(PL-90-190), and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended
(PL-93-291).

II. NATURAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
Natural Environment
The underlying geology of the project location is mapped as undivided fluviatile
Quaternary-aged terrace deposits (Bureau of Economic Geology 1965). Quaternary
floodplain alluvium is present to the east and is part of the Sabine River floodplain. The
terrain of the study area is very gently rolling. The major soils in the project location
belong to the Cart-Wrightville association (Dolezel 1975: General Soil Map) and are
nearly level to gently sloping loamy soils on terraces. The specific soils are the
Wrightsville-Cart complex (WT) and Cart-Erno complex (CE) (Dolezel 1975: 10, 24,
Sheet 30), which consist of yellowish brown and grayish brown sandy loam at the surface
and sandy clay loam with yellowish red mottling in the lower horizons. WrightsvilleCart consists of soils in alternate low areas and moundy areas on terraces near major
streams. The Wrightsville soils have slopes of 0-1 percent and are periodically covered
by slow-moving water, while the Cart soils have slopes of 0 to 3 percent and occur on
generally rounded mounds up to 5 feet high and 300 feet wide. The Cart-Erno consists of
soils on broad terraces that form in old alluvial sediment and are frequently reworked into
a moundy landscape by wind.
Several unnamed intermittent creeks drain into Hoggs Bayou south of the study area.
The study area crosses no drainages, but some slightly marshy areas were present. These
were located in cattle pastures and contained standing water on top of the prairie grass,
likely due to heavy rainfall. Based on the US Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands
Inventory map (1980), the study area is in an upland setting.
The climate of Panola County is subtropical and humid, with average rainfall of 43.87
inches per year and high temperatures reaching 95°F in the summer (Dolezel 1975: 54).
Winter temperatures are mild, with low temperatures rarely reaching the freezing point.
The temperature generally changes suddenly due to the influences of both polar air and
warm, moist air from the Gulf. Snowfall is minimal and may not occur for several years,
but ice storms can occasionally cause damage to trees, shrubs, and utility lines.
The project area lies within the mixed pine-hardwood forest within the Piney Woods
region of Texas (Diamond et al. 1987: Figure 1). About one third of the proposed
transmission line route crosses the pine-hardwood forest, which is dominated by loblolly
pine, overcup oak, swamp chestnut, willow, oak, sweet gum, blue jack oak, bald cypress,
button bush, water elm, and swamp privet along with a dense brush undergrowth and
various forms of ground cover. The other, northern portion of the route passes through
improved pasture dominated by short prairie grasses.
The study area lies within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950), which
typically includes mammals such as striped skunk, eastern spotted skunk, raccoon,
opossum, red fox, gray fox, coyote, mink, ringtail cat, bobcat, fox squirrel, eastern flying
squirrel, beaver, white-footed mouse, cottontail rabbit, river otter, weasel, muskrat,
nutria, and white-tailed deer (Davis and Schmidly 1994). Game birds include wild

turkey, quail, mourning dove, and various waterfowl. Small raptors such as owls and
hawks are present. Southern Bald Eagles are reported to winter in several areas. The
bald eagle normally requires large trees or cliffs near water with abundant fish as a
desirable nesting environment. They normally winter along major rivers, around
reservoirs, and in other areas where carrion is available (US Fish and Wildlife Service
1995: B4). Red-cockaded woodpeckers (Hooper et al. 1980) have not been reported from
the Service Area, but it is within their historic range (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1995:
B12). Reptiles and amphibians commonly found in the project area include: southern
copperhead, western cottonmouth, western pygmy rattlesnake, western diamondback
rattlesnake, canbrake rattlesnake, Texas coral snake, bullfrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
pickerel frog, and red-eared slider (Garrett and Barker 1987). Freshwater fishes are
abundant in the major rivers and streams.
Culture History
A variety of historic and prehistoric cultural resources are known throughout the Sabine
River Watershed in East Texas, including Panola County. These include a wealth of
prehistoric Caddo Indian villages and cemeteries as well as the structural remains of
nineteenth and early twentieth century American settlements. These remains have been
described by numerous authors listed in the References Cited and are only briefly
reviewed here.
Cultural resources studies have primarily been the result of lake construction and
community development. Nearby archaeological investigations in the Sabine River basin
were carried out at Toledo Bend Reservoir, Martin Lake, and in conjunction with lignite
mining. These studies document a very limited Late Paleo-Indian and Archaic occupation
with subsequent and extensive prehistoric Caddo sites. The history of archaeological
investigations in Panola County, and the immediate vicinity, is presented in a lengthy
discussion by Taylor and Tate (1997: 9-47) in their report on the archaeological survey of
Martin Lake and the lignite mine operation. The following discussion summarizes the
culture history.
The earliest occupation appears to have been by 10,000 B.C., based on the presence of
fluted Clovis and Folsom dart points. These and other finely crafted projectiles have been
recovered in numerous places but always on the ground surface; they have yet to be
discovered in Panola County in a primary context. Distinctive projectile point styles
including Clovis (Meltzer and Bever 1995), along with Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice,
Scottsbluff, Angostura, and Plainview have been reported from more recent, disturbed or
surface contexts from the surrounding parts of Northeast Texas, but the only reported
buried Paleo-Indian components have been reported from a survey of the proposed Big
Sandy Reservoir in Wood and Upshur Counties (Perttula et al. 1986: 49). No PaleoIndian sites have been investigated in conjunction with the Martin Lake Mine (Skinner
1997).
The Archaic stage continues from about 6000 B.C. and lasts to the beginning of the
subsequent Early Ceramic or Woodland stage about 400 B.C. During this time period, the

migratory hunting and gathering cultures expanded exploitation of various ecological
niches and developed a more varied artifact assemblage. There is evidence of settling in
to the local environment and using available natural resources, particularly lithics which
resulted in the appearance of tools which were not as technologically advanced as those
found in Paleo-Indian contexts and were made using local gravels. Terraces and flood
plain projections are noted as the preferred locations for sites, but it is possible that
deeply buried sites have generally not been recognized. Throughout this period there is an
increasing number of sites, and by the Late Archaic, sites are commonly present along
tributaries of major drainages.
The Early Ceramic stage lasts from 400 B.C. to A.D. 800 and is sometimes referred to as
the Woodland stage. Although represented by the presence of exotic pottery types
attributed to the Lower Mississippi River Valley (Story 1990) and by earthen mounds
such as at the Coral Snake and Jonas Short sites (Jelks 1965; Jenson 1968). Although
generally related to the Woodland/Hopewellian cultures of the Red River and Lower
Mississippi River Valley, little information is available from East Texas for this time
period.
The Caddoan stage is considered to have evolved from the Early Ceramic and lasted until
A.D. 1680 which signals the beginning of the Historic, or Contact, period. Various
temporal, evolutionary, and cultural divisions have been offered for this time period
which is attributed to the ancestors of the historic Caddo Indians who inhabited East
Texas. Mound centers and village sites are known to occur on terraces of major streams
and in the valleys of minor tributaries. The prehistoric Caddo people were involved in
trade networks and practiced ritual burials which suggest that they were a stratified
society. Horticulture and agriculture supplemented the food stuffs obtained from hunting
and gathering (Perttula 1993). Investigations in the Martin Lake area have identified
numerous prehistoric Caddoan sites; probably the best known of these sites is the Oak
Hill site (Cruse 1995).
The Caddos were still living in East Texas when the first Spanish explorers visited the
area (Perttula 1992: 31) but permanent Spanish settlement in the area did not begin until
the late 1600s in response to French intrusions at Matagorda Bay and in western
Louisiana. The ethnohistoric Caddo have been described by several writers but the
archaeology of these historic Native American groups is poorly known (Clark and Ivey
1974; Jones 1968), although the historic Allen and Kinsloe phases have been described.
In the 1760s, the Spanish abandoned the area of East Texas although they retained
ownership until 1803. Settlers began to occupy the Martin Lake area in the 1830s. Many
of these early people arrived via Trammel’s Trace which was the earliest route through
the area (Winfrey 1961) and roughly coincides with County Line Road in Rusk County.
Land in Panola County was divided into small parcels with farming communities tied to
the logging industry. However, lumbering was on a small scale basis due to the restricted
transportation system (LaGrone 1979). The pattern of small land holdings, farming, and
lumbering continues to this day.

Previous Investigations
No cultural resource sites are listed on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA)
within or immediately adjacent to the proposed transmission line right-of-way. In fact, of
the five sites recorded on the Carthage, TX 7.5’ USGS map, the four nearest the study
corridor are located over two miles south of the study area around Sixmile Creek. These
include late prehistoric campsites located in the creek floodplain, and a historic house site
that has likely been bulldozed. No cultural resource sites listed on the National Register
of Historic Places, at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, or as a Texas
Historical Marker will be impacted by the planned system improvements (Awbrey and
Dooley 2005; TASA 2008).
Other investigations conducted recently in and around Panola County illustrate the
archaeological landscape in the region. Prehistoric sites in this part of the Sabine River
Watershed are frequently found in elevated settings situated close to perennial streams or
to perennial springs, and historic sites are not frequently found in the floodplains and are
more commonly found near transportation routes. An archaeological survey of pipeline
routes for the South Murvaul Water Supply Corporation (Perttula and Nelson 1999)
which is located southwest of the study area recorded four prehistoric lithic scatters on
upland ridges and toe slopes. In addition, site 41PN176, a prehistoric lithic scatter, was
recorded in the floodplain of an intermittent tributary to Murvaul Creek (TASA 2008).
AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner 2006) conducted an archaeological survey of a pipeline
route east/southeast of Buncombe and recorded a Caddoan hamlet on a knoll adjacent to
Indian Creek. A similar study was done in the Murvaul Creek Floodplain but no sites
were found (Todd 2006). South of the present study area, AR Consultants, Inc.
conducted an archaeological survey of a 75x75’ cell tower padsite near Center (Shelton
2007). No significant cultural resources were discovered during the pedestrian survey of
the padsite or the associated access road.

III. METHODOLOGY
AR Consultants conducted a pedestrian survey of the proposed 4000 foot long
transmission line route and substation location on September 18, 2008. The line will
connect with an existing power line corridor in the southern end and proceeds north close
to the intersection of US 79 and Private Road 7013 where the substation will be located.
The first section of the proposed transmission line route is positioned in a relatively dense
pineywood forested area (Figure 2). The remaining portion is along an existing fence line
in an improved pasture (Figure 3). The proposed substation is located on the same
improved pasture adjacent to US 79 and has been disturbed by underground pipelines. No
water saturated areas were crossed in the forested area or the improved pasture.

A two-person crew from AR Consultants surveyed the transmission line ROW with a 10
meter interval between each other covering the 70 to 100 foot wide corridor. Due to the
ground visibility being low at 10-30 percent for most of the transmission line route,
shovel tests were placed 100 meters apart. Two small areas with very shallow standing
water overlying the prairie grass were not shovel tested. An auger was then used to
continue down to 155 cm or until the soil became too compact. The soil was screened
through ¼ inch mesh to determine if cultural material was present. A total of eight shovel
tests along the proposed transmission line route and one for each corner of the proposed
substation were excavated and are described in Table 1.

IV. RESULTS
This portion of the report is divided into two parts. The study area is discussed first
followed by a description of the survey. Shovel tests are generally described in the text
with specific information listed in Table 1. Shovel tests locations are plotted on Figure 4.
The Study Area
The study area consists of woodlands where pines, oaks and elm trees are common, along
with improved pasture land with short prairie grasses. The ground visibility was poor to
fair (10-40 percent) and thus shovel testing was necessary for most of the transmission
line and in the proposed substation. The ground surface was relatively flat in the forested
area in the south and slightly hilly in the improved pasture. The study area lies between
an unnamed tributary to the north and Hoggs Bayou to the south and these flow primarily
towards the east. Much of the area has been disturbed by oil and water pipelines, and well
pads.

A third of the 70-100 foot wide corridor route passes through a wooded area where the
ground surface is not in a wetland situation. Once the forested area is crossed at a fence
the land changes to an improved pasture with short prairie grasses and some scattered
large trees. The remaining portion of the transmission line ROW follows a fence line
immediately adjacent to the west all the way to US 79.

The Survey
The survey began at the southern end perpendicular to an existing power line corridor
that crosses through the wooded area. Since the ground visibility was relatively poor
shovel testing was required in the wooded area that extends for approximately 500
meters. Four shovel tests were conducted with ST2 through ST4 extending to 155 cmbs
and ST1 to 68 cmbs. Various colors of gray and brown sandy loams mixed with some
silty loam were the predominant soil type in all four shovel tests. Mottled reddish clays
and clay loam inclusions were located of lower levels for shovel tests two and four. Once
the improved pasture was encountered, four more shovel tests were dug with similar
results as those from the wooded section. The proposed substation location adjacent to
US 79 had a shovel test placed roughly in each corner 100 meters apart since the corners
were not staked. The shovel test results were similar to those of the first four in the
wooded area. In all the 12 shovel and auger tests encountered no cultural material and
none were observed on the ground surface.
Conclusions
Survey of the transmission route and the substation site failed to find any evidence of
historic or prehistoric occupation on the Late Quaternary fluviatile terrace deposits that
are present. Parts of the area had been disturbed by clearing, plowing, and pipeline
installation but this did not result in bringing evidence of buried site deposits to the
surface. Furthermore, deep augering within the entire project area failed to find any
artifacts below the surface. Modern historic residences are present in the surrounding area
and prehistoric sites have been reported along the Sabine River and its tributaries
elsewhere in Panola County. The absence of archaeology at the Hull Substation site and
transmission line route is attributed to the lack of drainages that carry water through the
area on a regular or seasonal basis, but could also be attributed to the low and in some
cases concave terrain which collects surface water but only contributes to flowing
springs/creeks after seeping through the underlying sands and clays. Consequently, it is
our conclusion that this is an area of low archaeological potential.

V. RECOMMENDATIONS
AR Consultants, Inc. believes that no significant cultural resources will be impacted by
the construction of the proposed substation and transmission line and that further
archaeological investigation are unwarranted. In the case of anything cultural discovered
during construction the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should
be notified and work should immediately cease until professional consultation has been
concluded.
