Abstract
IDS Engineering Group of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Medina Consulting, Inc., also
of San Antonio to conduct an environmental and cultural assessment of 1.577 acres that serves
as a drainage easement between the cities of Converse and Universal City in Bexar County,
Texas. Medina Consulting, Inc. in turn sub-contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct the cultural resources survey. The proposed project will prevent
further erosion that could potentially impact a developed subdivision along the northern edge
of the drainage. Funding for the cultural resources survey was provided by the city of Universal
City. As such, Antiquities Permit #6740 was issued by the Texas Historical Commission.
Tierras Antiguas conducted a thorough pedestrian survey of the surface area on December 19,
2013, and six shovel tests were excavated. No evidence of either historic or prehistoric cultural
material was observed either on or below the surface. As such, no artifacts were collected or
curated. In addition, no potentially historic structures were observed adjacent to the project area.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommended that IDS Engineering be allowed to develop the
tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any previously
undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development, work should
immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and evaluated by
Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.

Project Setting
Geology and Soils
The local geology (Barnes 1982) within the project area is of Quaternary Alluvial Terrace
deposits (Qt), a combined depositional sequence of Austin Chalk (Kau), undivided Navarro and
Marlbrook Marl (Knb), Pecan Gap Chalk (Kpg), and Uvalde Gravels (Qtu). Edwards chert is
a common gravel component across the region, a result of down-cutting of the Edwards Plateau.
Edwards chert and the Uvalde Gravels both provided Native Americans a rich resource for lithic
tool production.
Soils
There are two different
soil types within the
Project
Area.
Approximately 50
percent of the project
area is Houston black
gravelly clays (HuC) that
are shallow to deep,
floodplain deposits
found on convex slopes
and valley walls in this
area of Bexar County.
The
remaining
approximately 50
percent of the area are
Tinn and Frio soils (Tf),
found on frequently
flooded gentle slopes

(Taylor et al. 1991).
Climate, Flora, and Fauna
The physiographic makeup of Bexar County is a combination of four distinct physiographic
regions of Texas: the Edwards Plateau, the Balcones Escarpment, the Blackland Prairie, and the
South Texas Gulf Coastal Plain (Figure 6). More specifically, the Project Area lies within a
transitional zone on the lower Balcones Escarpment region where it gives way to the Blackland
Prairie. As such, this micro-environmental zone can still be classified as upland prairie. In
addition, the Project Area lies within the Balconian vegetation area as defined by (Blair 1950;
Map 2013; Figure 7). The annual average rainfall is about 28 inches (77 centimeters), with 194
growing-season days per year (Taylor et al. 1991).
The Edwards Plateau physiographic region of Texas exists in the northern portion of Bexar
3

County where the group(s) which
occupied it were advantageously able to
exploit an ecotone encompassing
riverine, upland, and semi-arid adapted
plants and animals. The Edwards
Plateau, with elevations reaching 2,250
ft. above mean sea level (amsl) in
northern Gillespie County (Allison et
al. 1975:76), is a hilly region, gradually
sloping to the southeast, and ending in
the escarpment running across the
middle of the sub-region (Figure 6).
The most common flora observed on
the plateau include juniper (Juniperus
ashei), plateau live oak (Quercus
fusiformis), Texas persimmon
(Diospyros texana), honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa), and agarita
(Berberis trifoliata) (Blair 1950:112;
Van Auken 1988:45; Simpson 1988).
Due to overgrazing by livestock and
restricted range fires, much of the
plateau has been overtaken by juniper Figure 6. Physiographic regions of Texas
in modern times (Buechner 1944:703- (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg).
704; Van Auken 1993:199-210).
The Balcones Escarpment separates the
Edwards Plateau from the lower
blackland prairies to the east. It is a
fault zone, consisting of blocky
limestone, chalk, shale, and marl. The
escarpment slopes to the southeast from
about 700-1,000 feet above mean sea
level (Taylor et al. 1991:119). The most
economically important floral species
are riparian nut trees, including oak,
walnut, and pecan that thrive along the
rivers and creeks (Van Auken 1988:55).
The intertwined diversity in biotic
resources existing along the escarpment
provides an ecotone in which humans
could exploit a wide variety of plants
and animals from season to season
(Collins 1995:366; 2004). The presence

of prehistoric cemeteries found in areas along the escarpment where seasonally rich food
resources such as nut-bearing species, particularly acorn and pecan trees, and prickly pear tunas
may not be just a coincidence (Hall 1995:633-647).
The Blackland Prairie is a rolling and well-dissected plain representing the extension of the true
prairie that runs through the center of North America. The prairie was once dominated by
tallgrass species such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon
gerardi), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), and silveus
dropseed (Sporobulus silveanus). Oaks (Quercus species), elms (Ulmus), cottonwoods
(Populus), and native pecan (Carya illinoinensus) are common along the drainages.
The South Texas Plain is the western extension of the Gulf Coastal Plain. It is a nearly level to
rolling plain that is moderately dissected by major river drainages through its northern half and
by numerous intermittent drainages, and the Bordas Escarpment in the south. It was originally
an open grassland mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecans, and ash (Zanthroxylum fagara)
were common along streams (Black 1989:12; Hester 1980:31, 33).
Both the plains and the
prairies have apparently
undergone dramatic
vegetational changes
over the past 300 years.
Due in part to
overgrazing and rangefire suppression, much
of the original
vegetation has been
replaced by woody
invader species,
transforming the
grassland into what we
know today as the
âSouth Texas Brush
Countryâ, dominated by
mesquite, huisache,
granjeno or spiney Figure 8. Southeast portion of Project Area from N3267501

lotebush, whitebrush, and cenizo (Black 1989:14-16; Hester 1980:34-37). As shown on the cover
photo and in Figure 8, the Project Area in Universal City has apparently been cleared, used as
pastureland, and now secondary growth mesquite and huisache is again overtaking the land.

Cultural Context and Chronology
Introduction
The Project Area is
located within SouthCentral Texas, and as
such, prehistoric
cultural affinities most
common to South
Texas plains cultures
and
Central
Texas/Edwards Plateau
hill country cultures are
often manifested in
archaeological sites
near the Project Area
(see Figure 9). The
most basic chronology
of the Central and
South Texas regions
can be divided into
either: (1) prehistoric
cultural groups with no
specific tribal
affiliation, or; (2)
h i s t o r i c a l l y Figure 9. Map of Central and South Texas Archaeological Regions
documented groups and Edwards Plateau.
with a designated tribal
or band name. Before Spanish soldiers and Catholic missionaries arrived in Texas, the cultural
activities of the groups of prehistoric Native Americans who inhabited the two regions can only
be surmised from what we can glean from the archaeological records at undisturbed, and welldocumented sites. Historic cultural groups are those observed firsthand by the Spanish soldiers
and priests beginning in the late 1600s. The Spanish then began recording in writing the names,
numbers, and living conditions of the many groups of Native Americans who lived in the
regions. However, as we will discuss later in this section, there is a significant transition era
between the least archaeologically known prehistoric cultural groups, and the historic Native
Americans that the Spanish documented; that transition era occurs in the 1500s when Spanish
explorers and treasure seekers ventured through Texas.
The Prehistoric Chronology
Based on research in Texas over the past 70+ years, beginning with professionals from the
University of Texas at Austin, archaeologists have been able to segregate the prehistoric period
in Central and South Texas into the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. Although
6

other archaeologists have made significant foundational contributions to our current
understanding of how past cultures changed through time (e.g., Story 1985; Prewitt 1981), in our
opinion the most current and widely recognized chronologies are those offered by Michael
Collins (1995; 2004) for Central Texas, and Thomas Hester (1995; 2004) for South Texas.
Paleoindian Period (11,500-8,800 years ago)
With minor differences observed in the archaeological record across the wide expanse of Central
and South Texas, this period spans the past years estimated at between ca. 11,500 and 8,800
years ago (Collins 1995:381â383; Hester 1995:433â436). Diagnostic artifacts include a unique,
fluted, finely flaked, and blade-shaped spear or dart point called âClovisâ, other stone tools
chipped on both sides, and unique prismatic blade-like flakes systematically knocked off from
river cobbles. Archaeologists have documented Clovis-age sites in Central and South Texas such
as killsites, quarries, stone tool caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Collins
1995:381â383; Hester 1995:433â436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts
are fairly common in Central and South Texas; however, no campsites or killsites have been
found south of Bexar County (Hester 1995:434â435).
During this 2,700-year Paleoindian period around the project area, the Native Americans we
term as the Paleoindian culture were likely one of small bands of nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and
horse that are now extinct in North America (Black 1989). Nevertheless, when big game was
not available, we have archaeological evidence that the Paleoindian peoples supplemented their
diet by eating turtles, tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins 1995:381).
Archaic Period (8,000-1,200 years ago)
Primarily, by studying the differences in the stone tools, the diversities in campsites or other
types of sites, the locations of the sites, as well as many other measurable and analytical
observations such as ethnobotanical and faunal remains found at Central and South Texas
archaeological sites, archaeologists have been able to dissect about 6,000 years of our past into
what we commonly term the âArchaicâ. Based on these same aforementioned affinities, the
Archaic has further been defined in terms of the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic, and the Late
Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8,800-6,000 years ago)
The region was most probably occupied by small groups who moved almost constantly during
the Early Archaic period. Archaeologists have observed a distinctive change in projectile point
styles that are unique to this period; they include Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched
dart points. Although they were still very much hunters and gatherers, the large animals such as
mammoths that their Paleoindian ancestors had hunted were by this time extinct. To survive,
they capitalized on exploiting the other abundant food resources that Central Texas had to offer
Texasâsuch as deer, fish, rodents, prickly pear tunas, and various plant bulbs and tubers.
Archaeologists point to the increased numbers of ground stone, firecracked limestone used in
cooking ovens larger in size than normal campfires, and specialized stone processing tools as
evidence that Native Americans refocused their pursuit of foodstuffs (Weir 1976; McKinney
7

1981; Story 1985; Collins 1995; Hester 1995).
Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000-4,000 years ago?)
When this period actually began and ended is always debatable among archaeologists. Some
(e.g., Collins 1995) see a significant pattern in the archaeological record between 6,000 and
4,000 years ago, but others (e.g., Hester 1995) donât think the same changes were prevalent until
much later in South Texas - about between 4,500 and 2,400 years ago. Nevertheless, the climate
began changing in Central and South Texas beginning around 6,000 years ago, and a continuum
of dry climate known as the Altithermal, is believed by some archaeologists to have caused the
Native Americans to gather in larger groups. They gathered in large groups to exploit plant foods
that were more dependable than larger game animals such as bison (Sollberger and Hester
1972:338; Weir 1976:125, 128; Story 1985:40). Archaeologists have found more sites that date
to this period, and in Summer seasons the groups apparently took advantage of the numerous
prickly pear tunas and pads that thrived in the environs of South-Central Texas, as well as deer
and rabbit (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13â15; Collins 1995:383).
Later, they apparently congregated along the many creeks and rivers in the area to gather the
abundant and nutritional nuts ripening in the Fall (Black 1989). On the Edwards Plateau, they
may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large cooking ovens to steam the tanic
acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large cooking ovens were apparently
used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used within just a few years or over
several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems to be that they were used
to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin
et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of accumulated firecracked rocks
are called âburned rock middensâ in the archaeological community, but are sometimes referred
to as âIndian moundsâ by artifact collectors.
Late Archaic (4,000-1,200 years ago?)
As with our synthesis of the Middle Archaic period, differences in the traits of Native Americans
inhabiting Central and South Texas during the Late Archaic period may have occurred over
several hundred years. Whether it was a matter of cultural adaptation or an adaption to the
environment is questionable. In either case, the uniqueness seen in archaeological sites of the
two regions imply that change may have been slower in South Texas than in Central Texas.
Collins (1995) dates the final interval of the Archaic in Central Texas to approximately
4,000â1,200 years ago, while Hester (1995) believes the Late Archaic traits seen in South Texas
archaeological sites may better be defined as between 2,400â1,300 years ago. The large cooking
ovens which after repeated uses coalesced into burned rock middens, intensified during the Late
Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same
or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Although the Native Americans of Central Texas still
sought the abundant acorns, prickly pear, and riverine plant foods such as nuts, the slightly
cooler and moister climate allowed them to pursue other food goods. Even though by about
1,500 years ago the gregarious, large herds of bison no longer predominated the now-dwindling
8

grasslands of Central and South Texas (Dillehay 1974), the Native Americans still hunted and/or
gathered deer and smaller animals such as rabbits, rodents, fish, and turtles (Black 1989:30).
Although farther south, near Brownsville and Rockport, the Native Americans inhabiting those
areas began making pottery about 1,800 years ago, those groups farther to the north, around the
Cimmaron Tributary area, either elected not to make pottery vessels, lacked the skills, or
because of their generally highly nomadic lifestyle, simply elected not to use the easily
breakable vessels until 1,000Â± years later (Story 1985:45â47). In addition to the uniqueness of
Central Texasâ hunter-gatherers not adapting to the use of pottery, archaeologists have also
observed a noticeable change in the styles/types of killing dart points used during the Late
Archaic. Keep in mind that dart points were manufactured to be used with the atlatyl, a spearlike shaft with a dart point attached to it, and thrown or launched from over the shoulder. It
would not be until perhaps 1,200 years ago that the bow-and-arrow was adapted for use for
hunting in the region. Late Archaic dart points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic
points, and the most common dart points that are found within the area are what archaeologists
call Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2013).
As with most spectrums of scientific research, there is ongoing speculation amongst professional
archaeologists as to when, and what traits mark a transition between the Late Archaic, huntergatherer practices of Central Texans and the Late Prehistoric peoples who presumably began to
settle down into territorial groups claiming a part of the landscape as their own.
Transitional Archaic (2,300 - 1,300 years ago?)
A clear and abrupt transition of Native Americans adapting or developing the traits that
archaeologists define as being inclusive to the Late Archaic period, separate from the Late
Prehistoric period, around the project area is simply not distinct in the many sites that
archaeologists have been able to excavate and analyze. In effect, some of the same
characteristics that archaeologists see in Late Archaic artifacts and earlier Late Prehistoric
assemblages left behind are nearly identical - or at least transitional in technology and style.
Therefore, some archaeologists prefer to deem this transitional period as the âTerminal, or
Transitional Archaicâ, spanning from approximately 1,200 to perhaps as long ago as 2,300 years
ago - depending on where in South or Central Texas the groups who left behind the now-present
archaeological sites were living (Weir 1976; Hester 1995). Nevertheless, the increased number
of burned rock midden sites that archaeologists have documented in Central Texas, and that date
to this time period, suggest that people returned time and again to the same sites to once again
take advantage of cooking and eating the abundant plants available during this time (e.g.,
Mauldin et al. 2003).
Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,250-300 Years Ago)
Although artifacts commonly associated with earlier Late Archaic occupations are also found
on some Late Prehistoric-in-age archaeological sites, archaeologists have documented a distinct
change in projectile point styles that Native Americans began manufacturing about 1,250 years
ago. These stone points suggest that Native Americans in the Central and South Texas regions
surrounding the Gardens at Pinnacle project area adapted the bow-and-arrow as a weapon rather
9

than the shoulder-thrown atlatyl with a dart point attached. As such, the stone points devised for
killing became much smaller and streamlined. In layman terminology, the smaller, sleeker shafts
arrow shafts carried an âarrowheadâ, instead of a dart point. Archaeologists have found Edwards
and Scallorn arrow points dating to the earliest 600+ years of the period (e.g., Goode 1991:71).
Concurrently, excavations by professional archaeologists have provided evidence that Native
Americans began using crude clay pottery vessels made from local clays, as well as perhaps
trading vessels from the South, Southeast Coastal, and Northeast Texas regions. As with any
successful venture, the making of pottery was refined so that vessels were used more, and the
technique of firing became perhaps an art (e.g., Story 1985:45-47; Black 1989:32; Hester 1995;
Nickels 2000).
Archaeologists probably know more about the Native Americans who lived in Texas during this
time than any other time in prehistory (Hester 1995). They continued to build large cooking
ovens that we commonly call âIndian Moundsâ, or burned rock middens in which they roasted
tubers nuts, and some game animals (see for example, Mauldin et al. 2003). During this same
period, the inhabitants may have increased their dependence upon bison (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991) suggests that the sudden return of bison to South and Central
Texas resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grassiness
in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north Central Texas, forming a âbison corridorâ
into the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau (Huebner
1991:354â355).
One theory is that perhaps there were not as many people occupying Central Texas during the
Late Prehistoric period (Black 1989:32). We do know that they began occupying the limestone
overhangs and rockshelters created by the many creeks and rivers cutting into the Balcones
Escarpment limestone cliffs. Examples of rockshelters occupied by Native Americans along the
escarpment include Scorpion Cave beside the Medina River in Medina County (Highley et al.
1978), Classen Rockshelter along Cibolo Creek in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967),
and Timmeron Rockshelter in Hays County (Harris 1985).
Historic Period
Beginning roughly 350 years ago, European explorers, entrepreneurs, Catholic missionaries, and
government officials encroached into what is today South and Central Texas in ever-increasing
numbers. This transitional end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in
both Central and South Texas is characterized by a continuum of written accounts of European
contact with the numerous indigenous, Native American groups encountered in the two regions.
In Central Texas, we can be ever grateful to the meticulous writings of the Spanish priests and
government officials for their recording of the names, numbers, and lifeways of the indigenous
groups. However, South Texas at the time was largely bypassed by early Euro-Americans
seeking permanent settlement. As such, the technology and lifestyles of the indigenous groups
in South Texas may have been affected by transient European influence, but today we can only
observe these changes in the archaeological record because the written accounts simply are not
available. Dr. Thomas Hester (1995) is most often credited with recognizing this transitional
period between the Late Prehistoric and the Historic, and labels this largely unknown period as
10

the âProtohistoric.â
Traveling northward from present-day central Mexico in the 1500s and 1600s, the Spanish
encountered numerous small groups of Coahuiltecans (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell
1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). In later years, intrusive groups
such as the Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche took over the lands roamed by the
Coahuiltecans (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993;
Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
For example, around A.D. 1700, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed northward
by continual Spanish expansion. But by about 1750, the Apache, adapting to a more Southern
Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting, entered what is todayâs Texas from the northwest. Their
incursion was especially rapid because they had acquired horses from the Spaniards (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27). As if the indigenous groups were not effectively dispersed and
disrupted by the Apaches, the remnants of native American cohesion that previously existed in
Central Texas were even further disrupted by the nomadic, bison-hunting Comanche from the
High Plains of Texas (Campbell 1991:111).
Thus ensued over a century of turmoil for those numerous, but splintered Native American
groups who had established a semi-permanent foothold in Central Texas before the arrival of
the Apache and Comanche. They must have been heavily traumatized and significantly
demoralized over the constant conflicts resulting in death, and the mysterious diseases caused
by the forced continual mixing and remixing among ethnicities from around the regions and the
world (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1991:345; LeÃ³n et al. 1961). Supposedly, there were dozens if
not hundreds of language dialects that were spoken by the earlier inhabitants, but nearly all have
been lost (e.g. Johnson 1994; Johnson and Campbell 1992).
Amidst the turmoil, the Spanish Catholic missions became a refuge for many of the otherwise
dispersed bands and tribes within Texas. By the early 1700s, several missions had been
established, and reestablished within the Nacogdoches and San Antonio areas (Campbell and
Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja 1995; Habig 1968a, 1968b; Hard et al. 1995). Those
that entered the missions did so usually voluntarily, seeking refuge from more powerful, warring
bands or tribes. Others did so because they were starved for food that the protective missions
could offer in seasons of natural destitution. Regardless, the Spanish government saw the
Catholic religious zeal as a means of peaceful conquest in an otherwise untenable, unsettled, and
hostile environment. At the same time, each and every Native American who relied upon support
from the Spanish missions became less of a threat to eventual Spanish domination of the region,
and infiltration by France or other countries (Campbell 1975:2; 1991:346â347).
Although a treaty with the Apaches in 1749 brought peace for a while, Apaches continued to
range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s, pushed southward
by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of Central Texas (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27; de la Teja 1995:100). In 1785, a peace treaty was agreed to in Santa Fe,
New Mexico between the Spanish Crown and the Comanches. Although the ceremony of this
11

treaty took place hundreds of miles to the west, its signing signaled the opening of a period of
peaceful coexistence in what is today Bexar County, in which Comanches brought hides, meat,
and tallow to San Antonio to trade for goods and services not available elsewhere, such as
blacksmithing and gun repair (Fehrenbach 1983:221-224; Poyo and Hinojosa 1991:125-126).
In 1821, after a hard-fought rebellion, Mexico gained its national sovereignty from Spain;
including the vast expanse that was to become the Republic of Texas. After only 15 years, the
combined Tejano and Euro-American compatriots rebelled against Mexican rule, and defeated
the Mexican army to declare an independent Republic of Texas in 1836. By the 1840s, the city
of San Antonio was well-established as the most progressive and most populated city in the
newly formed Republic. The image of San Antonio as a metropolitan magnet has been enhanced
in a continuum ever since, from Texasâ evolution into statehood in 1846, through today.

Previous Archaeological Work in the Area
The first officially recognized local (Bexar County) institution organized to promote an interest
in Texas archaeology was the Witte Memorial Museum, established in 1926. The Witte
continues to this day to promote to citizens of all ages the need to preserve our cultural
resources. Over 45 years ago, in the early 1970s, two other organizations were formed. The
Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio was born
in 1973. As the Centerâs first director, Dr. Tom Hester sought to foster a hand-in-hand
relationship among amateur collectors, landowners, and professional archaeologists. As such,
he was instrumental in establishing the Southern Texas Archaeological Association (STAA) in
1973, a dedicated bunch of individuals who were (and still are) committed to documenting and
preserving archaeological sites throughout Bexar County and South Texas.
While we will never know for sure how many archaeological sites have been destroyed, or how
many still remain in Bexar County, we do know that professional and avocational archaeologists
have managed to document nearly 2,000 over the past 40 years. Although it may seem odd that
there have been more sites recorded in Bexar County than in all its surrounding counties, and
the reader could presume that there are simply a whole lot more sites in Bexar, there are other
factors that influence the documentation of sites. For example, the largest city in the area is San
Antonio, and as such the city has many historic structures that qualify as archaeological sites that
skew the numbers in favor of Bexar County. Thanks to the cityâs historic preservation office and
codes enacted by the city, many have been recorded over the years.
It also makes sense that the more pieces of property that archaeologists are able to examine, the
more sites are likely to be found. Most archaeological projects are undertaken because of Federal
and State Antiquity codes that require cultural resource surveys be conducted when public
money (tax dollars) are used for construction, such as highways, schools, prisons, etc. In
addition, military installations and the National Park Service (NPS) are required by federal law
to evaluate any cultural resources within their lands. Because of Bexar Countyâs explosive
population growth, many military installations, and the Spanish missions administered by NPS,
12

it seems reasonable that Bexar County should have more archaeological sites documented than
in the surrounding counties. In addition, professional and avocational archaeologists and
historians have been actively involved for many years in the county.
As shown in Figure 3, multiple cultural resources surveys have been conducted within one mile
(1,609 meters) of the current Project Area. The known and documented archaeological sites
within one mile are briefly described below (Atlas 2013):
41BX15 - This site was first recorded in 1972 by Mardith Scheutz for the San Antonio Historical
Society. Subsequently, in 2008, CAR-UTSA archaeologists relocated the site during a survey
of the proposed NE Lakeview Community College locale. At that time they described the site
as heavily disturbed by the construction of a stock tank and dam, so that lithic debitage was
widely scattered. In addition, an historic trash scatter consisting of glass and metal was observed.
41BX63 - When this site was recorded by an avocational archaeologist in 1971, he described it
as a prehistoric lithic scatter with multiple stone tools, but apparently disturbed by the
construction of a stock tank. His photos of surface collections are housed at The University of
Texasâ Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
41BX1760 - This site is known as the Kruse family farmstead. It was also documented by CARUTSA during their survey of the proposed NE Lakeview Community College locale in 2008.
During the reconnaissance of the 173-acre tract disturbed by current construction activities, a
concentration of historic material was encountered in the vicinity of the Kruse farmhouse. The
historic material consisted of white earthenware ceramics, stonewares, porcelain, vinyl record
fragments, glass of various colors (green, olive, blue, milk, aqua, rose, carnival, and cobalt), wire
nails, a metal knife, hinges, a spoon, brick fragments, a leather shoe sole, a shotgun shell, and
bone fragments. Clarence (Clay) Kruse indicated that this area was the location of a cellar that
was filled in after his family left the farm in 1947. Near the concentration was a tree that was
used for hanging calves and pigs during the slaughtering process. Located to the northwest of
the historic material concentration was a capped well outlined by the footings for a structure that
Clay Kruse identified as their windmill. The historic materials noted pre-dated 1950. In close
proximity to the site (approximately 10 meters), a prehistoric biface was located in a pile of dirt
that appeared to have been created by bulldozing activities. The house no longer stood in 2008,
and the cellar had been filled in at an unknown date. The Kruse farmstead at one time consisted
of the farmhouse, a barn, a cow pen, hog pen, chicken coop, mule pen and barn, and a garden.
The property was used for farming cotton and corn.
41BX1969 - Documented in 2013 in advance of a private housing development, it is described
as an extremely sparse scatter of early stage lithic procurement debris, with minimally tested
cobbles, primary flakes, and one utilized flake. No cultural materials were found below the
surface in nine shovel tests, and no features or concentrations of artifacts were discovered during
a systematic survey of the area. A modern period historic component of the site consists of a
grade-level concrete-gravel amalgam footer for a shed, associated with an adjacent house to the
north of the project area that was constructed between 1938 and 1953.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical
framework is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems
for the South-Central Texas region. The historic framework is structured around the settlement
along the Balcones Escarpment and adjoining Blackland Prairie as documented in the earliest
written accounts by Spanish priests and government representatives, through Mexican and
Republic of Texas sovereignty, and into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic survey
methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Prefield Preparation
Before the official survey began, the Principal Investigator reviewed previous archaeological
and historical reports of investigation, both in hard copy and online, that had been conducted in
the area in an effort to better understand the potential and types of cultural resources that could
potentially be encountered during the survey. In addition, soils and geological maps were
reviewed in order to evaluate the potential depths of archaeological deposits, and the types of
lithics that may be present.
The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the tract
was conducted. In addition, numerous cutbank exposures were carefully examined. Surface
visibility ranged from 90 to 100 percent across the area. Six shovel tests were placed in a
systematic pattern across the area, in those few areas that offered a potential for intact soils
(Figure 10). The results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, and are
described in Appendix A. The shovel tests were dug in 20-cm levels, and all sediments were
screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. Following our designed research plan, any artifacts
recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm
of the backfilled shovel test.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
A full pedestrian survey of the surface and cutbanks that offered up to 100% visibility within
the Project Area was conducted, along with the excavation of six shovel tests. The surface was
very hummocky from apparent brush and tree clearing. Otherwise, fractured sandstone and soft
limestone was prevalent across the surface (see for example, Figure 11).
Portions of the drainage are shown in Figures 12 and 13. The drainage appears to have been
machine contoured in the past, but is now erratically eroded. The cutbank exposures generally
exhibit a shallow gravelly A Horizon underlain with older sediments and soils with common
limestone and chert cobbles and gravels, and dense calcium carbonates (see for example, Figures
14 and 15). No evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural resources was observed either
on or below the surface.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface and cutbanks that offered up to 100% visibility
within the project area was conducted, but no evidence of either prehistoric nor historic
occupation was found. In addition, the six shovel tests dug within the Project Area revealed
evidence of mechanical disturbance and bioturbation.
In sum, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having âno effectâ on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be allowed to proceed
without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the
Texas Historical Commission.
