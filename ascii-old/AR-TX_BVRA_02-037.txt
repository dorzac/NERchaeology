ABSTRACT
A cultural resources investigation of the proposed Gosling Road extension
between Kuykendahl and Spring Stuebner roads in north central Harris County was
conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on February 2, 1995. This
work was performed under Texas Antiquities Committee permit number 1483 and the
area investigated was 3/4 mile long with a 100 foot right-of-way. The survey did not
locate any significant cultural resources although the right-of-way passed through two
areas containing historic structures and debris. These historic sites were identified in
the field as a farm/ranch complex dating to the latter part of the 19th century and later
and a post-1950 structure made of cinder blocks that have collapsed, a large cement
slab, and an unusual, circular structure made of modern brick and mortar.
The main part of the farm/ranch complex is outside the project area right-of-way
and was not assigned a formal site number. The post-1950 structure, slab, and circular
structure not assigned a formal site number because of their recent age. It is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
Harris County plans to improve an approximate 4.13 mile segment of Gosling
Road by increasing the existing 60 foot right-of-way to 180 feet. In addition, a new
section of road will be constructed between Spring Stuebner and Kuykendahl roads for
a distance of 3/4 mile. This new section was not flagged at the time of the initial survey
by Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore 1993) and was not investigated at that
time. The 3/4 mile segment was later flagged and is the subject of this report. The area
investigated is depicted on United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5' topographic
quadrangle, Tomball (Figure 1).
The soils of the project area are depicted on Sheet 12 of the Harris County soil
survey (Wheeler 1976). According to the soils book, the majority of the project area
consists of Wockley fine sandy loam (Wo). This soil type is defined by Wheeler
(1976:232) as a nearly level soil in broad areas of prairie and forest. This soil is used
mainly for rice and improved pastures of Bermuda grass or bahia grass with limited
acreage used for timber, woodland grazing, and row crops. It is a poorly drained soil
and excess water on the surface during rainy periods is the main problem in managing
this soil.
A portion of the project area consists of Gessner loam (Ge) as defined by
Wheeler (1976:14-15). This soil is defined as a nearly level soil in broad, irregular areas
and in small, round depressions. It is lower on the landscape than adjacent soils. In
places, this soil is wet or ponded for long periods after heavy rains. Gessner loam is
used mainly for native pasture, improved pasture, and rice. It is poorly drained and is
generally saturated in wet periods.
The project area right-of-way passed through a varied terrain that ranged from
open pasture to woods. Parts of the project area were low and contained standing
water while other areas were higher in elevation. Several natural mounds were
observed rising from one of the low-lying areas. While the surrounding area contained
standing water, these mounds were dry and well drained. Much of the area was in use
as farm/ranch land as indicated by cattle and features associated with livestock such as
fences, water troughs, and outbuildings.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Harris County plans to improve an approximate 4.13 mile segment of Gosling
Road from Spring Creek to Spring Stuebner Road by increasing the existing 60 foot
right-of-way to 180 feet. In addition, a new section of road will be constructed between
Spring Stuebner and Kuykendahl roads for a distance of 3/4 mile. This new section was
not flagged at the time of the initial survey by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(Moore 1993) and was not investigated at that time. The 3/4 mile segment was later
flagged and is the subject of this report. The area investigated during this survey is
depicted on United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5' topographic quadrangle,
Tomball.
This project was sponsored by Berg, Oliver Associates, Inc. of Houston, Texas
who contracted with Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas to
conduct the field work and prepare the report. William E. Moore, SOPA of BVRA acted
as Principal Investigator and performed the field survey with assistance from Roger G.
Moore. The field survey required 16 man hours and was conducted on February 2,
1995 under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit Number 1483. The project number
assigned by BVRA is 95-01.

RESEARCH DESIGN
The objective of this study was to identify all cultural resources, if any, present
within the project area right-of-way and make a determination regarding their research
potential. This project was carried out utilizing the pedestrian survey method supported
by shovel testing. In addition to subsurface shovel testing a visual inspection was made
of exposed areas in likely settings for prehistoric or historic sites. The entire project
area was walked by two archaeologists following linear transects and separated by
each other by an interval of approximately 30 feet. In the field the investigators used a
project map supplied by the client and USGS topographic maps.

RESULTS
The survey did not record any significant cultural resources, although the right-ofway passed through two areas containing historic structures and debris. The first
locality is in the northern segment just to the north of F.M. 2920 and consists of a farm
or ranch complex with house, outbuildings, and corrals. The house is outside the rightof-way and has been destroyed by fire. Based on the presence of cut nails and
handmade bricks, it is probable that the house was initially constructed during the latter
part of the 19th century. The only portion of this historic site within the right-of-way at
the time of the survey was one of the pens or corrals. Because the main part of the site
is not in the project area right-of-way, this locality was not formally investigated and
recorded as a historic site and no artifacts were collected. The pen or corral within the
project area right-of-way is not architecturally or historically significant.
The second historic structure consists of a post-1950 structure made of cinder
blocks that has collapsed, a large cement slab, and an unusual, circular structure made
of modern brick and mortar. Although the function of the circular structure is not known
to the researchers, the presence of a windmill base nearby suggests that is was used
as some sort of water feature. Several large oaks were observed on the site which is
situated on a natural rise above the surrounding low-lying areas. Virtually all of the high
ground was covered with the concrete slab making shovel testing not feasible. Based
on the apparent recent age of this locality, it was not recorded as a site. It is located at
survey marker 33 + 00. No artifacts were collected.
No evidence of prehistoric occupation was found; however, several interesting
areas were investigated. Three natural mounds rising above the low lying areas were
observed within the path of the right-of-way. These features resemble pimple mounds
found in other parts of Harris and nearby counties. The three mounds were shovel
tested and found to be sterile in terms of cultural materials. At the time of this survey
there was standing water in the area around the mounds yet the mounds were dry and
well drained. The soil present in each of the mounds was a sandy loam which remained
fairly consistent in color and texture until it became wet from ground water seepage.
Although the shovel tests in the mounds exceeded 80 centimeters, hard clay was not
encountered. There was no evidence of disturbance, and we believe them to be natural
geological phenomena, not created by artificial means. Sites occurring on pimple
mounds in other areas are typically shallow - within 60 centimeters. Therefore, we
believe our level of testing was adequate.
The first mound was at marker 21 + 00. Two shovel tests (ST) were dug in this
area with ST 1 from 0-105 cm and ST 2 from 0-80 cm. The second mound was at
marker 23 + 00. One shovel test (ST 3) was dug to 90 cm. The third mound was at
marker 24 + 00. One shovel test (ST 4) was dug in this area to 80 cm.

Based on the soil description in the Harris County soils book, it appears that the
mounds are located within the boundaries of the Wockley fine sandy loam mapping unit.
According to Wheeler's (1976:23) description, Wockley soils contain "areas of narrow,
irregularly shaped ridges and low circular mounds where the Wockley soil has a thicker
surface layer than the one described as representative of the series." These inclusions
make up less than 15 percent of any mapped area.
A small wooded spot in the middle of a large cleared area at marker 9 + 00 in the
southern segment south of F.M. 2920 was observed. It seemed unusual for this area
not to have been cleared. Isolated graves or small family cemeteries have been found
in similar settings. Because it was beyond the scope of this investigation to clear this
tract to look for signs of graves, further work may be warranted in order to make sure
the proposed construction will not adversely impact an isolated burial or small family
cemetery.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned with the
following stipulation. Should evidence of a prehistoric or historic site, other than that
discussed above, be encountered during construction, all work should cease until the
situation can be evaluated by the Texas Antiquities Committee. Special attention
should be paid to the area at marker 9 + 00 to make sure historic graves are not
disturbed.
