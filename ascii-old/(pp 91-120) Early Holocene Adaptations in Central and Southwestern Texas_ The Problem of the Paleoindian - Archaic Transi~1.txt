ABSTRACT
In the 10 years since a pre-Archaic transitional period between the late Paleoindian and Early
Archaic in Central and Southwestern Texas was postulated by Sollberger and Hester (1972), the
concept has been widely discussed and an increasing amount of data bearing on the problem
gathered. Interpretations of the data have differed, however, on whether the period from 8000
to 5000 years B.P. was transitional or it represented a fully Archaic adaptation following an
earlier transitional period. It also has been suggested the data are incomplete and a judgement on
the problem cannot yet be made. The differing concepts are examined along with distribution
and associations of a number of diagnostic artifacts of the period in the light of paleoenvironmental models.

INTRODUCTION
Interpretations of post Pleistocene cultural adaptations in Central and
Southwest Texas have undergone significant revision in the last 10 years
(Bryant and Shafer, 1977; Patterson, 1977; Prewitt, 1974, in press; Shafer,
1977; Sollberger and Hester, 1972; Weir, 1976a, 1976b). In Central Texas
especially, the growing body of archeological data has permitted more confident discussion of cultural process and chronology (Fig. 1).
Weir (1976a) proposed a five part division of the Archaic in the region,
based on systems theory and subsistence data. This division has gained increasing acceptance, especially for the periods following 4500 B.P. (Prewitt,
1976; Patterson, 1977; Gerstle et al., 1978; Gunn and Mahula, 1977). A
similar analysis for southwestern Texas has not been attempted. However,
Shafer (1976:5-6) notes that changes can be documented through time in
Lower Pecos Archaic point styles.
Very early Holocene adaptations in both areas remain less clear (Story,
1980:10, Bryant and Shafer, 1977:20). Especially open to interpretation is
the nature of the transition from Paleoindian to Archaic strategies of resource
exploitation. The discussion centers on the interval from ca 10,000 years to
ca 5000 years ago.

THE STUDY AREA
The Central Texas Archaic and Lower Pecos Archaic represent distinct
extractive adaptations that are not readily equated. There are, however, reasons to examine concurrently very early adaptations in both areas at a time
when the distinct regional patterns of later periods are not as evident (Story,
1980:15; Gunn and Mahula, 1977:259-260). A number of investigators
(Johnson, 1964:55; Hester, 1971:71-73; Prewitt, 1966:221-224; Sorrow,
1968:21, 28; Sorrow et al., 1967:14; Weir, 1976a:11) recognized that
several projectile point styles recovered in very Early Archaic contexts from
both Central and Southwest Texas corresponded very closely.
Story (1980:15-20) discerned a number of "broad areal artifact clusters"
that may represent interaction spheres on the West Gulf Coastal Plain during
the Early Archaic, from 8000 B.P. to 5000 B.P. The most prominent of
these, which she terms the central cluster, occurs along and on both sides of
the Balcones faultline from north of the Colorado River south and west to the
Lower Pecos region. Story (1980:17) includes Bell County sites (Youngsport
and Landslide) in an eastern areal cluster. However, they are included in the
area of this study because of the resemblances of a good part of their Early
Archaic assemblages to those found farther south and west.
The area thus defined is more limited than that covered by Sollberger and
Hester (1972) in their transitional or pre-Archaic; somewhat broader than
that considered by Story (1980) in the central Early Archaic cluster; and
considerably broader than the San Geronimo Phase of the Central Texas
Archaic defined by Weir (1976a) and expanded upon by Prewitt (in press;
Patterson, 1977:57) (Fig. 2).

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The Balcones Escarpment (Pass, 1979:113), the heavily eroded southern
and eastern margin of the uplifted Edwards Plateau, is the most prominent
physiographic feature of the area. In Central Texas, the escarpment marks
the boundary between the Texan and Balconian biotic provinces (Blair,
1950; Fig. 3). To the southwest, it forms the boundary of the Balconian and
Tamaulipan provinces to the point in the Amistad region where the Chihuahuan province of Northern Mexico and Trans-Pecos Texas intrudes into
southwestern Texas. The Balcones Escarpment has an appreciable effect on
both temperatures and rainfall in both regions (Carr, 1967:20,26; Fig. 3).
The Amistad area presently is far more arid than Central Texas (Carr,
1967:Fig. 2).
The line dividing North America into regions of moisture sufficiency and
moisture deficiency passes through Central Texas (Blair, 1950:93). The 34 in
(863 mm) annual average rainfall isogram (Carr, 1967:20, Fig. 2) closely
parallels the Balcones faultline from the Red River south almost to San Marcos. It swings eastward and roughly parallels the boundary of the Texan and
Tamaulipan biotic provinces. While the bulk of the Texan province lies east of
the line of moisture sufficiency, it is classified as "moist subhumid" (Blair,
1950:100).

Bryant and Shafer (1977) suggested that the regional climatic differences
developed gradually; the arrival of the Postglacial period about 10,000 years
ago did not produce sudden, radical, or uniform changes in regional environments. They postulated that areas of woodland, grasslands, and parklands
were characteristic of Central, Southwest, and West Texas during the Fullglacial period, changing gradually between 14,000 and 10,000 years B.P. to
larger areas of scrub grassland. After 10,000 years B.P., the arid trend proceeded more rapidly and to a greater extreme in Southwest Texas than in
Central Texas.
Others (Story, 1980:Table I; Weir, 1976a:Fig. 4) differ, however, in noting the effects of periods of drought in the region corresponding to the AItithermal of Antevs (1955) or a two drought model proposed by Gunn and
Weir (1976:32, Fig. 2). This latter model is based on evidence of two hot, dry
periods dating from 8000 B.P. to 6000 B.P. and 5000 B.P. to 4000 B.P.,
separated by an interval during which temperatures approached those of the
present. Story (1980:7) suggests that the two drought hypothesis is more

96

useful than either the gradual change model of Bryant and Shafer (1977) or
the single long drought of Antevs (1955).

THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD
Terminology is not the least of the problems in discussing the period from
10,000 B.P. to 4500 B.P. Some of the chronologies and period labels that
have been used are summarized in Table 1. The distinction between the Early
Archaic and Paleoindian periods is somewhat arbitrarily and variably defined.
Story (1980) begins the Early Archaic at about 8000 B.P., approximately the
time late Paleoindian lanceolate points fade from the archeological record.
The distinction between Paleoindian and Archaic was defined in the past
(Suhm at al., 1954; Krieger, 1964; Willey and Phillips, 1958) not only by
differences in projectile points and lithic technology, but by differing subsistence bases. Paleoindian culture was seen to consist of nomadic hunters dependent on specific species of big game; while the Archaic was defined as "the
stage of migratory hunting and gathering cultures continuing into environmental conditions approximating those of the present" (Willey and Phillips,
1958:107). Suhm et al. (1954:18) saw the Archaic as a "bridge" between the
nomadic Paleoindian hunters and settled, pottery making, agricultural societies.
Johnson (1964:92) observed that the Archaic probably did not evolve
from a general Paleoindian type, and that the Paleoindian and Archaic
should be viewed as culture types rather than stages. Bryant and Shafer
(1977) postulated that outside of the High Plains, hunting and gathering was
the primary economic adaptation as early as 12,000 years ago. This initial
prehistoric adaptation, termed early lithic (Shafer, 1977), existed in large
areas of Texas woodlands and parklands between the Plains and Eastern
Woodlands, including Central and Southwest Texas.
A sudden shift from Paleoindian to fully developed Archaic lifeways
seemed unlikely to Sollberger and Hester (1972:327), although they placed
the transition later. They believed the change proceeded slowly, lasting from
8000 B.P. or earlier to 5500 B.P. or later in both Central and Southwest
Texas. The end of the transition coincided with the end of the Altithermal.
Sollberger and Hester (1972) borrowed the term pre-Archaic from
Caldwell (1958:8-11). He used it to refer to a transitory period in the southeastern United States characterized by a highly varied lithic assemblage that
differed from both the preceding and succeeding periods in that area.
Caldwell (1958) believed the assemblage represented a period of highly mobile small bands.
Sollberger and Hester (1972) felt those circumstances were paralleled in
Central and Southwest Texas. In their tentative formulation, they called attention to the diversity in projectile point forms in both areas. These forms
preceded in the archeological record the Early Archaic projectile point types
(Suhm et al., 1954; Suhm and Jelks, 1962). They represent occupations
earlier than the Early Archaic defined in periodizations of the Archaic (Johnson et al., 1962).

McKinney - Paleoindian/Archaic Transition Problem

97

Projectile points referrable to the pre-Archaic in Texas had triangular
blades, expanding stems with slightly concave bases, and exhibited certain
Paleoindian like traits such as parallel flaking and dulled stem edges. Corner
notched, expanding stem points (Gower, Martindale like, and Uvalde like)
characterized the earlier part of this period, while heavily barbed, basally
notched Bell points and a variety of triangular points characterized the later
part.
Small numbers of bifacially and unifacially flaked lithic tools and an occasional grinding slab also were traits of the transitional period. Culturally, the
period was seen to represent the localized continuation of late Paleoindian
lifeways changed only by the introduction of new projectile point styles.
Weir (1976a; 1976b) placed the period within the Archaic. He called it the
San Geronimo Phase, earliest of five postulated Central Texas Archaic
phases (phase used in the sense of Willey and Phillips, 1958:22). He set its
temporal limits from about 8000 B.P. to 4500 B.P. and drew attention to its
continuity with and within the Archaic while not necessarily disputing its developmental nature.
Weir (1976a) saw the Central Texas Archaic phases as periods of stability
reinforced by negative feedback, separated by abrupt periods of disequilibrium. The San Geronimo Phase was defined as "a system of hunting and
gathering that is loosely structured, nonspecialized, and is poorly delimited
spatially" (Weir, 1976a:50). Influences from both east and west are evident in
the San Geronimo. The small, widely scattered sites of the phase are found
on small knolls or terrace remnants.
Unlike Sollberger and Hester (1972), Weir (1976a:50,124) included
Angostura points in the San Geronimo; but like Sollberger and Hester
(1972), he placed Early Barbed, Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde points early
in the phase, Bell and triangular Tortugas points later. San Geronimo tool
types included Clear Fork and Guadalupe gouges, thick triangular and ovate
bifaces, and a variety of trimmed flakes. Late in the San Geronimo, burned
rock accumulations and oval middens appeared along with broad hearths on
flat surfaces.
Prewitt (1974:Fig. 7) tentatively proposed a Central Texas period based on
radiocarbon dates he called "Transitional Early Archaic-Late Paleoindian,"
for which, apparently, Angostura, Martindale, and Gower points were
diagnostic. Later, expanding on Weir’s (1976a) work, Prewitt (1981, in
press) subdivided Central Texas prehistory from the end of the Paleoindian
period through the post Archaic into 13 phases. The first of these, the Circleville Phase (8000 B.P. to 7000 B.P.) is a transitional period that included
the earliest manifestations of Weir’s (1976a) San Geronimo Phase, Archaic
economic adaptations, and late Paleoindian lithics such as Angostura, GoIondrina, Meserve, and Scottsbluff points. Circleville is represented by sites
such as Levi (Alexander, 1963) and Tombstone Bluff (Prewitt, 1974).
If the Circleville Phase were to be extended to the Amistad area, it would
include (Prewitt, 1981) components such as the Golondrina occupation at
Baker Cave (Hester, 1979a). Prewitt (1981) further subdivided Weir’s

(1976a) San Geronimo Phase into the San Geronimo (7000 B.P. to 6000
B.P.) and Jarrell (6000 B.P. to 5000 B.P.). Jarrell includes some of the later
manifestations of Weir’s (1976a) San Geronimo Phase. Triangular projectile
points, however, which Prewitt (1981) termed Baird and Taylor after Kelley
(1959) and Sorrow (1969:19) to distinguish them from the more southerly
Tortugas type, are assigned to the subsequent Oakalla Phase (5000 B.P. to
4500 B.P.).
In the Amistad region, Shafer and Bryant (1977) tentatively adapted a
projectile point chronology developed by Collins (1974), placing Baker,
Bandy, and early barbed points in an Early Archaic period (Period B, 9000
B.P. to 6000 B.P.). Golondrina, Angostura, and early stemmed forms were
placed in Period A (before 9000 B.P.) immediately following the Paleoindian
period characterized by Plainview and Folsom points.
The net effect of the past 10 years has been a realignment with the Middle
Archaic of the previously defined Early Archaic (Johnson et al., 1962), which
Weir (1976a, 1976b) termed the Clear Fork Phase; and redefinition of the
term Early Archaic to designate the period proposed by Sollberger and Hester
(1972) as the pre-Archaic (Story, 1980:10-11).

THE SITES
More than 40 sites have yielded evidence of some sort of very Early Archaic
occupation (Table 1). Most are found in or near the transitional zone between
the Edwards Plateau and Gulf Coastal Plain (Story, 1980; Fig. 2). This situation may be a result either of selective attention to the area by archeologists; or
actual differences in aboriginal residence patterns during the Altithermal
droughts.
Principal criteria for selecting sites were diagnostic artifact forms (Table 2).
However, inventories (Table 2) are not meant to imply primary associations
of all artifacts found in each component. Furthermore, distribution of an artifact style, or even of an apparent assemblage, does not necessarily imply a
concomitant distribution of economic strategies (Story, 1980). Differences
through time in diagnostic artifacts do not necessarily imply changes in subsistence adaptations (Bryant and Shafer, 1972:21).

Gower projectile points are among the most pervasive indicators of very
Early Archaic occupations in a large part of Texas. Gower and Gower like
points were reported from at least 20 localities (Table 3, Fig. 3), stretching
from Val Verde County (Devil’s Mouth, Johnson, 1964) in Southwest Texas,
along both sides of the Balcones faultline, to Hood County (Acton site, Blaine
et al., 1968) in Northcentral Texas. Southeastward, Gower points were reported in Victoria County (Fox and Hester, 1976), almost on the coast.
Gower was first proposed as a type by Shafer (1963) at Youngsport, Bell
County. In general appearance, Gower points show a close affiliation with
Archaic projectile points and look like very crude Pedernales points (Shafer,
1963:64). Kelly (1979a: 13) suggested Gower points probably were misclassifted in the past because of their basal similarity to Pedernales. He noted the
poor workmanship of most Gower points. Kelly’s (1979a) conclusion (based
on edge wear patterns) that Gower artifacts may be hafted knives or scrapers
has been disputed (Patterson, 1979; Shafer, 1979).
Despite their notable resemblances to Archaic projectile points, Gower like
points with basal and stem edge smoothing in the Paleoindian style were
reported from at least five localities: Devil’s Mouth (Johnson, 1964:55,Fig.
17J), Strohacker (Sollberger and Hester, 1972), Granite Beach (Crawford,
1965), Merrill (Campbell, 1948; Sorrow et al., 1967:25), and McCann
(Preston, 1969). Lateral stem edge smoothing may not, however, be evidence of any relationship to Paleoindian traits. Pedernales projectile points
recovered from very early levels often show lateral stem edge smoothing.
Those from McCann (Preston, 1969) were found in the same level with the
smooth stem edge Gower like points.
Of the 22 sites and watersheds (Table 3) that have yielded Gower or Gower
like points, only one is not an open site, i.e., the Devil’s Rockshelter (Prewitt,
1966). Twelve are buried sites: Devil’s Mouth (Johnson, 1964); Devil’s Rockshelter (Prewitt, 1966); Willeke (Fox and Hester, 1976); St. Mary’s Hall
(Hester, 1978a, 1979a); Granberg II (Hester and Kohnitz, 1975); Greenhaw
(Weir, 1979); Jetta Court (Wesolowsky et al., 1976); Crumley (Kelly, 1961);
Merrill (Campbell, 1948); McCann (Preston, 1969); Landslide (Sorrow et
al., 1967); and Youngsport (Shafer, 1963). While the Jetta Court specimens
(Wesolowsky et al., 1976:Fig. 11 e-f) were identified as Gower, Hester
(1979b:6) recently expressed doubt about that classification.
At the Greenhaw site (Weir, 1979), a Gower like point (termed Gower II)
was found in the lowest stratum of Midden F (largest midden on the site).
Weir’s (1979) Gower Variety I (found in Midden C) was comparable to Baker
projectile points from Baker Cave (Word and Douglas, 1970:21).
The three Crumley projectile points recovered from near the boundary
between Strata 1 and 2 at the Crumley site (Kelly, 1961) were noted by
Shafer (1963:81) to be similar to Gower points from Youngsport. Crumley
points, among the earliest projectile points recoverd at the site, have shallowly notched bases, poorly developed shoulders, and serrated blade edges
(Kelly, 1961:247-249).
Eleven of the Gower sites are represented by surface collections: Strohacker (Sollberger and Hester, 1972); four sites at Camp Bullis (Gerstle et al.,
1978)~ Cibolo Creek (Kelly and Hester, 1976)~ 41BC65 (Weir, 1980);

Tombstone Bluff (Prewitt, 1974); Lake Thunderbird (Duke, 1977); Granite
Beach (Crawford, 1965); and Acton (Blaine et al., 1968). Comparisons with
artifact assemblages at stratified sites and observations of relative patination of
earlier artifacts within assemblages from surface sites provide a degree of
temporal placement.
At Strohacker (Sollberger and Hester, 1972), for example, Paleoindian
and pre-Archaic artifacts except one (an exotic Plainview point) were patinated. At the Camp Bullis sites (Gerstle et al., 1978:81-83), Gower points, at
least one Guadalupe tool, six of seven Martindale points, and most other preArchaic points characteristically were patinated, as were Paleoindian points.
The later Archaic points were not patinated. The seven Gower points recovered from the Lake Thunderbird site (Duke, 1977:Fig. 3k-p) were patinated
heavily as was the "Unknown type" point (Duke, 1977:Fig. 3a). This latter
point appears much like the "Other Paleoindian Points" of Johnson
(1964:Fig. 17L) from Devil’s Mouth.
In addition to Gower artifacts reported from localities in Table 3, Watt
(1938:Fig. 26, Nos. 16-18) illustrated three dart points with deeply indented
bases, roughly rectangular stems, weak to moderately strong shoulders, and
triangular blades. These points were reputed to be among typical projectile
points commonly found in Waco sinker camps in Northcentral Texas along
the Brazos River and its middle drainage. Watt (1938:Fig. 26, No. 24) also
illustrated a corner notched point with a Martindale like stem.

McKinney -- Paleoindian/Archaic Transition Problem

Bell projectile points also have gained status as an indicator of the Early
Archaic. Their geographical range of occurrence appears to be very much
wider than Gower. Bell was defined as a type at the Landslide site (Sorrow et
al., 1967:12, 14, Fig. 10a-j). It has a resemblance to one of the Early Barbed
projectile points found at Devil’s Mouth (Johnson, 1964:Fig. 11o). Bell or
Bell like points were recovered from 15 localities (Table 4). Nine of these also
have yielded Gower or Gower like points.
The identification of a Bell like point at La Perdida (Weir, 1956) could be
challenged, since reports of Bell points from that part of Texas are lacking. At
La Perdida, Weir (1956:PI. 9o) recovered a Shumla projectile point in surface association with both Paleoindian and Archaic points. The slightly expanding stem and convex base conform to the Bell type (Sorrow et al.,
1967). It also has the hint of an indentation in the convex base similar to some
of the points illustrated in Sorrow et al. (1967:Fig. 10b). Whether this is a Bell
point is difficult to confirm without knowing the thickness of the La Perdida
specimen.
Parker and Mitchell (1979:Fig. 1) illustrate five Bell like points recovered
from a sand hill site (41CB64) in Crosby County on the eastern edge of the
Llano Estacado, far from the area of most other Bell occurrences. They point
out apparent similiarities of the Bell type to Calf Creek projectile points in
eastern Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, and southern Missouri (Story,
1980:16-17). They also compare one of the Crosby County Bell points to
some of the provisional Charcos points reported from Coahuila, Mexico, by
Heartfield (1975:136, Fig. 2o). Parker and Mitchell (1979) suggest Bell
points are not restricted to Central and Southwest Texas and may be part of
an Early Archaic dart point series with much wider distribution.
The Bell like projectile point recovered at Devil’s Mouth was one of a group
from the deepest Archaic level that Johnson (1964:33-34, Fig. 11j-s) termed
"Early Barbed." The group had in common long barbs formed by basal
notches and wide, thin triangular blades. The great variability among the
group prevented Johnson (1964) from considering it a point type and most
subsequent investigators have followed suit. The early barbed, expanding
stem, early corner notched, early side notched, and early triangular (some of
which may be Bell preforms) categories badly need to be sorted out and a
standardized nomenclature adopted.
The Early Archaic sites under consideration contain a wide variety of tools.
However, in many cases, the tool assemblages recovered from very Early
Archaic levels are not noticeably distinct from those of Archaic occupations
higher in the site (Wesolowsky et al, 1976:39). At other sites, there is little
apparent distinction between late Paleoindian and Archaic tool assemblages
(Blaine et al., 1968; Alexander, 1963). Numerical analysis (Weir, 1976a;
Gunn and Weir, 1976) suggests a difference in tool assemblages from the San
Geronimo to the succeeding Clear Fork Phase; but the distinction diminishes
later in the Central Texas Archaic.
The tool kit predominating in the San Geronimo Phase (comprising irregufar bifaces, six unifacial forms, two core forms, burin truncations, and burin
spalls) shares most of its tool types with tool kits predominating later in the
Archaic. It is relatively unspecialized, seemingly intended for grooving, cut-

ting, and shaping. The Guadalupe tool is the only distinctive tool of the period. This tool in conjunction with Gower or Bell projectile points serves as an
indicator of the San Geronimo/pre-Archaic in Central Texas (Hester and
Kohnitz, 1975:22).
Guadalupe tools were recovered from 13 of the Early Archaic localities
(Table 5). Four sites also yielded Gower or Gower like projectile points and
four sites yielded Bell points.
Panther Springs Creek (41BX228; Jaquier et al., 1979; Black, 1980)
yielded a number of Guadalupe tools both in situ and from backhoe trenching. One Guadalupe tool was recovered in association with a concentration of
burned limestone that may have been a hearth (Jaquier et al., 1979). The
San Geronimo/pre-Archaic assemblage included Guadalupe tools found in
situ in a "Transitional Zone" that also yielded bifacial Clear Fork tools and very
Early Archaic points.
Other Guadalupe tools were recovered from backhoe trenching as well as
bifacial and unifacial Clear Fork tools, Early Archaic points, and triangular
bifaces (Black, personal communication). Bell and possible Angostura points
were reported from the site (Black, 1980:6). A radiocarbon date (Black,
personal communication) of 5330 + 170 B.P. (TX 3912; Masca calibration)
was obtained from material recovered in Level 9 of Area I, an area in which
San Geronimo/pre-Archaic artifacts were concentrated. Most of the Early
Archaic artifacts recovered in that area, however, concentrated on higher
levels (Black, 1980:9).
Guadalupe tools were found at sites along San Miguel Creek in Frio and
McMullen counties (Hester, 1968:Table 1), although not on sites from which
Bell points were recovered.

Weir (1980) noted that Guadalupe gouges were found at 41FY135. This
site, near~ LaGrange (Texas) was excavated by archeologists for the State
Department of Highways and Public Transportation. A Guadalupe tool was
recovered from the surface at 41BX196, San Geronimo.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Efforts of Sollberger and Hester (1972) to focus attention on a period of
Southwest and Central Texas prehistory preceding the Early Archaic (Johnson et al., 1962) and following the Paleoindian period resulted in redefinition
of the Early Archaic. Manifestations previously thought of as Early Archaic
now are seen as more closely aligned to the Middle Archaic. Definitions of the
temporal and spatial limits of the redesignated Early Archaic still are tentative,
although early and late periods are being accepted.
Several Early Archaic projectile point types were defined (Gower, Bell,
Martindale, Uvalde) and accepted as temporal diagnostics (Story, 1980).
However, a projectile point type comparable in significance to the ubiquitous
Pedernales point of the Middle Archaic is lacking (Black, personal communication). Most projectile points from Early Archaic contexts fall into an illdefined assortment of forms sharing some gross morphological features such as
triangular blades and side or corner notches. Forms vary from site to site and
even within a site.
Gower and Bell points, among the better Early Archaic diagnostic artifacts,
are found in both Central and Southwest Texas. The Bell type in particular
appears to represent an Early Archaic phenomenon not confined to Central
and Southwest Texas. Projectile point types in the Lower Pecos, where they
are comparable, appear to anticipate similar types in Central Texas.
Subsistence data for the Early Archaic in Central Texas largely is lacking.
There is nothing upon which to form an hypothesis as clear as Weir’s (1976a;
Gunn and Weir, 1976) postulated Middle Archaic dependence on deer and

114

the acorn crop. Only in Southwest Texas, where conditions were ideal for
preservation of nonlithic cultural remains, is the subsistence base during Early
Archaic times fairly clear. Very little evidence (Shafer and Bryant, 1977) has
been found for change of exploitive strategies over time since about 8000
B.P.
Study of the Central Texas environment (Gunn and Mahula, 1977) indicates the post Pleistocene climate in that area was highly variable, even during
the Altithermal. Analysis of lithic technology in Central Texas (Gunn and
Weir, 1976) indicates readaptation to frequent environmental change was
characteristic of the Archaic.
Benedict’s (1979) hypothesis that High Plains and Great Basin populations
moved to refugia in the Central Rockies and Pacific Northwest during the two
severe droughts of the Altithermal provides a model by which to interpret the
apparent concentration of Early Archaic sites along the Balcones Escarpment. Increasing aridity could have induced aboriginal Central Texas populations to concentrate in the Hill Country as Central Texas environmental conditions approached those normal to the Lower Pecos region.
Adaptations to those conditions may have been borrowed from populations whose culture had long since adjusted to arid conditions and the biota of
the Chihuahuan province, forming a "sphere of interaction" (Story, 1980).
The wide distribution of some Early Archaic point types and undefined forms
would be a result of this borrowing. The mesic interval peaking around 5500
B.P. would have relaxed environmental pressures enough so that later Early
Archaic populations could move out on the coastal plains again. A second
adaptation to arid conditions would have been required during the second
lobe of the Altithermal toward the end of the Early Archaic.
The two drought model of the Altithermal reinforces the concept of an
Early Archaic of at least two periods based on projectile point sequences.
Until a series of reliable radiocarbon dates is available for the Early Archaic in
Central Texas to provide absolute chronological underpinnings, periodizations of the Early Archaic remains on shaky ground.
