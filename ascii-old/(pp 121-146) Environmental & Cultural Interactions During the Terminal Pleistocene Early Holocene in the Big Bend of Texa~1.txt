ABSTRACT
Environmental and cultural data spanning the period 13,000-9000 B.P. in the Big Bend are
summarized and discussed. A hypothetical construct of human adaptation to a changing environment during the early Holocene is offered. The construct is based upon extant data from Big
Bend, the lower Pecos River, northern and central Coahuila, and northern and western TransPecos Texas. It is postulated that the eastern Big Bend ultimately may prove to contain the
earliest indications of a transition from Paleoindian to Archaic lifeways in Texas and north central
Mexico due to a unique combination of climatic, biotic, and geologic circumstances existing
during the period 11,000- I0,000 B.P. The primary stimulus for such an adaptation was a mixing
of xerophilous woodland communities with Chihuahuan Desert species in an eastern Big Bend
biotic refugium. This mixture resulted in a vegetation assemblage of maximum potential for
human extractive subsistence economies.

INTRODUCTION
In a general sense, the principal topic is the availability and relationship of
Big Bend resources and landforms to prehistoric human populations of the
terminal Pleistocene-early Holocene. In order to understand and fully appreciate human adaptation through time, it is necessary to understand the environmental context in which such adaptations operated. Toward that end,
an attempt is made to provide a hypothetical construct of cultural environmental interaction for early inhabitants of the Big Bend and adjoining regions.
The construct offered may serve to stimulate renewed interest in this archeologically poorly known region.
Big Bend generally refers to that portion of Trans-Pecos Texas which is
surrounded on three sides by a long, southward sweep of the Rio Grande
River. The Big Bend region is considered to include the southern half of
Brewster and Presidio counties in Texas and northern portions of the states of
Chihuahua and Coahuila in Mexico. A large portion of this area is contained
within Big Bend National Park, which lies at the southern tip of Trans-Pecos
Texas (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 Location of the Big Bend region in the Chihuahuan Desert (adapted from
Schmidly, 1977).

Big Bend is situated in the east central portion of the Chihuahuan Desert,
one of the highest North American deserts in terms of both maximum and
mean elevation above sea level (Wells, 1977). Physiographically, Big Bend
lies within the southern portion of the Basin and Range Province (Wauer,
1973a). It consists of a terrain that contains high desert mountains surrounded by extensive gravel surfaces, dissected bajadas, volcanic outcrops,
massive limestone canyons, alluvial valleys, and high fiat topped mesas.
Elevations range from less than 2,000 ft (ca 600 m) above sea level in the
vicinity of Maravillas Canyon on the east to as high as 7,835 ft (2,374 m) at
the summit of Emory Peak in the Chisos Mountains.

Biologically, the region is quite diverse, containing some of the best preserved habitats to be found anywhere in the expansive Chihuahuan Desert.
Luxuriant flora, dominated by broadleaf trees and shrubs, are found along
the floodplains of the few perennial streams of the region, primarily between
elevations of 1,800 ft (545 m) to 4,000 ft (1,212 m) above sea level. Between elevations of about 1,800 ft (545 m) and 3,500 ft (1,060 m), a desert
shrub environment dominates the landscape. This zone contains a variety of
more widely spaced, relatively low growing desert species and includes many
succulents and semisucculents. A generally low growing sotol-grassland prevails just above the desert flats where precipitation is somewhat greater at
elevations of 3,200 ft (970 m) to 5,550 ft (1,667 m).
In still higher elevations, from about 3,700 ft (1,121 m) to 7,800 ft
(2,364 m), the dominant vegetation is of woodland broadleaf and coniferous
composition. Moist woodland assemblages, including Arizona cypress, pine,
and oak, are interspersed within this latter vegetational zone at elevations
from 5,000 ft (1,515 m) to 7,200 ft (2,182 m). Descriptions of modern botanical communities of the Big Bend region are provided in McDougall and
Sperry (1957), Warnock (1970), Wauer (1973a), and Johnston (1977). A
modern vegetational transect through the region is provided in Figure 2 (after
Johnston, 1977:341). Modern vegetational patterns are quite complex due
to variability in topographic, edaphic, and climatic influences.
The fauna of the Chihuahuan Desert also is quite diverse, including 119
species of mammals (Schmidly, 1977), 100 species of native fish (Miller,
1977), 170 species of herpetofauna (Morafka, 1977), and 385 species of
avifauna (Wauer, 1973b). Although broad faunal-floral relationships and
patterns are discernible in the Big Bend region, in many cases it is difficult to
correlate fauna with specific vegetational zones due to habitat overlap and
inherent faunal adaptability.
Although the rugged Big Bend country has been characterized as harsh
and uninviting (Tyler, 1975), it contains an abundance of plant and animal
resources sufficient to sustain a variety of cultural systems. Geologic resources
conducive to human utilization also are plentiful across the Big Bend region.
These resources include numerous rockshelters and caves, providing shelter
and safety from the elements; frequent stone free silt and sand deposits in a
wide variety of environments for open air habitation sites; and innumerable
stone resources, offering a variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary outcrops and cobbles as source materials for the production of tools,
weapons, and construction materials.
Contrary to the situation in many areas of North America, ecological and
paleoenvironmental studies in the Trans-Pecos have been pursued more rigorously than cultural investigations (Albritton and Bryan, 1939; Wells, 1966;
Meyer, 1977). Major archeological research was conducted in the Big Bend
during the 1920’s through the early 1950’s at a time when field methods
generally precluded collection of samples for special studies related to environmental reconstruction.
One exceptional study explored the relationships and association of archeological materials with geologic deposits west and north of Big Bend National Park (Kelley et al., 1940). However, this investigation did not focus on

the terminal Pleistocene largely due to a regional scarcity of recognizable
Paleoindian occupational remains.
Archeological investigations carried out since 1954, because of their primarily Iocational nature, have done little to clarify early chronological sequences or specific environmental-cultural relationships in the region. They
have, on the other hand, greatly expanded the available data concerning site
densities, site types, and general settlement patterns and should prove of
considerable aid in the development of research designs for future work
(Campbell, 1970; Tunnell and Mallouf, 1975; Baskin, 1976, 1978; Mallouf
and Tunnell, 1977; Marmaduke, 1978).
Due to interregional similarities in material assemblages, archeological research in the Lower Pecos to the east has heavily influenced interpretations of
researchers working in the less intensively studied Big Bend region. Archeologists in the Lower Pecos, working with the Archaic stage, have treated
cultural development as a relatively homogeneous phenomenon. Strati-

graphic and chronological markers arbitrarily divide the continuity into definable periods or working units (Johnson, 1964; Story, 1966.)
Extensive excavations and radiocarbon dating of deposits at Lake Amistad
facilitated formulation of a comparatively sound chronological sequence
based primarily on projectile point styles. This temporal sequence on occasion has been applied in slightly modified form to morphologically similar
implements found in a variety of contexts in the contiguous Big Bend region
(Marmaduke, 1978). However, applications of the Lower Pecos temporal
framework to the Big Bend should be considered tentative in the absence of
empirical validation.

PALEOENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Although still relatively poorly understood, the Late Pleistocene and Holocene environments of the Big Bend region gradually are becoming better
known as a result of several active avenues of research: palynology, vertebrate paleontology, paleobotany, and geomorphology. While data forthcoming from these disciplines do not always concur, certain broad patterns of
significance to environmental reconstruction are nevertheless evident. Figure
3 provides a chronologically structured synthesis of major contributions from
sample localities within or adjacent to the Big Bend region. The table is arranged by major categories of research (pollen, Neotoma sp. middens, plant
macrofossils, fauna, and geology) in an attempt to illustrate interdisciplinary
discrepancies and gaps in the data base.
Pollen data, based primarily on Martin and Mehringer (1965), Meyer
(1973), Bryant (1974), and Bryant and Shafer (1977), suggest a cool, moist
climate in which woodland, parkland, and scrub grasslands thrived across
much of the Big Bend region during the terminal Pleistocene (13,000-11,000
B.P .). A major constituent of this biotic assemblage across both lowlands and
uplands appears to have been pinyon pine, which today is found only in the
higher elevations of regional mountain ranges. This interpretation generally is
supported by wood rat (Neotoma sp.) midden analysis from Maravillas Canyon, Burro Mesa, Dagger Mountain (Wells, 1966) and Guadalupe, Quitman,
and Hueco mountains (Van Devender and Wiseman, 1977; Van Devender
and Spaulding, 1979).
The normally excellent state of preservation and relative ease of identification of plant macrofossils in wood rat middens would appear to make them
the more reliable indicator of past environments (Wells, 1976). There are
differences in content between reported middens from the eastern edge of the
Big Bend and those from areas to the north and west. Middens from very low
elevations (660 m or 1,980 ft) in Maravillas Canyon (Wells, 1966) along the
eastern extent of the Big Bend reveal a terminal Pleistocene mixture of
xerophytic woodland species (pinyon pine, juniper, algerita, live oak, and

Mallouf - Big Bend Pleistocene/Holocene Observations

127

prickly pear) in association with more arid adapted species, such as lechuguilla, acacia, and sotol. These latter elements are characteristic of the present
Chihuahuan Desert region.
Fossil middens in higher elevated areas of the Chihuahuan Desert support
a dominance of pinyon juniper woodland "... from 600-1,495 m [1,9804,934 ft] on limestone from the Guadalupe Mountains in the north to the
Hueco Mountains in the west to the Chinati and Chisos mountains in the
south" (Van Devender and Wiseman, 1977:14). The northern and western
samples, however, are distinguished by an absence of lechuguilla and other
typical Chihuahuan Desert species.
This factor would seem to support Well’s (1977) contention that the low
elevations of the eastern Big Bend (Fig. 4) served as a refugium for such
species during the downward displacement and spread of woodlands in the
Pleistocene. In addition, it would indicate that a subsequent gradual spread of
Chihuahuan Desert species during the early Holocene (11,000-9,000 B.P.)
followed a south-and-east to north-and-west progression. Wells (1966) estimates a Pleistocene downward displacement of pinyon-juniper-oak
woodlands to some 800 m below their present lower limit, implying their
presence during 14,800-11,560 B.P. across vast basins and lowlands now
dominated by creosote bush (Larrea sp).
Both Wells (1966, 1977) and Van Devender (Van Devender and Wiseman, 1977; Van Devender and Spaulding, 1979) provide reasonable arguments for the widespread existence of xerophytic woodlands in Big Bend
during the terminal Pleistocene. As a whole, the pollen data appear to support such an inference. However, there is at least one potential interpretive
problem area in the region of Cuatro Ci@negas in central Coahuila. The area
is 150 mi (250 km) to the south of the Big Bend region, in roughly the south
central portion of the Chihuahuan Desert (Minckley, 1969; Meyer, 1973,
1975).
This small, intermontane valley has an average elevation of ca 2,442 ft
(740 m) and is surrounded by mountains rising as high as 9,900 ft
(3,000 m). Although the floor of this basin falls well within the elevation range
of Big Bend Late Pleistocene woodland assemblages, pollen evidence from
Cuatro Ci~negas (Fig. 3) would seem to indicate relatively stable, unchanging
desert shrub communities there during the last 30,000 to 40,000 years
(Meyer, 1973). It may be that a heretofore exclusive reliance on pollen data at
Cuatro Ci@negas has resulted in an incomplete picture of biotic assemblages
present there during the terminal Pleistocene.
Assuming that interpretations for the Big Bend region are reasonably accurate, the environment can be reconstructed as it was seen by the first Clovis
groups to arrive sometime between 12,000-11,000 B.P. The higher mountain masses probably contained expanded conifer forest communities of ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, spruce, and other more mesophytic species (Van
Devender and Wiseman, 1977). Pinyon-juniper-oak woodlands, which now
generally are confined to elevations above 5,000 ft. (1,500 m), were displaced downward to elevations as low as 1,980 ft (600 m) in the vicinity of
Maravillas Canyon (Wells, 1966).

The broad expanses of creosote bush covered bajadas one sees today
probably were a mosaic of woodland, parkland, and scrub grassland, composed primarily of pinyon pine, juniper, oak, and grasses. Water in springs
and seeps almost certainly was more constant and available than at present
due to increased effective moisture. As a result, water courses probably were
more heavily wooded with a more diverse assortment of vegetation than
encompassing bajadas. Grass cover across the bajadas probably was much

less severe. Pollen data indicate generally wetter conditions, although Wells
(1966) suggests a relatively dry, cool climate for the lowlands (Fig. 3).
The early Holocene (11,000-9,000 B.P.), due to a gradual warming and
drying trend, saw an overall reduction in forest species in the lowlands and a
concomitant increase in woodland (oak and juniper) and grassland biota (Fig.
3). Although precipitation regimes during this period may have been changing (Van Devender and Wiseman, 1977), perennial water sources remained
much more abundant than at present.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
In comparison to environmental data, cultural data for the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene in the Big Bend are scant. The only evidence found
to date of Paleoindian presence in Big Bend proper are a few surface finds of
their distinctive projectile points. Campbell’s (1970) survey of Big Bend National Park took him to several hundred archeological sites. Campbell reports
finding only one Clovis and four Plainview-Golondrina points during the
course of his survey, facts which led him to speculate that Paleoindian occupation in the region was sporadic at best (Campbell, 1970:71). Evidence of
Folsom occupation is lacking. Similar finds in areas immediately adjacent to
the park and in northern Mexico are quite rare and often poorly documented.
To the west and north of Big Bend, Paleoindian materials are found more
consistently and in greater quantity. Evidence of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview occupations are found to the north in the Pecos, Texas area (Hamilton
Collection: notes on file, Texas Historical Commission); and a major Folsom
habitation site was discovered to the northwest of Big Bend near Van Horn,
Texas in the 1950’s (Lindsay, 1969). Krone (1975) reported a series of
Folsom finds from the El Paso area in the western Trans-Pecos.
East of Big Bend in the Lower Pecos region, evidence of Holocene Paleoindian activity was found in the deepest cultural levels of an extensive silt
river terrace (Johnson, 1964). At Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain, 1968),
definitive evidence of early Holocene Folsom and Plainview big-game hunting (ca 10,230 B.P.) was found at a repeatedly used bison jump. A few
surface finds of terminal Pleistocene Clovis points also were made in the
Lower Pecos region (Campbell, 1970:67). Paleoindian habitation sites have
not yet been identified in the Lower Pecos region.
Evidence of terminal Pleistocene Clovis occupation occurs from the Lower
Pecos region west across Big Bend, throughout the southwestern United
States, into northwestern Mexico. Clovis materials recovered to date in
Trans-Pecos Texas are surface finds. Early Holocene Folsom remains, on the
other hand, are reported from east of the Big Bend in the Lower Pecos region
(Bonfire Shelter) and to the north and northwest of Big Bend in the Pecos and
Van Horn, Texas areas. Evidence of Folsom occupation has not yet been
found in the Big Bend proper.
Early Holocene Plainview occupations are known to occur in the lower and
middle Pecos River areas (Bonfire Shelter and Hamilton Collection), but are

134

Texas Archeological Society

not well documented from Big Bend and areas west to El Paso. Golondrina
points commonly assigned to Plainview (Johnson, 1964; Campbell, 1970)
occur sporadically in the Big Bend proper (Campbell, 1970).

GENERAL CULTURAL-ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS
There are several factors to weigh in considering Paleoindian environmental relationships in Big Bend and adjacent regions. Evidence is lacking for use
of rockshelters or caves as habitation sites by Clovis, Folsom, or later big game
hunters. The use of Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain, 1968) by Folsom
and Plainview hunters in the Lower Pecos region was directly related to the
short term killing and butchering of large game. If Paleoindian incursions into
the Lower Pecos and Big Bend were as sporadic as findings (Dibble and
Lorrain, 1968; Campbell, 1970) indicate, then short term, open hunting
camps located on strategic, well elevated landforms for observing the surrounding terrain may prove characteristic. Long term encampments, on the
other hand, may indeed be rare and could occur in a variety of environmental
settings.
Additional considerations might have influenced cultural-environmental
interactions, specifically during the early Holocene in Big Bend. Jennings
(1957) early proposed that Paleoindian cultures in the semiarid to arid lands
of the western United States evolved a cultural tradition, termed the Desert
Culture, which was distinctly different from that of the Central Plains and the
densely wooded eastern United States. He proposed that the Desert Culture
was a more economically generalized, but basic, adaptation to greater aridity
and a concomitant lack or scarcity of large game or herd animals. It involved
intensive exploitation of plant resources as well as a variety of available fauna.
Within many regions of the southwestern United States, the Desert Archaic
is best represented in rockshelter and cave sites, where datable remains may
range as early as 11,000 B.P. (Jennings, 1957; Aikens, 1970), such dates
being comparable to Paleoindian dates on the High Plains. The Desert Archaic could be considered an alternative early Holocene adaptation as opposed to the Plains bison-hunting lifeway typified by Folsom and Plainview
remains.
With regard to areas south of Big Bend in Coahuila, Taylor (1966:61-62)
observed that:
From the earliest times of which we have knowledge to the latest there was a
cultural continuum in Coahuila, belonging to what has been called the Desert
culture . . . Many classes and types of artifacts are the same from bottom to top in
the stratigraphic sequence. Variations occur and relative frequencies change, but
without doubt it is a single cultural ~adition throughout its approximately 10,000
years.
Taylor’s (1966) Chihuahuan Desert data, the earliest dates for which are
9,540 B.P. and 9,300 B.P., were obtained from the lowest levels of cave sites
in central Coahuila. Evidence of earlier Clovis or Folsom occupation is absent.
In the central and eastern United States, there appears to be a continuum of
development from big game hunters to more diversified hunting-gathering

(Archaic) adaptations during the period 9,000 B.P. - 7,000 B.P. However,
because of a rather unique combination of climatic, biotic, and geologic circumstances in the Big Bend region during the early Holocene, similar adaptations may have been spurred at an earlier time. It is proposed that a highly
favorable ecological corridor afforded by mixed woodland and desert shrub
biotic assemblages in the eastern limb of the Big Bend region may have served
as a partial catalyst for a very early cultural transition from a nomadic big game
hunting subsistence base to more localized hunting-gathering (Archaic) adaptations. In the eastern Big Bend, such an adaptation may have occurred as
early as 10,500-10,000 B.P., a period roughly corresponding to the florescence of Folsom culture across the Plains.

EARLY HOLOCENE ADAPTATION IN THE EASTERN BIG BEND
Well’s (1966) Neotoma data from Maravillas Canyon indicate a mixture of
xerophilous woodland (primarily pinyon pine [Pinus cembroides remota],
juniper [Juniperus pinchotii], algerita [Berberis trifoliolata], shrubby live oak
[Quercus pungens and Q. grisea], and prickly pear [Opuntia macrocentra])
and desert shrubs and succulents (such as lechuguiUa [Agave lechuguilla],
acacia [Acacia roemeriana], and sotol [Dasylirion leiophyllum]) across the
lower elevations of the eastern Big Bend prior to 12,500 B.P. Sometime
between 12,500 and 12,000 B.P., the onset of somewhat drier conditions
resulted in a slight reduction of pinyon pine, an increase in scrub oak and
juniper, and a notable increase in desert species (Fig. 3).
It is likely that the greatest admixture of desert shrub with xerophytic
woodland was present in the lower elevations of eastern Big Bend National
Park and adjoining Black Gap Wildlife Refuge (Fig. 4). Wells (1977) notes
that the most extensive areas of the Chihuahuan Desert lie above 4,000 ft.
(1,219 m) and that:
The outstanding exception is the anomalous valley followed by the throughflowing Rio Grande on it circuitous course from the snows of the Colorado Rockies
to the Gulf of Mexico. In the Big Bend area of western Texas and adjacent
Coahuila, elevation along the river drops to less than 610 m (2,000 ft) above sea
level, the lowest elevation [and the most arid sector] in the entire Chihuahuan
Desert province, which extends from southeastern Arizona and southeastern New
Mexico to Zacatecas and southern San Luis Potosi.

Wells (1977) discussed the probability of the eastern limb of the Big Bend
serving as a refugium for desert vegetation during the full glacial pluvial. He
concluded that a continued pluvial downward migration of the desert zone
farther east along the lower course of the Rio Grande as far as the Lower
Pecos region would have been unlikely due to an increased precipitation
regime originating in warm, moist air masses over the Gulf of Mexico.
Based upon knowledge of the constituents of modern woodland and desert plant communities in this region, such a biotic mixture would have afforded enormous potential for food gathering. This favorable setting would
have been enhanced by good availability of water supply in the eastern Big
Bend along the river and its tributaries. Additional favorable attributes included inhabitable rockshelters and caves in the massive bedded limestone of

135

the eastern area and elevated, silt terraces along the river and its major tributaries.
The eastern Big Bend region, then, must have presented an optimal habitat
for food gathering during the period 11,000-10,000 B.P., a time corresponding to the florescence of Folsom culture across much of North America. The
development of a comparable mixed woodland-desert shrub assemblage in
the high elevations of the northern and western Big Bend and adjoining regions occurs some 2,000 years later (Van Devender and Spaulding, 1979;
Van Devender and Wiseman, 1977). Because of the unusually rich and varied assortment of plant resources available in the eastern Big Bend, it is conceivable that subsistence emphases might have experienced a somewhat pronounced shift from hunting to gathering quite early.
Coincident to this development would have been adjustments in the distribution of groups across the landscape, group sizes, and home range sizes.
These adjustments eventually would culminate in the distinctive Archaic lifestyle that characterized the following 9,000 years in this and adjoining regions.
The next problem that must be confronted is where in the eastern Big Bend
such early, culturally transitional archeological components can be expected
to be found and how they can be recognized. There are extant preliminary
data that help in generally discussing the first question. The second question,
however, is more difficult to resolve.

CURRENT RESEARCH
Since 1973, the Office of the State Archeologist has conducted a staggered
series of nonextractive archeological reconnaissances along the Rio Grande.
The study area stretches from Redford (Presidio County) downstream
through numerous canyon systems to Dryden Crossing (Terrell County), a
distance of some 275 river miles (440 km). Because of the remote and fiequently inaccessible nature of the terrain, all work was conducted in river
segments by way of canoe expeditions. Each expedition was normally of a 7
to 14 day duration (Tunnell and Mallouf, 1975~ MaUouf and Tunnell, 1977).
As a result of this work, over 150 archeological sites were recorded along both
sides of the river and in the mouths of its major tributaries in the eastern Big
Bend area (Sanderson Canyon, Panther Canyon, San Francisco Canyon,
Ca~on Caballo Blanco, Ca~on de San Rosendo, Reagan Canyon, Big Canyon, Maravillas Canyon, Ca~on de Ceferino).
Site types consist primarily of rockshelters and caves in limestone bluffs and
open campsites on elevated silt terraces. Intrasite surficial features commonly
consist of burned rock accumulations, hearths, occasional burned rock middens, burned rock talus, bedrock mortars and metates, and occasional petroglyph panels inside or in front of rockshelters and caves. Surficial cultural
debris commonly encountered at open campsites consist primarily of groundstone implements, various tools such as retouched flakes and projectile
points, and quantities of debitage in midden sediments. Within the shelters
and caves, surface remains include perishable items (cut sticks, lechuguilla

137.

and sotol quids, cordage), groundstone implements, debitage, and occasional projectile points. Temporally diagnostic artifacts observed on the surface of sites thus far are indicative of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric affiliations.
Although many open and sheltered sites appear to have the potential for
deeply buried early components, it is possible that geomorphological and
hydrological processes in the past have greatly altered or eliminated such
deposits. These factors may have directly affected the presence or absence of
such components, particularly in open silt terrace sites. Much of the river
course in the eastern Big Bend is contained within steep walled limestone
canyons which serve to narrow average river width considerably. During
floods, river waters are funneled through the narrow canyons at an accelerated rate, cutting away existing silt and gravel terraces and creating new terraces. The force of such floods is attested by the presence of jumbled up,
water worn boulders the size of automobiles in the floors of some tributary
canyons.
Most very early components contained in silt terraces fronting the river
probably have long since been removed by erosion. Exceptions to this generalization include: silt terraces at elevations high enough to avoid most flooding; and terraces that are relatively high and protected from swift river currents by fortuitously located bedrock outcrops or other natural phenomena.
This interpretation is supported by the fact that, out of 40 silt terrace sites
examined in this area, only five exhibit the definite presence of deeply buried
cultural zones. This observation is based upon examination of erosional cut
banks within numerous site areas. In main stem river reaches having broader
and more open floodplains, the percentage of deeply buried components
should increase markedly (Fig. 5). A similar situation can be expected under
favorable conditions in the lower reaches of tributary canyons.
In light of the hydrologic situation, archeologists must depend primarily on
the deep, well preserved cultural deposits in numerous extensive rockshelters
and caves for the earliest indications of hunting-gathering adaptations. Numerous, extensive dry caves, containing what appear to be very deep cultural
deposits with perishable remains, are within the Lower Canyons on both
Texas and Coahuila sides of the river (Mallouf and Tunnell, 1977). These
same sites probably contain Neotoma middens and paleontological assemblages. Rockshelters and caves containing good cultural deposits always
are well elevated above the river. Those located in bluffs too low to the river
are invariably scoured clean by rushing flood waters.
Rockshelters and caves having good potential are to be found throughout
the extensive limestone areas of the eastern Big Bend (Fig. 6). They are,
however, particularly susceptible to destruction by relic hunters, primarily
because of the ease with which they can be located and the richness of their
artifactual remains. It is essential that controlled, scientific investigations be
carried out at select sites in the near future.
In cases where such natural features were available, there appears to have
been a propensity toward rockshelters and caves as habitation sites in the
Archaic of Big Bend. While rockshelters are not difficult to locate, recognition

of transitional Paleoindian to Early Archaic components in their deposits may
pose somewhat more of a problem.
In the Lower Pecos region, the earliest components within rockshelters
have yielded radiocarbon dates of ca 9,110 to 8,500 B.P. and are characterized by lithic assemblages containing nonfluted Golondrina, Lerma, and
Early Barbed projectile points (Ross, 1965; Epstein, 1960; Word and
Douglas, 1970). To the south in central Coahuila, the earliest dated cave
occupations range around 9,500 B.P. and also are characterized by Lermalike, nonfluted points. A variety of typical Desert Archaic perishable items
include rattlesnake rattles, agave fiber sandals, twill pad sandals, and a variety
of other woven objects (Taylor, 1966).
Although similarities with these extraregional early assemblages are expected to be found in transitional assemblages in the eastern Big Bend area,
sites of the latter area additionally should reflect differences that will be attributable to an earlier shift in the balance of human subsistence from animal to
plant foods. This subsistence shift in the eastern Big Bend is expected to
predate similar adaptations in the two adjoining regions by at least 1,000
years, or as early as about 10,500 B.P. This postulation, if valid, will have
implications with respect to the development of similar adaptations in adjoining regions.

Mallouf -- Big Bend Pleistocene/Holocene Observations

DATA SUMMARY
1. Due to downward displacement of xerophytic woodlands, a desert
shrub refugium of Chihuahuan Desert species existed in the lower elevations
of the eastern Big Bend at ca 14,000 to 10,000 B.P.
2. Within this terminal Pleistocene-early Holocene refugium, desert shrub
species were mixed with xerophilous woodland species. This mixture resulted
in a vegetation assemblage of maximum potential for human extractive subsistence economies.
3. The favorability of the eastern Big Bend refugium for human occupation was enhanced by the presence of extensive, stone free terrace surfaces,
innumerable rockshelters and caves for habitation, and relatively stable water
sources.

4. Although sparse and surficial in nature, there is evidence for utilization
of the Big Bend region and the north central Coahuila region by terminal
Pleistocene big game hunters of Clovis affiliation. Early Holocene Folsom
remains have not been discovered in the Big Bend to date, regardless of
numerous, regional archeological surveys. Evidence in the Big Bend of utilization of rockshelters and caves by Paleoindian fluted point traditions is lacking.
5. By 10,500 B.P. in the eastern Big Bend, the xerophilous woodland was
in gradual retreat due to drying conditions which favored the spread of Chihuahuan Desert species. Assuming the presence of man in this ecologically
highly favorable environment, it is likely that a cultural transition to a gathering subsistence economy already was underway by this date. This adaptation
probably placed more emphasis on rockshelters as longer term habitation
sites in response to a constricting of territorial range. Specimens exhibiting
similarities to Angostura, Golondrina, and Lerma projectile points, along with
a variety of groundstone implements, will be found to characterize this very
early adaptation. An absence of Folsom remains in the eastern Big Bend may
be attributable to an attendant pre 10,500 B.P. shift in lithic technology and
tool assemblages.
6. In contrast, to the east in the Lower Pecos region, the Paleoindian big
game tradition existed until 10,000 B.P. and possibly longer due to a continued presence of parkland grasses. This grasslands may have supported bison
herds as late as 8,500 B.P. (based on pollen data). The prolonged existence
of parklands is attributed to greater influence on this area of eastern (Gulf of
Mexico) climatic regimes.
7. In the Lower Pecos region, pollen evidence exists by 9,500 B.P. for
xerophilous parkland vegetation with mixtures of desert shrub succulents.
The earliest radiocarbon dates from inhabited rockshelters and open sites in
the Lower Pecos fall within a range from 9,500 to 8,900 B.P. (Word and
Douglas, 1970; Epstein, 1960; Johnson, 1964) and are associated with nonspecialized, Archaic like assemblages. The environment at 9,500 B.P.
roughly corresponds to that of the eastern Big Bend 1,000 years earlier. This
latent correspondence suggests the concomitant spread of biotic regimes and
attendant cultural adaptive traits from west to east.

142

8. The earliest dated assemblages from northern and central Coahuila
range between 9,500 and 9,300 B.P. (Taylor, 1966) and are of a distinctive
Archaic character. These assemblages suggest the possibility of migration of
peoples and/or adaptive traits from already established Archaic traditions in
the Big Bend to the north. Unlike the more northerly regions, the transitional
Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene environmental of central Coahuila may
have remained more stable (from pollen data).
9. Neotorna sp. midden data for the higher elevated northern and western
sections of the Big Bend and adjacent areas indicate the development of
mixed xerophilous desert shrub biotic assemblages no earlier than 8,500 B.P.
or 2,000 years later than in the eastern Big Bend. Although radiocarbon dates
for cultural assemblages in these areas are lacking, it is predicted that the
earliest evidences of Archaic lifeways will roughly correspond to this late date;
such influences will have emanated, along with biotic characteristics, from
sources to the south and east in the Big Bend proper.
As one moves westward, the dates of origin of such assemblages will, for an
undetermined distance, correspondingly decrease. Because of a longer duration of parkland grassland (and attendant bison herds) in these northerly and
westerly regions, the presence of Paleoindian big game hunting traditions in
the form of both kill sites and habitation sites can be expected to occur there as
late as 9,000 to 8,500 B.P.
