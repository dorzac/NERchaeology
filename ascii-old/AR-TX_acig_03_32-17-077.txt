Abstract
On July 10 and 11, 2017, archeologists from aci consulting conducted an intensive
pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching prior to construction of the Hutto
Innovation Industrial Park in Williamson County, Texas. The first phase of the
project includes the construction of two new public roads as well as a retention
pond. The Area of Potential Effect consists of the approximately 69­foot (21­meter)
Right­of­Way (ROW) for the proposed Emory Farms Extension, 60­foot (18.3­
meter) ROW for the proposed Technology Boulevard, and the proposed regional
retention pond, totaling approximately 14.95 acres (6.05 hectares).
The investigation was conducted in accordance with Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical Commission (THC) and in compliance
with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26) under Permit No. 8092. The project is
also conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, for any additional compliance for impacts
to US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) regulated waters.
One site, 41WM1264, was previously recorded within the APE and was revisited
during this investigation. The site is not recommended as eligible for listing on the
NRHP or a SAL. The investigation did not result in the location of any new
archeological sites, historic structures, or additional historic properties. Based on
these results, no further archeological work is recommended. Records from this
investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Julie
Shipp served as Principal Investigator.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey and backhoe
trenching prior to construction of the Hutto Innovation Industrial Park in
Williamson County, Texas. The first phase of the project includes the
construction of two new public roads as well as a retention pond. The Area of
Potential Effect consists of the approximately 69­foot (21­meter) Right­of­Way
(ROW) for the proposed Emory Farms Extension, 60­foot (18.3­meter) ROW for
the proposed Technology Boulevard, and the proposed regional retention pond,
totaling approximately 14.95 acres (6.05 hectares) (Figures 1 and 2).
The investigation will be conducted in accordance with Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical Commission (THC) and in compliance
with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26) under Permit No. 8092. The project
is as also conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, for any additional compliance for impacts
to US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) regulated waters.
The investigation consisted of a site revisit to 41WM1264, an intensive
pedestrian survey, shovel testing, backhoe trenching, site recording, assessment
of sites for listing on the national Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for
designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), data analysis, and reporting
in accordance with THC and Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) standards.

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 Environmental Setting
The project area is located in central Texas in the Blackland Prairie east of the
Balcones Escarpment, a fault zone with hills to the west and north and low relief
to the east and south. The topography to the west of the Balcones Escarpment,
the Balcones Canyonlands, is hilly and characterized by the presence of springs,
karstic since, caves, and rock shelters. The Blackland Prairie is characterized by
low relief and dark clays which support prairie vegetation along with small
woods often found along low gradient streams. The project area is within the
“Crops” designation, as noted on the Texas Parks and Wildlife “Vegetation
Types of Texas” map (McMahan et al. 1984).
2.2 Geology and Soils
The APE is mapped as Austin Chalk, an upper Cretaceous geologic formation.
Austin Chalk is characterized by chalk and marl, with some interbeds and
partings of calcareous clay. Unit is below Taylor Marl, Ozan Formation, Upson
clay, Anacacho Limestone, or Pecan Gap Chalk and is above Eagle Ford
Formation or Boquillas Flag (USGS 2017).
The soils mapped within the APE are Branyon clay, Tinn clay, and Houston
Black clay (NRCS 2017):
x

The Branyon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very
slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium derived
from mudstone of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to very gently
sloping soils occur on treads of stream terraces on river valleys.

x

The Tinn series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very
slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium. These
soils are on flood plains of dissected plains that drain the Blackland
Prairies.

x

The Denton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very
slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum derived from

3.0 REGIONAL HISTORY AND CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
3.1 Prehistoric Background
The project area falls within the Central Texas archeological region (Collins
1995). Prehistoric archeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous
human occupation starting around 11,500 years ago. Michael B. Collins (1995)
authored a synthesis of Central Texas archeology in which he divides the
prehistory of Central Texas into three periods: (1) the Paleoindian, (2) the
Archaic, and (3) the Late Prehistoric. Each of these is further divided into
subperiods, such as early and late. Dates are presented as Before Present or BP in
Table 1.

6,000­4,000 BP
4,000­1,200 BP
1,200­500 BP
500 BP +

The Paleoindian period dates between approximately 11,500 and 8,800 BP
(Collins 1995:381­3). The Early Paleoindian in Central Texas is part of a larger,
regional cultural horizon, the Clovis horizon. Clovis sites record a general
hunter­gatherer lifeway based upon a wide variety of fauna including large
herbivores as well as smaller animals. Evidence of plant resources is less
common, but it is presumed that local flora was also important to subsistence. In
contrast, later Folsom sites indicate a greater reliance upon big game hunting.
The Late Paleoindian seems transitional between the Paleoindian and Archaic in
that burned rock features are present, but they are not as large or ubiquitous as
those associated with the Archaic. Other artifacts, features, and faunal remains
seem more similar to those found later in the Archaic.
Archaic (Collins 1995:383­385) sites in Central Texas are most often associated
with the use of heated rock in hearths, ovens, middens, and scatters. The period

as a whole is defined by the intensified use of local resources and diversity of
material culture in comparison to the Paleoindian period. The climate ranged
from mesic (relatively moist) in the Early Archaic and the later part of the Late
Archaic to xeric (relatively dry) during the Middle Archaic and beginning of the
Late Archaic. Subsistence during mesic times is centered on the live­oak savanna,
while a shift in emphasis toward xerophytes may have occurred during xeric
intervals.
The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups,
primarily from the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics
into the archeological record takes place in the region during this time as well.
The movement of Europeans inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended
the prehistoric era.
3.2 Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the
late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when Spanish explorers traveled
through the region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas.
Captain Alonso De León followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop
several times during the 1680s, and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de
Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and Captain Domingo Ramon, a
Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and camped on the banks of
Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them Arroyo do las
Bendítas Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, the Marques de
Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through present­
day Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions. In the mid­
eighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established along the San
Gabriel River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753 drought
and disease made the missions uninhabitable, and Spanish influence in the area
declined (Odintz 2002).
Anglo­American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In
1835 continual attacks by local Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and
his company of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the

austin • denver

headwaters of Brushy Creek in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson
Fort, as it was called, was abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded
Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several
veterans of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838 Dr. Thomas Kenney
and his family built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson
County. Kenney’s Fort became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County.
However, Indian attacks were a frequent problem, and numerous settlers,
including Kenney, were killed by Indians. By 1846 the Indian threat had waned
and settlement in the region increased. In 1848 the Texas legislature established
Williamson County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a Milam County Judge
and state senator (Odintz 2002).
By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the
San Gabriel (Odintz 2002), but a few families were living in the western half.
During the 1850s and 1860s, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up
around the county. Although urbanization and industrialization increased
somewhat, the bulk of the county remained rural and agricultural. The majority
of the families lived on subsistence farms in log houses and raised corn. During
the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave population increased and the agricultural
patterns within the county became more diverse. Wheat and corn were the
predominant crops in the Blackland prairies, and cattle and sheep ranching was
widespread throughout the county. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but it
was not a significant cash crop (Odintz 2002).
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War but picked
up again in the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the
expansion of cotton farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisholm
trail, which was established in 1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle
drives passed through or originated in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s
were also marked by the arrival of railroads to Williamson County (Odintz 2002).
By the early twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry
in importance. With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm

tenancy developed. As late as 1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by
owners. By 1890 43 percent of the farms were worked by owners, and by 1930
only 29 percent of the farms were worked by owners. The tenancy rates
continued to drop during the Great Depression (Odintz 2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of
soil depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil
infestation. The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation
and encouraged farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton
production was reduced by nearly half, while sorghum and wheat became
important crops. Along with cattle and sheep, poultry farming intensified
(Odintz 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and
1980s. The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped
areas of Williamson County meant urban populations now had easier access to
the Hill Country and vice versa. The consolidation of rural schools also meant
children could now attend schools outside of their rural communities. For
example, during the 1910s and 1920s, Rock House School was one of the largest
schools in Williamson County. In 1903, the school boasted a population of 96
students and 2 teachers. The school was consolidated with Liberty Hill School in
1947, and by the 1990s, Rock House had become a dispersed agricultural
community (Odinzt 2002).
Suburbanization of the portions of the county bordering Austin caused the
population of Williamson County to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the
population of Williamson County was 37,305. By 1982, the population had grown
to over 85,700. A pattern of absentee ownership and of non­agricultural use of
the land also intensified following World War II. Austin, Georgetown, and
Liberty Hill grew rapidly (Odintz 2002).
4.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
A literature review of the THC Archeological Sites Database (Atlas) revealed that
one archeological site has been previously recorded within the APE, and that a
portion of the APE has been previously investigated. An additional three sites

Site 41WM1264 consists of a brick­line well dating to the early 1900s. The well is
most likely related to the farmhouse on the property which is located 1,200 feet
southeast of the well. The site form, recorded in 2011, notes the well has begun to
deteriorate and collapse inward due to disuse and neglect. The house on the
property appears on historical aerials as early as 1928 (Figure 5) and is still
standing today (USGS 1928). Also on the 1928 aerial is a structure near the north
end of the retention pond that disappears sometime before the 1934 Williamson
County 63k soils aerial (USDA 1934).

5.0 FIELD METHOD
An intensive pedestrian survey was conducted within the entire 14.95 acres (6.05
hectares) APE. The survey also included shovel testing, backhoe trenching, and
site photography. Four shovel tests were excavated at least 30 centimeters (cm) in
diameter, in 10 cm levels, and the soil was screened through ¼­inch (.63­
centimeter) hardware cloth. Shovel tests were recorded on logs and the locations
of the tests were recorded on a GPS unit. The shovel tests were negative and
revealed that alluvial deposits were intact to depths beyond one meter. Two
backhoe trenches were excavated within the Tinn soil mapped along Carmel
Creek. The trenches were approximately 30 feet (9 meters) long, 5 feet (1.5
meters) wide, and excavated to a depth of 5 feet (1.5 meters).
Site 41WM1264 was revisited. The revisit consisted of a survey of the site,
photography, and a revisit site form was completed and submitted to TARL.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
The survey, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching were conducted under
pleasant conditions over two days, under a clear sky, with a light breeze. An
intensive survey was conducted within the entire 14.95 acres (6.05 hectares) APE
of the project area.
The proposed retention pond is located in the floodplain of Carmel Creek, which
was shovel tested and backhoe trenched in addition to the pedestrian survey.
The survey began at the south end of Carmel Creek and shovel tests were
judgmentally placed within the Tinn soil. After four shovel tests were excavated
to depths between 60 and 100 cm, the Tinn soil warranted deeper excavation and
thus required backhoe trenching to reach the bottom of the Holocene deposits.
No cultural material was recovered in the shovel tests.
The proposed roads run through a corn field with ground surface visibility of 50­
60 percent and since the upland soil was shallow and rocky, no shovel tests were
excavated in the proposed road area (Figures 6 and 7).

Two backhoe trenches (BHTs) were excavated where the Tinn soils are mapped
along Carmel Creek, east of the creek and west of an existing sewer line (Figure
8).
Due to the presence of site 41WM1264 and its connection to an historic farmstead
structure, archival research was conducted with the Williamson County Central
Appraisal District, Williamson County Clerk Office, and the Texas General Land
Office. The property history is outlined below and in Appendix A, followed by
discussions of the backhoe trenches and revisit of site 41WM1264.

6.1 Property History
The Republic of Texas issued Bounty land grants to soldiers who had served or
enlisted in the army of the Republic prior to October 1, 1837 (GLO 2017).
Veterans of the Republic of Texas Army were given 320 acres of land for every
three months of service. By virtue of Bounty Warrant No. 865 issued by the
Secretary of War of the Republic of Texas, 640 acres of land was issued to
William P. Patterson on December 9, 1837, for his service during the Texas
Revolution (GLO 1837). On May 26, 1841, Patterson transferred his land grant to
Philip Howard, who then transferred the land to Morgan C. Hamilton on
November 13, 1854 under Patent No. 467 (Williamson County Deed Records
Volume 12, Page 333).
Morgan C. Hamilton was born 1809 in Alabama. He moved to the Republic of
Texas in 1837 for mercantile business. He then was a clerk in the War
Department of the Republic of Texas from 1839­1845 and also acted as Secretary
of War for the Republic from 1844 to 1845. He later would be elected U.S. Senator
for the State of Texas, serving from 1870­1877. Throughout his time in Texas,
Hamilton had considerable land holdings, including 1009 acres along Brushy
Creek which would become the city of Coupland, Texas (Scarbrough 2017). As
far as the records show, Hamilton never lived or built on the 640 acres he
received under Patent No. 467.
In December of 1882, Hamilton sold 127.75 acres of the original 640 to H.W.
Miller (Williamson County Deed Records Volume 29, Page 264). The land was
sold four more times before Albert E. Wendland and J.H. Wendland purchased
214.31 acres from Claus and Nina Peterson in 1924, which included 5 tracts of
land (Williamson County Deed Records Volume 214, Page 528). The descendants
of Albert E. Wendland are the current occupants of the project area.

Backhoe Trench 1 (BHT 1) was placed on the east bank of Carmel Creek. The
trench was oriented north to south, parallel to the creek. The trench was
approximately 30 feet in length, 5 feet deep, and 3 feet wide. BHT 1 exhibited
typical Tinn series soil to a depth of approximately 150 cm below surface. where
the water table was encountered (Figure 9). No cultural material was located
within BHT 1.

6.4 Site 41WM1264 Revisit
Site 41WM1264 was revisited and relocated. The site consists of a brick­lined well
with two apparent phases of construction (Figures 11 and 12). The well was
originally dug in the mid 1920s and is associated with a homestead outside of the
APE. The homestead belongs to the Schneider Family, who currently own the
parcel the project area is located in. The homestead is located 1,200 feet to the
east­southeast (Figure 13).
The associated homestead appears on historical aerials as early as 1928 (see
Figure 5). As noted in the archival research, the ancestors of current residents, the
Schneider Family, purchased the land in 1924. It is most likely the well and
associated homestead structure were built between 1924 and 1928 by the
ancestors of the current residents.
The well is 4 feet in diameter, 9 feet deep, and currently holds 2 feet of water. A
second phase of well construction can be seen where the brick and construction
changes in parts of the above­ground walls. The well is in fairly decent shape.
The well currently sites approximately 35 meters east of Carmel Creek (Figure
14). The area now has two two­track roads which run 25 meters north and 15
meters east of the well. The land is currently used for agricultural purposes
including cow grazing.
No artifacts were observed on the surface and the ground surface visibility
within the site and around the well was good and approximately 50 percent, thus
no shovel tests were excavated. As documented in the archival research for
historic background, no historically significant persons occupied the land nor no
significant events took place. Site 41WM1264 is not recommended for NRHP
inclusion. A revisit form was completed and submitted to TARL.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On July 10 and 11, 2017, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a
pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching prior to construction of
the Hutto Innovation Industrial Park in Williamson County, Texas. The first
phase of the project includes the construction of two new public roads as well as
a retention pond. The Area of Potential Effect consists of the approximately 569­
foot (21­meter) Right­of­Way (ROW) for the proposed Emory Farms Extension,
60­foot (18.3­meter) ROW for the proposed Technology Boulevard, and the
proposed regional retention pond, totaling approximately 14.95 acres (6.05
hectares).
One previously recorded archeological site, 41WM1264, was revisited. The site
lacks historical significance and is not recommended for NRHP listing. The well
will be filled and capped prior to any construction.
The investigation did not result in the location of any new archeological sites,
historic structures, or additional historic properties. Based on these results, no
further archeological work is recommended. It should be noted that no level of
survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural features within a project
area. Therefore, should previously­unrecorded cultural resources including
human remains be discovered during the course of construction for this project,
the City of Hutto or MWM DesignGroup will contact the Texas Historical
Commission or other professional archeologist of the inadvertent discoveries.
