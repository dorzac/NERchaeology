Foreword
The Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society was organized in Abilene, Texas, in
October, 1928, for the purpose of collecting the archeological remains of Texas, their preservation in
Texas museums, and the publication of the knowledge acquired in the studies and researches incident
thereto. It was also intended that the remains of such types of prehistoric animals as have been found
associated with man’s artifacts in other parts of the world should be carefully studied and collected in
museums with the idea in view that a more careful study of American pleistocene deposits might
yield evidences of earlier occupation of America by man than had been previously acknowledged.
The members of the Society feel that the efforts of this organization have contributed no small
part to the solution of many of these problems, and especially that of ancient man in America.
From the printing of The Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society’s Publications neither
officers nor editor nor anyone else derive any financial compensation whatever. All of the proceeds
of the dues payments, and book sales are applied to make better, larger bulletins. It is a successful
experiment in pure science. The Society published its first book at the beginning of the depression in
1929. It has been published regularly every year since then. For several years the Society has owed
no debts, and it maintains a cash balance prior to publication for the printing of its Bulletins.

SOME UNUSUAL CREMATED BURIALS FOUND
NEAR COLORADO, TEXAS
BY CYRUS N. RAY
In the summer of 1929 Mr. E. W. Douthit of
Abilene asked the writer to examine some unusual
holes in large boulders, situated on his ranch in
Mitchell County. Soon thereafter the writer visited
the site and examined 84 boat-shaped or oval mortar
holes which had been made in hard sandstone on
the tops of large bed rock outcrops located along
the edge of a hill overlooking a wide flat valley.
Through this valley the channel of a shallow, dry
wash meanders its way. There are shallow pools of
water in the holes of the wash which remain for
several weeks after rains, but there is not now
enough water to sustain the life of such a large
campsite, as once existed on the hillside above the
mortar holes, closer to the site than ten miles, where
there is a spring on another small creek branch. It
was stated by a resident of the region that a spring
once flowed on a mountain across the valley about
a mile distant, but no signs of it show now.
The flint and mussel shell debris of the site above
the mortar holes would indicate a rather heavy
occupation over a long period of time, which would
have been impossible for a primitive tribe without
a permanent water supply.
In the centers of some of the largest boulders
were a few intact oval mortar holes which were
filled level with the tops with grass sod. Probably
these had filled with wind-blown earth early and
this had protected them. These protected mortar
holes were from 15 to 17 inches deep, 17 inches
long, 7 to 8 inches wide, and pointed at each end.
The outline of the holes from above is boat or canoe
shaped. (Note 1).
On most of the boulders where any slant
whatever existed, the stone had been washed away
in varying degrees, depending on how far from the
centers of the boulders the holes were. Forty-four
of them were eroded deeply. Since the flat boulder
tops and ledges are high above any chance of flood
waters causing this erosion, one must assume that
it was solely due to elements borne in the air such

as wind-blown sand and rain. It is probable that
sand was not the cause, since the erosion is not
equal but is progressive from the flat topped centers
of the stones to the edges, and much greater where
any slope exists. One then concludes that the erosion
was caused by the run off on each boulder of only
the rain which fell from above on that stone. How
long it would take rain to wear away the surface of
a hard sandstone boulder down 15 inches the writer
does not know, but of some holes only the bottom
1.5 to 2 inches still remained. Of some others
remnants 3, 4, 5 and 6 inches deep remained. (Note
2).
Later study showed that this type of mortar hole
is found in great numbers oh branches of the
Colorado River near Colorado, Texas, in a number
of different sites described in Vol. 3 of this Society’s
Bulletin. (Note 3).
Back of and close by the original mortar hole
site, a small mountain or large hill rises abruptly.
On the face of this hill lie some large overhanging
rocks. When we examined this hill in 1929 Mr. J.
E. Lowry found under a large rock a beautiful
abalone shell pendant of the type commonly made
and worn by the Pueblo Indians of Arizona and New
Mexico. The shell of which it was made is found
only in the Pacific Ocean. The finding of this Pueblo
type artifact indicates either Pueblo trade
connections that far east, or that Pueblo Indians
camped at the site. When we examined the top of
the mountain a rock structure of circular form,
consisting of large stones set into the earth closely,
was found. This rock structure was 14 feet in
diameter and consisted of one layer of stones.
Below the stones was 1.5 feet of hard, dry earth
filled with small stones. Much to our disappointment
after the hard labor of clearing the stones and earth
away under a temperature of above 100 degrees
we came to hard, flat bed rock, and apparently
projecting out of the center of this were some large
rough stones which we supposed were part of the
same ledge.

to hold back bobbed hair. Its curve would be about
right to fit the head of a small child. A large stone

always wondered about this site, after later digging
up some long headed burials in stone lined graves
which were buried 4 and 5 feet deep. In 1932 the
writer dug up a similar structure situated about 30
miles north of this site, and found a flexed long
headed skeleton, buried below the earth and stone
covering in a pit cut into the solid rock beneath it.

opening under a large boulder about half way up
the south face of the same small mountain. On
digging into the floor debris of the west end of the
small shelter the flexed, charred remains of a
cremated adult were found. This skeleton was much
better preserved than the child’s, which was reduced
to small charred bits, as large sections of the long
bones, although scorched, were otherwise nearly
intact. Four serrated arrow points, of what this
writer now believes to be the latest of several
successive phases of The Sand Dune Culture, were
found. Apparently out of the same ashes came a

much rusted metal trousers button. Whether it was
part of the clothing of the person cremated, or was
later taken into the site by rats, the writer cannot
say, but the fact is rather unsettling to some previous
views. While there is no doubt in the writer’s mind
that the top level (“Sand Dune Culture Complex,”
(Note 5), extends back far into the past based on
evidences of patination and otherwise, there is also
some evidence to indicate that this long headed race
also lived in the region late enough to make contact
with the Spaniards. In 1928 the writer found in the
bottom of a sand dune blow-out basin near Abilene

a number of typical serrated arrow points of the
Sand Dune Culture Complex of exactly the same
type as those found charred with this cave cremated
burial, and found amongst them one peculiarly made
large blue glass bead. During the summer of 1929
while Dr. Walter Hough of the Smithsonian was
here, he was shown the bead, and he then stated
that it was a Venetian blue glass bead of a type
which had not been made in the past three hundred
years. On a visit to the same blow-out on a windy
day about a year later, a long headed, flexed
skeleton, was found in position where the winds
had just exposed it. It was in the exact place where
the serrated arrow heads and the blue glass Venetian
bead were previously found. This site is located so
far from any present day water supply that it is
unlikely that two periods of inhabitation could have
occurred on the site although it is a possible
explanation. In this instance as in the case of the
cremated burial no other object showing white
contact has ever been found.
In the usual Indian burial whenever metal objects
are found one also always finds quantities of glass
beads. No beads of any kind were with the cave
cremated burial, nor any other artifacts of white
manufacture.
On digging deeper in the same cave and into a
rather firm compact tan colored soil a foot or more
beneath all evidence of the cremated skeleton
another skeleton was found which showed no signs
of cremation. It was in flexed position, lying on the
side in the east end of the small cave near the
entrance. This was of a somewhat larger individual,
and no artifacts of any kind were buried with the
skeleton. A few animal bones were found at the
same level, and with the human bones, but whether
they were left at the same time with the burial or
not the writer cannot determine.
The deeper bones, both of man and animal, have
the appearance of being rather old but well
preserved, and it is very probable that they are the
remains of a burial made a long time before the
cremated burial found in the loose ashes above
them.

The finding of the typical Pueblo type of abalone
shell pendant in the rock shelter on the west face of
the mountain and the child’s burial containing the
abundance of ground and polished stone ornaments
in the grave on the top would indicate Pueblo
culture contacts.
Another feature suggestive of this, is the finding
of several cists or pits lined with flat stones near
the mortar holes which evidently were constructed
to hold the meal ground in the mortar holes.
However, not one pottery sherd of any kind has
ever been found by the writer in that region.
Considering the differences in the methods used,
and of the burial furniture in the three burials, it is
probable that each of the three were made at
different time periods.

A PREHISTORIC CREMATED BURIAL OF THE ABILENE REGION
BY JAMES G. MORROW
The writer overheard a conversation concerning
a rock mound which had been found by some boys
while hunting on a ranch situated twenty miles
southwest of Abilene. The owner agreed to allow
an excavation after being convinced that scientific
research was the writer’s only purpose in
excavating.

one-half of a Nueces Canyon type of scored stone.
In 1934 Vane Huskey of Uvalde sent two of this
type of stones to the Editor of this Bulletin with a
request for information concerning them. Prior to
that time we had neither seen specimens, nor
descriptions of them. In Huskey’s correspondence
(Note 3) he first described Nueces Canyon scored
stones. On April 9, 1935, Mr. Huskey wrote as
follows:
“I have also found several things that have
puzzled me very much as to their use or purpose.
One is a lime stone. (I have 12 or 15 of them).
They are just common burnt rocks, about 3 inches
around and 5 to 7 inches in length and they all have
from three to nine parallel lines on them. Never
very deep. None crisscrossed as in sharpening bone,
etc.; but all of a uniform pattern like this. I’d sure
like to know their use.”
At the end was a drawing of a long oval stone
with four parallel scores down the middle.
Again on May 1, 1935, he wrote as follows:
“I am sending you one of the rocks with the
parallel lines on it. You may have it. These lines
mean something. They run from 3 to 7 generally,
sometimes, very rarely, 9 lines. I thought for a while
they were abrading stones, but no; because lines
never cross; they all run parallel.”

stones are found in and around both types of
artifacts and mounds. Of course the logical reason
would be that the later group picked up the custom
from the older group. My opinion is that stones
were used as ceremonial stones. No, you may keep
the two that I sent you. I do not need them.”
One of the Huskey Nueces Canyon scored stones
is six inches long, and 2 5-16 inches wide at the
widest portion and 1 1-2 inches thick. It is shaped
roughly in a long oval, and is almost foot shaped.
It is of gray limestone, flat on the bottom and
rounded on the top. In the center of the top is a
series of eight parallel scores 2 inches long; all are
even and of the same length.
The other of Vane Husky’s scored stones is 4 34 inches long and is a well rounded oval limestone
with the thickness and the width about the same, 2
1-4 inches. This stone is rounded at one end and
broken off at the other, and has the appearance of
the broken end of a stone pestle. It has four well
defined parallel grooves on one face which are 2 58 inches long and like the others run lengthwise of
the stone and all end even at each end.

The grooved limestone found by James Morrow
in the Abilene region grave, evidently was broken
after the grooves were made and probably is about
half of the original stone. It is 1 7-8 inches long, 2
3-8 inches wide and 1 9-16 inches thick. The convex
central portion has three parallel longitudinal scores

DISCOVERIES INDICATING A PRE-CADDO CULTURE
ON RED RIVER IN ARKANSAS
BY HARRY J. LEMLEY
The purpose of this paper is to present certain
evidences of the discovery of a pre-Caddo culture
on the Crenshaw Place on Red River in Miller
County, Arkansas. Heretofore, in so far as we are
aware, no definite report has been made of the
finding in the Red River area in Arkansas of any
evidence of a culture other than that of the Caddo.

the layer of village soil and work inward, removing
the mound as we proceeded. All of the burials in
the mound with the exception of a group of five
skulls (Group Burial No. 1) were in the south half.
In this area were found a number of burials in the
mound proper and the two intrusive pits above
referred to. In certain instances nothing remained
of burials found in the mound proper except the
crowns of teeth associated with which were certain
artifacts. In other cases, groups of deposits of
artifacts were found with no bones, the latter having
doubtless decayed. These deposits will be described
along with the burials. In all cases the burials and
groups of artifacts were found on the thin layers of
clay indicating that the mound had been built by
stages, an additional layer being added as a burial
or group of burials was made.

treat them as a unit, although they may or may not
have been buried in a group. No. 1 was found 13’

Four inches under No. 4 was a small arrowhead;
and in both Nos. 1 and 3 one small arrowhead lay
about 1’ to the east of each.
Burial No. 2, a skull headed south, with no other
bones was found at a depth of about 3’ in the

1292) of plain, light brown ware, 4 ½” tall with
small square bottom, rudimentary feet and inward
curving rim. The last coil of clay applied on the
inside had not been entirely obliterated, a feature
of some of the more crudely made pottery of this
culture. This vessel, as well as all others found in
the body of Mound “D”, with one exception, was
grit tempered. About 6” northwest of the skull was
a well-made, shallow, triangular ladle (V-1290) of
polished light brown ware. Two closely spaced
incised lines encircle the rim. This vessel had been
purposely mutilated by means of deep scarifications
which appear in clusters on the interior walls. The
scarifications, apparently pecked out, suggest the
funerary practice of “killing” vessels, evidence of
which is found in Florida and the Southwest. A like
distance northwest of the skull was a plain cookingpot of heavy polished brown ware with curving
body and broad, flat, round base, the rim of which
is missing. Scarifications, similar to those referred
to, occur on its outer surface.
Burials 4, 5, 6, and 7. In the southeastern
quadrant, four cremated burials were found, rather
close together, and at depths of from 3’ to 3 ½”, all
in pits cut down from the surface. The calcined
bones were in small fragments. No evidence of fire
was found and apparently the cremations had been
made elsewhere and the remains thereafter interred
in the mound. Moore5 reported finding a deposit of
cremated remains in this mound.
Burial No. 8. In the southeastern quadrant at a
depth of 46” was a deposit of 36 arrowheads on
each side of which and in close proximity were a
number of the crowns of human teeth, all that was
left of two skulls. Nineteen of these points are of
finely chipped pink, white and gray translucent
novaculite, from l ¼” to 1 7/8” in length and very
thin. These are of as fine workmanship as those
found by Mr. Agee and resemble them to a marked
degree, but are wider at the base and more deeply
notched. The remaining points are of jasper and
novaculite and are from ¾” to 1 1/8” in length.

Deposit of Artifacts:
In the same quadrant and on the five foot level
was a deposit of eight small, crude points. No
evidence of a skull appeared, but judging from our
experience in this mound these flints originally were
with a burial.
Group of Artifacts:
The following described group (or groups) of
artifacts was found in the southwestern quadrant
about 9 ½ north of the south edge, all on the same
thin layer of clay. At a depth of 3’, a deeply
hollowed-out boat-stone of grayish green stone,
probably sianite, notched at the ends; almost in
touch with the hollow of the boat-stone was an oval
pebble which readily nests in the stone; 29”
northwesterly of the boat-stone was a conical
cooking-pot (V-1286) of rather thin polished light
brown ware, inward curving rim, small base, with
an incised line encircling the rim, suggesting a
degeneration of the typical band found around the
rims of the better pottery of this culture; 34” north
of the boat-stone was another conical cooking-pot
of polished brown ware decorated with two incised
lines, suggesting a band, around the rim; 30” east
of this vessel was a crude asymmetrical cooking
pot of heavy dark grayish brown ware, plain, with
slightly flaring rim, thickness at base ½” and 4 ½”
southeasterly of the latter was a globular bowl of
heavy gray-ish-brown ware, 4 ¼” high and 6 ¼” in
diameter, two crudely incised lines surrounding the
rim. This is the vessel mentioned as having been
found 39” from the skull in Burial No. 2. Three
feet north of east, and the same distance from this
vessel, was an unpolished triangular celt of brown
sandstone, 3 5/8” in length; and 1’ north of the celt
were 32 small barbed points of novaculite and
jasper. Undoubtedly, these artifacts were with one
or more burials, the bones of which had totally
disappeared.

Discoveries Indicating A Pre-Caddo Culture
The remains of seven skeletons were found in
the mound. These will be referred to as “Upper
Burials”. Twelve pits, containing the remains of a
total of 70 skeletons, were found under the mound,
and a burial of two infants in the layer of village
soil at the base. With all of the upper burials, except
one which contained no artifacts, were specimens
of Caddo pottery. Of the twelve pits found, four
(Nos. 2, 3, 6 and 9) had been dug before the erection
of the mound and extended down from the layer of
village soil only. These pits, the smallest of which
was 11 ½’ x 15’, and the largest, 13’ x 22’, contained
respectively, 12, 14, 18 and 12 burials, all adults,
extended on their backs and apparently buried at
the same time. In these were a very few pottery
vessels and other artifacts, the pottery being of the
older culture, evidences of which were found in
the body of Mound “D” and the cemetery nearby.
These four pits of the older culture were filled with
sand darker than the river sand, and in which was
village debris. The remaining pits, all of which had
been cut down from the displaced surface through
the mound and into the sub-surface, ranged in size
from 4 l-3’ x 8 1-6’ to 5 ½’ x 8’ and contained in
four instances one burial each, in three instances
two burials each, and in one instance four burials,
in all of which were Caddo pottery and other
artifacts, in most cases in great profusion. These
pits had been filled in with a mixture of clay and
sand, many lumps of clay separated by sand being
in evidence, and were readily discernible from the
surrounding soil. In one instance, one of these
Caddo pits (Pit No. 5) had been cut down through
one of the earlier pit burials under the mound (Pit
No. 3) and had penetrated the sub-surface under
the last mentioned pit to a depth of 18”. In another
case, a Caddo pit (No. 8) had been cut down until
its diggers came into contact with certain skeletons
in the earlier pit (No. 3), thereupon they gathered
up the bones which they had displaced and placed
them around the ends and sides of the pit they were
digging and then refilled the grave with 10” of dirt
and made the one burial found therein.

from the surface and extended 4’ under the mound.
Directly above this pit, Pit 10 containing Caddo
burials had been dug to a depth of 6 ½’ and, in the
digging of the latter, Upper Burial 3 had been
entered at a depth of 20” and was cut through,
leaving at the outer edge of the latter pit the hip
bones and lower extremities of two adult skeletons
in the upper burial.
But little space will be devoted to a discussion
of the upper burials and the pits cut down from the
top of the mound, since both contained Caddo
burials. The pits which were dug before the erection
of the mound will be described in detail.
Pit Burials of the Older Culture:
Pit 2, situated in the southwestern part of the
mound lying in a northwesterly and southeasterly
direction, had been dug before the erection of the
mound to a depth of 2’ from the ground level and
was 12’ x l5’. It contained 12 adult skeletons buried
in two rows of six each, which were extended on
their backs with the heads toward the west. The
burials in the row to the east were parallel with the
short sides of the pit, while those in the row to the
west were placed at angles to avoid crowding. All
of the burials were lying on a thin layer of colored
sand which extended about 6” around each skeleton
but did not cover the floor of the entire pit. This
sand, found with all of the burials in the older pits,
was somewhat mottled in appearance and showed
faintly the colors white, green, red, yellow and
brown when first uncovered. Upon being removed
and after drying out, the colors disappeared. We
have had a sample of this sand analyzed and find
that it contains a large amount of oxide of iron in
various stages of hydration.

All of the skulls found in this pit, as well as those
in all of the other pits of the earlier culture, were
crushed by the weight of the earth, and the
remaining bones, while present, were in a poor state
of preservation. No evidence of violent death
appeared. Between the skulls of Burials Nos. 5 and

serrated points of novaculite and jasper (H373). Just below the left knee of No. 11 were
8 similar points (H-375), and on the chest
of No. 7 were two badly crushed delicate,
long stemmed, clay pipes (P-171-2). No
other artifacts were with these burials.
Pit No. 3, of the earlier culture, which
was found in the southeastern part of the
mound, was 13’ x 22’. It was cut down from
the layer of village soil to a depth of 2’ under
the mound and contained the remains of 14
skeletons, all adults. The intrusive Caddo pit
No. 5 had cut through this pit and the skull
and a part of the upper extremities of Burial
No. 11 and all of No. 14 except the lower
extremities had been destroyed. Likewise,
the digging of intrusive Pit 8 had destroyed
a part of the lower extremities of Nos. 10,
11 and 12. All of the burials were extended,
and the skulls were in a more or less easterly
direction with the exception of two. The
right arm of No. 6 and left arm of No. 5
were flexed. This pit contained but one
pottery vessel, a jar (No. V-1358) of brown
ware, having a flattened body and
comparatively tall neck, with a horizontal
band in low relief about the neck. Upon the
lip of the rim are six parallel encircling lines.
Incised lines on the neck remind one of bands
occurring in related specimens. This vessel
was lying between the skulls of Burials 5
and 6. Near the skull of No. 6 was a polished
bone awl, 7 ½” in length, made of the leg
bone of a deer, and at the right side extending
from the skull to the elbow were 21 small
arrow-heads (H-376) all, with one
exception, of the same type as those found
in Pit. 3. Near the left side of the skull of
No. 2 were 9 arrow-heads (H-374) and ten
arrow-heads (H-377) were at the left of the
skull of burial No. 4; 4 similar arrow-heads
(H-378) were at the left of the skull of No.

and touching the skull of No. 7 and in a crushed
condition were 3 tortoise shell rattles which
contained many pebbles. In the bottom of each shell
were two small perforations, evidently made for
the purpose of attachment.
Pit No. 6, a large pit of the older culture, 13’ x
20’, was cut from the ground layer to a depth of
about 18”, and contained 18 adult skeletons. Three
pottery vessels were with the burials: At the top of
the skull of Burial No. 6 was a large, graceful urn
(V-1375) of plain, polished gray ware, 8 5/8” tall,
having a comparatively small bottom and
rudimentary feet, curving body and flaring rim;
against the right side of the skull of No. 17 was a
vessel of brown ware (V-1376) having a cylindrical
body and square bottom with a well defined band
in relief around the rim, the lip of the rim was
decorated by two incised encircling parallel lines;
between the skulls of No. 14 and No. 15 was a
deep bowl (V-1377) of polished brown ware with
a band in low relief around the rim bisected by an
incised line. The rim lip has two incised encircling
lines. Near the skull of the No. 2 were two small
stone chisels, one of brown jasper, 3 1/8” in length,
and the other of light gray stone, somewhat
triangular in shape and 3 ¼” in length. Near the
skull of No. 4 was a small bone awl; and above the
left knee of No. 6 were 13 small arrow-heads of
jasper, similar to those found in Pit 2. At the hips
and also at the feet of No. 7 were a large number of
small pebbles, probably the remains of rattles. On
the chest of No. 5, in small fragments, were 3
delicate, long stemmed pottery pipes.
Pit No. 9, the remaining pit of the older culture,
was 11 ½’ x 15’ and lay with its southwestern corner
almost in the center of the mound. It had been dug
down from the ground level to a depth of 4’ and
contained the skeletons of 12 adults, the
arrangement of which is shown in our sketch. The
burial of skeleton No. 9 directly under the hips of
Nos. 4, 5, and 6 will be noted. Between Nos. 1 and
2 and extending over the left humerus of No. 1 and
the right humerus of No. 2 was a large well made
bowl of dark brown polished ware (V-1400), with
a wide band encircling the rim bisected by a
horizontal encircling line. Upon the lip of the rim

27

were two incised encircling lines. Between the skulls
of Nos. 6 and 7, was a small cylindrical, square
bottomed vase (V-1401) of polished brown ware.
Two bands in low relief encircled the bottom and
the top, leaving a horizontal panel upon which was
an incised continuous scroll. The usual encircling
lines were on the lip. At the left wrist of No. 2 was
a shell bead, almost disintegrated, (X-715). At the
left hip of No. 7 were the crushed remains of 3
tortoise shell rattles, (M-293) and 6 more (M-294)
all badly crushed were found at the inside of the
lower leg bones of this burial. A girdle of small
mussel shells (M-291) (sphaerium scopoli) ground
down and perforated at the umbo, encircled the
waist of No. 10.
Infant Burial:
In the layer of village soil under Mound “B” and
about 3’ westerly from the northwest corner of Pit
9, was an extended burial of 2 infants with heads to
the south, side by side, near the neck of one of which
were 5 small badly decomposed shell beads. The
infants were of the same size, approximately 44” in
length; skulls crushed, bones in a poor state of
preservation.
Caddo Burials:
The Caddo burials in Mound “B” were all
intrusive, and 3 of them, termed “Upper Burials”,
were found in the mound proper, the remainder in
8 deep pits, cut down from the disturbed surface of
the mound into the sub-surface under the mound.
In all instances these burials were extended and
pottery typical of that culture was found with them.
The pipes found with these burials are of the long
stemmed type figured by Moore10 and Harrington11.
We will describe the Caddo burials and artifacts
found with them briefly below.
Upper Burial No. 1, found at a depth of 2’,
contained the skeleton of an adult and 6 pottery
vessels.
Upper Burial No. 2, also found at a depth of 2’,
contained the skeleton of an adult and 1 pottery
vessel, 1 pipe, 1 celt and 6 small arrow-heads.

burial at a depth of 20”, leaving the hip bones and

these lower extremities, with skull toward the feet
of the adults, was the skeleton of an infant, near

drinking cup, 2 bone needles, 13 quartz crystals, 1
ceremonial knife, and a deposit of perforated mussel
shells. On each side of the skull at the cheek bones
was a large copper covered, spool-shaped ear plug.
In the digging of Pit 8, some of the burials in the
earlier Pit 3 were disarranged, as has been noted in
our description of Pit 3.

Pit No. 1, contained the remains of
two adults and was 5’ x 7 ½’ and 5’ deep.
In the burials were 7 pottery vessels, 1
celt and 3 bone implements.
Pit No. 4, 7 ½’ x 6 ½’ and 5’ deep
contained the remains of 4 adults; it had
been partially cut through in its
northeastern corner by another pit, and
the lower extremities of one of the
skeletons in Pit 4 had been removed.
Unfortunately, we did not get to dig the
lower pit. We had dug down to its level,
but during our absence another person
came in and removed the burial. We later
secured from this individual the only
entire pottery vessel found by him. It is
Caddoan in type, in our opinion. We also
saw a few fragments of other vessels
which he found in the pit. They, likewise,
were of Caddoan type. In Pit 4 were 2
pottery vessels, a mass of red paint, and
a fragment of cloth which had been
preserved by a copper ornament. The
ornament itself had almost entirely
disintegrated.
Pit No. 5 was 5 ½’ x 7’ and 6 ½’ deep,
and contained the skeleton of one adult
with 12 pottery vessels. In the digging of

This ceramic group, as Mr. Lemley has clearly
proved, can be definitely separated from the later
Caddo complex. A few culture traits, such as incised
designs, the scroll motif, and occasional
punctations, appear on Caddo domestic vessels
where they would be most expected. This is natural,
for succeeding potters would certainly have either
retained or borrowed a few cultural elements from
their predecessors.

of the vessels from the latter region is decorate with
polished bands and scrolls against a background of
punctations, which is so typical of the early

Crenshaw pottery. Here, as in pre-Caddo ware, the
principal decorative motifs occur in a horizontal
zone on the vessel body. This zone is also separated
from the vessel rim by one or more
incised, parallel lines. An incised line
sometimes occurs in the rim proper.
The majority of the sherds from the
early sites in the Bayou Macon
country, however, are cord marked.
The rims of these vessels are often
thicker than the walls, and sometimes
serrated.
The antiquity of the first culture at
the Crenshaw Place is further
suggested by its relationships to other
ancient pottery complexes southward
and eastward. According to Ford’s
researches in Louisiana and
Mississippi, the Southeastern
Hopewell culture is the earliest
pottery complex so far known in that
region.8 Incidentally, the type site of
this culture is in the Red River Valley.
The Marksville complex. Ford says,
was replaced in southern Louisiana by
the Coles Creek ceramic group, and
by the Deasonville in the northern part
of that state. 9 Both of the latter
complexes had some criteria in
common with Marksville ware. They
in turn gave way to Caddo, Tunica,
Natchez, and Choctaw pottery which
was still being produced in 1700.10

Mr. Lemley has certain similarities to
the Coles Creek complex. Some
vessel forms are similar. Coles Creek
bowls have convex bottoms, and the
pots have flat bottoms which are
sometimes square. The latter vessels

comparable. Ford illustrates a triangular rim lug
from a Coles Creek vessel which is almost identical
with two from southeastern Arkansas. So far as
the writer can discover, no reference has been made
to platters (such as those from the Crenshaw site)
in discussions of Coles Creek pottery. Both Coles
Creek and pre-Caddo vessels are tan, brown, black,
and dark gray in color, and are tempered with grit.
Perforations, and an incised line in the rim of bowls
and pots are also typical of the Coles Creek
complex. Incised lines below a vessel rim is another
feature common to both ceramic groups. Several
pots from the Crenshaw site have incised
“overhanging” lines which Ford stated is typical of
Coles Creek ware. “Overhanging lines,” as that
writer explained, “were incised with a flat-pointed
instrument at such an angle to the vessel wall that
the top of the line is deeply incised while the bottom
rises to the surface of the wall.”11
In discussing the range of the Coles Creek
complex, Ford stated that a minor portion of the
decorations of this ware is similar to designs on
vessels found by Clarence B. Moore along the
northwest coast of Florida. There is not only in
decoration, but also in vessel forms, a decided
similarity between the pre-Caddo pottery and some
of the specimens from western Florida.
Quadrilateral pots, inverted conical vessels having
square bottoms and sometimes rudimentary feet,
and ovoid bowls with circular apertures are as
common in Moore’s collections from the western
coast of Florida as they are in the Lemley collection
of pre-Caddo ware. The conical jar with a narrow
mouth (V-1443) and the lobed vessel (V-1357) from
the Crenshaw site also have their counterparts in
Florida. The elongate, oval bowl (PI. 1, Fig. 1)
which Moore found in Florida is comparable to
vessel V-1460. Water bottles are conspicuously
absent in both regions. The triangular ladle (V-1290)
in the pre-Caddo collection may be a highly
conventionalized shell form.
Flat and rounded rims are typical of each ceramic
group. The former type, in Florida as well as in
Louisiana and Arkansas, frequently has the typical
incised line in the edge of the rim. Carelessness in
only partially obliterating on the interior the coil of

33

clay forming a vessel rim is apparent in both preCaddo and northwestern Florida vessels.
Effigy forms and vessels profusely perforated
for ceremonial purposes from the northwestern
coast of Florida have no exact counter parts in preCaddo pottery. It is worthy of note, however, that
these forms occur principally in the above
mentioned area, and are not found in the central
coastal region of the peninsular state.12 This might
indicate a purely local specialization of a widespread
culture. If, as Mr. Lemley suggests, the intentional
scarification of pre-Caddo vessels is a type of
ceremonial “killing,” we have a kindred practice
among people with the same animistic belief, but a
more refined symbolism. In a mound on Saline
Point, Louisiana, Moore found a pot, somewhat
resembling several from the Crenshaw site, whose
bottom had been perforated prior to firing.13
Similarity in the decoration of West Floridan and
pre-Caddoan ware is noteworthy. The execution
of the patterns is surprisingly similar. In both regions
the designs have been incised. Raised, vertical bands
at the corners of quadrilateral vessels are found in
each complex. Some four-sided pots of the preCaddo culture have a different design on each wall.
The same feature has been noted in Florida.14 Only
two sides of a quadrilateral vessel (V-1145) from
the Crenshaw site have incised designs. Moore
observed the same feature on Vessel No. 35 from
the larger mound near Burnt Mill Creek,
Washington County, Florida.15 The chief incised
decoration of pots and bowls from the western coast
of Florida occurs within a horizontal band, outlined
by lines. We have already referred to this same
decorative feature of the pre-Caddo ware. Two
perforations beneath the rim are also common in
Florida pottery.
The scroll and undulating band with a
background of punctations, or diagonally incised
lines, which is so typical of pottery from the
Crenshaw site, was also a favorite decorative
combination of pottery along the western coast of
Florida. Another distinctive feature pointing toward
some relationship between pre-Caddo and western
Florida pottery is the line which frequently bisects
longitudinally the scroll and undulating motifs. This

34

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

line sometimes terminates in a triangular or circular
punctation. The latter type of punctation is often
placed more or less equidistantly along the median
line of a motif. Straight and curved lines terminating
in punctations are not only found on pre-Caddo

and western Florida wares, but also on pottery from
Marksville, Louisiana, and the West Indies. Mr. A.
T. Jackson of the University of Texas has informed
the writer that he has seen straight lines ending in
dots in the petroglyphs of Texas.
Moore found this motif on bird
effigy vessels from the
northwestern Florida coast so often
that he concluded that it was a bird
symbol. He says, “Symbols of this
class are found on practically all
bird-vessels, and consist of straight
or curved lines with circular or
triangular enlargement at one or
both ends. These bird symbols are
sometimes found on vessels
apparently having no connection
with bird forms, though they may
indicate some connection with the
bird.16 The occurrence of a bird
symbol when considered with other
features of pottery of the west
coast of Florida and the pre-Caddo
ware suggests some relationship to
the Marksville complex.

Certain general culture traits,
such as bowl and pot forms,
polished scroll and undulating band
motifs against a roughened
background, paste, and temper,
which are common to both
Marksville and pre-Caddo
complexes, would lead one to

The discovery of the pre-Caddo
culture at the Crenshaw Place is the
most important step so far made in
the study of Arkansas archaeology. It
affords the student of Arkansas
aboriginal antiquities material for the
study of various aspects of a purely
prehistoric culture antedating the
Caddo. A tentative chronology, which
may be elaborated later, can now be
established. A detailed study of
pottery, stone work, architecture and
burial customs may later establish a
definite connection between the
aborigines of Flordia, Louisiana, and
the pre-Caddo. As the pre-Caddo
pottery complex had ramifications
eastward in Arkansas one would
naturally expect it to also extend
westward into Texas, and possibly
into Oklahoma.

KITCHEN MIDDENS OF THE UPPER RED RIVER DRAINAGE
BY ADOLPH HENRY WITTE
Innumerable traces of stone age men are to be
found in this section of the upper Red river drainage.
Commonly, the evidence is not plentiful and consists
only of stone artifacts. Usually, there is little or no
thickness to the soil stratum that contains the manmade debris. The artifacts found are of local and
imported materials, and certain technical criteria
serve to identify some as of Folsom, and others as
of Clear Fork culture types. (Note 1). Other
paleolithic types have not been classified, and the
early human horizons from which they came, are
up to the present date, unrecognized. Several
stratified sites, somewhat deeply buried, have been
found. The overburden of sterile soil is quite thick
and the expense of properly excavating the areas
will be large. It is the sincere hope of the writer
that these deep sites will be carefully investigated
in the near future by qualified individuals.
Kitchen Middens
During 1935 several similar kitchen midden sites
were discovered. Measurements indicated a
thickness of 48” or more in certain spots, and each
midden was found to extend over a number of acres.
Numerous flint rejects, bones, potsherds, perfect
and broken tools, etc., were visible in the eroded
slopes. Apparently each deposit contains thousands
of bones and artifacts.

of similar cultural traits. Almost identical bone tools,
chipped and polished artifacts, potsherds, etc., were
found in each midden.
The sites described are situated near the largest
streams within this area where a supply of water
was always available. In addition, a large permanent
spring is closely adjacent to the Ht. site. No evidence
was found during the excavations that would
indicate that the areas were ever submerged during
the period of occupancy.
Our excavations showed that the campelevations were capped by a sandy soil stratum,
human and aeolian in origin. The second stratum
which is barren of bones or human evidences, is a
compact red clay which probably has lain
undisturbed since originally deposited during
Permian ages. The author is not competent to
classify the upper or human stratum as to geological
age. The following conclusions are offered,
however. During the geological history of these old
river valleys, a period of time was reached in which
erosion ceased on the clay elevations, and a period
of upbuilding was begun by wind action. It appears
that the Indians arrived and occupied the sites soon
after this original upbuilding process started,
because many bones and artifacts are found in situ,
in close proximity to the second, or sterile clay
stratum.

In this level, the soil is invariably damp after rains

locate definite burials was one of the major
disappointments of the investigation. The discovery
of broken and fragmentary human bones, mixed
with other camp rubbish may indicate cannibalism.
Archeological evidences of cannibalism have been
reported by others in Texas and adjacent states

In conducting the excavations, the
soil was removed in 6” levels, and
nearly all of the excavated material
was screened. This was a laborious
task but we were amply repaid, for
many small objects that would not
have been noticed were discovered on
the screen.
Nothing was found in the sites that
would indicate European contact. A
check of the bones collected, showed
none identifiable as belonging to the
horse. Occasionally, some bones
displayed a most interesting feature.

seen, and these are ordinarily parallel.

bones by the writer include the
following: dog, bison, deer, rabbit, rat,
duck, turkey, flicker, beaver, coyote,
antelope, etc. Fish bones, belonging
to several different species, and also
several species of freshwater mussels
were noticed. A few human bones
were found mixed with broken animal
and other camp trash. Nothing was
observed that could be considered a
burial. Fragmentary parts of human
crania were found on the eroded

hunters, commonly did not fetch the bison skull into
camp.
Gaming Bone
Two small local areas were found where grains
of corn, embedded in the usual camp deposit could
be distinguished. The maize was free from the cob
and carbonized. The grains are small, compared to
modern corn and might be described as “short” and
“plump”. The salient features of these grains were
no doubt somewhat different before contact with
fire. It is to be regretted that more of this interesting
cereal could not be discovered, especially specimens
of complete ears. In both instances, the corn was
located near the bottom of the midden deposit.
Bone Tools
A surprisingly large number of bone artifacts
were well preserved in the deposits. Awls rank first
in number. One group of these were shaped from
mammal leg bones. This group can be divided into
four classes:
Awl with entire head of bone left intact.
Awl with head of bone unaltered except original
splitting.
Awl with head of bone partly worked down.
Splinter awl. No modification of original splinter
beyond sharpening tip.
A second group of awls were fashioned from
mammal ribs. These show several classes, splinter
and worked types, as well as minute forms.
Awls of various sorts were found in all levels.
Occasionally, specimens have been fire tempered.
Flakers
A few blunt punches of antler tines and of thick
mammal leg bones very likely should be classified
as flakers. Broken fragments of thick deer antler,
with polished surfaces, have not been classified.

A small bone artifact was found in a shallow
deposit, near the edge of midden B. It is likely that
the tool was made from a deer phalange. W. D.
Strong has described and illustrated a similar bone
artifact from Nebraska deposits. According to
Strong’s classification, the artifact is a cup for the
“rin-and-pin”, game of the prehistoric Indians.
(Note 4).
Bison Scapula Tools
Two complete bison scapulae were found in the
pits. A careful examination disclosed no evidences
of use as tools. However, at various levels, a number
of tools fashioned from different parts of bison
scapulae were discovered. These tools were usually,
in a poor condition, due to rough usage. The
consensus of opinion is that these were used as
digging implements—the cutting edges are often
fractured and dull. No notches, nor other evidence
that would serve as proof of halting has been
observed. The basal ends of the tools are well
rounded and polished—further evidence that the
artifacts probably were used as hand tools.
Bison Skull Tools
An ingenious ladle or tool was made from a part
of the bison skull and horn core. The horn core and
a few inches of the attached concave bone tissue of
the forehead were utilized. When complete, the
edge of the bone tissue was sharpened, and half of
the horn cone was left which formed a convenient
handle. Evidently these tools received long hard
usage as the beveled edges were chipped and dull,
similar to the scapulae digging implements.
Specimens were found in situ in the pits, buried
from 18” to 4-2” in depth. The majority of all found
were in the lower parts of the deposits. A number
of fragments of these skull tools were found on the
eroded surfaces of the St. and H. midden and

Nothing is known as to the distribution of the bison

them elsewhere (except Strong, Note 5) the
distribution is presumed to be limited. Average
length, 8”, or 200 mm.
Bison Metatarsus End-Scrapers or Fleshers
These were found in the middle and the bottom
levels, and range from four to eight inches in length
(95 mm. to 185 mm.) In fashioning these tools, the
entire sponge-like bone tissue was removed from
the marrow cavity. In addition, the cavity was
extended entirely through the articular end of all
the specimens that we found. The reason why the
handles of these fleshers were completely tunnelled
“out” has not been determined, unless the
classification is accepted that was given a somewhat
similar tool, illustrated in plate 78, Explorations and
Field-Work of the Smithsonian Institution in 1932.
The tool is described as a combination flesher and
knife handle. (W. D. Strong).

expanding, but there are aberrant types. Whether
these types with tangs and barbs denote intermittent
occupations of the middens by peoples from other
cultural centers, remains to be determined.
The excavations proved that all of the above
discussed types were in use throughout the entire
history of the middens. The only noticeable feature
was that small points from the lower levels were
usually somewhat cruder than those gathered from
the upper parts of the deposits.

Small triangular points with side notches and
straight, concave, or notched bases have been found
over a vast part of the present United States. This
was the predominant type at the Pecos Pueblo,
(Note 6). “Tens of thousands of this type came from
the Great Cahokia Mound Group in Illinois,” and
are known locally as “Cahokia Points”. (Note 7).
This type, notched and without notches came from
the upper level at Signal Butte. (Note 8). In Texas,
Dr. Cyrus N. Ray, reports this type from Abilene.
(Note 9), Mr. Floyd V. Studer reports this type in
the Texas Panhandle house ruins. (Note 10). Mr.

polishers that are square or rectangular in cross
section often have one or more grooves or incised
marks on each face. In some tools the depth of the
channel or groove is variable, the result of grinding
and working short objects, perhaps bone beads. The
largest and most carefully made shaft grinder that
we found came from the top level in a test pit. The
unshaped and crudest specimens commonly came
from the lowest levels. Measurements of the
grooves that are semicircular in cross section vary,
occasionally diameters are as large as ½”. The
average is approximately 3/8” in width. It might be
mentioned here that measurements of shaft grinders
from the ruined Pecos pueblo in New Mexico,
showed that the Pecos archers preferred 3/8” shafts
or foreshafts for their arrows. (Note 16).
The mano stones found in the tests were the
usual oval-shaped type, and came from all depths.
No entire metates were found. Judging from the
fragments discovered in the deposits, those with a
rather deep basin were preferred.
Knives
Few knives and large projectiles were found in
the excavations. One four-edged bevelled knife was
found. It is of Texas Panhandle flint and was
screened from the top six-inch level. Cumulative
evidence places this knife in use up to a late period.
(Note 17). A fragment of a large knife was found in
situ, 18” from the surface in the Bk. Site. It was
slightly notched on each edge and exhibited no
“bevelled technique.” The material is local, a
quartzite. The writer has picked up from the surface
of each of the midden deposits under discussion
flake knives, four-edged bevelled knives, leafshaped knives, and triangular knives. The last
pattern has a straight, sharp base, in fact three
cutting edges. The four-edged bevelled knives
found on the surface are either of Texas Panhandle
flint, Central Texas flint (various color phases), and
local quartzite. The flake knives were also of the
above mentioned materials. The leaf-shaped knives
are of Central Texas and local “flint”, but none of
Panhandle flint. The triangular knives were also of
local, and Central Texas materials. This is perhaps

41

the most uncommon type. The large projectile
points found in the excavations are so few in number
as to make any sort of classification of little value.
Unless further tests prove to the contrary it would
seem that spears or atlatls were not used. Additional
evidence, from the writer’s surface collection from
the St. midden substantiates the above statement.
Out of a total of 200 projectile points, gathered on
the surface of this midden, only 6 large projectiles
were found. Five of these large points were found
in a small eroded area, and at a somewhat lower
level than the midden deposit. It appears that the
large points are in a strata below the midden, and
erosion has exposed this earlier level, only in this
one spot.
Local Quartzite
This material varies in color and granular
appearance. It is obvious that it is exceptionally
difficult to “work” but tools were found in all levels,
chipped from this local stone. The finished artifacts
are usually somewhat thick.
Numerous outcrops of quartzite occur in the
south part of this county (Clay) and in the adjacent
county east (Montague).
A number of four-edged knives of this material
were found in the I cultivated surface of the St.
midden. In using local quartzite for points, scrapers,
knives and awls, the Indians who left the midden
deposits merely followed the same routine
established by paleolithic men, who discovered and
used this material unmeasured centuries ago. A
“grooved” Folsom spear of this local “flint” came
from the surface of a high river terrace near Ryan,
Oklahoma. Specimens of blades and axes, with
sinuous edges, deep patina, and of antique
appearance, are often of this local “flint.” That these
belong to early horizons, cannot be questioned.
Texas Panhandle Flint
Artifacts of this material are not found in large
numbers within this area. However, tools made of
this chert were discovered in all levels of the
deposits. It is true also that sites without pottery
usually yield Panhandle flint specimens. Apparently,
this region is near the eastern edge of this material

flint at the ruined Pecos Pueblo, New Mexico.
During a brief investigation in the Galisteo
valley (farther to the west), the writer found
several snub-nosed scrapers and part of a fouredged knife, all fashioned from this beautiful
“flint”.
Earth Covered Lodges
The digging exposed chunks of burned clay
wattle in various levels. Impressions of grasses
and small twigs are discernible. This burned
clay was roofing material and is unquestionable
proof of earth covered dwellings of some sort.
Later, in several of the test pits we uncovered
what appeared to be definite floor levels.
Several fire-pits, and small storage cists were
found below the floor levels. The mouth of
one cist was covered by a stone slab. The
contents of the cists were screened out, but
nothing was found except the average camp
rubbish.
Pipes
An unfinished elbow pipe of local sandstone
came from the surface of the St. midden. It is
obvious that this object was pecked to shape
as each end is deeply pitted. The small end
cavities show a most interesting preparatory
technique, for of course this served to guide
the bit of the drilling apparatus when the
drilling started.

excavations are listed as follows: Fragment of

Pot Sherds
Pot sherds were found on the surface and in all

fairly large mouthed with funnel-shaped, or straight
cylindrical necks. Sherds were found mixed in the
same levels, belonging to each neck type. The
bodies were globular, and there are round and flat
bottomed types. It would appear that the flat
bottomed type of vessel was in somewhat late use
only. Sherds that could be identified as belonging
to this type were all found in the upper levels of the
excavations. The largest number of sherds came

Additional Artifacts
Other articles found in the camp-middens include
small snub-nosed scrapers (two, notched
specimens), awls of flint, bone beads (tubular),
entire and fragmentary, polished celts, and a number
of worked and polished bone and stone objects that
have not been classified.
It would appear that polished stone celts were
in use within this region, prior to the introduction
of pottery. Three polished celts in the writer’s file
came from non-pottery sites.
Future excavations probably will disclose data
unsuspected at this date. The author wishes to
emphasize the fact that only a small area in each
site has been excavated.

INTERESTING ARTIFACTS OF CLAY COUNTY, TEXAS
LEONARD D. BENNETT
While putting down a test to determine the depth
of the deposit in a local Indian campsite the writer
had the good fortune to strike a pocket at a depth
of 22 inches from the surface, which contained
several well preserved bone implements of unusual
form. Some of these were different from any that
he has seen described in archeological publications.
The campsite in which these artifacts were found
is located on a low sand dune situated barely above
the high-water line, on the north bank of the Little
Wichita River, one mile northwest from Henrietta,
Clay County, Texas. The deposit, at the point where
the test was made, proved to be 48 inches in depth,
and consisted of charcoal and ash impregnated sand,
underlain by a deposit of sterile undisturbed red
clay. Throughout the deposit of sand were numbers
of broken and unbroken fresh water mussel shells,
broken and burned bones of various animals, and
many pieces of broken and burned sandstone.
Although all of the material excavated was carefully
examined and screened, and an extensive search
was made over the entire area of the campsite which
resulted in the finding of over a hundred points,
scrapers, and knives, nothing was found that would
show that the occupants of this campsite were in
contact with white people.
The implements which the writer considers of
unusual form were fashioned from parts of the skulls
and the bony structure inside the horns of bisons.
In making these artifacts, the outer horn was
removed, the bony structure of the inner horn was
split from tip to base, and a part of the skull was
left adhering to the upper half of the split horn. The
bony part of the horn was then ground to a flat
surface on the split side, thus forming the handle of
the tool The inner side of the part of the skull left
attached to the horn base was smoothed and
polished, being decidedly cupped when completed,
and resembling a large spoon or ladle. The outside,
or convex side, of the skull portion was polished,
and the edges ground and polished to give the shape
best suited to the purpose for which the tool was
intended.

The variation in the shape of the implements
show that they were made for various purposes.
Some are shaped as if they were intended to be
used as ladles or spoons, being very definitely
cupped and having the edges blunted and rounded
as illustrated in figure (1) of plate 14, while others
are shaped and sharpened in such manner that there
is no doubt that they were intended to be used as
knives. Figure (2) of plate 14 illustrates this type.
The cutting edge ii very sharp and would be an
effective tool in skinning, fleshing, or dismembering.
From the shapes of other specimens noted by the
writer, scrapers, fleshers, knives, and digging tools
were made in the same manner. Strong’s
Introduction to Nebraska Archeology mentions a
fragment of an implement made from a part of the
skull of a bison, but his description is not definite
enough to chow whether or not it is an example of
this type of tool.
Another type of bone implement, pictured in
plate 14, No. 3, found with the above described
tools, was a hoe or digging tool made from a section
taken from the scapula of a bison. Several tools of
this type were found, and although no two of them
are exactly alike, the one pictured in plate 14 is
fairly representative in size and general contour.
The average length is about 7 inches, No doubt the
variation in shape and size was due to the inaccurate
method used in roughly shaping the implement and
to the irregular wearing away of the bone while the
tool was in use. The flaring or barb-like end of this
implement has been ground to a blunt point, and
the thinner bone, forming the barb shaped side, has
been ground to a sharp cutting edge and is highly
polished from use. On examining the specimens of
this type, the writer came to the conclusion that
some of them had been hafted, since they have a
roughly shaped handle or base but none of the rough
edges of it have been smoothed or polished as one
would expect them to be had they been used in the
hand very much. One of the specimens shows faint
striations as if it had not been very securely bound
to a handle. Others were evidently hand tools, as

46

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

the rough edges of the handle portions, or bases,
have been rounded off and show well defined polish,
with no notches or striations that would give
evidence of the attachment of handles. The theory
that this type of tool was used as a hoe might be
supported by the fact that flint hoes are not usually
found in this section. The writer knows of only one
that has been found in this region. William Duncan
Strong described several scapula tools similar to
the one described here, in the Smithsonian
publication, An Introduction to Nebraska
Archeology, though from his descriptions and
illustrations there are several marked differences in
the artifacts.

Other objects coming from the same test include

bones of birds or small animals; one bone disc onehalf inch in diameter and one-sixteenth of an inch

one spatula shaped tool made from the ulna of some
small animal, possibly wolf or fox; several sections
of broken mano stones of quartzite and sandstone;
one broken, flat type, metate; several small notched

fragments of ribs, and three made from heavy undecorated pottery tempered with sand and fine
unidentified bone slivers,
were found in the same test
at depths ranging from six
inches to 36 inches from
the surface. All of the awls
are very well preserved
and exhibit careful
workmanship on the part
of the maker. They vary in
length from three inches to
eight and a half inches. The

All of the artifacts and objects described in this
paper to this point came from an excavation four
feet wide by ten feet long that varied in depth,
according to the depth of the deposit, from 14 to
48 inches.
In another small test in the same campsite, 18
inches from the surface, the writer made an
interesting discovery in the form of a poorly fired
object of red clay representing a human figure,
(Plate 14, No. 4). The object represents a sitting or
kneeling figure which measures two and one-half
by two by five-eighths inches. The arms are at the
sides and are set off from the body by finely incised
lines. The stomach is represented, as are the legs,
by knobs or rounded projections five-sixteenths of
an inch high and near a half-inch in diameter at their
base. The area around these projections is incised
with fine lines forming a sort of cross hatching
where they cross one another. Unfortunately, the
area representing the nose and upper lip had been
broken off when the object was found, and as the
break was an old one, it was probably the cause of
the object having been discarded. The eyes are
represented by rectangular incisions one-eighth inch
long by one sixteenth of an inch wide, and show by
their form that they were punched into the soft clay
with a sharp rectangular sectioned awl or incising
tool. The forehead is represented by two parallel
lines incised one-eighth of an inch apart with two
rows of incised dots filling the space between them.
On the portion of the effigy that would be
considered the throat, there is a rectangular incision
similar in size and shape to those that represent the
eyes. From its appearance, it suggests that some
sort of an ornament might have been attached to
the effigy. A part of the base seems to have been
broken off, indicating that it might have been
attached to a vessel as an ornament, though the
lack of having been completely fired and the
difference in the material from which it is made from

47

that of the known types of pottery in this section,
tend to discredit this theory.
The writer sent this object to Mr. A. T. Jackson,
field foreman of Texas Archeology, for inspection,
and takes the liberty of quoting the following from
his letter concerning it:
“The clay object is very unusual. After
examining it, I discarded the potterysmoother idea. It is very suggestive of a
human effigy and may have been from the
rim of a vessel. I have before me the head
of a small animal effigy from a campsite
on Red River near Kiomatia, Red River
County. The clay is almost identical with
that in your specimen and is no better
worked, although I am inclined to think
that both specimens have been but poorly
fired. There is a possibility, of course, that
your specimen may not have been attached
to the rim of a vessel, as the break would
seem to indicate. At any rate, it is the first
of its kind that I have seen in Texas.”
The campsite from which the artifacts described
in this paper came, offers great possibilities for
archeological research into the history of the culture
which occupied it. The entire site covers
approximately thirty acres, but there remains only
about two acres of the sand dune which have not
been put into cultivation. As this portion lies nearest
the bank of the river, it should prove to be the richest
portion in cultural material. Further research should
be made in the immediate future, for it will be a
matter of a short time before much of the site will
be turned up by curio hunters.
The writer, working in conjunction with Mr. A.
H. Witte of Henrietta, has made an effort to preserve
all data possible in connection with all artifacts that
have been removed from this deposit, and will gladly
co-operate with any movement toward a more
complete study of the site. He has refrained from
advancing any theories as to the cultural types
represented in the material taken from this site, for
to do so, on the limited amount of material at hand,
would hardly be advisable.

THE POTTERY HORIZONS OF TEXAS
BY VICTOR J. SMITH
A few years ago Texas was thought of as having
pottery of scant amount and small importance. In
comparison with the vastly richer ceramic areas to
the east and west this was partially true. During
the past decade, however, many published reports
in the field of archeology have focused attention
upon the fact that the variety, distribution, and
importance of the ceramic field in Texas is deserving
of far more attention than has previously been
accorded to it. The general idea that Texas was not
important in this respect may also have resulted
from the fact that a great north and south bison
strip extended down through central Texas, nearly
to the coast, and this vast territory is generally
considered to be a non-ceramic area.

many directions: Southwestern, Southeastern,
plains, and even upper Mississippi Valley influences.
All of these carried certain environmental patterns
which may be observed in the design units of the
group, including pottery decorations from the
several parts of the State.

Thus it is quite natural that there should be
a drift of the typical designs of the Rio Grande and
other Pueblo groups into Texas in the neighborhood
of El Paso and to the South and East of that place.
Along with other distinguishing material culture
traits the use of pottery decorated in color is one of
the most important culture differentiations. The

part of the area, and on the periphery of Pueblo

undecorated brown ware occurs as heavy, sand
tempered, and brick-colored pottery. The brown
ware in decorated form is found as polychrome and
infrequently as black-on-brown. Red and black on
brown form geometric decorations as line designs,
stepped elements, rim decorations, etc. The red
wares do not extend north in a fashion
corresponding to the black-on-white but rather
spread south into Old Mexico.

To the north and East of the El Paso area lies
The design elements of the black-on-white wares
includes dots, striping, checkers, triangles,
diamonds, massed design elements, and other line
decorations of geometric patterns.
The pottery of the El Paso district consists chiefly
of flat-bottomed bowls of assorted sizes, ollas with
handles, and smaller varied forms. To the east of El
Paso and down the river valley the decorated wares
decrease in extent of distribution. In the
neighborhood of Lobo, Texas, I have found a plain
red ware which Dr. Mera has identified as similar
to materials found in Southeastern New Mexico
and associated with Chupadero and the El Paso
brown ware iron which it is distinct.
Stallings (19) has suggested the name of “El Paso
Decorated’ Brown” as a name for the native brown
wares. I understand that this has been shortened to
El Paso Polychrome in more recent reports. Within
the district this brown ware is also found
undecorated and I am inclined to think that the

another ceramic field although it is less marked with
this important culture trait. This is the Panhandle
Area of Texas, where pottery is found with
examples of the art of masonry, and the consequent
improved opportunities for stratigraphic studies.
The pottery found with these one-story rock
buildings is represented by numerous sherds
indicating extensive use of ceramics by the former
occupants of the ruins. Studer (13), after extensive
research, stated that the pottery represented is,
“nearly all fairly wide-mouthed, cylindrical necked,
round bottomed, globular bodied vessels made for
culinary use.” He further concluded that there is
no change between earlier and later types and that
there were no ceremonial developments in the
Panhandle pottery. Sherds of these utensils are
found of different thickness; black, red, and gray,
in various hues, constitute the predominating colors,
and the exterior treatment is without design save
for incised textile “basket or cord” impressions
which give the exterior of the vessel an appearance
comparable with the corrugated ware which I have
mentioned from the El Paso district. Tubular pipes

one inch, while the inside diameter of the stems is
one-half inch. Line decorations form the principal
applied designs and the pipes generally are
comparable with those of Arkansas to the east, as
are also many elements in the pottery complex.
Students interested in the ceramics of the East Texas

If the ceramic areas of Texas were listed
according to quality of workmanship, design,
and variety of forms, neither the Southwestern
types in Texas nor the Panhandle pottery
would rank so high as that of East Texas. It is
in this district that Prof. J. E. Pearce (10 and
16), University of Texas, and his associates
have done extensive research. The Caddoan
peoples of the Northeast section of Texas
were a definite part of the Southeastern Area
(Mississippi Valley) groups, although their
shelters were somewhat different from the
true Mississippi type, and other material
culture traits blend somewhat with those of
the Plains culture to the west. Here again the
agricultural activities of the group closely
paralleled the ceramic arts, and pottery
became a distinctive culture trait.
Students will find that Jackson (6) has
summarized this portion of the East Texas
pottery complex in a most helpful manner and
has tabulated the ceramic articles in order of
frequency as: bowls, pots, bottles, jars, and
pipes, together with the burial customs related
thereto. Many unusual types of pottery lend
distinction lo the East Texas field: tripartite
bottles, well formed ollas, varieties of bowls,
jars in different forms, pedestal types,
suspension utensils, ladles, etc. The
decoration of these many forms is often found
in the shape of the article itself such as body
shape, ornamental handles, projecting nodes,
modelled ribs, pedestals, some variation in
color and finish, and rim treatment. Applied
designs occur as incised circles, scrolls,
triangular and other geometric elements.
Among the clay pipes most frequently
reported from the East Texas area are the
conical bowl, elbow, and stemmed types. The

field should visit the exhibits assembled at the
University of Texas at Austin, or read the articles
referred to at the close of this paper. It is to be
hoped that the University will publish additional
specialized reports which are confined to specific,
areas or to particular problems.
Along the curving Gulf coast of Texas is a long
and narrow ceramic field, which is almost
continuous and which widens out considerably as
Louisiana is neared. This strip, however, is
comprised of several rather distinct ceramic areas,
as certain criteria indicate East Coast, Central, and
Brownsville areas, with possible sub-divisions
which cannot be clearly distinguished until more
extensive research has been done in this field. South
of the Northeastern woodland, or Red River Caddo
group, are found pottery evidences left by the
members of the Hasinai Confederacy. Mr. A. T.
Jackson has called attention to the fact that there
are marked differences m shape as well as in
decoration in these two groups. In the south the
predominant East Texas influences gradually shade
off until the Gulf is reached. Agriculture had
disappeared, as sea foods became more important,
although the Attacapan are generally considered to
be agricultural peoples. Potsherds are found
abundantly throughout the territory from Galveston
Bay on to the north and east. The mortuary custom
of pottery burial with the dead is recorded for lower
East Texas but nearly all of the picture of the
ceramics of these peoples has been reconstructed
from sherd evidence. In places the long action of
natural forces such as flood, wind, tide, and waves,
have built up huge shell reefs containing water worn
sherds in homogenous but scant distribution. Some
incised line work indicates a knowledge of applied
design but the bulk of the lower East Texas pottery
is undecorated, although well formed and generally
of excellent quality.
As one travels down the coast from Matagorda
County to Kleberg County, the sherd evidence is
found in less quantity and in cruder form. This is
Karankawan territory. The crudeness of the pottery
is entirely in harmony with the evidence available
concerning these people, who are known to have
practiced cannibalism, and to have been of

51

comparatively low culture. Potter (11) has
recognized three classes of ware in this section of
the coastal area; heavy cooking ware, lighter
cooking utensils, and an abundant representation
of water vessels which are more extensively
decorated than the first two types. This decoration
is in the form of simple line work. Asphalt was used
both for water-proofing and as a part of the design
elements. Interior designs are seldom found. A few
intrusions from the Mississippi valley are recorded.
Handles are rare but provisions for cord or fiber
lifting devices have been noted. Most of the utensils
of the central coast are round bottomed.
From Kleberg County south, sherds are less
abundant. The territory is, nevertheless, of
archeological importance and studies of the
ceramics of the district should be continued. This
South Coast or Brownsville district, is now
attracting attention because of the possibility of
Huaxtec types. Painted figures on unslipped buff
and brown wares are typical of the southern tip of
Texas. Conflicting reports concerning the use of
pottery by the Coahuiltecan groups suggest again
the desirability of further research in the South
Texas field. I have personally been keenly interested
in the scholarly discussion by Dr. J. A. Mason (9)
in which he recognized Huaxtec influences in the
pottery finds of the Brownsville area and also so
far north as 150 miles. Between the Brownsville
district and the pure Karankawan area on the north,
he recognized a strip of coast in which there may
have been a dual occupation, and has suggested
that the Coahuiltecan peoples may have been
responsible for the traces of Huaxtec influence in
this area.
I have, to this point, indicated several rather
distinct ceramic areas of Texas. I know of no part
of Texas, however, where occasional intrusions
have not been located, usually as shallow or surface
specimens. But the whole of the older Trans-Pecos
region is without pottery; and a huge wedge of
territory extending through central Texas from the
north, and almost to the coast is likewise nonceramic in its material culture traits. The two
districts differ, however, in that the Big Bend cave
dwellers were agricultural while the central Texas

52

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

Indians were nomadic hunters. It should be said
that the older cave dwellers of West Texas lived in
nearly all of the territory which I have previously
described as being occupied by Pueblo pottery
peoples.
It is also true that all of the distinct pottery areas
described herein influence to a more or less degree
the neighboring areas, sometimes more for one
culture trait than another. Pottery extensions, for
example, follow up the river valleys beyond the
limits of the East Texas pottery district, and
Panhandle artifacts of ceramic manufacture extend
eastward and in other directions to some extent.
The Abilene neighborhood represents one of two
marginal areas which I should like to mention. Dr.
Cyrus N. Ray reported by letter that pottery sites
are scattered throughout an area centering in
Abilene and that more sherds are found south and
southwest of Abilene than north, but that a thin
distribution is found as far as 75 miles north and
northeast. I have generally thought of the Texas
and Pacific Railroad as a rough boundary between
the thinly scattered and mixed pottery sites which
appear to the north and west of this line and which
diminish to zero to the south and east of the same
boundary. In Bulletin 7 of the Texas Archeological
and Paleontological Society Dr. Ray has pointed
out the types and relationships of the Abilene sherds.
This article, supplemented by Dr. J. B. Griffin’s
analyses in the same publication, will make further
comment here unnecessary save to point out the
fact that the incised line decorations suggest East
Texas influences and the sites with striated
decorations may have had their origin in the
Panhandle. It may be well here to suggest the further
study of corrugated ware in Texas since there is
such a high percentage in the western part of the
state about El Paso and also to the northeast.

are suggested. Here again ceramics overlay the old
cave culture of the Big Bend to some degree but
the sherd evidence does not extend far from the
river valley.
I have suggested that the continuation of detailed
studies related to ceramics is an important phase of
Texas archeology. Many problems of migration,
diffusion, and chronology, will be partly solved
when exact and extensive reports of this data are
published. Possibly a general clearing house, such
as the University of Texas should be the center of
such records with the Laboratory of Anthropology,
the Ceramic Repository, and other cooperating
agencies contributing to the progress of the work.
An example of the importance of further studies
lies in the problems surrounding the pre-Columbian
relationship of Old Mexico to the United States.
Texas studies should assist materially in determining
the origins of pottery in the United States. The
three-legged types of pottery found by the
University of Texas are strong reminders of Mexican
and Central American types of similar form. With
respect to the present evidence bearing upon this
important problem I am inclined to agree with the
conclusions of Mason (9) that the Texas coast
provides a far more likely link than either the CubaFlorida hurdle or the Pueblo-Panhandle route of
diffusion. Present evidence against the Gulf coast
route, however, seems to preclude any safe
conclusion save of a larger migratory wave of
peoples to the North-East without a prolonged stay
at any one point on the gulf. Such a migration may
have occurred before the highest developments in
the Mayan cultures. It seems important further to
point again to the possibility of connecting more
definitely than is now possible to some of the
relationships between the Caddo of the Red River
and the Jumano of the Big Bend and Northern
Mexico.

Another area which is now being given careful

The Coahuiltecan tribes first made their appearance
on the coast after escaping from the San Juan
Mission in 1754. None were previously mentioned
as on the coast until that year. They spread north
and easterly along the coast from the north bank of
the Nueces and its bays. It was at this time that the
pottery was laid down on the sites from Corpus
Christi Bay to Matagorda. * * * Other tribes joined
the Karankawas after this time. Some of these were
pottery makers.

7-8. Southern Coast. A. E. Anderson: In a
general way, as you go north along the coast for 50
miles from the Rio Grande sherds become more
scarce and the quality of the ware becomes more
inferior. As you go south for a similar distance the
situation is reversed, more pottery is found and, as
a rule, of better quality. Some of the best
“Huastecan” ware however, is found to the north
and the inferior ware is plentiful to the south. The
crudest of this inferior pottery seems to have been
the small bowls and cooking pots,
sometimes decorated with a black
asphalt band around the rim and
vertical zigzag lines from the rim
downward. This resembles very much
the pottery found near Rockport and
has been described by Potter in the
No. 3 Bulletin of the Society. This
ware, as a rule, is less than one-fourth
inch in thickness and is poorly fired,
the interior being black and the
exterior surface red, black, or brown.
The tempering material is usually
crushed shell. Apparently the base of
a typical vessel was round, not
concave as is characteristic of other
local wares.

I call the best high grade pottery
found locally “Huastecan”. Dr. Mason
does not definitely place it as
Huastecan, but he calls attention to
the fact that it resembles that ware in
several particulars. This ware may be
subdivided as follows: 1. Polychrome.
Scarce. Two specimens found south
of the Rio Grande. 4 ½ gal. ollas. 14”
diam. and 14” high. Small neck
opening indicates use only as water
vessels. Found in burials. 2. Dark
brown line decoration in curvilinear
design on cream colored ware. Both
sides of river. Large and small ollas.
Sometimes with eccentrically spaced
handles. 3. Black-brown solid painted
inside and outside except along
outside of rim which may be
decorated by painted designs. Bowls.

The Pottery Horizons of Texas
Found both sides of Rio Grande. 4. Unpainted
cream colored to reddish ware of uniform texture.
Scarce. South of river only. Bowls and other vessels
of odd shape decorated by horizontal grooves or
raised bands with circular depressed rings. 5. Red
slip solid. Found both sides of Rio Grande. One
restorable vessel was a large jar of five gallons
capacity. Probably used for cooking purposes.
Other types have not been studied but are present.
Tempering materials are crushed shell, sand, sand
and shell, crushed pottery, and a fiber of some type.
Broken vessels were often mended by thongs tied
through perforations opposed to each other across
the break. Some pottery was molded around the
outside of woven baskets and some sherds plainly
show the weave impressions. Pipes were also made
of clay. They measure from two to four inches long
with a top diameter from two to three inches,
tapering to about one inch at the bottom which was
perforated in alignment with the bowl. Some appear
to have been molded about a form of twigs or grass
which burned out and formed the bowl cavity. Small
round discs from ¼” to 2” in diameter were
manufactured from pottery sherds. I also have two
disc beads of pottery which were made from sherds.
Occasional rectangular * * * sherds were carefully
smoothed at the edges for some purpose. An
examination of camp debris has not yielded
satisfactory age comparison evidence. A study of
numerous other material culture evidences indicate
that the Rio Grande Delta has had only one basic
archeological culture. * * * Apparently here we
have many different kinds of pottery but no real
change of culture.
George A. Matin: The pottery of the Brownsville
area is Tamaulipecan (Huastecan). The Borrados
resided here, a Tamaulipecan tribe. The Maraquitas,
also Tamaulipecan, resided from the north boundary
of Borrado County to Corpus Christi Bay. With
them, in the same territory, was the Manos de Perro,
also Tamaulipecan. These three tribes have been
loosely classified as Coahuiltecan because the
Borrados and Manos de Perro are recorded on the
title page of Father Bartholomeo Garcia’s, “Manual
Para Administrar Los Santos Sacramentos de
Penitencia”, etc., as understanding the tongue in
which the “Manual” was written. Something which

55

all who have so classified have overlooked,
however, is the fact that Garcia also wrote—that
the language was understood only by the young
people of the Borrados and Manos de Perro (he
does not mention the Maraquitas in his list) (y toda
la juvuntud de Borrados, Pihuiques, Sanipaos y
Manos de Perro). This alone indicates that the
Borrados and Manos de Perro were not
Coahuiltecan. As the coastal Lipans made no
pottery until very late in their history, and as there
are but two distinct cultures between Corpus Christi
Bay and the Rio Grande on the coast, the pottery
now found there must be Tamaulipecan.
9. The Abilene District. Dr. Cyrus N. Ray:
Potsherds have been found in only 22 sites in the
Abilene region, and in some of these only a few
sherds have been found. The sites which contain
the most sherds are in Taylor County, on small
branches of the Colorado River, and on two small
branches of the Brazos River which rise in the same
region. In some pottery sites, on branches of both
rivers, flakes of New Mexican obsidian and two
obsidian artifacts have been found. In two of these
sites four Pueblo painted potsherds have been
found, two in each site. All of these sherds are of
Rio Grande Glaze paint. In one of these more
obsidian has been found than in any other site. This
is listed as Site (1) in Ray, The Pottery Complex
Artifacts of the Abilene Region, Vol. 7, 1935,
Bulletin of this Society, and it also contains pottery
with a plain red slip, which is different in color from
that in any of the other local sites. The pottery of
this region is usually colored either brown, gray,
tan or black. Much of the local pottery is plain,
undecorated and varies in thickness from an eighth
of an inch to nearly one-half inch. There are also
many sherds showing scratched or brushed surfaces,
encircling scored bands, finger nail marks, cross
hatches, and occasional chevrons. The tempering
material commonly used in sherds of the Abilene
region was of ground fossil bone or Collophanite.
(Matson, Identification of Aplastic Present in
Pottery Sherds From Texas, Vol. 7, 1935, Bulletin
of this Society). There is also one type which
contains no fossil bone, but in which sand has been
used as the tempering material.

flints found along the Red River.
The arrowheads usually are somewhat crude.
There are three flint quarries in the region that
were worked extensively by the Indians. One is
located on White Rock Creek about 3 miles east of
Dallas. Another one is about 2 miles east of Pleasant
Grove on Scyene Creek. The other is on Muddy
Creek, a tributary of East Fork. Most of the flint of
these three quarries is red quartz flint.

The small points, however, show a high degree of
workmanship.
The pottery sherds are like those usually found
in camps in this part of the State. The three common
classes of sherds are found. The pottery of this camp
shows very little shell mixed in it.

19, Figure 4, was found. It was used as either a
pendant or a digging tool.
Rockwall I.
This site covers about 3 acres and is located on
a sandy ridge extending to East Fork bottoms. It is
about 1/8 mile from the camp to the river. Since
there is a large amount of flint, shell, and bone
debris, the writer believes that this camp was
occupied over a long period of time.
Flint: The arrowheads are mostly heavy, coarse
points, with stemmed base and small barbs, and are
usually about 1 1/2 or 2 inches long. There are also
a few rectangular stemmed points. Some of the best
of these points are shown on Plate 18, Figures 9,
15, and 16.
Some of the small points are thin, slender, long
stemmed points with wide sharp barbs. Others are

thin, slender, short stemmed points, with wide
flaring barbs, and serrated edges. A few are thin,
wide, flaring stemmed square barbed points. Some
of these points are pictured on Plate 18, Figures
10, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28.
Flint drills are of two types. First is the flake
based drill with long slender point and base not
worked, and then the flaked drill with short stubby
point and base worked into a rounded edge. I, also,
have one drill from this camp which has a slender
point with the base worked into a long straight edge.
This drill could have been used for a scraper, also.
It is shown on Plate 18, Figure 5. Some of the other
drills from this camp are shown on Plate 18, Figures
3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
Scrapers are of three types. The first type is a
small, round snub nosed scraper, with the end
sometimes pointed. The second type is a slender
keelbacked scraper with the end worked into a sharp
point. The third type is a small scraper which has

This site covers about 2 ½ or 3 acres and is
located on a ridge near Rowlett Creek. It was not
occupied long, but the Indians left some well made
implements. One of the best of these is a small point
shown on Plate 19, Figure 34. It is 1 7/8 inches
long and 5/8 inch wide at the barb, and is made of
a very light tan flint. The small points shown on
Plate 19, Figures 31, 32 and 33, are also from this

are either triangular, or leaf shaped points.

Arrowheads with the exception of triangular and

at other camps along the river.

Camp Sites Along the Elm Fork
Camp sites along Elm Fork of the Trinity, usually
are located on small sandy hills; however, these
differ from those of the East Fork in that they are
more scattered. This condition is due to the fact
that most of the land along East Fork is black land,
while most of the land along Elm Fork is sandy.

Elm Fork of the Trinity seems to be the dividing
line between Caddo and western Indian cultures.

This site is situated on the east side of Elm Fork,
near the Lake Dallas dam. It is now impossible to
determine how much land this camp covered, due
to the fact that the lake now covers most of it;

A “PERPETUAL FIRE” SITE
BY A. T. JACKSON
The A. C. Saunders site is located near the
western edge of the East Texas “redlands.” It is
one-half mile west of the Neches River, three and
one-half east of Frankston, and 25 miles northeast
of Palestine, Anderson County. The region is
timbered with pine, oaks, gums and smaller trees.
Wild berries and fruits abound. There are numerous
small spring-fed streams emptying into the muddy
water of the Neches. A permanent spring is about
one-fourth mile from the site.
At this place are found an ash mound, a large
housesite—outlined by postholes—and a dense

work in the midden deposit was so productive and
representative of the culture complex of the area
as to make desirable the excavation of the entire
midden.
Thus, after a lapse of four years, the work was
resumed. From October 1 to 10, 1935, the midden
was completely excavated, a second trench dug into
the ash mound and additional work done in an effort
to locate the cemetery.

For the first twenty feet increasing numbers of
potsherds, animal bones and mussel shells were
uncovered. Intermixed with the midden materials
were numerous whole and fragmentary artifacts.

were not found at lower depths. Only one sherd
with white paint in the incisions was found. It came
from a depth of three inches. This scarcity of white
paint in prehistoric sites has been noted in various
cemeteries in the vicinity.2
The sherds show what appears to be shell and
sand tempering material. The question of whether
this is shell or other calcareous material has not
been definitely settled.
In addition to the ware common to the region,
there were a number of sherds of foreign or aberrant
types. These included corrugated and deeply ridged
ware, large nodular lines, and a rim bearing square
notches. The latter type of decoration may be merely
a variation of the more common form of saw-tooth
or triangular-notched edge. It, however, seems
worth noting that the square and rectangular
notched edges of certain sherds from Texas coastal
campsites3 bear a close resemblance in technique
to this one from Anderson County.

that no large vessels are found in graves of the
region. A question accordingly is raised as to
whether there was an Asinai taboo against placing
very large pots in their graves. (Among the Caddo
large pots are common in graves). The large handles
were evenly divided between the upper and middle,
but scarce in the lower, levels. The large knobs or
“lugs” were almost twice as plentiful in the middle
as in the other two levels combined. The
percentages of the large handles and knobs from
the various depths are as follows:

A type of bone implement peculiar to this region
came almost exclusively from depths of 10 to 14
inches. It is of the general class commonly called a
flaking implement, but is differentiated by a beveled,
screwdriver-like end. The edges appear to have been
ground fairly sharp and show little evidence of wear.
One is thus caused to wonder whether it was used
for flaking arrowpoints or for some other use—
perhaps as an incising tool for decorating pottery.
The flakers of the round-end type, on the other
hand, are much worn and bear scratches and cuts.
Of 58 bone flaking implements, 26 were from
the upper, 27 from the middle and five from the
bottom level. More than half of them were from
depths of 9 to 14 inches. This is surprising in view
of the facts stated above concerning the depths of
the arrowpoints.
Half of the used antler came from the upper level;
with the remaining half divided about equally
between the other levels.
Twenty bone awls came from the midden. Six
were from the upper, eight from the middle and six
from the lower level. The awls were comparatively
crude, with the sharp end fairly well worked but
the remainder, in most cases, left in a rough state.
Most of them are of deer, a few of fish bones. These
partly worked awls are in striking contrast to the
well worked artifacts found in rockshelters in West
Texas.
Shell artifacts were scarce. A few mussel shells
(Unio sp.) were ground down to’ form so-called
spoons. Two—from depths of 8 and 12 inches—
were perforated, either for use as rattles or for
hafting. One showed use as a digging implement.
The ornaments included a small conch shell
pendant, a conch shell bead, three beads of bird
bones and one which probably is of antler. All these
came from the upper 12 inches.
The pendants’ measurements were 1 1-8 in. by
3-8 in. by 1-8 in.; and it had two drilled holes 1-8
inch in diameter, separated by a space of 1-16 inch
and 1-8 inch from one end. The edges were roughly
smoothed and, except for the perforations, the
workmanship was poor. It came from a depth of
only one inch.

The conch shell bead, made from the columella
of the shell, was found at a depth of 11 inches. It
measured 2 3-4 inches long and 1-2 inch in diameter.
It bears a horizontal and a vertical hole. The
longitudinal hole was drilled from each end and has
a diameter of 1-4 inch. The hole drilled through the
side of the bead may have been for the purpose of
connecting the two ends of the long hole. The side
hole is 3-16 inch in diameter. The specimen shows
fair workmanship and is in an excellent state of
preservation.
The bone beads have lengths of 3 5-16 inch,
3 inch and 2 inch; diameters of 1-4 inch, 3-16 inch
and 3-8 inch. They were found at depths of 8 inch
and 12 inch. The ends of the two long beads have
been cut but none were smoothed.
The antler specimen has a maximum length of 4
1-8 inch, a minimum of 9-16 inch and a maximum
diameter of 3-4 inch. Each end bears a gouged-out
hollow 7-16 inch deep, from which runs a
longitudinal hole 1-8 inch in diameter. Around the
edge of the large end are a series of shallow notches.
The small end apparently was unfinished. Similar
antler specimens have been found in certain burntrock middens of Central and West Texas.

Included in some 400 pounds of bone and shell
were evidences of the following foods: Deer (more

opossum, raccoon; turkey, dove; mussel, snail
(few); fish—large and small; and a few tortoise.
No buffalo bones were found. No charred remains
of corn, beans or other vegetable foods were
discovered. In this connection it may be mentioned
that only five manos and no metates were found.
This, however, is not significant; early writers
mention the grinding of corn by the use of wooden
mortars and pestle.4-5-6

A “Perpetual Fire” Site
“Fire Temple”
One of the outstanding features of the place was
the housesite, outlined by postholes. Before the
digging had progressed very far several holes were
discovered. (See map No. 2). These first finds
appeared to be in no orderly arrangement. A few
broken animal bones and potsherds were removed
from the bottom of nearly every hole. Most of them
contained ashes and some charcoal. Some of the
holes were not vertical—as ordinarily would be
expected of postholes—but showed to have been
dug at an angle of fifty to sixty degrees. A little
farther on a series of holes with a gradual curve
came to light. When completely uncovered, the

latter proved to be almost a true circle. It had an
east-west diameter of 46 and a north-south diameter
of 43 1-2 feet. The narrow opening or doorway
was to the east. This latter fact corresponds with
Spanish accounts,7 that state:… “The Indians have
the doors of all their houses toward the east…”
The depths at which these postholes were found
ranged from 22 to 25 inches. There was no
intimation of a hole until the refuse was penetrated
to its bottom. The fact that all the holes were
overlaid with some two feet of undisturbed midden
material shows that they were dug before the camp
refuse accumulated. The holes were readily
discovered by the difference
in color of the fills. They had
been dug into solid red clay
and were in most cases filled
with a mixture of red sandy
soil, ashes and some charcoal.
While the surrounding clay
was extremely hard, the fill
was loose and easily removed
with the hand. This loose soil
probably accounts for the
finding at various depths—
particularly at the bottoms of
the holes— of a few
potsherds and broken animal
bones.

sherds came from the other hearths.
The question arises as to whether the two fire
pits located in and adjacent to the line of postholes
may have been used after the house was no longer
standing. The walls having been covered with grass
would seem to preclude the use of these hearths
while the house was standing.
The midden material was not evenly distributed
over the entire housesite. It was more plentiful just
outside to the east, and near the east and north sides
of the interior. It gradually decreased toward the
center as well as to the south and west. Around the
two latter sides was an almost barren area: where
the blackish-red midden soil contained less ashes,
charcoal; and fewer bones, shells, clay lumps,
potsherds and artifacts than any other part of the
house.

A small mound, 60 feet in diameter, located some
300 yards southeast of the large one, is made up
almost entirely of ashes. After penetrating six inches
of ash-laden surface soil, a deposit of about 95 per
cent pure ashes extended downward for 26 inches.
The ash was very loose. Intermixed with the ashes
were a few small lumps of red and yellow clay and
an occasional sand streak. There was no midden
material. Beneath the ash deposit was red clay.
On the northwest side of the small mound, a
cross section showed 6 inches of soil mixed with
ashes. From 7 to 22 inches was a stratum of hardpacked ashes, with occasional gravel and lumps of
red clay. No midden material. From 23 to 39 inches
were alternate strata of red and yellow clay and
sandy soil. Layers were irregular and merged in
spots.

A “Perpetual Fire” Site
“At the distance of a short gun shot from the
large temple, they construct two other little ones,
which they call the houses of the two Coninicis.
These, they say, are two children who were sent
from heaven by their Great Captain, to be consulted
when in doubt. . . .
“Casanas says the grand Xinesi deceived his
vassals by telling them that the two children . . .
came from the other side of heaven, that they ate
and drank, and that whenever he wanted to talk to
God, he did so through them. All the tribes were
called by the Xinesi to the house, where he kept
the two children . . . and a ceremony performed to
request favors of God. . . . Around the little box he
had placed some crumbs from the bread which the
Indians brought him as an offering. In the middle
of the box was a hole, into which tobacco was put.
The Xinesi told Casanas that the tobacco was for
the two children to smoke. . . .
“This great fire house ... is like the Metropoli of
the whole province; in addition to this one there is
a second at the Notches, and a third among the
Nacogdoches and Nasonis, to which fire was taken
from the first. Generally the Ainais and Netches
meet in the principal one; and the Nacogdoches and
Nasonis in the last. Both the former and the latter
fear that the fire will get angry with them; and to
satisfy it, they make offerings to it of their first corn,
tobacco, meat from the chase; and, in a word, all of
their crops. . . . When in need they always appeal
to the fire. . . .
“. . . . From this temple all the households of the
surrounding tribes kindled their fires, directly or
indirectly.” In 1710 Hidalgo13 wrote: “The fire the
Tejas Indians have in their houses was brought from
the house of their high priest. ... If the fire goes out
they start immediately for the house of the priest to
get new fire. It never goes out in the house of
sacrifice. . . .”

77

To Morfi’s statement that the construction of
the fire house did not differ from the other houses,
except that it was larger, Espinosa 15 adds the
following; “. . . . Their houses are built of wood
with very long, flexible laths. . . . They go the rounds
and leave at each ranch one of the little sticks, so
that he who receives it may take care to cut and
clean a lath and bring it and put it in the hole
designated for it. Another member of the household
is placed in charge of a sufficient number of men to
continue the work of lacing the laths together. These
thongs, made of the bark of a tree, are so strong
that they can not be broken between the hands,
however thin they may be. To the Indian women,
one or two from each house, is given the duty of
bringing a load of grass. This grass is coarser than
the largest wheat and is used to cover the whole
roof. ... At sunrise, upon the first call of the
messenger, each comes running with his lath on his
shoulder and puts it in the hole which he has
previously dug. The laths are placed in a circle and
in the middle they put up a very tall pole with knots
on it for climbing. Two Indians are placed oh top
on a cross made of two pieces of wood. Each
throws out a noose and seizes a lath by the top,
working in unison. They continue to tie them until
they have formed a figure like a half-orange. They
then cover the laths with heavy timbers, all working
at the same time; . . . each working upward upon
his own lath, they do not take more than an hour to
finish it from bottom to top. Others come in to
relieve them and cover the house with grass to a
thickness of three hand breadths. They work from
the bottom, exactly opposite to the way the
Spaniards thatch their houses. They work so
dexterously that a little after midday they are
finishing the hut, forming of carefully tied grass the
figure which their imagination suggests to them.
The building finished, they cut the middle post off
at the bottom and the building is thus left standing.
. . .”

Confirming the matter of the two children “sent

which they made by rubbing two little

while the Asinais and Naichas had fire

For the sake of better orientation, it
may be well to state that the “fire temple”
described above was located near the
junction of San Pedro Creek and Neches
River, in what is now the northeast edge
of Houston County. The mission at that
place was founded in 1690. The ash
mound in Anderson County, described in
the first part of this paper, is located some
35 miles up the Neches River from the
old San Francisco Mission. This distance
is about the same as that between the
above named mission and the one at
Nacogdoches, where was another fire
“temple.”
Merging of Archaeology and History
Now, let us take note of some of the
differences and similarities between the
archaeological finds in Anderson County
and the historical account in Houston
County. Among the differences are the
following:

were always kept on a certain stool in the fire
house. This may offer an explanation for the
finding in the midden of an unusually large
number of broken pipes.
15—Surrounding tribes came for fire. This
doubtless resulted in the bringing of offerings of
effigy vessels and other unusual, highly prized
articles for the keeper of the fire. That might
help to account for numerous specimens found.

17—They did not go on buffalo hunts like
the other Indians, because the perpetual fire
would go out. This may account for the lack of
buffalo bones in the midden deposit.
18—There were only three “fire houses” in
the Asinai territory in the early historic period.
Their wide separation, if a similar situation
prevailed in prehistoric times, might explain why
there is no comparable site in the near vicinity
under discussion. But one cannot be certain
about the latter until more work has been done
in the region.
Conclusion
From the foregoing it would seem that:
1—This site may be the former location of a
fire house and ash mound such as described by
early Spanish writers.

PLATE 28.
1. Fragments of earthenware pipes: (a), top;
(b), middle; (c), bottom level. Specimens
from the top bear punctate decoration;
trailed or grooved lines on those from the
middle; and undecorated ones from the
bottom level.
2. Pot knobs or “lugs” on sherds from midden
deposit. Those illustrated by A and D are most
common at this site.

2—Differences between certain details of the
historical accounts and the archaeological finds
at this site might easily be due to either or both
of two causes: (a) Lack of thorough investigation
by early observers; and the omission by them of
what were considered irrelevant details; (b)
Differences due to local variations in customs of
the aborigines and to possible changes over a
long period of time—this site seeming to be
prehistoric.

A “Perpetual Fire” Site
3—The stratum of soil above the ashes in the
mound indicates that the keeping of the “perpetual
fire” and the dumping of the ashes onto the mound
ceased before the final abandonment of the site.
The mound apparently was not used for domiciliary
purposes.
4—The finding of numerous artifacts in the
midden deposit outside, to the east of the
house, inside near the entrance and in
gradually decreasing numbers toward the
west and south, indicate that the people lived
near the entrance and that the beds, described
by the Spanish writers, were “ranged around”
the west and south half of the interior.

81

10—The work furnishes a striking example of
how history may be used to supplement
archaeology. It also suggests that one should not
blindly accept all the details of history when
archaeological evidence does not agree.
—Department of Anthropology,
University of Texas, Austin, Texas.

5—There is no proof of more than one
culture; but indications of an increase in the
practice of the ceramic art and of certain
changes in the types of ware and design
elements. This is particularly noticeable when
comparing materials from the upper and
lower levels.
6—The arrowpoints are of the small
tanged type frequently found in the
prehistoric graves of this region. None of the
very thin, sharp-pointed, tangless points, such
as are common in Caddo graves, was found
here.
7—This was an important site occupied
over a long period of time.
8—There is some evidence to indicate that
the middle level represented the so-called
“golden age” of the inhabitants of this site.
There were greater numbers of pipes, bird
effigies, beveled bone implements, perforated
discs, in that level.
9—The similarity of this prehistoric site
to some among the historic Asinai as
described by early writers, is significant. This,
coupled with the finding of the same types
of pottery in both prehistoric and historic sites
of the region, suggests a long occupancy by
the same or a closely related people.

Evidence of Early Man in North America, by E.
B. Howard, published by the University Museum
of the University of Pennsylvania, 1935. Contains
122 pages of text and illustrations including 14
pages of photographs, and 12 pages of drawings.
Size 8 by 11. Price $1.50.
This paper-covered book describes and
illustrates some excavations of E. B. Howard’s, in
Burnet Cave in New Mexico, in which he found a
generalized Folsom point in a hearth with musk ox
bones, and some sand dune blow-outs in the same
region in which Folsom points have been found in
old lake beds, close to bones of mammoths and
other extinct animals.
The photographs and drawings are unusually
good and clear, but the terminology of the text could
be improved. We note that Howard lists Abilene as
a region where only the rough generalized type of
Folsom point has been found. That statement is
erroneous, since this reviewer has found both types
of points in the same campsite near Abilene with
artifacts of the Clear Fork Complex.
Another error occurs on page 148 where we
read this statement, “E. B. Sayles and C. N. Ray, of
Abilene, Texas, have been working for a number of
years in stream and terrace deposits along the forks
of the Brazos River near Abilene, where even earlier
evidence for man in America may be satisfactorily
proved upon the completion of further studies of
that whole region.”
The construction of Howard’s statement would
imply that Mr. Sayles discovered the deeply buried
stratified campsites of the Abilene region, and that
“C. N. Ray” assisted in “working” them, whereas
the reverse of that is the truth. Reference to

Sayles then left Abilene in 1931 and only returned
for a few months in 1934 to work in this reviewer’s
discovery deeply buried stratified sites, and he has
not since then been “working” in these sites. On
the contrary this reviewer has worked and carefully
watched these deeply buried sites since he
discovered them in 1929-30.
Despite a few errors, this book contains much
valuable textual information concerning the Folsom
artifacts and also many beautiful illustrations of
them, and in the main is a valuable contribution to
the literature on this subject.

This very interesting pamphlet gives details
concerning a number of perforated skulls found in
Michigan and adjacent regions. A few of these
appear to be skulls where true trephination
operations have been performed. The major portion
however, show bones with smaller holes in them,
which probably were made with flint drills after
death. In the Michigan perforated bones the
perforations are not confined to the skulls as, is the
case, in other regions where trephination was
practiced by aboriginal tribes.

Clear Fork Culture Complex Points as “Folsom or
Yuma Points” with which we cannot agree, although
they evidently are quite old, and are sometimes
found on the same eroded surfaces, as we previously
stated in Flint Cultures of Ancient Man in Texas,
published in Vol. 6, 1934, of the Bulletin of this
Society. This type of dart point and also the Clear
Fork Culture gouges, which Sayles has renamed as
“Abilene core scrapers” and shows on Plate X of
his “Survey,” were first described by this reviewer
on the lower half of page 18, Vol. 1, September,
1929. Bulletin of this Society, and four of the Clear
Fork Culture Gouges were pictured as Figs. 8, 9,
10 and 11 of the lower panel of Plate 1 of the same
1929 Bulletin. We also pictured and described one
of these Clear Fork Culture gouges as Fig. 2, Plate
10 of Vol. 2, 1930. Bulletin of the Society in an
article in which we then stated that we had found it
on the same eroded surface with Folsom points,
which we also pictured on the same plate. In Ray,
Cyrus N., “Flint Cultures of Ancient Man,” Vol. 6,
1934, we again described, pictured, and named
Plate 18, Nos. 88 to 111 the “Clear Fork Culture
Complex.”

We do not agree with that statement. No Folsom
points of either type have ever been found in so far
as we know, in the Sand Dune Culture Complex
which Sayles has renamed “Brazos River.”*
However Yuma points have been found in the clay
stratum beneath these Sand Dune sites, which is
quite different. In the case of the beveled dart points
which Sayles erroneously lists as of “Brazos River”
type, but which belong to the Small Scraper Culture
of the Pottery Complex, several generalized Folsom
points were found. (See Ray, Cyrus N., The Pottery
Complex Artifacts of The Abilene Region, Vol. 7,
1935, Bulletin of Texas Archeological and
Paleontological Society).
The Editor has nearly all of the Folsom points
of either type ever found in this region, and none
of the typical finer type Folsom points have ever
been found in sites with small arrowheads, pottery
or beveled darts, but these finer Folsom points have
been found in eroded gullies with the Clear Fork
Complex, which contains no fine, small arrowheads,
but its points are thick, roughly fractured, with
twisted, not beveled, blades.
The photographs and drawings are good, clear,
and well done. Mr. Sayles is an excellent
photographer.
He probably has done as well with this large
order, as any other one archeologist of Texas could
have, but the subject is too complex for any one
person to do well.
Texas is physically too large, its cultures too
diversified, and too widely separated in both time
and space, to make it possible for one individual
without the close collaboration of all the workers
in the field, the assistance of all of the staff of Texas
University Anthropology Department, and many
long years of patient research by experts, to produce
a reasonably accurate survey of Texas archeology.
It is no one man’s job, even though he may have
had the best professional training possible.

Hafted Flints

Glyptodon Species

There was a dealer in artifacts in a small Texas
town several years ago, who collected arrowheads
and other flints from the farmers of the surrounding
region, and sold them by mail. In this fellow’s
collection were some hafted flint arrowheads which
he sold at rather high prices. A tale was told about
them having been found on an Indian battlefield in
Texas sixty years before. An amateur archeologist
bought several of these arrows. These flints
apparently were patinated (a chemical process
which probably takes thousands of years to
produce). The wood had an appearance of age, and
the tangs were fastened to the shafts with sinews.
But when the archeologist removed the flints from
the shafts he then saw that the person who hafted
them had neglected to use the brown stain on the
ends of the shafts covered by the sinew wrapping
like he had on the unwrapped parts, and the wood
was as white and fresh as though whittled out the
day before. The unwrapped parts had been painted

On a trip to Knox County with W. A. Riney we
collected plates of two species of glyptodon,
mammoth and mastodon teeth fragments, and
extinct horse bones. Some old cremated burials
which had been excavated by treasure hunters were
examined, and some snail shell beads overlooked
by them, were found.
New Prehistoric Burials Excavated
Four prehistoric burials have recently been
excavated in the Abilene region. Two of these are
of a type different from any previously found in the
region, in that they are extended burials. The work
will not be finished until after this Bulletin has been
printed. A full report will be printed next year.

of the Abilene region and has done some additional
excavations, in the stratum which is buried 8 feet
deep, during the past year. In a total of eight hours
digging on two days, he has dug out of this clay
bank stratum 29 bone fragments, 170 man made
flint flakes, 3 knife edge fragments, 1 flint dart head
expanded tang, 1 rough percussion flint blade, 1
flint knife point, and 1 beautifully chipped straight
edged flint spear head from which the tang and one
barb have been broken, but with one barb intact,
which is ½ inch long. This blade is 3 1/8 inches
long from the point to the end of the barb. The
finding of this artifact proves that fine barbed spear
heads were used in this region long enough to
become buried in a stratified campsite eight feet
deep. Some have supposed that all older points are
similar to the Folsom points and that barbs are a
comparatively recent development. Much of the
Editor’s observation does not confirm that idea.
We believe that it will eventually be proved that
tanged and barbed spears antedated the Folsom
points, and were also used during the same period
when that culture trait was developing, and that
their use was continuous in varied shapes, and
culture types, throughout a long period of time.
This eight feet deep stratified site probably
extends through the earth a considerable distance
from the high bank of a small creek branch of the
Clear Fork of the Brazos, to another outcrop on
the high bank of the Brazos River where the latest
digging was done. In 1929 when the writer
discovered this site, (See Science Service
publications for December, 1929), he excavated the
small creek branch outcrop, and found quantities
of charcoal, flint chips, bones, mussel shells, a horn
core, teeth and a square based knife. These bones
and teeth, mainly excavated by the Editor and Dr.
Otto O. Watts, were loaned to a representative of
an institution located in a far southwestern State
early in 1934, on a promise of a report when they
were identified. At the present time, more than two
years later, no report of any kind has been received
here.

Poor Co-operation and Public Relations
A great deal has been truly written about the
sins of omission and commission of some of the
amateurs, and all are to the point.
Many professionals deplore the bad relations
some times existing between local amateur
researchers, and the representatives of some of the
larger institutions. There are many reasons for such
conditions. In some cases due credit is not given to
the man in the field, when publication is made on
the results of his discoveries, and years of patient
research.
One of the most irritating of all the things
sometimes done to the local research man is the
obtaining of excavated materials on the promise of
their complete identification, then keeping these
materials for years without submitting any report
to their finders. We once had materials held six years
and then returned on our insistence without a report.
And then such persons sometimes complain about
poor co-operation. What can they expect?
We may be wrong, but we believe that anyone
who knows his subject can identify, or have
identified, prehistoric bones within a year’s time. If
he cannot, he should not stand in the way of those
who can, and do so. Science would advance much
faster if those of us who work at it for recreational
reasons could obtain better co-operation.
