KARL SCHMITT,
1915-1952
It will be a long time before the members of our Society,
and anthropologists everywhere, recover from the shock of
Karl’s tragic death at Magdalena, New Mexico, on August 6.
On a vacation tour with Iva and the two children, they had
spent two days at the archaeological camp of our Editor,
Curry Holden, then another two days at a camp supervised
by Jane Holden near Corona, New Mexico. Then, at Magdao
lena, a few hours after leaving the latter camp, their car was
struck by a train, which suddenly backed up without warning. Ira received a fractured hip from which she is now
recovered, and the children fortunately escaped entirely.
To those who knew Karl it is hardly necessary to attempt
an expression of the intense affection and admiration we
felt for him. A big, hearty, spirited man, he attacked a host
of archaeological and ethnological problems with unbounded
enthusiasm. Coming to the Department of Anthropology at
the University of Oklahoma in 1947, Karl embarked upon
many projects:

excavations in southern Oklahoma, and

studies of the modern Caddo and Wichita Indians, their
history, ethnology, music, dances, ceremonies, and mythology, not to mention their many personal problems of relationships .with white civilization. To each of the Indians they
met, men, women, and children, Karl and Ira became close
friends, not only as scientists, but as warm and understandLug human beings.
We learn that Iva has been offered Karl’s position at the
University of Oklahoma. To her we extend our deep sympathies and wish her every success in carrying on.
