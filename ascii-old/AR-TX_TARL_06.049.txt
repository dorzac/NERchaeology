from the Central Texas area; only those dates which appear to be
within reasonable contexts are reflected in the chart.
Column 2
is abstracted from Eddy's (1973) previous work at Laneport Reservoir; his chronology is derived ~rincipally from Sorrow and others

Column 3 shows the local
phases proposed by Sorrow and others (1967) for the Stillhouse
