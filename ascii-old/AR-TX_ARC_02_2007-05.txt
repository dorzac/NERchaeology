ABSTRACT
On February 7, 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed Shady Oaks Lane and
Brinker Road. The proposed Shady Oaks Drive extends from the Shady
Oaks Drive extension east to Loop 288, and the proposed Brinker Road
runs from Spencer Road north to the proposed Shady Oaks Drive. The
survey was done for Freese and Nichols, Inc. which is designing the
proposed roads and conducting the environmental permitting for the City
of Denton. Since Denton is a political entity of the State of Texas, a Texas
Antiquities Permit was required and permit number 4397 was issued for
the archaeological survey.
The routes were walked in their entirety and the only surface artifact was
an isolated mid-section of a bifaces. No buried cultural materials were
found in six shovel tests. Based upon the results of this survey and other
surveys in the surrounding area and in similar situations in Denton
County, AR Consultants, Inc. concludes that the study area has low
archaeological potential and that further cultural investigations are
unwarranted. Construction supervisors be advised that if buried
archaeological materials are uncovered during construction, work should
immediately cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be advised of the discovery.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Denton intends to construct two new roads in the southeastern part of the
City west of Loop 288 and north of Spencer Road. The Shady Oaks Drive Extension will
connect the present dead end with Loop 288 (Figure 1), a distance of approximately
4,200 feet. Also, the Shady Oaks Extension is to be situated upslope from the Pecan
Creek floodplain and will cross a short intermittent tributary of Pecan Creek. Brinker
Road will connect Spencer Road to the Shady Oaks Drive Extension and will be about
2,450 feet long. The entire Brinker Road is in the Upland. Both road right-of-ways are
approximately 120 feet wide.
AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the
proposed road routes. The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if
cultural materials are present, make recommendations about their significance and
determine how they might be impacted by construction. The archaeological survey was
done for Freese and Nichols, Inc. which is designing the proposed roads and doing the
environmental permitting for the City of Denton. Since Denton is a political entity of the
State of Texas, an Antiquities Permit was required and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission issued Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4397 for the
archaeological survey. Since a tributary to Pecan Creek will be crossed, possible federal
legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96515), The National Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), The Archeological and
Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No.
11593, “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment”, and Procedures for
the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CF800), Appendix C.
The scope of the project included a records review, a field survey, the recording of sites,
if present, and the preparation of a summary report. This report was written in accordance
with the guidelines for reports adopted by the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (N.D.). The
following report presents a brief description of the natural setting of the project area.
This is followed by a short discussion about Denton County archaeology and history. The
research design and methodology follow. The results of the field survey are presented as
the major chapter of the report. Recommendations conclude the text. A list of references
cited is at the end of the report.

NATURAL SETTING
Denton County is located in North Central Texas. It is bisected by the sandy soil of the
Eastern Cross Timbers in which the study area lies. The western section of the county
consists of the black soil of the Fort Worth Prairie and the eastern half consists of the
rich, black soil of the Blackland Prairie. The county is drained by the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River and several major creeks such as Clear Creek and Hickory Creek (Odom
2003).
The Lower Cretaceous-aged Woodbine Sandstone underlies the present soil surface in the
study area (Bureau of Economic Geology 1967) and the bedrock decomposition and
pedogenesis in the study area have resulted in creation of the soil association known as
the Birome-Gasil-Callisburg Association (Ford and Pauls 1980: General Soil Map). Soils
in this part of Denton County are described as being gently sloping to moderately steep
upland savannah loams that are moderately deep to deep. Detailed mapping of the county
soils (Ford and Pauls 1980:Sheets 27 and 28) shows that the upland soils of the study area
include Birome fine sandy loam with 3 to 5 percent slopes, Birome-Rayex-Aubrey
complex with 2 t 15 percent slopes, Callisburg fine sandy loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes,
Silsted fine loamy sand with 1 to 5 percent slopes and Wilson clay loam with 1 to 3
percent slopes. The intermittent tributary to Pecan Creek is mapped as containing
occasionally flooded Gowen clay. For most of the upland soils, the subsoil is described as
being 6 inches (15 centimeter) below the ground surface. The C horizon for the Gowen
clay is listed as being 45 inches (113 centimeters) below the ground surface.
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring and Yates
(1997), Humphrey and Ferring (1994), and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations
based on different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on
Ferring’s investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating
periods of rapid alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier
conditions, Ferring has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr B.P. to the present]
was a wet period with moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000-1000
yr B.P. [A.D. 1- to 1000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol was
established on the stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and its
tributaries. This interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope
analysis. Brown (1998) offers a differing interpretation based on isotopic analyses of
mussel shells from a prehistoric site (41DL270) on Denton Creek. He concludes that the
period from 1500 to 2500 yr B.P. was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after, the
environment was warmer and drier, but he points out that this interpretation may only be
applicable for the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The history and prehistory of Denton County are summarized in several reports prepared
by the University of North Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990; Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring
and Yates 1998). Prehistoric Native American settlement in Denton County began at least
10,000 years ago as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points (Crook
and Harris 1957) at the Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001).
Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff and other
Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region. The presence of exotic, i.e.,
non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled a territory where
higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw material trading.
These early people hunted now-extinct large game, but probably also foraged off the
land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000 to 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700 to 800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the counties but particularly
along the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native
foods. Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts
found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued using exotic cherts for
dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics for chipped
stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and Slaughter
1971). Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or ridges that overlook the
Elm Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have been recorded in upland areas
throughout the county. These sites appear to be Archaic in age, but none have been
thoroughly studied.
Various authors, including Bruseth and Martin (1987) and Peter and McGregor (1988),
have attempted to create a chronology for North Central Texas. The most commonly used
chronology was established by Prikryl (1990) which divides the Late Prehistoric, the time
from the use of the bow and pottery to the Historic Indian, into two periods: Late
Prehistoric I (A.D. 700 to 1200) and Late Prehistoric II (A.D. 1200 to 1700).
During Late Prehistoric I times, a small amount of pottery appears at the Baggett Branch
site, 41DL149 (Prikryl and Perttula 1995:189). Arrowheads appear about this same time
and apparently the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tools. From A.D. 1000
to 1300, pottery appears in North Central Texas that has similarities to Caddoan pottery
as well as Caddoan and Jornada Mogollon ceramics occur on sites in North Central Texas
(Prikryl and Perttula 1995). In addition houses were found at the Cobb-Pool site,
41DL148, (Peter and McGregor 1988:140) and at Bird Point Island (Bruseth and Martin
1987:182). Prikryl (1990:77) mentions the use of corn for food in North Central Texas
during this time and Todd (1999) suggests that the presence of mussel shell hoes in North
Central Texas indicates some form of farming.
During Late Prehistoric II times, it is believed that the climate was drier. Possibly bison
may have been utilized more than in Late Prehistoric I times. The presence of bisonscapula hoes, especially in northern North Central Texas, suggests an increase in

horticulture or, at least, its first appearance. This concept is supported by the presence of
sites along sandy terraces instead of the floodplain area where Late Prehistoric I sites are
found. There is a marked Plains influence in North Central Texas during this time also
Prikryl 1990:80).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric periods, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the North Central Texas area. Along Red River in Montague and Cooke
Counties and across Red River in Oklahoma, there is both archaeological and
ethnographic evidence of historic Taovayas, Wichitas and Yscanis Indians (Bell, Jelks
and Newcomb 1967; John 1992:204; Lorrain 1969) Since the Spanish could not subdue
the Indians, they made them their allies with promises of help against the Osage.
There is tantalizing evidence found on the Trinity River in Dallas County of a possible
visit by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto (Bruseth 1992). Artifacts found consist of a
chain-mail gauntlet, a halberd and a spur. Current research, however, seems to indicate
that Anglo settlers were the first non-Indians to settle in North Central Texas.
The first established European settlement in Denton County began before the mid-1800
with the establishment of the Peter’s Colony after Texas independence. These early
settlers were farmers who selected bottomland along the Elm Fork of the Trinity (Bridges
1978). Commercial farming was not important until after the Civil War, and the early
settlers were essentially self-sufficient. Besides the plants and animals they grew, wild
animals and plants were commonly consumed. Denton became the county seat in 1856.
By 1875, cotton, corn, and wheat were the main cash crops. Up to half of these crops
were grown by tenant farmers who either paid rent to the land owner for their house,
tools, and seed or by tenants who gave the landowner a third of the grain and a quarter of
the cotton or other cash crops. By the turn of the century, all of the major communities
had been established and some had passed away.
Previous Investigations
A check of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007) and sites plotted by the late R.
King Harris on the 1948 General Highway Map of Denton County failed to find any
archaeological sites listed within the study area. No historic residences were found on the
1919 Soil Map for Denton County, Texas (Carter 1918); however, a possible historic
residence is shown in the vicinity on the 1948 General Highway Map of Denton County
(Texas State Highway Department 1948). A historic site (41DN495) was recorded during
a study for a landfill at the head of a tributary to Pecan Creek approximately a mile
southeast of the study area. The site consists of a circa 1930s wooden house that has two
chimneys that burned. A hand dug well lined with sandstone and a concrete storm/root
cellar also were present as were outbuildings. Household items, clothes, metal cans,
bottles and jars and construction materials were strewn throughout the site and most of
the trash appears to be less than 50 years old.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The research design for this survey focused on if archaeological sites might be present,
and, if so, where might they be located.
The potential for prehistoric sites is considered low along the proposed road right-ofways in the upland setting based upon surveys in Denton County. Based upon the
location of the study area near roadways, the potential for a historic site is high,
especially since site 41DN495 was recorded southeast of the study area.
An even more basic, research problem also guided the survey; simply stated the question
asks “How did past people use the land, and what record of this use did they leave
behind?” Most frequently, limited-area and linear surveys of this type gather information
in response to this more open-ended research question, which guides almost all
archaeological surveys.
Methodology
The proposed road right-of-ways are approximately 120 feet wide and total about 6,650
feet in length. Shovel tests were placed on a judgmental basis in the upland setting but
were placed on both sides of the intermittent tributary to Pecan Creek as suggested by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (2002). The sandy loam was screened through a 1/4-inch
hardwire cloth screen and the pit walls were visually examined for cultural materials.
Notes on the terrain, vegetation, soils and other relevant information were made and
photographs were taken. Prior to the archaeological survey, surveyors had cut a 2 m path
through the forested area of the proposed road corridors. This allowed for excellent eyeheight visibility through the path area. Eye-height visibility in the forested areas outside
the path ranged from less than 5 to 10 meters. The archaeologists surveyed the
approximately 40 m wide corridor in meandering transects spaced approximately 20 m
apart. Less than 30 percent of the survey area was forested. Ground visibility throughout
the survey averaged 50 percent.

RESULTS
This chapter consists of various parts. The survey area is discussed, then followed by
results of the survey and conclusions derived from the results of the survey conclude the
chapter. Shovel tests are referred to generally in the text and are plotted on Figure 1.
Specific information about the shovel tests is listed in Table 1 at the end of the chapter.
Survey area
For the proposed Shady Oak Drive Extension, the terrain ranges from nearly level to
moderately steep. Trees include American elm, winged elm, hackberry, oak and eastern
red cedar. Understory vegetation includes saw greenbriar, grape vine, lichen, grama
grasses and native grasses and bushes. Some of the vegetation is shown in Figure 2. An
intermittent tributary to Pecan Creek will be crossed by the proposed route. The tributary
channel is about 3.5 m deep and 2+ m wide. Shallow, clear water was flowing on a clay
and sandstone gravel substrate (Figure 3) at the time of the visit. No buried cultural
materials were seen in the vertical banks. Near Loop 288, the land rises sharply and
appears to be artificial (Figure 4). No hill or knoll is shown on the USGS map and the
artificial hill may have been constructed to place a tower on it.

The terrain also ranged from generally level to moderately steep for the proposed Brinker
Road right-of-way to Spencer Road. The vegetation is similar except that an unimproved
pasture is to be crossed. The pasture, seen in Figure 5, was marshy at the time of the visit.

The survey
Survey began at the beginning of the proposed Shady Oaks Drive extension and went
east. The first slopes were not shovel tested due to the excellent ground visibility from
disturbance from building the existing Shady Oaks Drive extension.
Shovel test (hereafter ST) 1 was placed on the first bench west of the intermittent
tributary to Pecan Creek. The culturally sterile shovel test uncovered 14 cm of sandy clay
overlying a sandy clay subsoil that extended to 27+ cm below the ground surface. Shovel
test 2 was placed about a meter from the west bank and encountered 67 cm of culturally
sterile, laminated very fine sand and ST 3 was placed a meter from the east bank and
uncovered 22 cm of fine sandy clay overlying fine sandy clay subsoil that extended to
47+ cm below the ground surface. The shovel test was culturally sterile.
Shovel test 4 was placed on a bench as the terrain rose east from the tributary. The shovel
test uncovered 48 cm of very fine sandy loam overlying very fine sandy clay subsoil that
extended to 59+ cm below the ground surface. The shovel test was culturally sterile.

On top of a hill/knoll east of ST 4, a broken mid-section of a biface was found which is
shown in Figure 6. This was surprising considering its location. An intensive survey of
the adjacent area where the ground visibility was at least 70 percent or better failed to
discover any more cultural materials. The mid-section was sketched and photographed
and left in place. Shovel test 5 was placed on the hill and uncovered 14 cm of very fine
sandy loam overlying very fine sandy clay that extended to 32+ cm below the ground
surface. The shovel test was culturally sterile.

Figure 6.

pedestrian archaeological survey of proposed Shady Oaks Drive
Extension.

Shovel test 6 was excavated on the east bench of the ridge and encountered 21 cm of very
fine sandy loam overlying 11+ cm of very fine sandy clay subsoil. The shovel test was
culturally sterile. No shovel tests were placed east of ST 6 due to the good ground
visibility and upland setting. In addition, no shovel tests were placed on the possibly
man-made ridge shown in Figure 4. If the hill was not man-made, the top had been
removed; therefore, no shovel test was excavated. The only cultural material older than
50 years found during the intensive pedestrian survey and shovel testing of the proposed
Shady Oaks Drive Extension was the bifaces fragment.

The surveyors then returned to where the proposed Brinker Road will intersect Shady
Oaks Drive Extension and continued south. No shovel tests were placed along this
portion of the route due to the good ground visibility along the ridges and the swampy
nature of the unimproved pasture the route crosses. On top of the ridge approximately
430 feet north of Spencer Road, the proposed route crosses an area that has been
bulldozed and recent trash, Figure 7, has been thrown into the pit. No shovel tests were
excavated due to the disturbance and excellent ground visibility. No cultural materials
older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface during the survey of the Brinker
Road route.

Conclusions
Only one artifact was found during the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the
proposed Shady Oak Lane and Brinker Road. The presence of a partial biface attests to
the presence of the aboriginal inhabitants in the area, but does not provide much more
information. The bifaces may have been broken during hunting which would leave an
ephemeral testament to the aboriginal inhabitants’ presence. No artifact concentrations,
hearths or other associated features were found to indicate a camp site. Probably the
absence of a prehistoric site was due to the absence of perennial water, although a site
might be present along Pecan Creek. The absence of a historic site is probably due to the
distance from roadways

RECOMMENDATIONS

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are
present along the routes of the Shady Oaks Drive Extension and Brinker Road. Based
upon the results of the survey, AR Consultants, Inc. concludes that the study area has low
archaeological potential and that recommends that further cultural investigations are
unwarranted. We further recommend that construction supervisors be advised that buried
archaeological materials could be uncovered during construction. If this situation should
arise, work should immediately cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission should be advised of the discovery.
