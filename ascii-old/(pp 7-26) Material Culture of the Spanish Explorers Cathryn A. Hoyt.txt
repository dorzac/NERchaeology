Material Culture of the Spanish Explorers
Cathryn A. Hoyt

ABSTRACT
Very little material associated with the sixteenth century explorers has been
identified from archeological excavations in Texas. Although the brief nature of
the explorers’ visits to Texas may, in part, explain this phenomenon, another
explanation may lie in the dearth of information about sixteenth century material
culture. The author has identified specific items of material culture such as clothes,
weapons, pottery, and trade goods that were mentioned in the explorers’ accounts
and provides brief descriptions of what we should expect to find based on
archeological data and museum collections.

INTRODUCTION

The Quincentenary anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s first voyage across
the Atlantic honors one man and one voyage, but the 1992 celebrations will, in
reality, commemorate the Age of Exploration, aperiod in which European influence
was felt around the world within a few decades.
In Texas, the Age of Exploration began in 1528--when Cabeza de Vaca and
several companions were washed ashore near Galveston--and continued throughout the sixteenth century with the explorations of Coronado (1542), de Soto/
Moscoso (1542), DoCampo (1546), Espejo (1582), and Sosa (1590). The routes
traveled by these explorers through Texas are controversial, due in part to a lack of
identifiable sixteenth century contact sites.
This outline of the material culture of the sixteenth century Spanish explorers
is based on the published narratives of their expeditions and on archeological finds
from throughout the southern United States. Because of the broad nature of the
subject, special emphasis is placed here on specific material items that are mentioned in the narratives and on the durable diagnostic artifacts that may still be
preserved in archeological sites.
EXPLORERS

Clothing
Spanish soldiers of the sixteenth century did not wear uniforms like those of
their modem counterparts; instead, each individual soldier was stylishly outfitted in
silks, brocades, velvet, and lace (Figure 1). An inventory of clothing taken from
Spanish soldiers after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 included breeches
made of cloth of gold, colored cloaks with gold lace, an embroidered jerkin overlaid

with gold lace, and a blue taffeta hat trimmed with a silver band and plume of
feathers (Martin and Parker 1988:32). The finery, plumes, and bright colors were
necessary because, according to a seventeenth century Spanish military expert, they
"give spirit and strength to a soldier so that he can with furious resolution overcome
any difficulty or accomplish any valorous exploit" (Martin and Parker 1988:33).
This extravagant dress, however, was not always thought appropriate or
desirable. When de Soto called a muster before departing from San Lucar for the
New World in 1538, he noted with some disgust that, whereas the Portuguese turned
out in polished armor, the Castilians were dressed "very showily, in silk over silk,
pinked and slashed" (Lewis 1984:139). He ordered another muster for the following

day but was again disappointed to find that the Castilians were dressed i n"very sorry
and rusty shirts of mail" and were armed with very poor lances.
The recovery of European textiles from archeological sites is very rare except
under special conditions, such as the Spanish Armada wrecks of 1588, where,
preserved under sand and silt, archeologists found silk tassels, gold buttons, and a
cloak collar of silk and wool (Martin and Parker 1988; Crddit Communal 1985).
Found more frequently are brass fittings such as buckles and aglets. Aglets are
small pieces of brass rolled around the ends of laces to facilitate threading the laces
through eyelets in clothing. Brass aglets first appeared in the early fifteenth century,
when they were used to fasten hose to short jackets or doublets (Boucher 1967:196);
they were used until the seventeenth century in both functional and ornamental
roles. Aglets are still in use today, particularly on the ends of shoe laces.
Aglets have been found in several sixteenth century archeological sites,
including Nueva Cadiz, a Spanish New World site in Venezuela occupied between
about 1509 and 1545 (Willis 1980:36), the Spanish ships wrecked on Padre Island,
Texas, in 1554 (Arnold and Weddle 1978:291), the Spanish Armada vessels
wrecked off the coast of Great Britain and Ireland in 1588 (Martin and Parker
1988:34), and a late-sixteenth-century shipwreck site in Bermuda (Bermuda
Maritime Museum catalog no. 79:155-225). The aglets from these sites are made
of brass rolled to form cones averaging 22 to 25 mm in length. Often, bits of fiber
are preserved inside the aglets.
Armor

Armor, whether a three-quarter suit of plate armor or a padded jacket and coat
of mail, was a vital part of an explorer’s equipment. Baltasar de Obreg6n, author of
Cr6nica comenlario 6 relaciones de los descubrimienlos antiguos y modernos de
Nueva Espa~a y del Nuevo Mexico, which was first published in 1584, stresses the
importance of carrying good armor on expeditions. In addition to medium-mesh
coats of mail, Obreg6n recommends "helmets having flaps of chain armor on the
sides to protect the neck and the back of the head. One should wear breast plates and
jackets of buckskin, and escuaguipiles [padded armor] outside of and beneath the
armor as protection against flint-tipped arrows. It is important to have breeches of
chain armor, leather shields, horse armor, and knotty woven blankets" (Hammond
and Rey 1928:232).
Wearing such armor caused discomfort and worse among the explorers. Alvar
Ntifiez Cabeza de Vaca (Covey 1984:38) notes that "many men developed raw
wounds from the weight of their armor." In addition, European armor often proved
ineffective against the stone-tipped arrows of the Native Americans. When an
Apalachee archer demonstrated that he could shoot an arrow through two shirts of
mail at a distance of 50 paces, many of de Soto’s soldiers put aside their mail for
quilted cloth doublets which, in addition to being more effective against arrows,
were also more comfortable to wear (Ewen 1989:115-116).
By carefully studying the narratives of the explorers we can get some idea of
the types of armor that were most frequently carried. For example, Cabeza de Vaca

10

Texas Archeological Society

(Covey 1984:43) tells us that a Spanish gentleman, or hidalgo, was shot through the
neck "at the edge of his cuirass." The mention of the cuirass, a steel breastplate,
indicates that the hidalgo was probably a member of the light cavalry. During the
sixteenth century, the light cavalry wore armor consisting of a cuirass, short thigh
guards known as tassets, shoulder guards (spaulders), gauntlets, an open helmet,
and sometimes sleeves of mail (Blair 1958:119).
Perhaps the most common armor carried on the expeditions was mail. Made
into shirts, gauntlets, collars, and even breeches, mail was worn by everyone from
the commander to the expedition’s dog. Obreg6n stresses the importance of
carrying good coats-of-mail made of medium mesh,
for if it is very fine it is destroyed by rust, and arrows pierce it more readily
than if it is coarser. Thus the mesh should not be too small or too large but
medium, because that resists the force of the arrow more effectively. It
does not need to be cleaned, which is not the case with the fine mesh
[Hammond and Rey 1928:232].
In general, mail of the sixteenth century was made by wrapping a wire around
a mandrel and cutting it off into rings. The rings were then linked and the ends
riveted to secure the ring in place (Wedel 1975:187) (Figure 2). In the early sixteenth
century most mail was made from round wire (Wedel 1975; Burgess 1960).
Pieces of armor believed to date to the sixteenth century have been recovered
from several sites in the southwestern United States. Mail is reported from sites in
New Mexico (Ellis 1955), Kansas (Terry and Terry 1960; Wedel 1975), and Texas
(Olds 1976:99-101). The mail fragments from Texas, recovered from a ship of the

1554 fleet, were made of brass, rather than the more common iron. Brass mail has
also been noted from a sixteenth century site in Florida (Mitchem 1989:104).
Plate armor is less frequently found on archeological sites, although fragments
of plate armor altered into beads have been recovered from aboriginal burial
mounds in Florida (Mitchem 1989:104). A rare find consisting of a complete
breastplate was recovered from a late sixteenth century shipwreck in Bermuda
(Peterson 1967:8), but, unfortunately, due to the poor condition of the artifact and
the lack of proper conservation procedures, the breastplate disintegrated soon after
it was recovered.
Another unusual find was made in 1951 on the site of what is believed to be San
Gabriel del Unque, Ofiate’s first settlement in New Mexico. Jos6 Abeyta, a resident
of the area, unearthed a steel helmet that was later identified as a late fifteenth- or
early-sixteenth-century salade (Lambert 1952). The salade was a type of open
helmet worn by crossbowmen and arquebussiers (Peterson 1952).
Weapons
The weapons carried by the explorers fall into four main categories: (1)
personal weapons such as swords and daggers, (2) staff weapons, (3) crossbows, and
(4) firearms.
Sixteenth century illustrations (Figures 3, 4) indicate that most soldiers,
whether part of the cavalry or the infantry, were armed with both swords and small
parrying daggers. These parrying daggers, designed to be held in the left hand while
the sword was held in the right, were introduced in the fifteenth century when the
style of sword play changed from a cutting to a thrusting action. During the fifteenth
and early sixteenth centuries, the daggers had disk-shaped guards and cylindrical
pommels (Stone 1934:199). By 1550, however, swords and parrying daggers were
made with matching hilts (Norman and Wilson 1982:25).
A well-preserved sword of this period was recovered by archeologists from a
site in northwestern Georgia that is believed to have been visited by de Soto in the
summer of 1540. Other evidence of Spanish swords from the same site was found
in a mass grave where one of every five Native American skeletons bore slash marks
made by European, rather than aboriginal, weapons (Blakely 1989:30).
Staff weapons are the weapons most frequently mentioned in the explorer’s
accounts. Although the general term lance is most commonly used, contemporary
illustrations indicate that several different types of staff weapons were used.
True lances were carried by the cavalry. The lance was 10 to 14 feet long with
a leaf-shaped iron blade at the end. The heavy infantry carried a somewhat similar
weapon known as a pike. The pike was slightly longer than a lance, ranging in length
from 16 to 20 feet, but had a similar leaf-shaped blade at the end. Between the midfifteenth and mid-seventeenth centuries, the pike was a very popular defense against
the cavalry. The long pikes held the cavalry at bay while the musqueteers and
crossbowmen reloaded their weapons.
Other iron staff weapons used during the sixteenth century and illustrated in
contemporary drawings were the partizan--an Italian weapon introduced in the

fifteenth century--the pollaxe--a popular weapon of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuriesiand the halberd a long-handled axe that was used throughout Europe
during the sixteenth century (Stone 1934; Norman and Wilson 1982).
Another weapon mentioned with some frequency is the crossbow. Crossbows
were one of the principal weapons carried on all of the early expeditions, but by the

last quarter of the sixteenth century they had been replaced by firearms as the
military weapons of choice. Several nearly complete examples were recovered from
the wrecks of the 1554 fleet (Olds 1976; Arnold and Weddle 1978), but crossbows
or crossbow fragments are very rare from terrestrial sites. However, evidence for
their use is found in the recovery of steel and copper tips from crossbow quarrels.
Crossbow quarrels--the shafts shot from crossbows--were much shorter and
heavier than the arrows used with long bows. Points for crossbow quarrels had solid,
pyramid-shaped tips and constricted necks that fit over the quarrel shafts (Figure 5).
Several quarrel points made of copper were recovered from the early excavations
of Pecos Pueblo and "Bandelier’s Puaray" in New Mexico (Ellis 1957:209). Iron
points have also been excavated from a Florida site believed to be Hernando de
Soto’s winter camp of 1539-1540 (Ewen 1989:116). All of these points, both
copper and iron, are 4 to 5 cm (1.5 to 2.0 in.) long.
Two types of military firearms--the matchlock arquebus and the musket-were carried on sixteenth century explorering expeditions. In the early sixteenth
century the arquebus or hacabuche, was a firearm more than 5 feet long, often
weighing as much as 35 pounds. By the mid-sixteenth century, however, the term

14

210).
musket was used to describe these heavier weapons, and the term arquebus referred
to a smaller firearm that weighed 14 to 18 pounds (Lavin 1965; Kist et al. 1974).
Because of the great weight and size of the military muskets, forked rests were
needed to prop the guns up while they were being fired.
In archeological contexts we are most likely to recover pieces of the ignition
mechanism, such as lockplates or serpentines, from these types of weapons, or
fragments of the wrought iron barrels. Although other ignition systems such as the
wheel-lock, snaphance, and flintlock, were developed during the sixteenth century,
the simple matchlock was preferred for exploration expeditions. As late as 1596,
Pedro Ponce de Le6n requested 500 arquebuses and 100 muskets for a voyage to the
Indies. These were presumably matchlock weapons, as the scribe noted that Ponce
de Le6n"understood that they used wheel locks in the Indies and now he knows that
although they are available it is not suitable to take them on this discovery" (Lavin
1965:47).
The preference for matchlocks lay in the simplicity of the firing mechanism.
Obreg6n, in his equipment list for expeditions, warns that "most [of the firearms]
should be operated by fuse because it often happens that the damp powder makes
the firing of the flintlocks difficult. Moreover the harquebuses with fuses are easier
to handle. The ones with flintlocks often need a mechanic to make repairs and to
replace the pieces that get out of order" (Hammond and Rey 1928:232).
The origin of a sixteenth century firearm can often be determined from the
shape of the stock. The Spanish preferred to rest the butts of their guns against their
shoulders, so their stocks had flared ends. French guns had sharply curved stocks
because the French held their guns against their chests to shoot, whereas the
Germans preferred straight, narrow stocks because they held their guns to their

Hoyt m Material Culture of Spanish Explorers

cheeks and rested the stocks on their shoulders. By the early seventeenth century,
most nations had adopted the Spanish-style gun.
In addition to the private weapons and small arms carried by the Spanish
soldiers, Coronado took four bronze cannons on his expedition. Traveling with
cannons through the southwestern desert must have taken a toll on both men and
cannons, because eventually the guns, described as being in poor condition, were
left at the village of Chia (Winship 1922:62).
ANIMALS

In addition to the remains of sixteenth century weapons, other indicators of
contact period sites can be found in faunal assemblages. The earliest explorers rode
horseback and were accompanied by dogs. Several Indian tribes encountered by the
explorers had dogs; horses, after becoming extinct in North America during the
Pleistocene, were reintroduced to the New World by the Spanish in the sixteenth
century. Horses were taken on all of the exploring expeditions and were believed
to be"the most necessary things in the new country, because they frighten the enemy
most, and after God to them belongs the victory" (Abbass 1986:22).
However, the use of horses was both a blessing and a curse. The increased
mobility that horses gave the Spanish was tempered by the fact that the cavalry was
effective only in open terrain. Finding fodder for the horses was a problem in the dry
Southwest, and many horses died while crossing mountains, fording rivers, and
wading through the swamps of the Southeast. The de Soto expedition departed
Havana with about 250 horses and returned with less than 30 (Swanton 1985:89-

9O).
Finding food and dealing with the environment were major problems, but other
factors also took their toll. Obreg6n warned that
large quantities of iron for horseshoes and the largest possible amount of
nails should be brought. If the iron gives out during the expedition it causes
great inconvenience and makes it impossible to go any farther, as happened on our expedition. Because the horseshoe nails gave out we were
forced to turn back, leaving many horses behind [Hammond and Rey
1928:233].
Wrought iron nails, believed to be from the de Soto expedition, and horseshoes,
believed to date to the expedition of Tristan de Luna (1559-1561), have been
recovered from archeological sites in Florida and Alabama (Hudson etal. 1989:131).
DAILY LIFE
The chronicles of the expeditions give very little information about the day-today lifestyle of the explorers. However, from a passing reference to a hailstorm that
"broke all the crockery of the army" (Winship 1922:69) and from the archeological
record, particularly in Florida, we know that various types of utilitarian and

16

Texas Archeological Society

tableware ceramics were carried by the explorers. Because of the large body of
literature concerning Spanish ceramics and the wide variety of ceramics in use
during the sixteenth century, this discussion touches only on pottery that has been
associated with sixteenth century exploring expeditions (see Deagan [1987],
Goggin [1964, 1968], and Lister and Lister [1974, 1976, 1982] for more detailed
information about sixteenth century ceramics).
The utilitarian ware most frequently encountered on early Spanish sites is
probably the coarse earthenware Olive Jar (Figure 6). These amphora-shaped jars
with constricted necks were the cardboard boxes of their day and were used to
transport and store many types of goods, such as olive oil, olives in brine, wine,
beans, chick peas, lard, and tar (Goggin 1964:256).
Although Olive Jars were in use from about 1490 through the late eighteenth
century, the type most frequently encountered on early contact sites is Goggin’s
Early Style Olive Jar. These jars are characterized by their globular form, flaring,
everted mouth, two strap handles set high on the shoulders of the jar, and interiors
often with a bright emerald to muddy brown lead glaze; the outsides characteristically have a thin white slip. Vessel walls range in thickness from 4 mm to 12 mm

u

17

(Goggin 1964). Early Style Olive Jars are most frequently found on Spanish sites
dating to the first three-quarters of the sixteenth century. By around 1570, the Early
Style jars were being replaced with the handleless Middle Style jars with their
distinctive ring-shaped necks and egg-shaped bodies (Goggin 1964; Deagan 1987).
Other coarse earthenwares recovered from sites associated with sixteenth
century explorers include Green Bacfn ware (Mitchem 1989:104), a sixteenth
century utilitarian earthenware distinguished by the emerald green lead glaze on the
interior of the vessel (Deagan 1987). Although Green Bacfn ware does not appear
in sites after about 1600, care should be exercised when working with collections
from the American Southwest, where very similar wares were imported from
Mexico in the eighteenth century (Barnes 1980).
Archeologists have also recovered fine earthenwares from a site associated
with the winter camp of the de Soto expedition in Florida (Ewen 1989:114). Two
types of tin-glazed earthenware and an unglazed bisque ware known as Bizcocho
ware have been identified. Bizcocho ware is made of a fine paste that was molded
into ornate shapes and decorated with incised lines and appliqudd figures. Bizcocho
ware has been found on Spanish sites throughout the Caribbean in contexts that date
before 1550 (Deagan 1987:43).
The tin-glazed earthenware recovered from the de Soto site in Florida includes
Columbia Plain ware and Caparra Blue ware. Columbia Plain ware is the most
frequently encountered tin-glazed earthenware found in the New World and dates
from initial contact through the early seventeenth century. The vessels are made of
a fine, cream colored paste covered with an off-white, cream, or greyish tin enamel.
The vessel forms most often found are broad-rimmed plates (platos) or bowls
(escudillas) (Deagan 1987:56) (Figure 7). Caparra Blue is another distinctive early
sixteenth century tin glazed earthenware. According to Kathleen Deagan (1987:63),
the only vessel form known for this ware is the albarelo, or Spanish drug jar (Figure
8). These jars, found on Spanish sites in pre- 1550 contexts, have white or off-white
glaze on the interiors and solid blue glaze on the exteriors.
TRADE GOODS

Although armed to the teeth and quick to use their weapons, the Spanish
exploring expeditions followed their official policy of conquering with goodwill
rather than brute force. To this end, the exploring parties carried large quantities of
trade goods for distribution to the native populations, de Soto’s trade goods included
bolts of cloth, iron tools, glass trinkets and mirrors, and beads and bells (Swanton
1985:55). The importance of these trade goods to the explorers is illustrated by the
fact that Cabeza de Vaca, after surviving six weeks at sea and a shipwreck, was still
able to give beads and bells to the Indians he encountered shortly after his landfall
near Galveston (Covey 1984:56).
Beads
Since many excellent publications have dealt with the identification of early
trade beads (e.g., Smith and Good 1982; Deagan 1987; Smith 1983), only the most

distinctive of the sixteenth century trade beads are discussed here.
One of the best indicators of the early sixteenth century are the large, squaresectioned, drawn-glass Nueva Cadiz Plain beads (Figure 9), which are always found

in contexts predating 1550 and have been found in sites in Florida, Georgia, and
Alabama that are associated with the de Soto expedition and other early explorers
(Mitchem and Leader 1988; Milanich and Milbrath 1989). These beads are made of
clear, turquoise, navy, light blue, or opaque glass in one to three layers (Deagan
1987:163). (The variety of three color combinations is well illustrated in the bead
collection from Tatham Mound in Florida [Mitchem and Leader 1988]). The color
combinations include cobalt blue and thin white with a translucent medium blue
core; turquoise blue and thin white with a navy blue core, cobalt blue and thin white
with a translucent light blue core, translucent navy blue and thin white with a
translucent navy blue core, and turquoise blue and thin white with a translucent
purple core. Single-colored Nueva Cadiz beads of translucent dark navy blue,
translucent cobalt blue, and transparent cobalt blue were also recovered.
Another distinctive sixteenth century bead type is the Chevron or Rosette bead
(Figure 10), made of multilayered red, white, and blue glass that forms a star when
viewed from the end. The sixteenth century Chevron beads are usually faceted and
made up of seven distinct layers, but by the seventeenth century, Chevron beads had
only five layers and were usually tumbled (Deagan 1987:164-165). Chevron beads
have been recovered from several sites in Florida associated with the de Soto
expedition (Mitchem and Leader 1988; Mitchem 1989:107).

Although they are the most distinctive, Nueva Cadiz and Chevron beads are not
the only types of beads used for trade during the sixteenth century, for shipping
records of the period mention green, yellow, clear,"colored", blue, black, and white
beads made of glass, coral, jet, metal, bone, and stone (Deagan 1987). The wide
variety of beads manufactured during the sixteenth century has been well illustrated
( See Smith and Good 1982).
Bells

Small brass bells, often called hawk’s bells, were another important item in the
explorer’s trading kit. The bell most often associated with sixteenth century Spanish
sites is known as the Clarksdale bell (Figure 11). According to Mitchem and
McEwan (1988:39 40),
a Clarksdale bell is characterized by a wide (ca. 5 mm) attachment loop
which was secured by pushing the ends through a hole in the top and
soldering the separate ends to the interior, a square flange around the
"equator" where the two hemispheres were crimped together, an
undecorated surface, and two holes connected by a narrow slit in the lower
hemisphere.
These bells have been recovered from early contact period sites throughout the
Southeast (Mitchem and McEwan 1988:44).

Hoyt-- Material Culture of Spanish Explorers

21

A second type of bell known as the Flushloop bell is also found on contact
period sites (Figure 12). Flushloop bells are distinguished from Clarksdale bells by
the method of joining the two hemispheres of the bell and attaching the loop. The
attachment loops for Flushloop bells are much thinner than those of Clarksdale bells
and were secured by pushing the loops through holes in the bells and spreading the
ends apart on the interior. The two hemispheres of the bell were not crimped together
as in Clarksdale bells, but instead were soldered flush together (Mitchem and
McEwan 1988:40). Studies have shown that Flushloop bells are most often
associated with British or French contact period sites dating to the seventeenth
century and later (Mitchem and McEwan 1988).

Tools

Although not as well documented as beads and bells, iron tools were also
carried as trade or gift items by the late sixteenth century. At least 61 chisels, 77
wedges, 72 hatchets, 30 knives, and one adze were given to the chiefs and other
important men encountered by Juan Pardo during his exploring expedition of 15661568 in the southeast (DePratter and Smith 1980:70-71). Whether the earlier
exploring expeditions carried iron tools is uncertain; the members of the Narvfiez
expedition found themselves without tools when they considered building a boat to
leave Florida (Covey 1984:45).
Tools are one of the most difficult artifacts to date accurately. They changed
very little through time and, because of the rarity of sixteenth and seventeenth
century examples, adequate typologies have not yet been developed. However,

22

Texas Archeological Society

well-preserved tools from sixteenth century contexts are being recovered from both
land and underwater sites (e.g., Milanich and Milbrath 1989; Cr6dit Communal
1985; Rule 1982; Hoyt 1985; DePratter and Smith 1980), greatly increasing the
potential for learning about the development of early historic tools.
CONCLUSIONS

The trail of the Spanish explorers has been closely followed by researchers
throughout the Southeast, into the Plains area, and among the pueblos of New
Mexico. However, very little sixteenth century material has actually been identified
in Texas. There are many reasons for this, including the difficulty of identifying
sixteenth century artifacts, as well as the nature of the explorer’s visits to Texas.
Unfortunately, most explorers who ventured into Texas were just passing
through. We do not have the winter camps or other sites that represent long-term
Spanish occupation during the sixteenth century. Even the overnight campsites, as
Moscoso’s group found, were quickly stripped of artifacts by the Indians who"were
accustomed to come and search the camp for whatever of value might have been left
within it" (Vega 1988:526).
However, the ethereal nature of the explorers’ contact with Texas should not
discourage attempts to expand our knowledge of this fascinating period in Texas
history. The Quincentenary observations in 1992 provide the perfect impetus for
renewal of interest in this period by studying privately owned and museum
collections, thereby contributing to the story of the sixteenth century explorers in
Texas and in North America as a whole.
