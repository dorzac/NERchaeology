ABSTRACT
Prewitt and Associates, Inc., (PAI) conducted archeological and historical investigations
of a portion of Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá within the Texas Department of Transportation
right of way along FM 2092 in Menard County, Texas. Established to convert the Apache and
occupied only for 11 months in 1757–1758, the mission was attacked and destroyed by hostile
northern tribes on March 16, 1758. Of the mission inhabitants, 2 Catholic priests and 10 others
were killed, but 1 priest and many others survived to give eyewitness accounts of the event. The
mission site provides a narrow window into the existence of a small, mid-eighteenth-century
mission on the northern frontier of the Spanish empire.
The archeological investigations in 2006–2007 included hand excavations in a 3-m-wide
and 80-m-long strip where intact Spanish colonial deposits were preserved along the north
edge of the road right of way. This evidence complements and builds on the previous 1990s
archeological investigations by Texas Tech University (TTU) of the main mission area north
of FM 2092. Although there was evidence of postdepositional disturbances from many sources,
PAI documented nine features associated with the mission: postholes and posts, an ash lens
representing the mission-burning episode, a bone dump pit, and a concentration of Spanish
artifacts. The material culture assemblage includes 112 Spanish colonial and probable Spanish
colonial artifacts, over 22 kg of fired daub, and hundreds of animal bones and botanical samples.
Analyses of all these materials, including examination of horizontal and vertical distributions,
indicate that the linear PAI investigations represent an area close to the southern edge of the
mission compound, including areas where wattle-and-daub (jacal) structures burned.
Three special studies for sourcing artifacts are also reported. A petrographic analysis and
an instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) were conducted on selected ceramics from
Mission San Sabá and other Spanish colonial sites in Texas. These studies reveal interesting
patterns, and the INAA data suggests (1) chemical overlap between some Spanish colonial
ceramic types, and (2) possible connections in the Spanish transportation network that linked
Mission San Sabá to other Texas missions. A lead isotope analysis reveals that the PAI-recovered
lead artifacts came from Mexico and probably represent bulk lead stored in structures that were
burned during the mission attack.
Analyses of two unusual sources add to the overall story of Mission San Sabá. One
focuses on the Destruction of Mission San Sabá, a large-format painting created in the 1760s to
document the attack on the mission and the martyrdom of the two priests. Examined in depth
from a historic archeological perspective for the first time, this graphic image incorporates many
themes, stylistic techniques, and symbolism typical of eighteenth-century Spanish paintings.
The analysis reveals that it had many integrated political and social identity messages that
were easily understood by contemporary viewers. The other analysis focuses on the Inventory
of Supplies, an itemized listing of the supplies and services purchased for the expedition from
Mexico City to establish the mission on the San Saba River. This document, the only known
founding inventory for a Spanish mission in Texas, was retranslated and compared with the
material culture recovered from the mission.
The PAI archeological data, taken in context with the available TTU archeological
evidence and the wealth of historical documents examined, tell a comprehensive story about

iii

Mission San Sabá and its role in the history of Spanish Texas. The only mission to have been
attacked and destroyed by Native Americans opposing the expansion of the Spanish empire, the
history of the San Sabá affair highlights the complex and rapidly changing nature of Spanish
and Native interactions in the eighteenth century.

CURATION
All of the project records and recovered cultural materials from the Mission San Sabá
project, including the survey/testing phase and the data recovery phase, will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin. The curation of these
materials will fulfill the final requirements of Texas Antiquities Permits 4192 and 4317.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the archeological survey/testing and data recovery
excavations of a small portion of the Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá site (41MN23) in Menard
County, Texas. This project was initiated because of a road-improvement project undertaken by
the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Designated by TxDOT as CSJ No. 2008-01091, this road work involved widening of a 4.9-mile-long stretch of FM 2092 east of the city of
Menard; the expansion occurred entirely within the existing State-owned right of way and did
not involve acquisition of new right of way. As the planning for the expansion got underway,
TxDOT archeologists knew that the road ran across the southern edge of Mission San Sabá, a
Spanish colonial mission established for the Catholic conversion of the Apache peoples in 1757
and destroyed 11 months later by other Native Americans. TxDOT archeologists knew that
Texas Tech University archeologists had conducted investigations of the portion of the mission
on the privately owned property immediately north of FM 2092. They were also keenly aware
that the mission site probably extended southward into the road right of way and that intact
and significant mission-related remains might be preserved there.
Under contract with TxDOT’s Archeological Studies Program within the Environmental
Affairs Division, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI), initiated the first archeological work for
the FM 2092 road-improvement project in 2006, and work continued intermittently until
completion of this report in 2018. These efforts were funded under four contracts (Contract
Nos. 575XXSA006, 577XXSA001, 579XXSA002, and 577XXSA003) and six work authorizations
(see below). All of these archeological and historical investigations were conducted in compliance
with pertinent provisions within Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (United
States Code, Title 54), the Section 106 Regulations—Protection of Historic Properties (36 CFR
Part 800), the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191),
and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code (Texas Administrative Code,
Title 13, Chapter 26). In compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas, these investigations
were authorized by Texas Antiquities Permit Nos. 4192 and 4317, issued to PAI’s principal
investigator, Douglas K. Boyd. The specific projects, tasks, and timeline of the investigations
are as described below.

iv

WA No. 57536SA006, PAI Project 206015: This project consisted of prefield planning
and preparing an Antiquities Permit Application Form and scope of work for cultural resources
survey of 4.9 miles of State-owned right of way along FM 2092. The work was initiated and
completed early in 2006, but the project was delayed and the permit application was not
submitted. Because Mission San Sabá was known to be adjacent to the right of way, the scope
of work outlined a plan for subsurface testing in the right of way during the initial survey.
WA No. 57540SA006, PAI Project 206025: This project involved seven main tasks: (1)
revising the Antiquities Permit Application Form for an intensive survey and geoarcheological
study of the 4.9-mile-long section of FM 2092; (2) conducting a literature review and historical
research relating to Mission San Sabá, along with transcribing and translating of selected
documents containing information related to the mission; (3) conducting historical research
related to the historical Menard Irrigation Company and the canal system; (4) detailed mapping
and a limited metal detector survey in the mission search area, along with subsurface testing
of selected areas of Mission San Sabá within the FM 2092 right of way; (5) conducting the
archeological survey; (6) preparing a preliminary letter report summary immediately after the
survey was completed; and (7) preparing an interim draft report on the survey.
The survey and testing were authorized by Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4192, which was
issued in early July 2006. No specific road construction details were available, so the horizontal
Area of Potential Effects (APE) was defined to include the entire road right of way; the vertical
APE was considered to extend 3 ft below the current ground surface, as it was assumed that
road construction could impact deposits to that depth. The field investigations were conducted in
July 2006, and a preliminary report summarizing the results was produced in September 2006
(Boyd et al. 2006). PAI recommended that the portion of Mission San Sabá within the right of
way was eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (as per 36 CFR 60.4) and
for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (as per Subchapter D of the Antiquities Code of
Texas). TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred with this recommendation,
and TxDOT immediately issued a work authorization to begin data recovery investigations at
the mission site (McWilliams and Boyd 2008:50; Pletka 2007).
WA No. 57548SA006, PAI Project 206051: This project was authorized by Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 4317 (issued November 2006) and involved four main tasks: (1) conducting
the data recovery excavations of the portion of Mission San Sabá within the FM 2092 right of
way; (2) conducting additional historical research related to the mission; (3) creating a popular
brochure on the history of the Menard Irrigation Company; and (4) conducting subsurface
testing of a nearby Toyah phase site, 41MN55 (later named the Fivemile Crossing site). The
field investigations were conducted from November 2006 through February 2007, and an interim
report was prepared to summarize the work at the mission (McWilliams and Boyd 2007). A
public outreach brochure, titled The Menard Irrigation Canal: 250 Years of Agricultural History,
1757–2007, was published in 2007, and copies were distributed to the public in Menard during
the commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of Mission Santa Cruz de San
Sabá and the nearby Presidio San Sabá.
WA No. 57720SA001, PAI Project 207047: This work authorization provided the
funding for producing and printing two final reports from previously prepared draft reports. One
is the final report on the FM 2092 survey, by McWilliams and Boyd (2008), which was published
in January 2008. It includes a geoarcheological assessment of the survey corridor, data on 10

v

previously recorded sites (including the mission), data on 10 newly discovered sites, and historical
and informant data on 17 historic localities and 5 ditch crossings where the roadway crosses
the irrigation canal. It also includes a detailed history of the Menard Irrigation Company and
the canal system. However, this final report did not include descriptive details of the mission
testing because it was decided that it was more appropriate to include this information with
a later publication that would include the archeological data recovery effort. The second final
report funded by this work authorization was published in December 2007, and it presents the
results of the Spanish document study by Mariah F. Wade (2007), an anthropology professor
at the University of Texas at Austin. This book presents 10 Spanish documents, each having
a facsimile of the hand-written original, a transcription of the original Spanish text, and a
translation into English.
WA No. 57901SA002, PAI Project 209005: This project involved the intensive analysis
of the artifact and feature data from the Mission San Sabá testing and data recovery, followed
by reporting of the findings. This consisted of many diverse studies conducted by a variety of
specialists: faunal analysis by Brian S. Shaffer; macrobotanical analysis by Leslie L. Bush; lithic
analysis by John E. Dockall; analysis of fired daub by Mark R. Wolf; a ceramic geochemical
sourcing study using neutron activation analyses by Jeffrey R. Ferguson and Michael D. Glascock;
a lead isotope sourcing study by Steven Schooler; spatial analyses of artifacts by Jennifer K.
McWilliams and Douglas K. Boyd; historical assessment of the famous 1760s Destruction of
Mission San Sabá painting by Boyd and McWilliams; and detailed historical analysis of the
material culture described in the 1756–1757 Inventory of Supplies for the Mission San Sabá
expedition by McWilliams. All of the ceramic descriptions and analyses, including the geochemical
sourcing study, followed the protocols outlined in “TxDOT’s Ceramic Standards and Guidelines”
(Texas Department of Transportation 2010). The results of all of these investigations were
compiled into a draft technical report that was submitted to TxDOT July 2012. This draft was
subsequently edited and transformed into this final technical report. Also as part of this work
authorization, PAI completed the draft report on the testing of the Fivemile Crossing site in
2012. This draft report was subsequently edited and transformed into a final report (Boyd
and Mehalchick 2017) under a separate work authorization (WA No. 57705SA003, PAI Project
207012).
WA No. 57706SA003, PAI Project 217014: In 2017, a final work authorization was
issued for the FM 2092 project, and it funded the production of this final technical report. The
work included addressing review comments on the draft report by TxDOT staff and other
outside reviewers, producing a proof copy of the final report, and printing and distribution of
the final reports. It also funded preparation of the artifact collections and project records for
permanent curation at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, the University of Texas
at Austin. Completion and distribution of this report and curation of the project records and
artifacts, along with the concurrent completion and distribution of the report on the testing at
the Fivemile Crossing site, fulfill the requirements of Texas Antiquities Permit Nos. 4192 (for
the FM 2092 survey and Mission San Sabá testing) and 4317 (for the Fivemile Crossing site
testing and Mission San Sabá data recovery).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The multidisciplinary cultural resources studies at Mission San Sabá conducted by
Prewitt and Associates, Inc., were directly supervised by the Texas Department of Transportation’s
Environmental Affairs Division (TxDOT-ENV), with John Arnn serving as primary contact and
Jim Abbott assisting with geomorphology concerns. Personnel from TxDOT’s San Angelo District
Office included Nancy Fisher and Ann Maxwell of the ENV Department and Public Information
Officer Karen Threlkeld. Emiliano Gonzales and Guy Wagoner of the Menard Maintenance
Office scheduled auger, backhoe, and Gradall services as well as safety coordination. Wagoner
was especially helpful with fulfilling any of our logistical needs while we were in the field.
Three people deserve special recognition for their many contributions to this project.
Kay Hindes, Mark Wolf, and Dr. Grant Hall (archeologist, Texas Tech University) are the
original team of San Sabá investigators, and Hall directed all of the Texas Tech investigations
in the 1990s. All three were intimately involved in the previous historical and archeological
work on the portion of Mission San Sabá located on private property, and they all served as
consultants to Prewitt and Associates for this project. They shared freely of their valuable time
and knowledge, providing advice and guidance from the fieldwork phase through the analyses
and interpretations. Wolf and Hindes shared with us their historical research files compiled over
many years. And Hall shared his vast knowledge of the site, provided us with preliminary Texas
Tech University maps, and allowed us to identify some of the botanical remains from the Texas
Tech University collections as well as to conduct geochemical studies on some of the ceramics.
The many contributions of Hindes, Wolf, and Hall are interwoven throughout the fabric of this
report, and their efforts are greatly appreciated.
Several other researchers have contributed to the studies presented in this report. Dr.
William Doolittle (University of Texas geographer-anthropologist) visited the site with us to
give his advice on where the Mission San Sabá acequia might have been located. Dr. Anne
Fox (retired archeologist, University of Texas at San Antonio) provided her thoughts on the
type identifications of the Prewitt and Associates ceramics. And Dr. Tamra Walter (Texas Tech
University archeologist), who directed the Texas Tech University investigations at Presidio San
Sabá over many years, provided many insights on a variety of Spanish colonial topics. She also
allowed us to sample some of the presidio ceramics in the Texas Tech University collections for
the geochemical sourcing study. As TxDOT’s lead project reviewer, Arnn provided advice and
insights based on his knowledge of the protohistoric period European and Native interactions
in Texas.
Thanks go to Monte and Susie Lyckman, owners of the land immediately north of
FM 2092 where the mission site is located, for all their cooperation. They were very hospitable
during all of our fieldwork, and they allowed us access to their land to look for likely mission
field locations and acequia remains. Dr. Jake Landers, a local landowner and Texas A&M
University extension range specialist, offered his knowledge of the area and his estimates of
the ages of the cypress and other trees along FM 2092. Local informant Jerry Rambo provided
extensive information on the history of FM 2092 during an interview conducted by Kay Hindes
and Jennifer McWilliams.

For Prewitt and Associates, Doug Boyd served as the principal investigator, and Jennifer
McWilliams was the project archeologist. Bennett Kimbell, Jennifer (Hatchett) Kimbell, and
J. Cory Broehm served as crew members during the survey and testing phase. Crew members
on the data recovery excavations were J. Cory Broehm, M. Beth Sain, Matt Carter, Joel Butler,
and Chris Kugler.
This report represents the work of many talented people. Prewitt and Associates
archeologist John Dockall conducted analysis of Native-made lithic artifacts, and seven
consultants contributed to the analyses of the Mission San Sabá archeological remains. Stephen
Schooler conducted the isotopic analysis of lead artifacts recovered to build on his previous
isotopic analysis of the Texas Tech University lead artifacts. Mark Wolf conducted the analysis
of the fired daub from our investigations, as he did for the daub from the Texas Tech University
investigations. Dr. Brian Shaffer conducted the faunal analysis, and Dr. Leslie Bush conducted
the botanical analysis. Two specialized compositional sourcing studies were conducted on
ceramics: petrography by David Robinson and instrumental neutron activation analysis by Jeff
Ferguson and Michael Glascock (University of Missouri Research Reactor). All of these studies
contribute immensely to the interpretations of the mission occupation at San Sabá as well as
to Spanish colonial history in Texas.
And finally, this report was edited by Elaine Robbins and Ross C. Fields, and the figures
were produced by Sandy Hannum and Brian Wootan. Their patience and dedication are greatly
appreciated.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO THE MISSION
SAN SABÁ PROJECT
Douglas K. Boyd and Jennifer K. McWilliams

The Spanish colonial presence in Menard County, Texas, is well known to
the local residents. They have seen the location of the historical marker at the site
of Mission San Sabá (Figure 1.1). They play golf on the grounds where the ruins of
the presidio, or fort, still stand. Some of the farmers in the San Saba River valley
irrigate their crops using the Menard Irrigation Company canal, which follows the
route of the old Spanish acequia (see Figure 1.1). But like many people, they still
have misconceptions about the period when the Spanish tried to establish a mission
to Christianize the Apache and settle the area. For example, many locals mistakenly
believe the Spanish once had productive silver mines in Menard County, and it is
commonly thought that silver mining was one of the primary motivations for the
establishment of the presidio and mission there. Many confuse the presidio ruins
with the mission, which was actually about 4 miles away.
The widening of a small farm-to-market road undertaken by the Texas
Department of Transportation starting in 2007 provided an opportunity to place the
mission in a clearer historical context (Figure 1.2). The investigations associated
with Mission San Sabá revealed new physical evidence as well as many primary
and secondary historical sources. This combination of archeological and historical
evidence has shed new light on the mid-eighteenth-century Spanish missionization
efforts in Texas.
STORIES OF MISSION SAN SABÁ
There are many stories about the place where the mysterious Mission San
Sabá once stood. Some relate to the establishment and occupation of the mission.
Some relate to the mission’s violent destruction and the aftermath of this event.
Some relate to the mission location being lost and rediscovered, and what happened
to it in the interim. The 1757–1758 Mission San Sabá was the farthest outpost on
the northern frontier of New Spain but lasted only 11 months. The Spanish clergy
and military came to the area with several specific but sometimes contradictory
goals in mind. The Catholic church sought to Christianize the Apache peoples,
but their goals were often in conflict with the broader Spanish goals of promoting
settlement in the region, containing the hostile Indian tribes, and gaining wealth
by exploiting what they perceived as valuable mineral resources. The relationships
between the Spaniards and the various Native peoples who inhabited the northern
frontier were complex. It was cultural differences and social conflicts among these
groups that ultimately led to the attack on Mission San Sabá by the Norteños, a

coalition of northern tribes that wanted neither the Apache nor the Spanish in
their territory. There are stories of early Anglo settlers finding burned post stumps
and human skulls when plowing their fields at the old mission site. Then there are
the stories of how the abandoned mission site was forgotten early in the twentieth
century. The mission’s location became lost in modern memory so completely that
the mission has often been confused with the well-known and historically related
site of Presidio San Sabá in the nearby town of Menard (see Figure 1.1).
A portion of the site was disturbed as the early Anglo settlers expanded and
improved the road that ran east out of Menard. First it was a gravel road maintained
by the county and later a paved farm-to-market road maintained by the state. But
the modern road passed so close to the old mission that it likely was built along the
route of the original Spanish road that connected the mission to the presidio. The
site was further disturbed as Anglo farmers began to cultivate and irrigate the San
Saba River valley. Eventually, the location became a permanent agricultural field,
obscuring the evidence of the former mission.
Twentieth-century interest in the mission began with a letter of inquiry from
Miss Adina de Zavala, one of the founding members of the Daughters of the Republic
of Texas and dedicated preservationist of Texas history. De Zavala contacted J. J.
Callan in 1901, then Menard County Judge, who provided her with a sketch map
indicating the location of the presidio and the “Presidio Smelter” near the location
of the rediscovered mission. No other advancement was made at that time; however,
these records indicate that the mission location was already lost to the majority of
the residents.
Following de Zavala’s interest, John Warren Hunter, a historically minded
local newspaper editor with a skill for story writing, published a pamphlet titled
“The Rise and Fall of the Mission San Saba” for the 1905 Confederate Veterans’
reunion. Although many of Hunter’s writings are misleading or even incorrect, the
pamphlet would eventually prove to contain valuable information.
The San Sabá stories pick up again in the latter half of the twentieth century
as historians and archeologists searched to find the remains of the lost mission.
Dr. Kathleen Gilmore and Dessamae Lorrain were the first archeologists who tried
to find the mission site, while working at the presidio in the 1960s. Although they
were unsuccessful, Gilmore was instrumental in the future success by determining
that the exact distance between the presidio and the mission site was 3.94 miles.
Two attempts to find the mission were made in the 1980s. The Center for
Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio conducted a oneday search for the mission in 1981 (Hindes and Wolf 1995:4–5; Ivey 1981). This was
followed by an attempt by Bruce Johnson and Tony Weissgarber in 1985 working
for the Texas Old Missions and Forts Restoration Association (Hindes and Wolf
1995:5). When they did not find any Spanish artifacts, they concluded that the site
had been destroyed by agricultural practices. The most intensive survey was led
by Shawn Carlson of Texas A&M University in 1990. This effort also failed to find
the mission site, but the geomorphology study provided important clues regarding
the movements of the San Saba River in historic times.

Chapter 1: Introduction to the Mission San Sabá Project
The site remained elusive until Mark Wolf, a San Antonio architect and
avid historian, became interested in the old mission. Wolf learned that he was a
descendant of Juan Leal, a soldier who survived the 1758 mission attack. He wanted
to know more about the mission site but was surprised to find out that no one knew
exactly where it was. Because of his intense interest in the historical events at San
Sabá, Wolf enlisted the help of historian and archeologist Kay Hindes and Texas
Tech University anthropology professor Dr. Grant Hall to help him find the mission.
Based on archival research and some intuitive detective work, Hindes rediscovered
Hunter’s old 1905 pamphlet indicating that the the “old Hockensmith place” was
the likely location of the mission. This publication had been ignored by other
researchers, but it provided Hindes with a critical clue. After spending some time
examining county deed records, she located the Hockensmith place and traced the
records through time to a property owned by Menard County Judge Otis Lyckman
and his wife Dionitia.
Everything came together on Labor Day weekend in 1993, when Grant Hall,
Mark and Kim Wolf, and Kay Hindes drove out to the Lyckmans’ place. They saw
that the Lyckmans’ field along FM 2092, which was normally covered thick with
alfalfa, had recently been plowed. The group stopped and asked permission to look
around. Within a matter of minutes, they began finding quantities of burned daub,
bone fragments, and Spanish colonial pottery. So it was that, after a barbecue lunch,
they found what had been lost for nearly a century: the site of the 235-year old
mission. But they knew that they would have to do more work to convince others
that this was indeed the mission site.
The next year, Texas Tech University archeologists under the direction of
Dr. Hall undertook intensive archeological investigations at the mission site. These
excavations, in January and May of 1994 and again in the summer of 1997, shifted
away from the idea of having to prove the site was the mission and more toward
archeological research to begin exploring what had once existed there. Extensive
work was done over most of the mission site, but all of the Texas Tech work was
on the privately owned property north of FM 2092. Comprehensive reporting of
all of the Texas Tech investigations at Mission San Sabá has not been completed,
but summaries of the work have been published (Hall 1994, 2001) along with a
preliminary report on the 1993–1994 investigations (Hindes et al. 1995) and an
analysis of cultural materials from the 1997 excavations (McWilliams 2001).
After the Texas Tech investigations in 1997, there was a hiatus of about
a decade. Archeological work began again when the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) planned to expand the rural farm-to-market road that runs
east from Menard down the San Saba River valley. Hired as consultants by TxDOT’s
Archeological Studies Program in 2006, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI), conducted
archeological testing to see if the mission deposits extended into the FM 2092 right
of way. Using mechanical and hand excavations, they discovered Spanish colonial
artifacts and intact features along the north edge of the roadway. The work quickly
transformed into a full-scale data recovery project that extended into 2007. Extensive
hand excavations were completed in a 3-m-wide strip north of the road along the
fence that marks the southern boundary of the Lyckmans’ alfalfa field.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Right after the 2006 fieldwork, PAI prepared a preliminary report and
recommended that the archeological work at Mission San Sabá was sufficient to
mitigate the adverse effects of widening FM 2092. This was followed by consultation
between TxDOT’s Archeological Studies Program and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), who agreed that the archeological data recovery was sufficient
and had salvaged important archeological evidence that would otherwise have been
lost. The FM 2092 road expansion was allowed to proceed, and it was finished soon
after the archeological work was completed.
But the investigations of Mission San Sabá did not end with the completion
of the data recovery fieldwork. As is often the case with archeological projects,
much of the real learning occurred in the laboratory during the analysis phase.
Intermittently from 2007 through 2011, PAI continued studying the artifacts,
examining the photographs and feature maps, and analyzing the data in a variety
of ways. PAI archeologists and many consultants with specialized skills examined
the recovered materials, created inventories and computer databases, and made
maps and profiles to look at horizontal and vertical distributions that might make
sense out of the mass of data. Such work is often tedious, but it is a tried-and-true
method that allows researchers to see meaningful patterns in material culture and
features, ultimately revealing clues about human activities. At Mission San Sabá,
these exercises helped translate archeological data into evidence that was used
to infer where structures once stood, what happened to those structures, and the
various activities that occurred in a small sliver of land along the southern edge of
Mission San Sabá.
This report is about the history and archeology of Mission San Sabá. In
it, we present the methods, results, and interpretations of PAI’s historical and
archeological investigations for the testing and data recovery phases at Mission
San Sabá. From a management perspective, this report presents the archeological
evidence that satisfies part of the requirements specified in Antiquities Permit
Nos. 2192 and 4317 issued by the THC.1 But from a more personal perspective, this
report attempts to flesh out some of the stories of the human events that occurred
at Mission San Sabá, before, during, and after its brief existence as a northern
outpost of the Spanish empire.
MISSION SAN SABÁ: AN ATYPICAL MISSION IN TEXAS
Mission San Sabá was typical in many ways. First, it followed a long-standing
Spanish settlement pattern in which missions and presidios were established as
building blocks for communities. Bolton (1917) defined the mission as a “pioneering
agency,” both politically and socially. After a mission was established, a presidio was
founded for protection. As additional missions were added, civilians were encouraged
to inhabit the surrounding area and supply goods to the settlement (Faulk 1969:10).
This settlement pattern was first used in Mexico and continued as the Spanish
moved northward into Texas—first establishing missions in the El Paso area and
then downstream on the Rio Grande and in east Texas and San Antonio.
Antiquities Permit No. 4192 was issued in July 2006 for the FM 2092 survey and testing of
Mission San Sabá, and Permit No. 4317 was issued in November 2006 for the testing of site
41MN55 and the data recovery investigations at Mission San Sabá.

Chapter 1: Introduction to the Mission San Sabá Project
Second, Apache raids on San Antonio were common throughout the early
eighteenth century, and Mission San Sabá was one of several attempts to pacify
the Apache. Rather than launching military campaigns against the problematic
tribe, missionizing them was suggested as early as 1725 (Dunn 1912:188). In 1743,
Father Santa Ana, head of the San Antonio missions, urged the viceroy to assist in
the conversion of the Apache. His plan was threefold: (1) to pacify Apache and reduce
raids on San Antonio; (2) to build a presidio in their lands to further protect San
Antonio; and (3) to enable searches for valuable minerals in an area the Spanish
recognized was an important mining region (Dunn 1914:188). Father Alonso Giraldo
de Terreros, a veteran of the east Texas missions, established a mission for the Apache
on the Rio Grande in December 1754. Mission San Lorenzo (Milam County), about
5 miles west of the presidio at San Juan Bautista, was successful for only a year
before the Indians revolted and burned the mission. The failure of the first attempt
to missionize the Apache was blamed on their reluctance to live away from their
central Texas homelands. Hence, the plan for a mission in the Apache homeland was
begun—a plan that eventually led to the Mission San Sabá effort. Although that
effort was not successful, the two missions that followed—San Lorenzo de la Santa
Cruz and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria on the Nueces River (Real County)—
lasted nine years in the final attempt to pacify the Apache peoples of Texas.
Mission San Sabá was also typical in that it was a continuation of a northern
push for the Spanish empire. The Spanish had been moving steadily northward since
the establishment of Mexico City in 1520, founding missions on the Rio Grande south
of modern-day Eagle Pass in 1699 and in the El Paso region by 1715. Since the early
seventeenth century, Spain had been establishing missions and settlements in east
Texas and Louisiana specifically to lay claim to the lands and to ward off the French
intrusion from the east. Keeping the French at bay—by hundreds of miles—secured
Spanish interests in Texas. In the later part of the eighteenth century, the motivation
for Spain’s northward expansion evolved into a defensive move to protect its more
southerly settlements from hostile Native tribes.
It is the uniqueness of Mission San Sabá that has been memorialized, even
glorified, in history, however. The San Sabá expedition is unique in several ways.
1. It was not a state-funded endeavor but was privately funded. It was
both geographically and politically isolated.
2. It is the only instance of a Spanish mission in Texas being fully
destroyed, with more than a quarter of its population killed, including
two priests. This destruction resulted not from instability within the
Spanish empire or a lack of planning, but from a dynamic political
power struggle involving the Spanish, the French, and various Native
groups.
3. Two rare sources provide a wealth of information for scholars
researching the mission. The moment of the attack was memorialized
a few years after the event in a painting. Currently, Mission San Sabá
is the only one in Texas for which a founding inventory of supplies is

7

8

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
known to exist. These factors make Mission San Sabá one of the most
fascinating places in the history of Spanish settlement in Texas.
The mission system was a well-founded institution in Spanish colonization.
Typically, a mission endeavor was funded by the royal treasury as the first step in
a colonization effort. However, San Sabá was the only mission enterprise in Texas
to be funded solely by private funds2 (Terreros 2004:617). Don Pedro Romero de
Terreros, a wealthy silver miner and one of the richest men in Mexico, offered to
fund the mission expedition, bear the cost of the construction of three missions3
(Dunn 1914:387), and support the endeavor for three years (Bancroft 1886:626).
Don Pedro de Terreros’s motives were fourfold: philanthropy, access to silver-mining
prospects in central Texas, receiving political rewards in the form of a nobility title,
and receiving dispensation for a court case in which he was involved (Dunn 1914:388).
Of all the eighteenth-century missions in Texas, Mission San Sabá was the
most northerly and geographically isolated. Even more taxing, it was politically
isolated. Many missions were geographically isolated—a result of the fundamental
function of outreach mission posts. But San Sabá sat on the border between the
Spanish empire and many northern Native groups. Although Mission San Sabá was
only ca. 150 miles from San Antonio de Béxar,4 that post did not recognize San Sabá
as its political problem. In fact, none of the governors of Texas, Coahuila, or New
Mexico would claim Mission San Sabá as falling within their jurisdiction. Rather, San
Sabá answered only to the viceroy in Mexico City, nearly 1,000 miles to the south.
This political limbo was costly for Mission San Sabá. For one thing, it meant that
information requests and other communications took about four months (Weddle
1964:61) rather than the few days needed at most missions in Texas. In fact, the
news of the attack on the mission, an event of utmost importance, took 23 days to
reach the viceroy (Dunn 1914:413). The issue of political jurisdiction for the presidio,
the military outpost that remained at San Sabá, was not resolved until seven years
after the fall of the mission. Although the Spanish governor of Texas, Jacinto de
Barrios, held an investigation to prove his claim to the region in November 1756,
the matter was not settled until 1765, when authorities officially decided in favor
of Texas (Dunn 1914:389, note 6).
The destruction of Mission San Sabá is unique in the annals of Texas history
and in much of the New World. Many Spanish missions failed as a result of lack
of food, pestilence, and illness, and others failed at least temporarily due to the
rebellions of the mission Indians. By contrast, Mission San Sabá failed as a result
of a dynamic political situation that had been brewing for many years and involved
multiple groups of Native peoples interacting with Spain and France. One of the
fundamental requirements of the private funding for the San Sabá effort specified
Another example of this type of private support took place in California beginning in 1767
when a collective Jesuit “Pious Fund” led to the establishment of the missions of Lower California
(Bolton 1917:47).
3
Dunn (1914:387, note 17) explains that Bancroft (1886:626) stated “that no more than twenty
missions were to be founded,” but Dunn’s research found no references to a vision of 20 missions.
Bancroft’s comment is an error because all other documents state that only three missions were
planned.

The San Xavier missions in Milam County were also about 150 miles from San Antonio de Bexar.

that it be placed in the Apache lands, commonly called the Apachería. The Spanish
did not fully comprehend the itinerant nature of the Indians’ boundaries, nor did
they understand the aggressive nature of the relationships between the Apache and
the Tejas and their new allies, the Comanche. Much of what the Spanish knew as
the Apachería in the 1740s had become the Comanchería by the 1750s.
As evidence of the rapid changes and cultural chaos in central Texas, Faulk
(1969) cites Barreiro’s 1724–1728 inspection tour map, which depicts the Apache in
west, southwest, and northwest Texas and the Comanche as a small tribe restricted
to New Mexico. The results of a nine-day battle between the two tribes in 1725 on
the Wichita River changed the two nations and their interactions with the Spanish
forever. The Comanche were victorious, pushing the Apache farther southward
and becoming an established menace in the San Antonio region by the 1740s. The
Comanche were first documented in the San Antonio area by 1733, and by 1743 they
came regularly to San Antonio specifically to hunt down their Apache enemies (Faulk
1969:12; de la Teja 1995:13). This rapid southward expansion of Comanche territory
was facilitated by their alliance with the Tejas (Wichita) and their advantageous
relationship with the French. The Comanche quickly became powerful through the
acquisition of guns and horses. They harbored a deep hatred for the Apache, and
the two groups were constantly at war as the Comanche spread out across much
of northern Texas. These factors created a disastrous combination for the Spanish
mission on the San Saba River.
Internal revolts were not uncommon within the Spanish mission system in
Texas. And priests had been killed by Native peoples while serving their missions
before San Sabá. Father José Pita died in Carniceria (near Rockdale) in 1721, and
Father Javier de Silva died near the Rio Grande Presidio in 1749 (Terreros 2004:626).
What is unique about the San Sabá experience is the degree of the destruction that
resulted from the attack. The 11-month-old mission was completely destroyed, and
12 of the 30–35 residents died, including 2 priests assigned to the mission.5 The
martyrdom of 2 priests at one time is unique to Mission San Sabá.
Finally, Mission San Sabá offers historians two unique sources of information:
the 1760s painting commissioned to memorialize the martyred priests and the
1756–1757 founding inventory of supplies. Texas missions have been portrayed
in many paintings over the years, with perhaps dozens of paintings of the Alamo
alone. But the Destruction of San Sabá painting depicting the martyrdom of the
two priests and the events of the attack has been described as “the earliest extant
easel painting by a professional artist depicting an event in Texas history” (Ratcliffe
1991:509). The precision and accuracy of the details portrayed attest to the fact that
the painting not been adequately studied (White 2000:7). As for the rarity of the
founding inventory, the Spanish are well known for their thorough documentation,
and other founding inventories of Texas missions surely existed once. To date,
however, The Inventory of Supplies for the Mission San Sabá is the only founding
inventory that has been discovered and translated.
Hindes estimates the total number of people at the mission as 27–35 (Hindes et al. 1995:6).
Terreros states that 30 people were at the mission and that 12 died in the mission attack (Terreros
2004:626).

REPORT ORGANIZATION
This report is divided into 15 chapters and 6 appendixes. Chapter 2 presents
the mission’s history in more detail. Chapter 3 describes the previous archeological
investigations through the 1990s. Chapter 4 summarizes PAI’s multidisciplinary
research conducted for the current study, including archival research, the translation
of unpublished primary documents, an intensive archeological survey near the
mission, the archeological testing to define the mission area, and the data recovery
investigations of a 3x70-m-long strip within the FM 2092 right of way.
Chapters 5–10 describe the material culture recovered from the mission site.
Chapter 5 presents descriptions of all the artifacts recovered, focusing attention
on those that were definitely and probably associated with the Spanish colonial
occupation. Chapter 6 summarizes Steven Schooler’s 2009 research on the lead
artifacts from the mission in combination with new lead sourcing results from the
PAI investigations. This discussion includes a spatial analysis of Spanish and French
lead. Chapter 7 presents Mark Wolf ’s interpretation of mission architecture based
on his analysis of fired daub. The specific attributes and distributions of fired daub
aid in our interpretation of building construction and the overall layout of the the
mission. Chapter 8 describes the lithic artifacts from the site, which include debitage
and dart points as well as gunflints, strike-a-lights, and a Perdiz arrow point. The
chapter includes a discussion of the distribution and cultural affiliation of various
lithic artifacts. Chapter 9, by Dr. Brian Shaffer, identifies the faunal materials and
examines their distribution with an emphasis on a specific bone concentration
associated with the Perdiz arrow point. Chapter 10, by Dr. Leslie Bush, reviews the
array of wood, wood charcoal, and plant materials collected from PAI excavations
as well as materials collected by Texas Tech’s 1997 field school. Many of the plant
remains are native species that represent structural remains of the mission.
However, two types of non-native pine (hard and soft), Douglas fir, bald cypress,
European chestnut, and an unidentified fragment of nut meat represent botanical
artifacts brought long distances to the mission site by the Spanish.
Chapter 11 describes the cultural features found during the excavations,
and Chapter 12 is an analysis and interpretation of the features and artifacts
discovered by PAI in the FM 2092 right of way relative to the cultural features found
by previous investigators. This evidence provides a more comprehensive view of the
portion of Mission San Sabá investigated by PAI as well as the physical character
of the whole mission complex.
Chapters 13 and 14 introduce two highly informative documents and discuss
their relation to the archeological record. Chapter 13 analyzes an eighteenthcentury painting of the attack and destruction of the mission. This painting has
been underappreciated as a source of information. This chapter reviews the history
of the painting and the motivation for its commission and discusses its accuracy
in comparison with the archeological record. Chapter 14 introduces the Inventory
of Supplies, a document that lists the supplies purchased for the expedition and
operation of the mission. It was written by a priest who oversaw the procurement
of supplies and traveled with the party from Mexico City to the mission site on

Chapter 1: Introduction to the Mission San Sabá Project
the San Saba River. The document lists, item by item, all materials (other than
personal effects) purchased in Mexico City or along the route to the mission. As
such, it is especially informative for interpreting the material culture recovered
from the mission site.
Chapter 15, the final chapter, summarizes some of the findings and highlights
the most significant discoveries and interpretations. Some important conclusions
are reiterated to emphasize future research opportunities that may aid in a better
understanding of the history and physical remains of the Mission San Sabá.
Appendix A is a compendium of references related to the history of Mission
San Sabá. It includes eyewitness accounts by Spanish observers about the mission’s
layout, the surrounding landscape, interactions with the Apache, the dramatic
events that unfolded during the mission attack, and the aftermath of the mission’s
destruction. Appendix B contains the Inventory of Supplies, including a facsimile of
the original handwritten Spanish document, the 1995 Spanish transcription, and the
English translation by Dr. Phil Dennis (1995a, 1995c), as well as the 2011 English
retranslation by Mariah Wade and Jennifer McWilliams completed as part of this
project. This appendix also contains a table of all the material culture itemized in
the Inventory, sorted into functional categories, along with Gilmore’s (1967) English
translation of the list of items salvaged from the Mission San Sabá soon after the
attack (with new translation notes by Mariah Wade). As a final tool to aid future
researchers, Appendix B also contains a glossary of key Spanish terms that appear
in the Inventory and other Spanish colonial documents. Appendix C is an inventory
of cultural materials recovered from PAI’s archeological investigations with artifact
provenience information for all the Spanish colonial artifacts. Appendixes D and E
present detailed provenience information on the faunal and botanical collections,
respectively. Finally, a popular brochure on the history of the Menard Irrigation
Company, which was produced as part of a public outreach effort in 2007 (Prewitt
and Associates, Inc. 2007), is reproduced in Appendix F.

CHAPTER 2: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Jennifer K. McWilliams and Douglas K. Boyd

The history of Mission San Sabá is exciting and violent, and the events that
occurred there changed the course of Texas history forever. To understand why the
Spanish established Mission San Sabá as a remote outpost to Christianize Apaches
on its northern frontier, one must look at the entire history of Spanish settlement in
Texas from the late seventeenth century through the late eighteenth century. During
that time, the Spanish repeatedly felt threatened by French encroachment into
Texas (Wade 2003:135).6 The tension between Spain and France, longtime rivals in
Europe, found its way into the New World in the seventeenth century. There is little
doubt that the French and the Spanish were both interested in settling the lands
along the Gulf of Mexico, and the New World boundary between these two powers
was constantly in flux. The French established a foothold in Texas accidentally when
Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, missed the mouth of the Mississippi River and
landed at Matagorda Bay to establish Fort St. Louis in 1685 (Chipman 1992:70–85).
The Spanish heard the news by the summer of 1685 from captured French sailors
who had been on the voyage with La Salle but were later captured by the Spanish
(Chipman 1992:77). This news shocked the Spanish, and it spurred many expeditions
and four years of searching for the secret French fort. What the Spanish did not know
was that only a handful of the French had survived, and that they had left the fort
in January 1687 (Bruseth and Turner 2005:31). The French settlement would fail
within two years, but the Spanish did not learn of this until Alonso de León finally
found its ruins in April 1689 (Chipman 1992:83).
The interactions between the European powers are important in the Mission
San Sabá story. When the Spanish came to the San Saba River in 1757, 70 years
after the French abandoned Fort St. Louis, the Spanish and French rivalry was still
very real. More importantly, this rivalry played an important role in the pivotal
events that occurred at Mission San Sabá in 1758.
Before delving into the specifics of Mission San Sabá history, some general
background information will be helpful. Presented first is a brief summary of the
key historical sources relating directly to mission history. This is followed by some
thoughts on the importance of the published dates and chronology of Spanish
See Dunn’s Spanish and French Rivalry in the Gulf Region of the United States, 1678–1702: The
Beginnings of Texas and Pensacola. This extensive treatise documents the Spanish exploration of
the Texas coast and details the complexity of the Spanish and French rivalry. Many researchers
emphasize the threat of French incursion along the Texas coast and in Louisiana as a primary
reason for Spain’s intense interest in settling Texas. However, Dunn argues that the missionization
of the Texas Indians weighed more heavily in their decision-making than any actual or perceived
French threat. In contrast, Wade (2003:135) suggests that Spanish efforts to settle in central Texas
were a continuation of the power struggle between France and Spain.

occupation sites in Texas. Next is a discussion of the Spanish conventions for naming
Spanish sites (missions, presidios, ranchos, and villages) to explain some of the
confusion caused by the plethora of Spanish places in Texas. A summary of Spanish
settlement patterns in Texas follows this to provide context for understanding how
and why the mission on the San Saba River came to be established. The final section
containing general background is a historical review of the Spanish mission system
in Texas, including discussions of the division of the northern frontier into Spanish
states and the French threat as an incentive to Spanish settlement.
The next two sections begin to focus on the history that is directly relevant
to the Mission San Sabá story. One section describes the Spanish-Indian relations in
the state, including relations with and between the Apache, Comanche, and Wichita.
It also describes the chaotic cultural situation in central Texas in the mid-eighteenth
century. The next section looks at the Spanish efforts to pacify the Apache Indians
through missionization and the sequence of Apache missions in cental Texas from
1746 to the 1750s, as well as the interplay between Spanish mining and mission
efforts in the region.
The last two sections in this chapter pertain to the history of Mission
San Sabá. One covers the events from the initial funding efforts by Don Pedro de
Terreros through the destruction of the mission at the hands of the Norteños on
March 16, 1758, to the events in the days that followed. The last section considers
the Spanish responses to the attack and the long-term effects of this pivotal
historical event.
NOTES ON MISSION SAN SABÁ SOURCES
The story of Mission San Sabá is detailed in primary sources (original
Spanish documents and the English translations) and secondary publications that
interpret the primary sources. Primary Spanish sources pertaining to Mission San
Sabá that have been published as English translations include: The San Sabá
Papers by Nathan and Simpson (2000);7 Dennis’s (1995b) translation of Revenge
of the San Saba written by Father Trinidad in 1758; selected Spanish documents
found in archives and translated by Wade (2007); Gilmore’s (1967:37–43) listing
of items recovered immediately after the mission attack (see Table B.3); and
an updated translation of the Inventory of Supplies brought for the founding of
Mission San Sabá (see Appendix B). Like all historical information, the original
Spanish documents and the English translations may have their faults, biases, and
inconsistencies, but together they present a vast amount of information regarding
the mission’s establishment, existence, and demise. Unfortunately for researchers
trying to interpret the details of the archeological findings, these documents have few
descriptions of the mission layout, buildings, and features. Secondary sources include
Bonilla’s Brief Compendium of the History of Texas, 1772, published as an annotated

The San Sabá Papers was originally published in 1959 by John Howell Books (Nathan and
Simpson 1959), but a second edition was published in 2000 by Southern Methodist University
Press (Nathan and Simpson 2000), with an added foreword by historian Robert S. Weddle. Except
for the foreword, the pagination of the second edition is the same as the first.

Violent Legacy of the San Sabá Mission details the historical implications of the
mission’s demise. These primary and secondary sources—all used in compiling this
chapter—tell various parts of the mission’s story from different perspectives.
PUBLISHED DATES FOR SPANISH COLONIAL SITES
Understanding the history of Spanish settlement in Texas depends on
knowing the precise dates of occupations of the many missions, presidios, ranchos,
and villages. Anyone who has studied Spanish colonial history or archeology in Texas
knows that it is common to see different dates stated in different publications for the
founding, moving, occupation and reoccupation, and final abandonment of a single
mission or presidio. These discrepancies may stem from many sources. Sometimes
there are errors in the original Spanish documents, and sometimes errors were
introduced by imprecise translations of those documents. In other cases, researchers
have not understood what an original stated date actually signified. Perhaps the
most common source of error is the repetition of an incorrect date once it appears
in a popular secondary publication. For example, the founding dates of a settlement
cited in secondary publications may actually refer to the date when: (a) the location
was first visited and identified for settlement; (b) an expedition set out to establish
the settlement; (c) an expedition arrived to begin building the settlement; or (d) the
first mass was held to dedicate the settlement. Similarly, the abandonment of a
particular mission or presidio may refer to when: (a) an official order was given
for abandonment; (b) most of the people left the location; (c) the last of the people
left the location; (d) some piece of government paperwork was signed making the
abandonment official many months after everyone left; or even (e) someone returned
to camp at a settlement that had been previously abandoned. Clearly, researchers
must use caution when considering the chronology of events and published dates
for key events pertaining to missions, presidios, and settlements.
SPANISH COLONIAL PLACE NAMES IN TEXAS
The history of the Spanish mission system in Texas can be complex and
confusing to modern researchers, and there are two main interrelated sources that
cause much of the confusion. One is the system of complex naming conventions
employed by the Spanish in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the
other is the geographic settlement pattern that emerged as the Spanish empire
expanded into what is now Texas. After a quick look at a map of Spanish colonial
Antonio Bonilla’s Breve compendio de la historia de Texas (1772) (Brief Compendium of Texas
History) is a secondary source translated and published by Elizabeth West (1904). Bonilla used
primary and secondary sources to write his history. However, many of his statements and opinions
are based on sources that are no longer available; thus, parts of his work are considered to be a
primary source (Mariah Wade, personal communication 2011).

sites (missions, presidios, and villages) in the state (Figure 2.1), one is impressed
by the length of the names and bewildered by the duplication of many words and
some complete names. Like most maps of missions and presidios in the state, this
map is not a snapshot in time. Rather, it represents almost a century and a half of
changing settlement locations, a process that spanned from 1690 to 1830.9
The Spanish settlement pattern is discussed in more detail later in this
chapter, but the historical sequence of missions and presidios that sprang up and
disappeared across Texas is indeed a source of confusion. As the Spanish spread
across the northern frontier, they would establish a mission/presidio complex
somewhere out in the frontier, but the effort would typically fail because of the remote
location. They would inevitably abandon the mission/presidio and then pull back,
attempting another mission/presidio settlement in a closer location. Unfortunately
for later historians and archeologists, the Spanish did not retire the name of a
mission/presidio when the effort failed and the location was abandoned. A case in
point is Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga near Goliad, Texas. This mission, named
after La Bahía del Espíritu Santo (the Bay of the Holy Spirit, now Matagorda Bay),
was established in 1722 and moved three times (in 1725, 1726, and 1749). But the
name remained the same in each location even after the mission moved inland
(Hindes et al. 1999:85–86; Walter, Hindes, and Boyd 2005:1–2).
Naming Conventions for Mission Complexes
To understand Spanish colonial history in Texas, it is important to consider
the naming conventions used for missions and presidios in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, as well as how formal and informal names have been used in
the archival documents and in historical and archeological literature. The Spanish
named missions and presidios after saints, rivers, political figures, and Native
peoples, with each place name generally derived by incorporating names from
multiple sources. Part of a mission or presidio name usually came from the saint, or
more specifically the saint’s feast days (St. Patrick’s Day is an example familiar to
most Americans.) Not all mission names in Texas have a saint name included, but
most do. Names starting with San are those of male saints (e.g., San Antonio, San
Marcos, San Lorenzo, San Xavier, and San José) while those starting with Santa
are of female saints. These names generally, but not always, correlate to the day
on which a particular mission, presidio, or settlement was founded. Other Catholic
terms were also used, generally at the beginning of the mission name. Examples are
Nuestra Señora (Our Lady), Nuestro Padre (Our Father), Espíritu Santo (the Holy
Notably, different maps of Spanish colonial places invariably have discrepancies in site locations.
This is often due to guesswork in the plotting of some sites whose locations have not been
confirmed. For example, Mission San Clemente, a temporary mission occupied from March 16
to May 1, 1684, by the Mendoza-Lopez expedition (Standifer 2010), is often depicted in different
places. Connor (1969) believed that the mission was on the San Saba River west of Menard.
Leutenegger and Habig (1973) depict it in the San Angelo area, well north of Mission San Sabá.
More recently, Hays (1998:Figure 63) concluded that the mission site has not been found, and his
research indicates it was somewhere in far western Kimble County near where Copperas Creek
converges with the North Llano River. Because of this uncertainty, the location of Mission San
Clemente is not shown in Figure 2.1.

Spirit), Santa Cruz (Holy Cross), Santísimo Nombre (Holiest Name), La Navidad
(The Christmas), and Apostol (Apostle).
River names were also commonly incorporated into the names, but this can
be confusing because the names of some rivers have changed. For example, the
San Xavier Missions in modern-day Milam County were established on the Rio
San Xavier, which is now called the San Gabriel River. In this case, as in the case
of Mission San Sabá, the river was named for a saint, and the mission was later
named for the river.
Some missions and presidio names include the names of the Native groups
that they served. Nuestro Padre San Francisco de los Tejas in east Texas, the
Adaes missions and presidio in western Louisiana, and Nuestra Señora de la Luz
del Orcoquisac in southeast Texas incorporated Native group identities. Missions
Concepción and San Juan Capistrano in San Antonio were originally located in east
Texas and were formally named Purísima Concepción de los Hainai, for a subgroup
of the Caddo called Hainai (later considered part of the Hasinai Confederation), and
Mission San José de Nazonis, for the Nazonis people.
Some missions were named after political figures. Mission San Antonio
de Valero (now called the Alamo) was named for the Marqués de Valero, who had
recently been appointed viceroy of New Spain. Presidio San Augustín de Ahumada
was the namesake of Agustín Ahumada y Villalón, Marqués de las Amarillas, viceroy
of New Spain during the time of that settlement.
An additional source of confusion is the shortening or nicknaming of missions
or mission complexes. When names are shortened for convenience, the less formal
names can be mistaken for other locations with similar or identical nicknames. The
name Mission San José, for example, could refer to a mission in Texas, New Mexico,
Arizona, California, Florida, or northern Mexico. Further confusion may arise when
clusters of missions and presidios are lumped together under a single informal
name. A cluster of three missions and a presidio along the central portion of the
Rio Grande was commonly called Rio Bravo del Norte or Rio Grande del Norte by
the Spanish. These were some of the earliest Spanish settlements along the Texas
border, beginning in 1699, and they consist of the missions San Juan Bautista,
San Francisco Solano, and San Bernardo, and Presidio San Juan Bautista del Rio
Grande del Norte. These were dubbed the gateway missions because almost all of
the future Spanish envoys went through this entry into modern-day Texas (Chipman
1992:107; Eaton 1989). It is accurate to use the collective names for the settlement,
whether in Spanish or English, but it is sometimes unclear whether a researcher
is referring to the settlement, a particular mission within the settlement, or even
the general geographic region.
Sometimes a name was transferred to a different mission altogether. The San
Xavier Missions settlement existed from 1746 to 1755 on the San Xavier River (San
Gabriel). Not long after it was abandoned, two other missions were established much
farther west, along the upper Nueces River. These missions, which operated from
1762 to 1771, were referred to as the El Cañon Missions. Confusion arises because
the name of one of the San Xavier missions, Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, was

Chapter 2: Historical Background
transferred to one of the El Cañon missions, Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria del
Cañon (Bolton 1915:94; Chipman 1992:175–176, 2010a, 2010b; Gilmore 2010a;
Supplee 2010).
One of the longest mission names, Nuestra Señora de la Bahía del Espíritu
Santo de Zúñiga is, not surprisingly, often shortened to either Espíritu Santo or
more commonly La Bahía. Mission La Bahía is often lumped together with two other
missions in Refugio County—Nuestra Señora del Rosario and Nuestra Señora del
Refugio. Located some 27 miles apart, these three sites are collectively called the
La Bahía missions. As mentioned earlier, a great deal of confusion has been caused
by the fact that Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga was moved several times, with
slight name changes, and many historical references use only shortened versions
of the mission’s name (see Hindes et al. 1999:85–86).
The most extreme example of changing a mission name is the Alamo, a
popular tourist destination in San Antonio. The Mission San Antonio de Valero
(originally referred to as San Antonio de Padua) was established in 1718 and
abandoned in 1793. The old mission buildings were used to house Spanish soldiers
in the early nineteenth century, and it became the location of the famous 1836 battle
for Texas independence. Some historians believe that the name Alamo came from
a nearby a grove of cottonwood trees (Williams 2010).
The Many Names of San Sabá Mission and Presidio
The mission and presidio on the San Saba River are good examples of the
use of multiple naming conventions. The mission’s name, Santa Cruz de San Sabá,
translates as “The Holy Cross of the San Saba.” It was named for a holy cross and
a saint, although there are different ideas about the exact origins of this name.
In this case, historical evidence indicates that the river was named first and the
mission was named later.
Although researchers believe that the Spanish first crossed the San Saba
River during the Mendoza-Lopez expedition of 1683–1684 (Hindes et al. 1995:5;
Weddle 1964:13), the river was not named until more than 50 years later. Don Juan
Antonio Bustillo y Zevallos, governor of Tejas at the time, is credited with naming
the San Saba River during a 1732 military campaign against the Apaches (Dunn
1912:187; Newcomb 1969:154–156; Weddle 1964:13–15). The expedition reached the
river on December 5, 1732. Having learned that the Indians called the river Las
Nueces, Bustillo named it El Río San Sabá de las Nueces to commemorate the feast
day for St. Sabbás.10 Wade (2003:174) and others are fairly certain that the river
where this occurred was the San Saba. Hackett and Shelby (1934:98–99) attribute
the river naming to the fifth-century abbot St. Sabbás11 (Weddle 1964:13, note 8).

In early writings regarding the river, the mission, or the presidio, the name is spelled in various
ways, including Sabbás, Sabás, Savás, and Sava.
11
Weddle (1964:13, note 8) states that Z. T. Fulmore (1935:25) believed that the San Saba River
was named for Holy Saturday (San Sábado). Weddle points out that the Bustillo battle on
December 9, 1732, was fought on a Saturday, but that the river was probably named four days
earlier on December 5.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
While the latter part of the mission’s name is derived from St. Sabbás, the
Santa Cruz portion of the name is derived from an incident that occurred in 1753.
A small party led by Lieutenant Juan Galván, from the Presidio de San Antonio de
Béxar, and Father Miguel de Aranda were sent to locate a suitable site for an Apache
mission. After exploring the Pedernales and Llano Rivers, they chose a location on
the San Saba River, where they erected a cross and held a religious service in the
presence of Lipan Apache, hoping for a future mission at this location. According to
the historical marker for the Paseo de la Santa Cruz (Holy Cross Ford), which is in
the town of Menard, both the ford in the river and the mission were named for the
cross erected by the Galván expedition (Awbrey et al. 1992:310).
The presidio on the San Saba River, established in 1757 to protect the
mission, was originally christened San Luis de las Amarillas. The first part of the
name refers to a saint that has not been identified in any of the published sources.
The latter part of the name honored the viceroy of New Spain, the Marqués de las
Amarillas. After the mission was destroyed in 1758, the presidio was fortified with
rock walls and operated for another 10 years under a new name, Real Presidio San
Sabá (Walter et al. 2003:3). The new name reverted back to the river named after
St. Sabbás, but it also paid tribute to the memory of the fallen mission. Perhaps the
term Real (Royal) was added to clarify that the presidio was now solely supported
by the crown.
SPANISH SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN TEXAS
Soon after the Spanish arrived off the coast of what is now Veracruz in 1519,
they conquered the Aztecs in Mexico City and began to spread outward in a radiating
pattern. In addition to civilian settlements, they founded complexes of missions
and presidios, or forts. Missions were frontier agencies of Spain and the Catholic
church, but were supported by the Spanish crown to serve its purposes (Bolton
1915:10). From the Spanish crown’s point of view, the functions of the missions were
to pacify the Native inhabitants and encourage them to be productive subjects to
the king of Spain by “extending, holding, Christianizing, and civilizing the frontiers”
(Bolton 1915:10). The church, on the other hand, hoped to spread Catholic faith to
the Native populations.
Missions were intended to serve as temporary facilities. “In the theory of the
law, within ten years each mission was to be turned over to the secular clergy and
the common lands distributed among the Indians.12 But this law was based upon
experience with the civilized Natives of central Mexico and of Peru; on the northern
frontier, among the barbarian tribes, a longer period of tutelage was always found
necessary” (Bolton 1915:12). The function of the presidios was to protect the missions
and support their cause. Presidios were not always necessary; in some cases they
were only established temporarily until the mission was deemed safe and self-reliant.
As in Mexico 100 years before, the radiating settlement pattern appeared
repeatedly as the Spanish settled the modern state of Texas in the eighteenth
This process was called “secularization.” It involved the official transfer of a mission to ordinary
Spanish society and the privatization of the mission’s communal properties. Church functions
were also transferred from the missionary religious orders to a Catholic diocese.

Chapter 2: Historical Background
century. Their primary goal was to defend their expanding territory—first on the
Rio Grande, and later in San Antonio. But each time they expanded, they found
that the distance was too far and their communication and support networks were
overextended. The response was to retreat southward to the comfort and safety
of the established settlements, and then try to establish new settlements closer.
This pattern of overshooting, retreating back to safety, and repeating continued
throughout the eighteenth century, and it eventually led to the establishment of
the Mission San Sabá.
As the Spanish began their northward expansion across the Rio Grande into
Texas, they encountered Native cultures that were not easily pacified as well as
some hostile groups that possessed weapons as advanced as their own. The French
presence in Louisiana forced the Spanish to protect their eastern boundary, and the
Spanish response was to establish missions on the central-eastern border, such as
San Francisco de los Tejas and Santísimo Nombre de Maria around 1690 (Chipman
1992:93, 97, 99, 113; Handbook of Texas Online 2010a; Weddle 2010a, 2010b). But
the threat of hostile Indians combined with poor living conditions, exacerbated by
the long distance to their stronghold on the Rio Grande, forced the Spanish back
in the fall of 1693 (Chipman 1992:93, 97, 99, 113). The Spanish had expanded from
the Rio Grande to the modern-day Louisiana border, a distance of over 400 miles,
partially based on fear of French encroachment along the coast. But as Chipman
(1992:99) notes, “The difficulties of sustaining missions in East Texas had proved
overwhelming.”
The Spanish abandonment of east Texas was short-lived, however. About the
same time they were establishing themselves in the San Antonio area, the Spanish
turned their sights back to east Texas. In 1717, they returned to San Francisco and
renamed the mission Nuestro Padre San Francisco de los Tejas. They also established
Mission San Miguel de Linares de los Adaes (near present-day Robeline, Louisiana)
and Presidio Nuestra Señora del Pilar (Chipman 1992:97, 99, 113, 115; Chipman
2010d; McCorkle 2010). Back in the Old World, Spain entered a short war with
several European powers, including France. The hostilities spilled over into the
New World when the French attacked Mission Los Adaes in 1719. This ultimately
caused the Spanish to again abandon the east Texas missions and head back to San
Antonio (Chipman 1992:118–119).
Spain and France reached a truce in their European engagement, and by
1721, the Spanish were moving back to reestablish the six missions in east Texas
(Chipman 1992:121–123). In 1722, the Spanish moved southward toward the coast
and established Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto “at the precise location of La
Salle’s Fort St. Louis.” This presidio was built to ensure that the French did not
return to Texas. They also established the nearby mission called Nuestra Señora
del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga (Chipman 1992:124–126; Roell 2010a). The mission
and presidio would be the first of several locations known by the same name but
commonly called La Bahía (Roell 2010a, 2010b).
In the mid-eighteenth century the Spanish tried again to extend their reach
farther into central Texas, but this time they ventured only 150 miles northeast of

21

22

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
San Antonio. Between 1746 and 1749, they established the three San Xavier Missions
near the modern town of Rockdale in Milam County.13 Again, this settlement was
unsuccessful, and the San Xavier missions were abandoned in 1755. The party
withdrew and moved one of the missions to modern New Braunfels and then to
modern San Marcos one year later (Chipman 1992:150; Gilmore 2010a; Supplee
2010).
The next year in 1757, the Spanish tried again, moving into north-central
Texas to establish Mission and Presidio San Sabá. This was the farthest north the
Spanish ever reached in central Texas. However, the San Sabá Mission was destroyed
in less than one year, resulting in a change in Spain’s policy on northward expansion
and, indeed, the entire course of Texas history. After this mission attempt failed in
1758, they moved south and west to Camp Wood, in modern Real County, establishing
the El Cañon missions. But this effort also failed by 1771. The great distances from
San Antonio, coupled with harsh wilderness conditions and unwilling or hostile
Indians, worked against the Spanish in their efforts to settle in central Texas.
THE SPANISH MISSION SYSTEM IN TEXAS
As noted earlier, the Spanish crown envisioned the mission system as a means
of pacifying the Native inhabitants and molding them into a productive workforce
(Bolton 1917:43, 46; Fox 1983:79). For the Catholic church, however, converting
the Indians to Catholicism and saving souls were the primary motivation. Since
the funding for most mission efforts came from the Spanish treasury, Catholic
missionaries served both roles and attempted to please both the church and the
crown (Bolton 1915:10). Religious colleges were established in New Spain to train
missionaries to fulfill these goals.
In 1683, the first Franciscan College, Colégio Propaganda Fide de la Santa
Cruz de Querétaro, was established. It was from this college that Father Terreros,
father president of the San Sabá Mission, came. Two other colleges, Nuestra Señora
de Guadalupe de Zacatecas and San Fernando de Méjico, opened a few years later
(Castañeda 1936:3:18–21). The College of San Fernando provided two of the four
original priests who accompanied Father Terreros to the Mission San Sabá.
When establishing new missions, it was customary to relocate previously
converted Native Americans, called neophytes, to the new mission location (Bolton
1917:54). These individuals and families aided in the conversion of the Native groups
near the newly established missions. One group in particular, the Tlaxcaltecans of
central Mexico, gained the trust of the Spanish through their role in the conquest of
the Valley of Mexico, and they became an important mediator in the establishment
of Spanish rule among other Native groups (Gibson 1952). As other lands were
conquered, the Tlaxcaltecans were brought in to teach loyalty and the elements of
civilization to the newly conquered tribes (Bolton 1917:55; Gibson 1952). A group
of Tlaxcaltecan neophytes accompanied the missionaries to establish the mission
called Santa Cruz de San Sabá.
Kathleen Gilmore (1969) found one of the San Xavier mission sites in the 1960s. More recently,
the Texas Historical Commission (2009) investigated three archeological sites believed to represent
the three San Xavier missions (41MM16, 41MM17, and 41MM18).
13

Chapter 2: Historical Background
Presidios also played a key role in the mission system as it expanded into
Texas. While these military outposts were created to protect the missions, they
also encouraged settlement. Soldiers brought their families to live in the presidios,
and these families would grow and later be placed in settlements to populate the
new land. Because of this, Bolton (1917:43) referred to the mission system as a
“pioneering agency.” The combination of the colleges, missions, neophytes, and
presidios contributed to the advancement of the mission system throughout Mexico
and in Texas. The settlement of the northern frontier via the mission system was
always a balancing act between competing motives and goals. This was clearly the
case for Mission San Sabá, where the often contradictory interests of the Spanish
crown, the private financier, the military, and the Catholic church all came into play.
Spain had many motives for settling the New World, but the role of the
Catholic church in the Spanish expansion across Texas was key. The desire to save
souls and spread Christian civilization was strong indeed, and sometimes even
miracles were seen as proof of the worthiness of this goal. A case in point is the story
of the Blue Nun. In the 1620s, the Jumanos (or Tejas) Indians came to the Spanish
with stories of the legendary “Lady in Blue.” She was identified as Madre María de
Ágreda, a Franciscan nun who was believed to have visited the New World through
miraculous bilocation14 (Bolton 1912:8; Calvert and de Leon 1996:16; Castañeda
1936:1, 3, 21, 195–200; Chipman 1992:61–62; Dunn 1917:107). This Christian
miracle was seen as proof of the Indians’ desire to receive religious instruction,
and it greatly encouraged the Catholic church to expand its missionary services
into Texas (Chipman 1992:61–62; Hickerson 1994:88–94). Whatever its origins, the
story of the Blue Nun had a significant impact on the desire to establish missions
among the Native peoples in Texas.
It is certain that the priests who came to establish the Apache missions on the
San Saba River were aware of the story of the Blue Nun. The Inventory of Supplies
shows that they purchased (for 20 pesos in Mexico City) a three-volume set of books
called The Mystical City of God (see Appendix B, Table B.1, line 221). Written in the
seventeenth century by the Franciscan nun María de Ágreda, the book describes
her out-of-body visits to Native Americans in Texas (Madres Concepcionistas de
Ágreda 2012).
Spanish States in Modern-Day Texas
The Spanish governmental organization of its northern province helps
explain some of the administrative problems faced by the remote missions. The
viceroyalty of New Spain included several provinces, one of which was the Spanish
state of Tejas or Texas (Figure 2.2). The mission period in Texas began with the
establishment of visitas (temporary mission) and missions along the Rio Grande
in 1699. Spain’s presence in modern-day Texas continued (intermittently) until
Mexican independence in 1821. In 1772–1773, the few remaining missions were
passed from the College of Querétaro, which had controlled the majority of the
missions since the earliest efforts in Texas, to the College of Zacatecas (Chipman
An extensive description of the Tejas Indians’ knowledge of María de Ágreda, as well as Father
Benevides’s contact with the nun in 1630, can be found in Dunn (1917:106–107).

1992:201). This resulted in the ultimate demise of the missions, as well as drops
in neophyte populations. By 1793, secularization of Valero was ordered, and San
Juan Capistrano and San Francisco de la Espada were closed. Concepción and San
José were partially secularized. Mission Rosario was initially unaffected by the
secularization; it combined with Refugio in 1807 and was finally ordered secularized
in 1828, a move put into effect in 1831 (Chipman 1992:201; Gilmore 2010b). Mission

Chapter 2: Historical Background
Originally, the Spanish called the central and eastern sections of what is now
Texas by the names Tejas, Nueva Filipinas, or the New Kingdom of the Philippines
(Chipman 1992, xi). This area included all lands north and east of the Medina River.
New Spain also controlled lands in the El Paso area under the jurisdiction of New
Mexico.
During the mission period, provincial borders changed frequently (Bolton
1912:1–2; Chipman 1992:xi). From 1694 to 1715, south Texas and part of central
Texas were within the northern province of New Spain, in the state of Coahuila.
The area between the Río Grande and the Concho River, called La Junta de los
Ríos, was in the province of Nueva Vizcaya. Finally, the coastal region from the
Nueces River south to the Río Grande (Río Bravo del Norte) and northward
to Laredo was called Nuevo Santander after 1749 (Chipman 1992:xi). Bolton
(1912:1) states, “With the founding of the province of Nuevo Santander, in 1746,
the western boundary of Texas was officially fixed at the lower Medina River, and
a question frequently debated in the middle of the century was whether the San
Sabá district belonged to Texas, Coahuila, or New Mexico.” Mission San Sabá fell
in this disputed zone, an issue that caused political uncertainty and strife. In
fact, this was one of the major dilemmas that led to the downfall of the endeavor.
Bolton (1912:1) continued, “Later in the century the Nueces River, in part of its
extent, came to be regarded as the boundary” between Coahuila and Tejas. Dunn
(1914:389) gives a date of 1765 for this.
Spanish Expansion into Texas
The Spanish first pushed northward across the Río Grande into modernday Texas through military campaigns against unruly Indian tribes. The first
written record of the Spanish having crossed the Río Grande occurred during a
1655 campaign against the Cacaxtles, who occupied the lands roughly 200 miles
north of Monterrey (Bolton 1912:14–16). This date marks the beginning of Spanish
endeavors in modern-day south Texas. Provincial (basic) missionary work began in
this northern Coahuila region in 1670. Father Juan Larios attempted to converse
with tribes across the Río Grande. As a result of his encounters in 1675, plans were
made for future missions north of the Río Grande (Bolton 1912:15–16). Spain’s next
mission settlement efforts in Texas were made in direct response to threats from
their European rival, France.
The French Threat and Spanish Settlement in East Texas
While most historians think that Fort St. Louis and other French settlements
in Louisiana were the catalyst that prompted Spanish settlement into east Texas
(Bolton 1915; Chipman 1992; Graham 1998), Bolton (1912) and Dunn (1911, 1912,
1914) maintain that French incursions were only one of many motives for Spain’s
northward and eastward expansion. According to the two authors, one argument is
that the Spanish needed a shorter route between their two strongholds of Havana,
Cuba, and New Mexico. A mission at the Bay of Espíritu Santo (modern Matagorda
Bay) would have been an ideal location for an intermediate post (Bolton 1912:18;
Chipman 1992:88; Dunn 1911:200). Rather than believe that the Spanish made

25

26

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
an knee-jerk reaction to French settlement, Dunn and Bolton recognized that the
Franciscans had been making plans to reach the Tejas Indians long before the
French established Fort St. Louis in 1685 (Bolton 1912:24–26; Dunn 1914:380;
Weddle 1964:22). But it appears that the French intrusion was timely indeed, and
the Catholic church used this incident to gain political backing for its missionary
efforts from the Spanish crown.
The Catholic church made its first major push into is now northeast Texas
in the last decade of the seventeenth century in direct response to the news of
the French settlement. In 1690, they established two missions—San Francisco
de los Tejas (also called Nuestro Padre San Francisco de los Tejas) and Santísimo
Nombre de Maria—among the Hasinai on the Neches River. But these missions
were short-lived, and both were abandoned by 1694 (Chipman 1992:93, 97, 99, 113;
Corbin 1989:269–270; Handbook of Texas Online 2010a; Weddle 2010a, 2010b).
After about a decade, the Spanish made a second attempt to gain a foothold among
the Tejas. The Los Adaes Mission and Presidio (Mission San Miguel de Linares de
los Adaes and Presidio Nuestra Señora del Pilar) were founded in 1717, only to be
abandoned two years later due to threats from the French in Louisiana (Chipman
1992:118–119; McCorkle 2010). The presidio and mission complex founded in
San Antonio in 1718 began to flourish in the 1720s, and it served as a hub for
all subsequent religious and military excursions to the north and east. However,
Los Adaes was reestablished in 1721, and it was ultimately designated as capital
of the province of Tejas in 1729 (Chipman 1992:123; McCorkle 2010). But again,
the east Texas missions were destined for failure. By 1729–1730, most of the east
Texas mission personnel were moved to the then-expanding community at San
Antonio (Corbin 1989:270).
Following Corbin (1989), Graham (1998:40) gives three main reasons that
the east Texas missions failed. First, the Caddo, who were involved with the French
trade, had economic clout beyond their relationship with the Spanish. Second, the
Caddo were a poor military target due to their “dispersed pattern of residence, an
adaptation to an environment of patchy resources.” And third, the missions were
poorly situated because the Spanish appear to have selected “sites based on defense
rather than cultivation.” The latter fact resulted in food shortages for the friars
themselves, much less having enough food to attract the Indians. Corbin (1989:270)
also notes how unsuccessful the overall effort was by stating: “The Caddos had every
reason to fear the proselytizing of the Spanish padres, and resisted it to the point
that (as far as records show) none were Christianized during the Spanish sojourn
except in articulo mortis” (at the point of death).
Los Adaes remained as an isolated military post in east Texas from 1730
until 1763, when the remaining populations were forced to move to San Antonio
as well. Coinciding with this move, the French ceded Louisiana to Spain in 1762,
and the capital was moved from Los Adaes to San Antonio de Béxar in 1773. San
Antonio remained the Spanish capital of Texas until Mexico gained independence
from Spain in 1821 (Chipman 1992:123, 186–188; Corbin 1989:270, 2010).

Chapter 2: Historical Background
Spanish Settlement in Central and Coastal Texas, 1718–1740s
San Antonio, located along the Balcones Escarpment at the southeast end
of the central Texas Hill Country, became the hub of Spanish Texas in the second
quarter of the eighteenth century. The Spanish established five operating missions
and one presidio there between 1718 and 1731, along with the civilian community
of Villa San Fernando (Chipman 1992:127–146; Cruz 2010a; de la Teja 1995:47–48,
139–156). By 1731, a separate civilian government was established, and the entire
settlement became known as San Antonio de Béxar (de la Teja 1995:139). San
Antonio was the focal point of most Spanish activity in central Texas, with its larger
mission system supported by outlying ranchos such as Rancho de Las Cabras (Fox
1989; Hester 1989a:200). As the central hub, it was the launching point for more
attempts to expand the Spanish mission system east and north beginning about
1746. Despite its political and geographic importance, San Antonio was plagued
by problems throughout the first half of the eighteenth century, not the least of
which was the constant threat of Indian attacks (Chipman 1992:127–146; de la
Teja 1995:3–13; Wade 2003:159–181). As discussed later in this chapter, repeated
attacks on San Antonio mission settlements would become an important factor in
decisions leading up to Mission San Sabá.
Soon after the first mission was established in San Antonio, other mission
efforts began in the area between San Antonio and the Texas coast. Nuestra Señora
Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga and Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto were
established in 1722 at the site of the old French post of Fort St. Louis. The mission
and presidio were moved several times, ending up in 1726 on the Guadalupe River
in Mission Valley, and then at La Bahía on the Medina River in 1749 (Chipman
1992:124–126; Roell 2010b; Walter 2007:12–13). The Espíritu Santo mission in
Mission Valley (1726–1749) served Native groups in the coastal plains, particularly
the Aranama and Tamique, and perhaps some Coahuiltecan and Karankawa. Walter
(2007:15–19, 191, 196) discusses the complex issues relating to the identity of the
mission Indians at Espíritu Santo. More missions were established southeast and
northeast of San Antonio in the 1750s. These included Mission Rosario in 1754
(Gilmore 1974a, 1974b) and the group of missions and a presidio at San Marcos.
In the period from 1746 to 1755, the Spanish were preoccupied with many
issues on several fronts. They were still worried about the French in east Texas
and were hearing rumors of their presence on the Red River. The Spanish were
became increasingly concerned with efforts to missionize and pacify the Apache and
other central Texas Natives, and they were becoming concerned with new Native
groups—especially the Comanche and Wichita—that were appearing on the scene.
The 1746–1755 period in central Texas is discussed later in this chapter because
the events set the stage for the founding and destruction of Mission San Sabá.
SPANISH–INDIAN RELATIONS IN TEXAS
In central Texas, the interactions between the Spanish and the Native
tribes were complicated and dynamic. They included the ever-shifting friend or
foe relationships between the Spanish and various Apache peoples; the violent

27

28

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
and unrelenting warfare between the Apache and Comanche; and the trading
relationships that evolved between the Comanche, Wichita, and French. These
large-scale political relationships were interlaced with complicated interpersonal
relationships between Spanish soldiers, missionaries, and the Indians they served.
In large part, the Indian attack on the Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá on March
16, 1758, can be explained as an inevitable consequence of the complex cultural,
political, and personal relationships within the borders of Texas.15
Apache
The Spanish relationship with the Apache was plagued by long-term
problems and hostilities relieved by short periods of tranquility. Apache raids on
Spanish expeditions in New Mexico were recorded as early as 1590 (Worcester 1941,
1945a, 1945b). Spanish fears of the Apache are expressed repeatedly in the written
record. Father Bernal described the troubles that the Apache were causing in New
Mexico almost 80 years after that first raid:
The whole land is at war with the widespread heathen nation of
Apache Indians, who kill all the Christian Indians they can find
and encounter. No road is safe; everyone travels at risk of his life,
for the heathens traverse them all, being courageous and brave,
they hurl themselves at danger like people who know no God nor
that there is any hell. New Mexico, 1669. (Worcester 1941:34)
Early in their relationship, the Spanish recognized the strategic advantages
held by their enemy. The Apache were a notoriously mobile tribe, comprised of many
different subgroups or bands with the Lipan Apache being recognized in central
Texas. Their mobility made them difficult to locate and surround. They were also
great horsemen, a skill that the Spanish were not used to competing against in
previous conquests (Worcester 1941:6, 11). The Apache quickly acquired horses and
learned equestrian skills after several thousand horses were brought over from
Spain when the Spanish settled Sante Fé (Weddle 1964:11). The horse enabled the
Apache to be more mobile and raid freely, which became a principal activity among
the tribe. The Apache were described as “professional beggars” who acted only to
“secure enough food to sustain their lazy bodies” (Dunn 1912:200). The historic record
indicates the Spanish regarded the Apache tribes as untrustworthy, capricious, and
deceitful. The founding father of the Mission San Sabá even declared the Apaches’
friendliness “with reservations” only weeks before the mission was established
(Dunn 1914:392).
As early as 1590, the Apache were reported to attack settlements with the
intent of obtaining booty, and their raids were often geared more toward plunder
than killing (Faulk 1969:11; Wade 2003:171; Worcester 1941:6). Even their basic food
economy entailed, in addition to hunting, gaining food from plunder (Matz 1998:17).
But the Apache were also feared and were considered to be violent, bellicose, and
repulsive.
Historian W. W. Newcomb (1969:150) eloquently describes the Native American political
structure during the mission period. The Spaniards, who regularly referred to Indian groups as
“tribes,” were in most cases interacting with individual bands. Named for their leaders (an added
point of confusion for the Spanish recorders), these Native bands historically formed around a
nucleus of extended families.
15

Chapter 2: Historical Background
In Texas, the poor relationship with the Apache began as soon as the Spanish
cultivated a relationship with the Tejas Indians in the east Texas missions.16 The
Spanish did not understand that the very act of befriending the Tejas would prevent
a future friendship with the Apache (Castañeda 1936:3:340; Dunn 1914:380; Weddle
1964:10). The hostile relationship between the Apache and Tejas tribes, including
the Wichita and their Comanche allies, continued until the 1758 attack on Mission
San Sabá (Weddle 1964:55).
The Spanish documents summarized by Wade (2003:159–811) show that
the Apache were a constant threat to the Spaniards in Texas from 1700 to 1755.
“As soon as the Spanish settled on the San Antonio River, Apache groups began to
harass the settlement” (Wade 2003:161). Stories of Apaches mutilating the bodies
of their victims added to the Spaniards’ fear and hatred (Nathan and Simpson
1959:56; Wade 2003:175; Weddle 1964:12). On the other hand, the Spanish retaliated
with military expeditions to hunt the Apaches, often accompanied by many Native
peoples who were enemies of the Apache (Wade 2003:171–176). As much as for
revenge, the Spanish raided Apache settlements specifically to capture hostages
for negotiation purposes and to obtain slaves (de la Teja 1995:123; Wade 2003:163,
171–177). Enslaving Apaches captured in military expeditions “provided a labor
force for the settlers who could not use the mission Natives,” and this “policy would
brand the Spanish–Apache relations forever” (Wade 2003:171–172).
By the mid-eighteenth century, the total number of Apache in Texas was
probably only a fraction of what it had been a century before. For the Apache in
central Texas, “life had been so disrupted that most bands were composites, that is
made up of remnants of several bands or families, even including Apaches who were
not Lipan” (Newcomb 1969:150). Spanish missionaries estimated the total population
to be 3,000 to 5,000 in the vicinity of Missions San Lorenzo and Candelaria, and
Newcomb (1969:150) suggests there were 12 bands with an average of 250–417
people per band.
Comanche
While the Spanish were wary of the Apache from the start, they were totally
unprepared for the threat from the Comanche. Sometime before 1700, the Comanche
had moved out of the Great Basin region and into the Plains of eastern Colorado
and western Kansas. When the Comanche first appeared in northern New Mexico
about 1705, the Spanish were ill-equipped to deal with them. The Comanche were
more aggressive than many Native peoples the Spanish encountered, and they were
well on their way to becoming a powerful equestrian nation. By the middle of the
eighteenth century, their territory had expanded to include a large portion of the
southern Plains, and they had pushed the Apache and other groups entirely out of
the northern portions of Texas. The Comanche and Apache were constantly at war
with each other. While they commonly raided Spanish settlements and mission
pueblos in New Mexico, the Comanche also made regular raids into Texas. Although
the Spanish generally recognized the Comanche as only one tribal group, there were
In this context, Tejas (or Teyas) is used as a collective term for all Caddoan-speaking peoples,
including the Caddo and the Wichita (see Wade 2003:159).
16

actually a dozen or more distinct bands at one time (Bolton 1915:66–69; Gwynne
2010:59; Kessell 1979:370–378; Newcomb 1961:156–158).
Relative to other Native peoples in the northern frontier in the mideighteenth century, the Spanish were more perplexed by the Comanche than any
other group. They were surprised by their horsemanship and military skills and
the speed at which the Comanche came to dominate the region. As discussed below,
the Comanche alliance with the Caddoan-speaking Wichita allowed them to tap
into the French trade, a fact that would have dire consequences for their enemies,
Apache and Spaniards alike.
Wichita (Taovaya)
Entering Texas around 1700, the semisedentary Wichita consisted of four
subgroups: the Taovaya, Tawakoni, Waco, and Kichai (Newcomb 1961:23, 248–249).
While their territory extended as far south as Waco, their eighteenth-century
homeland was centered on the Red River downstream from Wichita Falls, Texas.
Linguistically and culturally, the Wichita were related to the Caddo, but after they
adopted the horse in the eighteenth century, “their culture became increasingly
Plains-like” (Newcomb 1961:23). Of the four subgroups, the Taovaya were the most
intimately involved with the San Sabá affair.
The Wichita were pushed southward in the seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries by the Osages, who were already equipped with European firearms. At the
same time, the Comanche also pushed the Wichita southward, where the Wichita
began acquiring horses from southwestern New Mexico. This resulted in a twoprong benefit for the Wichita: it exposed them to new lands to the south, and it also
gave them a leg up on their rivals by acquiring horses. However, their previously
scattered villages were vulnerable, and their enemies (Osage and Comanche) forced
them into consolidated villages along the Red River (Newcomb 1961:248–249). This
consolidation would ultimately be a benefit that would strengthen the Wichita by
the middle of the eighteenth century.
Comanche-Wichita Alliance
The Spanish ambitions in the northern frontier would ultimately be
challenged by one of the most important events in Texas history: the ComancheWichita alliance formed in 1747 through negotiations by French traders who sought
to trade firearms with the Indians (Newcomb 1961:23, 249; Weddle 2007:3). This
was quickly followed by “a substantial [Wichita] settlement and trading post on
the Red River.…Their principal village was inhabited by the subtribe known as
the Taovayas, the lesser village by the Wichita proper” (Newcomb 1961:249). While
both of these tribes were already becoming formidable foes by themselves, the
1747 alliance solidified their dominance of the southern Plains. But in the 1750s
the Spanish still had no idea just how powerful these enemies had become because
they had not yet engaged them in battle. Use of the horse, combined with French
weapons “set in motion a virtual revolution on the Plains” (Harper 1953a:270) and
“accelerated and gave direction to the reorientation of Indian lifeways already at
work” (Weddle 2007:3).

Chapter 2: Historical Background
“When the Spaniards became reacquainted with the Wichitas in the
eighteenth century, they termed them the Taovayas, after the most important
subtribal village on the Red River. Sometimes, however, they merely referred to
Wichita as Norteños (Peoples or Nations of the North), and the Spaniards in New
Mexico persisted in calling them Jumanos” (Newcomb 1961:248–249). Weddle
(2007) provides one the most complete descriptions of the Taovayas in his lengthy
discussion of Ortiz Parrilla’s 1759 retaliatory campaign in retribution for their role
in the attack on Mission San Sabá (also see Harper 1953a, 1953b, 1953c).
The Comanche and Taovaya were relative newcomers to Texas in the mideighteenth century, but they quickly became powerful adversaries through their
trade alliance with the French. They were not only aggressive toward the Spanish but
were enemies of many other Native groups in the southern Plains. These northern
tribes, or Norteños, played an important role in the events that occurred along the
San Saba River in 1757–1758. Before the 1758 attack on Mission San Sabá, the
Spanish had already become acquainted with the Comanche nation, but Weddle
(2007:2) notes that they “had scarcely any prior notice” of the Taovaya peoples.
The Spanish were caught totally off guard by the military power of these northern
groups. “Naively if not blindly, the Spaniards had entered a sphere of which they
had little understanding” (Weddle 2007:3). Militarily, the Spanish could no longer
assume they were more powerful than the Natives in Texas.
Cultural Chaos among the Central Texas Native Groups
The coming of Europeans to Texas impacted the Native peoples in many
ways. The Europeans certainly introduced devastating diseases and encroached
on their lands. But Native lifeways were impacted first and most significantly by
the acquisition of horses through theft and trade. Access to trade, primarily with
the French in northern and eastern Texas, also offered certain Native groups easy
access to firearms. The simultaneous adoption of the horse and firearms radically
altered Native patterns of warfare, shifting the balance of power to those with greater
access to both. At the same time, Native American populations were undergoing
other dramatic social changes related to the rapid population decline due to the
introduction of European diseases. These factors were all in play during the Spanish
mission period in Texas.
The Spanish confusion regarding how to deal with the Native groups in
central Texas was partly a result of the tumultuous relationships between the
various groups themselves. The situation between the tribes was rapidly descending
into chaos in the first half of the eighteenth century. Prior to the early eighteenth
century, the Comanche had occupied lands north and west of modern-day Texas,
but they were advancing southward. The Comanche were the bitter enemies of the
Apache by the 1720s, at least 30 years before the San Sabá Mission was founded.
The Spanish incursions and French-supplied firearms put pressure on the Apache,
and the Comanche had pushed southward into Apache territory. Records of their
fierce animosity date to a battle near the Wichita River in southwestern Oklahoma
in 1723, 1724, or 1725. The battle is said to have lasted nine days, and the Comanche
emerged victorious. From then on, the Comanche were more powerful, and they were

31

32

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
hated and feared by the Apache (Bolton 1915:87; Faulk 1969:11; Gwynne 2010:57;
Wade 2003:174).
The Comanche continued to migrate southward, and encounters with the
Apache persisted throughout the early Spanish colonization and mission period.
Though the Apache resented the Spanish for organizing campaigns against them
between 1689 and 1750 (Dunn 1914:379) and for befriending the Tejas, they were
eventually driven to turn to the Spanish for protection from the Comanche. Apache
pleas for protection and vain promises to be missionized spurred the movement to
establish Apache missions in central Texas and led to the founding of Mission San
Sabá. “It was against this backdrop of change, violence, and instability that the Lipan
Apache came into Central Texas, cast up by the storm of Indian conflict against the
breakwater of the Spanish frontier” (Newcomb 1969:153).
SPANISH SETTLEMENTS IN CENTRAL TEXAS, 1746–1755
As the Spanish pushed northward, they began to identify the Apache people,
whether collectively as a tribe of as individual bands, as especially troublesome, and
many authorities supported their capture. Although Spanish conquest was expected
to follow the principles of the Catholic faith with application of Christian values
(Matz 1998:8–9), the taking of Indian captives was a frequent and regular, although
illegal, practice. Officially Spain’s colonial policy was “equaled in humanitarian
principles by that of no other country” and Spain “looked to the preservation of the
natives, and to their elevation to at least a limited citizenship” (Bolton 1917:52).
However, as early as the mid-seventeenth century the Spanish were taking Indians
for slave trade. Indian captives were sold in the town of Cerralvo, Nuevo León, and
the slave trade was at times even more lucrative than mining (Bolton 1912:14).
Spanish priests were outraged by these actions.
Farther north, a 1723 punitive campaign led by Nicolás Flores y Valdéz
revenged a probable theft from San Antonio. The battle, near Brownwood, Texas,
resulted in the deaths of 34 Apache and capture of 20 women and children, in
addition to 120 horses and mules, Spanish saddles, bridles, and other goods (Chipman
1992:133, 283, note 20; Dunn 1911:207). Flores defended the taking of captives as
a “bargaining tool” (Chipman 1992:134), a military tactic shared by many Plains
tribes. Father Benito Fernández de Santa Ana, president of the San Antonio missions,
pleaded for these campaigns to stop, explaining that no good could come from the
taking of Indian captives and that it only increased the hatred by the Apache
(Weddle 1964:18).
Additional Apache raids on San Antonio prompted a series of retaliatory
campaigns. In 1732, Texas’s governor, Bustillo y Zevallos, organized the most
forceful and successful offensive against them. In a battle on the San Saba River,
200 Apache warriors were killed and 30 women and children were taken captive
(Dunn 1912:187; Newcomb 1969:155–156). Bustillo also took 700 mules and horses
and 100 mule-loads of skins (Nathan and Simpson 1959:xiii). The outright Spanish
victory resulted in a peace treaty between the Spanish and the Apache in 1733
(Chipman 1992:138; Dunn 1912:187).

Chapter 2: Historical Background
The 1733 peace agreement was short-lived, and soon after it was signed,
San Antonio again experienced Apache raids “unparalleled in previous years” (Dunn
1912:187). Spanish campaigns against the Apache were frequent between 1740 and
1747. Once again in 1749 the Apache agreed to peaceful interaction, localization,
and missionization with the Spanish in return for protection from the Comanche.
Many authorities believed that the actions of the Apache were yet another ruse
and an attempt to win back their captive brethren (Dunn 1912:187–189). Although
the campaigns were relatively ineffective in subduing the Apache, the Spanish
benefited from these military excursions. The Spaniards became familiar with the
lands northwest of San Antonio (Bolton 1912:1; Chipman 1992:156; Hindes and Wolf
1995:5; Weddle 1964:16), setting the stage for the next phase of Spanish settlement
in Texas.
Apache Missionization as Pacification
Desperate to pacify the Apache and make their settlements safe, the Spanish
crown turned to the Catholic church to calm the unruly tribes. Several attempts to
missionize the Apache were made prior to the establishment of Mission San Sabá.
These undertakings were of little consequence, but they demonstrate that efforts
to missionize the Apache were made as early as 1723.
From the beginning, the Catholic church knew that, if they pushed to
missionize the Apache in Texas purely to save their souls, they would not find support
from the crown. Rather, they argued that the efforts were warranted because it
would pacify the hostile Natives and stop them from attacking Spanish settlements.
In 1723 and 1724, Father González of the San Antonio missions suggested that
missionization of the Apache could calm their restless spirits (Dunn 1912:188). In
1725, Father Francisco Hidalgo, who had initially come from Spain with the original
founders of the college at Querétaro over 40 years earlier (1683), knew the history
of the northern frontier, the missions, and the Spanish interactions with the various
Indian groups. He suggested that missionization, rather than aggravation, was the
answer to their Apache problem (Weddle 1964:3). He wanted to go into Apachería
himself to preach and teach to the Indians, but his ideas were premature, and he
was forbidden to go (Weddle 1964:12). In 1733, Father Vergara urged that a mission
be made for the Apache (Dunn 1912:188).
Father Santa Ana and Father Mariano de los Dolores, both men of high
status in the San Antonio missions, made more significant attempts to realize
that goal. Beginning in 1743, Santa Ana suggested that swift action be taken for
the conversion of the Apaches (Dunn 1912:188). Santa Ana understood some of
the cultural dynamics among the Native peoples and believed that the timing of
Comanche advancement would make the Apaches more receptive to a mission and
the protection it would offer. In 1743, he suggested that the Spanish establish a
presidio in the Apache lands, and in 1745 he specifically named the San Saba River
as an ideal locale to protect and convert them (Dunn 1914:381). With this request,
Santa Ana wisely included the suggestion that valuable mineral resources existed
in Apachería (Matz 1998:35; Weddle 1964:19).

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Santa Ana reinstated his petition in 1745, adding a suggestion that presidios
be placed on the San Saba, Pedernales, and Colorado Rivers and Salado Creek. No
action was taken, but his persistent correspondence began to turn the wheels of
bureaucracy at least temporarily in his favor (Dunn 1912:191, 1914:383).
Meanwhile, Father Dolores began to establish a rapport with the Tonkawa
in east-central Texas, visiting their lands as early as 1734. In 1746, the San Xavier
missions were founded on the San Gabriel River. Don Felipe de Rábago y Terán was
the captain of the presidio.17 He was portrayed as a “cruel and lustful man” (Faulk
1969:13), and he drove off many of the mission Indians. Poor relations between
Captain Rábago, his battalion, the priests, and the mission Indians would later
affect the fate of Mission San Sabá.
In March 1749, the Spanish made another peace agreement with the
Apache, and another petition to missionize followed. In September 1749, a party
of Apache visited Father Dolores, who was put in charge in the absence of Father
Santa Ana. The Indians asked to live in the San Antonio missions. He could not
allow the newly converted neophytes to congregate with the unconverted Indians,
so he instead planned to establish a temporary mission for them on the Guadalupe
River. This became Dolores’s personal goal for many years and would eventually
lead to a dispute with Father Terreros, who set his sights on the Mission San Sabá
project (Dunn 1912:189).
In November 1749, the Apache captives who had been taken in the 1740–1749
campaigns were freed. Father Dolores made another appeal to the viceroy on behalf
of the Apache mission following the release of the captives. On December 1, 1749, a
formal request was sent to the viceroy, but an unfavorable response was received on
February 2. The viceroy insisted that before anything could be concluded a detailed
statement was needed, including a description of the necessary supplies, the number
of Indians in the area, the available priests, and the location of the proposed mission
(Dunn 1912:191).
The idea of a Guadalupe River mission was dropped completely, and a new
plan was formed by Father Santa Ana and sent to the viceroy in February of 1750.
Santa Ana stated that the College of Santa Cruz was ready to take on the conversion
of the Apache. He proposed that the entire garrison and presidio of San Antonio be
moved to the Pedernales River. The river is in what was then considered to be the
“gateway to the Apache country.” He asked that a pueblo and a mission be established.
He stated that the Apache chiefs had requested that the presidio be located two to
three leagues from the mission. The Apache would camp at the proposed site until
a mission was built (Dunn 1912:193).
This proposal was sent to the viceroy, who rejected this project as well.
However, the viceroy did see some importance in the matter and suggested that a
Felipe de Rábago y Terán is an interesting character in Texas history. Two recent publications
emphasize his military career and his personal actions. Weddle’s After the Massacre (2007) brings
to light Terán’s vengeful tactics to repossess his “rightful” position as the captain of the San Sabá
presidio. Chipman and Elizondo’s A New Light on Felipe Rábago y Terán (2007) depicts a malicious
character who climbed from the “lowest rung of Spanish nobility” to the rank of captain at two
Texas presidios and was knighted by the Order of Santiago.

Chapter 2: Historical Background
junta, or council meeting, take place in San Antonio regarding the establishment
of an Apache mission. The meeting was scheduled for March 20, 1750, but Father
Santa Ana became extremely ill. He retired as president of the San Antonio missions
and eventually returned to Mexico City for treatment. Father Dolores, who replaced
him, did not support the Pedernales mission plan. He suggested that the meeting
be canceled, but it was too late. The meeting was held, but it was dominated by
accusations from the citizens of San Antonio, which led to indecision on the part of
the officials. The end result was that no new missions were to be founded at that
time, at least not under the jurisdiction of San Antonio (Dunn 1912:193–196).
Events Leading to the Founding of Mission San Sabá
As the Catholic church was seeking to gain a foothold among the Native
peoples in central Texas, several events were key in leading up to the founding of
Mission San Sabá in 1757. Among these were the first mission for the Apaches,
established in northern Mexico in 1754 and the founding of a mission/presidio
settlement on the San Gabriel River in central Texas beginning in 1746. Aside
from the ecclesiastic motives, previous mineral prospecting in central Texas led to
speculation that valuable silver deposits might be found in the San Sabá region.
Mission San Lorenzo in Coahuila, Mexico
Father Alonso Giraldo de Terreros of the College of Santa Cruz de Querétaro
is recognized as the founder of the first Apache mission: San Lorenzo. This first
mission was located in what is now northern Mexico.18 Terreros established the
mission in December 1754 south of the Río Grande in northern Coahuila. The
mission was put under the protection of the pueblo of San Ildefonso rather than the
protection of a neighboring presidio19 (Dunn 1912:197). Based on research by Herbert
Bolton, Dunn (1912:197) suggested that the Indians for whom this mission was built
were the Natajés, Síbolas, and Tucubantes tribes, but more recent work by Wade
(2003:183–184) indicates that they were actually Apache bands. Regardless, this
first location of the San Lorenzo Mission was “a logical step in the progression of the
San Sabá plan” (Dunn 1912:196). The mission was considered a success by March
1755, and Terreros returned to Querétaro to plan his next mission (Dunn 1912:199).
But while he was gone, the Apache neophytes revolted, burning the buildings and
deserting the mission. The revolt and destruction of the San Lorenzo Mission was
blamed on the spurious attitude of the Apache and their overall resistance to settle,
especially so far from their homeland (Dunn 1912:200). Thus, the destruction of the
San Lorenzo Mission in Coahuila led directly to the founding of the mission on the
San Saba River in the Apache country of central Texas.
The first San Lorenzo Mission in Coahuila (1754–1755) should not be confused with the later
Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz (1762-1770) in Real County, Texas (Wade 2003:183–184;
192–199).
19
The mission was built two leagues from the small village of San Fernando de Austria and 18
leagues from the presidio (Dunn 1912:199) specifically to keep the mission separate from its
protectors. Numerous incidents of Spanish soldiers having sex with Native women solidified a
model for the separation of missions and presidios. Though the distance was reduced significantly
at Mission San Sabá, it is the author’s opinion that this set the precedent for the intentional
three-league (approximately four-mile) separation between the mission and the presidio on the
San Saba River.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
San Xavier Missions in East-Central Texas
The San Xavier mission on the San Gabriel River in Milam County lasted
from 1746 to 1755 (Bolton 1915:43–55; 185–203; Gilmore 1969:11–38; Gilmore
2010a; Supplee 2010). The Spanish arrived in the spring of 1746, planted crops, and
established temporary buildings (Bolton 1915:45), but it was not until 1748–1749
that the three missions were built: San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas, 20 San
Ildefonso, and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria (Figure 2.3). A presidio to protect
the missions, San Francisco Xavier de Gigedo, was not built until 1851. As the first
in a series of mission-presidio complexes established in the central Texas region,
they were an important stepping stone leading to the Mission San Sabá effort.
The San Xavier missions served several Native groups in the eastern part of
central Texas, as well as some of the groups living along the coastal plains. Gilmore
(1969:11–38) identifies dozens of tribal or band names for the local Natives. The
peoples most commonly present at these mission were the Mayeye, Yojuane, Tonkawa
(also Tancahue), Tanchagues, Hierbipiame (also Ervipiame or Yebipiames), Coco,
Deadose, Bedai, and Orcoquiza (Bolton 1915:44, 186, 190; Gilmore 1969:17, 26–28,
31). Three of these bands—the Mayeye, Yojuane, and Hierbipiame or Ervipiame—
are specifically identified as being affiliated with the Tonkawa; the Bidai, Deadose,
and Akokisa are attributed to the coastal Atakapa; and the Coco are considered to
be Karankawa (Bolton 1915:50, 198; Gilmore 2010a, 2010d; Newcomb 1961:59, 134,
318; Supplee 2010). Several of the groups brought to the San Xavier missions were
enemies of the Apache, and the Apache began raiding the San Xavier missions as
soon as they were established (Bolton 1915:187–190; Wade 2003:178–179). In 1748
alone there were at least four major Apache raids (Bolton 1915:188). This was yet
another reason for strained relations between the Apache and the Spanish.
The San Xavier missions were plagued by problems, not the least of which
were the regular attacks by the Apache. The missionaries and mission Indians also
suffered from drought and crop failure, supply shortages, disease (including smallpox),
and infighting between Spanish missionaries and administrators (Bolton 1915:43–55,
185–203; Gilmore 1969:11–38). Even as the missions were still under construction in
mid-1748, an official inspection report identified a myriad of problems, including land
that was “unsuited to cultivation,” a river that “was not permanent and irrigation
facilities were not good,” and Indians who “did not desire missions” (Bolton 1915:196).
Ultimately, the mission Indians learned that the Spanish could not support or protect
them, and even groups thought to be loyal began to desert by 1749.
The ultimate downfall of the San Xavier mission effort began when the
Spanish decided to build a presidio there in 1750, and Felipe de Rábago y Terán was
appointed as captain.21 Portrayed as a man of despicable character, Rábago y Terán
arrived at San Xavier in December 1751 and immediately began causing trouble
and alienating the mission priests. In a series of events straight out of a dime-store
Bolton (1915:184) notes that mission was commonly called San Francisco Xavier, but that its
first formal name was Nuestra Señora de los Dolores del Rio de San Xavier.
21
The following brief outline of Felipe de Rábago y Terán’s tenure at the San Xavier missions is
derived from four sources: Bolton (1915:251–271), Castañeda (1936:363–369), Gilmore (1969:31–
38), and Weddle (1964:30–35).

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
novel, Rábago y Terán had an affair with a married woman, then imprisoned and
tortured her husband, Juan Joseph Zevallos (or Ceballos). When the imprisoned man
escaped and sought sanctuary at Mission Candelaria, Rábago y Terán violated the
right of sanctuary and rode his horse into the church to retrieve him. The priests
also accused Rábago y Terán of not providing soldiers to protect the mission and of
allowing the morals of the garrison to deteriorate. They also accused the soldiers of
having extramarital affairs, and the soldiers in turn accused the priests of “breaking
the seal of secrecy in the confessional” (Bolton 1915:259). The priests even went as
far as to excommunicate Captain Rábago y Terán and the entire garrison in February
1752. Rábago y Terán then sent two of his soldiers to Mexico to “seek absolution for
the garrison” (Gilmore 1969:35). While they were gone, most of the other soldiers
were given absolution.
Not surprisingly, all of these events put a serious strain on the relationships
between the priests, the soldiers, and Rábago y Terán. But the story does not end
there. One evening in May 1752, one of the mission priests, Father Joseph Ganzábal,
and the abused husband, Juan Zevallos, were killed under mysterious circumstances.
Zevallos died of bullet wounds, while an arrow killed Father Ganzábal. A mission
Indian named Andrés confessed to having shot Father Ganzábal, claiming that
he was following orders from Rábago y Terán and had been accompanied by four
soldiers dressed as Indians. But then the Indian later “retracted his confession and
Captain Rábago insisted the Cocos had committed the crimes” (Gilmore 1969:36).
Rábago y Terán was accused of murder and removed as the commander at
the presidio. Another commander was assigned to the presidio at San Xavier, but
Felipe’s uncle, Pedro de Rábago y Terán was appointed commander in August 1754.
The situation was bleak in the summer of 1755 because of another drought, and
no action had been taken on repeated requests to abandon the mission. Without
receiving an official order or permission, Pedro de Rábago y Terán simply abandoned
the San Xavier missions in August 1755 and marched everyone to the presidio and
mission on the San Marcos River (Chipman 1992:150; Gilmore 2010a; Supplee 2010).
Many historians have told the remarkable stories of Felipe de Rábago y
Terán at San Xavier (Bolton 1915:251–271; Castañeda 1936: 363–369; Gilmore
1969:31–38; Weddle 1964:30–35), and they leave no doubt that the captain’s
deplorable behavior was a major factor that led to the demise of the San Xavier
missions. But, as discussed later in this chapter, his 1751–1752 command of the
San Xavier presidio would not be the last that would be heard of this unsavory
character. After eight years in exile, house arrest, and prison in Coahuila, “Rábago
was given a dubious acquittal” of the murder charges (Gilmore 1969:36). He would
then resurface to lead “a malicious slander campaign” against Colonel Ortiz Parrilla,
who led the 1759 military expedition in retaliation for the attack on Mission San
Sabá (Weddle 2007:37).
Silver Mining and Missions in Central Texas
The failure of the San Xavier missions was indeed an important event that
led to the founding of the Mission San Sabá, but the potential for silver mining

Chapter 2: Historical Background
in central Texas was an equally important impetus. Though missionization and
mining may not seem related at first glance, a focused look at the missionization of
Texas—especially in the El Paso and central Texas regions—exposes Spain’s deeply
engrained and longstanding desire to obtain mineral resources in the northern
frontier.
Mineral riches were a driving force for the Spanish dating back to their
occupation of the Caribbean islands in the early sixteenth century. The spread
of news of Aztec gold attracted settlers to Mexico. Mining efforts in Mexico were
minimal but notable as early as 1543. A 1546 discovery in Zacatecas led to a silver
boom, attracting miners and settlers, including a newly developing cattle industry
to support the mining (Chipman 1992:46, 54). These early mining efforts, combined
with Cabeza de Vaca’s 1536 descriptions of gold and other metals in northwestern
Mexico, spurred exploration in the northern frontier (Mayo 1995:6). Coronado’s
1540–1542 expedition led him onto the southern Plains in search of the Seven Cities
of Cibola. The expedition was unsuccessful in finding the fabled cities of gold, but
it demonstrates that the Spanish would go to great lengths based on unfounded
rumors of potential wealth.
Franciscans are given credit for discovering silver in the El Paso region in
1680 (Crane 1908:30), and the first red ochre sample was brought to San Antonio by
Indians in 1700 (Caran et al. 2000:vi).22 Campaigns against the Apache beginning
around 1731 led the Spanish into central Texas, where they heard rumors of mineral
deposits (Bolton 1915:30; Dunn 1914:382).
The Spanish began prospecting for minerals in central Texas as early as
1753. Patten (1970:228) states that a mine was opened that year “by five Spaniards
from San Antonio who were guided to the hill containing gossan [decomposed rock
associated with an ore deposit or mineral vein] by some friendly Apache Indians.”
Three additional expeditions to central Texas occurred between 1754 and 1756.
The official purpose of these expeditions was to inspect lands for possible mission
sites in the Apachería, but the Spanish were also interested in the region’s mineral
resources. 23
Following a series of letters from the San Antonio missionaries, the viceroy
gave an order to explore the Apachería in 1753 or 1754 (Dunn 1914:383). The first
exploration began in 1754, when Lieutenant Juan Galván and Father Miguel Aranda
(both from San Antonio) explored the Llano, Pedernales, and San Saba River areas
for possible mission locations. Galván found two potential mission sites on the San
Saba River, noting that this portion of the river could supply two irrigation ditches,
each supporting three leagues of land (Castañeda 1936:361). “A band of Apaches was
encountered by the expedition, and when informed for what purpose the Spaniards
were visiting their country, they expressed great joy. Gifts were distributed, a cross
was fashioned, and a procession held” (Dunn 1914:383, note 3). They erected an
Red ochre is often associated with silver deposits.
Castañeda (1936:360) states that orders to explore for a mission location for the Apache were
issued on April 14, 1752, but were not carried out until June 3, 1753, due to the chaos that ensued
after the 1752 murders at San Xavier Mission. However, Dunn states that the viceroy approved
exploration of Apachería in either 1753 or 1754 (see Dunn 1914:383, note 1).

8-ft wooden cross at the site Galván proposed for the mission, but it is not known
if the place was given a name at that time (Castañeda 1936:361). Father Aranda
conducted a religious service there in which the Indians participated (Castañeda
1936:361; Weddle 1964:25).
Galván’s expedition reported signs of mineral deposits in the region (Newcomb
1969:158). Father Aranda, who went on the expedition in place of Father Dolores,
may have written the actual report. Dolores had made this mission his personal goal,
and he may have instructed Father Aranda to make a positive statement regarding
the potential for mineral deposits, understanding the Spanish crown’s interest in
mining activities (Matz 1998:35; Weddle 1964:26). The Spanish intended to mine
for silver in the central Texas area, and the establishment of a mission and presidio
on the San Saba River would allow them easy access to and protection of mine
locations. Rumors of rich mineral deposits must have been widely spread, for even
civilians in San Antonio traveled to the San Saba River area in search of wealth
(Weddle 1964:27). Besides his interest in the region’s mining potential, Galván may
also have hoped to be appointed as the new presidio’s commander, although this
did not come about.
A second expedition into central Texas was made in 1754–1755 by Don Pedro
de Rábago y Terán,24 whose nephew was the commander of the failing San Xavier
missions.25 Don Pedro de Rábago y Terán gave positive feedback regarding the surveyed
lands, described the San Saba River, and recommended possible mission sites (Dunn
1914:384). He observed that the valley had the capability to support three different
irrigation canals that could support two leagues each (Castañeda 1936:372). Don
Pedro de Rábago y Terán set up camp about half a league (1.3 miles) from Galván’s
cross and named the site Paso de Santa Cruz (Holy Cross Ford) (Castañeda 1936:361).
Additionally, he noted there was a hill rich with silver near the Llano River as well
as 467 Apaches camped on the Pedernales River (Castañeda 1936:372).
Rábago y Terán’s report was received with mixed feelings by authorities in
Mexico, but it added credence to the missionaries’ calls for an Apache mission in the
area. Based on the document, Father Santa Ana hoped to garner further support for
the San Sabá plan, stating, “The settlement of this region would make a straight
frontier line from eastern Texas to New Mexico, and the union of the northern
provinces would be safeguarded against French encroachment” (Dunn 1914:384-385,
note 7). Like Galván, perhaps Rábago y Terán was hoping for a military appointment
at the future presidio on the San Saba River.
In 1756, a third mineral exploration expedition was made into central
Texas. The year before, the governor of Texas, Jacinto de Barrios y Jauregui, “gave
report that a vein had been discovered in the aforesaid site of Los Almagres, which
promised abundance of silver ore of good quality” (West 1904:54). Governor Barrios y
Castañeda states that Don Pedro de Rábago y Terán left San Antonio on December 23, 1754
(1936:370).
25
After Felipe de Rábago y Terán was excommunicated following the affair and murder scandal,
his uncle Pedro de Rábago y Terán replaced him as commander at San Xavier. Rábago y Terán
saw San Sabá as a chance to keep his own military commission as well as that of his unit (Dunn
1914:384; Weddle 1964:27); however, he died before he could realize this ambition. Colonel Don
Diego Ortiz Parrilla replaced him as the new commander at San Xavier.
24

Chapter 2: Historical Background
Jauregui then appointed Don Bernardo de Miranda y Flores, the lieutenant governor
of Texas, to lead an expedition to investigate these reported deposits. In February
and March 1756, Miranda y Flores journeyed to a place called Los Almagres.26 The
Miranda expedition served as an official inspection searching for mineral deposits
(Brady 2000:24; Patten 1970; Mayo 1995:10).27 The area Miranda y Flores was
investigating was composed of two deposits, collectively called Los Almagres. An
area near the Llano River was called Cerro del Almagre (Mountain of Ochre), while
a larger vein on the upper Colorado River was called El Almagre Grande (The
Big Ochre). The latter was “thought to be richer because less was known about it”
(Castañeda 1936:379–380).
Miranda y Flores found the Cerro del Almagre locality, obtained an ore
sample there, and returned to San Antonio. The three-pound sample was sent to
Mexico City for assay, where Manuel Aldaco used the smelting method to extract a
small amount (one-tenth of an ounce) of silver (the amalgamation method extracted
no silver). Although the ore sample was considered to be too small to be conclusive,
Aldaco felt compelled to confer with a wealthy silver mine owner named Pedro
Romero de Terreros (Patten 1970:228–232; Wade 2003:184), who would later become
the financier of the Mission San Sabá. Based on additional information provided
by an Apache chief, Miranda y Flores believed that the Los Almagres area was rich
in minerals. He reported confidently that “the mines of Cerro del Almagre were so
numerous that [Governor Barrios] could guarantee a mine to each inhabitant in
the entire Province of Texas” (Castañeda 1936:381; Patten 1970:245).
Following these mineral explorations, Father Dolores pressed the authorities
to build another mission for the Apache in central Texas, and Father Santa Ana
supported the project from his deathbed in Querétaro (Dunn 1914:384). However,
the governor of Coahuila did not trust the Apache due to their past actions (Dunn
1914:385). The question remained: What was to be done with the failing San Xavier
project and the garrison there? The missionaries were quick to remind authorities of
the rich mineral possibilities that would need presidios for protection (Dunn 1914:386).
The historical record leaves little doubt that the Spanish had multiple motives for
promoting settlements in central Texas. The Catholic church was searching for souls
to save, while others had their eyes on the region’s potential wealth.
Positive feedback from three separate mineral explorations (Galván in 1754,
Rábago y Terán in 1755, Miranda y Flores in 1756), combined with the church’s goal
to create an Apache mission in central Texas, provided a convenient answer to what
Miranda was formally commissioned on November 15, 1755, but his expedition was delayed in
San Antonio. Four citizens were to be chosen to accompany him from the village of San Fernando,
and the hope of riches caused jealousy, resulting in a delayed departure on February 17, 1756
(Castañeda 1936:379–380).
27
Mayo notes that no actual mining occurred in central Texas but rather “prospecting” to locate
potential mines. Prospecting was a less invasive process, requiring less time and fewer people,
but also leaving less in the way of archeologically recoverable materials (Mayo 1995:114). In her
research on Los Almagres, Mayo (1995) investigated four sites in San Saba and Llano Counties
and concluded that the Boyd Shaft (41LL409) was most likely the Los Almagres mine. However,
later research by Caran et al. (2000; see also Caran 2000) pinpoints a group of mine shafts on
the Stotts Ranch, at the foot of Packsaddle Mountain and 3 miles southeast of the Boyd Shaft, as
the probable Los Almagres location. Since the Boyd and Packsaddle shafts are within a 3-mile
radius, it is likely that when the Spanish referred to the Los Almagres they meant the general
area that included all of these shafts.

should be done with the failing San Xavier missions. At the request of the viceroy, a
general council was held in Mexico City in February 1756. The council decided that
the missions should be relocated and made the following recommendations: (1) to raise
the number of men serving in the San Xavier garrison from 50 to 100 and move them
to the San Saba River location; (2) to move the few remaining Tonkawa neophytes
from San Xavier to San Antonio and distribute them among the missions there; and
(3) to move the missionaries from San Xavier “to the San Sabá and establish three
missions under the shelter of the presidio for the conversion of the Apache tribes”
(Dunn 1914:385–386). With the council’s recommendations to the viceroy, the stage
was set for the creation of a mission and presidio on the San Saba River.

Upon Father Terreros’s return to Mexico from his San Lorenzo Mission
on the Rio Grande, his wealthy cousin, Don Pedro Romero de Terreros, made him
an offer. Pedro Terreros was a successful mine owner and one of the most affluent
men in New Spain. He was known as a generous man (Dunn 1914:387). Don Pedro
Terreros offered to financially support several Apache missions for three years. His
offer stipulated four conditions: (1) the Spanish government would bear the cost of
military protection; (2) the missions were to be located in Apache country; (3) Father
Giraldo de Terreros was to be in charge of the missions; and (4) the missionaries
would come from the two primary colleges, Colégio de la Santa Cruz de Querétaro
and San Fernando de Mexico (Dunn 1914:387). He was also “allowed a special
dispensation in a law suit in which he was concerned” (Dunn 1914:388).
Apparently, it was also part of the arrangement that the religious articles
(such as the sacramental ornaments and vessels) belonging to the San Xavier
missions be transferred to the new San Sabá missions. However, because Father
Dolores harbored negative feelings toward Father Terreros, Dolores was not willing
to comply with this condition (Dunn 1914:390, note 11).
The Terreros family was not the first to offer private support for founding
a mission. In 1686, Father Nicolás López hoped to receive more missionaries and
supplies to found missions for the Jumano tribes in the El Paso area. He offered, “on
the promise of his two wealthy brothers of El Rosario, to furnish for the undertaking
five hundred fanegas of maize, three hundred beeves [beef cattle], and two hundred
horses” (Bolton 1912:23). Father López’s offer was considered extravagant at the
time and was not given further consideration.
Mission Rosario, in Goliad County, Texas, was also funded partially by private
donations. Rodnick (1974) states that government funding was slow to contribute to
the newly founded mission. As a result, money to begin work was “raised by private
gifts to the college...and the missionaries at the Espíritu Santo compound...supplying
not only the furniture and ornaments but a good deal of the food” (Rodnick 1974:9).
However, Mission San Sabá was unique in that it was entirely privately
funded. Previously in Mexico, missions were established and funded by the state,

Chapter 2: Historical Background
although they were expected to become fully functional and self-sustaining within
10 to 20 years (Almaráz 1979:6; Weddle 1964:190). This was the model used for most
Texas missions as well. Eventually, missions established by the various missionary
colleges were supposed to become secularized, which was the “transition from official
mission status to ordinary Spanish society” (Wright 2010). In secularization, “the
mission’s communal properties were privatized, the direction of civil life became
a purely secular affair, and the direction of church life was transferred from the
missionary religious orders to the Catholic diocesan church” (Wright 2010). In
practice, most Texas missions never did become self-sustaining, and they were seldom
successful from a financial standpoint. Many were total financial disasters. Texas
missions were often abandoned long before they might have become secularized. But
a number of Texas missions were long-lived, including the San Antonio missions,
which were fully or partially secularized in the 1790s. All the remaining missions
(except those in the El Paso district) were officially secularized between 1824 and
1830 in the early years under the Republic of Mexico (Wright 2010).
In contrast to the most successful Texas missions, which existed for decades,
Mission San Sabá lasted only 11 months and was an ecclesiastic and financial failure.
But the fact that Mission San Sabá was a private enterprise is largely irrelevant in
this case, because the mission’s failure was not related to financing.
Don Pedro Terreros and Silver Mining
Don Pedro Terreros’s interest in the San Sabá mission project was directly
related to his interest in the mineral deposits reported in the San Saba River
region. Don Pedro, a wealthy mine owner himself, made his offer to the Colleges of
Santa Cruz de Querétaro and San Fernando de Mexico soon after Pedro de Rábago
y Terán’s report of the promising mining conditions in Texas. Furthermore, he
stated as a condition of his offer that the mission should be in the area near where
Rábago y Terán surveyed. Therefore, Don Pedro’s offer was an act of both “piety
and practicality” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:xiv). Further personal benefits were
the lawsuit dispensation and King Charles III’s bestowing the title of count for his
charitable contributions in 1768.
The opportunity to survey for minerals was ample motivation for the Spanish
to want to occupy the region. The documentary record demonstrates the importance
that mining had to the crown and the progress of Spain in the New World, to the
advancement of the missions, and to the San Sabá project in particular (Bolton
1912:22; Dunn 1912:188, 1914:382). In letters to the viceroy, priests would often
include descriptions of the minerals as a way of demonstrating the financial benefits
of their propositions.
There are two different schools of thought regarding how important the
mining potential of the region was to the site selection and founding of Mission
San Sabá. Weddle (1964:22) suggests that mining potential played a minimal role
in the decision making, but he acknowledges that other historians believe minerals
played a much larger role. He believes that “pushing back the frontier and extending
Spanish dominion appear to have been the primary goals” (Weddle 1964:22).

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
In contrast, Nathan and Simpson (1959:xiv) support a direct correlation
between the Los Almagres mining potential and the donation made by Don Pedro
Terreros to found Mission San Sabá. In an introduction to a report by Colonel Ortiz
Parrilla regarding ore from the Llano River, Nathan and Simpson (1959:141) state:
“In order to make new settlements palatable to the hard-pressed Crown authorities,
it was necessary to prove that they would be self-supporting. The discovery of the
silver deposit of Los Almagres on the Llano River in 1756 certainly had a great
deal to do with the selection of the San Sabá Mission site near by.” Mayo (1995:36,
citing Castañeda 1936:379) seconds this opinion in her study of Spanish mining
in central Texas. The primary documents provide a great deal of evidence that the
potential mineral wealth was important to Don Pedro Terreros and was a strong
motivating factor in his decision to fund the project. For example, Terreros had served
as a consultant to the viceroy concerning Miranda’s Los Almagres mine (Weddle
1964:40), and he helped analyze the first ore samples from the Los Almagres mine
(Mayo 1995:22). Interpretations of the assay results vary in the historical record.
Nathan and Simpson (1959:xiv) state that Don Pedro “found them promising,” while
Mayo (1995:22) states, “The assay report showed that the amount of silver extracted
from the ore was so small that the economic value could not be determined,” later
noting that 30 cartloads or more would be necessary for an accurate assessment
(Mayo 1995:43 citing Kress 1920). Either way, it is clear that Terreros was highly
interested in the mining potential of central Texas.
The importance of the region’s mining potential is demonstrated even after
the establishment of Mission San Sabá. Colonel Ortiz Parrilla was very dubious
about the success of the mission and probably equally disappointed in the lack of
minerals in the San Saba region. In June 1757, just two months after the presidio’s
founding, he asked that the mission be relocated at the Río de las Chanas (Llano
River) to protect the area around Miranda’s Los Almagres mine (Weddle 1964:59).
After the March 1758 attack on Mission San Sabá, the suggestion to move to “los
Chanas or Chamas” (other names for Los Almagres) was made again (Mayo 1995:11;
West 1904:54–55). In fact, Colonel Ortiz Parrilla had personally examined ore
samples from Los Almagres the month before the attack, and three weeks after the
event he wrote a letter to the viceroy pleading to move the presidio to Los Almagres
(Nathan and Simpson 2000:141–147). He felt that establishing a mining community
there would contribute to the royal treasury and offset the expenses of relocating
(Nathan and Simpson 2000:146).
Expectations for Mission San Sabá
The Catholic church had great expectations for Mission San Sabá. The
Apache living in the area were estimated to number as many as 4,000 by Captain
Urrutia of the Béxar presidio in San Antonio (Castañeda 1936:3:369–376; Weddle
1964:27). Bancroft (1886:626) and Bolton (1915:20) both report that 20 missions
were to be founded in the area.28 The reference to 20 missions may have been a
mistranslation; Weddle (1964:40), for example, writes that Terreros would pay for
On the other hand, Dunn (1914:387, note 18) specifically notes that none of the documents he
saw stated that the intent was to establish 20 missions.
28

Chapter 2: Historical Background
as many as 20 missionaries. Most of the evidence indicates that just 3 missions
were to be founded and that the founding expedition took the supplies and property
necessary for not all of them (Weddle 1964:38). According to Dunn (1914:391), the
viceroy hoped that “ultimately a flourishing town would be built up and the whole
region developed.”
In addition to Father Terreros, two priests were chosen from each of the
missionary colleges, Santa Cruz in Querétaro and San Fernando in Mexico City,
as specified by the conditions of Pedro Terreros’s offer. The priests arrived in San
Antonio in December 1756, followed a few days later by Colonel Ortiz Parrilla,
his troops, and the supply train (Dunn 1914:391). The group of priests consisted
of Fathers Terreros, Joaquín de Baños, Diego Ximénez, José de Santiesteban, and
Juan Andrés (Dunn 1914:391;Weddle 1964:43). Father Trinidad probably traveled
with the supply train. He was responsible for recording the inventory of supplies
and the cost of goods purchased, as well as making payment for transport (Dennis
1995a:78). Father Francisco de Lara, possibly a parish priest for the presidio, also
came with the group (Weddle 1964:44). A total of six priests were assigned to the
mission originally, the four who had been chosen in Mexico plus Father Trinidad
and Father Benito Valerla (Castañeda 1936:3:394–395).
While expectations for the project were high, some people had their doubts
about Apache intentions and the Mission San Sabá effort. Father Terreros agreed
to write and sign a declaration of the Apaches’ friendliness while at San Antonio
“with reservations” (Dunn 1914:392). Terreros feared that the Apache were “a bit too
much interested from a selfish standpoint, since all who had come to San Antonio
had asked for maize, sugar-cane, tobacco, and other articles” (Dunn 1914:392).
Colonel Ortiz Parrilla,29 captain of Presidio San Sabá, recognized early
on that the Apache were just after material goods and, later, protection from the
Comanche. He never believed that the Indians were serious about being missionized
(Chipman 1992:159).
Ortiz Parrilla recognized that the San Sabá project on which they were
about to embark would be a difficult venture (Dunn 1914:393). His reluctance to
move from San Antonio to the San Sabá site made some of the priests believe that
he had ulterior motives. Father Trinidad thought that the captain was finding ways
to waste project money and wrote a 17-page explanation of the situation (Dennis
1995b:79–84; Dunn 1914:396; Wade 2003:186). Father Trinidad knew exactly how
much time Ortiz Parrilla was spending, or wasting, by the delay. Ortiz Parrilla
remained dubious even after the mission was established, expressing misgivings
that ultimately proved correct.
The Founding Expedition for Mission San Sabá
The agreement between Don Pedro Terreros and the viceroy was signed in
July 1756 (Weddle 1964:41), Captain Diego Ortiz Parrilla received his assignment
Weddle (2007:157, note 11) explains that Colonel Parrilla’s “patronymic was Ortiz Parrilla, not
simply ‘Parrilla,’ as it is often given.” While older publications always referred to him simply as
Parrilla, some recent publications have adopted the more correct nomenclature (e.g., Chipman
and Elizondo 2007).

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
on September 1, 1756, and Father Terreros received his formal appointment on
September 4, 1756. The priests began collecting supplies in Mexico City. No official
date of departure has been found, but they may have left Mexico City around the
time of Father Terreros’s formal appointment in early September 1756.
The priests traveled from Mexico City to San Antonio via Querétaro and
Saltillo and other smaller villages (see Chapter 14). They arrived in San Antonio
in December 1756 followed soon after by Ortiz Parrilla (Dennis 1995b:79, #2; Dunn
1914:391).
The group stayed in San Antonio until March 1758 (Dennis 1995b:81, #14),
at which point they headed to San Marcos, where the San Xavier Missions had been
temporarily relocated. The group stayed in San Marcos for about a month, during
which time Father Trinidad believed that the captain was stalling in hopes that the
presidio would be built at Los Almagres. The captain left half of the troops and two
priests (presumably the presidio priests) in San Marcos and traveled back through
San Antonio, “an unnecessary distance of 20 leagues” (Dennis 1995b:81, #21). The
party finally arrived at the San Saba River on April 18, 1757.
Once the mission entourage arrived, construction began immediately.
Buildings were made from local wood, covered with daub, and encircled by a wooden
stockade. The temporary structures may have been comparable to those at the 1746
Mission San Francisco Xavier, which was established about a decade before Mission
San Sabá and are described by Starnes (1969:15): “The mission workers began
clearing the location for the construction of the buildings and planting of crops.
To convince the Indians of his sincerity, [Father Delores] built a church 30 varas
(eighty-three feet) long and a smaller building intended for cells and offices. The two
edifices completed a square with a stockade and thus helped create a small fort.”30
By May 4, 1757, the temporary mission on the San Saba River was in good
working order. Sometime in May, Colonel Ortiz Parrilla ordered the last of the
supplies, livestock, and soldiers left in San Marcos to join the group at San Saba
(Dennis 1995b:82, #26). As Trinidad states, the captain, “seeing that the hopes of
his project [at Los Almagres] were declining at the same time as the fortunes of
the Priests were rising…By the end of June we were all incorporated in San Sabá”
(Dennis 1995b:82, #26, #27).
Trinidad expounds on the richness of the San Saba River valley, proudly
describing the riches of its climate and land, noting that the floodplain “promise[s]
to be fruitful with whatever [seed] is scattered upon it” and comparing it to the
best shores of Mexico and even of Spain (Dennis 1995b:82 #29–#32). Furthermore,
Trinidad notes that, based on information from the presidio residence, a spring
entered the river “a short distance from the Presidio, on the south banks, another
permanent spring enters the River. It is possible there to plant three fanegas of
Starnes took this description from a letter by Fray Mariano de los Delores to Fray Benito
Fernández de Santa Anna [sic], January 19, 1746 (San Francisco el Grande Archivo, XIX, pp.
62–65; University of Texas Archives). Interestingly, Dolores adds a “glowing” report of the mission
location, water supply, wildlife, timber, and stone, closing with information about the Apache
“menace and evidence of French and English activity nearby” (Starnes 1969:15).
30

Chapter 2: Historical Background
corn, without any other work or cost than guiding the flow for irrigation” (Dennis
1995b:83, #34).
There is no documentary evidence that crops were planted near the mission
during the spring or summer of 1757. However, crops were certainly planted at the
presidio that year. This difference may be explained by the masses of consumables
that the missionaries brought with them as a result of the contributions of Don Pedro
Terreros, which the presidio lacked (see Chapter 14 and Appendix B). Regardless,
Terreros wanted to grow crops and to experiment “with what the land promised
and to moderate Don Pedro’s expenses in buying provisions, and bringing corn from
San Antonio. He [Terreros] wanted to clear a piece of land, for a small harvest, in
spite of the fact that he still did not have irrigation, and depended only on rainfall”
(Dennis 1995b:83, #36).31 Trinidad shared this plan with Ortiz Parrilla, “realizing
the total repugnance he had toward anything which led toward the establishment
and permanence of the Presidio and the missions, since the Apaches were, in his
conception, irreducible” (Dennis 1995b:83, #37). Ortiz Parrilla thought this garden
plot was insane, but Trinidad noted that Terreros was “obligated by his position…
to do whatever he could to achieve the goals [of the mission]. Since planting of corn
was the principle means for founding the Missions, he needed to begin it” (Dennis
1995b, 83–84, #39).
Terreros may also have recalled the hunger and pestilence at the San Xavier
Missions only three years prior. These conditions were primarily a result of failed
crops, forcing the inhabitants to depend on supplies from San Antonio—a proposition
that neither San Antonio nor Terreros could support (Castañeda 1936:368). Because
of the poor relationship between the two men, Terreros was surely aware that
Father Dolores at the San Antonio missions would provide no aid in support of the
San Sabá effort.
After the mission was built and a routine was established, the missionaries
waited for the Apache to arrive. Finally, in June 1757, an estimated 3,000 Apaches
appeared. They were “haughty and indifferent in their demeanor” (Dunn 1914:398;
Wade 2003:187). They only stayed for a short time, promising to come back later.
Apparently, at this or another later visit, 2 of the Apache did enter the mission, but
these were the only Natives to enter the mission.
After yet another quick visit by the Lipan Apache in July 1757 (Wade
2003:188), three of the priests became impatient and asked to leave the mission.
Only one, Father Varela, was granted permission because he had been persistent
in his letters to the college at Querétaro. He left San Sabá, probably in the summer
of 1757. The other two, Father Joaquín de Baños and Father Diego Ximénez, were
frustrated and did not see any future in the Apache friendship (Weddle 1964:59).
On July 5, 1757, they wrote: “Having fully learned the wishes of the Indians, we find
no other motive (for friendship) than the hope of receiving gifts” (Dunn 1914:401).
Trinidad does not provide exact dates on when the experimental plot of land was prepared.
However, based on the fact that Trinidad left the mission on February 12, 1758 (Dennis 1995b:84,
#44) and heard about the deaths and ruin of the mission prior to reaching Mexico City, it can be
assumed that this garden plot was prepared in January or early February 1758, only a month or
so before the destruction of the mission.
31

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Fathers Baños and Ximénez left San Sabá in the fall of 1757 but continued their
work in Texas, establishing Mission San Lorenzo de Santa Cruz on the Nueces
River in 1762. At this time, only three of the original missionaries remained on
the San Saba River: Father Terreros; his assistant Father Trinidad; and Father
Santiesteban. They spent the next several months living at the temporary mission
with their Indian servants (possibly the Tlaxcaltecans) and five soldiers from the
presidio, isolated from the rest of the world (Dunn 1914:403). Father Trinidad left
Mission San Sabá in early January 1758, but Father Molina arrived on February
1, 1758 (Weddle 1964:65), having been sent to replace one of the missionaries who
had left previously.
There are no documents that detail the number of people living at Mission
San Sabá on a daily basis in 1757 and early 1758. Although a few people are known
to have arrived at or departed the mission at various times during its 11 months of
existence, there is no way to know how many people were there at any one moment
or exactly who they were. However, the people present at the mission on the day
of the attack may be a fair representation. On any given day from early April 1757
through March 16, 1758, the mission was probably occupied by 2 to 4 priests, along
with 5 or 6 soldiers.32 Some of the soldiers’ wives as well as a few children were also
likely to have been present, along with 1 or 2 Apaches and perhaps 7 to 9 servants.
The latter may have included Spaniards (possibly the mule driver named Nicolás),
and perhaps the Tlaxcaltecan Indians who were brought from Mexico. There were
probably about 30 people at the mission on March 16, 1758, the day of the attack,
although accounts vary from 17 to 35 (Nathan and Simpson 1959:52).
Thus, Mission San Sabá was occupied by only a small number of people
during its 11 months of existence. The only exceptions were the few times when
groups of Apache Indians came to visit for brief periods. Only two or three such
incidents are documented in the records. On June 30 through early July 1757, an
estimated 3,000 Apache came to the San Saba River on their way to hunt buffalo;
and several times throughout the fall and winter, Apache passed through the mission
(Castañeda 1936:398, 400; Dunn 1914:400, 402; Wade 2003:187­–188).
Events Leading to the Mission Attack
Throughout Texas, there were suspicions that the northern tribes were
planning a major attack. It was reported that they were converging for a common
cause (Weddle 1964:68). Rumors of hostile plans floated around San Sabá and San
Antonio throughout the winter of 1757–1758. Prior to the massacre, several events
took place that made Colonel Ortiz Parrilla feel ominous about the mission’s fate.
On February 25, 1758, while Joseph Antonio Flores was watching over a herd of
grazing livestock, Indians converged and scattered the livestock (Weddle 1964:68).
Then on March 2, there was an Indian attack on the presidial horse herd. Ortiz
Parrilla sent out soldiers to collect 59 lost or stolen horses. After 12 days, the tired
soldiers returned with only 1 horse and reported that 8 horses were found along the
Trinidad stated that there were five soldiers at the mission most of the time: “The bodyguard
provided to the Priests was composed of five soldiers, even though at first there were six” (Dennis
1995b:82, #25).
32

Chapter 2: Historical Background
trail that had been killed by the Indians. The soldiers reported that the area “was
crawling with Indians, armed and ready for battle” (Weddle 1964:68).
Fearing an attack, Ortiz Parrilla sent soldiers to escort a supply train coming
from San Antonio. The men were attacked at the Pedernales River, and some were
wounded (Weddle 1964:68). With this second attack, Ortiz Parrilla sent a warning
to Father Terreros and the other priests at the mission. The colonel sent a soldier,
Luis Padilla, to the mission on March 15 to request that the priests seek refuge
at the presidio, but they declined. That same day, Ortiz Parrilla made a personal
visit to ask the missionaries to come to the presidio for protection, but again they
declined his offer (Nathan and Simpson 1959:60). Father Terreros had stated to Luis
Padilla that “he thought the post well-protected by its stockade and by the roofs of
the buildings, which were not thatched with straw, but covered with tile to resist
fire. The Mission was therefore better protected and more secure than the presidio
itself ” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:95–96).
Norteño Attack on Mission San Sabá
The events that occurred at Mission San Sabá on March 16, 1758, are
generally well documented, but many of the details are shrouded in mystery. This is
due, at least in part, to the fact that the only accounts are the written records of the
Spanish survivors and eyewitnesses. Much of the story is derived from testimonies
given by the survivors to Colonel Ortiz Parrilla on March 22, 1758, six days after
the attack. Individuals who witnessed and survived the attack, such as Juan Leal,
who watched events from the river, and Father Molina, who crawled to safety at the
presidio, offered their own personal perspectives. These depositions were mailed
to the viceroy as the official statement of the events. Fortunately, these documents
survived to be translated and published by Nathan and Simpson (1959).
However, there are many gaps and contradictions in these accounts. In
addition, they are biased by the chroniclers’ cultural views, religious beliefs, and
motivations for telling the story. For example, the church perspective focused on the
martyrdom of the priests and the failure of the military to come to their aid, while
the military perspective focused on the overwhelming size of the enemy force as
justification for the soldiers’ inability to save the mission.
Most secondary histories of Mission San Sabá refer to the massacre that
took place there, but this simply parrots the perspective offered in the original
Spanish documents. The term “massacre” itself makes it clear that the Spanish
viewed themselves as the victims in this situation. An unprovoked attack on a
sacred Christian place and the killing of unarmed Catholic priests by uncivilized
savages could only be considered a massacre. But the Norteños, the Native peoples
who were the aggressors, certainly had a different perspective. In their eyes, the
Spanish were the invaders in their homeland, and these unwanted intruders were
there to harbor their Apache enemies.
The summary of the attack that follows is told from the Spanish viewpoint
because that is the perspective that has survived. The story is derived primarily
from the translated documents in the San Sabá Papers (Nathan and Simpson 1959).

49

50

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
This story serves its primary purposes of providing the historical context needed for
interpreting the archeological remains of Mission San Sabá later in this report. It is
not intended to be a comprehensive account of what happened on that fateful day,
and it only touches on some of the many discrepancies in the various eyewitness
accounts and subsequent interpretations of the events.
In the early morning of March 16, 1758, Father Santiesteban was holding
mass. The sounds of Indians yelling and shooting off guns could be heard. Mounted
Indians encircled the mission and swarmed the surrounding hills; their numbers
were estimated between 1,500 and 2,000 (Nathan and Simpson 1959:47, 76).
Sergeant Flores stated that the hostile Indians crowded the road for almost three
quarters of a league (1.95 miles), and the mission stockade was surrounded by
Indians firing muskets (Nathan and Simpson 1959:47). As reported by the survivors,
the attacking Indians consisted of Comanche as well as others who had signed a
peace treaty, including the Tejas. The Spanish called the attacking Indians the
Norteños, a collective term for “Nations of the North” (Bolton 1915:4). Eyewitness
depositions refer to several distinctive group or band names for the attacking Indians,
such as Tejas (Teyas), Comanche, Tanague (Taneaque), Vidae, and Yojuane (Yujuane
or Jujuan) (Nathan and Simpson 1959:44, 47, 54, 59, 66, 74, 82, 85, 86, 87, 128).
Unidentified Native groups may have been referenced in the statement regarding
“others farther inland to the north” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:54). It is notable,
however, that specific references were made to only two chiefs or “Captains” who
were the Norteño leaders—one a Tejas and the other a Comanche (Nathan and
Simpson 1959:86–87; Wade 2003:189).
Although many different band names appear in a wide variety of Spanish
documents and published histories pertaining to the attack, Wade (2003:190) notes
that “The testimonies from the witnesses of the attack show, without exception,
that the Tejas, Comanche, Tanague, Vidae, Yojuane, and others were the groups
responsible.” The social identity of these groups is an important topic that is
discussed later in this report (see Chapter 13), but most modern researchers are
confident that the Norteños were comprised mainly of people from two groups:
the Comanche and the Taovaya, a subgroup of the Wichita. Notably, in the 1759
retaliatory expedition to punish the perpetrators, Colonel Ortiz Parrilla went after
the Taovaya on the Red River, where they, along with their Comanche allies, traded
with the French.
The attacking Indians looked formidable, and Molina described them as
“arrayed in the most horrible attire. Besides the paint on their faces, red and black,
they were adorned with the pelts and tails of wild beasts, wrapped around them
or hanging down from their heads, as well as deer horns. Some were disguised as
various kinds of animals, and some wore feather headdresses” (Nathan and Simpson
1959:85). Molina specifically describes one Comanche “Great Chief’s” attire: “His war
dress and his red jacket were well decorated, after the manner of French uniforms,
and he was fully armed” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:86). Juan Leal described the
enemy as carrying “firearms, ammunition in large powder horns and pouches, swords,
lances, and cutlasses, while some of the youths had bows and arrows. All wore battle

Chapter 2: Historical Background
dress and had their faces painted. Many had helmets, and many had leather jerkins,
or breastplates like those of the French” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:74).
The hostile Indians explained that they sought to get revenge on the
Apache for killing some of their people on the Río Florido (Concho River) (Weddle
1964:77). Father Santiesteban continued serving mass. The soldiers prepared for
a confrontation and closed the stockade gates. One soldier recognized some of the
Indians from the San Xavier Mission and said they were friendly (Nathan and
Simpson 1959:69). In what would turn out to be a gross miscalculation, the gates were
opened (although Molina’s deposition says the Indians opened the gate themselves)
(Castañeda 1936:403; Nathan and Simpson 1959:86).
Father Molina brought out trade goods, which the Comanche chief accepted
in an unappreciative manner. Other Indians were stealing from the kitchen,
plundering through the storerooms, taking cloaks, and rounding up horses in the
corral (Nathan and Simpson 1959:70). The Indians acted as though they had a plan.
They took control of the mission complex, and Molina estimated that 300 of them
made it into the inner stockade (Nathan and Simpson 19459:86). One of the chiefs
asked if Father Terreros would give them horses. Father Terreros said he would
help them get horses from the presidio and wrote a letter to Colonel Ortiz Parrilla.
Eventually, Father Terreros agreed to go with the Indians to the presidio. The
Indians brought out Father Terreros’s horse and put a gun to its head, indicating
that he was to go with them. Mounted on horseback, Father Terreros, a few Indians,
and a soldier went through the gates of the mission. Father Terreros and the soldier
were shot almost immediately. Father Santiesteban and others were also killed. The
massacre began with a sudden onslaught.
Father Molina and eight men escaped to a room next to the chapel for
protection. They remained there all day, only letting in one man who, believing
he was dying, sought confession. The Indians “set raging fires on all sides of the
stockade, where they had provided themselves with ample supplies of firewood.”
Molina believed that this was evidence that the violence was not spontaneous but
had been planned in advance by the attackers (Nathan and Simpson 1959:88).
During the late afternoon, the room in which Father Molina and others
sought shelter began to burn. They moved to another room and eventually sought
shelter in the chapel. Sergeant Flores lists 27 people who escaped that night and
gives us an account of each. He mentions Father Molina and 5 soldiers: Ascencio
Cadena, Andrés de Villareal, Joseph de los Santos, Vicente Gutiérrez, and Joseph
Vásquez (who was badly wounded). “The others who escaped were Juan Leal, Joachín
Valdés, a youth named Nicolás, his wife, the Indian Ignacio (who is an interpreter of
the Apache language), his wife, and the wives, respectively, of the soldier Cadena and
the steward Gutiérrez, and the three Mission Indians who fled to the Presidio. Also
escaping were a young son of the steward,33 two Apache Indians, and seven other
young servants who were sons of the soldiers” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:53–54).
Terreros (2004:624) states that 20 people were able to escape the mission, 8 of whom
were children.

But Terreros (2004) states that this boy died on the road back to the presidio.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Assessment of the Destruction
Colonel Ortiz Parrilla did not attempt to go to the mission site for several
days. Fear of an attack on the presidio kept the colonel and the soldiers from leaving.
Finally, sometime between March 18 and March 20, Ortiz Parrilla, a lieutenant, 2
sergeants, and 25 soldiers “set out to reconnoiter the surrounding terrain and inspect
the devastated Mission site” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:55).34 The following quote
is from Sergeant Flores’s testimony and was transcribed by Colonel Ortiz Parrilla.
This description is important because it provides details that have implications for
potential archeological remains at the mission.
When we reached the Mission we found near the entrance to the
stockade the corpse of the Reverend Father President [Terreros].
Farther inside we found, burned to cinders, the bodies of Lázaro
de Ayalas and a son of Juan Antonio Gutiérrez. We recognized the
former by his head and the latter by a leg, which the flames had
not completely consumed. We buried the bodies in the cemetery
near the church. The ground was strewn with smoldering debris
from its ruins. We moved onward to inspect the other buildings,
only to find them all destroyed and the wreckage still burning. We
also saw bales of tobacco, boxes of chocolate, barrels of flour, and
boxes of soap, broken apart and burning. We found crates of church
ornaments broken to pieces and charred by the flames, as well as
various sacred jewels and pictures smashed to useless fragments.
The effigy of the Holy Saint Francis35 had been overturned and the
head severed from the body. When we returned to the Presidio we
carried the image with us, as well as some bars of iron and several
iron griddles and copper vessels. (Sergeant Joseph Antonio Flores
as translated in Nathan and Simpson [1959:55–56])
As they continued their survey, they found the body of the mayordomo, Juan
Antonio Gutiérrez, whose eyes were gouged out and scalp removed, and they buried
this body as well. They also found the remains of 18 oxen and an unknown number
of dead cats (Nathan and Simpson 1959:56). They found the bodies of three more
soldiers (Joachín García, Luis Chirinos, and Joseph García) between the mission
and presidio and buried them “on the roadside…closer to the mission than the
presidio” (according to Terreros 2004:624). They found nothing alive at the mission
except for a few rams and ewes, along with some salvageable items (Nathan and
Simpson 1959:65; see also Gilmore 1967:37–43). They did not find the remains of
Father Santiesteban, but did identify some charred fragments of habits (priest’s
robes). “After crossing the northern ford of the river, we came upon a level and hidden
glade between the river and the hills, where the enemy had stopped to divide their
plunder. The whole place was strewn with evidence, such as pages torn from books
and pieces of blank paper” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:56).
Hindes et al. (1995:7) and Gilmore (1969:13) state that the soldiers returned to the mission
on March 18, but Dunn (1914:411) and Castañeda (1936:406) state that this reconnaissance was
on March 20. The eyewitness account of Sergeant Flores (Nathan and Simpson 2000:55) implies
that the soldiers went to the mission on March 18, but this is not stated. Dunn and Castañeda
may have had other sources leading them to believe this occurred on March 20.
35
An article by Weddle and Lipscomb (2011) titled “The Strange Case of the Headless
Saint Francis: An Exercise in Historical Sleuthing,” discusses the appearance of a ca. 18-inch-tall
headless statue at Mucha Que, a famous Comanche-Comanchero trade site in Borden County,
Texas.

Chapter 2: Historical Background
A second reconnaissance of the mission was made on March 24, when
the body of Father Santiesteban was found. His head had been “severed from the
truck. The head was found later, almost completely consumed [by the flames] in the
ruins of the clothing storehouse.” The soldiers buried his remains in the cemetery
with Terreros and the others. Additionally, one kettle, one iron bar, and three axes
were collected and hidden, and they took with them “some remnants of [religious]
ornaments that had not been completely burned” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:98).
Five bodies were buried in the mission cemetery on March 19. There are
reports of a sixth body being been buried that day, and also perhaps at the mission
(Terreros 2004:623).
Documents indicate that Spaniards made two more short visits to the mission
within the next three years, recording the condition of the ruins. The first occurred
on September 1, 1759, immediately prior to Colonel Ortiz Parrilla’s retaliatory
march to the Red River. At that time, Ortiz Parrilla’s troops made camp “not at the
presidio de San Luis but near the ash heap that had been the Mission Santa Cruz,
some four miles downstream. This location, sparing the presidio settlement the noise
and confusion of the camp, lay adjacent to the river ford by which the march would
begin” (Weddle 2007:12). The last known Spanish record of the mission site was
made by Ortiz Parrilla’s successor, Felipe de Rábago y Terán. The new captain took
over command of Presidio San Sabá in October 1760 (Bolton 1915:93). As soon as
he arrived, Rábago y Terán went to the mission ruins, where he noted the charred
remains and the unfinished acequia (Weddle 1964:156). No more descriptions of the
mission appeared until the early twentieth century.
The Survivors and Casualty Estimates
There are many contradictions in the historical record regarding how many
people were at Mission San Sabá on the day of the attack, how many were killed or
wounded, and who the victims were. Table 2.1 summarizes (in chronological order)
estimates from several historical sources. Only three of the estimates are based on
actual eyewitness accounts; the rest are inferences made by contemporary observers
or historians based on their examinations of various primary and secondary sources.
Two of the eyewitness accounts (Father Molina and Sergeant Joseph Flores)
offer testimony concerning all of the people thought to have been killed or wounded.
Only one survivor (soldier Joseph Vásquez) mentions the number of attacking
Indians who were killed.
The historians who had access to most of the primary documents present
contradictory estimates. Dunn (1914:404) reports there were 17 people at the
mission: 3 priests, 5 soldiers, and 9 unnamed individuals (including 4 or 5 Indian
servants). However, Weddle (1964:70, note 22) uses all of the eyewitness testimonies
to come up with a total of 35 people, including 8 solders instead of 5 (see Nathan and
Simpson 1959:51). In one of the earliest written histories, Antonio Bonilla reported
only 5 deaths at the mission in his 1772 Breve compendio: Father Terreros, Father
Santiesteban, and 3 soldiers (West 1904:53). Dunn (1914:411) and Castañeda (1936)

It is not clear from Father Molina’s account if the stated number of “17 men” included himself and the 2 other priests.
Sergeant Flores stated that there were “27 men” but implied that this number included only servants, Indians, and soldiers of the guard. That these 27
men were “well armed” also implies that this number did not include the 3 priests.
3
The April 8, 1758, letter from Colonel Ortiz Parrilla states that he had placed “17 armed men” at the mission. This number probably does not include the 3 priests.
4
Hindes and Wolf (1995) list 6 people who died at the mission along with 2 soldiers who were killed between the mission and presidio.
5
Terreros (2004:624–625) lists 5 people wounded during the mission attack along with 4 soldiers who were wounded by “Norteño and Texas warriors” on
March 9, seven days before the mission attack. The soldiers were sent to escort a supply train from San Antonio to San Sabá.

Chapter 2: Historical Background
both report 10 deaths, but 2 individuals they report as killed apparently survived
(Nathan and Simpson 1959:68–72; Weddle 1964:88–89).
In their review of the The San Sabá Papers (Nathan and Simpson 1959),
Hindes and Wolf (1995) conclude that 31 people were present at the mission. Hindes
and Wolf (1995:7) state that there were 6 deaths at the mission (Father Terreros,
Father Santiesteban, 3 soldiers, and the chief steward), along with 2 soldiers who
were killed in the ravine between the mission and the presidio, bringing the total
to 8 people.
The most recent effort to tabulate the casualties is by Juan M. Romero de
Terreros. Terreros is the eighth-generation grandson of Don Pedro de Terreros,
the private financier of the Mission San Sabá effort. An avid historian of the San
Sabá project and author of the San Sabá, Misíon para los Apaches (Terreros 2000),
Terreros published an article titled “The Destruction of the San Saba Apache
Mission: A Discussion of the Casualties.” In this 2004 article, he first reviews
previous eyewitness testimonies and historical publications that present casualty
estimates. He then examines some primary archival documents found in Celaya,
Mexico, that had never been translated or published. He compiles what he believes
are comprehensive lists of 12 people killed and 5 wounded during the attack (Terreros
2004:623–625). He also mentions the sole eyewitness account that states the number
of attacking Norteños were killed (17). Terreros identifies each individual in these
lists and provides details surrounding their death or injury. Especially important,
he also notes where the bodies of the deceased were buried.
The casualty estimates by Hindes and Wolf (1995:Table 2) and Terreros
(2004:623–625) have some differences (Table 2.2). Although the estimates by Terreros
(2004) may not be the final word on the issue, he uses some newly discovered primary
documents and appears to present the most reliable estimates to date. One thing that
is clear from all the accounts is that no one has accounted for the nine Tlaxcaltecan
families brought to the mission from Saltillo with the founding expedition—a fact
pointed out by both Dunn (1914:391) and Weddle (1964:70). None of the primary
documents or eyewitness testimonies specifically mention the Tlaxcaltecan people
among the casualties or survivors. While a few of them might have been generically
counted as servants, it is likely that most or all of the Tlaxcaltecans had left the
mission before March 16. Perhaps they were among those who sought refuge at the
presidio in the days just before the attack. Testimony by Sergeant Antonio Flores
noted that there were 59 soldiers and 3 armed servants at the presidio on the day
of the attack, but a few days before they had counted 237 women, boys, and girls as
constituting “the large number of people who had sought safety inside” the presidio
(Nathan and Simpson 1959:50).
The Military’s Defense
Soon after the attack, Colonel Ortiz Parrilla defended his actions in writing
in an attempt to preserve his reputation as a military commander. The San Sabá
Papers are filled with statements by Ortiz Parrilla and eyewitnesses describing on
the number of Norteños and how well armed they were. The eyewitnesses estimated

the number of attacking Indians as between 1,500 and 2,000 (Nathan and Simpson
1959:47, 76, 82, 90). In contrast, the entire force commanded by Ortiz Parrilla
consisted of a mere “59 soldiers of the Presidio garrison and three armed servants”
(Nathan and Simpson 1959:50). Of these, 27 soldiers were “detailed to guard the
horses” or “assigned to the cattle ranch,” so only 32 soldiers were stationed at the
presidio on the morning of the attack. Immediately upon hearing of the attack
that morning, Ortiz Parrilla dispatched Sergeant Flores and 8 soldiers to aid the
mission, and 3 soldiers were sent to warn the people at the “horse corral and the
cattle ranch.” By the time the Norteños came closer to check out the presidio, the
garrison had dwindled to only 20 men (Nathan and Simpson 1959:57). Given the
small size of his command and the overwhelming odds, it seems that Ortiz Parrilla
was justified in his actions on the day of the attack.
The size of the garrison at Presidio San Sabá was typical for Spanish frontier
posts of the mid-eighteenth century, but it was completely inadequate on March 16,
1758. Up until that day, the Spanish had never seen such a large Indian force
composed of so many allied groups. They had never faced Indians so well armed or
well trained in the use of their guns. They had never seen so many French weapons

5

Chapter 2: Historical Background
being used against them by Indians. The significance of this pivotal event can be
boiled down to a single statement: the Mission San Sabá episode shattered the
Spaniards’ illusions of their own invincibility. After that fateful day, they no longer
could assume military superiority over the Native peoples in Texas.
CAUSES OF THE NORTEÑO ATTACK ON
MISSION SAN SABÁ
Dunn (1914:413–414) outlines three causes for the attack on Mission San
Sabá. The first was the Norteños’ hatred for the Apaches and their Spanish allies.
Dunn refers to their hatred as “ jealousy inspired not by affection, but by fear.” He
also notes that “The establishment of the presidio upon the San Saba River had from
the first been regarded by the Comanche and their allies as a virtual declaration
of war against themselves, and they believed that eventually the Apaches would
induce the soldiers to aid them in a great campaign” (Dunn 1914:413). The second
cause was the perceived instigation of the attack by the French. The Spanish firmly
believed that by providing the Indians with firearms, the French had indirectly
encouraged the Indians to attack them. Many Spaniards believed that “the French
had encouraged the Indians by their presence at the massacre.” Of course, the French
denied this accusation, but the Spanish position was solidified when “horses and
mules stolen from San Sabá were said to be in the French fort at Natchitoches, and
many of the mission ornaments were said to have found their way into the hands
of the French” (Dunn 1914:414). The third cause for the attack was the Indians’
natural desire to plunder, augmented with the idea that obtaining food was also an
incentive (Dunn 1914:414).
Of the three reasons stated above, Dunn (1914:414) logically concludes that
the first was the main cause. It is easy to look back from a safe distance of more than
250 years and see how the Norteños hatred for the Apaches sealed the fate of the
San Sabá effort. But the Spaniards involved, including the church and the military,
did not possess this critical piece of knowledge. The eyewitness testimonies seem to
indicate that the Spanish learned this lesson for the first time during the mission
attack. They learned that the Norteños had come to Mission San Sabá with the
intent of finding and killing Apaches, and that the Norteños viewed the Spaniards
as harboring their enemies (Nathan and Simpson 1959:74, 87, 128). On the morning
of the attack, the Indians told Father Molina they had “no intention other than to
fight the Apaches, who had killed some of their people,” and Molina said “the enemy
had already declared their desire to kill Apaches” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:87).
Indeed, the Spanish seemed clueless as to their dangerous political misstep.
In her treatise on The Native Americans of the Edwards Plateau, 1582–1799, Wade
(2003:187) describes the situation in 1757 succinctly:
The Apache asked the Spanish soldiers to accompany them on the
buffalo hunt, and the Spanish complied (Dunn 1914:399). This was
a clear miscalculation on the part of the Spanish, who should have
realized that all the enemies of the Apache, including the Tejas,
would understand this as an affront. Not only would the soldiers
be perceived as protecting the Apache against their enemies (who
in some cases were friends of the Spanish), but it also amounted to

57

58

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
a declaration of friendship between the Spanish and Apache. Such
a symbolic act, after the recent attack by the Tejas on the Apache,
had to elicit a negative response. At issue is the assumption by
the Spaniards that they could be friends with everyone regardless
of Native internal enmities, as well as the political arrogance of
making new alliances without informing allies, especially when the
new alliances were made with bitter enemies. Such behavior would
not be tolerated in any political or military setting; why would it be
countenanced by Native Americans?
AFTERMATH OF THE MISSION SAN SABÁ ATTACK
The Punitive Expedition of 1759
Spanish relations with the Norteños were only worsened by their response
to the attack on the mission. While the Spanish were still reeling from the massacre,
Colonel Ortiz Parrilla sought revenge. At a Junta de Guerra y Hacienda (war
council) in June 1758, the Spanish decided that they should punish the northern
tribes. In a second junta held in January 1759, they planned to launch an attack,
specifically targeting the Taovayas villages on the Red River. The military campaign
was carried out a year and half later (Weddle 1964:118). As summarized by Wade
(2003:191–192), the punitive expedition led by Colonel Ortiz Parrilla left Presidio San
Sabá in late September 1759. It consisted of “442 Spaniards, mestizos, and ‘friendly’
Indians, plus the seven hundred Apaches” (Weddle 2007:13). They traveled until
they found a Yojuane village on the Brazos River. They attacked the village, killing
55 warriors and capturing 149 people. Most researchers identify the Yojuane as a
band of Wichita speakers who were related to and allied with the Tonkawa or were
themselves a band of Tonkawa (e.g., Bolton 1915:146; Gwynne 2010:68; Newcomb
1961:134; Prikryl 2001:64; Weddle 2007:26). Although Ortiz Parrilla reported that
these Indians possessed objects and horses taken from the mission and presidio at
San Sabá and that they were among those who participated in the massacre, unlike
the Norteños that attacked the mission, these Yojuane had only bows and arrows
and no guns (Weddle 2007:26). Given this armament and their probable affiliation
with the Tonkawa, this was probably a group of innocent Natives that had nothing
to do with the San Sabá massacre.
Following this battle, Ortiz Parrilla made the captured Yojuane lead them to
the Taovaya village on the Red River. The expedition continued northward, arriving
at the Taovaya and Iscani village on October 7, 1759. The Spaniards were attacked
by smaller groups who led them directly to a “coalition of groups” gathered at a large,
well-fortified village. The Spanish engaged the enemy in a battle on the Texas side
of the river, but they ultimately lost to the well-prepared and well-armed Native
force (Weddle 2007:29–34). “The battle tactics, bravery, and organization of the
Native warriors deserved and received high praise from Parrilla” (Wade 2003:192).
The Spaniards also were able to observe “the French flag flying from the center of
the stockade and the large number of huts that made up the populous village…
Behind the palisaded corrals that held the Indians’ horse herd could be seen the
tall tents of the Taovayas’s allies—identified as Comanches” (Weddle 2007:32).
Newcomb (1969:161) states that “Parrilla believed that there were Frenchmen
with the Wichitas, giving them assistance. But the presence of Frenchmen is to be

Chapter 2: Historical Background
seriously doubted, as is any significant tactical help on their part.” Regardless of
what others thought, Ortiz Parrilla documented many reasons why he believed the
French were deeply involved in the affair (Weddle 1964:130–132).
Most researchers and historians (e.g., Dunn 1914:414; Wade 2003:192;
Weddle 1964:129) have generally portrayed the 1759 military campaign against
the Norteños as a huge Spanish failure, and Ortiz Parrilla has been saddled with a
poor reputation as a military commander. Many believe that Ortiz Parrilla’s “retreat
turned into a rout as his poorly trained and demoralized men fled back through
the tangled brush and forest to their temporary camp” (Newcomb 1969:161). Such
views were commonly considered to be historical fact until recently. But Weddle’s
book, After the Massacre: The Violent Legacy of the San Sabá Mission (2007), paints
an entirely different picture of Ortiz Parrilla’s retaliatory expedition. He proposes
that Felipe de Rábago y Terán, well-documented as a man of poor character,
intentionally slandered Ortiz Parrilla’s campaign and basically rewrote history for
his own vengeful purposes. The idea popularized by Rábago y Terán is that Ortiz
Parrilla suffered an outright defeat at the hands of the Taovaya and made a rapid
retreat home in fear of being followed and attacked. Contrary to this scenario,
Weddle believes that Ortiz Parrilla skirmished with the Taovaya defenders, but
upon reaching the Red River, he examined the impressive fortification and enemy’s
overall military strength and wisely chose not to engage them in a major battle.
Rather than making a hasty retreat, Ortiz Parrilla calmly returned to Presidio San
Sabá, marching the expedition back at the same pace as their march northward.
His intention was to return to his post and plan a better attack.
This new interpretation is supported by the discovery, translation, and
analysis of a previously unknown Spanish document: the diary of Juan Ángel de
Oyarzún, a captain who accompanied the expedition (Weddle 2007:xv–xviii). It
presents the military campaign in an entirely new light and calls into question the
spiteful actions of Felipe de Rábago y Terán, the man who replaced Ortiz Parrilla as
commander of Presidio San Sabá. This new data does clarify some important details
about the event and the people involved, but Newcomb (1969:161) was essentially
correct when he noted: “In a tactical sense, the battle was almost a standoff in that
neither side won a clear-cut victory. But in broader perspective it was a decisive
Spanish defeat as it marked the end of Spanish expansion and domination in Texas.”
The 1759 Red River military campaign is interesting from a sociological
standpoint. The Spanish believed that the Comanche and the Taovaya were the
key groups in the Norteño coalition, having observed a prominent chief or captain
leading each group. But the Spanish did not pursue the Comanche and instead chose
to go after the Taovaya on the Red River. Why? First, the Spanish were hoping to
strike at the heart of the Norteño alliance and disrupt the French trade network
operating within their northern frontier. The “Spaniards always seemed to govern
their actions by what the French did, or what they feared they might do” (Weddle
1964:132), and Ortiz Parrilla firmly believed the French were instigating and
supporting the Norteño hostilities. And second, it made better strategic sense to go
after a group of enemies concentrated in a known village than to strike out after a
nomadic group whose whereabouts were unknown.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Presidio San Sabá and the El Cañon Missions, 1759–1771
Although the Spanish presence in the northern frontier had been dealt two
mortal blows, they continued to hold on in the San Saba region for more than a
decade. Presidio San Sabá continued to operate as an isolated military post for 14
years after the attack on Mission San Sabá. During this time, the last two missions in
central Texas—San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria
del Cañon—were established nearby in the upper Nueces River basin. Referred to
as the El Cañon missions, they were established in 1762 to serve several different
bands of Apache (Bolton 1915:94; Chipman 1992:175–176, 2010a, 2010b; Newcomb
1969:165–176). Being clustered together yet isolated on the northern frontier, the
histories of Presidio San Sabá and the El Cañon missions are intimately intertwined,
as noted by Newcomb (1969), Wade (2003:1184–2030), Walter et al. (2003:1–9), and
Weddle (1964:156–183).
Captain Rábago y Terán, then commander at Presidio San Sabá, went to
great efforts and personal expense to help establish the two El Cañon missions. But
they struggled constantly because “they were not officially sanctioned and never
given adequate support” (Newcomb 1969:176). “For eight years the mission effort on
the upper Nueces was maintained without official approval or aid, at no expense to
the royal treasury” (Weddle 1964:162). But Wade (2003:194) notes that the Apache
never intended to settle at the El Cañon missions, and Mission San Lorenzo was
never much more than “a way-station for a great number of Apache who came and
went as they pleased.”
Throughout their existence, Presidio San Sabá and the El Cañon missions
were constantly threatened by attacks from the Norteños. The situation got worse
each year, and Mission San Lorenzo was attacked twice in the fall of 1766. By the
spring of 1767, Presidio San Sabá was “virtually under siege,” and soldiers were
regularly attacked when they ventured outside the fort to hunt or escort supply
trains (Newcomb 1969:173). “The frequency and persistence of these attacks left
no doubt that the northern groups, as well as the Tejas and their allies, would not
tolerate the Spanish support of the Apache, nor the presence of a presidio or mission
in the area” (Wade 2003:199). By 1766, the Apaches had left Mission Candelaria,
and it was essentially abandoned by the Spanish by 1767 (Wade 2003:200; Weddle
1964:167). The second El Cañon mission, San Lorenzo, was unofficially abandoned
in 1768, with formal abandonment by 1771, and Presidio San Sabá was abandoned
the same year (Chipman 2010a; Newcomb 1969:175; Wade 2003:203). In 1772,
the College of Santa Cruz de Querétaro voluntarily relinquished their missions to
the College of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Zacatecas, thereby leaving Texas
altogether (Bolton 1915:108).
The End Game
With Presidio San Sabá and the two El Cañon missions being abandoned by
1771, the Spanish gave up their hopes of Christianizing the Apaches or sustaining
settlements in the northern frontier (Chipman 1992:179; Newcomb 1969:176).
Historians have speculated about why the Spanish sought to maintain a presence

Chapter 2: Historical Background
in the far reaches of the Texas frontier in the 1760s, especially in light of the fact
that the San Sabá and El Cañon locations were failures at bringing in Apache
converts. The real reasons for maintaining these outposts were political and
military rather than religous. During the 1760s, the Spanish wanted a military
presence at the edge of the Comancheria as a show of force and to keep an eye on
this powerful new enemy, they wanted to keep watch on the French interactions
with the Comanches and other northern tribes, and they sought a political alliance
with the Apaches (Chipman 1992:173–181; Newcomb 1969:174–176; Tunnell and
Newcomb 1969:184–185). The Spanish had to face some harsh realities by the late
1760s, however. The Comanche were becoming increasingly powerful, the Apaches
were becoming less powerful, and the Spanish Crown was not prepared to commit
more resources toward a failing effort. The closing of these frontier outposts was
based on the recommendations made by the Marqués de Rubí, who made a three-year
inspection tour of all the presidios in the northern frontier of New Spain (Chipman
1992:173–181). In the summer of 1767, he visited Presidio San Sabá and the two
El Cañon missions, and his official reviews to the King of Spain were not favorable.
He declared the Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas “to be the worst presidio in the
entire kingdom of New Spain” (Chipman 1992:173), Candelaria was a poor excuse
for a mission and was already abandoned (Newcomb 1969:174), and the mission at
San Lorenzo was little more than a “way station” between the Rio Grande and the
presidio at San Sabá (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969:184).
By the last quarter of the eighteenth century, the Spanish had realized that
their attempts to convert the Apache in Texas had failed and that further efforts
would be futile. They were also somewhat more attuned to the complex social realities
in the northern frontier. The Spaniards were interested in making peace with the
powerful Comanche nation, and they realized that making the Apaches their mutual
enemy would foster alliances with the Comanche. In fact, the Marqués de Rubí
realized the serious problems that the Comanches were causing at San Sabá and El
Cañon, having seen firsthand that the Spaniards had lost control (Wade 2003:199–
202). Rubí even went as far as to suggest “that amicable relations be established with
the powerful Comanches and their allies, and that the Apaches be exterminated by
the combined might of the Spaniards and the Comanches” (Newcomb 1969:176). But
the Spanish and Comanche alliances would remain temporary and precarious as
the Spanish tried to understand and manage the rapidly changing social landscape
(Newcomb 1969:176; Wade 2003:205–214).

CHAPTER 3: ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Jennifer K. McWilliams and Douglas K. Boyd

OVERVIEW OF SPANISH COLONIAL
ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS
Texans have been interested in our own history and past cultures since the
first immigrants began exploring and settling the lands that now make up the state.
From the early conservation efforts before the turn of the century to the passage of
cultural resources laws, which led to many site investigations in the latter half of the
twentieth century, Texans have made great progress in preserving and protecting
historic sites, researching our history, and protecting and salvaging the archeology
of our Spanish heritage. The investigations of Spanish colonial sites in Texas have
produced a wealth of historical and archeological data that can be used to address
a wide range of research issues such as those suggested by Graham (1998).
This section provides a brief review of the history of archeological
investigations at Spanish occupation sites in what were the Spanish states of
Coahuila, Texas, and Nuevo Santander and are now the eastern two-thirds of Texas.
The area of west Texas that occupied the Spanish states of Nueva Mexico and Nueva
Vizcaya (see Figures 2.1 and 2.2) are excluded from this overview.
In the process of examining the literature on Spanish colonial archeology
for the San Sabá material culture analysis, it was helpful to compile site data and
references into a tabular format, and this information is presented in Table 3.1. While
this table is not an exhaustive list of investigations at relevant sites in the eastern
two-thirds of Texas, it does include the most important sites and publications. For
convenience, the Table 3.1 listings are grouped into the following geographic areas:
central, coastal, east, Rio Grande, and San Antonio area.
The earliest investigations at Texas missions focused on preservation,
conservation, and reconstruction. In the 1860s, Father Francis Bouchu, sometimes
called the first preservationist in Texas, began a reconstruction of Mission Espada
in San Antonio. He recorded all of the standing structures and documented the
still-visible painted frescos (Guerra 1982:29; Habig 1968:225–226). Bouchu’s work
set the stage for many similar conservation and restoration projects in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
In 1887 Adina De Zavala, an early preservationist and granddaughter of the
first vice-president of the Republic of Texas, founded the first conservation group in
Texas. The Texas Historical and Landmarks Association focused on the preservation
and reconstruction of Spanish colonial ruins in San Antonio, especially the Alamo,

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
but its interests encompassed projects throughout the state. Additional conservation
work was conducted at Mission San José from 1911 to 1918 with the help of De Zavala
and the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. The San Antonio Conservation Society
and the Works Project Administration continued the conservation and restoration
efforts at Mission San José (Handbook of Texas Online 2010b). In 1941, the mission
was designated a state and national historic site—the first Spanish colonial site
in Texas to be so designated (Cruz 2010b; De Zavala and Donecker 2010; Guerra
1982). Mission San José and three other missions in San Antonio were transferred
to the National Park Service in 1978, becoming the San Antonio Missions National
Historic Park (Cruz 2010a, 2010b).
The extensive works of the depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps
focused on reconstruction, and archeological investigations were primarily geared
toward the retrieval of architectural information. In addition to the work at Mission
San José, reconstruction efforts were carried out at Presidio San Sabá in Menard
County and Mission Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga and Rosario in Goliad County.
Archeological recordkeeping, analysis, and report publication were not emphasized.
The earliest publication with a significant archeological analysis component may
be Erik Reed’s analysis of the burials excavated by the WPA at Mission Espíritu
Santo, mentioned by Hendrickson (2010).
The 1960s saw the first systematic archeological work on Spanish sites
in Texas. In 1962, with the financial help of the Research Institute and the Texas
Memorial Museum at the University of Texas at Austin, Curtis Tunnell and W. W.
Newcomb investigated Mission San Lorenzo de Santa Cruz (1762–1772) in Camp
Wood, Real County. As the field of historic archeology was blossoming in the United
States, they were among the first to merge archival resources with archeology in
a joint archeological-ethnohistorical investigation. Tunnell and Newcomb (1969:ii)
proudly outlined the benefits in the opening comments in their report:
On the one hand, we likely would find the adobe brick, the potsherd,
and the glass bead; on the other, the written word of the men who
laid the brick, broke the pot, and buried the Indian who wore the
bead. Surely these different kinds of data could be put together in
such a manner as to recreate the past more fully and efficiently then
had ever been done before, at least so far as missions established by
the Spanish for Texas Indians were concerned.
The 1960s also brought the passage of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 and the first annual meeting of the Society for Historical Archeology,
which was held in Dallas in 1967. The former provided protection for archeological
sites and established a process to evaluate cultural resources on federal lands and
in federal projects (Gilmore 2010e). At the state level in the 1960s, the archeology
program of the State Building Commission and the Texas State Historical Survey
Committee, precursors to the Texas Historical Commission, became interested in
Spanish colonial sites (Latimer and Jasinski 2010). The new state historical marker
program also spurred research and interest. Archeological work was conducted at
Presidio San Agustín de Ahumada in Chambers County (Tunnell and Ambler 1967),
Mission San Juan Capistrano and the Alamo in Bexar County (Greer 1967; Schuetz

Chapter 3: Archeological Background
1968, 1969; Tunnell 1966), and Presidio San Sabá in Menard County (Gilmore
1967). The work also included Kathleen Gilmore’s archival research and searches
for the lost missions at San Xavier in Milam County (Gilmore 1969) and on the
San Saba River (Gilmore 1967). Although Gilmore’s search for Mission San Sabá
was unsuccessful, her research and the increased attention on this mission were
important steps along the road leading to the eventual rediscovery of the mission
site in 1993 (Hindes and Wolf 1995:4).
Since these pioneering efforts, numerous agencies, universities, archeology
societies, and cultural resource management firms have played leading roles in
the investigation of Spanish colonial sites in Texas, including intensive historical
research and major excavations. These projects have focused on mission and
presidio sites to some extent, but they also include investigations of ranchos, villas,
and acequia systems. The Texas Department of Transportation, Texas Historical
Commission, and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department have conducted or funded
numerous projects involving Spanish colonial archeology. Stephen F. Austin
University supported the work at Mission Dolores de los Ais in San Augustine
County, and Texas Tech University (TTU) supported work at Mission San Sabá in
Menard County. The Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at the University of
Texas at San Antonio has conducted many investigations at the various San Antonio
missions and related Spanish sites, including the Rancho de las Cabras site. The
Texas Archeological Society participated in the search for the San Xavier missions
in the 1980s and played a major role in the investigations at Presidio San Sabá in
the 1990s. Additionally, regional archeology groups have assisted in surveys, site
recording, and testing. The Texas Historical Commission (2009) has been working
with local volunteers to document the San Xavier missions near Rockdale. A unique
opportunity to look at Spanish colonial sites emerged in the 1990s when Falcón
Reservoir dried up to the point that looters were accessing and pillaging archeological
sites on the shoreline. The Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University
of Texas at Austin teamed up with the Texas Historical Commission to record and
preserve many of these sites, including several ranchos.
HOW MISSION SAN SABÁ WAS LOST
During 100 years of archeological work at Spanish colonial sites in Texas,
why was Mission San Sabá never investigated? The answer is simple. The mission
that played such an important role in Texas history was lost, its location faded away
in time and memory. One factor in this is that it was frequently confused with a
nearby site, Presidio San Sabá, in written sources. Presidio San Sabá and Mission
San Sabá stood 4 miles apart. The large masonry ruins at the golf course about 1
mile west of Menard are the remains of the presidio, much of them from a 1937
reconstruction of the Spanish fort. In contrast, a lone historical marker standing
in an alfalfa field about 3 miles east of the town is the only thing that marks where
the mission once stood. It is easy to drive past the site and never know that the
events that occurred there in 1757–1758 changed the course of Texas history. It is
important to examine the causes of this confusion because this is a significant part
of the story of how Mission San Sabá became lost.

75

76

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
While the mission site has been largely unrecognizable for more than
century, the presidio has long been an important icon for the people of Menard. Its
towering rock façade, much of it reconstructed from rubble by the Texas Centennial
Commission in 1937 (Walter et al. 2003:6), stands at the west edge of town. Few
people in the community can remember the rubble remains of the presidio prior to
the 1937 reconstruction. The original entryway arch was still intact at that time, but
the rest of the presidio compound was reduced to collapsed and partially collapsed
rock walls. The massive ruins, covering approximately 3 acres, were a testament to
the extensive Spanish building efforts. Beginning as early as the 1850s, the stones
from the presidio were collected by the cartload for the construction of buildings in
and around Menard and to build a fence around the cemetery (Hunter 1905:34–35;
Walter et al. 2003:6). The presidio ruins have recently undergone another restoration
that was completed in 2011. This work was overseen by the Presidio de San Saba
Restoration Corporation of Menard, which received $1,000,000 of federal stimulus
money in 2010 to help with the restoration plans (Texas Historical Commission
2010:14, 21).
Citizens of Menard still talk about events that happened at the “mission”
in their lifetimes. Many people who grew up there can recall stories of high school
pranks or budding romances that took place within the “mission” walls. What they
are actually referring to is the presidio. The presidio ruins have long been a popular
spot for picnics and other social gatherings, where people would sit their children or
grandchildren on their knees and tell tales of Spanish exploits and violent Indian
attacks—some true, some embellished, and some pure hogwash.
Many of the older folks in Menard remember the Texas centennial celebration
held at the presidio in 1937. The celebration was held a year late, reportedly in
keeping with the rogue rules of the “Free State of Menard,” which was more a
defiant attitude than a political reality (Pierce 1946). During the event, the local
movie theater operator staged a reenactment of the “mission massacre.” White men
dressed up as Indians and “attacked” the local citizens, who ran to the safety of the
“mission” for protection. A panoramic photograph taken at the time shows hundreds
of people gathered at the reconstructed ruins, including the actors in Indian and
Spanish costumes.36
The Menard Country Club is a nine-hole golf course built in the 1930s on the
presidio grounds (Walter et al. 2003:6). The stone ruins are certainly a picturesque
backdrop for a round of golf, but most who play the “presidio” course think the ruins
are those of Mission San Sabá. Even the 2003 edition of The Texas Golf Bible states
that the “Presidio Golf Club” in Menard “rolls along the San Saba River and is named
after the old Spanish Mission on the back side of the course” (Stone 2003:268). The
myth of the presidio-mission is so deeply entrenched in local folklore that many

The large-format (1x3-ft) photograph was taken in 1937 by N. H. Rose. It was reprinted in 2007
as part of Menard’s 250-year anniversary celebration of the founding of Mission Santa Cruz de
San Sabá and Presidio Sabá (1757–2007). The photo caption reads: “In 1937, Menard residents
staged a pageant depicting ‘the fall of the Presidio de San Luis de Las Amarillas–the San Saba
Mission’ and posed for this photograph in front of the Presidio which was partially reconstructed
in 1936 as part of the Texas Centennial program.”
36

Chapter 3: Archeological Background
well-educated and historically minded citizens of Menard still refer to the presidio
ruins as “the mission.”
Further evidence of the tenacity of the presidio-mission myth comes from
a reputable source, the United States Geological Survey. The 1987 version of the
USGS 7.5-minute Menard quadrangle (1970, photo-revised 1987) labels the presidio
as “San Saba Mission.” This error only underscores the fact that the mapmakers
never questioned the identification of the location as the mission ruins.
Why do many people in Menard County still believe the presidio ruins
west of town are the remains of the Mission San Sabá? The answer can be found
in the history books and oral folklore of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Mixing the identities of the presidio and mission sites may have begun
with a German visitor in the mid-nineteenth century. Ferdinand von Roemer, a
well-published and well-traveled naturalist and geologist from Germany, came
through Menard County and visited the presidio ruins on February 18, 1847. After
describing the ruins, Roemer wrote:
The plan of the whole structure is, in its main features, the same
as that of the Spanish missions near San Antonio; but the church,
which, in harmony with its religious purpose, the conversion of
the Indians, is the largest and most notable building in the larger
California missions, as well as in those of San Antonio, was here
either entirely wanting, or was only very small and insignificant.
Neither is there any indication that the land around the fort
was ever cultivated, nor is there any trace of an aqueduct for the
irrigation of the land, which is never missing in the other missions.
Both circumstances arouse many doubts as to whether this was
really a mission. It was perhaps nothing more than a strong point
for guarding the San Saba valley. Of the ultimate fate of this fort
little more than tradition is known in Texas. It is said to have been
besieged by Comanches in the last quarter of the last century, the
Spanish garrison, starved into submission, was massacred, and
the building destroyed. Undoubtedly documents from which a
conclusion as to the facts may be drawn are to be found in Mexico.
(Roemer [1849] as cited in Looscan [1901:138])37
Roemer was undoubtedly talking about the massive masonry ruins of the
presidio, but his description implies that people were already confusing many of the
facts regarding the presidio and the mission. Roemer recognized an unexplained
discrepancy when he noted that the ruins were missing an essential element integral
to any mission: the church. Although Roemer asked the right question when he
wondered whether the ruins were actually a defensive structure, he mixed many
key historical aspects of the mission and the presidio. The notion that the presidio
and mission were one in the same was already firmly planted before Roemer visited
the presidio in 1847. While most of Roemer’s words were technically correct, his
reporting did nothing to dispel the myth.

Looscan provided this translation from the original German book Texas by Ferdinand von
Roemer, published in Germany in 1849.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
In the April 5, 1866, edition of The Cultivator and Country Gentleman, an
anonymous author wrote:
That the climate of Western Texas has been dry for more than
a century, is evident from the ruins of ditches and conduits for
irrigating, still to be seen at the old Spanish Fort and Mission of
San Saba, in Menard county, which is said to have been occupied
more than two hundred years ago. (Anonymous 1866)
This author appears to have repeated the popular misconception that the presidio
and mission were at the same location.
Around the turn of the century, a Menard County judge with an intimate
knowledge of the surrounding area introduced another error based on a
popular misconception. In 1901, Judge J. J. Callan drew a map for historian and
conservationist Adina De Zavala, who hoped to save Spanish missions around the
state. Judge Callan’s map (Figure 3.1) shows the presidio correctly placed just west
of the town of “Menardville” and correctly labeled “Ft. San Saba.” Out east of town
near a bend in the San Saba River, Callan placed a dot and labeled it “Presidio.
Smelter.” Apparently he knew something Spanish was there, he just didn’t know
what it was. Although the map is not very accurate and has no scale, the “presidio”
label marks the general location of the actual mission site. The idea that it was a
smelter goes back to the myths of Spanish silver mining near San Sabá.
In 1905, newspaperman John Warren Hunter published a booklet called Rise
and Fall of Mission San Saba, to which is Appended A Brief History of the Bowie
or Almagres Mine, also A Sketch of Summerland and Its Builders. Hunter’s (1905,
1935) book was produced as a souvenir and given out at a reunion of Confederate
veterans in Menardville in July 1905. Because Hunter was a local newspaperman,
many people probably viewed him as a credible historical authority. Bolton (1906:226)
noted that the book was the most comprehensive story of Mission San Sabá ever
published in English, but it was fraught with errors. As a result, it was largely
discounted in Bolton’s (1906:226) review and by subsequent historians. Bolton railed
against Hunter for not citing his sources and noted that Hunter took statements
verbatim from Bonilla and Bancroft.38 Bolton credits Hunter with “supplementing
his writing with valuable and detailed information,” but notes that Hunter’s “essay
contains some contradictory statements of fact that are puzzling” (Bolton 1906:226).
Hunter was a local newspaperman interested in history who lived in Menard
at the turn of the century. Given this isolation, his access to original documents and
accurate historical information was limited. Since the idea that the original mission
and the presidio were at the same location was already in place well before 1905,
Hunter was only repeating something that was common (albeit incorrect) knowledge
when he provided a map of the presidio ruins and labeled it “Plan of the Mission
San Saba.” He went on to discuss his belief that the original mission was within
the presidio, and that a later second mission was “erected four and one-half miles
below on the south bank of the river” (Hunter 1905:31–32). He said that he had “just
Hunter (1905:69) uses several paragraphs verbatim from Looscan (1901:137) without crediting
his source. This habit of plagiarizing earlier works without proper credit, especially those of Bonilla
and Bancroft, was continued in many subsequent publications about San Sabá up through the
1960s.

grounds for the belief that the Mission San Saba was founded many years earlier,”
meaning before the generally accepted founding date of 1757 (Hunter 1905:31). He
provided no sources for either of these claims, however.
Unfortunately, the booklet’s problems led historians to discount an important
clue to the mission’s location. In a footnote, Hunter stated that the mission site was
on the “Hockensmith place” and that “even today fragment of pottery and other
article may be found about the premises” (Hunter 1905:21). Thirty-two years later,
his son J. Marvin Hunter (1937:487) wrote: “Some forty years ago this writer visited
the former site of this mission, about three and one half miles below the present
town of Menard. It was on what was then known as the Peter Hockensmith place,
just below the old William Waller farm. Even at that late date there were traces of
the wooden fort remaining.” Despite the scholarly flaws, it was Hunter’s (1905:21)
simple statement about the Hockensmith place that allowed historian Kay Hindes
eventually to identify the property where the mission was located.
OTHER MYTHS ABOUT SAN SABÁ
The myths about Mission San Sabá altered peoples’ perceptions about the
site, and they are an important part of the story leading up to the rediscovery and
archeological investigations. Two other popular myths can be traced to Hunter’s
Rise and Fall of Mission San Saba. One is the story of a lost silver mine in the
area, and the other claims the existence of an escape tunnel at the presidio. These
two ideas probably did not originate with Hunter, but his publication certainly
popularized them.
Perhaps the most common and perplexing myth about the Spanish occupation
on the San Saba River relates to Spanish mining and lost silver mines at or near the
mission or presidio. In an article on Spanish colonial mining in Llano County, Caran
(2000:10) states that: “In 1829, Stephen F. Austin, the Father of Texas, published a
map showing a silver mine at the mission site. This entirely mythical mine became
known as the Lost San Saba Mine.” This would suggest that the idea of a Spanish
mine near Mission San Sabá has deep roots, but Mayo (1995:109–110) speculates
that the fictitious San Saba mine was a distortion of the facts regarding the real
Los Almagres mine, which was likely in Llano County (Caran 2000; Caran et al.
2000). The story is further obfuscated with attempts by frontiersman Jim Bowie to
find the Los Almagres mine, which eventually led to the tales of the fabled Bowie
silver mine (Brady 2000; Caran 2000; Mayo 1995; Hunter 1905:53).
Hunter (1905:53) believed that Jim Bowie had found the original Los
Almagres mine and that it was on the San Saba River near the mission (i.e., the
presidio) (see Bolton 1906:226). In fact, all three mine names—Los Almagres, Bowie,
and San Saba—have been thoroughly confused in the literature by the retelling and
embellishment of inaccurate stories. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century attempts
at mining in the region have spurred legends of their own, making the search for
the real Los Almagres mine more difficult (Caran et al. 2000; Mayo 1995). Many of
these stories may have been spread by unscrupulous people seeking to sell claims
or otherwise dupe unwary investors.

Chapter 3: Archeological Background
Evidence that the myth of a silver mine at Mission San Sabá was widespread
is found in Texas history books before 1900. An 1897 book called Under Six Flags:
The Story of Texas (Davis 1897:20, 25) contains many misstatements such as:
The Mission of San Saba was built in 1734, on the San Saba River
in what is now Menard County. The good fathers were at first very
successful in converting the Apaches and Comanches, who flocked
to them in great numbers. But the reopening of the Las Almagras
(red ores), an old silver mine near the mission, brought into the
neighborhood many reckless men; and quarrels soon arose between
them and the Indians—quarrels which were one day to bear bitter
fruit…
…A number of years later (1752), after a fresh quarrel with the
miners at Las Almagras, they [the Indios bravos] fell upon the
Mission of San Saba, and butchered every human creature within
its walls.
Similar historical inaccuracies were made in The Life and Writings of Rufus C.
Burleson, published in 1901. In a discussion of Spanish missions in Texas, Burleson
(1901:757) wrote: “San Saba, near a rock silver mine, was established in 1739, but
the Comanches, disgusted with the exactions of their spiritual fathers, murdered
the whole of them…in 1758.”
Even today, the legends of lost silver mines at San Sabá abound. The stories
of mining are so intimately tied to the presidio-mission that the citizens of Menard
used to host an annual musical drama called the Song of Silver in conjunction with
Jim Bowie Days.39
Legends aside, legitimate searches for the archeological remains of Los
Almagres and other Spanish colonial mines in central Texas have been made. Nancy
Mayo conducted extensive studies of several historic mines in Llano County (Mayo
1995). She found many historic mines but could not provide conclusive evidence that
any of them were Spanish. More recent studies by Christopher Caran did locate
several early historic mines that may well be part of the Los Almagres group of
Spanish mines (Caran 2000; Caran et al. 2000).
The other legend associated with the presidio, and by default with Mission
San Sabá, is that of the underground tunnel. When John Warren Hunter published
his souvenir booklet in 1905, he included a map of the presidio but labeled it: “Plan of
the Mission San Saba.” The map shows an “Entrance to tunnel to the river” (Hunter
1905:frontpiece illustration). In the text, Hunter wrote that the Spanish garrison was
“secure” in part because of “a subterranean passage having been constructed leading
from the main patio to the river” (Hunter 1905:38). It is not clear where Hunter got
The Song of Silver musical was reported to be a historical account of Jim Bowie’s search for
the lost Spanish Silver mine. Written in 1988, it was produced for many years in conjunction
with the local Jim Bowie Days celebration in Menard. The Menard Chamber of Commerce (2001)
advertised it as a “rousing musical written by playwright Patty Miller set in a breathtaking
canyon amphitheater called Silver Ridge. There, every third week-end in June, over 100 actors,
singers, dancers, musicians, and technicians re-enact the incredible legend. Netting rave reviews,
the musical includes original music, battles, comedy, pathos, weddings, waltzers, gamblers, fire
dancers, folklorico dancers, saloon girls, cafe biddies, Indian ceremonies, explosions, massacres,
horseback stunts, prospectors, lovers, rainmakers and dreams!”

this notion, but it must have been discussed and handed down by word of mouth.
It continues to be repeated today: during the presidio archeological investigations
by Texas Tech University and the Texas Archeological Society, visitors often asked
the archeologists if they had found the tunnel yet.
HOW MISSION SAN SABÁ WAS FOUND
While the idea that Mission San Sabá was a separate location from the
presidio may have eluded many people over the years, many twentieth-century
historians and archeologists were well aware of this fact. For them, the mystery
was about where the mission actually was. Kathleen Gilmore is credited with the
first serious attempt to find it. Hindes and Wolf (1995:4) note:
The first attempt to use a multidisciplinary approach to discover
the mission site and document the original features of the presidio
was made by Gilmore (1967). This study failed to find the mission,
but translations of Spanish Documents and other research greatly
increased our knowledge of circumstances of site selection, material
culture, and significant architectural data concerning the mission
and presidio.
In 1985, San Antonio architect Bruce Johnson and friend Tony Weissgarber
compiled aerial photographs of the land east of the presidio and conducted groundtruthing surveys to locate the mission. When they did not find any Spanish artifacts,
they concluded that the site had been destroyed by agricultural practices. However,
Johnson knew that the mission was 3.94 miles from the presidio, and he conducted
test excavations just north of the actual mission location (unpublished notes in
personal files of Mark Wolf and Kay Hindes; see Hindes et al. 1995:5).
In 1990, Texas A&M University researchers conducted an archeological
survey in the San Saba River valley east of Menard specifically to search for the
location of the mission. Directed by Dr. Shawn Carlson (1991), this survey failed to
find remains of the mission, but the geomorphological work by Schlenker (1991) did
further knowledge of the dynamic nature of the San Saba River. The investigations
suggested that the mission site was probably buried by flood deposits (Carlson
1991:79–83).
Interest in finding the lost mission grew, and historians Kay Hindes and
Mark Wolf embarked on a project to find it in 1993. After pouring over documents
and maps, they contacted Texas Tech University anthropology professor Grant Hall,
who agreed to help in an archeological search. Hindes had found Hunter’s (1905)
reference to the mission being on the Hockensmith place, and subsequent deed
research showed that this property was now owned by Menard County Judge Otis
Lyckman. Thus, the investigators narrowed the search area from a large section of
the river valley east of Menard to a specific property along FM 2092.
Kay Hindes, Mark and Kim Wolf, and Grant Hall found Mission San Sabá
on the afternoon of September 4, 1993 (Hindes et al. 1995:1).40 The team drove to
The interesting story of the archival research and archeological search that led to the finding
of Mission San Sabá is detailed by Hindes and Wolf (1995) in the report on the initial Texas Tech

Chapter 3: Archeological Background
the Lyckman property about 4 miles east of Menard. The field, normally planted in
alfalfa, had fortuitously been deep plowed only days before. They got permission to
look in the field, and within minutes Hindes yelled out, “This is what we’re looking
for!” The fragment of olive jar in her hand was the first artifactual evidence that
this was the long-lost mission site. They continued to find more material evidence
until they were convinced that this was the mission site.
TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY ARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS
Following the discovery, Texas Tech University conducted more-comprehensive
archeological testing in early 1994 (Hall 1994; Hindes et al. 1995). The work began
with a ground-penetrating radar survey on December 19–21, 1993. The horizontal
extent of this survey was based primarily on the observed surface distributions
of burned daub and artifacts. This work was followed by a metal detector survey
on January 8–9, 1994. This survey covered roughly 20 percent of the total area of
Lyckman’s field and identified 124 Spanish colonial artifacts.
In January and May of that year Texas Tech performed a series of test
excavations across the alfalfa field that included digging three long, shallow backhoe
trenches to search for features (Figure 3.2). Several site maps in the report (Hindes
et al. 1995:Figures 4, 5, and 6) show the locations of these investigations, and one
of those maps is reproduced here (Figure 3.3). The artifacts and features found
provided indisputable evidence that this was the location of the mission.

Texas Tech conducted more archeological investigations during a summer
field school in 1997, but the results have not been published. This phase of work
included more hand-excavated units, along with additional shallow backhoe trenches
and extensive machine blading to search for features.
Three master’s theses have been written using the Texas Tech data—all by
participants in the 1997 field school. In 2000, Richard Cavallin-Cosma, an architecture
graduate student, completed a hypothetical reconstruction of the mission based
on a spatial analysis of the features documented during the investigations from
1993 to 1997 (Cavallin-Cosma 2000). In this work, he presents maps showing the
distributions of postholes and other Spanish colonial features, from which he infers
the layout of the mission compound, including the stockade walls and structures
inside the enclosure. These maps would later prove to be a useful tool for planning
the archeological investigations reported here (see Chapter 4).
In 2001, Jennifer McWilliams, the senior author of this report, then
a graduate student in Texas Tech’s Anthropology, Sociology, and Social Work
Department, completed a study of the material culture recovered from the mission
excavations (McWilliams 2001). She examined and described the artifacts from the

85

1997 field school excavations and compared them with the document Inventory of
Supplies Purchased in Mexico for the Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá as translated
by Dennis (1995a). Chapter 14 is a reanalysis of the Inventory of Supplies that
expands upon this earlier study.
In 2009, Steven Schooler, then an anthropology graduate student at Texas
State University, completed a lead isotope analysis of musket balls and other lead
artifacts recovered from the mission. Schooler compared the Mission San Sabá
data with a database of known French and Spanish lead artifacts to identify the
geographic and cultural origins of the San Sabá lead. Building on this study, Schooler
conducted a lead isotope analysis of 21 additional lead artifacts recovered during
the testing and data recovery investigations reported in this volume (see Chapter 6).

CHAPTER 4: THE 2006–2007 INVESTIGATIONS
Jennifer K. McWilliams and Douglas K. Boyd

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has to comply with
federal and state laws as it builds and maintains roads across this vast state.
Within the agency, the Archeological Studies Program (within the Environmental
Affairs Division) has the task of overseeing compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act (federal law) and the Texas Antiquities Code (state law). Prewitt
and Associates, Inc. (PAI), is one of several cultural resources consultants who
conduct historical and archeological studies under contracts with TxDOT. When
the agency began the FM 2092 road-improvement project, they hired PAI to
conduct the cultural resources studies needed. Most road-building and roadimprovement projects are multiyear affairs, and the FM 2092 project was no
exception. The work was completed in three separate stages beginning in 2005.
This chapter summarizes the investigations. All of the field methods and work
described herein correspond with the scope of work approved by TxDOT and the
Texas Historical Commission, which is attached to Texas Antiquities Permit No.
4317. All of the areas investigated are within the Area of Potential Effect for this
road-improvement project.
A prefield phase 41 involved developing a work plan for the historical
research and archeological survey. This plan was approved by TxDOT and the
Texas Historical Commission, and the archeological survey of the FM 209242
roadway was initiated in the summer of 2006. In addition to survey, this project
included a geoarcheological assessment of this section of the San Saba River and
archival and informant research aimed at identifying historical resources such
as farmsteads and segments of the Spanish acequia. Dr. Mariah Wade reviewed
many Spanish colonial documents, and 10 were selected for further study (Wade
2006). This resulted in a publication that reproduced the 10 original documents
and presented full Spanish transcriptions and English translations (Wade 2007).
Data recovery excavations were conducted beginning in November 2006. This work
consisted of hand excavations of the mission-related deposits within the FM 2092
right of way, along with more historical research followed by detailed analysis of
the archeological and historical data.43

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
PHASE I: GEOARCHEOLOGY, ARCHIVAL
AND HISTORICAL RESOURCE REVIEW, AND SURVEY
Geoarcheological Assessment of the San Saba River Valley
On June 21, 2006, PAI personnel and TxDOT geoarcheologist Jim Abbott
made a field trip to examine landforms and discuss geomorphological interpretations
of the San Saba River valley. This visit had two goals. The first was to look at the
landforms and make a general evaluation of the geomorphic interpretations and
map of the valley compiled by Schlenker (1991) in conjunction with the Texas
A&M University survey by Carlson (1991). The second was to use the geomorphic
information to select locations along the FM 2092 route for backhoe trenching to
obtain geomorphic data or to search for buried archeological remains.
The pedestrian survey of FM 2092 was conducted in July 2006, along with
mechanical and hand excavations at the Mission San Sabá location. The backhoe
trenches excavated along the roadway were selected primarily to provide geomorphic
evidence pertaining to the San Saba River terraces. As reported by McWilliams
and Boyd (2008:21­–29, Figure 7), 13 trenches were within the FM 2092 right of
way, and 1 was on private land. Geological profile descriptions were presented in
an appendix by geoarcheologist Karl Kibler (McWilliams and Boyd 2008:Appendix
B). The trenches demonstrate that FM 2092 extends over late Holocene alluvial
terraces (T1) from Menard to Fivemile Crossing. The easternmost trench was about
200 m east of Fivemile Crossing (and immediately east of 41MN55), exposing late
Pleistocene deposits of the higher terrace (T2) in this stretch of the San Saba River
Valley (McWilliams and Boyd 2008:Figure 7).
Of the 14 backhoe trenches, only the 6 that are relevant Mission San Sabá
are discussed here. Table 4.1 presents geological profile descriptions for these, and
Table 4.2 gives the results of two radiocarbon assays on sediments from them.
Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show their locations.
Three trenches warrant mention here because they provided key evidence
that pertains to interpretations of the mission site. Backhoe Trenches 1–3 were
within and on either side of the swale at Harris Hollow (see Figure 4.1), a prominent
feature that runs down the valley from west to east roughly parallel to the San
Saba River. These trenches revealed evidence to address the question of whether
Harris Hollow might have been a flowing stream channel at the time of the mission
occupation in 1757–1758. Because of modern landscaping and extensive agricultural
pumping, Harris Hollow is now a broad grass-covered swale that holds running
water only during large rainfall events. But there are many stock ponds along Harris
Hollow, and local informants state that many of the pumps along the hollow tap
into a water table at a depth of only 15 ft.
Trench 1 was in the bottom of Harris Hollow, and Trenches 2 and 3 were
on the west and east sides of the swale. Trench 1 revealed a dense zone of channel
gravels (most fist-sized and smaller) at 158 cm below surface, overlain by fine-grained
alluvium with an AC-AB-B soil profile. Trenches 2 and 3 exposed fine-grained
alluvium with a similar soil profile, and Trench 2 also had channel gravels at 153 cm

below surface. These profiles indicate that Harris Hollow was once a former channel
of the San Saba River was later filled with ca. 1.5 m of fine-grained alluvium.
The overlying clay sediments appeared to be much older than a few hundred
years, so two soil humate samples were taken and sent to Beta Analytic, Inc., for
radiocarbon assay (see Table 4.2). Sample 1 was from Trench 1 in the bottom of the
hollow. It was collected at the base of the channel (gravel plug) at 138–148 cm below
surface, about 10 cm above the channel gravels. The assay resulted in a conventional
age of 2320±40 b.p. This indicates that abandonment of the channel and onset of
channel filling occurred about 2,300 years ago. Sample 2 was taken from Trench 2
inside but on the edge of Harris Hollow. This sample was collected from the buried
soil formed in a channel plug at 95–105 cm below surface. The assay resulted in a
conventional age of 1070±40 b.p. This indicates that infilling of the channel with
fine-grained sediment and the development of the soil within it was occurring
around 1,000 years ago.
Together, these dates confirm that Harris Hollow was abandoned as a river
channel long before the Spanish occupation of the area and that it is unlikely that
Harris Hollow could have served as a source of irrigation. Given the shallowness
of the water table in Harris Hollow today, however, it is possible that there were
springs along the hollow at the time and that water would have flowed and ponded
there for short periods after major rainfall events. Hall (1995:22) notes that Kissing
Springs once flowed “from the south bank of Harris Hollow near its confluence with
the San Saba,” just east of the mission site.
This has a direct bearing on finding the acequia that the Spanish were
digging near the mission, noting that the irrigation canal was not finished at the
time of the mission attack in spring 1758 (Weddle 1964:156). Since it now appears
that Harris Hollow was not a viable water source for an irrigation canal, it is likely
that the Spanish acequia tapped into the San Saba River. If this is true, the most
likely areas for the acequia and planned irrigated fields are somewhere to the
northwest of the mission or perhaps to the northeast of it just beyond the prominent
southward bend in the river. If the acequia came off the river somewhere northwest

at a point somewhere near it.
Backhoe Trenches 12 and 13 were in the FM 2092 right of way about 150
and 250 m east of Mission San Sabá. They were excavated at the point where a
prominent southward bend in the river comes closest to the roadway (see Figure
4.2). The excavations revealed late Holocene alluvial sediments identical to those
observed in the Gradall trenches in the mission site, but without any Spanish colonial

materials or historic and modern disturbances (other than the upper 16–29 cm of
artificial fill). These trenches are considered to be well outside the mission area.
In a further search for the acequia and fields associated with the mission,
one trench was excavated on private property, with the approval of TxDOT-ENV
and landowners Otis and Dionitia Lyckman. Backhoe Trench 14 was excavated
specifically to expose the stratigraphy of an abandoned irrigation lateral north of
Harris Hollow and about 275 m northwest of the mission (see Figure 4.2). It was
about 250 m north of FM 2092.

Chapter 4: The 2006–2007 Investigations
The old irrigation lateral is only a slight swale north of Harris Hollow, but
it can be traced easily for hundreds of meters across the pecan bottom of the San
Saba River valley (i.e., the late Holocene terrace). The lateral comes off of the main
Menard irrigation canal south of FM 2092. It runs northward and crosses under
FM 2092, and there was once a suspended metal flume where the lateral crossed over
Harris Hollow (Rambo 2006). Exactly when this irrigation lateral was abandoned is
not known, but the flume has been gone at least since the 1980s (Monte Lyckman,
personal communication 2006; Rambo 2006).
The general location for this trench was selected after consultation with Mark
Wolf and William Doolittle, who has done extensive work pertaining to prehistoric
and historic irrigation systems. Both agreed that this was a likely spot for the old
Spanish acequia and associated fields. Although we now know that this is not likely
(see Geoarcheological Assessment above), at the time it was hoped that a trench
might provide stratigraphic evidence showing that the abandoned irrigation lateral
followed the route of the acequia. The modern ditch is only about 2 m wide and 30
cm deep in this area, but it can be traced heading northward from Harris Hollow
and then turning to the northeast before it disappears at the north end of a cleared
field. The northeastern portion of the ditch empties out into the flat field area that
is just north of the mission.
Trench 14 was placed perpendicular to the north-south irrigation lateral
to crosscut the feature (Figure 4.3). The trench location was selected because the
ditch swale was well defined but the area was also open enough for the backhoe
to maneuver. At the trench location, the lateral swale was about 2.6 m wide and
about 30 cm deep. The excavated trench was 6 m long and oriented east-west to
completely crosscut this section of the lateral. The trench was up to 110 cm deep, and
the exposed profile revealed nothing but homogenous dark clayey sediments with
abundant evidence of bioturbation. There was essentially no discernible stratigraphy,
either natural or cultural, and no evidence of water-lain sediments inside the ditch
(i.e., sediment load dropped by irrigation water). Furthermore, the only evidence to
define the original ditch excavation was extremely subtle. The undisturbed sediments
below the ditch seemed to have slightly more calcium carbonate filaments than the
clayey sediments that had melted into the low swale forming the ditch. No evidence
was observed that might suggest the age of the ditch, nor was there any evidence
to suggest there had been multiple ditch bottoms (e.g., a modern ditch inside and
above an older ditch).
Examination of Trench 14 led to three main conclusions. First, it was
concluded that the upper meter of late Holocene deposits was extremely homogenous,
to the point that it would be difficult or impossible to identify any meaningful
stratigraphy associated with shallow irrigation ditches. One reason for this is that
abandoned ditches would have been filled in during floods with the same fine-grained
alluvial sediment as the alluvial deposits that they were dug into. Second, extensive
bioturbation has occurred throughout this area. The bioturbation appears to be
sufficient to obscure virtually all evidence of shallow ditches, a phenomenon that
would probably have happened within a few years of abandonment. Finally, it was
concluded that it will probably be difficult, if not impossible, to locate and identify

remnants of any original Spanish acequia associated with the 1757–1758 mission
anywhere on the late Holocene San Saba River terraces. This is partly the case
because the Spanish missionaries had started digging an acequia but apparently
never got to use it before the mission was destroyed (Nathan and Simpson 1959:48,
89, 92; Dennis 1995b:83, #36–37; Wade 2006:7, 2007:206).
Review of Historical Resources
After the geoarcheological assessment, extensive research was conducted to
review both published and unpublished works pertinent to the project. The objective
was to synthesize the existing historical information pertaining to the Spanish
colonial occupation and settlement in the San Saba River valley. The first part of this
work involved a review of easily available secondary historical data in the published
sources. These included published volumes on the general history of Mission San
Sabá, Menard County, and the San Saba region, sources covering the general
history of Spanish colonization in Texas and the Southwest, and archeological and
historical references pertaining to Mission San Sabá and other eighteenth-century
Spanish colonial sites in Texas. The second part of this work involved examining the
extensive research files compiled by historians Kay Hindes and Mark Wolf during
their many years of researching Mission San Sabá. Special attention was paid to
identifying comments—especially firsthand observations—that had relevance to
historic resources that were known to be, or might have been, present in or near
the FM 2092 project corridor. All relevant historical comments were compiled into a
tabulated format in the survey report (see McWilliams and Boyd 2008:Appendix A).
They were used to compile a list of actual or possible historical resource locations
to be examined in the field.
The prefield research identified 15 historic localities as precise or fairly
precise points along FM 2092 (McWilliams and Boyd 2008:Chapter 5). Each locality
was assigned a number and plotted on a modern aerial photograph. The resulting
map was used during the field survey to help guide placing auger tests, selecting
intensive survey locations, recording new sites, and plotting revised boundaries
for previously recorded sites. Some historic localities corresponded with previously
recorded archeological sites while others did not. Newly discovered historic localities
documented during this project included a small cemetery, a Texas Rangers’ camp,
historic homes and businesses, and old roads.
Translations of Spanish Colonial Documents
In the second part of the Phase I historical research, Spanish colonial historian
Mariah Wade reviewed over 150 documents in various central Texas archives
(primarily the Old Spanish Missions Historical Research Collection, St. Florence
Library Special Collections at Our Lady of the Lake University, San Antonio; and the
Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin). The documents,
which varied from 1 to 30 pages in length, were handwritten Spanish texts that had
never been fully transcribed or translated. Dr. Wade’s summary of the documents
(Wade 2006), which was submitted before fieldwork began in July 2006, highlighted
details of archeological interest in the mission area (i.e., she extracted pertinent

95

96

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
information pertaining to possible archeological remains that might be encountered).
These documents provided more clues about activities at the mission and along the
road to the presidio, but none of them contained sufficient location information to
pinpoint possible search areas or direct on-the-ground survey efforts.
Dr. Wade then produced full transcriptions and translations of 10 selected
documents, following the protocols established by the Arizona State Museum (2003)
and Barnes et al. (1981). She also wrote and introductory section and prepared a brief
historiography that describes what is known about the origin and historical context
of each document that she translated. The results of this work appear in Wade (2007).
History of the Menard Irrigation Company
PAI also conducted historical research and compiled a brief historical
overview of the Menard Irrigation Company (McWilliams and Boyd 2008:Chapter 3).
The Menard Irrigation Company’s irrigation system is recognized as an important
historic resource in the area, and a State of Texas subject marker describing “The
Ditch” was erected in Menard in 1972 (Texas Historical Commission 1972). The main
canal is recorded as 41MN21, and its location is widely known; it is depicted on the
USGS 7.5-minute Menard and Chapman Draw quadrangle maps. Many smaller
lateral ditches branch off the main canal, but these do not appear on any of the
irrigation system maps. This historic irrigation system was targeted for research and
field inspection because FM 2092 crosses portions of it in many places. McWilliams
and Boyd (2008:11–20, Figure 7) describe the history of the irrigation system and
the documented portions of it along FM 2092.
The system was chartered in 1874 as the Vaughn Ditch Agricultural and
Mechanical Canal. It evolved through time and later became the Menard Irrigation
Company, which is still in operation today. Known locally as “The Ditch,” the main
canal is currently about 4 ft deep, 4 ft wide, and approximately 10 miles long. The
system was constructed beginning in 1874, and portions of the main canal reportedly
followed the abandoned acequia built by the Spaniards living at Presidio San Sabá
from 1757 to 1768 (McWilliams and Finney 2008:15–16). The irrigation system is still
in use and was enlarged and improved at various times. Lateral ditches have been
constructed all along the main canal to channel water into privately owned fields,
but no information has been found about the sequence of lateral construction. It is
likely that lateral ditches have been constructed, used, and abandoned throughout
the 131-year history of the system.
It was recommended that the Menard irrigation system is potentially
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Because no portions
of it would be impacted by the FM 2092 road improvements, however, no further
historical research or field documentation was needed in conjunction with the project
(McWilliams and Boyd 2008:49–50).
Archeological Survey
The intensive archeological survey along 4.9 miles of FM 2092 from the
town of Menard east to just past Fivemile Crossing resulted in the documentation

Chapter 4: The 2006–2007 Investigations
of 10 previously recorded sites and 9 newly discovered sites. Of the 19 sites, 6 have
prehistoric components, 4 have historic components, and 9 have both prehistoric
and historic components. One of the sites with prehistoric and historic components
is 41MN23, Mission San Sabá. All of the other historic components date to the
nineteenth or early twentieth centuries and do not pertain to Spanish occupations
that are the subject of this report. McWilliams and Boyd (2008) present the results
of the survey .
The survey began in the Mission San Sabá search area, defined as
approximately 400 m along the paved roadway, including the entire TxDOT right
of way on the north and south sides of the road. This area is just south of the main
mission compound as defined by Hindes et al. (1995) and extends approximately
100 m east and 300 m west of the Mission San Sabá historical monument.44
The PAI work in the mission area in July 2006 included pedestrian survey,
but this was not particularly productive because both the north and south right-ofway areas were covered in dense grass. Next, a metal detector survey was conducted
in the area north of the road just west of the historical monument. Using Garrett
model GTP 1350 metal detectors, two archeologists walked east-west transects
(parallel to the road) from the bottom of the borrow ditch to the north right-of-way
fence. A pin flag was placed at each metal hit (audible signal), and a 20-m-long
corridor was soon blanketed with pin flags. The archeologists then dug each location
using a small trowel or shovel to recover the metal item causing the detector signal.
It quickly became apparent that many of the hits were caused by modern trash
thrown into the ditch, while others were caused by modern wire fragments and fence
staples. All of the metal items were found in the upper 6 inches of fill, which was
extensively disturbed and full of gravel from the road base fill. The metal detector
survey was terminated at this point, although the detectors proved useful later for
examining the deeper sediments exposed in Gradall trenches.
Within the mission search area, PAI archeologists excavated 19 Gradall
trenches, 11 test units, and 6 shovel tests. Figure 4.4 shows the locations of trenches
and shovel tests in the 400-m-long mission search area, and Figure 4.5 shows the
excavations in the main mission area. The main mission area was defined as being
approximately 79 m in length, extending 33 m east and 46 m west of the historical
monument.
For horizontal control, PAI mapped all the testing and subsequent data
recovery excavations relative to the previous Texas Tech University (TTU) datum
points. PAI also used the arbitrary elevation system established for that work.
Consequently, all PAI excavation data, horizontal and vertical, can be compared
directly with the previous work.
PAI identified the target level in the test excavations along the north right-ofway fence as being at about 99.10–98.80 m, which was the “Spanish zone” previously
defined by TTU archeologists. Hall (1995:25) states that the material evidence
The large gray granite monument is a Texas Centennial historical marker that was originally
placed about a mile away from the mission site in 1936. It was moved to its current location in
the 1990s after the discovery of the mission site.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
along the fence line “clearly defines a subsurface zone spanning the elevation range
of 99.10 to 98.80 m within which a massive amount of fired daub and numerous
Spanish colonial artifacts were recovered. This zone, apparently preserved only in a
narrow band of ground, parallel with the south fence, represented an intact surface
upon which one of the mission structures burned.” Most of the intrusive Spanish
features found by TTU appeared in the lower part of this zone, at about 98.85 m
(Hindes et al. 1995:24–25).
The PAI test excavations in the immediate vicinity of the mission were very
productive on the north side of FM 2092, where a wide range of Spanish colonial
artifacts was recovered, including burned daub, wrought-iron nails, ceramic sherds,
lead fragments, a snipe hinge, and pieces of vesicular basalt used as ground stones.
Excavations farther to the east and west but still north of the road were less
productive, as were the excavations south of FM 2092. For discussion purposes, the
investigations are considered separately for three areas: (1) east and west of the
main mission area but still in the larger mission search area; (2) south of FM 2092
in the main mission area; and (3) north of FM 2092 in the main mission area.
Investigations in the Mission Search Area East
and West of the Mission
Since Backhoe Trenches 12 and 13 excavated east of the mission yielded no
cultural materials (see Figure 4.2), all subsequent work focused on the ca. 400-mlong mission search area. A series of Gradall trenches was excavated closer to the
mission location but still well east and west of the main mission area (see Figure
4.4). Gradall Trenches 1–6 were north of the road 100–200 m east of the monument
and southeast of the prominent southward bend in the San Saba River, Gradall
Trenches 7–10 were north of the road 75–100 m west of the monument, and Gradall
Trenches 11 and 12 were south of the road 90–170 m west of the monument. A metal
detector was used to scan the deposits in all of these trenches, but only modern
artifacts (such as wire and fence staples) were found.
Investigations in the Immediate Vicinity of the
Mission South of FM 2092
In the main mission area, Gradall Trenches 13–15 and 19 were excavated in
the southern right of way (see Figure 4.5). They had to be excavated in the bottom
of the borrow ditch, centered between the road and the south right-of-way fence,
because there were two buried utility lines running east-west within 3 m and parallel
to the south fence.45 The trenches exposed a thick layer of artificial gravels closest to
the paved road. These gravels were deeper than the Spanish zone in many places,
and some alluvial deposits were intact at this depth. As soon as intact deposits
were reached, metal detectors were used to scan the bottom of the trench after each
pass of the bucket. Large numbers of metal staples, iron wire fragments, and other
Glenn Goode (personal communication, 2006) stated that he dug two or three shovel tests near
the southern fence line during the TTU work in the 1990s, and all of these tests were negative.
Grant Hall, Kay Hindes, and Mark Wolf (personal communication, 2006) all remember examining
a long, narrow trench that was dug parallel to the south fence when a buried utility line was
installed. They observed no possible Spanish artifacts but noted a few burned clay-like fragments
that appeared to be different from fired daub.
45

Chapter 4: The 2006–2007 Investigations
modern trash were found. Many of these metal items were well below the Spanish
zone, often inside obvious drying cracks in the clayey soils. No probable Spanish
artifacts were observed in any of these trenches.
The archeologists monitoring the trench excavations observed many
artifacts as the digging progressed. Broken glass (modern beer bottle and clear glass
fragments), aluminum can fragments, and chert flakes and cores were observed.
Some of the flakes and cores were, without doubt, Native-made artifacts. These were
found in the clay alluvial deposits, and their contexts suggested that they represent
an ephemeral prehistoric occupation of this area.
One small burned area found in Gradall Trench 15 was designated Feature
2. It was about 8 cm diameter and less than 5 cm deep, at an approximate elevation
of 98.75 m, but it was only a few centimeters below the disturbed gravelly fill in
what probably was the bottom of the borrow ditch for the pre-1954 county road.
Although it is not known what this feature represents, it is not likely to be an intact
Spanish feature.
As the excavations got below the gravelly fill and into the clay alluvial
deposits, intact wooden posts were encountered in each of the trenches. Six posts were
found, with the first observation being at elevations ranging from 99.25 to 98.78 m.
All of the posts could be traced for at least 20 to 50 cm in depth as the excavations
proceeded. These posts form an unmistakable east-west line running parallel to
the road (see Figure 4.5). The wood was extremely well preserved, and it was clear
that these were remnants of a historic fence that predated the FM 2092 roadway.
Fortuitously, local landowner Otis Lyckman stopped by while the excavations were
in progress in this area. He confirmed that there had been fences along the old
county road, but that they were moved in about 1954 when additional right of way
was acquired for the initial construction of FM 2092.
In conclusion, no evidence was found of Spanish or mission-period activities
south of the road. The trenches revealed that deposits at the same level as the
Spanish occupation zone north of the road are somewhat intact from the bottom
of the ditch toward the south fence, but that road construction removed most of
this zone between the ditch bottom and the road. The absence of Spanish artifacts
suggests that mission activities did not extend this far south. The Native American
artifacts cannot be assumed to be associated with the mission. Although some of
these materials could be from the mission period, most of the lithic artifacts probably
predate the mission occupation. The survey of FM 2092 beyond the mission area
revealed ephemeral prehistoric sites scattered all along the road, but the artifact
densities at them were extremely low (Boyd and McWilliams 2008:36–40, 47–49).
Investigations in the Immediate Vicinity of the
Mission North of FM 2092
PAI conducted extensive excavations in the immediate vicinity of the main
mission compound north of FM 2092. This work included four shovel tests, three
Gradall trenches, two test units (1x1 m) in the bottoms of Gradall trenches, and
nine test units along the north fence line (see Figures 4.4 and 4.5).

101

102

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
The three Gradall trenches were dug specifically to see if the Spanish colonial
zone—the level where Spanish artifacts were concentrated as identified by TTU
archeologists during previous excavations—was present in the bottom of the borrow
ditch or underneath FM 2092. The stratigraphy observed in all three trenches
demonstrated that this zone was completely removed from the bottom of the ditch
all the way to the north edge of the paved road. While the alluvial sediments beneath
the artificial fill layer appeared to be intact, they were below an elevation of 98.80 m,
which indicated that only very deep intrusive features might be preserved. As soon
as intact deposits were encountered, metal detectors were used to scan the trench
bottom after each pass of the bucket. No mission-related artifacts were found, but
some iron wire and fence staples were found. These probably represent items that
fell down into drying cracks.
Test Units 7 (98.88–98.78 m) and 8 (98.88–98.78 m) were excavated in the
bottom of the trenches west of the monument. They yielded some modern debris—
likely materials that fell down cracks in the clayey soil—but no Spanish materials
were recovered. In contrast to the excavations in and south of the borrow ditch, the
test units along the north fence line were very productive, especially those west
of the monument. Test Units 1–6 were 1x1-m units, while Test Units 9–11 were
50x50-cm units. These units identified the intact Spanish colonial cultural zone
within the right of way.
When certain artifacts are mentioned in the discussion below, the words
Spanish, historic, and modern are used to differentiate the inferred ages of the
objects. Items are identified as Spanish only if they are definitely attributable to the
mission occupation period. All of the fired daub is presumed to be of Spanish origin.
Mussel shells and bones are not assigned a specific age. The chipped lithic artifacts
could be prehistoric or historic, and they are not assigned a Spanish designation
unless they are definitely of Spanish origin or are otherwise associated with the
mission occupations.
Test Unit 1 was placed directly south of where TTU archeologists dug an
L-shaped block of four excavation units (designated N975 W1018, N975 W1019,
N976 W1018, and N977 W1018). These were some of the most productive units
excavated by TTU, yielding dozens of artifacts, a posthole, and thousands of grams
of burned daub, with a distinct concentration from 99.00 to 98.80 m elevation (Hall
1995:25, Figure 6). PAI Test Unit 1 was also productive. Level 1 was negative. Level
2 (99.20–99.10 m) produced one piece of debitage, two pieces of historic metal, and
one mussel shell fragment. Level 3 (99.10–99.00 m) produced ca. 240 g of daub and
one Spanish wrought nail. In Level 4 (99.00–98.90), daub increased significantly (to
4,500 g), and no other artifacts were recovered. Level 5 (98.90–98.80 m) produced
229 g of daub, two Spanish wrought nails, and one Spanish snipe hinge.
Feature 1, a Spanish colonial posthole, was found at 98.84–98.61 m in Test
Unit 1. The upper portion of this feature was a circular stain of dark sediment
with fragments of daub and charcoal. When profiled, the posthole could be traced
downward and tapered to a pointed end. The lower portion of this feature contained
a small remnant of rotted wooden post in the center. While it is possible that a

Chapter 4: The 2006–2007 Investigations
modern fence post could have been in this location, this feature was interpreted
as a Spanish mission post for four reasons: (1) The dark stain of the posthole first
appeared at 98.84 m, near the bottom of the burned daub layer and consistent with
the depth of a Spanish posthole found 100 cm to the north (Feature 8 in Hindes et
al. [1995:29, Figure 6]); (2) the posthole appeared underneath the daub layer and
did not appear to be intrusive through it; (3) the preserved wood was in an advanced
state of decay, as might be expected for a 249-year-old post; and (4) all of the wood
from the modern posts (i.e., less than 50 years old) was extremely well preserved
in comparison with the Feature 1 wood.
Test Unit 4 was placed south of Test Unit 1 to define the southern extent of
the mission deposits and to follow the Feature 1 post stain. Test Unit 4 produced
ca. 4 g of daub and two pieces of historic glass in Level 1 (99.10–99.00 m); 32 g
of daub, one modern fence staple, and one piece of unidentified metal in Level 2
(99.00–98.90 m); 132 g of daub, six pieces of debitage, and two pieces of glass in
Level 3 (98.90–98.80 m); and 46 g of daub, three pieces of debitage, one burned rock,
and six mussel shell fragments in Level 4 (98.80–98.70 m). No features were found.
Test Units 2 and 3 are contiguous units placed 8–10 m west of Test Unit 1.
The location was selected because it was directly south of the north-south line of
postholes found by TTU archeologists and interpreted as posts along the western
stockade wall. Level 1 in Test Unit 2 (99.30–99.20 m) produced 66 g of daub, one piece
of debitage, and one piece of historic glass. Level 2 (99.20–99.10 m) was negative.
Level 3 (99.10–99.00 m) produced six pieces of debitage, five pieces of historic glass,
and four mussel shell fragments. Level 4 (99.00–98.90 m) produced 67 g of daub,
three pieces of debitage, five pieces of historic glass, two bone fragments, two mussel
shell fragments, and one fence staple. Level 5 (98.90–98.80 m) produced 4 g of daub,
two pieces of debitage, and one bone fragment.
Test Unit 3 produced nothing in Level 1 and only fragments of modern glass
in Level 2. Level 3 (99.10–99.00 m) produced 98 g of daub along with 2 flakes, 2
burned rocks, and fragments of bone and mussel shell. More bone and mussel shell
fragments, along with a piece of modern glass, were found in Level 4 (99.00–98.90
m). Level 5 (98.90–98.80 m) produced flakes, burned rocks, mussel shells, a lithic tool,
a piece of daub, and one probable Spanish item—a fragment of a ground stone tool
made of vesicular basalt (similar grinding tool fragments are reported by Hindes et
al. [1995:Figure 25]). A modern post with well-preserved wood was also encountered
in this unit; the top of this post was observed from 98.88 to 98.82 m.
Test Unit 5 was along the fence east of the monument, near the culvert that
runs underneath the historical monument parking area. This test unit yielded bones,
mussel shell, charcoal, chert flakes, a lithic tool, and historic glass (not Spanish). The
only Spanish artifacts were 16 pieces of daub and a sherd of blue-and-white majolica,
all from 98.90–98.60 m. The sherd was in what appeared to be a rodent-disturbed
area. Modern fence staples were found in the same levels as the Spanish artifacts.
Test Unit 6 was 13 m east of Test Unit 5, and the only Spanish objects found
were two pieces of daub (at 98.70–98.60 m). These were found a little lower than
the Spanish artifact zone west of and near the monument, with the zone apparently

103

104

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
dipping downward slightly to the east following the natural ground slope. This unit
also yielded chert flakes and a burned rock, along with charcoal and mussel shell
fragments. Modern debris, including a fence staple and an asphalt fragment, was
found between 98.70 and 98.50 m. Feature 3, a modern post, was exposed at 98.75 m.
The wood was well preserved, and remnants of the post were traced downward to
98.35 m.
Test Units 9–11 were placed to fill in gaps between the test units along the
fence line. Test Units 9 and 10 were between Test Unit 1 and the monument. Test
Unit 11 was west of the monument between Test Units 5 and 6. Test Unit 9 yielded
several Spanish artifacts—three fragments of lead (probably fired lead balls), a
redware sherd, and a wrought-iron nail. A substantial amount of burned daub also
was found, indicating that the burned daub layer observed in Test Unit 1 extends
at least 5 m to the east. All of the Spanish colonial materials were found at 99.10
to 98.70 m, with most at 99.00–98.90 m.
Test Unit 10 was along the fence immediately north of the western culvert
that runs under the historical monument parking area. This unit yielded a fair
amount of burned daub. A fragment of ground stone made of vesicular basalt is the
only Spanish artifact. The daub and basalt were found between 99.10 to 98.80 m.
Other materials recovered include historic metal (not Spanish), charcoal, mussel
shell fragments, and modern metal.
Test Unit 11 yielded only a small amount of burned daub but no artifacts
of Spanish origin. A bone and mussel shell fragments were the only other artifacts
recovered.
Discussion of Initial Survey and Testing Results
Figure 4.6 is a schematic cross section of FM 2092, just west of the historical
monument. It shows the vertical positions of the Gradall trenches and test units
relative to the paved road and the zone of Spanish colonial deposits. Testing
revealed that the cultural zone was intact only along the northern fence line. No
mission-related remains were found south of the road. Because no testing was done
underneath the paved portion of FM 2092, it is not certain that all of the natural
alluvial deposits containing the Spanish occupation zone were destroyed by the
1954 construction of FM 2092 or by the earlier county road, but given the depth of
disturbances at the margins of the paved roadway, this seems likely.
All of the mission artifacts were found in the test units along the northern
right-of-way fence line, and it appeared that there was only a 2- to 3-m-wide strip
of intact deposits remaining. Cultural materials from the test units west of the
monument are as follows: 6,390 g of daub (most in Test Units 1, 4, and 9); 4 wrought
nails; 1 snipe hinge (a gozne); 1 sherd (redware in Test Unit 9); 3 lead lumps; 2 ground
stone fragments (vesicular basalt); and 58 probable Native American artifacts (38
flakes, 2 lithic tools, 18 burned limestone rocks). Cultural materials from the test
units east of the monument are as follows: 24 g of daub; 1 sherd (blue-and-white
majolica in Test Unit 5); and 15 probable Native American artifacts (all flakes).

Figure 4.6. Schematic cross section of FM 2092 roadway in the mission area west of the historical monument
based on the 2006 Phase I test excavations.

Excavations west of the monument (totaling 4.5 m2) produced 1,420 g of
burned daub and 2.4 Spanish artifacts per square meter. Excavations east of the
monument (totaling 1.5 m2) produced 16 g of burned daub and 0.6 Spanish artifacts
per square meter. The bulk of the Spanish colonial remains were found west of the
monument.
Three cultural features were identified in the northern right of way, but only
Feature 1 is probably associated with the mission occupation. Features 3 and 4 (in
Test Units 6 and 3) are interpreted as modern fence posts.
Figure 4.7 shows the spatial relationships between the PAI 2006–2007 test
excavations and the Spanish colonial features found north of the road by TTU. The
concentrated artifacts and features found along the north edge of the right of way
corresponded with the TTU interpretations of where the main compound of Mission
San Sabá had been located.

Chapter 4: The 2006–2007 Investigations
PHASE II: DATA RECOVERY
The Excavations
The Phase I test excavations demonstrated that intact Spanish colonial
deposits associated with Mission San Sabá were present within the FM 2092 right
of way. But it was also clear that intact deposits were preserved only in a narrow
strip (2–3 m wide) along the northern right-of-way fence and that road construction
and borrow ditch maintenance had removed the rest of the cultural zone to the
south. Following consultation between TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission,
all parties agreed that the intact deposits warranted more attention, so the work
immediately proceeded into a data recovery phase. The data recovery effort focused
on hand excavation of 1x1-m units to recover Spanish material culture and search
for mission-related features. From November 27, 2006, to February 9, 2007, PAI
archeologists excavated seventy-eight 1x1-m units and four 1x0.5-m units, followed
by Gradall stripping of two linear excavation blocks in a final attempt to identify
features that might be associated with the mission occupation.
When the Phase I and Phase II work is combined, the total number of
hand-excavated units in the main mission area is seventy-nine 1x1-m units, four
1x0.5-m units, and one 0.5x0.5-m unit (Tables 4.3 and 4.4, Figures 4.8 and 4.9). The
total volume of excavated materials is 33.9 m3. Most of the excavation units were
grouped into a linear east-west corridor in one to three rows adjacent to the northern
right-of-way fence. The first row was placed 10 cm south of the fence line so that
the excavations would not destabilize the fence or cause it to collapse. Similarly,
the excavation rows were interrupted in the vicinity of the historical monument
to avoid undercutting the associated parking platform and concrete culverts. It is
not known if the deposits underneath the monument parking area are preserved
or were destroyed by construction.
The data recovery excavations (including the original test units) are
summarized as follows: Row A, 10–110 cm south of fence, 46 units (1x1 m) and 4
units (1x0.5 m); Row B, 110–210 cm south of fence, 28 units (1x1 m); and Row C,
210–310 cm south of fence, 5 units (1x1 m). The units in Rows A to C are grouped
into two excavation areas, one east of the monument and the other west of it. Unit
designations are a trinomial onsisting of the row number (A, B, or C) followed by E
or W to denote east or west of the monument, and ending with the farthest distance
(in meters) along the fence line from the monument. For example, Unit AW8 was
in the first row south of the fence and was 7–8 m west of the monument. The zero
point on the fence line at the center of the monument coincides with main northsouth gridline defined as Grid 0 (relative to east and west) in the TTU site grid.46
When the Phase II hand excavations began, the Phase I test units (originally
designated as Test Units 1–11) were reassigned new unit numbers to conform
with the unit designation system for data recovery (Table 4.5). The 1x1-m test
units were simply given a new designation and the smaller 0.5x0.5-m units were
expanded into 1x1-m units. By doing this, all of the hand-excavated units from 0 to
The TTU grid was oriented to magnetic north, while the PAI grid was oriented to the fence at
the north edge of the FM 2092 right of way.

After completion of the hand excavations, two large blocks were mechanically
stripped using a Gradall (Figures 4.10 and 4.11). Both blocks were oriented eastwest, beginning 30 cm south of and running parallel to the northern right-of-way
fence. The stripping had to be started well beyond the Grid 0 point, both on the
east and west sides, to avoid undercutting or damaging the historical monument
platform and the concrete culverts on either side. The West Gradall Block was 33 m
long, beginning at 9 m west of Grid 0 and ended at 42 m west of it. The block varied
from 4.0 to 4.2 m wide. The East Gradall Block was 14 m long and extended from
10 to 24 m east of Grid 0. This block varied from 4.0 to 4.3 m wide.
Both blocks were excavated well below the Spanish colonial cultural zone
and were carefully monitored by archeologists looking for evidence of features.
No Spanish cultural materials or features were observed. The trenches exposed
a distinct contact running down the center of each block between the intact finegrained alluvial sediment along the fence line and the gravelly artificial fill in the
center of the borrow ditch. This contact line was particularly visible in the West
Gradall Block (see Figure 4.11, top), and it marks the deep borrow ditch that was
dug well below the mission cultural zone.
Field Collection Policy
During both the testing and data recovery phases of investigation, the
following types of materials were collected in their entirety whenever encountered:
glass, ceramics, lead, chipped stones (except obvious broken roadbase gravels),
ground stones, battered stones, bones, daub, burned rocks, snail shells, mussel shells
(except tiny nondiagnostic pieces), charcoal, and recent historic/modern artifacts. All
iron artifacts were collected, except for 11 iron fence staples found during testing
that were accidentally discarded and long sections of wire (including hog wire and
barbed wire). Historical and archeological evidence indicates that the northern
fence was repaired or moved several times, and in all cases the long wire sections

found ran parallel to the road and current fence line. Because their identification
was never in doubt, the lengthy sections were discarded while short segments were
collected as samples. Also collected were wood samples associated with postholes and
fence posts and sediment samples from all features. Some samples of unmodified
stone were collected during testing until natural gravels were found to be common
throughout the alluvial sediments. The only items that were consistently discarded
were unmistakably modern debris. These were aluminum (e.g., beer and soda cans
and pull tabs), asphalt, plastic, rubber, and styrofoam.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Laboratory Processing
Artifacts and samples were brought to the PAI laboratory after each week in
the field. Materials were washed, cataloged, labeled, bagged, and tagged according to
the artifact processing and curation standards of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin. Artifacts and samples were initially
sorted into basic material categories (glass, metal, ceramic, daub, bone, and charcoal).
They were then grouped into one of five major temporal/occupation groups: (1)
modern and recent historic materials; (2) chipped historic glass; (3) Spanish colonial
artifacts (which includes Native-made ceramics for reasons discussed later); (4)
probable Spanish colonial artifacts; and (5) Native-made lithics. Within these
categories, artifacts were further subdivided into specific functional categories or
artifact types, such as majolica, glass beads, and iron nails. This artifact classification
system is described in more detail in Chapter 5.
The identification of Spanish colonial artifacts was aided by numerous
publications that describe material culture associated with missions, presidios,
ranchos, and other settlements. Especially important were previous publications on
the archeology of Mission San Sabá and Presidio San Sabá (Gilmore 1967; Hindes et
al. 1995; McWilliams 1995; Norment 2007; Schooler 2009; Walter et al. 2003; Zayatz
2004). Other publications that were particularly helpful for identifying artifacts
collection include investigation reports for the missions at San Lorenzo (Tunnell
and Newcomb 1969), Rosario (Gilmore 1974a; Nickels 2000), and Espíritu Santo
(Walter 2007), as well as general studies of Spanish material culture by Deagan
(1987, 2002) and Fox and Ulrich (2008).
Spanish Colonial Cultural Materials and Features
The recovered assemblage includes 100 Spanish colonial artifacts such as
metal, ceramics, glass; 22.1 kg of burned daub; and 12 artifacts of probable Spanish
origin. In addition, numerous bones and macrobotanical remains are considered
to be associated with the Spanish occupation. Many other types of materials
are probably associated with earlier or later activities. The recovered cultural
materials are discussed in detail in Chapters 5–10. Twenty-eight cultural features
documented during the investigations are described in Chapter 11. Most features
were determined to be late historic, modern, or natural features. Nine features
attributed to the Spanish occupation are classified as postholes and posts, a bone
pit feature, a concentration of Spanish artifacts, and an extensive but discontinuous
ash lens. Many Spanish colonial artifacts and burned daub pieces were found in
and near the ash lens, and it is interpreted as representing the mission burning
episode that occurred in March 1758.
The chipped stone artifacts are an especially problematic group. In examining
these materials, it was acknowledged that they could be remains of Native American
occupations and activities that predate or postdate the mission occupation. It was
also acknowledged that some of the chipped stone artifacts were probably made
and deposited during the mission occupation, and these materials could have been
made by the Spanish, the Mexican Indians they brought with them, the few Apaches

Chapter 4: The 2006–2007 Investigations
who lived there, or the larger groups of Apaches during their brief stays outside the
mission. After a careful analysis of these materials, the origins of the chipped stone
artifacts are still unclear (see Chapter 8).
Spatial Analyses
Following the laboratory processing and artifact identification phases, all
provenience and artifact data were entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets
that were transferred to a Microsoft Access database for inventory and analysis
purposes. PAI graphics supervisor Sandy Hannum designed a template that
would take artifact provenience data from the database and plot it directly into
site plan maps and profiles. These maps were created using Grapher, a software
program by Golden Software. The maps produced in this manner allowed PAI
archeologists to look for patterns in the horizontal and vertical distributions of
artifacts and features.
PAI archeologists made extensive use of the feature and artifact evidence
associated with the TTU 1993–1994 and 1997 archeological work (Figure 4.12).
While no attempt to describe or analyze all of the TTU artifact and feature data is
made, combining the TTU and PAI maps and spatial information greatly enhances
the interpretability of the archeology, as Chapters 12–15 demonstrate.
Analyses of the Destruction Painting and the
Inventory of Supplies
Two unique historical sources greatly influenced the interpretations of the
archeological data. An intensive examination of the 1760s painting Destruction of
the Mission San Sabá and a reexamination of the 1756–1757 Inventory of Supplies
(with new translation insights) broadened the research avenues and further
enhanced an understanding of the mission archeology. Chapters 13 and 15 interpret
the spatial layout of the archeological features and the material culture in light of
these documents.
Curation
All project records, recovered artifacts, and special samples will be submitted
for permanent curation to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of
Texas at Austin. Cultural materials in the following categories are curated: Spanish
colonial artifacts; probable Spanish colonial artifacts; chipped historic glass; Nativemade lithics; fired daub; animal bones; and macrobotanical remains. In addition,
all of the items classified as recent historic/modern materials are curated. The logic
behind this is that it: (1) it is sometimes difficult to distinguish some recent historic/
modern items from older Spanish colonial artifacts, especially when the items are
small objects and fragments of iron; and (2) many of the recent historic-age items
provide evidence of historic activities (such as fence-building) and historic visitation
that had an impact on the integrity of specific areas of the mission site.
The ultimate disposition of the cultural materials and records associated with
the TTU investigations is not known at this time. Although the records, artifacts,

and other materials from the 1993–1994 and 1997 TTU investigations are still being
analyzed, all of these artifacts are from the privately owned portion of the site and
remain the personal property of the landowners.47
Brochure for Public Outreach
The data recovery field investigations ended in 2007, the year that
marked the 250th anniversary of the founding of the mission and presidio. To
commemorate the occasion, the City of Menard and the Presidio de San Sabá
Restoration Corporation held several public events that summer. One of the events
was a Pilgrimage Walk from the mission site to downtown Menard, followed by a
rededication of the recently restored 1899 Catholic church. The Texas Archeological
Society field school, directed by TTU archeologist Dr. Tamra Walter, was held at
Presidio San Sabá that year. Because so many people would be in Menard for these
events, TxDOT and PAI capitalized on this opportunity for public outreach. In
conjunction with the data recovery investigations, PAI produced a brochure titled
“The Menard Irrigation Canal: 250 Years of Agricultural History, 1757–2007.” It
presents a brief history of the irrigation system, including evidence that portions
of the 1874 canal followed the “Old Spanish Ditch” built and used by the people
living at the presidio from 1757 to 1772. A few thousand copies of this brochure
were printed and distributed in the Menard area during these public events. This
brochure is reproduced in Appendix H.

The artifacts recovered from many years of investigations at Presidio San Sabá also are privately
owned. Currently, the Presidio de San Saba Restoration Corporation (a nonprofit charitable
group founded in ca. 2001) is developing and implementing long-term plans to preserve, restore,
and interpret the presidio. The plans include a public interpretive center, and this facility may
eventually house the cultural materials and project records from the presidio investigations.

CHAPTER 5: ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
Jennifer K. McWilliams

The Mission San Sabá site is unique in Texas because it represents a brief
occupation—just 11 months—from April 1757 to March 1758. It was intended, of
course, to have a much longer life, but historical events dictated otherwise. Most
Spanish missions in the southwestern United States were occupied for many years,
some for many decades. Archeologically, this mission exemplifies the Pompeii effect
in some ways, because its occupation ended instantly and its physical remains
are a snapshot in time. But unlike the Roman town of Pompeii, which was sealed
underneath volcanic ash in a.d. 79, the remains of Mission San Sabá have undergone
extensive disturbances since the attack and destruction occurred.
The Spanish colonial artifact assemblage associated with the site is difficult
to recognize and interpret in some ways due to a variety of factors, including extensive
postdepositional disturbances, the presence of materials from different time periods
(including pre-mission and post-mission artifacts), and the differential preservation
of various materials due to chemical, physical, and biological deterioration. Despite
these challenges, two research tools proved useful in understanding the material
culture described in this chapter. First, the investigators compiled a collection of
historical quotes and observations gathered from published works and personal
communications about the mission area and other pertinent places in Menard County
(see Appendix A). Second, Father Trinidad’s 1756–1757 Inventory of Supplies (Dennis
1995a), an exhaustive inventory of all the materials and supplies purchased for
and brought to the new mission, was compiled into a searchable database. Initially
created as part of a previous project (McWilliams 2001), the database was updated
for this one. In conjunction with Mariah Wade, many of the Spanish words in the
original document were retranslated, resulting in the revised Inventory of Supplies
translation that is provided in Appendix B. This listing is not only informative but
is a critical tool for understanding the artifact assemblage, allowing us to assign
Spanish terms and functions to some of the items that were unearthed.
POSTDEPOSITIONAL DISTURBANCES TO THE
MATERIAL REMAINS
To understand the artifacts recovered from Mission San Sabá, it is necessary
to look at the physical characteristics and history of the site. The mission site is
located on a Holocene terrace of the San Saba River. Most Spanish colonial cultural
materials were found between 20 and 50 cm below surface, within fine-grained silty
and clayey sediments, with the exception of a few items that were moved downward

127

128

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
by natural processes (i.e., fallen into drying cracks) or moved as a result of ditch
maintenance or fence repair. For various reasons, portions of these cultural deposits
are extensively disturbed, there is no natural stratification to aid in separating
materials, and there is only limited cultural stratification.
The mission site is immediately west of a once prominent spring on a
former channel of the San Saba River. A local informant reported that the spring
once gushed some 1,200–1,400 gallons of water per minute, but the spring silted in
when the river changed course between 1925 and 1945 (Rambo 2006; see Appendix
A). In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the spring was a popular
place for family gatherings and picnics. There is abundant evidence that people
visiting the area walked off with collectibles from the ruins. Around the turn of the
century, Menard County Judge J. Callan (1901) drew a map for preservationist and
historian Adina De Zavala. The map indicates a “presidio smelter”48 which Callan
mentioned in an accompanying letter (see Figure 3.1). He noted “some crucibles, a
few small slabs of lead containing a considerable per centum of silver, some tools
and implements and parts of human bones” were found at or near this place (Callan
[1901:2–3], as quoted in Hindes et al. [1995:10]). Callan also stated that “Half a
wagon load of these relics was sent to the State Fair some eight or ten years ago
and never returned, presumably because no one was interested enough to look after
them” (Callan 1901:2–3; Hindes et al. 1995:10). This statement refers to a state fair
held in Dallas between 1891 and 1893. This is but one example, and there is no way
to know how many pioneer families and relic collectors visited the mission site over
the years and how many and what kinds of artifacts they removed.
The assemblage contains large quantities of recent historic materials and
modern trash left by travelers, and mixing of deposits is attributed to various roadimprovement episodes. The route of FM 2092 may follow the old Spanish road, and
it was a gravel farm road for many years in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. It was paved in the 1950s because it had become well traveled. And in
rural areas, where there are roads, there are fences. At least two different fence lines
have run along the current northern FM 2092 right of way, resulting in artifacts
associated with the current and former fence lines, such as barbed wire, hog wire
fragments, staples, and nails. Archeological excavations revealed the presence of
former fence lines associated with the earlier paved or gravel road.
Perhaps the most detrimental of all the postdepositional disturbances are
the impacts from historic and modern agricultural practices. The mission site has
most likely been under cultivation more or less continually since late-nineteenthcentury pioneers cleared the land and began farming in the San Saba valley. While
the earliest farming would have involved plows pulled by oxen, mules, or horses,
the disturbances intensified with twentieth-century mechanized farming practices.
In addition to the various forms of postdepositional disturbances, confusion
arises because the site’s artifact assemblage contains Native American chipped stone
artifacts that originate from multiple sources at different times. It is logical that
Many early historians were fixated on the Spanish mining efforts in the Central Texas region,
and Callan mistakenly identified the mission site as a smelter.
48

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
Native Americans used the spring prior to the Spanish occupation, some were there
as part of the mission activities, and it is likely that Native Americans returned to
the mission after it was destroyed in 1758. Native American artifacts from all these
periods are mixed together with Spanish materials and roadside trash. And the
Native-made lithic artifacts may even be commingled with mission-period lithics
generated by Spaniards, since there is historical evidence that Spanish soldiers
sometimes made their own gunflints (Bruseth et al. 2004:88; Durst 2009:28). Thus,
with few exceptions, it is impossible to distinguish pre-mission and post-mission
Native American lithics and ceramics from similar Native-made materials deposited
during the brief mission occupation or during the Norteño attack on the mission.
Despite the evidence for extensive disturbances and mixing of material
remains, the current investigations did encounter some intact Spanish features
and a relatively intact mission-period stratigraphic zone. Most of the missionperiod artifacts were found in or near an intermittent ash layer that is recognized
as evidence of the mission burning on the original Spanish colonial surface.
ARTIFACT ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION
Given the long span of human utilization and the overprinted nature of
the material culture, one of the first challenges was to weed out, as accurately
as possible, the recent historic or modern materials and objects associated with
premission Native American occupations so the analysis could focus only on the
materials associated with the mission occupation. This chapter deals with the
historic artifacts that were analyzed by Prewitt and Associates (PAI), including
materials of Spanish colonial origin as well as materials from subsequent historic
periods and into the modern era.
In analyzing artifact assemblages from historic sites, it is often difficult to
choose between functional- and material-based categories, as Tunnell (1969:54) notes.
In his report on Mission San Lorenzo (1762–1771), Tunnell dealt almost exclusively
with Spanish colonial artifacts, with the exception of recent bottle glass. Similarly,
Hall and Gilmore’s (1995:31–54) artifact analysis categorizes artifacts by material
types and includes certain functional groups within each material type (i.e., nails
and glass). In contrast, McWilliams (2001) uses a combination of functional groups
and material types in her classification. The artifact analysis in this report generally
follows the same classification scheme, with some modifications. Artifacts were
first classified into broad chronological/occupational groups, then they were further
divided into subgroups based on material types and function. This type of scheme
is more efficient when dealing with assemblages with materials from multiple
periods because it allows a great deal of flexibility in the assignment of functional
groups. The five primary artifact groupings used are: (1) modern and recent historic
materials; (2) chipped historic glass; (3) Spanish colonial artifacts; (4) probable
Spanish colonial artifacts; and (5) Native-made lithic artifacts of unknown origin.
The artifacts assigned to the first four groups are described in detail in this
chapter. The last group is discussed only briefly at the end of this chapter, and a
detailed analysis is presented in Chapter 8. The Native-made lithic artifacts were

129

130

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
put into their own group because these items could not be attributed to any specific
occupation group or time period with any degree of confidence. Three other groups of
materials were analyzed by independent consultants and are discussed later—fired
daub in Chapter 7, vertebrate faunal remains in Chapter 9, and macrobotanical
remains in Chapter 10. In addition, Chapter 6 is devoted to a special study that
used chemical analyses of lead isotopes to determine the sources of individual lead
artifacts.
The PAI investigations recovered 2,436 artifacts, of which 100 are Spanish
colonial, 12 are probable Spanish colonial, and 651 are Native-made lithic artifacts of
uncertain origin. Table 5.1 summarizes the recovered artifacts; Appendix C provides
detailed provenience data.
Many artifacts of recent historic or modern manufacture were collected
during the excavations in the field. This was done for consistency and to eliminate
the possibility that some important mission-period artifacts might be accidentally
discarded because they were incorrectly assumed to be recent historic or modern.
In the lab, these modern pieces were identified and separated from the rest of the
collection.. These include a variety of modern items (i.e., less than 50 years old) and
late historic artifacts that clearly postdate the Spanish occupation. These items were
assigned to the Modern and Recent Historic Materials category.
The Chipped Historic Glass category consists of nine specimens of chipped
glass, the product of someone knapping a piece of glass to make a tool. These
items were assigned to a separate analytical category because the previous Texas
Tech University (TTU) investigations recovered chipped glass that was probably
associated with the mission occupation. However, the analysis of the PAI assemblage
indicates that these are pieces of historic glass that definitely postdate the mission
occupation.
The Spanish Colonial Artifacts category consists of all items that were
certainly (or almost certainly) associated with the 1757–1758 mission occupation,
regardless of who made them or where they came from. The group is dominated
by materials made by the Spanish—manufactured in Spain, New Spain (Mexico),
or even in the northern frontier missions in the province of Texas (especially the
ceramics). But it also includes some things that were probably made by Native
Americans but used and deposited during the mission occupation.
The Probable Spanish Colonial category consists of 12 items that are
interpreted as being Spanish colonial in age and probably used and deposited during
the mission occupation. Relative to the Spanish Colonial Artifacts group, however,
the identifications of the items are more tenuous.
MODERN AND RECENT HISTORIC MATERIAL
Almost all of the modern (less than 50 years old) and recent historic materials
date to the twentieth century, although some items could date to the late nineteenth
century. This group includes glass fragments (from bottles and electrical insulators),
fence staples, wire nails, wire, metal debris (primarily from modern “tin cans” but
also small pieces of other “scrap” metal), nails, plastic or rubber, ammunition, and

window screen fragments. Aside from fencing materials, most artifacts in this
category were probably thrown out by people driving along FM 2092. Aluminum
pull tabs from beer or soda cans were common in the excavations, but these were
not collected or quantified.

131

132

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
PAI excavations recovered 1,664 recent historic artifacts and modern items.
The largest category is glass fragments (n = 896), of which 431 are brown glass
from beer bottles, 106 are clear glass, and 183 are electrical insulator fragments
representing three distinct styles. The remaining 176 fragments include numerous
pieces from seven distinct bottles, and a variety of glass colors are represented—
solarized (n = 78), a distinct amber (n = 63), dark green, straw, dark brownishblack, and pale blue-green. Artifacts associated with the livestock fences—past
and present—are 244 fence staples, 11 modern wire nails, and 130 pieces of wire.
Fragments of iron, most probably from modern metal cans, were common (n = 360),
and there are 8 other metal artifacts (including a brass cartridge case, window screen
fragments, a horseshoe fragment, and a piece of lead with a wire nail attached).
Eight pieces of plastic or rubber, 2 ceramic whiteware sherds, and 5 unidentifiable
objects complete the modern materials assemblage.
TTU’s 1993–1994 excavations recovered 23 fragments of modern glass, 11
wire nails and staples, wire and miscellaneous metal (including “trace chain link[s]”),
an S-shaped hook, a three-blade pocket knife, can fragments, and machine parts
(Hall and Gilmore 1995:40, 40–42). A portion of a metal strap (Lot 162) collected in
the 1993 excavation and reported by Hall and Gilmore (1995:40) refits with a metal
strap fragment recovered by PAI (Lot 306). After they were put together, the piece
was determined to be a leaf spring from a wagon.
TTU’s 1997 excavations produced 568 pieces of modern material (McWilliams
2001:66–67), of which 279 are pieces of metal (over 150 are fragments of thin iron
probably from modern cans). The rest are 100+ modern nails, staples, and wire
fragments as well as soda pull tabs, rubber fragments, modern horseshoes, bullets
and ammunition, and one 1912 U.S. penny (McWilliams 2001:66–67).
CHIPPED HISTORIC GLASS
The 1997 TTU excavations produced three pieces of olive green glass that
exhibit flaking (McWilliams 2001:86). These specimens are thought to be missionperiod glass intentionally flaked into tools by Spaniards or Native Americans during
the mission occupation (see specimens c, d, and e in McWilliams [2001:Figure 19]).
Consequently, PAI archeologists paid special attention to the glass artifacts recovered
during in the 2006–2007 investigations. Nine fragments of chipped glass were found
in two adjacent units: Unit AW28, 5 fragments (Lot 9); Unit AW28, 1 fragment (Lot
266); and Unit AW29, 3 fragments (Lot 267).
All have obvious worked edges with multiple parallel flake scars, and there
is little doubt that they were chipped by human hands. However, the origin of
these items is an enigma. Unlike the olive green chipped glass recovered by TTU,
these nine specimens represent historic-age glass not associated with the mission
occupation. They have a light amethyst color characteristic of clear glass solarized
by exposure to sunlight. This is glass decolorized by manganese dioxide, which was
used briefly from the 1820s to 1930s and most commonly from the 1880s to ca. 1918
(Lindsey 2010). In addition, several refit with each other and with other unmodified
glass fragments in the same lots. A partial bottle base was reconstructed from these

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
fragments. It is an oval-shaped panel bottle base with two flat sides that is similar
in shape to the Baltimore Oval and Philadelphia Oval bottles illustrated by Wilson
(1981:Bottle Shapes and Finishes, o and q). The bottle base has a horizontal mold
seam along the bottom and a vertical mold seam running up one of the curved sides.
The glass thickness fluctuates irregularly across the base and up the lower portions
of the bottle walls. These attributes are consistent with the bottle having been handblown into a cup mold and dating from the 1870s to ca. 1910 (Lindsey 2010). Based
on the type of glass and the bottle attributes, it is certain that the glass bottle was
manufactured, broken, and flaked long after the Spanish occupation.
There is no way of knowing when the bottle(s) was broken or who flaked the
edges of some of the fragments, but there are at least five possible scenarios: (1) the
glass was flaked by historic Plains Indians to create expedient tools during a brief
camping episode during the 1870s; (2) the glass was flaked by someone who visited
the old mission in the nineteenth century, perhaps in the 1880s or 1890s when many
people visited the site to collect relics for the state fair exhibit (Callan 1901:2–3; see
Chapter 5); (3) the glass was flaked by a visitor to the site in the early twentieth
century; (4) the glass was flaked by a visitor to the site later in the twentieth century,
perhaps by local children playing in the borrow ditches along FM 2092; and (5) the
glass knapping may have been done by a visitor to the site after the mission location
was rediscovered in 1993, perhaps even by one of the archeology students or site
visitors during the 1993–1994 or 1997 TTU investigations.
The patination of the glass fragments presents one final piece of evidence.
The surfaces on all of the specimens exhibit a moderate degree of patination, but the
broken and chipped edges exhibit none. This indicates that the bottle was probably
exposed on the surface for some time before it was broken and chipped. This makes
the third through fifth scenarios more likely than the first two.
SPANISH COLONIAL ARTIFACTS
Artifacts categorized as Spanish colonial include items made by the Spanish,
both in the Old World and the New World, as well as items used at the mission by
the Spaniards and mission Indians. However, because the mission was ransacked
and burned by Norteño Indians who were engaged in trade with the French, some
period artifacts may have been deposited at the mission by the Norteños. European
trade items that arrived at the site in this manner would also be classified as Spanish
colonial artifacts unless they were recognizable as being of French manufacture
(none in this collection are). The Spanish colonial artifacts are categorized by a
combination of material type, function, and decorative style. For the benefit of future
researchers, lot numbers are used in tables, text, and figures so that there is no
doubt about which specimens are being described.
Iron Artifacts
Snipe Hinge
A snipe hinge, or a gozne, is composed of two interlocking wrought-iron
pieces, each resembling a modern cotter pin. Each piece is a wire folded to form an

133

eye with two long, parallel prongs. The prongs were nailed into wooden door frames
and spread apart to lock them in place, leaving the interlocking eyes exposed in the
door jam (Simmons and Turley 1980:135–136).
PAI excavations produced two snipe hinges (Figure 5.1). Neither is in pristine
condition. The first (Lot 4) consists of only one element and resembles a small hook.
The construction of the item is clear in that a long piece of wrought wire was doubled
up to form an eye at one end; the other end was bent at a 90º angle. The wire is
wrought (hammered into a squared thread) and would have had an original length
of approximately 78.8 mm. The piece is 28.2 mm long including the eye, which is
9.1 mm on the exterior. The bent end measures roughly 11 mm long, making the
original spike length approximately 39 mm prior to the 90º bend in the prong. The
piece may have served as a hook or latch for a small box or chest. It appears that
the prong was hammered through a piece of wood about 20 mm thick and bent back
for anchoring.
Figure 5.1
The second specimen (Lot 266) is a heavily
rusted and mutilated piece that appears at first to be
a
a globular mass of barbs from a barbed wire. But on
close inspection, two perfectly circular intertwined
eyes are evident. One eye loop measures 10.4 mm on
the exterior, while the other is 10.8 mm. The prongs

truncated with a length of 23.7 mm including the

been twisted at the point at which they emerge from
the first eye and have rusted away with no indication
of the original length.

TTU’s excavations recovered two snipe
hinges. The 1994 excavations recovered one with an
“overall length of 6.8 cm including the eye” (Hall and
Gilmore 1995:32), and the snipe hinge from the 1997
excavations was 4.5 cm long and 0.2–0.4 cm wide and
tapered from 0.21 to 0.15 cm (McWilliams 2001:73).

TTU’s excavations at Presidio San Sabá
recovered two snipe hinges (Norment 2007:55). One is complete (two interlocking
pieces) and measures 4 cm long, and the second is only half of a hinge measuring
4 cm long.
Knife Bolster
PAI excavations recovered one iron knife bolster (Lot 144; Figure 5.2).
Pocketknives, also called penny knives, have not changed form significantly since
the eighteenth century (and even before), and this piece may be of Spanish origin
(Aaron Norment and Robert Norment, personal communication 2007). This specimen
is not brass, indicating that it probably was not a personal item of the padres at the
mission, but such an item would have been part of a soldier’s cartouche box used

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
to carry ammunition in colonial times. Soldiers on duty at the mission during the
time of the attack probably would have had pocketknives.
Figure 5.2
The bolster is oblong with one straight
and one rounded end. It measures 30.7 mm
long and tapers from 16.4 to 13.5 mm before
rounding off at the end. No decoration can be
discerned on the surface since the artifact is
highly rusted. The opposite side, which would

straight end, is broken near the backside face,
and only ca. 2 mm remain.
No other knife bolsters are reported from previous work at the mission
or presidio. Tunnell (1969:67) reports a knife blade fragment from excavations at
Mission San Lorenzo. The blade is 2.6 cm wide and reaches 4 mm thick, and the
fragment is 1.5 cm long.
Spikes, Nails, and Tacks
Spikes, nails, and one tack were differentiated based on head size and shaft
thickness. Citing measurements provided in tables (converted to millimeters), Hall
and Gilmore (1995:33) categorized wrought spikes as having head diameters over
15 mm and a maximum shank thickness over 6 mm (both wrought spikes in the
1995 report have a shank thickness of 7 mm). Complete nail specimens fell between
61 and 79 mm in length, with head diameters ranging from 9 to 14 mm and shaft
thickness ranging from 4 to 6 mm. PAI excavations recovered three wrought-iron
spikes, six wrought-iron nails, and one tack (Table 5.2; Figure 5.3).
SPIKES
The single complete spike measures 80.7 mm. All three have rectangular
shanks, and each has a different head. One has a triangular head and may have
been intended for decoration, or it is possible that part of the head broke or rusted
off. Two have rectangular heads, but one is centered on the shank and one is not
and is called a “seven” spike (Harris and Harris [1974:76], as cited in McWilliams
[2001:75]).
Nineteen spikes were recovered in TTU’s excavations. Two from 1994 have
diamond-shaped heads interpreted as decorative (Hall and Gilmore 1995:33). One
is complete and measures 100.1 mm in length, and the incomplete specimen is only
4 mm long. The shank thickness on both is 7 mm, and head diameters range from
17 to 18 mm (Hall and Gilmore 1995:33). The 1997 excavations produced 13 spikes
(McWilliams 2001:75). Six are long (7.8–11.7 cm) with very large semirectangular,
ornamental heads (1.5–2.0 cm wide). Their shanks are 0.5–0.7 cm wide. Seven others

are similar to the long spikes but smaller. They range in length from 3.6 to 5.1 cm,
in shank width from 0.4 to 0.6 cm, and in head width from 1.0 to 1.8 cm.
NAILS
Four of the six nails are complete, ranging in length from 36.3 to 48.8 mm.
Five have square shanks, and one has a rectangular shank. Three or four heads
are rectangular with rounded corners and appear to have peaked at the center of
the head, and one head has been misshapen beyond recognition. The heads of five
of the specimens are centered on the shank, while one specimen is off center (i.e.,
a “seven” nail).
TTU’s excavations recovered 47 nails, 29 from the 1993–1994 excavations and
18 from the 1997 excavations (Hall and Gilmore 1995:33–40; McWilliams 2001:75).
They are classified as medium-sized nails (29 from the 1994–1995 excavations
and 9 from 1997) that range in length from 2.7 to 6.0 cm and in shank thickness

137

138

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
from 0.3 to 0.6 cm. In addition, 4 wrought nail shank fragments were recovered
from the 1997 excavations. McWilliams (2001:75) also describes 9 “long thin nails
with small heads” from the 1997 excavations. These were categorized as mission
artifacts because most were curled at the ends, which is common in Spanish colonial
assemblages. Many of these types of nails were recovered during the PAI excavations,
but these were determined to be wire nails that postdate ca. 1890. Consequently,
the TTU specimens, although rusted and somewhat square in appearance, probably
are actually wire nails that do not date to the Spanish occupation.
The presidio assemblage includes 163 nails ranging from 1.8 to 10.5 cm in
length and head diameters ranging from 0.5 to 2.3 cm (Norment 2007:54). Of these,
25 were bent at a 90º angle, indicating that they had been driven through wood with
the protruding end hammered flush with the wood (Norment 2007:54).
Tunnell (1969:67) reports 24 nails from Mission San Lorenzo, stating, “The
heads are flattened, ovoid in outline, and usually not centered on the shaft.” One
“extra long specimen has a very thick, many-faceted head” (Tunnell 1969:67); it
may be what McWilliams (2001:75) describes as “ornamental spikes.” Tunnell’s
nails range from 4.5 to 12.5 cm in length and 3–8 mm in shaft thickness, with heads
ranging from 1 to 2.2 cm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness. He also notes that many
of the specimens had been driven through boards ranging from 3.0 to 7.9 cm thick.
TACK
The single tack has a shaft length of 20.8 mm and shaft thickness of 4  mm
square. The head is mutilated but has a maximum length of 9.3 mm. TTU’s 1993–
1994 excavations did not produce any tacks, but the 1997 assemblage includes six
tacks and tack fragments (McWilliams 2001:76). These range in length from 18 to
20 mm and have shanks that range from 3 to 4 mm in thickness with head widths
ranging from 4 to 9 mm. Although Norment (2007:54) does not report tacks in TTU’s
excavations at Presidio San Sabá, nails as short as 18 mm are reported and could
include tacks.
Lead Artifacts
PAI excavations recovered 21 pieces of lead from six proveniences, but only
20 of these are considered to be Spanish colonial (Table 5.3; Figure 5.4). The total
weight is 160.8 g (including the modern item), with individual specimens ranging
from 0.7 to 32.6 g. Dimensions of individual artifacts range from 11.51 to 59.87 mm.
None have the appearance of musket balls. Most are misshapen blobs or small scrap
fragments that were probably intended for remolding. For the 1997 TTU collection,
McWilliams (2001:77) observes that “Pieces were then shaped into various functional
forms including shot, musket balls, seals, caps and lids. Some of these melted pieces
may have been the excess lead sprues that are clipped off in the making of lead
musket balls. These would have been small and would have melted easily.”
Most of these specimens appear to have been heated and probably melted
when the mission was attacked and burned. As a result, they took on the shape of
whatever surface or object they melted onto. The majority are flat pieces (n = 14),

* Twenty of the lead specimens are considered to be Spanish colonial artifacts, but the Lot 294-1 specimen is not.
It is a flat triangular piece of cut lead that has a modern wire nail (iron) running through it, so that the lead
piece may have functioned like a washer. Following the lead isotope analysis, this specimen was determined to
be modern lead (see Chapter 6).

and one is a folded melted blob. Other forms include three-dimensional globular
pieces (n = 3) and flat lead sheeting (n = 3). The sheeting pieces are the only ones
that do not have characteristics of melting. The edges of these pieces are angled
and clearly cut with scissors or tin snips.
A modern wire nail was hammered through one of the larger thin flat pieces
(Lot 294). The lead is from 3.1-mm-thick sheeting and was cut into a triangular
piece; cut marks are clear on all three sides. The nail is a 4 1/2-inch-long, modern
wire nail (0.20–0.22 inches, or 4 gauge). The lead cannot be separated from the
nail, and both were weighed together. The nail’s estimated weight (19.7 g) was then
subtracted from the total. Hence, the lead specimen weighs approximately 12.3 g. In
Table 5.1, this artifact is included with the Modern and Recent Historic Materials
rather than the Spanish colonial materials.
All 21 of the lead artifacts were sourced using ICP-MS lead isotope analysis
(see Chapter 6). Twenty were identified as being from Mexican lead sources and are
considered to be mission-related artifacts. The thin lead with attached nail (Lot 294)

was found to be from a different source. The geochemical evidence suggests that
this piece is not associated with the mission occupation, and it probably represents
modern lead used as a nail washer.
The elevation ranges of the lead artifacts are extremely tight. All came from
99.90–99.80 m (n = 3, or 14 percent) or 99.00–99.90 (n = 18, or 86 percent). The

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
lead is concentrated within the burn zone just below Feature 13, the horizontally
extensive ash lens representing the mission-burning event.
TTU’s 1993–1994 excavations produced 19 pieces of melted lead totaling
217.05 g. These ranged in weight from 0.9 to 59.4 g and length from 1.4 to 6.5 cm
(Hall and Gilmore 1995:43–44). TTU’s 1997 excavations produced 104 pieces of
colonial period lead (McWilliams 2001). The collection includes 27 musket balls (23
of which were spent or previously fired) ranging from 1.45 to 2.7 cm in diameter. It
also includes 69 melted amorphous pieces and a bag of residual scrap lead collected
as one sample weighing 17.1 g. TTU’s presidio excavations produced many lead
artifacts, including seals (n = 6), disks (n = 16), cube-shaped pieces (n = 9), gaskets
(n = 3), and sprues (n = 56) (Norment 2007:35–36, 56–59). The collection also includes
musket balls (n = 66), none of which had been previously fired (Norment 2007:35).
Lead “disks,” on the other hand, are interpreted as possible musket balls hammered
down into disks to serve as makeshift gunflint pads (Norment 2007:28). Deagan
(2002:261–262) suggests that similar lead disks may have served as weights. The
lead cubes are “too small to be ingots,” according to Norment (2007:59). Steven
Schooler (Norment 2007:59) suggests that some of the lead objects may have served
as writing utensils.
Ceramics
PAI excavations recovered 37 ceramic sherds of known Spanish colonial
origin, including majolica (n = 26), olive jar (n = 10) and burnished redware (n = 1)
(Table 5.4). Native-made ceramics also appear in the collection (n = 4) and are
discussed under Probable Spanish Colonial Artifacts below, as are one sherd of saltglazed whiteware and a porcelain sherd. All of the ceramics discussed below were
analyzed and described following the protocols established in the TxDOT Ceramic
Standards and Guidelines, Version 2.0 (Texas Department of Transportation 2010).
This document also established the procedures for sampling ceramics that were
sent to the University of Missouri Research Reactor for neutron activation analysis.
Majolica
Three categories of majolica were identified: Blue on White (n = 14),
Huejotzingo (n = 5), and Undecorated (n = 7). Subdividing these majolicas was
difficult. The categories are nebulous and overlap considerably. For example, all of
the majolica sherds could be categorized as Blue on White vessels, since Huejotzingo
is a subcategory of Blue on White, and the undecorated sherds might actually belong
to Blue on White or Huejotzingo vessels, since the latter is defined simply by blue
paint on the rim.
McWilliams (2001:78) provides an overview of majolica:
Majolica is a thin-walled, wheel-thrown glazed ceramic with a soft
paste coated with an opaque enamel. Forms include plates, bowls,
and cups (tazas). Also referred to as Mexican lead glazed ware,
Mexican faience, and Talavera (Schuetz 1969:52–57) this ceramic
type carried over from the Old World. Majolica producing kilns were
established in Mexico by 1550 (Deagan 1987:71). The industry was

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
established by Dominican friars who brought the tradition from
Talavera de la Reina, Toledo, Spain. The enterprise was highly
successful and a potter’s guild was established by the middle of
the fifteenth century (Barber 1911; Schuetz 1969:54). Most of the
majolica distributed in the circum-Caribbean area was produced
in either Puebla, Mexico or Mexico City (Deagan 1987:71; Lister
and Lister 1974). Tin-glazed earthenware was also being produced
in Aguas Caliente, Dolores, Hidalgo, and Guanajuato (Schuetz
1969:54). Extensive descriptions of tin enameled earthenware from
San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo) can be found in Tunnell (1966).
Majolica was manufactured in two grades: fine-grade with a redcolored paste and an average thickness of 0.5 cm and commongrade with a lighter pinkish-tan paste (Lister and Lister 1982;
Deagan 1987:72). Most of the samples from the San Sabá Mission
are classified under the common grade due to the light pinkish-tan
paste. The only exception may be Style #8 due to its thinness that
ranges from 0.5–0.6 cm.
The PAI collection consists of rim fragments (n = 8), body fragments (n = 16),
and footring fragments (n = 2). Rim fragments are classified as Blue on White (n = 3)
and Huejotzingo (n = 5). It was often difficult to distinguish between an intentional
overlapping of blue pigment onto the opposite side of the rim and a little bit of slop
that happened to make it over the rim slightly. Finding fitted pieces helped to prove
that some of the painted rim sherds were not intentional but were simply a case of
sloppy or imperfect decoration. Once a fragment from slightly beneath the rim was
refit, Puebla Blue on White floral decorations were connected with what appeared
to be a Huejotzingo rim fragment.
TTU’s 1997 excavations produced 95 majolica sherds (McWilliams 2001:77–
80). These were categorized into 11 decorative styles and subdivided based on the
portion of the vessel from which they originated (i.e., rim, panel, and body). Based
on results from PAI excavations, these 11 stylistic categories have been condensed
into three basic style types: Huejotzingo Blue on White, Puebla Blue on White, and
Undecorated.
PUEBLA BLUE ON WHITE
PAI excavations produced 13 sherds of Puebla Blue on White (Figure 5.5).
Two sherds are rims, and 11 are body fragments. Puebla Blue on White is reportedly
the most geographically widespread majolica in the New World (Deagan 1987:83;
Fox and Ulrich 2008:80). Puebla Blue on White sherds were recovered at most
Spanish colonial sites in Texas, according to Fox and Ulrich (2008:80). They are
decorated with light and dark blue images of flowers or a crane encircled by dots,
lines, and lobes. Decorations are found on the inside and outside of vessels, with
interior decorations more common on plates and bowls and exterior designs on cups.
Rims are typically decorated with “two blue bands below the rim from which are
suspended groups of single blue petals alternating with single blue flowers” (Fox
and Ulrich 2008:80). Vessel forms include “deep, brimmed plates (platos), small cups
(tazas, pocillos) and bowls (soperos) with everted rims [rare and somewhat early

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
in Texas]…jars (jarros), vases, inkwells, figurines, basins of various types, and tile”
(Fox and Ulrich 2008:80). Fox and Ulrich (2008:80) report a thickness range from
4 to 6 mm within the same vessel. Dates and locations of manufacture are difficult
to determine since similar designs were produced throughout Mexico beginning in
Puebla as early as 1700. The temporal range of Puebla Blue on White found in San
Antonio is from the 1720s to 1760s (Fox
and Ulrich
2008:80; Ivey and Fox 1999:42).

Figure 5.5. Puebla Blue on White majolica sherds.

TTU’s 1997 excavations produced seven styles that probably fall under
Puebla Blue on White (McWilliams 2001:79–80):
Decorative Style #1 (28 sherds). Sherds are 0.3 cm thick and are
painted with a bright blue stripe 0.3 cm below the rim. The blue
stripe is 0.6 cm thick followed by a 0.3–0.5 cm unpainted space,
followed by a thin medium-light blue line. Sherds consisted of rims,
panel decorated, and body sherds. These sherds are all burned to
some degree. Nine rim …, seventeen panel …, and 2 body sherds
were collected.
Decorative Style #2 (5 sherds). Sherds have a light to medium dull
blue band measuring 0.7 cm thick, 0.4 cm below the rim followed
by a 0.1 cm space, with a 0.2 cm dull blue band and large dark, dull
blue floral design. Four rim sherds … and one panel sherd … were
collected.
Decorative Style #6 (8 sherds) is slightly cream colored and mostly
undecorated with the exception of a few light dull blue lines and a
bright blue floral decoration. These sherds are not burned. Also, one
sherd has a pontil mark on its interior surface. Six sherds are from
the body of the vessel.
Decorative Style #7 (2 sherds) is painted with a dull greenish blue
or dull aqua and is 0.4 cm thick. One rim sherd … and one body
sherd … are represented.

146

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Decorative Style #8 (8 sherds) is 0.50–0.6 cm thick (the thickest
majolica example at this mission). Sherds are mostly undecorated
with the exception of a few which are painted with a dark, dull blue
floral and bright dark blue floral design. All eight sherds are from
the body of the vessel.
Decorative Style #9 (3 sherds) consists of portions of large, bright
blue floral designs. Sherds are 0.3 cm thick. These three sherds are
all from the body.
Decorative Style #10 (3 sherds) is speckled faintly with a light blue
paint. Sherds are marbled gray (burned) on the outside and grayish
cream colored on the inside. These sherds are 0.3–0.4 cm thick. The
sherds are all from the body.
HUEJOTZINGO BLUE ON WHITE
PAI’s excavations produced five sherds categorized as Huejotzingo Blue on
White (Figure 5.6). All are probably cup fragments. The cups were roughly 80 mm
in diameter. Huejotzingo decoration is limited to a single blue swath along and
overlapping the rim of the vessel. “The band is located on the inside rim of plates
and the outside rim of cups” (Fox and Ulrich 2008:82). This type is a variant or
possibly a subclass of Puebla Blue on White (Goggin 1968:196). Huejotzingo was
made throughout the eighteenth century and possibly through the 1850s and thus
is useful for dating (Fox and Ulrich 2008:82). Huejotzingo is commonly found in
Spanish colonial sites throughout Texas. According to Fox and Ulrich (2008:82), “The
lack of more complex decoration may indicate that this is a cheaper ceramic type.”
TTU’s 1997 excavations produced five sherds that match the description of
Huejotzingo Blue on White and were categorized as Decorative Style #5 (McWilliams
2001:79–80). McWilliams describes these sherds as “decorated with a bright blue

collected from the 2000–2002
TTU field schools at Presidio
San Sabá. Of the 304 tinenameled earthenwares
found, many types are not
representative of the Mission

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
San Sabá assemblage. Of the majolica types that overlap between the two sites,
the following were recorded from the presidio collections: Undecorated (n = 111),
Unidentified Blue on White (n = 85), Puebla Blue on White (n = 39), and Huejotzingo
Blue on White (n = 19) (Zayatz 2004:64–73). Majolica styles found at the presidio but
not at the mission include Blue on White with Black Accent (n = 13), Huejotzingo
Green (n = 1), San Agustín (n = 1), and numerous polychromes classified as San
Elizario (n = 10), Abó, (n = 2), and Unidentified (n = 19, which represents 14 different
styles) (Zayatz 2004:75–78).
Gilmore (1967:19–20) reports polychrome, blue, and undecorated tinenameled earthenwares from the presidio. She describes 21 majolica sherds with
“Blue Decoration” (Blue on White) ranging from 2.8 to 7 mm thick. The thinnest
specimens match the description of Huejotzingo with blue on the rim or 4–7 mm
below it. The paste ranged from light pink to cream. She also notes 9 undecorated
sherds ranging from 3.5 to 5.5 mm thick with similar paste (Gilmore 1967:20).
Majolicas collected from Presidio San Agustín de Ahumada in far southeast
Texas (occupied 1766–1771) are reported by Tunnell and Ambler (1967:27–32). In
total, 295 sherds from seven styles are described.
UNDECORATED
PAI’s excavations produced seven undecorated majolica sherds (Figure 5.7).
Two are footring fragments, and five are body fragments. Three sherds (Lots 72,
155, and 166) have an extremely faint bluish tint along one edge and/or exhibit tiny
blue spots. In the case of the footrings (Lots 155 and 166), this may be a result of
the glaze dripping down to the bottom of the vessels and settling prior to firing. Or
it is possible that this is a result of blue pigment being added, which would mean
these sherds are from Blue on White vessels rather than undecorated ones. The
undecorated ceramics could be Puebla Plain, a type of majolica commonly found at
Spanish colonial sites throughout Texas (Fox and Ulrich 2008:82).
TTU’s 1997 excavations produced 27 sherds that fall under the category of
undecorated majolica. McWilliams (2001) categorizes these into three decorative
styles, and three additional unidentified sherd fragments from these excavations
can be categorized as undecorated. McWilliams (2001:79–80) describes the following
undecorated sherds:
Decorative Style #3 is only represented by a single sherd (Lot 692).
It is the thinnest majolica example at this mission with a thickness
of 0.2 cm. This is a body sherd and is not decorated.
Decorative Style #4 (21 sherds) is an undecorated bowl basin. The
sherds are 0.35–0.4 cm thick. Style #4 may represent the basin of a
small bowl or cup. Several sherds have a deep bend or curve to
them. All twenty-one sherds are body sherds.
Decorative Style #11 (2 sherds) is a group of unknown and
unassociated sherds. These are undecorated body sherds and
measure 0.3 cm thick.

NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS
Nines majolica sherds were submitted for NAA and consisted of four sherds
of Puebla Blue on White, two sherds of Huejotzingo, and three undecorated. All
the sherds fell into a single composition group, suggesting they are all variations
of the same type made in the same location (see Group 6 in Appendix F). No other
Spanish ceramics in the NAA database matched the chemistry of this group. This
geochemical interpretation matches the visual interpretation stated earlier involving
refitting of Puebla Blue on White and Huejotzingo sherds. The geochemical data
indicates the two types were made in the same source area, and the visual evidence
suggests that these two types represent nothing more than different parts of the
same vessel in many cases.
Olive Jar
PAI excavations produced 10 olive jar sherds (Figure 5.8). McWilliams
(2001:81) provides an overview of the olive jar type:
Olive jar is a coarse, wheel thrown earthenware. These vessels
resemble the Mediterranean form called an amphora. Olive jar is
also called by its modern Spanish name anfora (Lister and Lister
1987:131–33), most likely a direct lineal descendant.
Olive jars were large ceramic containers with rounded bottoms
and small mouths. The containers were used to transport and store
liquids such as wine and vinegar, and also small victuals (foodstuffs)
(Marken 1994:42).

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
The appearance of olive jar sherds identifies and dates North
American sites to the Spanish colonial era (1490–1800) (Deagan
1987:31–35). Goggin (1964) established three ceramic divisions
of olive jar. The olive jar samples from the San Sabá Mission fall
under the Middle Style that is defined temporally between post1562 and pre-1600 to between 1750 and 1800 (Goggin 1964:24;
Hall and Gilmore 1995:47; Marken 1994:43). Deagan (1987:31–35)
simplified the dates of this Middle Period style from 1570 to 1780.
This time period encompasses the religious conquest of the frontier
lands of modern-day Texas.
Olive jar vessels were commonly coated with a green glaze on
both the interior and exterior or just the interior surface (Goggin
1964:11). Sherds from the San Sabá are glazed on both surfaces,
although some sherds show extreme wear on exterior surfaces.
The majority of the sherds from the PAI excavations are body fragments
(n = 8). One appears to be a fragment connecting the body to the neck, and one very
small sherd is unknown but may be from a neck based on the odd angle in which it
is broken. Sherds range in thickness from 7.1 to 13.5 mm and in maximum length
from 7.0 to 57.3 mm.
McWilliams (2001) reports 35 olive jar sherds from TTU’s 1997 excavations,
however, reanalysis identified an additional 3 sherds resulting in a total of 38.
McWilliams (2001) classifies the olive jar assemblage into two styles:
Style #1 (27 sherds). The interior surfaces range from a very pale
green (10G 8/2) to a more worn, lighter grayish green (10G 4/2).
Worn areas can be seen especially well on the wheel marks. The
paste ranges from pale reddish brown (10 YR 5/4) to a light brown
(5YR 6/4). The exterior of the vessel is dark brownish gray (5YR
4/1 N3) with vertical scratches and some grass impressions. Sherds
from Style #1 range in thickness from 0.9 to 1.4 cm.
Style #2 (8 sherds) have a dusky yellowish brown (10YR 2/2) to pale
brown (5YR 5/2) exterior. Interior color is pale olive (10 YR 6/2). The
paste is a moderate orange pink (10YR 7/4). Style #2 can further be
divided into style #2a (6 sherds) which has a more greenish, creamy
yellow glaze. Sherds from style #2a range in thickness from 0.7 to
1.35 cm. Style #2b (2 sherds) are more yellow with a darker, olive
green interior glaze (Lots 375, 471). These sherds are 1.0 and 1.2 cm
thick.
Based on these, most of the sherds from the PAI excavations fall under Style
#1 (n = 7), one falls under Style #2, and two are untypeable fragments (perhaps
Style #2).
TTU’s 1993–1994 excavations produced 11 olive jar sherds, although they
recognized that some sherds categorized as “Coarse Earthenware” may also fall into
this category but lack the distinctive green glaze (Hall and Gilmore 1995:46–47).
Sherds range from 1.0 to 1.3 cm thick. Hall and Gilmore (Hall and Gilmore 1995:47,
citing Deagan 1987:31–35) note that white slip on the exteriors of 4 sherds is
indicative of “the Middle Period of olive jar manufacture and use, dating from 1570
to 1780.” Reanalysis of the entire olive jar collection determined that McWilliams’s

Style #2 is similar to this Middle Period olive jar to which Hall and Gilmore were
referring.
Zayatz (2004:37–40) discusses two styles of olive jars from the TTU
excavations at the presidio. The first type, termed “Green Lead Glazed Earthenwares”
(n = 243), was intended to imitate the Spanish olive jar, and Zayatz (2004:37)
associates this type with the most common ceramic found in Spanish colonial sites
throughout Texas. Zayatz (2004:38) reports that these commonly have glaze on both
surfaces and that some retain blackened bases indicative of cooking use. She divides
these into Fine Paste (n = 53), Sandy Paste (n = 163), Coarse (n = 17), and Guanajuato
(n = 10) (Zayatz 2004:38–39). The second type of olive jar, a true Spanish olive jar,
was found at the presidio in significantly lower numbers (n = 6) (Zayatz 2004:61).
Gilmore (1967:20) reports 12 probable olive jar sherds from her 1967 work
at Presidio San Sabá. Categorized as “Lead glazed, Undecorated, green tint glaze,”
these sherds are described as having a coarse, dark gray paste with interior glaze
ranging from dark brownish green to light yellowish green. Some small areas of glaze
were observed on the exterior. These sherds had evidence of being wheel thrown
and ranged from 5 to 8 mm thick (Gilmore 1967:20–21).
Two styles of lead-glazed earthenware—probably olive jar or an imitation—
are reported from Presidio San Agustín de Ahumada by Tunnell and Ambler (1967).
Style 1 is a 5-mm-thick, sandy earthenware with a dark buff paste, glazed only the
interior (no color is given for the glaze). One strap handle was collected and thus
indicates a possible amphora shape. Style 2 was thought to be an olive jar, but the
sherds were lost and are not described (Tunnell and Ambler 1967:43).
Five olive jar sherds were submitted for NAA analysis (see Appendix F). The
sample consists of three sherds of Style #1 and two sherds of Style #2 and probable
Style #2. The two styles have distinctive chemical signatures indicating the type
distinction is valid. The three sherds of Style #1 are in Group 8, a small group that
includes only two other sherds from Mission Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los
Ais in east Texas. The two Style #2/probable Style #2 sherds are in Group 12, a small
group that has only one other sherd, also from Mission Dolores. All three of the
Mission Dolores sherds are classified generically as green lead-glaze earthenwares
that are probably from olive jars. The strong overlap between the sherds from
Mission San Sabá and Mission Dolores suggests these utilitarian vessels came from
the same sources and that the two missions were tied to the same supply network.
Burnished Redware
PAI excavations produced one sherd of burnished redware (Figure 5.9). This
sherd is a body fragment, but one edge flares out slightly, suggesting that it may
be a portion of a footring. It has a thickness of 9.5 mm and a maximum length of
43.4 mm.
Burnished redware plays an important role in New World Spanish colonial
ceramics. Much of our knowledge of the Spanish artifacts is based on materials
collected in Florida. Ceramics called burnished redware occur in Texas and

Florida, but these probably are not the same ceramic type. McWilliams (2001)
originally attributed the redware recovered by TTU to a common type described by
Deagan (1987:37–38):
Redware is identified by its uniform orange or brick-red earthenware
paste with minute mineral tempering. Redware vessels were
primarily utilitarian and common forms include vasos, tazas,
bacíns, librillo (wide bowl or basin), jarras, tinajas, and orzas (pearshaped jar). Redware vessels were produced throughout the New
World including Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico.
Puebla was a known production center in Mexico (Deagan 1987:38).
The exterior surface is smoothed (burnished) and some samples
have two undulating lines encircling the vessel. No examples of this
undulating line are found in the 1997 San Sabá collection, but two
sherds are described as “fluted.”
However, it seems that burnished redware may not be a single ceramic type,
but a broad category of Mexican-made wares from many different source areas that
share similar attributes. Schuetz (1969:52) notes that redware was produced in
Tlaxcala, Michoacán, and Jalisco. Fox and Ulrich (2008:44) state that the distribution
of red burnished ware “appears to be restricted to Texas.” These sources suggest
there are different types of redware and that the San Sabá variety is not directly
comparable to the Florida redware described by Deagan (1987:37–38).
TTU’s 1993–1994 excavations produced four burnished redware sherds, and
they ranged in thickness from 0.6 to 0.8 cm (Hall and Gilmore 1995:47). TTU’s 1997
excavations produced eight burnished redware sherds. McWilliams (2001:82–83)
reports six sherds, but two additional sherds were identified during reanalysis.
Sherds range in thickness between 0.6 and 1.2 cm.
TTU’s excavations at the presidio produced 71 sherds of redware (Zayatz
2004:44–48). Zayatz (2004:44–48) divides redwares into four categories: Tlaxcalan
Redware or Burnished (n = 49), Mexican Painted (n = 3), Red Earthenware (n = 8),
and Red Wash (n = 11). Those found at the mission appear to match closely with
her description of the first of these.
Gilmore (1967:21) reports four unglazed burnished redware sherds from her
1967 investigations at Presidio San Sabá. She describes them as being medium dark

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
red in color with a high gloss. Two rim sherds have all of the interior and portions
of the exterior burnished, suggesting that unburnished sherds also may have been
present. Gilmore (1967:21) states that these wares are common at Spanish colonial
sites. Based on Greer’s (1967) Alamo work, Gilmore believes these burnished
redwares were made in Mexico.
Redware has been recovered at other Spanish missions in Texas. Tunnell
describes a ceramic identical to the redware found at Mission San Sabá from Mission
San Lorenzo (1762–1771). Thirty-six specimens were categorized as a “Dark Red,
Polished Plainware” (Tunnell 1969:77). Tunnell and Ambler (1967:24–25) report
three burnished redware sherds from Presidio San Agustín de Ahumada (1766–
1771). These range in thickness from 6 to 9 mm.
One additional ceramic type deserves mention here. Two sherds of Galera,
a fine-paste lead-glazed ware (also called West Mexico Polychrome; see Schuetz
[1969:50-51] and Fox and Ulrich [2008:50]) were collected from Mission San Sabá by
TTU in 1993. This polychrome ware has multiple colors (e.g., black tan, and green)
painted on a burnished or slipped redware. No Galera sherds were identified in the
PAI collection.
Two of the burnished redware sherds were submitted for geochemical
sourcing by NAA, and they both are in Group 2 (see Appendix F). This is a large
group consisting of 27 sherds of lead-glazed earthenwares and Mexican-made
redwares or red-slipped wares from Mission San Sabá, Mission San Lorenzo,
Mission San Juan in San Antonio, Mission Rosario in south Texas, and Mission
Dolores in east Texas.
Glass
PAI excavations produced 16 pieces of Spanish-era glass classified as
container glass (n = 6), flat glass (n = 2), and Spanish trade beads (n = 8) (Table 5.5).
McWilliams (2001) reports bottle glass, window glass, and glass beads collected by
TTU in 1997. These include bottle glass (5 light green, 10 medium green, 11 dark
green, 14 clear, and 2 amber), 10 pieces of flat glass, and 52 beads (McWilliams
2001:86). Three of the glass pieces in the 1997 TTU collection appeared to be flaked
(McWilliams 2001:86). The PAI excavations produced 9 pieces of flaked glass, but
the glass was determined to be from a panel-style bottle that was not produced until
later. These flaked glass specimens are discussed later (see Chipped Historic Glass).
Container Glass
The six pieces of container glass range from 3.0 to 5.3 mm thick and 14.7
to 33.9 mm in maximum length. This glass is coated with ca. 0.5 mm of patina on
each surface, and no light penetrates through to the glass. To determine the color,
one small corner of each fragment was scraped with a razor blade. Five are light
green, and one very small sherd is thought to be amber. The collection consists of
one possible base fragment (possibly a kickup; Lot 172) that is melted, two neck
fragments, a body fragment from a very large container, and two fragments from
unknown parts of a container (Figure 5.10).

TTU’s 1993–1994 excavations produced four pieces of Spanish colonial
container glass (Hall and Gilmore [1995:49] report six, but two fragments were
determined to be flat glass during reanalysis). These are mostly opaque with the
exception of one clear specimen. Most are described as “relatively flat and angular,”
and one piece is thought to be a U-shaped portion of a bottle or perhaps distorted

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
by heat (Hall and Gilmore 1995:49). TTU’s 1997 excavations produced 73 pieces
of Spanish bottle glass (McWilliams [2001:86] reports 68, but 5 fragments were
identified during reanalysis). Twenty-six are light green, 10 are medium green,
12 are dark green, 14 are clear, 3 are amber, and 22 are unknown. An additional 5
sherds of olive green glass lack patination indicative of aged glass, but 3 of these
are flaked (McWilliams 2001:86).
Tunnell (1969:106) reports 64 pieces of glass from Mission San Lorenzo,
of which 31 are pale green bottle glass, 8 are pale green flat glass, 2 are colorless
bottle glass, and 23 are pale blue-green small bottle glass. For all these, Tunnell
was uncertain about their association with the Spanish occupation.
Flat Glass
Two flat clear glass fragments are included in the Spanish colonial category
because they are believed to be part of a larger broken piece collected by TTU in
1997 (Figure 5.11). The two specimens are 3.0 and 3.1 mm thick. One (Lot 216) is
rectangular with two distinctly straight edges, one unevenly straight edge, and one
unevenly concave edge. The two straight sides have sharply cut faces, while the
other two have poorly cut sinuous edges. The other (Lot 295) has two perpendicular
Figure 5.11
straight edges and an irregular opposite edge.
In the 1997 TTU collection, McWilliams
(2001:87) identified 10 pieces of flat glass (along with
2 additional pieces found during reanalysis), and
describes them as follows: “These range from 2–4 mm
thick. Several have cut-marks and one has a slightly
rounded internal edge, possibly indicating that these
pieces may have been part of a design such as a leaded
window panel or stained glass window.” This means
that all these flat clear glass pieces may be associated
with the Spanish mission occupation.

Glass Beads
PAI excavations produced eight trade beads or fragments of beads (Figure
5.12; Table 5.6). Harris and Harris (1967) was used as a primary comparison for this
analysis, based on analysis of TTU’s 1997 collection (McWilliams 2001). Harris and
Harris (1967) define the following bead size categories: large, over 0.6 cm; medium,
0.4–0.6 cm; small, 0.2–0.4 cm; and extra small, 0–0.2 cm. All of PAI’s specimens are
in the large category, ranging from 7.6 to 9.9 mm in diameter and 8.6 to 10.6 mm
in maximum length (with the exception of one irregular misshapen bead that is
15.9 mm long). Seven are the common round or ovoid peacock blue. Five of these
match Harris and Harris’s (1967:140) Type 10 description: “Large, Peacock Blue,
opaque, barrel-shaped necklace bead of simple construction. The glass has fine
lines running lengthwise with the bead, giving it a texture reminiscent of stripped
sugarcane.” Two of the five are broken in half. One of the peacock blue specimens
matches Harris and Harris’s Type 9 bead, while the seventh one may be Type 9 or 10.

155

156

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Type 9 beads are described as “Large, Peacock Blue, opaque, elongated, olive-shaped
necklace bead of simple construction. The glass has fine lines running lengthwise
with the bead, giving it a texture reminiscent of stripped sugarcane” (Harris and
Harris 1967:140). All of the peacock blue beads are malformed or asymmetrical
due to manufacturing flaws, but they are not distorted due to burning. They may
be rejects and so may help to define trash midden areas within the site. PAI’s
excavations produced one complete dark cobalt blue, faceted bead. It matches Harris
and Harris’s (1967:143) Type 40: a “large, Bluebird Blue, translucent, eight-faceted
necklace bead of mandrel-wound, pressed facet, simple construction. The surface
of the glassFigure
sometimes
5.12 appears frosted, probably due to age.”

TTU’s 1993–1994
excavations produced two beads
and a unidentified melted glass
piece. One blue glass bead is fivesided with a length and thickness

of 9 mm. A second specimen “is

Finally, a melted piece of cobalt
blue glass was collected. Hall and
Gilmore (1995:50) describe this piece as intentionally twisted. While it may be a
bead, they interpreted at as a finger ring fragment based on its curvature.
TTU’s 1997 excavations produced 170 glass beads (McWilliams [2001:87–90]
analyzed 52 beads, but an additional 118 green seed beads were found at TTU long
after her analysis). All but 1 are simple hollow-cane beads that typically have linear
sugarcane-like striations. The exception is a compound hollow-cane green glass
bead with red outer covering called a Cornaline d’Aleppo, comparable to Type 99
in Harris and Harris (1967:147). Peacock blue (n = 16) is the most common color.
Green (n = 12) is also common, but there are four or five different styles of green
beads. One green bead had four facets and does not match any descriptions in Harris
and Harris (1967).
Tunnell (1969:106) reports 132 beads of 12 distinct types from Mission San
Lorenzo. In addition to glass, he reports amber, alabaster, coral, and pearl beads.
Tunnell (1969:108) notes that the glass bead collection is made up of three size
groups: large, about 9 mm; medium, about 5 mm; and small, about 3 mm. All are
either simple hollow-cane or compound hollow-cane construction. The collection
includes red compound (n = 29; similar to the specimen collected in 1997 called
Cornaline d’Aleppo), small compound (n = 6), blue-green medium (n = 4), small simple
blue (n = 16), small simple dark burgundy (n = 33), small simple clear (n = 20), and
small compound white (n = 6) (Tunnell 1969:109–111).

Basalt Ground Stones
PAI excavations produced four pieces of vesicular basalt that are fragments of
ground stone implements, either manos or metates. Although the exact source of the
raw material is not known, the fragments are almost certainly of Mexican origin and
probably represent grinding tools made by Spaniards or Indians in Mexico. Basalt
grinding tools would have been manufactured near the quarry and transported as
finished tools. Two fragments were found during the PAI testing phase. The first
is a large, square angular fragment from TU 10 (Lot 33) and has a flat to concave,
well-worn grinding face remnant on one side. Judging by the thickness, it is probably
a metate fragment. The second fragment recovered during test excavations was
found in TU 3 (Lot 14). Although it does not have a remnant wear facet, the exterior
surface does appear to exhibit traces of pecking and shaping. It may represent a
leg or support fragment of some type of grinding implement such as a metate or
molcajete. Both can have leg supports fashioned as part of the implement; metates
may have three or four legs, and molcajetes have three legs.
Two smaller fragments were recovered during data recovery excavations in
the same general area. The first piece (from Unit BW16, Lot 306-1) is an angular
fragment retaining a portion of a convex wear facet, suggesting it may be a mano
fragment. Based on the location of wear, this may be an end/side portion of the
mano. The last fragment (found in Unit BW13, Lot 297-2) is tentatively identified

157

158

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
as a support or leg fragment similar to the TU 3 specimen. It appears to have been
pecked and battered to a general shape, but there are no traces of grinding wear.
Four vesicular basalt fragments were found at the mission in the 1993
TTU investigations, and five fragments were recovered in 1997. Two appeared to
be metate fragments, and one was likely a mano (Hall and Gilmore 1995:50–51).
The largest specimen is only 8.2 cm long. Review of the literature pertaining to
Spanish missions and mission-period sites in Texas revealed that ground stone
artifacts that can be attributed to Spanish manufacture or use are rare. Inman
(1999:369–371) illustrates a mano and metate fragment from Mission San Juan
Bautista in Guerrero, Mexico. The ground stone assemblage from that site includes
eight metate fragments of porous vesicular basalt, four mano fragments, and a twohanded mano fragment. Similar fragments of ground stone artifacts were recovered
from Mission San Bernardo (Inman 1999:376). Carlson and Corbin (1999:54) report
vesicular basalt metate leg fragments from Mission Dolores in Texas. Almaráz (1979,
1980) notes that ground stone implements were manufactured in Saltillo, Mexico,
and transported for trade to Mission San Juan Bautista. Metates also appear on
the lists of mission property and as household belongings given to Indian residents
at the mission (Almaráz 1980). A single basalt pestle is reported from Mission San
Francisco de la Espada in San Antonio (Chandler 1996:42–43). Few of the reported
basalt manos and metates from Spanish mission contexts in Texas are complete,
suggesting that, as missions were closed or mission populations moved around, these
important grinding tools were considered mobile and traveled with the occupants.
Gunflints
Gunflints and strike-a-lights recovered from Texas missions have been
identified as being of either European or Native American manufacture, with these
determinations based on raw material, technology, and overall size and shape.
Gunflints of European manufacture are usually distinctive in terms of shape,
technology, and raw material (Clarke 1935; Kenmotsu 1990; Witthoft 1966). French
and English gunflints may be identified by differences in morphology, manufacture,
and raw materials. Gunflints of Native American manufacture typically reflect
the use of locally available raw materials, were manufactured of recycled flaked
artifacts of suitable morphology (such as bifaces or unifaces), and were created using
traditional techniques such as biface technology or pressure flaking.
Three probable gunflints were recovered from the PAI excavations, two from
Unit AE9 and one from BW29 (Figure 5.13). Attributes recorded for these specimens
are length, width, thickness, and weight. The specimen in Lot 76 is a small fragment
of a chert flake from an unknown source with abrupt unifacial pressure or controlled
percussion flaking along two edges. It may represent a Native-made gunflint. Wear
is slight, and wear characteristic of use as a strike-a-light is present along one edge.
It is probable that this specimen initially functioned as a gunflint but was later
recycled as a strike-a-light flint.
The specimen from Lot 77 is more easily identified as a gunflint. This artifact
is a proximal or truncated medial section of a chert blade or percussion flake with

abrupt percussion retouch along three edges and use wear on two edges. The stone
is reminiscent of gray cherts of French gunflints recovered from Fort St. Louis (Jeff
Durst, personal communication 2009), and thus it may be a fragmentary European
gunflint. Edge wear on this specimen consists of unifacial crushing, small step
fractures, and edge blunting. This type of edge modification is reminiscent of damage
produced by use as a strike-a-light (Jeff Durst, personal communication 2009), and
this specimen may also be a worn-out gunflint recycled as a strike-a-light flint. The
third specimen is from Lot 346, Unit BW29. It also appears to be a recycled biface
fragment of gray fine-grained chert, probably Edwards chert. The plan view shape
is triangular with wear along two edge facets. The wear characteristics indicate
that this item was a strike-a-light component.
Strike-a-Light Flints
The flint components of strike-a-light kits have only occasionally been
identified in Texas mission lithic assemblages (Tomka 1999a:250–251). Runnels
(1994) provides the best summary of these artifacts and their identification in
lithic assemblages. Although strike-a-lights can have a variety of morphologies
and can even be recycled gunflints, end scrapers, or biface fragments, the most
useful identification characteristic is the distinctive wear pattern observed on many
specimens. Runnels (1994:11) notes the presence of areas of “bifacial and invasive
flaking with scattered splintering and crushing” on the edges. Oblique retouched

159

160

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
edges and overlapping wear facets are also characteristic. Iron particles or iron
streaks may sometimes be observed. On two strike-a-light flints at Mission San
Jose, Tomka (1999a:250–251) notes heavily crushed and step-fractured edges with
fracture scars longer and more invasive than typically observed on gunflints. One
of these is a tertiary blade, and another is a thick secondary flake.
Two specimens in the PAI lithic assemblage are classified as strike-a-light
flints (see Figure 5.13). One (Lot 78) from Unit AE9 is made of light and dark gray
banded, fine-grained chert with remnant yellow surface patina and a small patch
of weathered cortex and surface patina. Use wear is along 90º edges of the piece,
and the wear is characterized by abrasion and multiple overlapping step and hinge
fractures with rounded and abraded facets. Previous flake scars and the presence of
patina indicate that this specimen may have been a biface or bifacial core fragment
recycled for use as a strike-a-light.
The second strike-a-light (Lot 151) was recovered from Unit AW4, Feature
10, the same cultural feature that contained the Perdiz arrow point. This artifact
is intensively burned, most likely during the mission destruction episode. It was
manufactured of local Edwards chert and appears to retain some cortex on the
dorsal surface. The piece is a thick flake fragment and has a pronounced concave
worn area on one edge identical to that on the other strike-a-light. Some traces of
this wear are also present on both ends of the artifact in the form of heavy abrasion
and multiple overlapping step and hinge fractures that exhibit rounded and abraded
facets along the edge. This edge wear approaches 90º and is distinctly different from
use wear associated with scraping hides or other materials.
Native-Made Artifacts in Spanish Colonial Contexts
This section describes five artifacts—one arrow point and four ceramic
sherds—that were undoubtedly made by Native Americans but are considered to
be associated with the mission occupation because of their archeological contexts.
Most of the Native-made lithic artifacts are discussed separately (see Native-Made
Lithics
Figure
5.14below) because they cannot be associated with any specific time period with
any degree of confidence.

A single Perdiz arrow point was found in Unit AW4
(Figure 5.14). Found with Feature 10 (see Chapter 11), the
point is considered mission-related because of its association
with butchered remains of historic animals brought by the
Spanish. The point is bifacially worked and was manufactured
from a heat-treated gray/pink chert flake by pressure flaking.
Although one barb is missing from a bending fracture, this
artifact exhibits well-controlled pressure flaking and fine
serration along the lower half of each lateral blade edge.
Lateral blade edges are essentially straight, and barbs are
sharp. Stem lateral edges are slightly convex and contract to
a rounded point at the base of the stem.

Ceramics
Four sherds of probable Native-made ceramics were collected from the PAI
excavations49 (Figure 5.15). All four are body fragments, but two may be from the
neck region of a vessel. Sherds range from 20.7 to 46.5 mm in maximum length
and 7.6 to 10.9 mm in thickness. Two specimens (Lots 219 and 317) appear to have
angular fragments of bone temper (including black and white calcined pieces)
as well as rounded sand particles of various sizes. One sherd (Lot 289) has large
rounded sand temper and possible fragments of bone temper. One sherd (Lot 371)
has reddish brown subangular pieces in addition to rounded sand temper, and it
has little or no bone temper. Pastes include colors from pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) to
light gray (10YR 7/2) to very pale brown (10YR 8/2 to 7/4).

The identifications of these sherds are tentative, and the sherds were not broken to expose
fresh edges. Zayatz (2004:30–31) describes similar ceramics from Presidio San Sabá categorized
as Mexican-made plainwares. Tamra Walter (personal communication 2007) identified specimens
from Lots 289 and 371 as Mexican-made but the specimen from Lot 317 as Native-made.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
It is unclear whether TTU’s 1993–1994 excavations produced Native-made
ceramics. Hall and Gilmore (1995:47) report 22 sherds of coarse earthenware
ranging from 0.8 to 2.3 cm (including necks and rims). They suggest that a number
of these are probably olive jar sherds and that 10 were recovered from proveniences
suggestive of Spanish occupation. The remaining 12 sherds are not described.
TTU’s 1997 excavations recovered Native-made ceramics that are similar
to those collected during PAI’s work. McWilliams (2001:84) divides Native-made
sherds into three groups: bone temper alone, bone and carbon (carbonized/burned
bone) temper, and sand or no obvious temper. Bone-tempered ceramics (n = 11)
range in thickness from 0.4 to 1.5 cm. Bone- and carbonized bone–tempered
ceramics (n = 4) range in thickness from 0.8 to 1.2 cm. And very fine sand temper
or no obvious temper (n = 4) range from 0.5 to 1.1 cm thick (McWilliams 2001:84).
Pastes range from reddish brown (10R 5/6) to orange pink (10R 7/4) to brown (5YR
5/4) (McWilliams 2001:84–85).
Zayatz (2004:26–29) reports 37 Native-made ceramic sherds from the TTU
excavations at the presidio.50 Noting that terms such as Goliad Ware and Leon Plain
have caused confusion, she subdivides these into six varieties of bone-tempered
ware: Native Brownware (n = 13), Two-toned wares (n = 3), Red Native Ware (n = 6),
Slipped Native Wares (n = 2), Washed Native Ware (n = 3), and Native Grayware
(n = 3). In addition, she identifies one type of sandy-paste plainware as Lipan Apache
Dark Gray Native Ware (n = 7).
Seven bone-tempered sherds from Mission San Sabá were subjected to
geochemical sourcing using NAA, and the results are reported in Appendix F. Six
of the sherds have abundant bone temper and constitute a separate NAA source
group (19) that has no other sherds. These are probably some variation of Goliad
Plain, but it is not possible to determine their source. The seventh sherd was not
assigned to any chemical group. This NAA study also included five bone-tempered
sherds from Presidio San Sabá. Four of the presidio sherds are unassigned, while the
fifth sherd is in another chemical group (Group 16) that contains many plainware
sherds from Mission Refugio (41RF1).
Seven sherds from Mission San Sabá were submitted for petrographic
analysis, and the results of this study are reported in Appendix G. One is in
petrographic Paste Group 2, which contained no bone, while the other six are in
Paste Group 3 characterized by abundant poorly sorted bone. This data suggest
that, although all of these sherds are visually similar, they represent two different
source areas. These are the same seven sherds that were analyzed by NAA, and
the petrographic data support the NAA interpretations of two different types of
plainware at Mission San Sabá. The petrographic analysis also includes the same
five bone-tempered plainware sherds from Presidio San Sabá as the NAA study,
and the petrographic data lump all five presidio sherds into Paste Group 1, which
is different from all the Mission San Sabá plainwares.

The text lists 37 Native-made sherds, but a distribution table lists only 35 (Zayatz 2004:26–29,
Table 4.2).

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
PROBABLE SPANISH COLONIAL ARTIFACTS
A few categories of artifacts are thought to date to the mission occupation
but lack comparative artifacts from other sites to confirm their identification and
age. Many Spanish colonial sites were dug years ago, sometimes by archeologists
with limited knowledge of the culture. In some cases, if an artifact was not definitely
of Spanish origin, it was discarded and not described in the report. Many Spanish
colonial artifacts are difficult to discern from modern everyday objects. For example,
the snipe hinge (or Spanish gozne) is almost identical to a cotter pin and could easily
be mistaken for modern trash. Similarly, tin plates and skillets, cutlery, scissors,
terra-cotta ceramics, and some types of glass have changed very little over the
past 250 years (e.g., Noël Hume 1980:175, 182, 268). Many such objects, especially
fragmentary specimens, may be easily misidentified.
Artifacts in this probable category consist of chain links (n = 10), salt-glazed
stoneware (n = 1), and porcelain (n = 1). Although we do not know for certain that
these are mission-period artifacts, circumstantial evidence suggests they may be.
Their contexts support this interpretation (see Chapter 12).
Chain Links
PAI excavations produced 10 small chain links (Table 5.7; Figure 5.16). Nine
are of fine-gauge wire (1.4 mm), and one is of thicker-gauge wire (2.4 mm). All of
these links were created the same way and are generally rectangular to oval in shape.

Links identical to the finer-gauge (1.4-mm) links were collected during
the 1997 excavations (n = 45) and categorized as “Possible Mission Era Artifacts”
(McWilliams 2001:91; see Figure 12). McWilliams (2001:91) describes them as
follows:
These links were made from wire that was cut into 2.7–4.2 cm lengths.
Each wire length was then bent four times and the two overlapping
ends soldered together. Several links were still chained together

which at that time, he
suggested that the loops
served as attachments of
some sort. (Pictured Corbin et al. 1980:142 “h” “wire loops”). Two
more wire loops (1.0–1.8 cm in diameter) were reported from later
excavations (Corbin et al. 1990:79) which he suggests may have
attached higas or jinglers to a bridle or other part of saddlery. A
“handful of copper rings” were reported from excavations at Mission
Capistrano in San Antonio (Schuetz 1969:48). These artifacts were
identified as chain mail, since some were joined. Excavations
suggest that these specimens predate the nineteenth century.
Suggested functions for such thin chains include the following:
chains for binding (instead of rope), chains on balance scales, a chain
on survey instrument, bit chains (Simmons and Turley 1980:101,
Plate 7, upper row, middle bit). It may also be chain from chain
mail, although this is doubtful. The few links that were found in
situ were linked in a single strand rather than complex, joined mail.
Six classifications of completeness are used for these chain links: (1) a wire
segment with no bends; (2) a wire segment with one bend; (3) a wire segment with
two bends; (4) a wire segment with three bends; (5) a nearly complete link but without
the tongues overlapping to complete the link (i.e., it could not hold another link);
and (6) a complete link with the ends overlapping so that another link could not slip
out. It is possible that some of the partial chain links may have been intentionally
modified, perhaps pulled apart and straightened so they could be used for some
other function (as a pin or needle for example).
TTU’s 1993–1994 excavations recovered two trace chain links that Hall and
Gilmore (1995:40) reported under the heading “Miscellaneous Metal,” implying
that these were recent historic or modern artifacts. No description is provided.
TTU’s excavations at the presidio recovered eight links (Norment 2007:43–44), but
Norment associates these with horse tack. Based on the description and drawing,
these specimens are not similar to the chain links described above.

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
Salt-Glazed Stoneware
One sherd of salt-glazed stoneware was recovered from Unit AW22 (Figure
5.17). The paste is pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2), and the exterior is very pale brown
(10YR 8/3). Very small white inclusions are present but rare in the paste. The
exterior is glossy with the distinctive orange peel-like characteristic of salt-glazed
wares. One round pocket or bubble is devoid of glaze. The interior surface is similar
in finish but has prominent parallel undulations from having been wheel-thrown. A
second circular pocket or bubble devoid of glaze is found on the inside. The specimen
has a maximum length of 19.3 mm and a thickness of 3.7 mm. The curvature of the
body sherd denotes a vessel with a diameter of 50–60 mm, possibly a small cup. The
sherd was submitted for geochemical sourcing by NAA (see Appendix F). It does
have a distinctive chemical signature, but currently there are no eighteenth-century

thought to be a nineteenth-century ceramic
type in Texas, certain salt-glazed wares that are
found in mission and presidio sites are probably
associated with Spanish colonial occupations.

(Florida Museum of Natural History 2010). White
salt-glazed ceramics are also called “flint-ware”
because of the inclusion of crushed flint in the paste. They were produced in Europe as
early as the late 1600s, and by 1740 these stonewares were competing in popularity
with Chinese porcelain. By 1750, at least 50 potteries in Staffordshire, England,
were producing white salt-glazed stonewares, which were commonly exported to
the Americas (Hughes and Hughes 1968:142). Noël Hume (1980:114–118) provides
a good description of changes in English saltware production during the eighteenth
century.
Review of the literature concerning the possible presence of early European
salt-glazed wares at Spanish colonial sites in Texas is complicated by the fact that
salt-glazed wares became ubiquitous across most of the southern United States in
the nineteenth century. In Texas, local potters begin producing salt-glazed stonewares
in Marshall in 1842 and in Houston and San Antonio in 1849 (Greer 2010; Greer
and Black 1971). Reports of archeological investigations at Spanish sites in San
Antonio specifically mention stonewares produced by the Meyer pottery, which
has a characteristic green glaze resulting from the use of specific clays from Leon
Creek. However, the nineteenth-century Texas-made stoneware vessels are generally
thick and heavy, and they served as storage jars, crocks, and churns. They are quite
different than the fine, China-like stonewares from Germany and England.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Seventeen archeological reports on Texas mission and presidio sites were
examined, and, not surprisingly, some type of stoneware is mentioned in almost
every report. But in many reports, the stonewares are assumed to be modern and
not described. Several reports do describe a thin (generally 3–4 mm), pale-paste
stoneware with a transparent to pale brown or pale grayish brown salt glaze: Mission
San Sabá (previous TTU investigations and this report); Presidio San Sabá (Zayatz
2004:86–87); Presidio San Agustín de Ahumada (Tunnell and Ambler 1967:43–44);
Mission Dolores (Corbin et al. 1990:68–69); and Mission San Lorenzo (Tunnell
1969:101–102). These sites tend to span the entire period of Spanish occupation in
Texas, and, with the exception of Presidio San Agustín, overlap the 1757–1758 San
Sabá occupation. These stonewares are all likely candidates for European-made
wares used during the Spanish colonial period.
McWilliams (2001) identifies five sherds of fine salt-glazed ware from the
1997 TTU excavations, but she does not include descriptions. Reexamination of
the TTU specimens indicates that all five sherds match the salt-glazed sherd
recovered by PAI. Although they do not refit, these six sherds all appear to be from
the same vessel, a small finely made container such as a cup or inkwell. Two of
the fragments in the TTU collection have angles indicative of a sharply cornered
or squared-off body.
The TTU excavations at Presidio San Sabá produced one salt-glazed sherd
(Zayatz 2004:86). It is described as a compact yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) paste with
a gray carbon streak through the center. This may be an indication of “scratch-brown,”
a white salt glaze “sometimes incised with line decorations that were filled with an
iron oxide which fired brown” (Maryland Archaeological Conservation Lab 2009).
Scratch-brown salt-glazed ceramics date to the 1720s–1740s and are considered
relatively rare in colonial sites in Maryland. The Presidio San Sabá specimen has
a dark grayish brown interior, while the exterior has the characteristic orange-peel
effect and is greenish yellow. Zayatz (2004:87) dates the piece to 1740–1760 based on
the colored enameled surfaces and notes that “prior to this time, vessels remained
unglazed, and either dull white” or the natural color in firing resulting from the
atmosphere (citing Blacker [1922] and Starkey [1977]).
Gilmore (1967:22) reports one salt-glazed sherd from her 1967 investigations
at Presidio San Sabá. She describes it as a wheel-thrown gray to tan paste sherd
with greenish yellow salt glaze on the exterior. The sherd thickness is 7–10 mm,
and it was not considered to be part of the Spanish colonial assemblage. It is most
likely a nineteenth-century stoneware.
Tunnell and Ambler (1967:44) report 33 sherds of white salt-glazed stoneware
from Presidio San Agustín de Ahumada. The sherds seem to match those from the
PAI investigations and are described as follows:
The paste is very light tan in color, fine-grained and homogenous
in texture, and contains no obvious inclusions at a magnification of
30X. The sherds break with a smooth, straight fracture. The paste
hardness is about 5 to 6 on Moh’s scale and cannot be scratched
with a knife blade. All surfaces are coated with a transparent glaze
which has a uniform thickness of 0.1 mm. At a magnification of

Chapter 5: Artifact Analysis
about 30X numerous small bubbles can be seen beneath the surface
of the glaze. On many sherds some bubbles open onto the surface of
the glaze and give a slight pitted appearance to the surface.
All of these sherds are from shallow plates that ranged in thickness from 3 to
4 mm at the base to 3 to 6 mm along the rim (Tunnell and Ambler 1967:44–45). They
are highly decorated, with scalloped edges and molded designs on the interior faces.
Corbin et al. (1990:68–69) report five salt-glazed sherds from his 1984
excavations at Mission Dolores, occupied from 1722 to 1773. He describes the
paste of two “English Salt-Glazed” sherds as “very light grey to white in color and
exhibits the high degree of vitrification characteristic of stoneware. The glaze is a
thin, transparent salt glaze which contains numerous, small air bubbles” (Corbin et
al. 1990:68). A rim sherd and a small body sherd are noted as having the curvature
and thickness of hollowware vessels. Three of the “Salt-Glazed Stoneware” sherds
are described by Corbin et al. (1990:69) as being “from some type of thin-walled
stoneware vessel. The sherds have a thin transparent salt glaze on the exterior
surface. The paste color is 10YR8/1–7/1 (white to light grey). The interior of the
artifacts exhibits machine-turned lines.” Some aspects of both of these stoneware
types match the salt-glazed sherd recovered in the PAI excavations.
Tunnell (1969:101–102) reports one salt-glaze sherd from Mission San
Lorenzo and states that it “was produced in Staffordshire England, primarily in
the first half of the eighteenth century” (see Barber 1906:18–19, Plates 21, 22, and
23). He notes that “The very light tan paste shows through the transparent glaze.
Although this ware is called ‘white salt-glazed stoneware,’ it apparently is usually
a very light tan or gray in color.” The rim sherd is illustrated (Tunnell 1969:Figure
42-c), and it has a scalloped edge with a decorative interior rim band with an
engraved geometric design.
Porcelain
One sherd of white undecorated porcelain was recovered (Unit AW10, Lot
175). The fragment is 3.2 mm thick and is the vessel base with a footring and a
slight kick-up. A vertical extension coming off the base suggests that it is from a
small vertical-sided vessel or figurine.
McWilliams (2001:83) provides an overview of porcelain at colonial-era sites:
Oriental porcelain can be a component of Spanish colonial sites
(Deagan 1987:96). The Portuguese first began trade with China after
1516 and some porcelain may have reached the Caribbean Spanish
colonies between the 1550’s and 1570’s through illegal trade. After
1573, significant trade began by means of the Manila galleons that
traveled to the Philippines, a new Spanish colony (Deagan 1987:96).
TTU’s 1993–1994 excavations produced one vessel sherd and one doll leg
of white porcelain (Hall and Gilmore 1995:47). The 1997 excavations produced 14
porcelain sherds, but McWilliams (2001:83) states that it was not known if these
ceramics dated to the Spanish colonial occupation. These porcelain pieces include a
mold-poured doll leg and vessel fragments. While a doll may seem to be an unlikely

167

object in a mission context, “a ball of thread from a doll was reported in the salvage
trip made by Colonel Parrilla after the massacre” (McWilliams [2001:84] citing
Gilmore [1967:42]). However, Mariah Wade (personal communication 2011) recently
examined Gilmore’s translation of the salvage list and suggests that the word
Muñequilla (doll) is more suggestive of an amulet or talisman than a child’s doll.
NATIVE-MADE LITHIC ARTIFACTS OF
UNKNOWN ORIGIN
The total lithic assemblage from the PAI excavations consists of 660
specimens. Nine of these artifacts are described earlier in this chapter because they
are associated with the Spanish mission occupation. The remaining 651 are Nativemade items of unknown temporal affiliation, and they could be associated with
pre-mission, mission-period, or post-mission occupations. The Native-made lithics
are described in detail in Chapter 8, and only a few of the important observations
and interpretations are reiterated here.
The assemblage is dominated by debitage, with 603 unmodified flakes.
In addition, there are 20 cores and tested cobbles, 3 battered stone tools, and 25
chipped stone tools. The latter group contains dart points, unifacial scrapers and
miscellaneous unifaces, edge-modified flakes, bifaces, and a cobble tool. These
materials cannot be interpreted as a single coherent assemblage. It is likely that
some were deposited during the mission period, but identifying individual missionassociated artifacts—as opposed to pre- or post-mission materials—is impossible
based solely on the technological analysis.
Evidence of intensive thermal alteration and close spatial association
with Spanish colonial artifacts may provide some clues about this. For example,
no evidence of intensive heating was observed on any of the stone tools, but such
evidence was observed on 103 of the 595 unmodified flakes (17 percent). Of the
total debitage, 84 intensively heated specimens (14 percent) are concentrated in
the 99.10–98.80-m elevation range, which coincides with the level of the Spanish
surface indicated by the ash lens and burned artifacts observed in the excavations.
It is possible that the intensively heated debitage might represent mission-Indian
materials that were burned during the mission attack, but there will always be a
degree of doubt because of the likelihood that heated flakes from earlier occupations
are mixed with mission-period remains.

CHAPTER 6: ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS OF LEAD
ARTIFACTS
Steven Schooler

The Prewitt and Associates (PAI) excavations recovered 21 lead artifacts,
and the isotope study reported here indicates that 20 are Spanish colonial artifacts.
Most are amorphous lumps of lead of various weights that appear to have melted
as a result of the intense fires that destroyed the mission compound (Table 6.1).
Two (Lots 87-3 and 160-1) are thin cut strips of lead, and one is a flat sheet of lead
with a modern wire nail through it (Lot 294-1). None are clearly identifiable as
lead balls or other finished artifacts. Several of the melted specimens appear to be
mixed with earthy impurities or to have a slaggy composition, suggestive of molten
lead pooling and mixing with sediment and other particles on the ground surface.
This melted state is consistent with dozens of similar artifacts recovered in the
previous 1994–1995 and 1997 Texas Tech University (TTU) excavations from a strip
of undisturbed deposits just north of the present fence line. It is conjectured that
the area on either side of this modern fence line represents the original location of
the mission’s storehouses, which may have contained stocks of raw or finished lead
kept on hand for the domestic and defense needs. Much of this stored lead evidently
melted and splattered on the ground during the burning of the mission, a premise
that would help explain the large quantities of misshapen lead lumps recovered
from this rather restricted area.
To test this theory and to other patterns within the assemblage, a lead isotope
analysis was conducted on all 21 objects. Lead occurs naturally in the form of four
stable isotopes, 204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb, with the latter three deriving from the
radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. These radiogenic isotopes comprise the
great bulk of the world’s stock of lead, while 204Pb, known also as primeval lead,
accounts for only 1 to 2 percent of all lead found on earth. Depending on the geological
history of a given region, the relative abundance of these four isotopes imprint a
distinctive signature on lead-bearing deposits that can be useful for proveniencing
studies. Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the ratios of
the four stable lead isotopes within a given archeological sample can be determined,
allowing for the likely geologic origin of the lead to be traced (Baker et al. 2006;
Gale and Stos-Gale 2000; Russell and Farquhar 1960).
SAMPLING TECHNIQUE
Lead isotope analysis requires only very small samples, with a single
milligram of metallic lead more than sufficient. As a result, samples can be taken
with only minimal damage to artifacts. For this study, samples were extracted by

removing a tiny patch of surface corrosion with an X-acto knife (when possible) and
then drilling into freshly exposed lead. Due to the extreme precision of the ICP-MS
instrumentation involved, it is critical that cross contamination be avoided. For
this reason a fresh X-acto knife blade and 1/16-inch steel drill bit were used for
each artifact tested. Each blade and bit was cleaned of oily coatings prior to sample
extraction using a fresh cotton ball soaked in standard household isopropyl rubbing
alcohol. Additionally, each individual extraction was carried out over a fresh sheet of
regular white copy paper, with each sheet carefully discarded after use to minimize
lead residues in the work area.
All of the artifacts tested had well developed but thin surface patinas
of oxidation. Ideally, a portion of this patina should be removed prior to sample
extraction. This is due to the fact that lead in small concentrations is actually
rather ubiquitous, having been introduced into the general environment over the
last century from modern industrial processes (Rabinowitz 2005; Sangster et al.
2000). It is possible that the rind of lead oxide coating an artifact may have absorbed
some of the ambient lead from the surrounding environment, perhaps to a degree
sufficient to skew the results of a lead isotope analysis. However, several of the
objects tested in this study were very small or thin, and in many cases surface
corrosion could not be adequately removed. In these cases, samples were drilled
directly from the patinated surface, thereby necessarily incorporating some of the
oxidized outer material.

Chapter 6: Isotopic Analysis of Lead Artifacts
To my knowledge, no experiment has ever been conducted to test for the
potentially skewing effects of corrosion on lead artifacts, so it was decided in this
study to take double samples from three of the larger artifacts (87-1, 209-1, and
209-2). These were large enough to allow for the preferred method of removing a
patch of surface corrosion prior to drilling, but an additional sample was extracted
from each by simply drilling into the untreated surface. Samples obtained using both
procedures were then subjected to analysis, with the result that almost identical
isotope values were achieved. In each case, the laboratory-obtained lead isotope
values did not vary by more than 0.05 percent, indicating that at least in this case
the outer surface corrosion seems to have had very little effect. Great confidence
is thus placed in the overall accuracy of the results obtained, despite the fact that
for many of the 21 artifacts tested, the potential effects of surface corrosion could
not be mitigated.
The drilling procedure had the handy side effect of producing twin slivers
of lead, owing to the helical nature of the drill bit. One sliver was submitted for
acid dissolution and analysis via ICP-MS while the other was kept as a reference
sample. These reference samples will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), should additional testing or analysis be needed.
Additionally, as a quality control procedure, inter-run comparisons were made
during sample testing by occasionally testing samples of lead Standard Reference
Material 981, established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
SRM 981 derives from a common batch of natural homogenous lead processed on
a single occasion, for which the isotopic composition is known to a high degree of
accuracy. The established percentages and tolerances of the four lead isotopes in this
standard material are as follows (National Institute of Standards and Technology
1973): 204Pb, 1.4255±0.0012; 206Pb, 24.1442±0.0057; 207Pb, 22.0833±0.0027; and 208Pb
52.3470±0.0086. By periodically checking against these known values, laboratories
can ensure the consistency of their results within margins of error often less than
0.01 to 0.1 (Baker et al. 2006:50; Gale and Stos-Gale 2000:518). Standard errors in
this study ranged from 0.005 to 0.02 percent.
ANALYSIS METHODS
The samples were analyzed by Dr. Mike Ketterer of the Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Ketterer
provided the following description of the methodology.
Shavings of lead submitted for analysis were transferred to 50 ml
polypropylene centrifuge tubes; into each tube, 5 ml of 2.0 M aqueous HNO3 (Fisher,
Reagent Grade) were added. The tubes were tightly capped, and batches of six to
eight tubes were placed in a microwave oven. The tubes were heated by microwave
action for several cycles of 15–20 seconds to initiate dissolution; thereafter, they
were placed in an 80°C air oven overnight. Samples were diluted to 50 ml with
deionized water. The lead concentrations in each solution were determined in
250–1000x diluted aliquots of the sample solution using flame atomic absorption
spectrometry. These concentration results were used to determine appropriate

171

172

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
dilution factors for lead isotopic analysis. For the determination of Pb isotopes,
sample solutions were diluted with ~0.16 M aqueous HNO3 to contain ~100 μg/L
Pb. Thallium (50 μg/L) was added as an internal standard for mass discrimination
correction (Halliday et al. 1998; Ketterer et al. 1991). Pb isotopes were determined
by multiple collector ICP-MS using a VG Axiom MC instrument. Data were collected
in blocks of 20 ratios (approximately 4 minutes per block). The isotopes 202Hg, 203Tl,
204
Pb, 205Tl, 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb were simultaneously monitored using the Faraday
cup multiple collector array.
RESULTS
The raw isotope ratios obtained for the 21 submitted artifacts are provided
in Table 6.2. For the 3 objects from which two samples apiece were extracted, the
values for each individual test are provided, along with the average value. Overall
results are shown graphically in Figures 6.1 and 6.2 in the traditionally employed
form of a pair of bivariate plots (note that one highly anomalous item, 294-1, is not
shown in the graphs and is discussed below). The figures also incorporate several
data points culled from geological and archeometric reports on Mexican lead-bearing
deposits. The data from these outside studies present a suite of isotope values similar
to the Mission San Sabá samples, suggesting potentially matching ore sources.
Schooler (2009) tested 110 lead objects from nine eighteenth-century colonial
sites in Texas and Oklahoma, and by comparing the results to over 2,000 external
data points of known provenience determined that the lead artifacts from sites
of this period and region derived from three major geographic sources: Europe,
the Mississippi River valley, and Mexico. Mexican leads tend to express isotope
values that are generally more radiogenic than European-source leads, but far less
radiogenic than the highly anomalous leads of the Mississippi River valley. Utilizing
this same background data, the artifacts from Mission San Sabá considered here
were compared to the most closely matching Mexican sources. Known European and
Mississippi River valley sources fail to present similar lead isotope signatures, so
these sources can be confidently ruled out among this particular sample of mission
lead. Though a degree of overlap between European and Mexican leads does exist,
additional evidence provided by the objects’ archeological and historical contexts
argues strongly for the case that these samples are indeed composed of lead derived
from Mexico.
In Figures 6.1 and 6.2, the average values are used to plot single data points
for the three doubly sampled artifacts. The clustering of all 20 points is sufficiently
dense within these graphs that some overlap occurs among them. As a result, not all
points are simultaneously visible. Figures 6.1 and 6.2 show a tightly confined range
of lead isotope values, well within the known sphere of Mexican values, indicating
the likelihood that they originated from common sources.
The data from these 20 samples fall into two distinct groups. Using the
Pb/ Pb ratio as the primary indicator, 16 of the artifacts have a very tight range
of values from 18.695 to 18.739 (termed here Cluster 1), while 4 others express
slightly more radiogenic values of 18.936 to 18.943 (Cluster 2). Correspondingly

narrow ranges are reported for the other isotope ratios (see Table 6.2). The tight
graphical groupings of Clusters 1 and 2 indicate a general uniformity of composition
for their respective members.
Cluster 1
In a separate study of 60 lead artifacts from Mission San Sabá, all recovered
from the 1994 and 1997 TTU excavations conducted in the main portion of the site,
9 artifacts revealed isotope signatures very similar to Cluster 1. In common with
the 16 Cluster 1 objects considered here, all but 1 of those 9 objects were melted
and misshapen pieces recovered from the southern portion of the site. Several
dozen such objects were recovered from this area just north of the fence line during
the previous excavations (Schooler 2009). Clearly, most of the melted lead items
recovered from the PAI excavations share a similar origin and composition. In all

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
likelihood, supplies of surplus Mexican lead brought to the mission were kept in
the storehouses that once stood here, with much of the lead melting during the fire
that destroyed the outbuildings.
The one item of similar isotopic composition that was neither melted nor
recovered near the modern fence line is a deformed lead ball found in 1997 within
a feature interpreted as a trash pit. Located northwest of the footprint of the
mission chapel, this feature (Feature 26) produced large quantities of burned animal
bones and scorched earth. It likely represents refuse generated by the day-to-day
activities of the mission inhabitants prior to its destruction (Grant Hall, personal
communication 2006). If that is the case, this scorched lead ball, similar in isotopic
composition to the Cluster 1 objects, could have been used to kill a deer or other game
animal as food for the mission inhabitants. This particular bullet presumably would
have been molded from the same stock of lead that was stored in the storehouses
and later melted and pooled during the mission burning episode.
Four of the artifacts from Cluster 1 (209-4, 209-7, 209-9, and 224-1), while
having the appearance and heft of lead, are so hard that they could not be drilled
even at high speed with pressure applied; on these items the drill bit just spun or
skittered across the surface. They appear to be some type of slaggy residue that
nevertheless has a significant lead content; crumbly fragments or small chunks
were cut from these four objects for sampling.
Overall, the objects comprising Cluster 1 conform well to a series of points
in Cumming et al. (1979), corresponding to lead sources found in the highland
plateau of Mexico, including samples from Pachuca, Taxco, and Angangueo (see
Figure 6.1). A small region to the north including Charcas in San Luis Potosí is
also potentially indicated, as is Ojuela in eastern Chihuahua and points in Sinaloa
including Copala and Tigre. The data points of this cluster also match well with
some points for Chihuahua and the Sierra Madre Occidental provided by Housh
and McDowell (2005) and McDowell et al. (1999).
Such a finding is entirely consistent with eighteenth-century silver mining
activities in colonial Mexico, in which lead was often encountered as a useful and
abundant byproduct of the energetic silver enterprises underway at that time.
Geologically, lead is often found intermingled with silver deposits, and Spanish
silver mining was especially active in northern Chihuahua during the mid-1700s
(Couturier 2003; Hadley 1975). It is reasonable, then, to think that a Spanish mission
founded through the patronizing graces of the Spanish silver baron, Don Pedro
Romero de Terreros, might have been stocked with lead taken from this booming area.
Cluster 1 also conforms well with the series of data points provided by Joel
et al. (1988). Using sherds found in excavations of the Metropolitan Cathedral in
Mexico City, which date before 1573, that study demonstrated the use of Mexicanorigin lead in majolica glazes even by that early date. While not a direct geologic
source, the isotopic affinity of these majolica sherds provides some secondary,
circumstantial evidence to reinforce a distinctly Mexican origin for the melted lead
objects recovered from Mission San Sabá.

Chapter 6: Isotopic Analysis of Lead Artifacts
Cluster 2
Graphically, the four objects in Cluster 2 form an extremely tight grouping,
although in an area somewhat poorly populated by data points of known Mexican
geologic origin. However, raw isotope data for Mexican lead sources is relatively
scant, and the values represented by Cluster 2 do fall along the general trendline for
Mexican leads if extended to include increasingly radiogenic sources. A few scattered
points supplied by Housh and McDowell (2005) and graphs provided by MirandaGasca et al. (1993) suggest a connection with sources from eastern Chihuahua and
the Sierra Madre Occidental, as well as the Fresnillo district of the Guerrero terrane
of Mexico. Such locations would be consistent with the eighteenth-century silver
mining underway within these regions. The Cluster 2 items definitively represent
Mexican lead, as no European or Mississippi River valley sources match this range
of values (Schooler 2009).
Three of the four samples in Cluster 2 originated from Level 4 of Unit AE10
(87-1, 87-2, and 87-3). The fourth sample, 160-1, was recovered from Level 3 of Unit
AW6. Samples 87-3 and 160-1 are both very small and thin but clearly cut scraps
of flattened lead; they do not appear to have been subjected to melting. Sample
87-1, by its appearance and weight of 10.7 g, is potentially a deformed lead ball. It
is similar to many other deformed lead balls recovered from Mission San Sabá in
the 1994–1995 and 1997 excavations, although it is sufficiently misshapen so as to
make such an identification uncertain. Sample 87-2 is an amorphous lump more
suggestive of melting, akin to the objects forming Cluster 1.
The four objects in Cluster 2 bear isotopic signatures very similar to 6 of the
60 other objects from Mission San Sabá tested as part of a separate study (Schooler
2009). Of those 6 items, one is a fully round lead ball, and 5 have the weight and
appearance of lead balls but are deformed by heating. While the provenience of 2 of
these 6 items is not known, 2 were found within the footprint of the mission chapel,
and the other 2 were adjacent to the chapel’s southern edge. Their distributions do
not form a pattern as easily explained as that observed for the Cluster 1 objects.
Regardless, the Cluster 2 artifacts likely represent items made or used by the
Spanish.
The Cluster 2 items are clearly made of Mexican-origin lead but perhaps
represent a slightly different stock of metal from Cluster 1. Mexican leads are fairly
heterogeneous in their composition (Cumming et al. 1979), and the receipt of a
shipment from slightly different origins could easily account for such a discrepancy.
Also, this example of disparity is not a unique instance among the Mexican-origin
leads found at Mission San Sabá. Schooler (2009) identifies two other separate
groupings of distinctively Mexican-origin lead at the mission that are not represented
within the current sample.
An Anomalous Item
The remaining object, 294-1, does not belong to either Cluster 1 or 2.
Rather, it has such a deviant lead isotope signature that it does not match any of
the Mexican, European, or Mississippi River valley sources consulted in the course

177

178

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
of this study. This artifact is a flat triangular lead piece that has a 4 1/16-inch
machine-manufactured (wire) iron nail driven through it. Initially, it was thought
that a piece of Spanish lead had been used by a local farmer or rancher to make an
impromptu washer, like the lead washers on tin roofing nails. However, the extremely
anomalous lead isotope signature of this piece suggests that this a fully modern
object. It is likely that this lead represents a mix of mined and recycled lead from
many different sources, which explains its unique chemical signature.
CONCLUSIONS
The isotopic evidence indicates that 20 of the tested artifacts are of lead
from Mexico, and 1 is a modern item made of lead from a non-Mexican source. The
historical record has details that corroborate the notion that Mexican-origin lead was
transported to and kept at the site, despite the fact that lead is not among the items
listed in the original inventory of supplies purchased for the mission. Combing the
inventory translation prepared by Philip A. Dennis (1995a) as originally published
in Hindes et al. (1995:69–78) (see Appendix B), there are no direct mentions of any
lead objects. The only indication of an article that may refer to ammunition comes
in an entry for “8 bunches of granizo,” which Dennis notes literally means “hail”
(Hindes et al. 1995:72). The form or function of this mysterious granizo remains
unknown. However, it is evident from accounts of the attack that the survivors did
have ample ammunition with which they attempted to defend themselves (Hadley
et al. 1997:511–520; Nathan and Simpson 1959). One possibility is that the lead
used there was originally transported along with all the other military equipment
directly to Presidio San Sabá and thus would not have appeared in the mission
inventory. It is certain that the military equipment and weapons for the presidio
soldiers were not included in the mission inventory (see Chapter 2 and Appendix
A), including two small cannons that were at the mission on the day of the attack
(Nathan and Simpson 1959:44, 51, 75, 92). In addition, a few days before the attack,
Colonel Parrilla sent “a quantity of lead for bullets and a supply of powder, in addition
to what was already at the mission” (Nathan and Simpson 1959:51).
Further evidence for the presence of Mexican lead on the site is found in a
1901 letter and map penned by J. J. Callan. On the map (see Figure 3.1), Callan (1901)
indicates a spot near the now-known location of Mission San Sabá that he labeled
“Presidio. Smelter.” The marked location is incorrect in referring to the presidio,
and Callan may have mistakenly interpreted the remains of the burned mission as
a smelter (McWilliams and Boyd 2008:44; see Chapter 3). In a corresponding letter
about the mission environs, Callan (1901) commented that:
Hundreds of prospectors…have been here from time to time within
the past fifty years… [looking for] the lost mine and hidden treasure.
But none ever succeeded in finding anything to indicate the presence
of either, excepting the remains of the smelter, some crucibles, a few
small slabs of lead containing a considerable per centum of silver,
some tools and impliments and parts of human bones. (Callan 1901;
see Appendix A and McWilliams and Boyd [2008:75])

Chapter 6: Isotopic Analysis of Lead Artifacts
This passage indicates that, near the turn of the twentieth century, lead
slabs were still present at the site. The critical point here is that the lead contained
a considerable percentage of silver, which implies that someone assayed some of
these lead bars in the late nineteenth century, probably as part of their quest for the
Menard area’s legendary silver mines. This is precisely what might be expected of
Mexican lead produced as a byproduct of the Mexican silver mining industry. Such
an assay could have contributed to misperceptions about the nature of the mission
site. A finding of silver mixed with the lead may have well caused early treasure
seekers to think of the location as the remains of a Spanish smelter.
In addition to the evidence provided by the isotopic data and Callan’s
comment, a letter written by the director of the San Antonio missions only five days
after the destruction of Mission San Sabá shows that the Spanish missionaries
were accustomed to getting their lead directly from Mexico. Thinking even Presidio
San Sabá to be destroyed, and uncertain of the degree of danger faced by the San
Antonio missions, Father Mariano de los Dolores wrote to the priests of the Rio
Grande missions, imploring them to send him lead for use as ammunition: “I will
appreciate if, with all diligence, Your Reverences request a carga [12 arrobas] of lead
and as much gunpowder as you can, and send them without delay by Indians of those
missions [the Rio Grande missions], as these missions are short of ammunition”
(Wade 2007:201). Wade says that 12 arrobas was equivalent to 300 kg, although other
sources (Nathan and Simpson 1959:141; Kyle 2000:59) indicate a lesser equivalency
of 138 kg. Either way, Father Dolores was requesting that a substantial amount of
lead be sent by way of Mexico for the defense of the San Antonio missions. Transport
of Mexican-mined lead to Spanish colonial frontier outposts probably was as routine
as the shipment of other standard commodities (Hadley 1975; Ringrose 1970).

CHAPTER 7: ANALYSIS OF FIRED DAUB
Mark R. Wolf

Historical and archeological evidence indicates that the Mission San Sabá
complex was made up of wattle-and-daub jacales and possibly open-air ramadas.
An jacal is a simple structure with walls composed of vertical wood posts and sticks
covered with mud; roof forms vary. In contrast, a ramada is a shade arbor with a
roof (usually of branches and thatch), resting on upright posts. Ramadas may be
stand-alone structures, or they may be attached to other buildings. Similarly, a jacal
may be a single-room structure, or a series of contiguous jacales may form a large
room block. When the mission was destroyed by fire in 1758, the clay plastering on
the walls of the jacal structures was fired, and much of it was heated enough that
it was preserved as fired daub. Fired daub was the most common building material
found in the PAI excavations.
This chapter presents an analysis of the fired daub, providing descriptions
based on visual inspection. This analysis complements a detailed analyses being
conducted by the author on the larger collection of fired daub recovered from the
main portion of the mission site during the 1993–1994 and 1997 excavations by
Texas Tech University (TTU). In addition, the horizontal distribution of burned
daub in the PAI excavations was compared with the burned daub distributions
in the TTU excavations, and this comparison proved essential to interpreting the
materials recovered from the FM 2092 right of way.
Thousands of pieces (247 bags) of fired daub weighing 22.44 kg were
recovered.51 Daub was found in most of the units, with some yielding significant
quantities. It was found in almost every excavation level, from the surface to 60 cm
below the surface. The highest concentrations of daub were in the excavation units
14–21 m west of the historical monument, suggesting that structures once stood in
this area. This corresponds with the more-substantial daub concentrations found
in the TTU excavations just across the property fence from these units.
The daub fragments range in maximum size from 0.7 to over 6.2 cm, with
most being 1.5–2.5 cm. The small size of the pieces initially was surprising, since the
FM 2092 portion of the site was thought to be less disturbed than the main portion
in an agricultural field that has been in cultivation since ca. 1899. The assumption
was that more-complete and larger fragments would be found in the road right of
way. In retrospect, this assumption was unfounded, because the old fence line was
moved when the county road was expanded, and what is now the northern edge
A small percentage of these pieces may be fired earth rather than daub. Fired earth would be
natural sediment that was intensively heated during burning of the mission.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
of the FM 2092 right of way was once under cultivation. Although fired daub was
indeed found in situ, the collection has few large pieces with sufficient diagnostic
features to shed new light on the type of jacales built at the mission. However,
enough information has been recorded from the smaller pieces to support additional
interpretations about the extent of the mission compound.
SPANISH DAUB CONSTRUCTION
Daub was a quick and economical building material, similar to contemporary
stucco/plaster, that was applied onto a framework of wooden posts with various
fashions of branch lathing. Made from the earth at hand, and often mixed with
grass as a binder, daub provided a sturdy, solid, smooth-faced, and water- and
rodent-resistant wall surface suitable for a variety of small building types. With
occasional maintenance, requiring a reapplication of the mud-like material, daub
construction could last for many decades in dry climates. Similar in general finish
to plastered adobe walls, daub walls also could be coated with a slip similar to
pottery, producing a fine surface that could be painted or whitewashed for further
decoration or weather protection.
Daub is associated with jacal and palisado (a palisade wall of vertical posts)
structures of Spanish colonial vintage (Fox and Tomka 2006:33; George 1975:28–30,
Hindes et al. 1995:55–64). The large seventeenth-century Spanish community of San
Luis in western Florida has some of the best examples of this type of architecture.
It included a mission, presidio, and house structures constructed of wattle and daub
with whitewash finishes. A 1788 map of St. Augustine lists two structures made
of cujes y harro (wattle and daub) in which a wooden framework with a secondary
woven mesh of horizontal branches was covered with daub. Similar structures
found in the West Indies indicate that this construction type is strong and durable
(Manucy 1978:71–73). The palisade wall surrounding Mission San Sabá was built
of vertical wooden upright posts, but it is uncertain if the mission’s jacal structures
also had palisade walls with closely spaced posts. In fact, the frequency and spacing
of postmolds suggest that it is more likely the jacales were built with a mesh or lath
secondary structure similar to those found in Florida52.
HOW THE MISSION BUILDINGS BURNED
Because of its composition, daub has limited tensile strength; therefore a
wattle-and-daub structure relies on the resilient wooden framework to absorb lateral
forces and thus perform effectively as a building wall system. It can be assumed that
two forces came into play during the collapse of the daub-plastered jacal structures
at Mission San Sabá: gravity pressure and intensive heating, which caused thermal
combustion of the wood and organic matter.
As described in primary Spanish documents detailing the mission destruction,
the attacking Norteños repeatedly placed burning brush against the stockade and
buildings to intensify the fires (Nathan and Simpson 2000:49, 71, 81, 88, 90). Days
Grant Hall (personal communication 2013) notes that the TTU investigations uncovered some
remnant wall trenches from probable jacales, but he believes most wall trenches and other shallow
features were destroyed by decades of plowing.
52

Chapter 7: Analysis of Fired Daub
later, Colonel Parrilla noted in his tour of the destroyed mission that remnants of
the structures were still smoldering (Nathan and Simpson 2000:56). The recovered
daub supports these statements, since most of the collection displays a wide range of
heat-induced damage. The result of the intensive heating is that most of the daub,
with its high sand/clay content, was fired to a pottery-like hardness. Some pieces,
in contrast, were not subjected to intense or prolonged firing; they are recognized
by their soft rounded exterior surfaces and the lower density of their composition.
The daub from the mission is highly variable, reflecting the wide range of heating
conditions that affected the structures.
As the buildings burned, the wooden superstructures and intermediate wall
lathing suffered structural fatigue. The daub most likely assisted in holding the
structures together for some time, primarily as a heat-insulating fire retardant and
secondarily as a structural support. However, at some point, the fire accomplished
its task. Once the wooden members burned enough to lose their strength, gravity
took over, and the burning wooden framework began to collapse. The collapse,
in turn, caused lateral structural forces to be imposed on the daub material.
The resultant weight loading and movement were more than the material could
withstand. As the buildings began to collapse, the fired daub became brittle and
fractured into small pieces, falling to the ground. The remaining wooden frame
(and the wattle) was then exposed and vulnerable to the flames. In many cases,
the organic binder within the daub pieces continued to burn for some time after
the daub fell and scattered.
An experimental controlled burn of a similarly constructed twentieth-century
Serbian wattle-and-daub cottage recorded that the thatch-roof structure burned in
less than 20 minutes (Nathan and Simpson 2000:95–96). Roof members burned,
smoldered, and reignited for over 6 hours, and the wattle-and-daub walls burned
intermittently for over 30 hours. Few of the posts burned to the ground.
This experiment led to an important observation: that the fire resulted in
“a very localized baking of the wall clay, and the destruction of one post here and
another there” (Bankoff and Winter 1979; also see Noël Hume 1982:250). While the
details of such a controlled experimental burn cannot be analogous to the Mission
San Sabá fires, the general aspects of the burn—such as the relative ease with
which the roof burned and the durability of the fire-retardant properties of the
daub wall—are relevant.
THE FIRED DAUB FROM MISSION SAN SABÁ
Two terms were used to classify the fired materials in this analysis: fired
daub and puddled adobe (which includes fired earth). Both of these materials are
preserved because they were subjected to heating, but they exhibit slightly different
characteristics. The distinctions between them are not related to the intensity of
firing but to subtle differences in composition and attributes that reflect how wet
mud was applied to form the walls and floors of structures.
Items referred to in this report as fired daub have a matrix composition of
fine sand, clay, occasional small pebbles, and various amounts of organic binder that

183

184

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
generally appear as voids in the matrix. The texture is lightly abrasive, similar to a
fine sandstone. Items referred to as puddled adobe have a very dense, tight matrix
that is finer-grained clay throughout, and it contains fewer organic inclusion voids
and pebbles.
The fired daub, especially specimens with a high clay content, readily
exhibits many features revealing the solid structures onto which the wet daub was
impressed. Once this wet daub was fired, it solidified and made a permanent record
of the imprints of burned or decayed bark, wood grain, branches, twigs, reeds, leaves,
and grasses. While these kinds of impressions are common in the assemblage, it is
difficult to discern meaningful patterns because the daub pieces are so small and
most of the impressions are haphazard and seemingly asymmetrical.
As the term is used in this chapter, puddled adobe refers to the construction
material and application technique that was used to build walls, floors, and
ceilings, which is consistent with how Tunnell (1969:11) used the term at Mission
San Lorenzo. The main distinction between puddled adobe and fired daub is a
compositional difference that reflects how the wet mud was applied. Puddled adobe
is essentially the outer layers of plaster that were applied to a wattle-and-daub
wall (both interior or exterior wall surfaces) or the uppermost layers of plaster
applied to a floor surface. The layering effect was created by repeated smoothing
of the wet mud surface. At Mission San Sabá, the puddled adobe specimens were
found as thin pieces that are longer than they are wide, and they are generally
light gray in color. The puddled adobe has random, rough edges rather than
smooth edges representing impression surfaces. The puddled adobe from Mission
San Sabá may be pieces of wall plaster (outer edges of wall daub), floor plaster,
or melted and reconsolidated wall daub. The term fired earth is used for heated
pieces of clayey material that share many of the same attributes as puddled adobe
fragments but may just be natural sediment that heated (e.g., natural sediment
at the base of a jacal wall).
General Observations
Listed below are characteristics evident in most of the fired daub and puddled
adobe collected.
•

Most have been subjected to enough heat to effectively fire the daub
matrix. It is obvious that heat-induced chemical reactions have altered
and hardened the material.

•

Some do not appear to be significantly altered by heating. These pieces
are softer than the intensively fired daub, often to the point that some
almost crumble on contact. The pieces often exhibit sooty burning
characteristics, presumably due to oxygen-reduced heating conditions.

•

The daub is noticably lighter in weight than an aquivalent volume of
rock or clay. This may be due, at least in part, to the pore spaces where
organic materials (i.e., binding agent) were burned out of the interior.

Chapter 7: Analysis of Fired Daub
•

The daub is lightly abrasive to the touch, with a texture similar to that
of fine-grained sandstone.

•

There appear to be two main composition types. One is a soft sand/clay
matrix. The other is a dense high-clay matrix. Despite these differences,
the color characteristics are fairly uniform.

•

Most exhibit many small tubular interior impressions of organic
or vegetal material that was used as a binding agent. These voids
represent impressions of material, probably fine grass, that was mixed
with clayey material to create a daub with specific properties (e.g.,
durability and plasticity).

•

Very small pebbles were occasionally found in the daub matrix; the
current sample is too small to establish any patterns that would help
understand these inclusions.

•

All daub pieces are irregular in shape, and none are exactly alike
in appearance. However, all share similar features of pockmarks,
indentations, very small air holes, and nodular surface projections.

•

It is apparent that the daub was applied in a wet, pasty, highly
malleable form. The concentrations of clay within the matrix, when
thoroughly saturated, allowed the matrix to securely adhere to the
wooden structural framework or lathing (i.e., the wattle).

•

The organic impressions, when clustered on the surfaces of a piece of
daub, usually occur on less than 50 percent of the total surface area,
indicating that the failure could have occurred at the point where the
daub came in direct contact with the burning structural wood.

•

A small amount of the materials exhibit a very dense, clay-rich
consistency that is different from the fired daub. Gray in color, these
pieces are thought to represent puddled adobe representing wall pieces
or floor plastering, similar to that found at Mission San Lorenzo. The
small quantity relative to daub is similar to that recovered in the TTU
excavations.
Color Characteristics

The daub specimens have multiple distinct color ranges, mainly relating
to the different matrix compositions mentioned above. The more highly fired and
denser pieces have a higher clay content (some of which may be associated with fired
earth) and are light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) to light gray (10YR 7/2). The morecommon specimens are moderately burned with a high sand and organic content,
and they range from pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) to reddish gray (5YR 5/2). Some of the
daub exhibits a sooty, burned character, with splotches of reddish brown (5YR 4/3
to 5/3) to dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4). The most intensively burned daub is less
common; it is almost charred and is very dark gray (5YR 3/1).

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Soot and Burn Characteristics
Most of the daub fragments exhibit some sooty carbon residue on at least a
portion of their surfaces or a charred discoloration separate from the true color of
the daub. These conditions could have occurred independently, but together they
suggest the daub was exposed for some time to thick smoke or a smoky fire. The
discoloration, although giving the impression of being surface damage as a result
of the fires, also affects the interior of some pieces. This could be due to smoke
permeating the matrix or perhaps to burning in an oxygen-reduced environment.
It also could be the result of the slow, smoldering burn of organic material inside
the daub, perhaps through combustion of grass or straw that was added to the clay
as a binding agent..
Many of the sooty pieces have tiny tubular cavities that once contained small
reeds or grasses. As this material slowly burned in an oxygen-reduced, smoke-filled
environment, the color of the surrounding daub was affected. This is very similar
to the carbon deposits that result from the low-temperature, oxygen-reduction
firing techniques used by contemporary Santa Clara Indian potters of New Mexico
(LeFree 1975:63).
This is clearest in the daub from Units AW2, AW7, AW20, and BW20 (Lots
6, 17, 135, and 164). Two daub pieces from AW2 were actually one piece that broke
along a fault line evidently caused by the interior burning of organic material,
possibly a small reed. When the pieces are rejoined, the dark residue is completely
hidden within the reconstructed piece, indicating that the burning of interior
organics and discoloration was localized. In contrast, some other sooty daub pieces
with exterior discoloration were probably heated in a more-generalized oxygenreduced environment.
ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES
No substantive stone or adobe features have been discovered at Mission San
Sabá to date, but impressions observed in the daub offer some insights into jacal
architecture and construction techniques. Jacal construction is similar in structure
to that of the palisado. Eugene George (1975:28) describes the wall construction
of jacales in the Falcon Reservoir basin of south Texas as “consisting of a fence of
closely spaced vertical palisades or pickets placed into a continuous trench in the
ground defining a single room. The fence would serve as a base on which a surface
of adobe plaster would be spread on the inner, as well as the outer, surfaces. The
result was a tight, substantial wall.”
Because of the simplicity of the construction techniques and materials, it can
be assumed the Mission San Sabá structures were built quickly. The daub would
have been moist enough to be in a plastic form when it was applied, yet dry enough
to adhere to the wooden framework and remain in place. The daub was cured simply
by air drying, and any walls that received direct exposure to the sun were also baked.
Most of the recovered daub appears to be fragments of walls, and some
pieces display attributes indicative of specific architectural elements or techniques.

Chapter 7: Analysis of Fired Daub
The analysis of the mission daub included a careful examination of each piece
looking for impressions and attributes that would provide localized hints of the
wall construction materials and methods. The patterns of attributes observed for
the entire assemblage were then reviewed for a broader look at how some of the
Mission San Sabá buildings were constructed.
Exterior Surfaces
The exterior surfaces of some daub samples reveal there were attempts to
smooth and finish final surfaces (Figure 7.1). These specimens have indications of
rubbing or brushing the surface, perhaps after the daub had been applied but not
before it had completely dried. These pieces also show a thin layer of fine-grained
sediment at the exterior that is denser than the remaining matrix. This indicates
that the rubbing or troweling of the wall floated the finer materials to the surface,
not unlike the process of burnishing or polishing ceramic vessels before firing.
Primary and Secondary Structural Elements
The assemblage has some consistent diameters of the tubular impressions
that were adjacent to the wooden framework (Figure 7.2). These diameters suggest
that a wooden frame formed the primary structural support and that the intervening
areas were filled with an interwoven lattice of smaller branches. Early-twentiethcentury photographs provide an important record of Spanish-style jacal construction
techniques (Figures 7.3 and 7.4) for comparison with the archeological daub.
In addition to the major structural elements, some excavation units yielded
daub pieces that display parallel impressions suggesting a tightly spaced secondary
framework (Figure 7.5). Some of the specimens also display parallel impressions that
were perpendicular to other impressions. Most of those with parallel impressions
are from Units AE14, AW8, AW14, AW 14.5, and AW16, and AW25 (Lots 28, 34, 119,
197, 210, and 252). The average diameter of these impressions ranges from 1.1 to
1.3 cm (ca. 0.4 to 0.5 inches). The spacing, size, and apparent depth of these tubular
impressions suggest that the daub was plastered onto a solid mat of interlaced
vertical and horizontal sticks. If this is the case, the jacales may have looked very
similar to the the one shown in Figure 7.3. They would also resemble the structures
depicted in the 1760s painting portraying the destruction of the mission (see Chapter
13).
George (1975:30) observed that the lathing used in jacal wall construction
was made of organic materials: “The palisades could be separated slightly to permit
a screening partition of horizontal wood members composed of interwoven twigs,
branches, split wood, or even bundles of grass.” This technique is also evident in
early-twentieth-century photographs of occupied jacal buildings (see Figures 7.3 and
7.4). This is confirmed in the daub from the PAI investigation. Impressions made
by twigs, leaves, grasses, and reeds are on the surfaces of most of the fragments,
both large and small, although they are not as readily apparent on those in which
the matrix is grainy with a higher amount of sand.

Puddled Adobe and Fired Earth
Fragments that are denser and grayer with a thin, horizontal shape,
representing less than 2 percent of the assemblage, are interpreted as puddled adobe
and fired earth. Curtis Tunnell (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969:11) reports on puddled
adobe found at Mission San Lorenzo, near Camp Wood, Texas, which approximates
the description of this material. At San Lorenzo, the puddled adobe is associated
with intentional floor plaster, the ceiling mud layer and plaster, and the mortar used
between adobe bricks. In the case of Mission San Sabá, the puddled adobe may be
wall plaster fragments or daub that melted off the jacal walls and collected in a
mass at the base of the wall.
The horizontal aspect of the fragments from Mission San Sabá suggests a
layered formation of a material that did not bond to any adjacent surfaces (Figure
7.6). Most of the surfaces of these fragments are coarser and more irregular on one
face, with the opposite face being smoother.
A small number of specimens exhibit attributes that suggest they are simply
fired earth, created when the natural clayey sediments adjacent to a structure
were subjected to intensive heat. This could have occurred at the ground level close
to vertical wall posts or adjacent to a stockade wall where large posts burned in

COMPARISONS WITH DAUB FROM
TTU INVESTIGATIONS
The previous investigations at Mission San Sabá by TTU produced a large
collection of fired daub. A survey in September 1993 documented the extent and
density of the daub scatter as it was exposed in the recently plowed alfalfa field
(Hindes et al. 1995:55–63). This first event, more accurately described as a surface
collection, was conducted on the day that the mission site was initially rediscovered.
During TTU’s 1993–1994 investigations, fired daub was found in limited amounts
in almost every hand-dug unit and machine-excavated trench (Hindes et al.
1995:Table 6). During TTU’s 1997 investigations, fired daub was found in almost
every excavated unit.
In the 1997 season, the recovery of daub was intentionally limited. The
decision was made to only retrieve fired daub found in situ that was larger than

2 cm. None of the daub found within the plow zone was collected (other than a few
surface collection samples). Because the PAI collection policy was to recover all the
burned daub regardless of size and whether it was in situ or in the screen, a direct
comparison with the TTU daub is not possible. While the densities of fired daub are
not completely compatible, some comparisons can be made.
In general, the PAI daub collection appears to have been exposed to more
intensive firing compared to the TTU daub excavated immediately to the north.
There are fewer soft, rounded, sooty organic pieces in the PAI collection, suggesting
more intense or prolonged burning. This greater degree of heating could indicate
that this is where the Norteños piled brush near the stockade and structures to
start the fires (Nathan and Simpson 2000:88). It also is possible that the PAI daub

193

194

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
is from jacal structures that were close to the burning stockade walls where the
hottest fires would have been.
The units extending from AW13 to AW21 have considerably more daub by
weight than other units along row A, and Units BW15 and BW16 have more than
other units along row B (Figure 7.7). When the excavations are plotted in relation
to the nine TTU units immediately across the fence, this concentration of daub
corresponds well with the TTU findings, although daub densities are higher in the
latter (see Figure 7.7). Thus, it is reasonable to assume the jacal structures at the
mission extended into the FM 2092 right of way.
Another similarity exists between the PAI and TTU excavations with
respect to the excavation levels with the greatest densities of daub. Overall, the
greatest amounts were found at elevations of 99.00–98.90 m, although some units
had more at 98.90–98.80 m. In most units, the daub weights were also high in the
levels immediately above and below this, after which the weights fell off markedly
(see distribution data in Chapter 12). Thus, it appears the structures burned,
collapsed, and were allowed to slowly crumble into the natural grade with minimal
postdepositional disturbance.
CONCLUSIONS
The homogeneity in the daub found in the PAI and TTU excavations is
consistent with the idea that it all reflects construction over a short span of time,
probably a few months, by the same people using the same local clay source and
plant fibers as binders. The distributional evidence supports the conclusion that the
structures hypothesized by TTU along the south edge of the alfalfa field do extend
southward into the FM 2092 right of way and that these were a series of jacal-like
buildings aligned east-west near the south wall of the mission stockade. The daub
density by level corresponds to the TTU excavations as well. This indicates that the
daub and artifact concentrations at this level represent the original ground surface
at the time of the 1758 attack.
The frequency of daub with large branch, possible split branch, and smaller
branch/reed impressions supports the general interpretation of jacal-like structures,
but too little is known to make definitive statements on the actual jacal style(s) and
construction techniques used (although the presence of widely spaced postmolds
and the lack of wall trenches provide some hints). The evidence indicates that these
buildings had a large structural framework with supplemental secondary lath or
lattice interwoven, onto which the wet daub was applied.
The smaller pieces of daub in the PAI collection, with their apparent higher
firing temperature, may be the result of more intensive firing than in other areas
of the site. The limited quantities of blackened softer daub and fired earth also
suggests that higher firing temperatures prevailed in this area of the mission
compound.

FUTURE RESEARCH
The analysis presented here was limited by available time and funding.
The author’s ongoing analyses of the postmolds observed and daub recovered in the
1997 TTU investigations may provide more complementary data. Further, attention
could be given to better defining the common organic impressions in the daub and
the diameters of the various types of plant impressions, and botanical experts
may be able to identify the various types of plants used in the construction. Thin
sections of selected daub specimens followed by petrographic analysis might also be
informative regarding different daub matrix compositions. This, in turn, might lead
to a better understanding of possible functional distinctions in the use of different
types of daub. Finally, a plant microfossil study could be undertaken to try to extract
and identify pollen, phytoliths, and starch grains that may be trapped inside the
daub; such remains could provide evidence regarding the plant life and riverine
environment around the mission in 1757–1758. Plant evidence, both macrofossil
impressions and microfossils, could also provide some limited evidence of the season
when the structures were built.

CHAPTER 8: ANALYSIS OF NATIVE-MADE
LITHIC ARTIFACTS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN
John E. Dockall

INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes an analysis of 651 Native-made lithic artifacts from
the Mission San Sabá excavations (excluding 9 obviously mission-associated ones
described in Chapter 5). The lithics consist of 648 chipped stone specimens and 3
battered stones, all presumed to have been made and used by Native Americans.
These artifacts cannot be attributed to any specific occupation group or time period
with any degree of confidence. The assemblage consists of tools and debitage that
might have been created and used by Late Prehistoric or Protohistoric groups prior
to the mission occupation, the mission Indians during the brief occupation in 1757–
1758, some of the Native groups (i.e., the Norteños) that attacked and destroyed the
mission in 1758, or historic Native groups that visited the site sometime after the
mission was destroyed.53 One important thing to remember, though, is that, unlike
at many other missions, the Native presence at Mission San Sabá during its brief 11
months was minimal. Few Indians lived there, and only small bands—most reported
to have been Apache—ever stopped there, staying for only short periods of time.
Mission San Sabá is in a location that was used by people long before and
after the mission period. Native Americans lived by and used the San Saba River and
the nearby spring prior to the mission occupation, and some Native groups remained
in the area for many years after the mission was destroyed. Consequently, the
difficulties in distinguishing between pre-mission, mission-period, and post-mission
lithics in this analysis were anticipated. An attempt to sort out mission-period lithic
artifacts was made by comparing the assemblage with those from other Spanish
missions in Texas and by conducting an in-depth study of a subset of the artifacts
found in the units and levels that yielded most of the Spanish colonial artifacts, but
this was unsuccessful. Table 8.1 summarizes the artifacts described here.
METHODOLOGY
The assemblage from Mission San Sabá was compared to previous analyses
of lithic materials from other Spanish missions in Texas, including those by Daniel
Fox (1979), Hester (1977), Inman (1999), Lohse (1999), Ricklis (1999), and Tomka
(1999a, 1999b). Important Spanish colonial mission sites that have yielded lithic
assemblages associated with mission Indians include Mission San José y San Miguel
de Aguayo (41BX3; Tomka and Fox 1998, 1999; Tomka et al. 1999); Mission Espíritu
It is possible that Spaniards could have made or used some of the stone artifacts, but Native
American origin and use is more likely.

de la Espada (41BX4; Tennis 2001).
Raw Material
Raw material type was recorded
for all stone artifacts. Previous analyses
of mission assemblages indicate a nearly
exclusive use of raw materials of local or
nearby origin, with the exception of some
European-produced gunflints or strike-alight components.

Mission San Sabá is in an area of the
San Saba River floodplain that contains cherts, quartzites, and occasional petrified
wood that would have been easily accessible to Native American inhabitants.
Remnants of a Quaternary terrace deposit that would have equivalent materials
is just south of the site. The walls of the San Saba River valley and adjacent feeder
creeks expose Cretaceous-age deposits of Fort Terrett limestone and dolomite and
Hensell sand (Barnes 1981). Lithic resources of the Fort Terrett formation include
porcelaneous aphanitic limestone and some chert. North and south of the Fort Terrett
formation, the Segovia Formation and combined Fort Terrett/Segovia beds contain
limestone, dolomite, and thin-bedded cherty breccias. East, into parts of McCulloch,
Mason, and Llano Counties, is the massive complex of Cambrian and Pre-Cambrian
igneous and metamorphic rock associated with the Llano Uplift, which could have
provided materials for manufacturing a variety of ground stone tools.
Artifact Classification and Attributes
The artifacts were first sorted into major groups of chipped stone tools,
debitage, cores and tested cobbles, and battered stone tools. Artifacts were examined
under a low-powered microscope to search for use wear traces and evidence of
technology and morphology. A specific set of attributes was then recorded for each
specimen.
Projectile Points
Projectile points were subdivided into arrow points and dart points. Formal
type names following Turner and Hester (1999) were used when possible. Projectile
point attributes were coded to define completeness, fragment type, breakage type/
cause, breakage location, raw material, and presence or absence of thermal alteration.
Maximum length, blade length, blade width, blade thickness, haft length, haft
thickness, neck width, and neck thickness were recorded (in millimeters); weight was

Chapter 8: Analysis of Native-Made Lithic Artifacts of Unknown Origin
recorded as well (in grams). The 13 potential fragment types are: proximal, medial,
distal, stem/haft, lateral blade, wedge, barb, proximo-medial, medio-distal, barb/
stem, barb(s) missing, other, and indeterminate. The 8 potential breakage types or
causes are: bending, overshot, perverse, step fracture, hinge fracture, distal crushing/
impact, lateral fracture/impact, and indeterminate. Breakage locations could include
distal, medial, proximal, barb/shoulder, haft/stem, longitudinal, and indeterminate.
Bifaces and Biface Fragments
A variety of bifacial implements such as perforators, knives, choppers, adzes,
gouges, and wedges have defined forms and characteristic patterns of use and
constitute types of formal tools. Bifacial tool identifications are based on Turner
and Hester (1999) and technological attributes. The two bifaces were coded by tool
type, completeness, fragment type, breakage type/cause, raw material type, presence
or absence of thermal alteration, and outline shape. Potential fragment types are:
whole, proximal, medial, distal, lateral, wedge/medio-lateral, proximo-medial,
other, or indeterminate. Breakage types that could be represented consist of whole,
bending, overshot, perverse, step, hinge, distal crushing, lateral fracture, multiple
causes, thermal, or radial. Observations on biface type, fragment type, and breakage
type were employed to infer cause(s) of biface and discard where possible. Metric
dimensions recorded were length, width, thickness, and weight.
Unifaces
Formal unifaces described and illustrated in archeological reports on Texas
Spanish missions can best be classified as scrapers, end scrapers, or convex scrapers
(Inman 1999; Lohse 1999; Tomka 1999a). But these assemblages also include a
variety of miscellaneous unifaces and minimally modified or retouched flakes. For the
most part, formal unifaces are comparable to end and side scrapers associated with
Late Prehistoric lithic assemblages and represent a general technological continuity
between the Historic and Late Prehistoric periods. Unifacial tools are formally
shaped specimens with moderate to substantial working edge modification restricted
to one face of the parent flake or chunk. Tools may sometimes exhibit minimal
bifacial shaping or bifacial flaking along the working edge from resharpening. These
implements are commonly assigned to categories based on the location and type
of retouch along the working edge (e.g., end scraper, side scraper, end/side scraper,
perforator, or graver).
Edge-Modified Flakes
Edge-modified flakes do not appear to have any deliberate shaping or retouch
on any edge or surface, and any modification is probably due to their use as tools.
Attributes recorded for these implements are tool type, completeness, raw material,
maximum length, maximum width, and maximum thickness. The presence or
absence of thermal alteration was also recorded.
Some edge-modified and utilized (but not retouched) tools are functionally
identical to, but morphologically distinct from, some of the formal unifacial tools

199

(such as unmodified flakes used as end or side scrapers). Others tools are minimally
modified, if at all, and may include gravers, perforators, burins, radial-break
tools, and unretouched flakes that display use wear from a variety of tasks. The
identification of specific types of edge-modified flake tools is based primarily on
location and morphology of the functional edge. Functional assessments were based
on microscopic and macroscopic use wear, with determinations made by examining
edge wear location, tool edge shape, and characteristics of use wear. Flake tools with
unifacially distributed microscars/microflaking were interpreted to have been used
for scraping tasks, while those with more or less bifacially distributed microscars are
interpreted to have been used in cutting or sawing tasks. Similarly, small pointed
implements with edge rounding, polish, or crushing along the tip and edges of a
small projection were interpreted as drills or perforators, depending on the nature
of the wear. Wear patterns for various tool motions follow descriptions by Tringham
et al. (1974), Odell and Odell-Vereecken (1980), and Odell (1981).
Cores and Tested Cobbles
Cores include all angular lithic chunks with evidence of single or multiple
flake removals. Shafer (1973) and Studer (1982) have demonstrated the importance
of the bipolar technique for lithic industries exploiting small pebble- or cobble-sized
raw materials, and recent analyses by Tomka (2002) documented the importance of
the bipolar technique at Mission Rosario. Tomka also notes an emphasis on blade
and flake core reduction techniques and a scarcity of the kind of bifacial manufacture
and bifacial core reduction that is common in Late Prehistoric and Archaic lithic
assemblages.
Variables coded for cores, core fragments, and tested raw materials are core
type, completeness, raw material, maximum length, maximum width, maximum
thickness, weight, heating intensity, number of striking platforms, cortex type, and
principal flake removal pattern. Completeness was recorded as whole or broken.
Heating intensity was recorded as none, light, or heavy. Type of cortex was recorded
as chalky or crusty, stream worn, patina, or none. The principal flake removal pattern
indicates the most common pattern or direction of flake removal and often corresponds
to the number of striking platforms and the initial shape of the raw material. Potential
flake removal patterns consist of unidirectional, bidirectional, multidirectional, radial/
centripetal, opposed, and indeterminate (usually for core fragments).
Unmodified Debitage
Debitage was subjected to a technological analysis to look at size distributions
and basic flake shape information (Ahler 1989:25). Size grading provides a quick yet
reliable method of acquiring dimensional data that can be useful in comparisons with
other sites. This type of analysis also is an efficient means of deriving behavioral and
technological information from large samples of flaking debris commonly recovered
by archeological projects. The categories used are: Size Grade 1, <6.3 mm (<1/4 inch);
Size Grade 2, 6.3–9.5 mm (1/4–1/3 inch); Size Grade 3, 9.5–12.5 mm (1/3–1/2 inch);
Size Grade 4, 12.5–19.0 mm (1/2–3/4 inch); Size Grade 5, 19.0–25.0 mm (3/4–1.0 inch);
Size Grade 6, 25.0–37.5 mm (1.0–1.5 inch); and Size Grade 7, 37.5–50.0 mm

Chapter 8: Analysis of Native-Made Lithic Artifacts of Unknown Origin

(1.5–2.0 inch). The sorting was done using a series of sieve screens. The amount of
dorsal cortex remaining on flakes was recorded in three states: none, 1–50 percent,
and 51–99 percent.
A primary attribute recorded for the debitage was flake type, and each
specimen was classified into 1 of 19 possible technological states. Flake type
assignments represent qualitative evaluations of flake origin based on an array of
technological characteristics and overall morphology. Observations recorded for each
flake consist of flake type, cortex amount, raw material, and size grade. Comments
were recorded if the piece appeared to exhibit deliberate heat treatment or other
unusual technical aspects. All debitage from excavated contexts was completely
analyzed according to the scheme discussed above.
UNMODIFIED DEBITAGE
A total of 603 pieces of unmodified debitage were recovered. Four raw
materials are represented: locally available Edwards chert (n = 574), limestone
(n = 12), quartzite (n = 16), and sandstone (n = 1). Edwards chert is common in the
area, occurring as weathered cobbles in surface upland settings and as stream-worn
and battered cobbles within drainages.
Size Grade Variability
The unmodified debitage was sorted into seven size classes (Table 8.2).
The general distribution of flakes and fragment sizes is typical of lithic production
strategies dominated by generalized hard-hammer reduction or bifacial reduction
of cobble- and large pebble–sized chert nodules (Figure 8.1). The predominance of
a generalized core reduction strategy is confirmed by the sizes and types of cores
present (see below). Noting that the smallest size class is under-represented because
the flakes will usually pass through a 1/4-inch screen, the flake assemblage is
dominated by flakes smaller than 19 mm. The high frequency of flakes in the smaller
size classes is a pattern documented in several Spanish mission lithic assemblages
by Tomka (1998:31, 1999a:37, 1999b:33, 2000:104, 2001:34, 95, 2002:267). The
consistency of this pattern suggests that there was a degree of stability in the
methods selected for flake tool blank production and the way in which cores were
reduced.
Flake Types
Eleven types of flakes were
identified: bifacial (both biface edge
collapse segments and biface edge
resharpening flakes), soft hammer,
hard hammer, core rejuvenation,
blades, indeterminate fragments,
technological shatter (from lithic
r e d u c t i o n ) , t h e r m a l s h a t t e r,
hammerstone spalls, and nodule
fragments. The presence of such

variability suggests that at least two or three different flake production or tool
manufacture techniques were used—bifacing or soft hammer, general core reduction
or hard hammer, and blade flake production. One question is whether this mix of
different technologies indicates that the lithic assemblage includes materials from
different time periods. All three of these flake production methods are documented
to varying degrees as part of other mission assemblages (Tomka 1999a, 1999b;
Tomka and Fox 1998, 1999; Tomka et al. 1999). Although a flake-blade technique is
suggested as part of the technology, these specimens were not derived via indirect

Chapter 8: Analysis of Native-Made Lithic Artifacts of Unknown Origin

percussion or the punch technique, as their technological signatures are not present
in this assemblage.
As shown in Table 8.3, the most abundant type of debris is indeterminate
flake fragments, primarily medial and distal pieces, which account for 40 percent of
the debitage. Other flake types are soft hammer and hard hammer, which combined
account for 18 percent. Bifacial flaking debris (biface edge collapse pieces, overshot
flakes, and biface/tool edge resharpening) is infrequent at 2.4 percent. Flake blades
are also infrequent (1.5 percent) but coincide with the presence of some possible blade
cores. Approximately 16 percent is identified as technological shatter, which is not
surprising given the predominance of flake production from cores and hard-hammer
and soft-hammer flaking techniques. Core reduction and biface manufacture both
generate substantial amounts of shatter during the knapping process. None of the
debitage in this assemblage exhibits attributes characteristic of bipolar percussion.
The presence of bifacial manufacture debris and soft- hammer flakes is interesting
given the scarcity of bifaces and biface fragments.
It is possible that a temporally mixed assemblage might exhibit size grade
differences among the different flake types. However, this is not the case here, since
all of the more important flake types exhibit the same general size trend with more
flakes in the smaller size classes (see Figure 8.1). The exception to this is in hardhammer flakes and flake blades, which have a more-even distribution across size
grades and no significant peak in the small size classes. Although hard-hammer
flakes and flake blades have smaller total numbers, the patterns reflect a size grade
trend that is probably associated with differences between techniques: generalized
hard-hammer flake production versus late-stage bifacial thinning, retouch, and
maintenance. Other researchers have demonstrated that different flake production
methods or manufacture techniques produce different size distribution patterns in
the associated debris (e.g., Ahler 1989; Dockall 1991; Gunn et al. 1976; Henry et al.
1976; Newcomer 1971; Stahle and Dunn 1982, 1984).
Based on the size data distributions for
each major flake type, the following observations
can be made. The skewed distribution of bifacial
flake types and soft-hammer flakes toward the
smaller size grades (25.0–6.33 mm) strongly
indicates finishing of late-stage bifaces, biface
resharpening, and probably small tool retouch,
despite the scarcity of bifaces in the assemblage.
While a predominance of small debitage in an
assemblage can reflect intentional maintenance
and cleaning of work areas, the parsimonious
explanation is that the flake size data reflect lithic
technology rather than maintenance behaviors.
Although the PAI excavations occurred in the
vicinity of wattle-and-daub structures along the
south wall of the mission compound, the spatial
and contextual evidence is not sufficient to know

whether particular excavation units were inside or outside the structures or inside
or outside the stockade wall.
There is no evidence of vertical separation between the major debitage types,
so it is impossible to infer any temporal distinctions in lithic technology. Bifacial
flake debris is vertically associated with the generalized core and flake production
material. It is not possible to determine if the bifacial flake debris and soft-hammer
flakes are older than the other debitage types. The bifacial and soft-hammer flakes
may indicate that late-stage preforms were finished there or that finished bifaces
were maintained there but that the debris was discarded elsewhere on the site or
even offsite.
Cortex data were used to assess the degree of core preparation prior to flake
production and the stage of core reduction or tool manufacture. An examination of
chert debitage by cortex amount and size class indicates that some cortex is present
among all size classes (Figure 8.2). The amount of cortex reflects hard-hammer
reduction of local chert cobbles, a general absence of special core preparation, and
the mixing of debitage produced by both hard-hammer and soft-hammer techniques.
With generalized core reduction, regardless of the flaking technique, cortex can be
removed at any time during the flaking process. In contrast, during biface production,
surface cortex is usually removed early in the manufacture sequence.
CORES AND TESTED COBBLES
A total of 19 cores and core fragments and 1 tested chert cobble were
identified in the assemblage. All are local Edwards chert, which occurs as weathered
cobbles mantling upland areas on both sides of the San Saba River valley. This is
indicated by the presence of the following cortex types: chalky or crusty (n = 7),
stream worn (n = 11), and no cortex (n = 2). The cores were subdivided into complete
percussion flake cores (n = 4), blade cores (n = 4), core fragments (n = 8), tested
cobbles or pebbles (n = 1), and split cobble fragments (n = 3). Cores generally show
no significant patterns in terms of cortex variability. The blade cores all retain
some stream-worn cortex. Two flake cores have stream-worn cortex, and 2 have
chalky/crusty cortex. The 3 split cobbles all retain chalky/crusty cortex. Three
core fragments have stream-worn cortex, 2 have chalky/crusty cortex. The single
tested cobble also has stream-worn cortex. Only the blade cores appear to show
some selectivity of raw material based on cortex, but it is unclear whether this
was a technological choice.
The presence of percussion flake and blade cores corresponds to the variety
of flake blanks used to manufacture expedient flake tools and unifaces. These types
of cores are equally represented. Three of the blade cores are unidirectional in flake
removal pattern, and one is multidirectional. The same pattern of flake removal is
represented in the percussion flake cores. The predominance of unidirectional flake
removal has been noted for other mission assemblages and appears to be related to
the generalized core reduction mode of flake production and the overall expedient
nature of the technology utilizing locally occurring raw materials. Abundance of

Chapter 8: Analysis of Native-Made Lithic Artifacts of Unknown Origin
raw materials did not require complete reduction of cores, and the cobble shapes
(i.e., more rounded than tabular) may have limited the number of directions from
which flakes and blade flakes of suitable size and shape could be removed. For
complete cores, the number of striking platforms visible varies from one to three.
Five specimens have one striking platform, two have two platforms, and one
has three platforms. Of the four percussion flake cores, two appear to have been
discarded due to internal flaws, and one was secondarily reused as a hammerstone.
The fourth exhibits only one flake removal, but the size of the flake indicates that

it is a tested cobble.

The single tested cobble is an irregularly shaped chert cobble with weathered
exterior cortex. At least two percussion flake scars on one surface appear to represent
material testing and reveal that the chert appears to be heated to a pinkish gray.
There is no indication of surface heating on the exterior, and the heating could be
incidental rather than intentional heat treatment.
The split cobble fragments (n = 3) are undoubtedly the result of reduction
processes associated with core trimming and shaping and perhaps establishing a
simple striking platform to produce blades and flakes. All exhibit a chalky/crusty
exterior cortex.
Of the eight core fragments, one is a rejuvenation flake from the bottom
of a blade core to remove hinge/step areas prior to further blade removal. The
other seven are angular fragments of broken cores but exhibit flake scar remnants
to identify them as core fragments. Two exhibit internal fractures, and one is
battered.
DART POINTS
Two dart points were recovered. One is a fragmentary stemmed specimen
that compares favorably to a Marcos in stem characteristics (Turner and Hester
1999:147–148). It is a proximo-medial portion refit from two fragments. The basal
stem edge is convex, and the lateral stem edges are straight to concave. Fracture
characteristics indicate that the dart point was broken during impact. Both barbs/
shoulders are broken, and the stem snapped in a transverse bending fracture. On
its distal end, the blade is broken transversely by multiple longitudinal impact
fractures that propagated down the blade faces and lateral blade edges. The raw
material is a light to medium brownish gray chert that appears to have been heat
treated.
The second dart point is an untypeable blade fragment with remnants of the
upper stem area. The raw material is a mottled light and dark gray heat-treated
chert. This specimen was also damaged by multiple impact fractures that snapped
the blade transversely, some propagating down one lateral blade edge in a cascade of
step fractures. Below the transverse fracture on each blade face are small, multiple
spinoff fractures also characteristic of impact fractures. The stem is broken from the
basal edge toward the blade, and both barbs/shoulders are incomplete. A remnant
portion of the basal edge suggests the stem base was concave in shape. The specimen
does not appear to have been reworked after being broken.
These artifacts are certainly not stylistically or technologically a part of any
known mission Indian lithic technology. They could have been procured by mission
Indians or Spaniards to serve as raw material for future manufacture into other
tools (e.g., for reuse as gunflints). Amick (2007) provides ample documentation of
this type of behavior prehistorically and in later lithic assemblages. Several sources
indicate that Archaic unifaces, bifaces, dart points, and other suitable fragments were
occasionally picked up and refashioned into gunflints or other similar implements
by mission inhabitants (e.g., Lohse 1999:271; Tomka 1999a:250–251, 1999b:30).

Chapter 8: Analysis of Native-Made Lithic Artifacts of Unknown Origin
SCRAPERS
Six implements exhibit sufficient systematic percussion retouch that they
can be identified as unifacial scrapers. One specimen is a small angular chert flake
fragment of what appears to be heat-treated material. It exhibits controlled pressure
or light percussion flaking along one lateral edge. This retouch has created a slightly
concave edge, but no appreciable or identifiable wear traces are present.
One uniface is manufactured from light and dark gray banded chert. It is
an interior percussion flake with lateral edges that have been subjected to at least
two episodes of unifacial percussion retouch. The two edges converge to a blunted
tip roughly in line with the long axis of the original flake. Resulting retouched edge
angles are approximately 45º. Edge wear is visible on both edges and is characterized
primarily by unifacial microscarring with step and hinge terminations. The presence
of some bifacial wear suggests that the implement could be a unifacially retouched
cutting tool rather than a scraping implement. Also, although they are retouched,
the edges are not quite regular in outline. It appears that these edges would not
have worked efficiently in a scraping motion. A straight segment of one lateral edge,
toward the proximal end of the flake, has no retouch but does exhibit light cutting
wear. On both edges, the percussion retouch flake scars are not very invasive onto
the dorsal surface, but they do exhibit hinge and step terminations.
A convex end uniface was manufactured from a secondary percussion flake
of dark brown chert. It has percussion retouch on the distal end and one lateral
edge. The distal end has been modified into a convex shape, while the lateral edge
is essentially straight. Edge retouch is localized and not invasive onto the dorsal
surface. The opposing edge has not been modified, and it appears that no modification
for hafting is present. No evidence of haft wear was observed, and no appreciable
wear is present on the retouched areas.
Three fragments are interpreted as distal convex ends of unifaces.
Similarities in breakage patterns suggest these specimens may have been broken
in use, during resharpening, or possibly as a way to rejuvenate the end of the tool.
A retouched distal flake fragment with some dorsal cortex has stream-battered
dorsal cortex, and the chert is fine-grained gray material. The flake was broken
in a transverse bending fracture behind the convex retouched end. Soft-hammer
percussion retouch is present along the convex end and on a portion of one lateral
edge. No use wear was observed. The second example is similar in form but smaller
in size. It, too, exhibits a transverse bending fracture immediately proximal of the
retouch. The fragment represents the retouched distal end of a percussion flake.
The retouch is abrupt and steep. Use wear is confined to the immediate edge and
is characterized by unifacial microscars with step terminations and slight edge
rounding and abrasion associated with scraping. Characteristics of the transverse
fracture suggest that it may have been done deliberately by hitting the tool while
it was placed on an anvil. The third specimen is the distal end of a percussion flake
of mottled gray and light tan chert. A transverse bending fracture is also present
on this specimen. Retouch is limited to one side of the distal end and has been used
to create a concave aspect along that part of the edge. Minimal retouch along the

207

208

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
other side of the lateral edge has served to create an overall convex appearance. No
traces of use wear were observed.
INDETERMINATE UNIFACES
Nine specimens are classified as indeterminate unifaces. They are retouched
flakes and fragments that lack the uniformity of retouch characteristic of the formal
unifacial tools described above. Rather, the forms and locations of retouch on these
unifaces are variable, suggesting multiple functions as expedient tools. None of the
specimens exhibit evidence of use wear, and their precise functions are not known.
One specimen is a small flat piece of white or gray translucent grainy chert or
chalcedony. All edges have been nibbled to create a roughly rectangular shape with
on offset point at one end. The retouch resembles that observed on small expedient
unifacial arrow points or arrow point preforms. A second similar specimen with
identical retouch was made on a small brown translucent flake or flake fragment.
The third example is a small retouched cortical flake fragment of dark gray chert.
Percussion retouch was used to create the general shape; this specimen may be an
expedient unifacial tool or core fragment.
Three minimally modified flakes or flake fragments are best described
as denticulates. Each is characterized by an irregular or scalloped edge created
by percussion retouch. The first implement is a distal fragment of an interior
percussion flake of banded dark brown chert. The specimen was heated, but the
burning appears to be postdepositional. A portion of the distal edge has three
percussion scars removed to create three small isolated projections or beaks
along one edge. No definite use wear was observed. Some light microscarring is
present adjacent to the beaks, but this may be associated with retouch rather than
use. The piece exhibits a transverse but irregular break that may be a thermal
fracture. The second tool is a distal fragment of a cortical brown chert flake broken
by a transverse bending fracture. Portions of the lateral edges have been lightly
nibbled or retouched to create two edge projections. Light unifacial edge crushing
and step fracture scars are present in the edge concavities. This is characteristic
of scraping of a hard material and may be evidence of how the tool functioned. A
third denticulate is a percussion flake of gray fine-grained chert with light retouch
along its distal edge. This retouched edge is lightly scalloped in appearance, with
three to four isolated beaks or projections depending on how the edge is viewed. Use
wear appears limited to two of these projections and is characterized by rounding
and blunting, with some light tip crushing. Each of these projections appears to
have been used as a graver.
Two proximal percussion flake fragments are probable haft elements
from convex end scrapers. The retouch on both fragments is limited to the lateral
edges near the striking platform and is alternately unifacial. Consequently, both
specimens have a slightly beveled cross section shape. No use wear is present on
either fragment, and the observed retouch is likely to be haft element modification.
One is a light tan, lustrous fine-grained chert, but the luster is not due to heat
treatment. It has a transverse bending fracture. The second fragment is a medium

Chapter 8: Analysis of Native-Made Lithic Artifacts of Unknown Origin
gray to brown fine-grained chert. It has no evidence of use wear but does have a
large hinge fracture.
A final miscellaneous uniface is made of fine-grained gray/olive mottled
chert. This piece may be a flake fragment, but it is too heavily modified or damaged
to be sure. Small edge nibbling retouch is present along one convex lateral edge,
but no use wear was observed. A percussion flake removed from this edge suggests
that the edge retouch may represent platform preparation similar to the prepared
edges associated with biface thinning. This may be a recycled biface fragment, but
the edge retouch indicates that its final use was as an expedient unifacial tool.
EDGE-MODIFIED FLAKES
Five implements are edge-modified flake tools. All appear to be of local
Edwards chert, and two appear to have been deliberately broken on an anvil. One
is an interior bifacial thinning flake. No retouch is present, but small unifacial
feather- and step/hinge-termination microscars are present along one convex lateral
edge of the ventral surface. This wear type and pattern are characteristic of tools
used in scraping tasks.
The second specimen consists of a medial section of a large cortical flake
that was struck from a thermally altered core or cobble. The weathered cortex is
heat reddened, and the interior chert is glossy and reddened. The fragment exhibits
bending or transverse snap fractures, both proximal and distal, that created broken
faces with obtuse angles. One broken edge has very small unifacial microscars with
step fracture and feather terminations associated with use in a scraping task.
The third edge-modified flake is a probable medial section of a large cortical
flake. Transverse fractures are present proximally and distally. One of these is a
hinge or reverse hinge fracture that has rounding, matte polish, and abrasion on
the fracture edge. This use wear appears to have been produced by scraping a softer
but abrasive material, perhaps animal hide or fibrous plant material. The other
transverse break exhibits a fracture face indicative of deliberate breakage on an
anvil. It could not be determined if the use wear occurred before or after the flake
was snapped.
The fourth specimen is an interior percussion flake with bifacial microscars
with step and hinge fractures clustered along one convex lateral edge. There also
appears to be light edge battering along a thickened lateral edge on the opposite side,
perhaps indicating that this flake was used briefly as a wedge or similar implement.
The fifth edge-modified flake tool is the proximal or proximo-medial end of
a large interior percussion flake or blade. Use wear along one convex lateral edge is
characterized by small bifacial clusters of feather-termination microscars that give
the edge an irregular or scalloped appearance. This type of wear is typical of tools
used to perform cutting tasks. The material being cut cannot be inferred because
some of the wear has been damaged postdepositionally. The distal end of the flake
is missing and has longitudinal and transverse fractures that intersect near the
flake edge. Some crushing and fractures on the dorsal surface near the intersection
of these fractures may indicate that the flake was broken on an anvil.

BIFACIAL KNIFE
An incomplete biface fragment is a portion of well-made knife blade of
brown-gray Edwards chert. It consists of the base and most of the blade, which was
broken in a transverse bending fracture and was partially reworked along one edge
by light unifacial percussion retouch. It does not appear to have been heat treated
prior to manufacture. The bifacial flaking on both faces was well executed, with
biface-thinning flake scars meeting at the middle of the blade. The lateral edges
are straight, converging toward the distal end, and the basal edge is concave and
was thinned and shaped by removal of a series of well-controlled pressure flakes
from both faces. One corner of the base is broken and was not repaired. In flaking
technology and size, this specimen is comparable to a Gahagan or Friday biface
(Turner and Hester 1999:254–255).
INDETERMINATE BIFACE
A very small biface tip or basal fragment of brown chert was broken in a
transverse or bending fracture, and it appears to have been alternately beveled by
pressure retouch. It could not be determined if this fragment was part of an arrow
point, dart point, or some other bifacial implement.
COBBLE TOOL
A single chert cobble tool has a weathered smooth cortex on both surfaces
and along one edge. Portions of both surfaces were modified by direct hard-hammer
percussion to create an irregularly shaped bifacial bit or cutting edge. The raw
material is a mottled tan and gray fine-grained chert. There is no indication of heat
treatment or other thermal alteration. Although no interpretable use wear was
observed on the worked edges, it does appear that the tool went through multiple
episodes of resharpening or flaking, and its morphology reflects an expended tool
that was discarded at the end of its use life.
BATTERED TOOLS
An elongated chert cobble was employed as a hammerstone and anvil.
The raw material is mottled/banded yellow and black chert with black specks
throughout. A portion of the cobble edge is broken, presumably by impact through
use as an anvil. One surface is moderately bruised with multiple overlapping
ring cracks, step fractures, and pitting, and one end has battering from use as a
hammerstone. Two other large pebbles exhibit wear from use as hammerstones.
One specimen is waterworn sandstone or coarse-grained red quartzite with pitting
and battered areas on two faces and one end. The second is a small hammerstone
of waterworn gray quartzite. Light battering is present on one surface. Both of
these hammerstones would have been suitable for retouching small flake tools,
unifaces, and bifaces.

Chapter 8: Analysis of Native-Made Lithic Artifacts of Unknown Origin
THERMAL ALTERATION OF NATIVE-MADE LITHICS
Table 8.4 summarizes the Native-made lithic artifacts by evidence of
thermal alteration. What is readily apparent is that most of the assemblage
(n = 523; 80 percent) exhibits no evidence of heating. Twenty-six unmodified
flakes, 2 edge-modified flakes, and 1 core exhibit signs of minimal heating that
most likely represents intentional heat treatment. This leaves 103 unmodified
flakes, or 17 percent of the total debitage, with evidence of intensive heating. These
specimens may have been burned during the attack and burning of the mission.
The horizontal and vertical distributions of the intensively heated debitage are
examined in Chapter 12.
CONCLUSIONS
The 651 lithic artifacts that are not obviously associated with the mission
occupation are hard to interpret because it is unclear who made them and how
they got to the site. They could relate to use by Late Prehistoric or Protohistoric
groups before the mission occupation, mission Indians during the brief occupation
in 1757–1758, Norteños who attacked the mission in 1758, or historic Native groups
who camped there after the mission was destroyed. All of these are possible, and
some combination of them is likely.
Evidence suggests that contributions by Indians living at the mission may
have been limited. The mission was occupied for only 11 months, and only a small
number of Native Americans lived there at any one time (see Chapter 2). Excluding
any Spaniards who may have been part Native American, the Native population
consisted of 9 Tlaxcaltecan neophytes who were brought up from Mexico, a few
Apaches who were elderly or ill, and possibly a few of the Spaniards’ wives. At
the time of the mission attack, only 7 people were specifically identified as being
Indian—an Apache interpreter named Ignacio, Ignacio’s wife, 2 Apaches, and 3
San Antonio mission Indians (i.e., Tlaxcaltecans). It is possible that 2 others were
Indian—a soldier’s wife and the wife of the mission administrator—but no records
specifically identify them as such (Hindes et al. 1995:Table 2; Wedel 1964:70). Taking
all of the historical documents into account, it is reasonable to conclude that the total
population of Native Americans living at Mission San Sabá was probably less than
15 people at any one time. Roaming bands of Apaches visited on their way to and
from buffalo hunts, but they were not part of the mission population and camped
outside the mission (see Chapter 2 and Appendix B).

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
While they were few in number, it is hard to image that Native Americans
living at the mission did not engage in traditional stone tool making to some
extent. These activities would have been limited but could have have resulted in
deposition of some of the lithic materials. The archival records provide no meaningful
observations of people making or using stone tools, so if that did occur, it was not
observed by Spaniards or was such a mundane activity that the Spaniards never
commented on it.

CHAPTER 9: ANALYSIS OF THE VERTEBRATE
FAUNAL REMAINS
Brian Sawyer Shaffer

INTRODUCTION AND METHODS
The vertebrate remains recovered were analyzed to identify the types of
taxa present and assess exploitation patterns and site formation issues related to
the Spanish occupation. A total of 774 specimens were analyzed. This small sample
did provide some insight into activities there, such as the use of imported domestic
animals—cattle, pigs, and sheep/goats—as well as postabandonment formation
processes at the site.
Specimens were analyzed using the comparative collection at the
Zooarchaeological Research Collection at the University of North Texas. Specimens
were identified to the level of order or below. Attributes were recorded using a
faunal analysis coding system (Shaffer and Baker 1992). Aside from provenience
data, attributes recorded included taxon, element, portion of element, side, aging,
weathering, breakage, burning, gnawing, and chemical etching; any additional
information was recorded in a comments field.
Specimens were tabulated using two methods. Table 9.1 lists the number of
identified specimens (NISP) and minimum number of individuals (MNI). The NISP,
or simple specimen count, was tabulated for each category of identification. The
MNI is the minimum number of individual animals that could have contributed to
the sample for each taxon identified.
The simplest method of MNI calculation is to find the most-duplicated
elements or portions of elements for a given taxon. For example, eight cottontail
rabbit specimens were recovered from the site. Each cottontail has only one left
innominate. Two left innominates were recovered, and these are the most-numerous
duplicated elements. Therefore, the MNI for cottontail rabbit would be two.
Beyond element representation, MNI may be influenced by factors such as
site aggregation parameters (e.g., activities areas, cultural levels, etc., considered
separately as unique samples and then added together) and age at death for the
animals represented. Simply put, the more ways in which the animal remains may
be tabulated, the greater the potential for the MNI result to increase. Since the site
is being treated as a single aggregate here, there is no influence on MNI. Animal
aging was taken into account during analysis, however, so it was examined relative
to MNI calculation to determine if it altered the results. Given the small sample
size, only one taxon, squirrel, was affected. While elements were not duplicated, at

least two squirrels were present in the sample as indicated by the fact that one was
subadult at the time of death and the other was an adult.
ANALYSIS GROUPS
After the NISP and MNI were calculated, the bones were divided into
three analysis groups in an attempt to sort out those associated with the
Spanish occupation. The bones were grouped as shown below based on their taxa
identifications, evidence of modifications, the archeological contexts in which they
were recovered, the degree of preservation and postdepositional alteration, and
historical factors (see Table 9.1, Table 9.2).

TAXONOMIC OBSERVATIONS

Identifications were made to the most-specific level possible. For example,
several cattle-sized specimens are most likely from cattle but are too fragmented
for identification beyond being called very large/large mammal. Other specimens
could be identified as cattle-sized large artiodactyl (i.e., cattle-sized ungulates), but

497

774

216

could not be distinguished with certainty as being elk, bison, or cattle. Lastly, some
specimens could be specifically identified as domestic cattle (Bos taurus). None of
the taxa recovered were unexpected given the geographic location of the site and the
introduction of domestic livestock by the Spanish. There is one exception, however.
Armadillo remains indicate possible postoccupational disturbance problems. This
is because the armadillo extended its range into the region around the turn of the
twentieth century (Schmidly 1983:103), after the mission was abandoned, and
therefore could not be part of the mission sample. The combination of their fossorial
nature and recovery of their remains within the site indicate that they may have
played a role in the site formation processes.
Another notable find of an intrusive nature is the recovery of skunk remains.
Nineteen specimens identified as skunk all appear to come from the same individual.
Specimens compare most favorably with the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis),
although only partial skeletal samples of the other possible species of skunk were
available for comparison and hence the identified remains were given a designation
of “cf.” for “compares favorably with.” Because of the excellent preservation relative
to most of the other bones, the skunk probably represents recent road kill.
Excluding the unidentifiable bone fragments, the overall assemblage of
Spanish and Probable Spanish bones is dominated by medium to large animals that
cannot be identified to taxa (see Table 9.1). These are simply classified as artiodactyl
bones (small, medium, and large ungulates), large/medium mammals, and very
large/large mammals. Because of the archeological and historical context, all the
very large mammal and large ungulate bones are probably bison or cattle, and the
latter is most likely because there were many cattle at the mission. When looking
at the MNI for the Spanish and Probable Spanish analysis groups, the following
individual animals are represented: large and medium mammals—1 domestic cow,
1 domestic pig, 1 domestic sheep or goat, and 1 deer; small mammals—2 cottontail
rabbits, 1 raccoon, 1 squirrel, 1 cotton rat (probable), and 1 rodent (small); and other
animals—1 bird (medium sized), 1 snake, 1 catfish, and 1 turtle.
These identifications do not necessarily imply that each of these taxa
represents an animal killed and eaten by the occupants or visitors to the mission,
but there is evidence that many of these probably were consumed as food. None of
the animals listed above is unexpected given the geographic location of the site and
the domestic animals known to have been brought to the mission. Large numbers of
cattle and sheep (but no goats) are mentioned as having been brought in the Inventory
of Supplies (see Appendix B and Chapter 14). Since goats are not mentioned, it is
likely that the bones identified as sheep/goat are from sheep. Pigs are absent from
the inventory, so it may be that the pigs that contributed the butchered bones
belonged to individuals who traveled with the expedition and were not purchased
with the mission’s funds.
TAPHONOMIC OBSERVATIONS
Taphonomic information was recorded for each specimen. As with most
archeological faunal assemblages, the greatest hindrance to identification was gross

Chapter 9: Analysis of the Vertebrate Faunal Remains
fragmentation. Processes that damage specimens include burning, weathering,
chemical dissolution, and human and animal modification (such as food processing
and gnawing). Each of these factors may destroy the bone but may first render
morphological identification difficult or impossible by obliterating exterior surface
features and key identifying landmarks.
Breakage
Of the 774 specimens recovered, all but 30 are broken. The majority of
the unbroken specimens are nonpoisonous snake vertebrae (n = 7), plover (n = 3),
cottontail rabbit (n = 3), and skunk (n = 7). Most of the sample exhibits angular
breakage patterns (n = 569). This type of breakage reflects elements that either will
not spirally fracture because of their composition (flat bones such as portions of the
skull, sternum, or some bones of nonmammals such as turtle shell and nonbone
elements such as teeth) or because they have lost their ability to break in such a
manner due to loss of collagen over time or through taphonomic processes such
as weathering, burning, or chemical leaching. Ninety-seven bones (12.5 percent)
exhibit spiral breakage, indicating that they were fractured while the bone was
still fresh and contained collagen (Johnson 1985). Whether this breakage was due
to food processing activities such as meat, marrow, or hide removal could not be
ascertained. There were no dynamic loading impact fracture localities to indicate
intentional breakage by humans (Johnson 1985).
Burning
Burning is present in 24 percent of the sample (n = 186). The majority of
the burning was in the form of charring, or the incomplete combustion of the bone
that results in a darkened and usually blackened appearance (n = 170). Sixteen
specimens exhibit evidence of calcination, a more-complete combustion of the bone,
which results in the bone turning colors such as blue, gray and, most commonly,
white. This is the final stage before the bone disintegrates.
Weathering
Weathering was recorded as being light or marked. Marked specimens
are those that exhibit fine-line fractures or flaking in planes or more-extensive
destruction. Only 14 specimens (2 percent) have marked weathering. This indicates
that the sample was buried relatively quickly such that exposure on the surface did
not produce significant damage.
Chemical Dissolution
Chemical dissolution is another process that attacks bone surfaces, and it was
readily apparent in much of the mission sample. This may be produced by such factors
as natural carbonic acids in the ground, roots, or animal digestive tracts, the latter
of which does not appear to been played a factor here. Chemical dissolution on most
of the samples (n = 187, 24 percent) was light. This means that the surfaces of the
bones show pitting or root tracks but that identifiable features were not obliterated.
Specimens with marked etching (n = 9) were seriously damaged or destroyed.

217

218

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Gnawing
Gnaw marks in faunal assemblages are usually the result of rodent activity,
but the only gnaw marks identified in this assemblage are carnivore-like puncture
and pressure marks that appear on squirrel and rabbit bones (n = 5). The rabbit
left innominate, squirrel humerus, and squirrel tibia display opposing puncture
holes. Punctures are on just one side of the rabbit right innominate and mandible.
The puncture marks on each of these specimens are quite small. It appears that
they were produced by a small carnivore or possibly an opossum. All of the gnawed
specimens were recovered from Levels 1 and 2.
The gnawed specimens all appear to be more recently introduced into the
faunal assemblage based on their exterior condition. These specimens do not exhibit
the staining or chemical dissolution present elsewhere in the assemblage. Thus, it
appears that these remains were introduced to the site much later than the mission
assemblage. In fact, the gnawed bones appear to be in similar condition to the
comparative specimens used for this analysis, as do the other squirrel and plover
(Charadriiformes) remains that were recovered from Levels 2 and 3.
Cultural Modification
Three types of cut marks were observed—hand saw, chop, and slice—and
one specimen exhibits polish. Cut taxa include a canid/deer-sized mammal specimen
with hand saw marks, a probable pig scapula with hand saw marks, a cattle-sized
artiodactyl scapula with a chop mark, a lumbar vertebra with multiple chop marks,
a thoracic vertebra spinous process chopped through, a deer-sized artiodactyl axis
vertebra with multiple chop marks and humerus with a slice mark, and a canid/
deer-sized mammal cervical vertebra chopped through. Figure 9.1 illustrates some
of the prominent butchering marks on selected animal bones
A canid/deer-sized mammal specimen is still greasy to the touch and exhibits
polish on the exterior surface rounding of the edge. This specimen appears to be
a fragment of a larger bone, so the reason for the polish and wear could not be
ascertained.
FLOTATION REMAINS
Only 81 specimens were recovered from flotation samples, and 50 of these are
associated with Feature 10. Only 2 specimens were identifiable to the level of class
or below, both deer-sized mammal rib fragments. The other specimens are too small
and fragmentary for identification below the level of Vertebrata. Taphonomically, all
of the specimens exhibit angular fractures. Four specimens are burned (2 charred
and 2 calcined; they were all found in Feature 10).
BONES FROM FEATURE 10
Feature 10 is interpreted as a bone dump, probably within a small pit
(see Chapter 11). The taxa associated with this feature are summarized in Table

cultural materials leave little doubt that Feature 10 was a Spanish colonial deposit.
Consequently, the question of whether or not Feature 10 was created by a single
event or by longer-term deposition is relevant to understanding the activities that
occurred at the mission during its occupation or perhaps at the time of its demise.

The specific animals in the Feature 10 assemblage are significant to how this
feature is interpreted. Bos taurus (cattle) is the only European-introduced species
that definitely links the feature to the Spanish period, but if the identification of
possible sheep or goat is correct, these bones also would proivide a link. The only
other identifiable animals are deer and two types of fish. Many other bones are
various-sized mammals and artiodactyls, but most are unidentifiable vertebrate
bones. Of the 137 vertebrate bone fragments from Feature 10, 50 (36 percent) are
from flotation samples, and 4 of these are charred or calcined. The low percentage
of burning could indicate that the feature was deposited sometime prior to burning
of the mission. This interpretation corresponds with stratigraphic evidence that
Feature 10 occurs below the ash layer (Feature 13) that represents the missionburning event (see Chapter 11).
Several indicators were considered as possibly useful for discerning if the
assemblage accumulated during a single event or over a long period of time. First,
the presence of matched elements from one or more individuals could be used.

Chapter 9: Analysis of the Vertebrate Faunal Remains
There is one matching set of cow leg bones (a radius and ulna) that probably were
deposited together, they do not necessarily indicate that any of the other bones are
from the same event.
A second indicator could be a stratigraphic transition of animal types from
indigenous taxa to historic domestic taxa, which would imply deposition over
aperiod of time. The Feature 10 assemblage consists of commingled indigenous and
domestic taxa with no separation, however. Thus, there is no indication of changing
taxa over time.
A third indicator could be evidence in the form of animals (age and taxa)
that occur only in specific seasons or multiple seasons. The latter would indicate
the pit feature was left open for an extended period of time. For example, remains
of deer fawns that would correlate with a fall kill could be found alongside remains
of migratory birds that were only in the area in the late spring. No such seasonal
indicators are represented in the Feature 10 taxa, however.
Cultural modifications to the faunal materials are another potential indicator.
For example, the assemblage could show a transition from the use of stone tools
to the use of metal tools via the cut marks present on the bones. Or, there could be
lenses of burned and unburned bones representing different episodes of deposition.
No such patterns were discerned in the assemblage.
A fifth line of evidence could be the inclusion of intrusive fauna, if the Feature
10 pit were left open for any length of time. Pit features, wells, cisterns, sinkholes,
and caverns can all entrap animals that fall into them. Whether or not the animals
are able to safely escape is influenced by many factors, such as the depth of the hole,
the steepness of the sides, infilling with water, inclusions within the hole such as
other debris, and the size and capabilities of the intrusive animals. Whyte (1988)
specifically addresses the issue of small vertebrates becoming entrapped in cultural
pit features. He conducted experiments to determine the factors that influence how
and why small vertebrates become intermixed with cultural deposits in pit features.
The rate of entrapment will depend on several variables. For example, entrapment
will be influenced by animal traffic. If the pit is on a game trail, or in a location that
eventually becomes part of a game trail, the rate of entrapment will increase given
the amount of traffic. Animals that become entrapped may attract more by calling.
As noted by Whyte (1988), the types of animals typically entrapped in cultural
pit features are smaller taxa such as frogs, toads, shrews, and mice. Such taxa
should be represented by complete or nearly complete skeletons, or at least be well
represented by multiple elements. None of these small taxa were noted in Feature
10, and none of the recent bones were found in Feature 10. As a result, there is no
evidence that the Feature 10 pit remained open over time.
With the possible exception of the scarcity of matched elements, there is
little evidence that Feature 10 represents an accumulation of osteological specimens
over an extended time frame. This is not proof that the bones represent a single or
short-term deposition episode, however. The data only indicate that multi-episode
or long-term deposition is not in evidence.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
SUMMARY
Analysis of the skeletal remains produced some interesting results in spite
of the small sample size. In regard to site formation processes, some recent animal
bones were introduced and indicate some degree of postdepositional disturbance,
and the armadillo remains hint at potential disturbances by burrowing animals.
In general, however, the recent bones are easy to distinguish from the older bones
that are associated with the mission occupation.
The faunal remains indicate that the human diet at Mission San Sabá was
composed of a mixture of wild and domestic species. There is some evidence of burning
of bones, and a variety of butchering marks (i.e., cut, chopped, and hand sawn) on
certain animals. The wild taxa in the Spanish and Probable Spanish analysis groups
are quite limited and consist of catfish, turtle, nonpoisonous snake, rabbit, raccoon,
rodent, and deer. But it is the European-introduced species—and the butchering
marks on them—that are most revealing (Table 9.4). The only identified taxa with
butchering marks are domestic European-introduced cattle, pig, and sheep (goat
is less likely). It is likely that the medium to large mammal bones with butchering
marks are from these domestic species. Bones of these animals are common at
Spanish colonial sites in Texas. The butchering marks were made by at least three
types of metal tools: a hand saw, a smooth-bladed knife, and a large chopping blade.
Also interesting are the types of elements that exhibit butchering marks. All of the
marks are associated with medium to large animals and are found on the spine or
the pectoral girdle. Acknowledging that there could be some sampling bias, this might
reflect a cultural preference in butchering practices or the selective discarding of
certain body parts. Finally, the matching set of cattle leg bones (a proximal radius
and ulna) from Feature 10 is typical of the kinds of low-yield meat bones that would
have been discarded at a Spanish colonial mission.
As noted, several animals postdate the mission occupation and probably
represent recent intrusions. The armadillo bones are definitely a late addition.
However, compared to the plover remains and some of the rabbit and squirrel
bones, the armadillo remains show significantly more degradation due to chemical
dissolution (especially as observed in the section of dermal armor recovered from
Level 2). This indicates that all of the plover and some of the squirrel and rabbit
remains probably postdate the recent historic armadillo remains. The well-preserved
skunk bones also represent a recent introduction, and the number of specimens
and element identifications suggest that a single individual died and was quickly
buried, either through natural means or by people.
The final observations relate to site formation processes. The site appears
to have suffered some postdepositional disturbances since recent faunal remains,
some of which are in nearly pristine condition, are mixed with mission occupation
remains. This occurs primarily in Levels 1 and 2, but some recent bones were found
in Level 3. These deeper finds may reflect, at least in part, the burrowing activities
of armadillos and other fossorial animals. The presence of small carnivore gnawing
and puncture marks on some rabbit and squirrel bones also indicates that these
elements were introduced to the site through natural carnivore activities.

CHAPTER 10: ANALYSIS OF MACROBOTANICAL
REMAINS
Leslie L. Bush

INTRODUCTION
Macrobotanical material from both excavation were analyzed. The samples
are from 71 lots of screen-recovered samples collected from the 1997 Texas Tech
University (TTU) excavations and 97 lots of screen-recovered samples and 11
flotation samples from the Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) investigations. It
was decided to include the previously excavated TTU samples to provide a more
comprehensive look at the botanical remains recovered from Mission San Sabá.
The nature of the mission site dictated the goals of this analysis. Because
Mission San Sabá had a temporary wooden stockade and wattle-and-daub
structures that were burned during the 1758 attack, much of this analysis focused
on the identification of woods (charred, semicarbonized, and unburned) that were
used for construction and for the various wooden objects used at the mission (e.g.,
furniture, boxes, and crates). But this analysis also looks at the nonwood charred
plant remains to infer other aspects of mission life such as plants used as food.
The analysis concludes with a comparison of plant remains found at Mission San
Sabá with plants described in various Spanish inventories, including the San Sabá
Inventory of Supplies.
SITE SETTING
Mission San Sabá is situated in the central Edwards Plateau, where the
characteristic upland vegetation is grassland interspersed with clusters of trees
and brush (Gould 1962). Common tree species in the uplands are plateau live oak
(Quercus fusiformes), scalybark oak (Q. sinuata), Lacey oak (Q. glaucoides), Buckley
oak (Q. buckleyi), and persimmon (Diospyros texana). Juniper (Juniperus ashei)
and mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) are common today on the central plateau but
were probably less so in the eighteenth century (Riskind and Diamond 1988:11–12).
Cedar elm (Ulmus crassifiolia), hackberry (Celtis spp.), and juniper are present
on mesic slopes. At least three acacia species are present in the central Edwards
Plateau (Acacia angustissima, A. greggii, and A. roemeriana). Other acacia species
more common in the Trans-Pecos or south Texas brush country may also extend
their ranges into Menard County. Skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata), evergreen
sumac (R. virens), and elbowbush (Forestieria pubescens, also called stretchberry) are
common Edwards Plateau shrubs (Riskind and Diamond 1988). Agarita (Mahonia
trifoliata), cow-itch vine (Cissus trifoliata), and greenbrier (Smilax bona-nox) are
often found in the understory.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Floodplains of the central Edwards Plateau contain a wealth of tree
species, most of which are represented in the woods recovered from Mission San
Sabá. Moisture-loving baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and sycamore (Platanus
occidentalis) are nearest the stream channel.54 Pecan (Carya illinoinensis), American
elm (Ulmus americana), and boxelder (Acer negundo) are common in riparian zones
away from the actual stream channel, with cedar elm and hackberry still farther
away (Riskind and Diamond 1988; Wagner n.d.).
Soils on the Edwards Plateau are typically shallow, underlain by limestone or
caliche (Gould 1962:12). Average rainfall in Menard County was 22.2 inches (56.4 cm)
for the period 1951–1980 (Natural Fibers Information Center 1987). Data for the
same period show an average last frost on March 31 and an average first frost on
November 6 for a growing season of 220 days. Relative to modern conditions, the
area immediately around Mission San Sabá would have been much wetter during
the 1757–1758 Spanish occupation. Modern agricultural pumping has significantly
reduced the flows of the San Saba River and Harris Hollow. Many spring locations in
Harris Hollow are still being pumped today, and water no longer flows in the channel.
The site area has been under cultivation for at least a century. The field was
planted in alfalfa at the time of rediscovery in 1993. Deep plowing has impacted most
of the deposits, except for a 2–3-m-wide strip along the south fence line. In addition to
disturbances of plowing and fence post impacts, the site is also occasionally affected
by flooding. Smaller, lighter materials such as charcoal may have been swept away
during periodic flood events.
METHODS
The flotation samples were processed at the PAI laboratory in a Flote-Tech
flotation machine with bottom mesh openings of 1.0 mm. Flotation heavy fractions
were inspected for charcoal, which was removed by hand and added to the light
fractions prior to sorting. Flotation samples were sorted according to standard
procedures (Pearsall 2000) at the Macrobotanical Analysis laboratory in Manchaca,
Texas. Each flotation sample was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200x0.01-g electronic
balance before being size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh.
Materials that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm) were completely sorted,
and all carbonized botanical remains were counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled.
Uncarbonized botanical material larger than 2 mm (rootlets and the occasional
Although baldcypress trees occur in Menard County today, their age is uncertain. Dr. Bill
Doolittle, an irrigation specialist from the University of Texas at Austin, has stated that they
date to the Spanish occupation of the area (Jennifer McWilliams, personal communication 2011).
Dr. Jake Landers, a local resident who specializes in native plants of the county, believes that
the baldcypress trees were planted in 1936 as part of the Texas Centennial Program (Jennifer
McWilliams, personal communication 2011). Baldcypress belongs to an ancient genus whose
fossil records date at least to the Miocene (Soltis et al. 1992). Baldcypress today occurs in riverine
habitats throughout the southeastern United States, extending as far north as Delaware along the
Atlantic coast and up the Mississippi, Wabash, and Ohio Rivers into Illinois and Indiana (Elias
1980). Since rivers act as migration corridors for plants (Diggs et al. 2006:129; Lee 1945) and the
area around the mission is believed to have been wetter in the past than currently (see Chapter
4), it would not be surprising if baldcypress occurred there during the eighteenth century, or
during any part of the Holocene. Hence, baldcypress is considered local or potentially local in this
analysis. Like other “local” species, however, it could have been brought to the mission from other
areas where it also occurred. In this context, it should be noted that baldcypress trees are more
common today on the southeastern portion of the Edwards Plateau, including the San Antonio
area, than in the interior of the plateau (Simpson 1999).

gastropod) was weighed, recorded, and labeled as “contamination.” Materials
that fell through the 2-mm mesh (“residue”) were examined under a stereoscopic
microscope at 7–45x magnification for carbonized botanical remains. Identifiable
botanical material other than wood was removed from residue, counted, weighed,
recorded, and labeled. Other uncarbonized macrobotanical remains were recorded
on a presence/absence basis on laboratory forms.
Plant samples that were not processed by flotation were not usually sieved
in the laboratory. Rather, any chunks of soil were removed by hand. When loose soil
was encountered, samples were placed on a No. 10 mesh (2 mm), and the soil that
fell through the mesh was scanned for plant material. Residue smaller than 2 mm
from the PAI investigations was discarded, but residue from the TTU investigations
was weighed and retained. Nonbotanical items larger than 2 mm, such as bone and
daub, were counted, weighed, and recorded for transfer to the appropriate analyst.
Some TTU lots were stored in more than one container when they arrived at
the Macrobotanical Analysis laboratory. In some cases, the division into containers
appeared meaningful (e.g., corn kernels in one vial, wood charcoal in another), so the
contents of containers were not mixed, even when they had the same lot number. For
large samples such as TTU’s Lot 673, which was contained in 20 boxes, a subsample
of containers were examined in their entirety. All other containers were scanned
for types of material that did not occur in the subsample. When such material was
encountered, the entire contents of the container were analyzed.
Wood or wood charcoal identification was attempted for at least 20 specimens
from each container, or for all specimens when fewer than 20 were present. In
selecting samples, unusual-looking specimens were given priority to ensure that
maximum variability in the sample was captured. Thus, less-common woods such
as hoptree and mulberry are likely to be overrepresented in this analysis. Wood
charcoal fragments were snapped to reveal a transverse section and examined
under a stereoscopic microscope at 28–180x magnification. Because the fresh
and semicarbonized material was dry and relatively fragile, clean sections for
identification were obtained by snapping specimens in the manner of wood charcoal
even though the wood was uncarbonized. Occasionally, wood samples were cut
with a razor blade to obtain clean sections. When necessary, tangential or radial
sections were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and
sizes of intervessel pitting, and other characteristics that can only be seen at higher
magnifications.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level
by comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection
and through the use of standard reference works (Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993;
Hoadley 1990; InsideWood 2009; Martin and Barkley 1961; Panshin and de Zeeuw
1980; Schoch et al. 2004l Schopmeyer 1974). Botanical nomenclature is from the
PLANTS database (USDA, NRCS 2010); common names are taken from the same
source unless local usage differs (e.g., Simpson 1999). Criteria developed by Phil
Dering (2000) were used for separating Prosopis and Acacia wood. Percent fiber (as
opposed to parenchyma) in transverse section was used as the primary criterion, and
the number of pores in latewood clusters was a secondary criterion, since latewood

anatomy was not always fully expressed in these specimens. Within the genus Carya,
specimens were assigned to Carya illinoinensis (pecan) when banded parenchyma
was apparent in the earlywood. Otherwise, they were assigned to Carya sp. (hickory).
RESULTS
Most of the plant remains collected are wood and wood charcoal. A list of
woods identified in the screen samples is shown in Table 10.1, and Figure 10.1 shows
the relative frequencies of woods by species and type. No additional woods were
identified in the flotation samples. Nonwood plants from screen samples are shown
in Table 10.2. Tables 10.3 and 10.4 detail the plant remains recovered by flotation
processing of sediment samples. Table 10.5 presents data for all of the samples that
represent potential structural woods. Appendix E contains detailed provenience
information for all of the botanical materials recovered.
Uncarbonized, Semicarbonized, and Modern Plant Remains
Uncarbonized plant remains found at archeological sites are usually
considered modern intrusions because they are a common natural occurrence, and
they are often not associated with human occupation. Uncarbonized seeds may
represent the natural seed bank awaiting germination in the soil, while uncarbonized
roots are usually associated with recent plants. And material from the soil’s humus
layer such as grass stems, nut hulls, and evergreen needles can work its way below
the surface through natural processes, or even be transported to deeper levels on
the boots of excavators. Separating these modern introductions from archeological
plants is not difficult in most cases because the sites are too old and the conditions
not right for preservation of these remains. Mission San Sabá, however, is a relatively
young site, so it was expected that some eighteenth-century plants might have
survived in uncarbonized form.
Therefore, for this project, not just the state of carbonization but the plant
species and part identified were considered in determining whether a category of
plant remains would be considered archeological or modern. These determinations
of associational contexts for all the flotation samples are shown in Table 10.3.
For this analysis, semicarbonized plants other than bark are treated as
archeological, since there is substantial overlap between taxa that appear in
semicarbonized and fully carbonized forms. Approximately half of the corn kernels—a
plant known to have been used at the mission from historical records and recovered
exclusively from feature contexts—are semicarbonized, lending additional support
to the theory that semicarbonized materials from the eighteenth-century mission
survived.
Carbonized Noncultural Plants
Because the mission burned in a catastrophic event, some wild plant parts
that occurred naturally may have burned and become preserved archeologically. This
might include parts of plants that were growing or lying on the ground and incidental
seed rain. Although carbonized and semicarbonized seeds are usually considered

cultural—i.e., indicators of food use by site inhabitants—in this case many of these
seeds are identified as noncultural because they probably burned in the mission fire.
Therefore, the eight small seeds recovered in carbonized and semicarbonized form
from Features 6 and 10 are interpreted as eighteenth-century seed rain (see Table
10.4). These consist of little barley (n = 3), other grass family (n = 2), Chenopodium
(n = 2), and daisy family (n = 1). Little barley (Hordeum pusillum) is a close relative
of the European domesticate, common barley (H. vulgare). With maximum length of
only 2.5 mm, however, the San Sabá specimens are surely the native wild species.

Little barley is a short grass that is common on disturbed sites throughout Texas
(Gould 1978). Although the seeds are edible, like most grass seeds, they require
threshing and winnowing. They are unlikely to be an economical food choice when
corn kernels and wheat flour are available, as at Mission San Sabá. Chenopodium,
many grasses, and most members of the daisy family are also weedy species that
flourish near human habitats.

Archeobotanical Remains
Wood
The unburned and charred wood could come from four main sources:
(1) structural woods associated with the stockade and wattle-and-daub structures;
(2) brush that was piled against the stockade and structural walls by the attacking
Indians setting fire to the mission; (3) charcoal from cooking fires; and (4) wooden
furniture, boxes, and other objects used there. The latter could include items made
at the mission as well as items brought in the supply train from Mexico City.
Four categories make up 80 percent of the wood and wood charcoal identified
(see Figure 10.1). Acacia and mesquite, the largest category at 32 percent of specimens
for which identification was attempted, are related genera of the legume family
(Fabaceae). They are common in upland sites on the Edwards Plateau. At Mission
San Sabá, they may represent wood used in the construction of the wattle-and-daub
buildings. In fact, acacia species are so frequently used for wattle worldwide that
“wattle” is one common name for the genus. Alternatively, the acacia and mesquite

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá

Chapter 10: Analysis of Macrobotanical Remains
may represent brush collected by the attackers, who apparently approached the
mission from the upland side rather than the river. Pecan/hickory (18 percent)
and oaks (18 percent) are the next-most-common woods recovered. Surprisingly,
pine is the fourth-largest category (14 percent), even though it does not grow in
the San Sabá area. Although it is possible that pine numbers are inflated due to
sampling bias, wood fragments that appeared to be pine were not given priority
for identification unless no pine had been previously identified from that sample.
It is highly unlikely that the pine represents structural wood, and the most likely
scenario is that the these samples represent wood from containers and furniture
such as chests, crates, and cupboards.
Some wood charcoal probably represents fuel from cooking fires.
Archeologically, the context of individual samples and the diversity of identified
charred woods must be considered when interpreting the origin of the wood. Fuel
wood is a likely interpretation when several different taxa are present in the same lot.
Structural wood is more likely when only a single taxon is present. This
was the case for the 63 lots shown in Table 10.5. However, some lots in Table
10.5, especially the nonlocal woods and those with small sample sizes, are not
readily interpreted as posts or wattle. The table presents all the woods that could
be structural, but it does not attempt to identify which one are the most likely
candidates. To infer which woods most likely represent structural remains, the
archeological contexts must be considered.
PAI Features 1, 4, 6, and 9 are identified as Spanish or probable Spanish
post features (see Chapter 11), and charred, semicarbonized, and unburned wood
was recovered from Features 1, 6, and 9 (see Tables 10.4 and 10.5, Lots 370-A,
371, 378–382, and 389). The woods recovered from Feature 1 are pecan (Carya
illinoinensis), hickory (Carya sp.), and oak (Quercus sp.), but pecan and hickory are
dominant and this post was probably pecan. The wood associated with Feature 6
is Acacia sp. and Acacia/Prosopis, so this post was probably mesquite with acacia
wattle. And the wood associated with Feature 9 is some type of white oak (Quercus
subg. Quercus). Thus, the woods used as structural posts were pecan, mesquite,
and white oak. Including these, the complete list of woods most likely to have been
used in building the stockade and wattle-and-daub structures are as follows: acacia,
mesquite, pecan, hickory, ash, juniper, mulberry, plateau live oak, red group oak,
white group oak, soapberry, and elm. It is likely that more structural woods will be
identified when the feature contexts of the TTU botanical samples are examined.

Food Plants

CROPS
Corn, beans, and hazelnut constitute the domesticated food plants recovered,
but all three were probably imported. Although the missionaries planned to farm,
and an irrigation canal had been started, no crops are believed to have been grown
during the mission’s brief existence. The general guidelines that priests were to

237

238

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
follow indicate that corn was to be planted in May or June and beans in June (López
1940). If corn supplies were low, an additional crop could be planted in February or
March. Other crops such as cotton, fruit, watermelon and other melons, and chili
peppers are also mentioned as being grown at missions (López 1940). However, when
the mission party arrived on April 18, 1757, there was little time to build living
spaces and prepare fields and irrigation features to meet these planting dates. In
addition, the growing season in Menard County during the twentieth century was
45 days shorter than the growing season in San Antonio—220 days as opposed to
Bexar County’s 265—a difference that may have taken the settlers by surprise
(Natural Fibers Information Center 1987). It is likely that the mission occupants
were getting ready to plant corn or beans when the attack occurred in March 1758,
but they could not have harvested a crop yet. The Inventory of Supplies confirms
that large amounts of corn and beans were brought to the mission, and it was stores
of these supplies that were carbonized when it burned.
WILD PLANT FOODS
Consumption of wild plants is mentioned at other eighteenth-century Texas
missions (López 1940), but no wild plant foods were recovered in these investigations.
As discussed above, the carbonized little barley, though edible, is better interpreted
as eighteenth-century seed rain. The hazelnut is very likely a Eurasian import (see
below). Wild plant seeds are often small enough that they are only recovered by
flotation processing. Given the small number of flotation samples analyzed (n = 11),
the lack of wild seeds is not surprising. The lack of pecan nutshell is more puzzling.
Pecans are abundant near Menard, and pecan/hickory wood is the second-mostabundant taxon in the wood assemblage (see Figure 10.1). Nuts were considered
a useful food resource, as the presence of almonds in the Inventory of Supplies
indicates, so it is possible that processing and discard of wild food plants took place
in a portion of the site that was not uncovered during the investigations.
SACRAMENTAL FOODS
Sacramental wine and communion wafers are plant products critical to
Catholic ritual. All of the ingredients used to make wafers—wheat flour, communion
wine, and oil (usually olive) are listed or implied in the Inventory of Supplies, and a
wafer press was recovered from the site (McWilliams 2001). However, no evidence
for wheat, grapes, or olives was recovered. Like the food plants, they seem to have
been imported, and any plans to produce them locally were never carried out. If
whole grapes were used, the seeds would very likely have been preserved, and grape
seeds have been recovered from wine-producing Spanish colonial sites in South
America (Ruhl 1993). In any case, any grape cuttings brought to the mission would
have taken at least two years to produce fruit, leaving the mission dependent on
imported wine or production from local wild grapes in the meantime. Two species of
wild grapes are known in Menard county today: mustang grape (Vitis mustangensis)
and gray-bark grape (V. cinerea). But these species appear to have been little used
in wine production before the nineteenth century, when the phylloxera-resistant
roots of the latter grape helped rescue the European wine industry (Turner 2009).

Chapter 10: Analysis of Macrobotanical Remains
Plants Mentioned in Texas Mission Historical Records
Table 10.6 lists all plants mentioned in historical inventory documents for
Texas missions and whether they have been recovered in archeological investigations.
Most of these do not show up in the Mission San Sabá assemblage; conversely, some
of plants recovered archeologically at the mission are not mentioned in historical
records. The vast majority of these archeology-only plants are tree species used for
construction or fuel.
In addition to wood, hazelnut (Corylus sp.) is the other plant recovered that
does not appear in historical records. Hazelnut shrubs are native to the eastern
United States, Europe, and Asia. The species of hazelnut could not be determined
from the San Sabá specimen, which is an achene (nut) without the husk. The
semicarbonized specimen is small, 8 mm in length, or about half as long as most
Corylus species. It may have been discarded as defective. Hazelnut reported from
Spanish colonial sites in St. Augustine, Florida, was considered a European import
(Reitz and Scarry 1985). Hazelnuts appear in the manifests of ships bound for
Florida, and native hazelnuts grow too far from St. Augustine for easy procurement
(Reitz and Scarry 1985:58). The San Sabá specimen is even more likely to be a
European import, since no native hazelnuts grow within 400 miles. The nearest
wild plants are American hazelnuts (Corylus americana), which grow along the
Red River in Arkansas, Louisiana, and east-central Oklahoma (USDA, NRCS 2010).
Nonlocal and Local Wood
Most woods recovered are local or probably local (see Tables 10.1 and 10.5).
For this analysis, plants were considered local if a member of the genus is known
presently or historically from Menard County. But there remains the possibility
that even these plants could be nonlocal. Many genera have species that occur on
more than one continent. For instance, wood identified as Platanus could possibly
represent the Oriental plane tree (Platanus orientalis) of southeastern Europe, but
because sycamore occurs on the San Saba River today, the specimens are identified
as Platanus occidentalis.
The preponderance of local woods is not surprising. It would not have been
economically feasible to import the quantities of wood necessary for construction
of temporary mission buildings, especially when the material could be acquired
locally at no cost (except labor). Other local wood no doubt represents fuel that the
attacking Indians piled against the mission’s stockade and structures to help ignite
it during the attack.
Only four types of wood do not occur locally. These probably are woods
imported as furniture, church ornaments, utilitarian items, or containers used in
transportation such as chests or wagon boxes. These are Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga
sp.), two types of pine (Pinus sp; hard and soft groups), and chestnut (Castanea sp.).
Although true hickory does not occur in the area, specimens assigned to hickory
genus (Carya sp.) rather than pecan (Carya illinoinensis) are categorized as local
for several reasons. First, the specimens are small, and the banded parenchyma
that would indicate a pecan assignment is not present. Also, true hickories hybridize

*Notes on Sources:
The Inventory of Supplies is the listing of items specifically purchased for use at Mission San Sabá (see Chapter
14 and Appendix B). Items that were acquired without an exchange of money would not have been recorded in
this inventory.
The three transfer inventories used in this table were created in 1772 and are published by Almaráz (1980)
and Leutenegger (1977). Transfer inventories were created when administrative control of a mission was
transferred from one college to another (see Chapter 14).
Fray Jose Franco López (1940) provided a report on the state of the Texas missions in 1785. The document
includes a short section on each of several missions, including a census of how many Indian families lived at
each place. The remainder of the document consists of general notes on missions.

with each other and with pecan hickories. The specimens may represent hybrids
and/or unusual specimens of pecan (Carya illinoinensis) or possibly black hickory
(C. texana), which occurs in the area and is reported to have pecan-type wood.
The single specimen of Douglas fir was recovered from PAI’s Lot 213 (Level 2
of Unit AW17). One species of Douglas fir in North America is Pseudotsuga menziesii,
which occurs throughout the Rocky Mountains, including mountainous regions of
Mexico, New Mexico, and isolated ranges in Trans-Pecos Texas. Another species,
P. lindelyana, occurs in the Sierra Madres of Mexico. One species of Douglas fir, P.
macrocarpa, grows only in the mountains of southern California (Elias 1980). There
are also two species and various subspecies native to East Asia. Douglas fir is an
important timber that often grows in pure stands (Elias 1980). Today, it is used
principally for building and construction, but it is also used in cooperage, fencing,
and the manufacture of boxes, pallets, and crates (Alden 1997). The Inventory of
Supplies mentions fir tree resin, which may have been intended for medicinal

purposes (McWilliams 2001). Douglas fir resin has many documented medicinal
uses among Native Americans (Moerman 1998), but it is not clear wither the fir in
the Inventory refers to Douglas fir or a true fir of the genus Abies, whose fifty-some
species occur widely in mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere.
Two types of pine are evident. Pine labeled Type 1, or hard pine, is dense,
strong, and slow growing with large, distinct latewood. Often specimens are broken
at the transition between earlywood and latewood, making the abruptness of the
transition difficult to discern. The break at the transition suggests it is abrupt,
however. This pine is consistent with the group known as hard pine, diploxylon pines,
or Pinus subg. Pinus. There are many potential sources for hard pine. Ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa), the most likely identification, is found in mountainous
areas from British Columbia to central Mexico. It is the near-universal material for
Spanish colonial furniture in New Mexico (Vedder 1982:10). Hard pines also occur
in east Texas and Europe.
Pine referred to as Type 2, or soft pine, is less dense and exhibits uneven
growth rings, very narrow latewood, and an abrupt transition from earlywood to
latewood. Species known colloquially as white pines and piñon pines typically
exhibit this anatomy. Technically, they are the haploxylon pines, which belong to
Pinus subg. Strobus and P. subg Ducampopinus. The only white pine that occurs
in Texas is southwestern white pine (P. flexilis, also known as limber pine), which
is present in the Davis Mountains of Texas, New Mexico, and a few spots in westcentral Mexico. Piñon pines in the southwest and northern Mexico include Mexican
piñon (P. cembroides), found the mountains of northern Mexico and a few locations
in west Texas, and Colorado piñon (P. edulis), which grows in most of New Mexico
and a few locations in west Texas (Elias 1980; Simpson 1999). European species
such as Swiss pine (P. cembra), Mugo pine (P. mugo), and Austrian pine (P. nigra)
are also soft pines.
The final wood type that could not have been collected locally is chestnut. The
single specimen comes from TTU’s Lot 690, associated with Feature 26. According
to excavation notes, the feature is a “trash burn pit, probably in use prior to the
attack.” The six screened lots contained a wide variety of woods, plus some bark. The
earlywood in the chestnut wood specimen is generally only one or two pores wide
and occasionally discontinuous. It is therefore unlikely to be American chestnut
(Castanea dentata), which is associated with the Appalachian mountains of eastern
North America. It is possibly Allegheny chinkapin (C . pumilla), whose range extends
from New England into east Texas. There is little evidence linking material culture
at Mission San Sabá with the east Texas missions, however, and the specimen more
likely represents a European or east Asian Castanea.
Unidentified Nonlocal Plant
One unusual charred specimen recovered by TTU warrants additional
discussion. A piece of dense, homogenous material that appears to be botanical in
origin was recovered from (TTU Lot 655, Feature 6, post stain 33) and may be a
nonlocal plant (Figure 10.2). No interior vessels or exterior seedcoat are present,

Chapter 10: Analysis of Macrobotanical Remains
and even the overall shape of the original plant part is not clear. One facet of the
material is flatter than the other, suggesting a cotelyon, but the flat surface is
sufficiently undulating that this interpretation is not entirely secure. The only
morphological attributes that can be determined from the fragment are texture,
density, and minimum size. Interpretation of even these minimal attributes assumes
that the material represents an intact plant part rather than some kind of ground,
burned, and compacted flour.55

Figure 10.2. Unidentified botanical specimen by TTU (Lot 665, post
stain 33, Feature 6).

The texture and density of the material are reminiscent of hickory nutshell.
The texture is homogenous, vesselless, and very dense. The fragment measures
50.02x35.26x20.58 mm at its thickest. Several possible identifications were
considered and rejected. It is too long to be avocado (Persea americana, which also
has some interior variation in tissue) and too thick to be the kernel of a mango seed
(Mangifera indica; although the texture and density are good matches). Tagua palm
kernels (Phytelephas aequatorialis) match the specimen well in size and density,
but they have numerous interior vessels.
Ojo de benado seeds are known to have been present at the mission. Seeds
of buckeyes (Ungnadia spp. and Aesculus spp.) and sea beans (Mucuna spp.) have
a long history as ojo de benado charms (Hildburgh 1906). The kernels of Ungnadia
and Aesculus are insufficiently dense to match the Lot 655 specimen, although the
largest Aesculus would be large enough. Mucuna seeds are members of the legume
family that split into cotyledons, and their size and density are a good match to the
specimen from Lot 655. There are approximately 100 species of Mucuna worldwide
(Kirkbride et al. 2000). The 20 Mucuna seeds in the comparative collection are
M. sloanei or possibly M. urens. The largest diameter of any specimen is 31.5
mm, and the thickest cotyledon measures approximately 10 mm. Kirkbride et al.
A description and photographs of the material have been submitted to Paleobot.org for
examination by other specialists (Unknown Record 7).

(2000) give maximum seed diameters for the 32 Mucuna species they examined as
37x36x17.5 mm. Thus, it appears that Mucuna seeds are also not a good match to
the Lot 655 specimen. It is possible, however, that the Lot 655 specimen represents
an unusually large Mucuna seed or an unusually large-seeded species of Mucuna
that was not among the 32 species examined by Kirkbride et al. (2000).
For now, the Lot 655 specimen has been classified as “botanical,
indeterminable” since so little of its anatomy is available to support an identification
and no likely matches were discovered.
CONCLUSIONS
Plant remains at Mission San Sabá provide a unique perspective on how
the mission was situated in the global procurement system of New Spain. All of
the domesticated food plants recovered were imported, whether from San Antonio,
Querétaro, or as far away as Mexico City. The wood species identified are mostly
local, or at least potentially so, reflecting the extensive use of large quantities of
local construction materials that were ultimately burned in the mission attack and
perhaps dry brush that was piled against the stockade and structure walls by the
attacking Indians to start the fires. Samples recovered from three PAI features
include woods that are known to have been used as structural posts—pecan, acacia,
and white oak—but many other types of wood were probably used.
A few nonlocal woods likely were from imported furniture or containers such
as chests and wagon boxes used in transportation. The situation in the emerging
mission at San Sabá contrasts strongly with that of established presidios in Arizona
and northern Sonora, which were largely self-sufficient (Williams 1992). The mission
existed for only 11 months, and it is not surprising that a movement toward local
production and self-sufficiency is not reflected in the archeological plant remains.
The inhabitants had not yet had time to complete their irrigation system or harvest
any food crops when the mission was destroyed.

CHAPTER 11: FEATURES
Twenty-eight features were identified during the PAI excavations (Table
11.1). Seven are recent historic or modern features found south of the road, and 9
are recent historic or modern features found north of the road, primarily fence posts.
Nine features—4 postholes, 3 ash or soil stains, a bone cluster, and a concentration
of Spanish artifacts—are Spanish or probable Spanish.
The features were classified into three groups: natural, recent historic or
modern, and Spanish colonial. The natural features are soil stains associated with
tree roots. The 16 recent
historic or modern features

NATURAL FEATURES
Two linear features (Features 5 and 16) and one circular feature (Feature
14) were identified as natural soil stains representing recent bioturbation. All are
very similar in fill texture and color, and they are interpreted as old tree root stains.
One of the linear anomalies was traced to an existing tree stump.
Feature 5
A linear feature was first identified in Unit AE9 at the bottom of Level 5
at 98.70 m (Figures 11.2 and 11.3). Immediately above the linear feature, a soil
transition was noted, with a distinct change from a very dark grayish brown to dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2 and 4/2) silty clay of the surrounding matrix to a black to
very dark brown (10YR 2/1 2/2) with less clay. The grayish brown material intruded
into the lower brown material, creating a distinct linear stain 16–20 cm wide and
oriented southeast-northwest. The band of darker soil ran from the southeast
corner of the unit to the central portion of the west wall. In the southeast corner,
the feature was indistinct, possibly due to a disturbance that had been noted from
the near ground surface and included some gravelly matrix. A few small rocks or
gravels were noted, primarily in the southeast corner, but no artifacts or charcoal
were observed in the linear discoloration.
The adjacent unit to the west (AE10) was excavated to continue exposing the
feature. Here, too, it was first observed at the bottom of Level 5 (98.70 m). In this unit, the

discoloration ran only 10–15 cm before it was truncated by another disturbance
along the north-central wall of that unit. Two units to the south were then opened
to follow the feature. Unit BE9 contained only a strip of it in the northeast corner,
but the discoloration continued well into Unit BE10. The distinct linear feature
continued through Unit BE10 at 98.70 m, but it was obscured somewhat by the
darker A horizon soil at that elevation. At this point, the linear feature was 2.3 m
long and ranged from 19 to 22 cm wide.
Based on maps from Texas Tech University’s (TTU) previous investigations,
structural wall trenches had been observed north of this linear feature, and Feature
5 was initially thought to be a continuation of those wall trenches. Profiles were cut
from 99.70 to 99.60 m at various points through the linear feature. The trench fill
was screened, but only a few small noncultural pebbles were recovered, along with
one flake from a nonfeature portion of the profile. The trench was determined to

249

250

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
be only 5 cm deep in all locations, and a rotted tree root was encountered near the
northwest end. One of the profiles cut through the disturbed portion of the feature,
and this disturbed area was determined to be a modern posthole and designated
Feature 12.
After much excavation, examination, and recording, Feature 5, a 3.2-m-long
linear soil stain, was determined to be a tree root scar. Only with additional exposure
did a slight tapering of the stain become apparent. The proximity of this feature to
a large rotting tree stump north of the right-of-way fence, along with the fact that
the linear stain aligned with the stump and tapered in the opposite direction, led
to a confident conclusion that this feature was a root scar.
Feature 14
Two circular stains were first observed in Unit AE5 in Level 4 (98.80–
98.70 m) immediately below the transition from dark to light soil (Figure 11.4).
Feature 14, a circular stain in the southwest quadrant of the unit, was slightly
grayer than the surrounding soil, with small snail shell fragments observed in the
fill. Feature 15 was an oblong soil stain that extended into the unit’s north wall and
appeared to be associated with fence construction (see Recent Historic or Modern
Features, below). The Feature 14 stain was bisected midway through the level, with
the east half removed and collected as a sample. One piece of charcoal was found.
The stain continued into the floor of the unit but tapered by 2 cm. A larger cross
section continued down 22 cm before the feature clearly tapered almost to a point
and veered northward. The Feature 14 soil stain was determined to be a root mold.
Feature 16
A dark linear stain stretched across Units AE11 through AE14 and into Unit
BE14 at 98.70 m (see Figure 11.2). The feature continued beyond these excavation
units to the northwest and southeast. When it was first encountered, the feature
looked like it might be a wall trench. The linear feature was traced laterally for
4 m and remained very straight. However, as observed in Feature 5, the Feature
16 soil stain also tapered gradually, from 12 cm wide in the northwest corner of
Unit AE11 to 6 cm wide in the northeast corner of Unit BE14, and a smaller linear
stain branched off of the main stain in Unit AE11. A cross section exposed the stain
extending only 2–3 cm deep with a rounded bottom. No artifacts were recovered in
the fill. Once the entire feature was exposed and examined, it was clear that it was
a tree root scar that originated at the tree trunk north of Unit AE9 and tapered in
the opposite direction.
RECENT HISTORIC OR MODERN FEATURES
The late historic or modern features include 14 post features that are clearly
associated with old property fence lines (see Table 11.2). These were found during
machine scraping and were assigned “PS” or “PN” numbers indicating that they
were modern posts found south (PS) or north (PN) of the road. Later, these were
assigned feature numbers. All 14 consist of posthole soil stains with remnants of wood

posts in place. Six are well-preserved posts (Features 18–23) that form an east-west
line south of and parallel to FM 2092, and they undoubtedly represent a historic or
modern fence line. Eight post features were found north of FM 2092, 7 oriented in
an east-west line. A long strand of barbed wire was connected with U-shaped fence
staples to many of these posts.
The late historic posts were identified by the excellent preservation of
remnants of wooden posts and the sharp contrast between the posthole fill and the
surrounding natural sediment. All are considered to be remnants of former property
fence lines that predate 1954, when the old county road was improved and expanded
into FM 2092. The distances between the posts were measured, and they appear to
have been placed at 20-ft increments.

251

252

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Feature 12 is an oval soil stain found during the investigation of Feature 5.
It was first thought to be a Spanish colonial feature. It was found at the junction
of four units (AE9, AE10, BE9, and BE10) and measured about 55x30 cm in plan
view. After thorough investigation, including an excavation to bisect and profile it,
the intrusive stain was confidently identified as a modern posthole and designated
Feature 12 (see Figure 11.2).
The other two late historic or modern features are a small circular ash stain
(Feature 2) found south of the road and an oblong soil stain (Feature 15) found
north of the road. Both are roughly in line with the old property fences and probably
represent late historic or modern disturbance associated with these fences, probably
postholes where wooden posts were removed.
SPANISH COLONIAL FEATURES
PAI excavations exposed nine features interpreted as dating to the Spanish
colonial occupation of the site (Table 11.3 and Figure 11.5). These are an ash lens,
postholes, soils stains, a bone cluster, and an artifact concentration.

Ash Lens, Feature 13
Feature 13 is an ash lens observed throughout the excavations north of
FM 2092, although it is more distinct in certain areas (Figure 11.6). It spans ca.
54 m east-west. Overall, the ash lens ranged from elevations of 99.11 to 98.92
m, being highest at the far western extent of the excavations. Ash was observed
periodically during excavations of units in Row A, and was best seen in the north
walls of these units. Based on provenience and artifact distributions, the ash lens
appears to be directly associated with the Spanish colonial occupation. The ash
lens and associated burned artifacts represent burned remains scattered across an
extensive living surface, and the most obvious sections of the ash lens correspond
closely with concentrations of burned daub in many areas.
A faint gray lens was first noted in the north profile wall of Test Unit 1
(AW20) during the testing phase. The lens, described as a fine powdery ash, was
investigated more thoroughly during the data recovery phase, when a 45-m-long
section of continuous units exposed it. At that time, the feature was described as a
sporadic, noncontiguous lens observed in the north walls of units in Row A adjacent
to the fence line. The lens was rarely noted in plan during excavations, but it could
be seen in profile after several contiguous units were exposed through Level 5
(98.90–98.80 m). The lens was first thought to be restricted to the area west of the
monument, but later examination of unit descriptions and profile photographs
showed that small sections of it were present east of the monument.
Three segments were most distinct and identified in the field as Areas 1 to
3. Area 1 spanned from W6.7 to W9.5 with elevations ranging from 99.04 to 98.98
m, Area 2 spanned from W19.5 to W21.5 with elevations ranging from 99.00 to
98.96 m, and Area 3 spanned from W26.9 to W27.2 with elevations ranging from
98.98 to 98.96 m. The lens was 2–4 cm thick in Areas 1 and 3 and 2–3 cm thick in
Area 2. A burned daub concentration spanned several centimeters immediately
below the lens throughout Area 2.
Heavy rains set in before the feature could be fully observed in situ. After
fieldwork, examination of closeup photographs of the north walls of all the units in
Row A revealed that the ash lens was much more extensive that initially thought.
Although it was discontinuous, it was observed in many locations throughout the
full east-west extent of the excavations from Unit AW46 to Unit AE8.
The lens varied in thickness from 2 to 6 cm but was fairly consistent
in elevation between 99.11 and 98.92 m (Table 11.4). There are no consistent
patterns in thickness or elevation from west to east, but the general elevation
range coincides with the level of the mission-period artifacts and burned daub
concentrations. All evidence indicates that Feature 13 represents the intensive
burning resulting from the 1758 mission attack. The nature of the deposit is what
one would expect to see. The intensity of the burning undoubtedly was variable
and left scattered pockets of intensively burned remains. Additional discussion
and interpretation of the Feature 13 ash lens in relation to other Spanish colonial
remains is presented in Chapter 12.

almost immediately in Feature 4, it
was initially discounted as a possible
mission post. Although there was
evidence of a burned wood post in Feature 1, some unburned wood was also found,
which raised two questions.What should the mission posts look like? Was it possible
that unburned wood remnants would survive inside burned posts? Although TTU’s
investigations did not address these questions, they did find preserved unburned
wood with a structural post in 2004 (Wolf 2005:56).
Feature 1
Feature 1 was exposed during the testing phase (Test Unit 1). A charred
post stain was encountered in the floor of the unit at 98.84 m (Figure 11.7). Prior to
profiling the feature, the surrounding units were searched for additional posthole
stains. When none were identified, Feature 1 was profiled in three stages, with a
series of east-west vertical profiles moving from south to north in 2–3-cm increments.
In addition to a plan view, two profiles were drawn, and digital photographs were
taken at various stages of excavation. Three stratigraphic zones were identified
in the schematic profile and designated Zones A, B, and C from west to east (see
Figure 11.7), and soil samples were collected from each zone. All three of the samples
contained charcoal.
Zone A is a thin charcoal stain about 3 cm thick on the west side of the
posthole. A few small pieces of daub were collected, and two pebbles were observed
in this westernmost stain. A piece of lightly patinated, molded clear glass was found
in a drying crack at 98.75 m below Zone A.
Zone B is the posthole fill. It consists of a large block of partially decayed,
friable wood extending from 98.78 to 98.68 m within a clear post stain that extended
from 98.74 to 98.61 m. The stain is 8 cm wide at the top and tapers to a point at
the bottom. The stained area could be the posthole, but it may also be the actual
postmold, and the edges of the posthole are not evident. The fill of the postmold was
slightly loose in contrast to the surrounding dense, compact clay loam. One large
piece of daub was collected from the fill. A second and smaller sliver of wood was

Chapter 11: Features
found below the postmold feature; it extended from 98.57 to 98.53 m and is believed
to have broken off the larger piece and fallen down into a drying crack.
Zone C was a thin deposit of charcoal with very small pieces of daub
throughout and one larger piece of daub just below the charcoal. The Zone C charcoal
and daub concentration was up to 4 cm thick (98.78–98.74 m).
Artifacts from Feature 1 include 47.5 g of burned daub and wood samples.
The primary piece of unburned wood found in the posthole (Lot 379) was identified
as Carya sp., and pieces of charred wood were identified as pecan and oak. The
flotation samples from Zone A (Lot 378) and Zone C (Lot 380) both contained charred
Carya sp. that could be pecan or hickory.
Feature 1 is aligned in a north-south orientation with three other posts
excavated immediately to the north during the 1994 and 1997 TTU investigations
(see Feature 8 in Hindes et al. [1995:Figure 6]; see Figure 11.5). PAI excavations
discovered a second Spanish post, Feature 6 (see below), 2.2 m to the southwest of
Feature 1. Rather than forming a continuation of the same north-south alignment,
Feature 6 appears to represent a post along a separate east-west wall.
It is likely that Feature 1 was a wall post associated with a wattle-and-daub
structure. Zone B clearly represents remnants of a wooden post inside a postmold
filled with decayed wood. The upper portion of the post burned, probably during the
1758 mission attack, forming a cap of charcoal at or just below the ground surface.
This protective cap resulted in the preserved section of wood near the center of the
post and below the ground surface. The remaining lower portion of the post did not
burn but decomposed in place, leaving a slightly darker stain within the postmold.
Feature 1 was a hickory post, about 8 cm in diameter, with its end intentionally
sharpened to a point. Zones A and C could represent burned daub and charred wood
fragments from the wall or roof that fell down around the post as the structure
burned. If so, the presence of charred hickory, oak, and pecan indicates that several
types of wood were used to build the structure.
If Feature 1 was a structure post, there are two plausible theories about
architectural designs that would account for the archeological remains. In the first,
Feature 1 is simply an isolated posthole along a wattle-and-daub structural wall. A
cylindrical posthole was dug, and the post was placed directly into a hole that was
only slightly larger than the post itself. The pointed base of the post was rammed
into the bottom of the posthole so that the lower part of the feature is only a postmold
with no evidence of a larger posthole. In this case, the charcoal and burned daub in
Zones A and C could simply represent burned wall materials in the upper posthole
fill where the hole was wider at or near the original ground surface. Bioturbation
at and just below the ground surface caused the mixing of the charcoal and burned
daub to a depth of 10 cm inside the original posthole, and these materials are
confined to a circular area extending about 20 to 25 cm out on all sides of the post.
A second theory is that Zones A and C represent a wall trench into which
the post was set. Wall trenches were observed during the 1997 TTU excavations and
are depicted in maps by Cavallin-Cosma (2000:Figure 5-1 and others). Although no

259

260

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
definite evidence of a wall trench was observed in the vicinity of Feature 1 during the
field investigation, the unit and feature records and photographs hint at a possible
wall trench. In several photographs that show the Test Unit 1 floor at 98.80 m, a
very faint and slightly darker and irregular linear stain, about 25 cm wide, can be
seen. It encompasses the Feature 1 stain and extends north-northwest across the
test unit. Based on Cavallin-Cosma’s (2000:Figure 5.1) depiction of Spanish features
found during the 1997 TTU excavations, a prominent north-south wall trench was
north of Feature 1, beginning just north of the right-of-way fence. The wide but
shallow distribution of burned daub and charcoal in Zones A and C of Feature 1
could represent the lower portion of a flat-bottomed wall trench. If so, only the
lowest 5 cm of the trench was present, with the upper portion unrecognizable due
to postdepositional disturbances. The intensity of burning would have been variable
along such a wall trench, and this would affect how different sections of it might
appear 250 years later. In an area subjected to intensive burning, it might contain
a mixture of burned daub and charcoal and be easily discerned. In contrast, where
burning was limited, it be impossible to identify archeologically.
Feature 4
A second Spanish post is Feature 4, also identified during the testing phase
(Test Unit 3) (Figure 11.8). Excavation in this unit was complicated by extensive
disturbances, and the Feature 4 anomaly was not fully understood when it was
investigated. It was tentatively interpreted as a modern post because it contained
remnants of relatively well-preserved wood.
The round charcoal stain was identified in Level 5 (98.90–98.80 m), in the
southeast quadrant of the unit. The northern half of the unit was covered with
scattered pebbles, and a long drying crack and a circular soft spot caused by a decayed
tree stump or roots were present west of the feature 4. These disturbed areas were
thought to be associated with an old tree and associated roots along the fence line.
The presence of a modern post was deemed reasonable in this context, although some
attributes of this feature suggested it was older than all the other modern posts.
The Feature 4 post stain consisted of a circular area of preserved wood surrounded
by ash staining measuring a few centimeters thick. Several pieces of the wood were
collected from 98.88 to 98.82 m. The unit was not excavated beyond 98.80 m, so the
lower portion of the feature was not investigated. During data analysis, Feature 4
was reinterpreted to be a Spanish post because of the condition of the wood remnants
and association of charcoal and ashy sediment. Feature 4 is much more similar to
Features 1 and 6 than any of the recent historic or modern fence posts.
Feature 6
The third Spanish posthole is Feature 6, and its fill consists of charcoalstained soil with ash and fragments of pulverized daub. The anomaly was first noted
at 98.86 m as a 30-cm-wide perfect circle. The fill was characterized by fine, lightcolored ashy soil surrounded by a pale brown ring contrasting with the surrounding
compact dark loamy clay. The feature was drawn in plan view and pedestaled while
the rest of the unit was excavated. The feature was then troweled down carefully,

and the circular stain shifted southward, exposing a darker, less-defined soil and
charcoal stain at about 98.77 m. At this point, the south half was excavated down
to 98.60 m, and a profile drawing was made (Figure 11.9). The profile revealed the
posthole was 7 cm wide at 98.77 m and tapered to 4 cm wide at 98.65 m with a
rounded bottom at 98.63 m. When the remainder of the posthole was excavated,
two pieces of preserved wood were found and collected. All of the feature fill was
saved for flotation.
Charred plant remains recovered from Feature 6 are acacia and mesquite/
acacia (Lots 370 and 371), and the two flotation samples (Lots 381 and 382) both
contained charred acacia wood. One piece of calcined bone was also recovered (Lot
371), consistent with intensive heating associated with burning of the mission.
Other artifacts recovered from the feature fill include 7.3 g of daub, one Native-made
ceramic sherd, and three mussel shells.

Chapter 11: Features
Feature 6 is ca. 2.2 m southwest of the Feature 1 posthole (see Figure 11.5). It
appears to represent a post along an east-west wall that went to Feature 1. Feature
1 appears to represent the southernmost post in a north-south wall that connects
with posts and a wall trench documented in the 1997 TTU excavations. Although
subtle evidence of a north-south wall trench may have been detected (see Feature
1), no evidence of an east-west wall trench was observed between Features 1 and 6.
Feature 9
Feature 9 is a posthole that, based on its stratigraphic context and
relationships to surrounding features, dates to the Spanish occupation (Figure
11.10). The feature was first identified on the floor of Unit AW4 at 98.90 m, where it
was mapped as a small oval charcoal and ash stain 5 cm north-south by 8 cm eastwest. The stain was mapped again at 98.84 m, where it had increased to 18 cm in
diameter and became circular. It was not visible in plan view again and thus was not
recognized as a posthole in the field. Complications in recognizing Feature 9 arose
from its context within the Feature 10 bone cluster (see below). Postfield analysis
of excavation records and photographs revealed that Feature 9 is a continuous
intrusive feature that extends from at least 98.84 down to 98.55 m.
Feature 9 contained no remnants of wood or significant concentrations of
charcoal indicative of a post, but instead had a light charcoal and ash stain in the
upper portion of the fill. The small 5x8-cm stain observed at 98.90 m may represent
the remains of the upper portion of the post itself, perhaps burned in situ. The larger
18-cm-wide, circular stain observed at 98.84 m appears to be the posthole.
Analysis of plant remains recovered identified elm and white group oak
charcoal (Lot 368), and flotation of feature fill also recovered white group oak
charcoal (Lot 389). This suggests that burned elm wood from the wall or roof of
a wattle-and-daub structure fell to the ground around an oak post. Several large
bones were found immediately northwest and west of Feature 9 between 98.80 and
98.70 m, but these are associated with Feature 10.
Discussion of Posts and Wood
Remnants of unburned wood were found along with charcoal in three of the
four postholes described above. Compared with the extremely well-preserved wood in
the modern posts, the wood remnants in these Spanish postholes are poorly preserved
and obviously much older. Schiffer (1987:173) notes that wood can survive in certain
archeological contexts for long periods, and it is likely that the preservation of this
wood was enhanced by the fact that the upper portions of the posts were burned.56
John Marvin Hunter (1937:487) visited Mission San Sabá in about 1897 and noted
“there were traces of the wooden fort remaining.” In addition, remnants of Spanishperiod wood posts were found at nearby Presidio San Sabá (Wolf 2005:56).
Unburned wood inside burned posts can be preserved for hundreds of years in the right
conditions. This phenomenon has been observed many times with burned prehistoric structures
in the Texas panhandle (Douglas Boyd, personal communication 2011). Structural wall posts
containing charred and unburned wood have been found with burned pithouses dating to the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It is clear in these cases that the charred upper portions of
posts often protect sections of the interior wood from insects and natural decay.

Chapter 11: Features
Soil Stains
Features 7 and 11 are ash concentrations or soil stains that probably date
to the Spanish occupation. This is based on their fill characteristics and their
stratigraphic positions relative to the concentrations of the Feature 13 ash lens and
the distribution of Spanish artifacts.
Feature 7
Feature 7 was observed first as a light-colored stain from 98.95 to 98.93 m in
the northern portion of Unit AW3. The stain consisted of ashy soil, charcoal flecks,
and a few burned daub fragments. The stain measured about 40 cm east-west by
24 cm north-south, but it had no distinct edges. No profile was drawn because the
stain was only 2 cm thick. In the northeast corner of the unit, and immediately east
of Feature 7, a patch of darker clayey soil was observed from 98.98 to 98.95 m. The
latter did not contain any ashy soil, charcoal, or burned daub. At the time Unit AW3
excavation was completed, the identification of Feature 7 was still unclear, and its
relationship to the darker clay soil was not certain. But during postfield analysis,
it became clear that Feature 7 was a local expression of the larger ash lens (see
Feature 13) that occurs sporadically throughout the site.
Feature 11
A shallow oval basin-shaped pit was exposed in Unit AW6 (Figure 11.11).
First noted at the base of Level 4 (98.80 m), a patch of black (10YR 2/1) soil was
observed near the center of the south half of the unit. The stain was bisected along
a northeast-southwest line, with the northeast portion being removed and screened
first. After mapping and photographing, the remaining south half was removed for
flotation. The bottom of the pit was recorded at 98.73 m. The function of the shallow
pit was not determined.
Feature 10, Bone Cluster
Feature 10 is a cluster of bones associated with some irregular and indistinct
soil stains in Units AW3 and AW4 (Figure 11.12). It was first encountered while
profiling the Feature 9 posthole in Unit AW4. Two bone fragments (vertebrae) were
found in the eastern half of the unit beginning at 98.84 m. Two glass beads (one
complete, one broken in half), six flakes, burned daub, and a burned rock were also
encountered from 99.00 to 98.90 m. More bone fragments, burned daub, and mussel
fragments were exposed in the next level (98.90–98.80 m), along with a strike-alight flint that was intensively burned (see Figure 5.13). Two heat-fractured flakes,
a nearly complete Perdiz point (not heat altered), and more bones and burned daub
were recovered from the next level (98.80–98.70 m). The Perdiz point (see Figure
5.14) was recovered in the screen, but it came from the northwest portion of the
bone concentration at an elevation of about 98.75–98.70 m.
After finding the bone concentration in Unit AW4, the adjacent Unit AW3
was excavated down to the same level (98.70 m) to try to identify the eastern extent
of the bone cluster and look for evidence of a pit. The excavation was also continued

in Unit AW5 to the west, but Feature 10 did not extend into this unit. Beginning at
98.80 m, the lower portion of the feature was bisected in both Units AW3 and AW4,
and the southern half was removed and screened. Some irregular small soil stains
were observed within the bone cluster, but no pit edges or other large soil stains
were defined. No meaningful patterns were apparent between the soil staining
and the clustered bones. Hence, the horizontal and vertical extent of Feature 10
is based primarily on the clustering of animal bones observed and mapped in the
field. The bones were concentrated in the northeastern portion of Unit AW4 and the
northwestern portion of Unit AW3, covering an area of at least 120 cm east-west
by 50 cm north-south and extending northward into the unexcavated area north
of the property fence. The bone cluster is spread vertically as much as 24 cm, from
98.84 to 98.60 m.
The stratigraphy shown in the Figure 11.12 profile illustrates the
complexity of Feature 10. The following stratigraphic zones were observed in the
north wall profile of Units AW3 and AW4: Zone I, disturbed plow zone, very dark
gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam; Zone II, upper A horizon, very dark grayish brown (10YR
3/2) clay loam with sparse limestone pebbles and sand grains; Zone III, Feature 13
ash lens, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy soil mottled with brown (10YR 5/3) clay
loam containing sand grains, tiny burned daub fragments, and charcoal flecks;
Zone IV, lower A horizon, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay with sand grains; Zone
V, B horizon, brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam; Zone VI, pocket of very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) clay; and Zone VI, pocket of brown (10YR 4/3) clay. Bones are
most concentrated at the contact between Zones IV and V but are found throughout
Zone V as well. Zones VI and VII are irregular pockets of sediment that represent
some type of disturbance.
Feature 10 is defined in a somewhat arbitrary way. A few isolated animal
bones were found close to but beyond the Feature 10 concentration and in the units
to the east and west. However, the concentration was confined to the two units, and
all of the bones recovered from Units AW3 and AW4 are considered to be associated
with Feature 10. Table 11.5 summarizes them. They are a mix of domesticated and
wild species with varying types of cultural modification.
The assemblage consists of 187 specimens, about three-quarters of which
(137 specimens) can be identified only to the level of vertebrate. Not only are most of
the bones highly fragmented, but some show clear signs of having been intentionally
broken with spiral fractures on fresh bone, butchered, or burned. Ten bones exhibit
spiral fractures, 10 are charred or calcined, and 4 have distinct chop marks or
smooth-blade (i.e., metal) cut marks. The assemblage contains 2 cow leg bones (an
ulna and radius pair) that undoubtedly represent an animal brought by the Spanish.
One bone with butcher marks is probably sheep or goat, also an introduced animal.
Although no butchering marks are present on the cow bones, a pig scapula from
another part of the site (Unit AW30) exhibits butchering marks made with a hand
saw. The rest of the assemblage is attributed to large mammal and ungulate (bison/
cow sized), medium mammal (canid/deer sized), small to medium mammal (rabbit/
canid sized), deer, and fish.

Charred wood fragments were recovered from Feature 10 as individual
samples (n = 3) and in flotation samples (n = 5). Isolated charcoal fragments were
identified as white group oak (Lot 362) and plateau live oak (Lot 369). Flotationrecovered charcoal (Lots 384–388) is mixed, and five types of wood were identified:
white group oak (n = 46), live oak (n = 8), acacia (n = 5), elm (n = 5), and pecan (n = 1).
Given its context, the diversity of animal species represented, and the variety
of modifications observed, Feature 10 most likely represents a dump of various
animal remains associated with the mission occupation. There is no evidence of
intensive burning in the Feature 10 area, so it is likely that the charred and calcined
bones and small burned artifacts (two flakes and the strike-a-light flint) were
burned elsewhere, perhaps temporarily discarded into a hearth and then dumped
at this location. The species diversity in the charred wood fragments, probably
burned as fuel, supports this interpretation. The butchered bones seem to represent
multiple processing episodes of different animals. Given the homogeneity of the
bone preservation, all the bones seem to represent remains that were deposited and
buried quickly. They could represent a single dumping episode, but their relatively
wide dispersal—as opposed to being tightly clustered—suggests one of two scenarios.
They could have been deposited during several episodes of dumping in the same spot,
or their dispersed nature reflects some degree of postdepositional disturbance. The
bone concentration occurs below the intact Feature 13 ash lens and a thin layer of
dark gray sandy clay (see Zones III and IV in the Figure 11.12 profile). This suggests
that the bone dump was associated with activities that occurred prior to the final
destruction of the mission. Because of the close proximity and small size of the
Feature 9 posthole, it is surmised that the Feature 10 bone dump was adjacent to
some a structure, possibly the southeastern corner of a wattle-and-daub structure.
Feature 17, Spanish Artifact Concentration
A large concentration of Spanish colonial artifacts lies east of the monument
in Units AE5–AE14 and BE8–BE10 and BE14 (see Feature 11.5). This concentration
covers approximately 14 m2 and ranges in elevation from 99.10 to 98.60 m. It was not
recorded as a feature during excavation. No associated soil stains were identified,
and the size of the feature is based solely on the vertical and horizontal distributions
of cultural remains.
Artifacts from this concentration includes 103.5 g of daub, 16 majolica sherds,
5 glass bead fragments, 3 pieces of lead, 2 gunflints, 1 strike-a-light, 1 wroughtiron spike, and 1 piece of basalt. Also included are 4 possible Spanish chain links,
and their occurrence in this area is further indication that these items are part of
the Spanish assemblage. The feature also contained 107 pieces of lithic debitage.
These materials constitue 32 percent of the Spanish artifacts from the site, 2 of the
3 gunflints, 1 of the 2 strike-a-lights, 16 of the 24 majolica sherds, and 5 of the 8
glass beads.
Faunal remains consist of 343 bones, including fragments from bison/cowsized mammal (n = 6; 1 with cut marks), deer/bison-sized mammal (n = 8), canid/deer
sized mammal (n = 156, 70 have been charred and 2 calcined), deer/pronghorn-sized

Chapter 11: Features
mammal (n = 1), pig (n = 1), sheep/goat (n = 1) and sheep/goat-sized (n = 1), rodent/
canid/rabbit (n = 3), turtle (n = 7, 1 has been charred), medium bony fish (n = 5),
unidentified vertebrate (n = 151, 64 have been charred), and unidentified mammal
(n = 2). Almost 40 percent are charred or calcined. This is not a result of simple
cooking activities, but rather deliberate or incidental burning that is commonly seen
when materials are discarded into a hearth or fireplace or, perhaps in this case,
heated when the mission burned.
Wood types and species identified in the include pecan (n = 6), plateau live
oak (n = 2), western yellow or European pine (n = 6), southern yellow pine (n = 1),
juniper (n = 3), mesquite (n = 3), hackberry (n = 1), and jaboncillo (n = 1). Many
of these are local vegetation common in this region, but it is possible that some of
the woods might be nonlocal and represent objects brought by the Spanish. This is
especially true of the western yellow or European pine.
Based on the density and variety of artifacts, bones, and botanical remains,
the Feature 17 artifact concentration is interpreted as the southern edge of a trash
midden that accumulated during the mission occupation. Although burned daub is
present, there are no postholes or other soil features to indicate the presence of a
structure in this vicinity. If any artifact refits were found between Feature 17 and
other parts of the site, this might support the interpretation that Feature 17 was a
trash disposal area. An attempt was made to refit some of the majolica sherds from
Feature 17 with sherds from other parts of the site, but none were found. Additional
information on the vertical and horizontal distribution of artifacts is presented in
Chapter 12.

CHAPTER 12: ANALYSIS AND
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL
DATA
Jennifer K. McWilliams, Douglas K. Boyd, and John E. Dockall

In this chapter, the features and artifacts are examined to interpret the
cultural activities that took place within the FM 2092 portion of the site. The
chapter begins with a discussion of postdepositional disturbances. Then, feature
and artifact evidence are analyzed from a spatial perspective, focusing on the
horizontal and vertical relationships and contextual associations that define the
Spanish colonial occupation. This is followed by a discussion of why the Native
American lithic artifacts found are such a problematic set of material culture,
and following that is a section addressing who made the bone-tempered pottery
and single arrow point recovered. The next section discusses the petrographic and
geochemical studies of ceramics and addresses the question of where the pottery was
made. The final section looks at the implications of the feature and artifact spatial
patterns, focusing on identifying what part of Mission San Sabá is represented in
the FM 2092 archeological sample.
SUMMARY OF POSTDEPOSITIONAL DISTURBANCES
The narrow strip of land between the north edge of FM 2092 and the northern
right-of-way fence reveals two primary types of postdepositional disturbance:
(1) impacts from multiple fence lines that marked the edge of the agricultural field; and
(2) impacts from various phases of road construction and maintenance. The roadway
evolved through time from the old Spanish trail to a gravel-covered county road and
then a paved farm-to-market highway. The road expansion project that prompted
these archeological investigations is simply a continuation of this evolution.
Historic Fence Lines and Soil Accumulation
Stratigraphic evidence associated with a buried historic fence line was used
to study the soil accumulation in the road right of way north of FM 2092. Three
separate fence lines are known to have existed along the north side of the road, and
there may have been others. One was built sometime before the 1954 improvements
that created FM 2092. The second was built around 1954, and the third and current
fence was built in the 1990s.
The existing fence consists of a 4-ft-high roll of light livestock wire fencing
(12x6 inches) with one strand of barbed wire running along the top. The fence posts
are a mix of wood stays (mostly rough-hewn cedar) and metal T-posts. It was built
sometime between 1994 and 1997, when Texas Tech University (TTU) conducted
excavations at the mission site (Grant Hall, personal communication 2007). The
273

274

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
ca. 1954 fence line runs parallel to and is associated with the current fence. When the
current fence was constructed, it was moved only slightly, possibly just a few inches.
Moving the fence required replacing some of the older posts as well as some brush
clearing. Hall noted that one of the TTU datum points was accidentally destroyed
during the 1990s brush clearing and fence rebuilding.
It is not known when the pre-1954 fence was built. When the road was
widened to create FM 2092 in about 1954, some land from both the north and south
sides of the old roadway was donated to Menard County so that they could improve
the road and add borrow ditches (Jerry Rambo, personal communication 2007).
Prior to this, the fence ran roughly 80 to 125 cm south of, and roughly parallel to,
the second and third fence lines. Remnants of the pre-1954 fence were found in the
PAI excavations, including eight wooden posts spanning a distance of about 62 m
(see Table 11.2). These posts were found as far east as Unit AE24 and as far west as
Unit BW28 and 38 m west of the monument in the final Gradall block excavation.
These posts formed a straight line that ran at a slight angle relative to the current
fence. The old fence line was about 80 cm south of the current fence line on the east
and about 120 cm south of it on the west.
Other evidence of the old fence line was observed in the excavation units
when the water accumulation had subsided after a heavy rainfall. As soon as the
water went down, a faint line of tiny gravels emerged along the old fence line in
one area. This gravel line was about 8 m long and corresponded with the fence wire
remnants described below. This linear feature indicates that gravelly dirt was once
piled along the fence line by repeated ditch cleaning and that the gravels were left
behind when erosion washed the fine-grained sediments back into the borrow ditch.
The pre-1954 fence postholes contained well-preserved wood post remnants,
and many of them had wire attached with iron stables. The lowest strand of wire
was found in situ over a distance of more than 18 m. The buried wire was found
at 99.00 m in Unit AW10 and at 99.02 m in AW28, suggesting that the bottom
strand of wire was level. The long strand was smooth wire with attached vertical
sections of woven hog wire or sheep wire, with 12-inch gaps between each vertical
wire divider. Each of the vertical wire sections had been cut, and no evidence of the
next horizontal wire remained. It is likely that horizontal wires on this fence were
spaced about 6 inches apart, as they are on the existing fence. When this fence was
replaced about 1954, the lowest strand of wire was buried, and it was easier to cut
the vertical wires all along it than pull it out and remove fence staples that were
below ground level. The lowest strand of wire was inspected from Units AW23 and
AW28, and all the vertical wires had been cut 1.8–3.0 cm above the bottom horizontal
wire. Assuming that the vertical wires were cut at the ground level, this suggests
that up to 3.0 cm of sediment accumulated on the old ground surface from the
time the fence was built until around 1954. In Unit AW28, 17–19 cm of overburden
covered the bottom strand of wire, and the vertical extension was cut at 1.8 cm high.
Thus, an additional 15.3 cm of soil has accumulated at this location since the old
fence line was abandoned. It is likely that these sediments represent the buildup
over time due to the continued road maintenance and repeated grading of borrow
ditches. Because of changes in the nature of the road (gravel to paved) and in the

Chapter 12: Analysis and Interpretations of the Archeological Data
mechanical equipment used to maintain the ditches, it cannot be assumed that the
rate of sediment buildup before 1954 was the same as that since.
A significant implication of the fact that the road was widened and the fences
moved in 1954 is that the area immediately underneath the second and current fence
lines was 80–120 cm out into the field north of the road before 1954. This means
that most of the Row A units were probably being cultivated before about 1954. It
is possible that the entire area of the excavations was cultivated, and thus exposed
to the associated disturbances, in the late nineteenth century when the road was
a wagon trail. However, the presence of intact mission features shows that these
disturbances were restricted to the uppermost deposits.
Road Maintenance, Soil Disturbance, and
Redistribution of Artifacts
Water drainage is a crucial part of road maintenance, and this is especially
true east of Menard, where FM 2092 crosses over the floodprone Holocene terraces of
the San Saba River. Although the original topography has been altered by deflation
of soils due to agriculture, the road was probably placed on a natural rise, perhaps
a levee associated with Harris Hollow. It is logical to assume that the ditch on the
north side of FM 2092 has been regularly maintained since the road was built in
1954, and this is probably true for the pre-1954 county road as well.
Typical rural road maintenance usually entails grading the ditch with a
maintainer, backhoe, or other machine that pushes the fill upward from the bottom
of the ditch toward the outer edge, forming a berm along the fence at the edge of the
right of way. At the mission site, the borrow ditch fill included some gravels, some
of which occur naturally in the sediment and others that were imported for the old
county gravel road or as road base gravels for FM 2092. Constant grading of the
borrow ditch and subsequent erosion then redeposited these gravelly sediments
along the fence lines. Mission-related artifacts contained in these sediments also
were moved. This probably is especially true for materials from excavations closest
to the borrow ditch, i.e., the units in Rows B and C. This process likely explains how
some artifacts from the Spanish occupation were moved from their original locations
to become redeposited at higher elevations, thus accounting for the occurrence of
mission artifacts above the level of the ash lens (Feature 13) and the concentrations
of burned daub.
DISTRIBUTION OF FEATURES
Figure 12.1 shows that the ash lens (Feature 13) clearly defines the 1758
mission-burning event at roughly 98.95–99.05 m over most of the site (see Figures
11.5 and 11.6 and Table 11.4). The elevations vary somewhat, most likely due to
natural undulations of the old ground surface. The ash layer is discontinuous,
representing only the remnants of those areas that got burned, buried quickly, and
happened to survive for more than 250 years. The ash layer probably survived well
in selected areas because it was trapped below other debris, such as under partially
burned wall sections that collapsed. The ash lens serves as a key stratigraphic
marker, with the 1758 ground surface being at or just below it.

275

276

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Two pit features (Features 7 and 11), four postholes (Features 1, 4, 6, and
9), and a bone concentration (Feature 10) date to the Spanish occupation. All occur
below the Feature 13 ash lens. The features are in clusters. Posthole Features 1, 4,
and 6 and sections of the ash lens are clustered 19–30 m west of the monument.
There is a sizable gap where no features were found between 9 and 19 m. A second
cluster is 2–9 m west of the monument, and it contains sections of the ash lens,
posthole Feature 9, bone cluster Feature 10, and two soil stains (Features 7 and 11).
Another gap is in the vicinity of the monument, and then the Feature 17 artifact
concentration is 4–15 m east of the monument. These features represent a critical
area along the southern edge of the mission compound.
DISTRIBUTION OF SPANISH ARTIFACTS
AND BURNED DAUB
With few exceptions, the Spanish colonial artifacts were found below the
Feature 13 ash lens (Figure 12.2). Artifacts of known Spanish origin occur primarily
between 99.00 and 98.80 m, although some were found higher and lower. The
lowest ones were found at 98.60 m in the artifact concentration (Feature 17) east
of the monument. The vertical distribution of lead artifacts (n = 20) is especially
tight. All were found from 99.00 to 98.80 m, mostly between 5 and 19 m west of
the monument (Table 12.1). One small group (n = 3) was in Unit AE10 east of the
monument (associated with Feature 17), but the densest concentration (n = 15) was
in Units AW15 and AW16.

The distribution of probable Spanish
artifacts supports the interpretation that
they are associated with the colonial
occupation (see Figure 12.2). The iron
chain links (n = 11) primarily are within
the Spanish zone with the exception of two
recovered higher at 99.20–99.10 m. The
single piece of salt-glazed stoneware is
from 99.00–98.90 m in Unit AW22.

Spanish artifacts found above the
ash lens consist of one snipe hinge, two
wrought nails, one wrought spike, six
majolica sherds, three olive jar sherds, one
Native-made ceramic sherd, and one piece of container glass. Probable Spanish
artifacts found above the ash lens are two chain links and one porcelain sherd.
Their distributions are most likely due to mechanical maintenance of the FM 2092
borrow ditch.

Note: Excludes one modern lead specimen from BW12.

The burned daub distribution (Figure 12.3) shows a similar pattern. Most
is from the Spanish occupational zone, with 91 percent being at or below the level
of the Feature 13 ash lens. Only a small amount (9 percent by weight) was found
above it, reflecting postdepositional disturbance. The densest concentrations of daub
are at or above the elevations of the tops of features.

Chapter 12: Analysis and Interpretations of the Archeological Data
The greatest burned daub concentration, in Units AW14–AW22, coincides
with a number of Spanish colonial artifacts above and near posthole Feature 1
(Figure 12.4). Sixteen of the 20 lead artifacts are from this area, and 15 of these
are melted blobs. Lead melts at a temperature easily reached in open fires (621°F),
and the co-occurrence of melted lead and daub indicates that this was the location
of a wattle-and-daub structure where many of the items inside got heated before
the walls collapsed and fell to the ground.
The two other notable concentrations of artifacts are associated with only
moderate to low amounts of burned daub. There is a concentration of artifacts,
features, and daub in Units AW3–AW9, but there are not enough materials to
indicate a structure in this immediate area. The area immediately to the east is
a 5-m-long stretch where no artifacts and very little burned daub were recovered.
The large concentration of artifacts from 5 to 14 m east of the monument
represents a possible trash disposal area (i.e., Feature 17), but the amount of burned
daub is minimal. The daub consists of small fragments widely dispersed by historic
and modern activities, most likely plowing of the agricultural fields. The Feature 17
area may be more extensively disturbed than many other areas.
After weeding out the obviously modern bones, the rest of the animal
bones (n = 715) are grouped as Spanish colonial or probable Spanish colonial. They
are distributed along the entire length of the excavations, from 30 m west of the
historical monument to 14 m east (Figure 12.5). Like the artifacts, the bones are
dispersed vertically more than 40 cm, with some above the ash lens and some below
it. There are two notable concentrations. One is associated with the probable trash
disposal area designated as Feature 17; there are more than 300 bones in the 14
units containing this feature. Within this feature, Units AE9–AE12 contain the vast
majority of the bones (n = 285). Two of these units (AE9 and AE10) also contain
most of the mission-related artifacts within Feature 17 (see Figure 12.2).
The other significant concentration is the assemblage of bones from Feature
10, which also produced a Perdiz arrow point and a strike-a-light flint. Feature 10
appears to represent a dump of animal bones that were butchered and presumably
eaten by people at the mission. There is little doubt that Feature 10 is a mission
deposit because one probable sheep or goat bone and two domestic cattle bones were
recovered, and some several specimens have butchering marks made by metal knife
blades or large chopping blades (see Table 9.3). Other animals represented in the
Feature 10 assemblage are deer and fish, but most are unidentifiable medium to
large mammal and large artiodactyl remains.
DISTRIBUTION AND HEAT ALTERATION OF
NATIVE AMERICAN LITHICS
This section presents data on the vertical and horizontal distributions of lithic
artifacts with evidence of intensive heating. The data were analyzed to determine if
some of the lithic materials might have been lying on the ground surface and gotten
burned during the mission attack. If concentrations of burned lithic materials could
be recognized, then the burned and unburned lithics within those concentrations

283

284

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
could represent artifacts deposited by Indians who visited the mission in the months
just prior to the attack.
Table 12.2 summarizes the evidence of heating of the unmodified debitage
by excavation unit. The intensively heated debitage is most informative because it
probably reflects accidental heating rather than intentional heat treatment. None of
the recovered stone tools were intensively heated (acknowledging that it is possible
that intensively heated stone tools were destroyed and rendered recognizable only as
debitage). The percentage of intensively heated specimens out of the total unmodified
debitage is shown for each unit. The amount of intensively heated debitage ranges
from 0 to 50 percent for all the excavation units, but for units yielding more than
10 flakes, it is 0 to 39 percent.
Table 12.3 and Figure 12.6 summarize the evidence for heating of unmodified
debitage by elevation. Eighty percent of all the unmodified debitage (480 of 603)
occurs within the elevations of 99.10 to 98.80 m, and the frequency of intensively
heated specimens is highest within these levels. Of the 103 intensively heated
flakes recovered, 85.4 percent (n = 88) are in this same elevation range, which also
is where the majority of the artifacts and the largest concentrations of burned daub
occur. Of the 480 flakes in the three levels that make up the Spanish occupation
zone, 18.3 percent are intensively heated. In addition, 24.2 percent of the unmodified
debitage found above 99.10 m is intensively heated, and this may represent mission
occupation materials in the plow zone. In contrast, only 8.8 percent of the debitage
found below 98.80 m is intensively heated. The distribution remains similar when
all of the heated debitage (including minimally and intensively heated) is examined.
The data presented in Table 12.3 and Figure 12.6 suggest a strong stratigraphic
relationship between the mission occupation zone and the occurrence of unmodified
debitage and heated flakes.
Figure 12.7 shows the horizontal distributions of unburned, minimally
heated, and intensively heated debitage compared to burned daub and charred wood.
The heated flakes are mostly in the same general locations as the concentrations of
daub and the highest frequencies of burned wood. A concentration of heated flakes
is in Feature 17 in the eastern end of the excavation area, and there is a light but
continuous scatter of heated flakes where the burned daub is most concentrated
west of the monument. Charred wood seems to follow this same pattern. These
correlations suggest that most of the heated flakes are associated with burning of
the mission.
An interpretation that many chert flakes were heated during burning of
the mission does not necessarily mean that these flakes were associated with the
mission occupation. In fact, it only means that the flakes were present on the ground
surface when the mission was burned. While some of flakes could been generated
by mission inhabitants, most of them may represent lithic reduction that occurred
some time before the mission was built. The presence of unheated flakes in the same
contexts as heated flakes suggests that some were in close proximity to sizable pieces
of burning wood or brush, while most were not.

Figure 12.6. Graph of intensively heated debitage vs. unheated and minimally heated debitage by elevation.

One other possible source of heating should be mentioned. When the Spanish
came to the site in 1757, their first task would have been to clear the trees and
brush over a large area where they intended to build the mission. They would
have selected all sizable tree trunks and branches for use in building the mission
structures, but they may have disposed of unwanted materials by creating brush
piles and burning them. Such activities could have contributed to the intensively
heated flakes found at the mission site.
WHO MADE THE NATIVE AMERICAN
LITHIC ARTIFACTS?
The lithic analysis in Chapter 8 attempted to tease apart the assemblage
of chipped stone tools and debitage in an effort to address the question of who
made the Native American lithics recovered. In the analysis, Dockall examined
the horizontal and vertical distributions of the debitage and tools and looked for
attribute patterns that might help separate the lithic materials into subsets made
by specific groups of people at specific times. The analysis was not successful due
to factors related to geomorphology and site history. Over the last millennium,
the mission site experienced a series of occupation and use episodes on a very
stable Holocene alluvial terrace, and the deposits were subject to a great deal of
postdepositional mixing. Dockall concluded that the assemblage probably reflects a
mixture of mission-period materials, earlier protohistoric and prehistoric materials,
and later historic materials. The ultimate conclusion is that it is impossible to
determine how much of the assemblage, and which parts of it, are associated with
the mission occupation.

287

288

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
At least 10 groups or or situations could have contributed to the assemblage.
First, prehistoric Native Americans may have occupied the area. This could include
occupations during the Late Archaic period (perhaps explaining the two dart points
found), the Austin phase, and especially the Toyah phase. These groups certainly
used stone tools and could have left them and the associated debitage at the location
where the Spanish eventually built the mission. A prehistoric Toyah phase occupation
is documented at the Fivemile Crossing site (41MN55) only 1.6 miles east of the
mission site.
Second, various Native Americans, perhaps Toyah peoples but possibly other
nomadic groups who frequented central Texas between the mid sixteenth and mid
eighteenth centuries, could have occupied the area in the pre-mission period (e.g.,
Wade 2003:216–223). If so, they likely used stone tools and discarded them there.
Third, a large band of Apache lived in the area when the Spanish arrived to
establish the mission, and they may have left artifacts there. In 1732, the Apache
suffered a severe defeat on the San Saba River by Spaniards led by Governor
Bustillo y Zevallos (Dunn 1912:187). Father Aranda visited 58 Apache and their
captain on the San Saba River in 1753 (Wade 2003:179). During the 1753 Galván
expedition, the Spanish camped at or in the vicinity while conducting the initial
reconnaissance to select a mission site (Castañeda 1936:371–372; Dunn 1914:383).
The Therán expedition (Castañeda 1936:371–372; Dunn 1914:383) camped at the
site in 1755. The Apache could have camped with them to show their support for
the proposed mission. On January 25, 1753, Therán found 467 Apache with their
leader, Chiquito, on their way to the San Saba River to a place where the spring
waters ran westward (Wade 2003:180).
Fourth, between 1753 and 1757 the Lipan Apache camped in the Apache
homeland on the San Saba River (Maestas 2003:282), in what Hunter (1905, 1935)
called their “Summerland.” They did this in anticipation of a mission being built at
the site selected by Galván and Therán.
Fifth, various bands of Apache are reported to have stopped briefly at the
mission between April 1757 and March 1758 (e.g., Castañeda 1936:398; Dunn
1914:398–402; Wade 2007:180–182, 188–190). An estimated 3,000 Lipan Apache
with “Chiefs” Chico and Casablanca57 camped in the vicinity in mid June 1757
(Castañeda 1936:389; Dunn 1914:398–400; Wade 2003:187, 2007:188–190; Weddle
1964:57). There are some discrepancies in the interpretations of the Spanish
documents, but the large camp of Lipan Apache appears to have been near Presidio
San Sabá rather than at the mission (Wade 2007:180–181; 190). However, some
of these Native peoples may have visited or camped near the mission. The Lipan
Apache may have included any of the eastern Apache peoples identified by Nathan
and Simpson (2000:xv) as Lipan, Natáge, and Mescalero.
Sixth, between 17 and 40 people (depending on the source) lived at the
mission (Dunn 1914:404; Hindes et al. 1995:6, Table 2:9; Wade 2006:NS doc.
#23), including the Spanish missionaries, soldiers, and several families of Native
Americans. Castañeda (1936:400) states that there were “eight or ten faithful
57

Casablanca also appears as Casaca Blanca in original Spanish documents.

Tlaxcalteca families, and a few Indian servants.” These people were neophytes
(recently converted Native peoples) identified as Tlaxcaltecan Indians from Saltillo,
Mexico (Castañeda 1936:394–397; Dunn 1914:391). Weddle (1964:70) states that
there were “four San Antonio Mission Indians and their wives” just prior to the
massacre, as well as 2 to 4 Apache at the time of the massacre. These Native peoples
would have known how to knap flint and could have procured local cherts to make
their own tools.
Seventh, Spanish records indicate that one to three old or ill Lipan Apache
Indians stayed at the mission during the 11-month occupation. At least one elderly
Apache died and was buried there (Wade 2007:195; Weddle 1965:30). Weddle
(1964:70) states that there were “two Apache Indians” there just prior to the
massacre, while Maestas (2003:272) states that four were present. These people
may have made and used some stone tools during their stay at the mission.
Eighth, although chipped stone tools and debitage found at Spanish missions
are typically thought of as having been made by Natives, the Spanish inhabitants
were as potential makers of stone tools as well. Being in a remote corner of the
northern frontier, the they did not have access to all the supplies and tools they
needed. Many of the Spaniards regularly went back and forth between the mission
and presidio, and they may have found it prudent to make, use, and maintain chipped
stone tools. For example, Spanish soldiers may have made their own gunflints and
other expedient cutting and scraping tools. In addition, Spanish soldiers often
married mission Indians who may have engaged in making and maintaining stone
tools.
Ninth, the natives who attacked and destroyed the mission, who the Spanish
later called Norteños, were primarily Comanche and Tejas or Wichita but also
included other peoples identified as Tanague, Vidae, Yojuane (Yujuane) “and many
other nations” (Dunn 1914:405–406; Nathan and Simpson 2000:59, 66, 69, 74, 82).
These Indians were only at the mission from about sunrise to nightfall on one day
(Dunn 1914:404; Wade 2007:207), but there were many of them. Estimates vary
from 400 to 2,000 (Dunn 1914:406, see n. 7). The Norteños brought some of the lead
artifacts that were recovered from the mission (as demonstrated by the geochemical
study in Chapter 6), and it is possible that they deposited lithic artifacts as well.
They killed all of the mission’s livestock, and butchered and ate some of the animals.
Thus, it is possible that they may have even brought or made expedient tools that
were discarded near the butchered animals.
Tenth, there is no record of Native Americans coming back to the site of the
destroyed mission to camp, but this certainly could have happened. The presidio was
occupied for more than a dozen years after the mission was destroyed, but once it
was finally abandoned in 1772, there was little doubt that the San Saba River region
had become Comanche territory. It is doubtful that the Apache would have returned
to camp at the mission site after the presidio was gone. On the other hand, it seems
likely that the Comanche, and perhaps their Tejas allies, would have returned to
visit and reminisce, if nothing else.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
WHO MADE THE BONE-TEMPERED
POTTERY AND PERDIZ POINT?
The bone-tempered pottery and Perdiz arrow point found are of particular
interest from a social identity perspective. Both are typically associated with the
Toyah phase in central Texas, which was once thought to be limited to the prehistoric
period (Johnson 1994:237, 239). Arnn (2012:64–65), Jelks (1962:99), and Johnson
(1994:237, 239) raised the possibility that the Toyah culture could have survived
into historic times. While some Toyah sites have yielded date ranges that extend
into protohistoric and historic times (e.g., Hester and Hill 1975:19; Treece et al.
1993:399–401), radiocarbon assays from the last few hundred years are not precise
enough to provide much solid evidence. European artifacts have not been found in
indisputable direct association with Toyah artifacts—i.e., from contexts known to be
pristine and not potentially mixed with earlier materials—but there is circumstantial
evidence that Toyah materials survived into historic times.
Sherds of bone-tempered plainware were found at Mission San Sabá, and
they occur along with many Spanish artifacts in the mission occupation zone in Unit
AW18 (99.10–99.00 m), Unit BW19 (98.90–98.80 m), and Unit BW11 (99.10–99.00
m). But from their contexts alone, it is not certain that these sherds are associated
with the Spanish occupation.
There is considerable evidence that the bone-tempered pottery tradition,
which covered central and south Texas in the latter part of the Late Prehistoric
period, survived well into the protohistoric and historic periods. But just how long
into the historic period it survived has not yet been determined. Its presence is well
documented at Spanish missions in Texas, where it is often called Goliad Ware. Goliad
Ware is one of the most common ceramic types found on many Spanish colonial sites
from San Antonio south and west into coastal Texas (Fox and Tomka 2006:81; Walter
2007:87). Bone-tempered plainwares are reported, for example, at Mission Espíritu
Santo, 41GD1 (Ulrich et al. 2005:46–50); the visita (temporary location) of Mission
Espíritu Santo, 41VT10 (Hindes et al. 1999:86–88); the second or third location of
Mission Espíritu Santo, 41VT11 (Walter 1999:110; 2007:85–88); the second location
of Presidio La Bahía, 41VT8 (Fox and Tomka 2006:81); Nuestra Señora del Refugio,
41RF1 (Tennis 2002:234–235); and four missions in San Antonio—San Antonio de
Valero, San José, San Juan, and Concepción (see discussion of Leon Plain ceramics
in San Antonio missions by Clark 1978:76–77).
Archeologists attribute its production to mission Indians who came from
central and south Texas groups who made bone-tempered pottery, as well as the
general spread of the bone-tempered pottery tradition. In a discussion of prehistoric
pottery from south Texas, Black (1982:452–453) suggests that bone-tempered pottery
found in many seventeenth- and eighteenth-century missions around Texas is the
continuation of a single widespread prehistoric ceramic tradition into historic times.
Walter (2007:87) echoes this sentiment, stating that “Leon Plain and Goliad ware
probably represent a continuation of the same potter tradition. The differences are
marked only by their contexts in either prehistoric or mission-era deposits.” Clark
(1978:77) attributes the bone-tempered pottery in the San Antonio missions to the
“Lipan Apache-Coahuiltecan complex.”

Chapter 12: Analysis and Interpretations of the Archeological Data
It is almost certain that the bone-tempered sherds found in the PAI
excavations were associated with the 1757–1758 mission occupation.58 The
Spaniards and neophyte Indians (i.e., the Tlaxcaltecans) who established the
mission could have brought the pottery with them, perhaps having obtained it
from one of the San Antonio missions. Or the Indians could have made the pottery,
perhaps having learned bone tempering and other pottery-making techniques
from other Native peoples at the San Antonio missions. Or the pottery could have
been brought by one of the Native American groups, reportedly Apache peoples,
who visited the mission.
One piece of evidence suggests that the pottery may be associated with
the Spaniards or mission Indians rather than Apache. Unlike the bone-tempered
pottery at Mission San Sabá, the Native-made pottery found at Mission San
Lorenzo is a dark gray, sand-tempered plainware that Tunnell and Newcomb
(1969:41, Figure 39D) attribute to the Lipan Apache who lived there during its
nine-year span from 1762 to 1771 (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969:165–176). The
fact that not a single sherd of bone-tempered pottery was found at San Lorenzo
would seem to indicate that the Lipan Apache had their own distinctive ceramic
tradition and did not make any bone-tempered pottery. Some additional evidence
for interpreting the origin of the bone-tempered pottery sherds found at Mission
San Sabá comes from the geochemical sourcing study using instrumental neutron
activation analysis (discussed below).
The nearly complete Perdiz arrow point (see Figure 5.14) that was found in
the Feature 10 bone concentration remains somewhat of a mystery. It is spatially
associated with broken, burned, and butchered animal bones, including elements
from historic cattle and probable sheep or goat (see Table 11.5). Feature 10 most
likely represents a dump of debris along the edge of the mission or near a jacal or
wattle-and-daub structure. How the point came to be at the mission in this context
is not clear, but six scenarios should be considered: (1) although the Feature 10 bone
cluster is fairly discrete, it is possible that the point is an earlier item introduced
by postdepositional disturbance; (2) the point might have belonged to one of the
Native American neophytes who lived at the mission (which included Tlaxcaltecan
Indians from Mexico and some Texas Indians, perhaps including Apache or Jumanos,
from the San Antonio missions) and been used to kill one of the animals and then
discarded or lost along with the butchered and burned animal bones; (3) a member
of one of the visiting Apache bands might have deposited the point, in which case
the point might have been used to kill one of the animals, perhaps a cow or sheep
that was given to the Indians by the missionaries; (4) a Spaniard or a mission Indian
could have picked up the point as a curiosity from a nearby Toyah campsite; (5) it
is possible that the point was used and deposited by one of the attacking Indians
on March 16, 1758, in which case it could have been used to kill one of the mission
animals and then discarded or lost with the remains of feasting; and (6) it is possible
that the point was deposited by a Native American who visited the site after the
mission was destroyed.
It is also possible, but again rather unlikely, that the pottery was introduced by the Norteños
during the mission attack. Juan Leal, a survivor of the mission attack, stated that “The Indians
brought ammunition in big jars” (Nathan and Simpson 2000).
58

293

294

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
The first and last scenarios are least likely. Three facts provide a strong
indication that the point is associated with or was deposited during the mission
period. First, it was the only Perdiz point found, and no fragments of arrow points,
scrapers, knives, or other tools typically associated with Toyah phase were recovered.
Second, the point was spatially associated (vertically and horizontally) with the
Feature 10 bone cluster, which includes historic cattle bones. Third, it was found
along with burned daub and at least one other Spanish artifact (a strike-a-light)
below an intact section of the Feature 13 ash lens (see Figures 12.2–12.4). This
suggests that Feature 10 is not significantly disturbed and that the association
between the Perdiz point and the animal bones is strong.
The fifth scenario is somewhat unlikely because Feature 10 occurs below the
intact ash lens. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the deposition of the point and
the bones occurred before the mission burned. If the bones were deposited there on
the day of the attack, it is likely that more of them would have been burned.
The remaining scenarios, all of which posit that the Perdiz point was
deposited where it was found during the mission occupation period, are all equally
plausible. All are interesting with respect to understanding social identity. For
example, under the third scenario, the Perdiz arrow point would have belonged to
an Apache Indian visiting the mission. Perdiz points were used by prehistoric Toyah
phase peoples, a large social field that probably included the historic Jumanos (e.g.,
Hickerson 1994:220–230; Johnson 1994:279–280; Kenmotsu 2001:34-37; Mallouf
1987:66; Newcomb 1961:134–135; Suhm 1957:56, 1960:85; Wade 2003:216–223).
Because the Jumanos were enemies of the Apache, one might argue against this
scenario on the grounds that a Perdiz point would probably not be found among
the Apache peoples who came to the mission. Native peoples in Texas experienced
dramatic changes throughout the eighteenth century under a variety of different
pressures, however. Kenmotsu (2001:35) notes that:
…the arrival of the Comanche increased the southward movement
of the Apaches. In light of these factors, the Jumanos appear to
have been forced to reconcile themselves with their former enemy,
and the phase ‘Apaches Jumanos’ surfaced in selected documents,
indicating that the Jumanos had joined their former enemy, yet
again redefining themselves to persist.
The once-numerous Jumanos had largely disappeared as a distinct social group
by the mid-1700s, and it appears that many Jumano bands simply joined with the
Apache by this time. Kenmotsu (2001:34) states that: “Faced with the limited options,
the documentary evidence indicates that the Jumanos bowed to the inevitable: they
became their enemy, the Apache.” If this is true, perhaps it would not be surprising to
find a Perdiz arrow point left by one of the Apache Indians who visited the mission.
WHERE WAS THE POTTERY MADE AND WHO MADE IT?
The questions of who made the pottery found at Mission San Sabá and
where it was made touch on many aspects of Spanish colonial research in the New
World. It has been established that some ceramics made in Europe and Spain were
brought to missions in the New World, some were made in various parts of Mexico

Chapter 12: Analysis and Interpretations of the Archeological Data
and distributed widely across the Spanish empire, and still others were made at
some of the Spanish missions in Texas. The petrographic study and geochemical
study using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) looked at these
questions.
The Petrographic Study
The petrographic analysis conducted by David Robinson (see Appendix
G) consisted of 17 Native-made plainware sherds from three sites: Presidio San
Sabá (5 sherds), Mission San Sabá (7 sherds), and the Fivemile Crossing site (5
sherds). The latter is an undated Toyah phase occupation adjacent to the San
Saba River downstream and 1.3 miles east of the mission (Boyd and Mehalchick
2017; McWilliams and Boyd 2008:37, 48). The petrographic study presents detailed
characterizations of the nonplastic constituents in these plainwares. The data
clearly show that the Toyah bone-tempered sherds are quite different from the
bone-tempered plainwares from the mission and presidio. The mission and presidio
sherds are similar overall and match the thick varieties of mission-made Goliad
plainware. But there are significant chemical differences in the INAA data. The
five presidio sherds are distinctive from six of the seven mission sherds, and the
seventh mission sherd is distinctive from all the rest and contains no bone temper
at all.
The INAA Study
A sample of Spanish colonial pottery was analyzed using INAA. The results
are reported by Ferguson and Glascock in Appendix F. PAI submitted 34 ceramic
samples, 2 burned daub samples, and 1 natural clay sample from 3 sites in Menard
County: Mission San Sabá, Presidio San Sabá, and the the Fivemile Crossing site.
These samples included 17 Native-made plainwares and 17 colonial wares classified
as Mexican-made redware or red-slipped ware (n = 2), majolica (n = 9), olive jar
(n = 5), and salt-glazed stoneware (n = 1). The data were compared to 289 other
ceramic samples from Spanish colonial sites in the INAA database. Excluding 6
burned daub and natural clay samples, the total ceramic sample is 321 sherds from
11 sites: Mission San Francisco de la Espada (41BX4); Mission San Juan Capistrano
(41BX5); Mission Nuestra Señora del Rosario (41GD2); Presidio el Fuerte de Santa
Cruz del Cibolo (41KA26-B); Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas (41MN1); Mission
Santa Cruz de San Sabá (41MN23); Fivemile Crossing site (41MN55); Mission San
Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz (41RE1); Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio (41RF1);
Mission Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los Ais (41SA25); and Rancho de las
Cabras (41WN30). Ten are missions, presidios, and a rancho, and 1 is a Toyah
phase occupation (presumably prehistoric) downstream from Mission San Sabá.
The INAA study sorted 243 of the 321 ceramic sherds into 21 chemical groups as
shown in Table 12.4.
The sample of sherds is small overall, and the sites constitute a poor sample
of the total universe of Spanish colonial sites in Texas. But the chemical group
assignments are intriguing, and the samples from the mission and presidio at San
Sabá provide some insights into the Spanish mission network in Texas.

Native-Made Plainwares
Six of the 7 plainware sherds from Mission San Sabá are assigned to a
chemical group, and they are all in Group 19. They do not match any other sherds
in the sample, so we have no idea where they were manufactured. Only 1 of the 5
plainware sherds from Presidio San Sabá is assigned to a chemical group, and it is
in Group 16 along with 23 sherds from the Refugio mission. These specimens likely
came from a common source area at one of the Texas missions, perhaps Refugio.
Lead-Glazed Earthenware
The INAA sample does not include any lead-glazed earthenware sherds
from Mission San Sabá (none were found) or Presidio San Sabá. The 82 sherds
from five other mission sites are classified into nine chemical groups. Some groups
have only 1 to 5 sherds from a single mission, while one group has 42 sherds from
four missions. Two of the chemical groups (Groups 4 and 20) show an overlap with
sherds classified as Native plainwares, which may mean that these plainwares and
lead-glazed wares are the same except for the finish. Group 2 overlaps with the
redwares (see below).
Redware or Red-Slipped Ware
The two sherds of redware or red-slipped ware from Mission San Sabá are
in chemical Group 2, which includes redware sherds from three other missions: San
Juan (n = 3); Refugio (n = 8), and Dolores (n = 2). This group also includes sherds
called lead-glazed earthenwares from Mission Refugio (n = 6), Mission San Lorenzo
(n = 4), and Mission Dolores (n = 2). The fact that a large number of lead-glazed and
red-slipped wares are in this one chemical group suggests that the clay bodies are
identical, and only the ceramic finishes are different. It is likely that the difference
between the lead-glazed and red-slipped finishes is related to different vessel forms
and functions.
Majolica
Only nine sherds of majolica (tin-glazed ware) are in the INAA sample, and
all of them are from Mission San Sabá and represent at least three different vessels.
All nine are in a single chemical group (Group 6) that contains no other sherds.
Thus, it appears that the majolica sherds are from a single manufacturing source,
perhaps Puebla, Mexico (Fox and Ulrich 2008:98–103).
Olive Jar
Only five olive jar sherds are in the INAA sample, and they are all from
Mission San Sabá. These sherds are in two chemical groups—three in Group 8 and
two in Group 12. This chemical distinction confirms the visual analysis that divided
these sherds into Type 1 and Type 2 olive jar wares. Group 8 also contains two
sherds of lead-glazed earthenware from Mission Dolores, and Group 12 also contains
one sherd of lead-glazed earthenware from Mission Dolores. Olive jars typically
have lead glaze on the interior, but they are distinguished from other lead-glazed

Chapter 12: Analysis and Interpretations of the Archeological Data
earthenwares because of their vessel forms, being thick-bodied “heavy egg-shaped
jars with restricted necks” used to carry liquids such as wine and olive oil from
Spain to the New World (Fox and Ulrich 2008:64). This chemical overlap seems to
indicate that these few sherds from Mission Dolores may actually be from olive jars.
Salt-Glazed Stoneware
The INAA sample includes only one salt-glazed stoneware sherd, and it is
from Mission San Sabá. This specimen is from a finely made small vessel, probably
a cup. It may be an eighteenth-century English-made white salt-glazed ware.
The sherd could not be assigned to any chemical group, and the database has no
European-made salt-glazed ceramics for comparison.
Ceramic Sourcing Conclusions
Acknowledging the sample size issues, the INAA data summarized here is
an important step toward unraveling some of the mysteries regarding the pottery
found at Spanish colonial sites in Texas. The ideas offered above are preliminary
interpretations that cannot be proven without a much larger sample. Geochemical
sourcing using INAA could provide important data for examining the communication
network that connected all of the colonial missions, presidios, and ranchos in Mexico
and Texas.
In 2013 (after the draft of this report was produced), archeologists invoved
in geochemical sourcing studies of Texas ceramics published two important articles.
Creel and his colleagues published results of a large study involving INAA of 600
ceramic samples from Late Prehistoric and early Historic Toyah phase huntergatherer sites in central Texas (Creel et al. 2013). This study included plainware
pottery called Leon Plain, Doss Redware, and Goliad Plain, along with a variety of
imported Caddo ceramics. Tomka and his colleagues published a study of Nativemade historic ceramics in Texas, combining three complementary forms of data
analysis—technological, petrographic, and INAA (Tomka et al. 2013). Both of these
studies provide many important interpretations and insights relating to social
identity, mobility, and interactions of Late Prehistoric and early Historic groups in
central Texas.
IMPLICATIONS OF THE SPATIAL PATTERNS:
WHAT PORTION OF THE MISSION WAS IN
THE FM 2092 RIGHT OF WAY?
The general elevation range for the Spanish occupation was established
based on artifact distributions and a corresponding ash lens (Feature 13) that
was found sporadically across the excavation area. The Spanish occupation zone
is at elevations of 99.10–99.80 m. Most of the artifacts probably were deposited on
a single surface, but they have become dispersed by cracking in the clay vertisol,
bioturbation, historic and modern agricultural activities, and road construction.
The spatial patterning of the features and artifacts presents some interpretive
possibilities. Comparing the distributions of burned daub, mission-period features,

299

300

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
artifacts, and faunal remains is particularly revealing (see Figures 12.1–12.5). The
combined data appear to represent evidence of structures and extramural areas.
The concentration of burned daub and artifacts, along with two postholes, in Units
AW14 to AW22 may represent a portion of a burned wattle-and-daub structure.
This interpretation is enhanced by the fact that many of the artifacts within this
area, such as the melted lead items, are burned and may reflect items that were
stored in the structure. The cluster of features (postholes and bone concentration)
and artifacts in Units AW3 to AW8 is associated with a moderate amount of burned
daub. This location may be an extramural area where trash dumping and other
activities occurred outside of, but close to, a structure. An alternative interpretation
is that this location could represent the edge of a structure that was not burned as
intensively as the area to the west.
Feature 17 encompasses a moderate concentration of daub. It spans a
distance of 10 m horizontally and 50 cm vertically, from 99.10 to 98.60 m. Some
of the Spanish artifacts are somewhat higher here and extend above the ash lens,
and the upper deposits in this area are more disturbed. This inference is supported
by the fact that no soil staining or feature boundaries could be identified within
the large artifact concentration. In all likelihood, Feature 17 represents an artifact
dump located close to a wattle-and-daub structure that burned somewhere along
the mission’s southern stockade wall.
Given the concentrations of burned daub, burned and unburned Spanish
artifacts, and mission-period features, it is likely that the archeological remains
represent the southern edge of an east-west line of structures close to or along
the mission’s southern stockade wall. This interpretation is supported by the fact
that the excavations are located just south of where a line of mission structures is
hypothesized based on the TTU investigations (see Figures 4.7 and 11.5; CavallinCosma 2000:Figures 5.1­5.4; Hindes et al. 1995:65).
A fuller reconstruction of what portion of the mission compound is
represented by the strip of archeological evidence in the FM 2092 right of way must
await completion of the TTU data analysis and reporting. However, a preliminary
discussion of this is warranted based on a comparison of the PAIs excavation data and
archival evidence. In addition to the wealth of data gleaned from written documents,
the Destruction of Mission San Sabá painting is also considered a historic document
and was used to help interpret the archeological data. Using the archeological and
historical evidence, the following spatial interpretations are suggested:
•

The PAI excavations are along the south edge of the mission compound,
in an area where the stockade wall and several wattle-and-daub
structures were present;

•

The mission compound may have been an elongated rectangle rather
than a square, and the eastern portion probably was an open plaza or
courtyard without any structures;

Chapter 12: Analysis and Interpretations of the Archeological Data
•

One of the mission’s gates, perhaps the main gate opening toward the
road to the presidio, may have been somewhere 5–20 m east of the
historical monument, along the fence line and possibly extending into
the FM 2092 right of way. This is just east of where TTU found the
easternmost evidence of wattle-and-daub structures, in the vicinity of a
large Spanish colonial trash midden found by PAI (Feature 17);

If the interpretations above are correct, then archeological investigations
are lacking in a critical area. The 1994 and 1997 investigations by TTU and the
2006–2007 investigations by PAI may have exposed much of the western half of the
mission compound but not the eastern part. The south, west, and possibly north
stockade walls appear to be fairly well delineated by the archeological evidence in
the Lyckman’s alfalfa field and the FM 2092 right of way. But the location of the
eastern stockade wall is not known, and it could be beyond any of the archeological
excavations. TTU and PAI investigators terminated the excavations going eastward
because few Spanish artifacts were found and the ground surface was dropping in
elevation as it sloped down toward the old spring. This led researchers to believe that
postdepositional factors—primarily agricultural plowing and subsequent deflation
and erosion—had removed most or all of the Spanish colonial deposits. But our
interpretation of the 1760s Destruction painting (see Chapter 13) suggests that
few artifacts should be expected in the eastern third of the mission compound. So,
it is not surprising that TTU’s systematic metal detector survey (see Hindes et al.
1995:Figure 4) found few artifacts there. The archeological visibility of the eastern
part of the mission might be limited to the postholes along the stockade fence. The
painting suggests that the east stockade wall probably be between 40 and 60 m
east of the historical monument.

CHAPTER 13: THE DESTRUCTION OF MISSION
SAN SABÁ PAINTING
Douglas K. Boyd and Jennifer K. McWilliams

The figures of two Franciscan priests dominate the edges of the painting,
their long grayish-brown robes dripping with blood and weapons piercing their
bodies. Beyond, a vast scene of destruction unfolds. Indians swarm outside and inside
a compound’s protective stockade, burning and looting buildings inside; Spanish
inhabitants struggle with their attackers; in the far background, tiny figures flee
into the hills. The eighteenth-century painting Destruction of the Mission San Saba,
painted several years after the actual event, depicts the 1758 attack that destroyed
the mission and martyred two of the priests (Figure 13.1).
The painting is a work of art as well as an important piece of Texas history.
Historian Donald Chipman (1992:Figure 23 caption) calls it “the most significant
artistic representation of an event in Spanish Texas.” In his book on Texas’s historical
paintings, Sam Ratcliffe (1991:509) writes that “The Destruction of Mission San
Sabá is the earliest extant easel painting by a professional artist depicting an event
in Texas history.”
If the painting is historically accurate, it would greatly enhance the
archeological interpretation of the mission site. But how accurate is it? To what
extent does it depict the events of the attack? How accurately are the landscape,
the mission compound layout, and the architecture of the buildings depicted? This
chapter explores those questions using a variety of methods, from presenting a
contextual analysis to comparing the events and details depicted with written
documents, primarily eyewitness testimonials recorded by Colonel Ortiz Parrilla
in a series of formal depositions made soon after the attack (Nathan and Simpson
2000).
Many of the ideas presented in this chapter are those of McWilliams, but
they evolved over many years of collaboration and discussions with historical
archeologists Dr. Grant Hall, Kay Hindes, and Mark Wolf. They participated in
the Texas Tech University (TTU) excavations in 1993–1994 (Hindes et al. 1995)
and 1997 (still unpublished), and they have all spent much time examining the
translated Spanish documents and the painting. Their firsthand experience,
intimate knowledge, and unique perspectives are greatly appreciated. In this
chapter, this group and the authors are collectively referred to as the San Sabá
researchers.
This assessment also considers the views of art historians Ratcliffe (1991,
1992), White (2000), and Stoessner (1982). McWilliams also benefited from several

informal conversations with Dr. Sam Ratcliffe (personal communication 2010) and
Dr. Mariah Wade, an expert on the Spanish mission period who recently translated
additional documents pertaining to Mission San Sabá (Wade 2007).
Finally, the authors are cognizant of the critiques of placing too much
emphasis on interpretations of historical paintings (e.g., Galloway 1991; Loren 2007).
In her article about the use of eighteenth-century casta paintings for interpreting
archeological material culture, Loren (2007) suggests caution. Following the lead
of Galloway (1991), she writes:
It is tempting to take such images [casta paintings] at face value,
especially since they depict people using and wearing objects
in specific contexts. Images can be important to archaeological
interpretations: they provide a background for presentations; they
can serve to verify interpretations of the archaeological record; and
they seemingly provide a window to the past. To this end, visual
images are often “mined” for direct references to the archaeological
record. This use warrants some critique. Problems arise when
these images are used for their analogical value without attending
to the production of the image; biases inherent in that image; or
consideration for style, aesthetics, composition, and artistic themes
that influenced their production. (Loren 2007:26)
Loren (2007:27) goes on to suggest that: (1) “analogies are best used comparatively,
rather than illustratively, and points of negative and positive comparison must be
noted”; (2) an important first consideration “is whether the images are relevant
to the archaeological context”; (3) “source criticism plays a role in distinguishing
how images are situated in place and time in relation to the archaeological
and ethnohistorical records”; and (4) “differences between archaeological,
ethnohistorical, and visual sources should be highlighted rather than ignored.”
Keeping these limitations in mind, the authors have attempted to examine and
analyze the Destruction painting holistically and from a variety of perspectives, but
always being aware of the painting’s biases in the context of eighteenth-century
Spanish society.
In any analysis of a graphic document, more eyes are better than a few.
All of the San Sabá researchers have looked at the Destruction painting for many
years, and all have participated in many discussions regarding how much historical
information the painting may, or may not, contain. All agree that we may never know
which details of the mission layout are accurate, and that the painting should be
interpreted judiciously with regard to the physical environment and details of the
presidio and mission. The discussions of the Destruction painting in this chapter
focus on the elements and characteristics that the authors believe are somewhat
accurate, emphasizing points where the archeological and archival records agree
with the painting. But throughout this study, we identify the places where the
archeology and written documents obviously disagree. Building on these inferences,
the authors suggest how the archeologically defined mission compound footprint
may relate to the stockade-enclosed mission depicted in the painting.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
HISTORY OF THE PAINTING
The Destruction painting has been intensively studied, and three art
historians—Ratcliffe (1991, 1992), Stoessner (1982), and White (2000)—have written
at length about the history of the painting and its role in documenting Texas history.
The original 83x115-inch oil painting was commissioned by Spanish mining magnate
Pedro Romero de Terreros, the cousin of the martyred priest and financial sponsor
of the San Sabá mission effort. The painting may have been trimmed at some point,
possibly removing evidence of the painter’s identity and the date (Ratcliffe 1991:517).
The Title
Recent publications (Ratcliffe 1991, 1992; Stoessner 1982; White 2000)
give the painting’s title as The Destruction of Mission San Sabá in the Province
of Texas and the Martyrdom of the Fathers Alonso Giraldo de Terreros, Joséph
Santiesteban. But this appears to be a relatively recent name. Sam Ratcliffe (personal
communication 2011) believes that Texas historian A. C. Greene may have been the
first to call the painting by this name. White (2000:3, footnote 2) also writes that
the title has “varied over the years” and was only recently shorted to Destruction of
the Mission San Sabá. If it was given a formal name at the time of its creation, the
name would likely have referred to the mission by its formal Spanish name—Mission
Santa Cruz de San Sabá—rather than the shortened version. This suggests that
the painting’s original title, if there was one, is long forgotten.
The Date and Artist
Like its name, the precise date is not known. It was certainly painted
after 1758, the year of the mission attack, and before 1767, when a document by
Pedro Terreros refers to it (Ratcliffe 1991:517–119, footnote 24). While Ratcliffe
(1991:Figure 2) gives 1763 as the date of the painting and “circa-1763” in his 1992
publication (Ratcliffe 1992:Plate 5), no contract or other documents have ever been
located to confirm this (Ratcliffe 1991:517). Dorothy Sloan, a rare book dealer in
Austin, offered the original painting for sale in Texas in July 1987 (Sloan 1987). It
had a sale price of $750,000, and was listed (Item No. 228) as follows:
PAEZ, José de (attrib.) Original oil painting on
canvas of the destruction of Mission San Saba in Texas,
measuring approximately 7 x 10-1/2 feet. Mexico, ca. 1760.
Very Fine.
Two years later, Sloan (1989) published a bifold, 11 1/4x9 1/4-inch glossy print
of the painting containing the Spanish transcriptions and the English translations
of the three cartouches in the painting. In this brochure, she lists the author as
unknown but attributes the painting to “circa 1758.” It is unclear why Sloan changed
the date from ca. 1760 to ca. 1758, but there is no definitive evidence to indicate
that the painting was created in 1758, the year that the mission attack occurred.
In the 1990s, during a legal dispute over the cultural patrimony of the painting,
court records stated that it was “painted circa 1758–1762” (White 2000:152, footnote
258). The most recent art history studies suggest it was created in ca. 1763 (Ratcliffe

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
1992:Plate 5) or ca. 1765 (White 2000:Figure 1). For the analysis presented in this
chapter, it is sufficient to know that the painting probably dates to the 1760s and
was created within a few years after the attack.
The question of who painted it centers on a few facts and much conjuncture.
The most popular theory is that José de Páez was the painter. Don Pedro Romero
de Terreros commissioned the painting to commemorate the death of his cousin,
Fray Alonso Giraldo de Terreros, who is depicted on the left side of the painting.
Don Pedro Terreros may have sought and found an artist at Miguel Cabrera’s studio
in Mexico City. Cabrera was “the dominant painter of mid-eighteenth-century
Mexico” and his studio was “the logical place for Terreros to find an artist” (Ratcliffe
1991:519). In the early 1760s, an artist named José de Páez was commissioned to
create a series of paintings depicting the life of the patron saint of the College of San
Fernando, and these paintings were completed in 1764.59 These works resulted in
“Páez being named the official painter of the seminary” (Ratcliffe 1991:520), and he
would have been respected and easily accessible to Don Pedro Terreros in the early
1760s. According to Terreros’s family lore (White 2000:77, n. 127), Father Molina
advised the painter, and Páez and Father Molina may have spent time together at
the College of San Fernando while Molina recovered from his wounds (Ratcliffe
1991:521). Páez moved to Oaxaca soon after 1764 (Ratcliffe 1991:521), physically
separating him from the College of San Fernando and the three people who would
have told him the story depicted in the painting: Cabrera, Terreros, and Molina. Of
these three, Father Molina was the only actual eyewitness, having been a survivor
of the mission attack.
After examining the style, design, and techniques of the paintings of Cabrera
and Páez, White (2000:107) reached the conclusion based on “the visual evidence”
that Páez was the painter. Ratcliffe (1992:11) agrees that this is likely, but states that
the evidence is not conclusive. Hence, the general consensus among art historians
is that Páez probably created the painting while he was in Mexico City in the
early 1760s. The possibility that the edges were trimmed has been mentioned as
an explanation for the lack of an artist’s signature, but at least one other painting
attributed to Páez in 1765 is unsigned (Baer 1993:44, Figure 2).
Perspective, Subject, and Artistic Style
The scene depicted is presented from a bird’s-eye view. From this elevated
perspective, the viewer looks west across the whole mission compound and beyond.
The San Saba River flows from the west, and the presidio is visible in the far
background. The topography is exaggerated, but the overall landscape appears to
be generally accurate.
The subject is, of course, the death of the priests and the events relating to the
attack and destruction of the mission that occurred on March 16, 1758. The painting
was not meant to be a snapshot in time, but rather a depiction of the sequence of
White (2000) gives conflicting dates for when Terreros commissioned the painting and when it
might have been painted. On page 143, he gives “approximately 1768” as the date when Terreros
commissioned the painting, but on page 144 he says it was commissioned “sometime in the 1760’s
.” In the painting’s caption on page 2 (Figure 1), he then gives the date as “ca. 1765.”
59

events that happened over a period of at least 14 hours—and possibly as much as 36
hours—beginning at dawn.60 A timeline of events is spread out across the painting,
and the key events are described in the text presented in the three cartouches at
the bottom (Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1). The sizes of the images have temporal
meaning relating to the events on the day of the attack. The larger images depicted
at the lower right are events that occurred earlier in the day, and the depictions get
smaller as the events unfolded during the day and into the night. The arrival of the
Indians on the morning of March 16 is shown with the largest human and horse
images (lower right; see E in Figure 13.2 [on the ground behind the lead horse’s
foot] and Table 13.1). The final escape of the survivors during the night has some
of the smallest human figures (upper right; see P in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1).
But relative to the depiction of the attack, the images of the two murdered priests
are enormous and frame the action in the middle. The details show how the attack
unfolded, but the focal point is clearly the martyred priests.
Many of the details depicted, such as the specific manner is which the priests
were killed, could only have been known to the survivors. This leaves little doubt that
the artist created the painting based on the written eyewitness testimonies, perhaps
with the assistance of one or more of the survivors. It appears from the details
that the artist’s best informant was Father Molina, either from his comprehensive
written testimony or through personal contact. White (2000:44) believes that the
painter had access to Molina’s testimony or had direct interactions with him, and
that he also had access to the collective San Sabá Papers (as published by Nathan
and Simpson 2000). In his detailed study, White (2000:43–44) writes:
Comparisons with the depositions and letters of the witnesses also
verify the supposition that the painting is an accurate recording of
the events. Following the alphabetized explanation of the painting
is the easiest method of relating it to the recorded oral affidavits by
the survivors of their experiences at the mission. These accounts
include testimony by Juan Leal, the soldier who was left for dead
twice by the Indians; Colonel Parrilla, who witnessed the aftermath
of the massacre and led efforts to recover all the bodies; and Father
Miguel Molina, who escaped although severely wounded. All these
accounts were available as sources for the composition of the work.
As none of the survivors could have known the entire series of
events, it is reasonable to believe that the painting compiles the
eyewitness accounts of more than just one person.
Perhaps the best circumstantial evidence that the painter had direct contact
with one or more of the eyewitnesses to the mission attack is found in the center of
the painting in front of the chapel. The Indians are removing a staff with a banner
painting that appears to be a brightly colored rendition of the Virgin Mary. This
type of banner painting would have been carried in religious processions and used
for religious instruction at the mission (Baer 1993:45), and this particular object is
The timing of certain events, as stated by Father Molina, is confusing. At one point, he testifies
that the group escaped after midnight (i.e., in the early morning hours of March 17), but he later
states that they spent the night in the room and that the soldier Joseph Vásquez came to the
room seeking shelter about eight o’clock in the morning (Nathan and Simpson 2000:88–89). In
contrast, Leal states that they escaped from the mission at 9 p.m. on March 16 (Nathan and
Simpson 2000:75).

For the two Colleges for the Propogation of Faith, that of Santa Cruz de Querétara, and that of San Fernando,
which in 1756 promoted the new reduction [settling into villages of Indians converted to Christianity] and
conquest of the Apache Indians, and in the year 1757 supported the foundation with the fortification of the
Presidio of San Saba on the banks of its river. The promoter was the Reverend Father Fray Alonso Giraldo
de Terreros, aided with nothing less than the applauded determination of the Illustrious Knight don Pedro
Terreros, of the order of Calatrava who, at this own expense, funded all the missions which could be placed
within the new reduction, and who, even after the invasion and the most considerable losses persists in his zeal
for those same Indians. God in your mercy aid this sacred project.
Alphabetical explanation of the events
A. The Presidio of San Saba, its garrison of one hundred soldiers.
B. The road from the Presidio to the Mission.
C. The river that divides the Mission from the Presidio.
D. The Mission, with its stockade, church, and huts.
E. The arrival of the barbarian Indians at the Mission.
F. The Captain General of the Army [of the Indians] advancing at the head of one thousand men.
G. They encircle the Mission.
H. [Father Terreros] goes out to greet them with great love and speaks with them a long time in the company
of Father Fray Miguel Molina; and those barbarians, with fraud and deceit, requested peace and asked the
Father President to go with them to the Presidio.
I. The Father President [Terreros] left with a soldier for the Presidio accompanied by a gang of Indians, who
halted them with weapons in hand when they had only gone a few paces. They shot the Father President
twice in the chest, and fired several other shots at the soldier, knocking both from their horses and onto the
ground, and sending their souls to the Creator. And not having satisfied their bloodlust they impaled him
with a spear, and with his own walking stick pierced his chest. They scalped him and stripped him, and they
stripped the soldier.
J. Fight between the Spanish and the Indians on the road to the Presidio, where they left three dead, and the
rest fled to the Presidio badly wounded.
K. A valiant soldier who, with sword in hand, defended himself in said battle, killing many Indians. He was
impaled through the chest with a lance, left for dead and stripped; recovering, he walked to the Mission,
where he was thrown on the fire; he escaped from it miraculously and was confessed before dying.
L. The defense of the Spanish from the huts, in which many [Indians] were killed.
M. The burning of the Mission.
N. The death of Father Santiesteban. They beat him and then cut off his head and kicked it about.
O. The outrages and desecrations that were performed upon the holy images, and the destruction of the divine
standard of Nuestra Señor de Rufugio [sic], the patroness and protector of the Mission.
P. During the night the remaining soldiers escaped miraculously, and the women and children passed through
the rabble without being seen.
Q. The death of the majordomo. While he was still alive, they gouged out his eyes and then stripped the flesh
from his entire body.
R. Sack of the Mission.

the age of 40 years. He met his death in the manner depicted in this painting.

described in the mission’s Inventory of Supplies as the Divina Pastora (The Virgin
Mary as Divine Shepherdess) “painting on linen” (see Chapter 14 and Appendix B).
Because the written eyewitness testimonies never mention this item or the Indians
taking it, it is plausible that the Destruction artist learned the details of this religious
painting directly from one of the eyewitnesses. The specific identity of this banner
painting is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
Ratcliffe (1991:532; 1992:15) reviews the attack by following the lettered
statements in the central cartouche. These letters are not limited to the chronological
sequence of events. Letters A–D refer to the landscape and structures as isolated
elements, while the events of the attack begin with letter E, “The Entrance of the
Barbarous Indians into the Mission” (Ratcliffe 1991:524). According to Father
Molina, this occurred “a little after sunrise…after Father Terreros had said mass
and just before Father Santiesteban was beginning the second service” (Dunn
1914:404; Nathan and Simpson 2000:84). The next mention of a time frame is
Molina’s testimony that, “At about eight o’clock in the morning the imprisoned men
were startled to hear a knocking at the door,”—it was Joseph Vásquez, a soldier
sent from the presidio. Molina’s testimony is the best gauge for the passage of
time, “From our closed room we fired through loopholes prepared in advance and
thus defended ourselves until after midday” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:88). Later,
Molina explained, “All day long and far into the night the Indians continued their
orgies.” The Spaniards remained in the Father President’s room until noon, “when
the flames reached them... They then moved to the ‘church building’…and later ‘into
the small chapel’” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:88–89). Parrilla then sent 15 soldiers
out “as soon as darkness fell…to learn whether an attack upon the Indians would
be feasible,” and this distraction “afforded the imprisoned Spaniards the long hoped
for chance of escape” (Dunn 1914:409–410). Juan Leal, who had been hiding with
Molina since the first attack, stated that “about nine o’clock in the evening…the
mission dogs began to bark, at which the Indians became excited and rushed down
to the river, where they kept a close watch the rest of the night. Thus everyone was
able to escape” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:75). The exact timing of their escape is
difficult to ascertain, but it was sometime after 9:00 p.m.
It appears that the events depicted in the painting span a period of at
least 14 hours from dawn (probably around 7:00 a.m.) until sometime after 9:00
p.m. The central cartouche contains 18 events through the letter R, which refers

311

312

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
generically to the “Sack of the Mission.” But the final specific event depicted is
designated P, “During the night the remaining soldiers escaped miraculously.” The
events in the painting mirror those outlined by the eyewitness accounts, and the
artist undoubtedly had a good grasp on the story before he began painting. From
the artist’s perspective, the painting was about a series of related events.
In terms of its subject matter and artistic style, it exhibits many attributes
common in eighteenth-century Spanish and European paintings. As a landscape
image of an historical event, it fits well into two common themes of the period.
In an article on “The Evolution of History Painting,” Roworth (1993:220–222)
notes that painting themes and styles that evolved in the Renaissance period
and were in vogue in the eighteenth century included depictions of contemporary
significant events and panoramic or bird’s-eye views of specific locations. As
distinguished from the genre paintings of everyday life, many paintings began to
depict “singular, documented events in real places.” Such works were intended to
“tell a specific story” and function as “a historic narrative” (Roworth 1993:222).
The massacre and martyrdom themes embedded in the painting are not unusual,
and paintings during and after the Renaissance were sometimes commissioned “to
commemorate significant occasions, such as councils, church dedications, and the
founding of institutions, or infamous events, such as notorious crimes, murders,
and massacres” (Roworth 1993:220).
The overall reddish tint is also characteristic of the period. With respect
to the art associated with California missions, Baer (1993:53) states: “Since the
majority of mission paintings appear to have been executed during the eighteenth
century, another characteristic of that period must be mentioned. In addition to the
dominance of ochres, vermillion-reds, and clear blues, the canvases are pervaded
by a peculiar reddish cast, due either to the previously mentioned tinting of the
ground, or to a definite underpainting in the red-vermillion.”
Another theme clearly evident is the graphic display of the barbaric acts
of the attacking Indians. This was certainly intended to stir the viewer’s emotions,
to evoke shock and horror at the violent events and pity for the innocent victims.
But the display of barbarism is also a reflection of the classic Spanish world view
common throughout the colonial period: the social superiority of the Spanish and
the subhuman nature of the godless Natives. The concept of racial superiority is
best seen in the eighteenth-century casta paintings of New Spain, which have been
extensively studied by art historians, historians, and archeologists (e.g., Carrera
2003; Donahue-Wallace 2008; Loren 2007; Scott 2005). Casta paintings were sets of
portraits of people, with multiple portraits placed in order according to the rigid social
hierarchy of the times. These richly detailed paintings may be of one or more people
in a particular setting, but they always emphasize the ethnic and racial differences
(such as skin color, clothing, and foods) between the different caste groups within
Spanish colonial society. As described by Loren (2007:23), casta paintings had social
meaning that reinforced the “regimen de castas, a system used to hierarchically grade
individuals by racial criteria” following the “limpieza de sangre” (purity of blood)
concept. Galloway (1991:34) suggests: “While colonial images have an aesthetic
appeal, they were produced and viewed within a specific political environment that

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
graded people according to their racial and social pedigree.” For the elite Spaniards
who viewed the Destruction painting in the latter half of the eighteenth century,
the images must have been filled with such social meaning and an air of Spanish
dominion over lesser beings.
The Continuous Narrative Genre
The Destruction painting was created in a continuous narrative style,
which is defined by one art historian as “presenting the various episodes of a single
narrative against the same background and, in effect, uniting them in the same
composition, the same figures always being repeated for each episode” (defined
by Bianchi Bandinelli [1955:149] as cited in Small [1999:568]). The continuous
narrative is well documented in various forms of classical art of the ancient Greeks
and Romans (Small 1999), and it was revived during the Renaissance when Italian
painters commonly employed it (Andrews 1995; Hendricks 2011). The technique is
beautifully illustrated in the 1485 painting called The Story of Joseph by Biagio
d’Antonio. This painting depicts the biblical story of Joseph from the book of Genesis,
and the artist added written names to identify the main characters (J. Paul Getty
Museum 2011), in a manner similar to the letters denoting events in the Destruction
painting. Another good example of a Renaissance-period continuous narrative is
the 1543 painting of St. John the Baptist Retiring to the Desert by the Giovanni di
Paolo. In describing it, Simon (1992:114) writes:
…the saint is shown striding out of the city gates and then again,
on the stony road to the desert. We are not confused by this; we read
the painting as a strip cartoon. Each John the Baptist is the same
size and wears the same pink shirt, and carries the same bundle of
sticks. Time, as a sequence of events, has been evaded and distance
used as the difference between a state and its backdrop.
In his review of the colonial images of Spanish North America, Fontana
(2000) notes that sixteenth- to eighteenth-century images that pertain to the
northern frontier of New Spain are indeed rare, and only the 1760s Destruction
painting and the two Segesser hide paintings from the 1720s “show events painted
sequentially on a single canvas.” The Destruction painting “shows various stages
of the battle­–prologue, the event, and post-lude–­in one grand depiction” (Fontana
2000:932–933). A comparison of the Destruction and Segesser hide paintings is
presented later in this chapter.
The Motivation for Its Creation
There are theories about why Don Pedro Romero de Terreros decided to pay
an artist to create the Destruction of Mission San Sabá painting. One idea offered
by Ratcliffe (1991:517) is that it was, in effect, a “remembrance” painting created
“specifically to memorialize a deceased family member.” Because one of the martyred
priests was Don Pedro’s cousin, Fray Alonso Giraldo de Terreros, this explanation is
plausible. But White (2000:143) offers an alternative, and slightly less philanthropic,
motivation. He suggests that:

313

314

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
…his intentions were not simply to record the event for historical
purposes but most certainly to insure that he had ample record
of his service to the Crown. The historical importance of the work
would not be realized for decades. His reasons may have included
the desire to commemorate the sacrifice of his cousin and to decry
pagan barbarism. But considering the philanthropic attitude of the
future Conde, his primary motivation was more likely to document
the high costs borne by the his family in the failed mission endeavor.
The painting was, it can be argued, commissioned to create a visual
reminder of the expected rewards for those costs.
White (2000:147, n. 244) also believes that the painting was always kept in
Terreros’s personal quarters and states: “The fact that the painting was not donated
to the Franciscans or to the Spanish government, but kept by the family suggests
that the patrón wanted to continually remind the family of the expected reward to
them by the King.” His strategy apparently worked well, because Romero de Terreros
was awarded the title of Conde de Regla in 1768, a decade after Mission San Sabá
fell (Weddle 1964:41; White 2000:118).
HISTORICAL ACCURACY OF THE PAINTING
Questions regarding the level of historical accuracy are paramount. Does
the painting accurately depict the historical events of the mission attack, and whose
perspective does it represent? Does it accurately depict the landscape and physical
details of the mission compound and building architecture? Does it accurately show
small-scale details such as the horse gear, weapons, and people’s clothing?
As detailed below, the painting appears to be accurate in many ways, but it
is difficult to separate these into discrete categories because all of the elements––
the historical events, the landscape, the mission compound, the buildings, and even
the small-scale details––are intertwined both in the painting and the archival
documents. What we know about the mission setting, the mission compound, and
the buildings within it are revealed through the eyewitness testimonies generated
in response to the attack on the mission, and the painting is simply another form
of documentary evidence. But it also contains many elements and details that
are never mentioned in the testimonies. Thus, it has the potential to add to our
knowledge of the event, interpretations of the archeological remains, and the mindset
of eighteenth-century Spaniards.
The Painting as a Source of Information
How reliable is the painting as a source of information? To answer this
question, it is helpful to understand the artist’s purpose in painting it. Ratcliffe
(1991:533) states that: “While the canvas may serve as something of a visual
documentation of the massacre, it was intended primarily to be a work of hagiography
[the study of the lives of the saints], with history being a secondary, though admittedly
important, consideration.” White (2000:144), however, notes that the painting’s value
as a historic document was not recognized until the twentieth century, and that
many historians only considered it to be a remembrance piece or hagiography (see

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
Ratcliffe 1991:517). He continues, “Yet they missed clues of the true intentions in
the commission of the painting that are found within the context of the lives of the
people involved with the mission effort” (White 2000:144). White (2000:7) believes
that the accuracy of the painting is “confirmed to a large extent by the records of
the inhabitants of the mission and the official records of the missionaries.”
The cartouche at the bottom center outlines the events over the course of a
day (see Table 13.1), although it is not a complete sequence and the events are not
shown in precise chronological order. According to White (2000:43), “The carefully
explained events, shown indexed and alphabetized, are intended to verify the events
depicted. This is a significant indication that this was intended to be an accurate
record from the point of view of the missionaries and soldiers.” White (2000:43, 44)
goes on to explain that a comparison of these details with statements given by the
Spanish survivors of the attack (Nathan and Simpson 1959, 2000) also verifies “that
the painting is an accurate recording of the event,” and he points out that, since all of
the events could not have been known by only one person, it is “reasonable to believe
that the painting compiles the eyewitness accounts of more [than] just one person.”
Finally, he outlines four compositional devices commonly used by eighteenth-century
European artists to narrate battle scenes, and he identifies these four devices in the
Destruction painting. He suggests the use of these devices demonstrates the artist’s
intent for narration and accuracy: “(1) dark and light skies or clouds used as visual
rhetoric; (2) landscape as a compositional technique for spatial illusionism; (3) an
elevated foreground; and (4) placement and symbolism of figures” (White 2000:44).
Of particular interest is his observation that the painting also displays the trend in
this time period toward using mapping skills in the depiction of landscapes (White’s
2000:58–62).
Grant Hall (personal communication 2010) agrees that the painting was
intended as an accurate representation. But he believes that archeological evidence
and eyewitness testimony transcripts (as published in The San Sabá Papers) are
more important due to the unknown extent of artistic license inherent in the painting.
For example, he points out that, while some of the artifacts found at the mission are
present in the painting (e.g., musket balls as evidence of firearms), some of the mostcommon artifacts, such as the Spanish ceramics, are not depicted. In addition, no
domestic animals other than horses are apparent, but we know that oxen were also
killed and butchered during the attack. Perhaps, ceramics and oxen were deemed
irrelevant to the narrative. He also notes that the painting does not show the full
attacking force of the hostile Indians. The depictions certainly fall short of the 1,500
to 2,000 Norteño Indians estimated in some accounts61 and they also fall short of
Dunn (1914:406, and footnote 7) reviewed the Spanish documents to extract the various
estimates of the number of attackers. Father Molina indicated 2,000 attackers (also see Nathan
and Simpson 2000:88), and this number was also stated by Colonel Ortiz Parrilla in a March 27,
1758, letter. In 1772 (14 years after the attack), Bonilla estimated the number as 2,000. In 1784,
some 26 years after the attack, Cabello estimated only 700 attackers. Not long after the attack,
some Orcoquiza Indians declared that there had been only about 400 attackers, but Dunn felt
this number “is probably an underestimate.” It is notable that Ortiz Parrilla also discounted the
Orcoquisa Indians’ estimate, noting that the number of attackers was “exceedingly large” (Letter
from Ortiz Parrilla to Father Dolores, May 22, 1758, published in Wade [2007:138–139, 208]).
Perhaps one of the more reliable estimates was by Sergeant Joseph Antonio Flores, an experienced
soldier who estimated the number of hostile Indians at 1,500 in his eyewitness testimony (Nathan
and Simpson 2000:47).
61

315

the estimated 1,000 attackers as stated in the painting itself. The letter F in the
central cartouche states that the captain of the Indian army was “advancing at the
head of one thousand men” (see Table 13.1). If the attacking force included 1,000
or more people, or even many hundreds of people, it would have been impossible to
depict them all in the painting.
The Landscape
While most researchers generally believe that the painting depicts
events somewhat accurately, there is less agreement about the landscape and
environmental details. Casual observers have acknowledged that the mountainous
landscape surrounding the river is highly exaggerated. In the eyes of some, this
dramatization limits the credibility of the rest of the painting. Hall (personal
communication 2010) specifically notes that even the topography in the San
Saba River valley is exaggerated and that the presidio is not that much higher
in elevation than the mission. Ratcliffe (1991:523, footnote 38) notes that the
landscape is highly idealized, and Weddle suggests it “bears a closer resemblance to
the countryside around Don Pedro Romero Terreros’s boyhood home of Cortegana
than the site of the mission.”
Generally, researchers acknowledge that some degree of artistic license was
taken in the painting, especially as it pertains to the visual perspective of the event,
but each researcher has different ideas on the degree of accuracy of many aspects
of the painting. For example, most agree that, while the landscape is exaggerated,
the painting correctly shows the San Saba River to the right and behind the mission
and the presidio in a relatively accurate position in the far background at the upper
left. Most also agree that the number of structures depicted within the mission
compound is generally accurate based on comparisons to the archeological evidence.
However, there is much less agreement on specific details of the landscape and the
layout of the mission compound.
Figure 13.3 provides annotations that point out specific landscape features
and cardinal directions mentioned in the discussions that follow. The features and
ideas discussed below relate to Harris Hollow, the directional orientation of the
mission compound, the stockade, the wattle-and-daub building architecture, the
overall layout of components within the compound, and the eastern extent of the
mission compound.
Harris Hollow
The painting depicts two clusters of large trees on either end of a slight
vegetation-filled swale just behind the mission compound, and it is reasonable to
suggest that this topographic feature represents Harris Hollow. Harris Hollow is an
ancient channel scar of the San Saba River that was present at the time of the mission
occupation (McWilliams and Boyd 2006:23, 89). Hall (personal communication 2010)
suggests that the painting does not depict this level of landscape detail and that the
feature is not Harris Hollow. But the archival record provides one line of evidence to
support this interpretation. In a testimony given five days after the mission attack

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
317

318

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
by a soldier, Joseph Vásquez mentions “el canon de tierra que hay entre las lomas
y el rio” (Vásquez 1758) which translates as “the dry canyon between the river and
the hills.” In Nathan and Simpson’s (2000:81) translation, they use word “ravine”
to define this landform, also stating that it lies “between the hills and the river.”
During the massacre, Indians attacked a unit of soldiers in the “dry canyon.” Several
soldiers were killed there and later buried where they lay. The English translation
of the phrase is important, because the word canon would imply a more robust
landform than a ravine.
The initial geomorphological study by Greg Schlenker (1991:Figure 10)
interprets Harris Hollow as an alluvial stream and discusses the age of the
stratigraphic units in terms of millennia. In the subsequent study associated with
this project (see Chapter 4), two radiocarbon dates were obtained on sediments in
Harris Hollow, and they demonstrate the age of the infilled sediments. Collectively,
the geomorphic and chronological evidence indicates that Harris Hollow was a
river channel more than 2,300 years ago, but that during the Spanish occupation
it was probably an overflow chute beginning to fill in with fine-grained alluvium.
During the Spanish occupation, but the channel relief was probably not more than
5 m anywhere along its course.
Harris Hollow was a prominent topographic feature in Spanish times, but
it would not have qualified as a canyon. If Vásquez was actually referring to a
canyon, he might have been speaking about one of the erosional scars in the uplands
on the north side of the valley, perhaps even the Scalp Creek drainage north of
the mission (see Figure 1.1). But his statement that this feature was “between
the hills and the river” implies that it was somewhere on the San Saba River
floodplain. If so, then the “hills” can only mean the upland edges of the valley, and
any topographic feature that was between the hills and the river would most likely
have been an abandoned river channel. Thus, the authors believe that Vásquez’s
reference does describe Harris Hollow and that it was a prominent ravine during
the mission occupation.
The Mission Stockade and Structures
Composed of a large wooden stockade and many buildings, the compound
as depicted in the painting generally corresponds with the details in the archival
documents. Some obvious features, however, are noticeably absent. The buildings
and other features that are mentioned in the eyewitness testimonials, as listed in
Hindes et al. (1995: Table 4), are:
Kitchen
Corral
Father President’s room
Gate/entrance
Patio
Courtyard
Chapel/church
Storehouse
Clothing storehouse

Cannon
House next to church
Cemetery
Outbuildings
Workshops
Various other buildings
Quarters
Indian quarters

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
This list is problematic in some ways, because eyewitnesses may have used
different names for the same building in some cases. For example, what one person
called a storehouse another person may have called a workshop. Thus, even this
simple listing cannot be used to determine the exact number of buildings within or
near the mission compound.
The painting clearly lacks depictions of the corral and the cemetery and any
outbuildings beyond the mission stockade. It is not clear if these elements were left
out because they could not be seen from the chosen viewpoint (e.g., they were hidden
behind buildings or the stockade) or if they were omitted because they were not
relevant to the artist’s goals. The painting also lacks many specific details that would
help identify particular buildings within the compound by their functions (i.e., the
storehouses, the kitchen, priest’s quarters, and other living quarters). However, the
painting provides some important clues. For example, the clothing being removed
from one of the structures in the center left of the compound might indicate the
building was the clothing storehouse.
Orientation of the Mission Compound
In general, researchers agree that the layout of the mission compound in the
painting is skewed relative to the landscape. This may reflect the artist’s desire to
show all of the key events in a small space within the walled enclosure. Most of the
group (Boyd, McWilliams, Hindes, and Wolf) agree that, if the stockade is rotated
by taking its back left corner and turning it about one-quarter turn to the left, the
orientation of the rectangular mission compound makes better sense (see Figure
13.3). By doing this, the stockade would then be oriented with its long axis running
east to west, and the stockade wall in front (closest to the viewer) becomes the east
wall of the compound.
Such rotation would position the small buildings that line the interior of
the stockade along the south and west sides. Archeologically, there are postholes
representing an uneven row of perhaps three or four small structures along the
south side of the compound (see Figure 11.5). In the painting, the main cluster of
buildings is in the back half of the stockade, with more in the upper left corner.
The cluster of buildings in the back left corner would therefore represent buildings
along the southern edge and southwest corner of the compound.
Based on the graphic evidence described above and the archeological evidence
(mainly postholes and wall trenches), most of the San Sabá researchers believe that
the PAI excavations are along the south side of edge of the mission compound. If
so, the artist intentionally rotated the mission compound clockwise. It also means
that the compound enclosed within the stockade was about twice as long as it was
wide. The painting shows half of the enclosed area with buildings in it, with the
other half an open plaza or courtyard. The authors believe the archeological evidence
discussed below may support this interpretation.
Hall (personal communication 2010) disagrees with the idea that the mission
compound is accurately depicted. He believes that “the vantage is all artistic license,
except in the broadest sense of the presidio being upstream, west of, and on the other

319

320

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
side of the river from the mission.” He thinks the archeological evidence indicates
that the artist distorted the layout of the mission compound and all of the structures
within it to suit his artistic needs.
The Stockade
Archival documents indicate that there was a wooden stockade around the
outside of the mission compound, as depicted in the painting. The modern concept of
the translated word “stockade” implies a structure that is: (1) intended for protection
and defense; and (2) of sufficient strength and height to protect the occupants.
However, the painting depicts individuals standing along a stockade that reaches
only to their shoulders, suggesting a height of only 4–5 ft. It is certainly possible
that the artist took liberties and lowered the height of the walls to allow the viewer
to see the activity inside.
The archival record offers minimal information regarding the height of the
stockade. The following observations are based on eyewitness statements (emphasis
added in bold italics):
•

Vásquez was injured during the massacre and the attacking Indians
“threw him into the burning stockade,” but they had thrown
him “beyond the flames.” He pretended to be dead until he saw his
opportunity for escape, and he “was able to cross the few paces between
the place where he had fallen and the Father President’s quarters,
where he took refuge” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:81). This statement
suggests that Vásquez was actually thrown over the wall, and it implies
that the wall was short.

•

“The steward therefore decided to send him [Gutiérrez] armed with a
musket over the wall of the stockade on the side toward the river, so
that he could escape under cover of the forest along its banks” (Nathan
and Simpson 2000:44). This suggests that the wall was scaleable—or at
least easily climbed—and thus perhaps short.

•

“Hearing expressions of amity, the corporal of the guard, Asencio
Cadena, mustered up courage enough to venture out into the patio
or open space in front of the mission. Through the cracks in the
stockade he could see Indians peering through” (Dunn 1914:405). This
statement implies that the stockade wall may have been taller than
Acencio Cadena, although the Indians could have been stooping to peer
through the walls.

It is impossible to infer the height of the stockade wall from these statements
with much confidence. It may be that the stockade was only about 5 ft tall, and some
people could see over it while others could not.
The painting shows the stockade (or palisade) as a wall of tightly spaced
vertical posts, and this would imply that the posts must have been placed into a
continuous wall trench. This type of construction is contradicted by the archeological
evidence, since the TTU archeologists found only sporadic remnants of wall trenches

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
(mostly near the southern property fence) and lines of deep postholes spaced far
apart (see Figures 4.7 and 5.11). This descrepancy suggests some artistic license in
execution of the painting. Alternatively, the stockade walls may have been built in
a manner that did not require deep continuous wall trenches.
Summarizing the 1997 TTU investigations, Hall (2001) states that the
trackhoe stripping exposed about 100 post stains and 30 features. The TTU
archeologists believe that many of the isolated postholes they found are associated
with the stockade wall, while the segments of wall trenches are associated with
jacal structures located near the south edge of the compound. One scenario that
would promote concurrence between the archeological evidence and the painting
posits that the palisade posts may have been contiguous but not all set at the same
level inside a wall trench. Perhaps the postholes the TTU archeologists uncovered
held deep, widely spaced main posts, with intervening posts resting on the ground
surface or in shallow wall trenches obliterated by historic and modern cultivation.
Two lines of historical evidence support this argument. First, the stockade
was a temporary enclosure and not a permanent fortification. When the mission
and presidio were established, stockade construction was one of the first activities
undertaken. This was done quickly to provide protective enclosures. During the 14
years that the presidio was occupied (1857–1770; Walter et al. 2003:1–3), the original
wooden stockade was replaced with a second more-substantial wooden stockade and
finally with a stone wall fortification (Kimbell 2010). In contrast, the mission did
not survive long enough for this to occur, and the stockade depicted in the painting
was the first and only enclosure.
In March 1761, the presidial commander Phelipe de Rábago y Theran wrote
a letter in which he noted the “miserable condition” of the original stockade and
described the second wooden fortification that he was building. He stated that “I am
equipping and fortifying the entire presidio with a thick palisade that is not less
than 8.3 feet in height, not counting 4.3 feet fixed in the ground” (Wolf 2005:51).
This implies that the original stockade was significantly shorter and more poorly
constructed than the one he was building. It sounds like the second stockade may
have been composed of contiguous posts set into a deep wall trench, and the first
stockade probably was not built in this manner. The original stockade was being
replaced only four years after it was constructed, again implying that it was hastily
built and intended as a temporary enclosure.
Second, historical descriptions of the chamacuero construction technique
could be consistent with this interpretation. A report written by the interim
commander of the presidio in October 1760 describes the original stockade as
follows: “The construction of this presidio is composed of a surrounding stockade
in the manner of chamacueros, as they are called in these lands. It will not last
long, since the posts in the ground will rot and the houses will be ruined—as has
happened with two of them that have collapsed” (Wolf 2005:48). In this context, the
term chamacuero (or chamaquero) refers to the technique of using rawhide strips to
lash the posts together. Wolf (2005:58, footnotes 3 and 10) notes that chamacuero and
jacal are both terms for “makeshift structures used for living or utility purposes, but

321

322

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
to contemporaries there was a clear distinction between the two. The chamacueros
were evidently built with upright posts that were secured with leather (cuero).”
In a report on the archeology and history of Applewhite Reservoir area
south of San Antonio, McGraw and Hindes (1987:249) describe the “early ethnic
Mexican vernacular architecture known as palisado or chamacuero, an elaboration
of the simple jacal in use in the 18th and early 19th centuries in San Antonio.” They
quote a local informant named Adolph Herrera, who described chamacuero house
construction as follows:
Long cedar poles were cut and then placed vertically in the ground
where windows or doors were to be located—subsequent poles were
placed every 2 to 2-1/2 feet. Cypress from the river banks was then
cut for shingles and small cypress strips were placed horizontally
between the cedar poles, using pegs or square nails. Stones, broken
into small chunks, where then placed in between the poles/strips
using adobe. The adobe was then pressed/thrown in to fill any chinks
remaining—the whole wall was then smoothed with the adobe.
This statement is clearly referring to house construction, rather than building
a stockade wall, but chamacuero can refer to the manner in which the wooden
framework was built. This statement depicts chamacuero wall construction as being
very similar to jacal wall construction.
Fox (1983:334) provides a simple definition based on the Casas House in
San Antonio: “It had a thatched roof and walls constructed of upright posts bound
together with rawhide strips, chinked and plastered with mud and whitewashed.
This method of construction, and chamacuero or palisado, was common in the San
Antonio area during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.” The chamacuero
construction method is also described by Smith (1999:88–89), who states:
Jacal, palisado, and chamacuero—picket or palisade vertical
construction—had been a traditional alternative south and west
Texas building method since the Spanish Colonial era, and remained
so after the Civil War. A Sixth Cavalry troop said of his seven-foot
high, fourteen-by-twenty-foot rectangular “picket” barracks at
Jacksboro, Texas in 1866: “The building of one was simple; a trench
of proper size was dug, say one foot wide and deep, four extra-sized
posts were placed at the corners, then the remainder of the ‘pickets,’
usually from four to six inches through, were sawed a proper length
and set in the ditch or trench, side by side, a ‘plate’ was spiked on
the top, a roof, slightly inclined, was made by laying poles side by
side, the interstices filled with twigs, and the whole covered thickly
with dirt. The spaces in the walls were ‘chinked’ with chips and
plastered with mud….” Palisado construction was similar, but with
one refinement: Rather than buried in a setting trench, the vertical
posts or boards were tied or nailed to a log-based sill resting on the
ground.
Although not explicitly stated, this description suggests that the corner posts of the
chamacuero barracks would have been set into deeper postholes because they were
larger posts that supported the entire structure.

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
After studying the Spanish documents and completing excavations in and
around one of the corner bastions at Presidio San Sabá, Kimbell (2010:Figures
90 and 91) presented reconstruction drawings of the original adobe bastion and
wooden stockade (built in 1757) and compared it with a reconstruction drawing of
the second wooden bastion and stockade (rebuilt in 1761). These two drawings depict
very different kinds of stockade walls. The original 1757 stockade wall is shown as
a chamacuero fence of gnarly vertical branches lashed toigether with horizontal
braces (Figure 13.4). In contrast, the 1861 wooden stockade is shown as far more
substantial with tall straight vertical posts laid edge to edge in a trench. Since the
original stockades at the presidio and mission were built at the same time, for the
same purpose (i.e., a temporary enclosure), and by the same people, it stands to
reason that they would have been constructed in a similar manner.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
The painting depicts a rectangular stockade with its long axis running
generally north (or northwest) to south (or southeast). This is not consistent with
the square reconstruction that Cavallin-Cosma (2000:Figures 5.1–5.4) offers based
on the distribution of archeological posthole features, but there are only one or two
possible postholes that provide even a hint of where the eastern wall might have
been, and hence that wall is poorly defined relative to the others. As noted in Chapter
12, the excavations might not have extended far enough to find the east wall.
Building Architecture
The locations of buildings depicted in the painting generally correspond
with the archeological evidence. As noted in Chapter 7, the postholes and burned
daub suggest there were many jacal-like structures at the mission, and the painting
depicts similar buildings. Some of the buildings shown, including the chapel in the
center of the compound, clearly have vertical corner posts and horizontal structural
elements, and most of the other buildings clearly have thatched roofs. These are
typical of jacal architecture, and there is reason to believe that the painter was trying
to accurately depict some of the architectural details. This level of detail could not
have been gleaned from any of the written eyewitness testimonies and could only
have conveyed to the painter in person by one of the eyewitnesses.
Grant Hall (personal communication 2010) agrees that the painting is
congruent with the archeological record in its depiction of the wattle-and-daub
construction. He also believes that the painting is useful to show the relationship of
the chapel to the smaller buildings, a distinction that also is evident in the archival
records. But he thinks that the archeological remains of the chapel indicate that it
may have been a more-complex structure than the painting depicts.
Aside from the chapel, the Father President’s room is the only substantial
structure mentioned in the documents. Documentary evidence suggests that
a building that appears in the painting in the back right corner of the mission
compound may be the Father President’s room. This is the only building depicted
as having Spanish gunfire coming from it (see L in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1),
so it is clearly one of the structures where the Spanish congregated to defend
themselves. In his testimony, Father Molina stated that: “I managed to escape to
the quarters of the Father President; others did likewise….From our closed room we
fired through loopholes prepared in advance and thus defended ourselves until after
midday” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:88). When this building caught on fire, which
is depicted in the painting, the group moved to another building next to the chapel
and then into the chapel. Another piece of evidence that the burning building with
Spanish gunfire represents the Father President’s quarters is that it is adjacent
to the stockade fence. The documents note that, at one point in the attack, soldier
Joseph Vásquez was thrown into the stockade and landed only a “few paces” from
the Father President’s quarters (Nathan and Simpson 2000:81).
There has been debate regarding whether any of the structures might have
had a tile roof. The controversy stems from use of the word teja by one of the Spanish
soldiers. Luis Padilla’s eyewitness testimony states “He thought the post well-

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
protected by its stockade and by the roofs of the buildings, which were not thatched
with straw, but covered with tile to resist fire.” Nathan and Simpson (2000:95)
translated teja to mean “tile” but others think it may have meant something more
generic like adobe or mud mixed with lime (see entries under “Mission Architecture”
in Appendix A). The linguistic argument has not been resolved, but no ceramic
tile fragments were recovered during any of the archeological investigations. If
some structures had tile roofs, it is certain that tile fragments would have been
recovered. None of the building roofs shown in the painting appear to represent
ceramic tile. The chapel’s gabled roof is different from the hipped thatch roofs of the
other buildings, but the horizontal elements on it may be some type of anchoring.
Mark Wolf (personal communication 2011) suggests that teja could refer to wooden
shingles rather than ceramic tiles, and he believes the painting depicts a wooden
roof on the chapel.
Overall Layout of the Mission Compound
Within the mission compound, the painting depicts a chapel near the center,
with other buildings along two sides of the stockade encompassing nearly half of the
overall enclosed area. The painting illustrates three or four buildings along the far
side of the compound behind the chapel and another three or four to the left of the
chapel. The remaining half of the compound in front of the chapel is relatively empty,
with a large wooden cross in the center of the open space. Therefore, the painting
suggests that few artifacts or archeological features would be found in half of the
compound. This generally corresponds with the eastern portion of the archeological
investigation area, which contains few artifacts and features.
Two attempts have been made to accurately draw a map of the mission
compound based on the painting (Figure 13.5). Cavallin-Cosma (2000:60–61, Figure
5-7) concluded that the gate was on the east side of the compound. McWilliams
(this project) created a similar plan by examining the painting, counting each post,
and estimating relative distances between the posts. In both studies, the analyst
examined the post locations as depicted in the bird’s-eye view and extrapolated the
data into a plan view. These two maps are generally similar. Both depict a mission
compound that is rectangular and a stockade surrounding a cluster of buildings.
The most significant differences are the location of the stockade gate relative to the
chapel and the size and placement of the various structures in the southwest corner
of the compound. Cavallin-Cosma (2000) has a gate in the center of the east wall
directly in front of the chapel, while McWilliams has the main gate in the center
of the south wall, as indicated by priests shown in the painting passing through
the gate. The McWilliams plan also shows more open space denoting a larger plaza
area on the east side of the compound, along with the large cross planted in the
center of this area.
The painting depicts two robed Spanish priests greeting the Norteños at
the mission gate. Labeled H, the central cartouche explains that these men are
Fathers Terreros and Santiesteban, who are the martyred priests. They are shown
in the left center of the painting, midway along the stockade wall, and two or three
small buildings are farther away to the west of the gate. Based on the painting

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
and the archeological evidence, we propose that the main mission gate was on the
south wall somewhere between 5 and 20 m east of the historical monument, along
the fence line marking the north edge of the FM 2092 right of way. This is just east
of where TTU archeologists found the easternmost evidence of wattle-and-daub
structures—consisting of postholes and wall trenches about 6 m northeast of the
monument (see Figure 11.5; Cavallin-Cosma 2000:Figures 5.3 and 5.4). The 2006
excavations found a distinct concentration of artifacts (Feature 17) in this location.
It is possible that Feature 17 represents a trash disposal area just outside
the gate along the old road to the presidio. Because the main gate was an area of
so much activity, one might expect many small objects crushed by horse, cart, and
foot traffic. Some of the artifacts may have been in the trash midden prior to the
attack, while others may represent items removed from the storerooms and destroyed
near the front gate by the attacking Indians, just as depicted in the painting and
in eyewitness accounts. When Spanish soldiers visited the mission several days
later, Sergeant Flores reported that he saw “bales of tobacco, boxes of chocolate,
barrels of flour, and boxes of soap, broken apart and burning. We found crates of
church ornaments broken to pieces and charred by the flames, as well as various
sacred jewels and pictures smashed to useless fragments (Nathan and Simpson
2000:55–56). Given this deposition, the painting suggests that many items were
broken and trampled near the main gate.
No indisputable evidence of a gate was identified in the TTU investigations,
but two pairs of large postholes likely indicate a gate in the center of the west
stockade wall. Hall (personal communication 2010) believes this was the main
gate, but we propose this was a gate that led to a corral on the west side of the
stockade. A livestock corral is mentioned in eyewitness accounts, but it is absent
in the Destruction painting. Unless the main entrance went directly through the
corral, there were probably at least two gates.
The eyewitness testimonies refer frequently to the mission gate or gates.
Hindes and Wolf (1995:14–15, Table 3) reviewed the locational terms (e.g., stockade,
church, courtyard, etc.) used by the attack survivors in their depositions based on
the English translations in Nathan and Simpson (1959, 2000). These testimonies
lead to uncertainty about how many gates there were and where they were situated.
The examples listed below illustrate the contradictions in the accounts:
•

Mission servant Joseph Gutiérrez stated that the Indians found “the
gates of the stockade closed, and the cannon loaded and trained”
(Nathan and Simpson 2000:44).

•

Sergeant Joseph Antonio Flores stated that the body of Father Terreros
was “found near the entrance to the stockade” (Nathan and Simpson
2000:56).

•

Mission guard Juan Leal saw Father Terreros “struck to the ground
by a musket ball, near the gate of the stockade” (Nathan and Simpson
2000:74).

327

328

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
•

Father Molina testified that: “The barbarians took note of our
precautions and our preparations for defense, and they found out too
that the gates were not open and that it would not be easy to carry out
their evil designs” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:85).

•

Mission guard Andrés de Villareal testified: “The Reverend Father
President, with his religious, left his quarters and opened the gate of
the stockade” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:69). He went on to say that
the Indians “busied themselves with pillage and plunder all that day
and all the next night, guarding the gates and the roads to the Presidio,
except the one to the east, which they left unguarded, and it was through
it that our people escaped” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:71).

Some of these seem to refer to a single gate and some to multiple gates. It
also is possible that some of the apparent references to multiple gates could mean
one set of double-door gates at a single location. Mission guard Villareal’s testimony
is the most intriguing because it is the only one that clearly refers to multiple
gates at multiple locations. Mark Wolf (personal notes) recognized the significance
of Villareal’s statements and noted the possibility that there were multiple gates
along more than one road.
Humans tend to take the simplest and most-direct routes to perform daily
activities. Logic suggests that the mission occupants would have wanted a gate to
the main road (or roads), a gate to the corral, a gate to the nearby water sources
(the spring and river), and possibly a gate to the garden or planned fields. So
multiple gates would make sense, unless defense was the sole consideration, in
which case a single gate might have been preferred. In referring to the gates, it
may be that the Spanish were making a subtle distinction. At one point, Father
Molina mentioned an inner stockade (Nathan and Simpson 2000:86), suggesting
that there was a second, larger outer stockade or enclosure (Kay Hindes, personal
communication 2010). It is possible that many of the eyewitnesses envisioned the
mission as being defined by the inner stockade, excluding the corral, garden, and
other enclosures outside the main stockade. In this context, the attacking Indians
would have wanted to gain access through the main gate (or double gates) into the
inner stockade. Consequently, it is likely that most of the eyewitness references to
a gate or gates refer only to the main opening(s) to the inner stockade. Regardless,
the statements of Villareal carry considerable weight because they unmistakably
refer to multiple separate gates.
SOCIAL IDENTITIES AND POLITICAL ALLUSIONS:
SMALL-SCALE DETAILS IN THE PAINTING
The preceding discussion focuses on the historical accuracy of the Destruction
painting on a large scale. But the painting can also be examined from the perspective
of social identity. Who were the people depicted in the painting, and what do their
identities reveal about the underlying politics of eighteenth-century European
and Native American interactions? Within this context, it is the small-scale details
that are most revealing. Embedded throughout the painting are countless specific

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
images depicted in painstaking detail. Great care was taken to show the clothing
and headdresses worn by the Indians, the horses they rode, the weapons they
carried, specific Spanish items that were stolen, and countless other elements. It
unlikely that this plethora of details is random or a merely a product of the artist’s
imagination. This is especially true if the painting was done ed with direct input
from Father Molina and possibly other survivors.
Many of the details were certainly intentional, and they were added to
communicate specific ideas to contemporary viewers. The meanings of some details
would have been recognizable to almost any Spaniard of the era, while the meanings
of others would have been more subtle and perhaps understood only by a select
audience, such as members of the church, the military, or the political elite. Much
of this meaning is lost to modern viewers, who lack the appropriate contextual
knowledge to interpret the images.
In the following section, we attempt to decipher the graphic language of the
painting to help modern viewers understand its social and political subcontext. This
is not an exhaustive analysis but a cursory look at some of the social, political, and
historical implications of the imagery. The goal is to present some observations and
preliminary interpretations. It also is hoped that this study spurs further interest
in the painting and leads to more-comprehensive future analyses of it.
The discussions in this section focus on four groups: the Native Americans,
the Spanish missionaries, the Spanish soldiers, and the survivors of the attack.
It is likely that most, if not all, of the Indians depicted represent attackers,
collectively called the Norteños by the Spanish. 62 With the exception of some
horses being ridden by Spanish soldiers off in the distance, all of the horses in the
painting belong to the attacking Indians, and these animals are discussed under
the Native American heading. The priests are only depicted a few times, but their
individual images—the large portraits of the martyred priests on either side of
the painting—are the two most-dominant figures in the painting. The one priest
who survived is probably depicted only once. The Spanish soldiers are noticeably
underrepresented in the painting. The scarcity of Spanish soldiers does reflect the
reality of the situation, but the artist also had motivation to emphasize the large
number of hostile Indians in contrast to the small number of Spanish soldiers. The
survivors of the attack are a mixed group that includes a Spanish priest, Spanish
soldiers, and some of the soldiers’ wives and children. The survivor group also
includes some mission Indians.
The Native Americans
The painting contains hundreds of images of Native Americans, almost all
of them attacking Indians depicted at different scales reflecting the timeline of
events. “Three mission Indians” and “two Apache Indians” were among the survivors,
according to eyewitness accounts, but either they not depicted or they are too small
In some contexts, Norteños seems to refer to all the hostile Native groups in the northern
frontier of New Spain. But in other contexts, the Apaches and Comanches are identified as groups
separate from the Norteños (Harper 1953a; Wade 2003:204). It is notable, however, that the term
Norteños was not used by the mission attack survivors in their original depositions.
62

or nondescript to be recognized. Given the Spanish hierarchy of social status based
on blood purity (limpieza de sangre), it is doubtful that these Indians were considered
important enough to include. Spanish records before and after the attack seldom
mention the Tlaxcaltecans and other Indian servants who we know were at this
mission. Like the painting, this written omission speaks volumes regarding the
Spanish attitude toward Indians.
Social Identities
The attackers are grouped together in the painting and labeled collectively
as “barbarian Indians.” Where the largest depiction of mounted Indians occurs (E
in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1), it is likely that the artist would have depicted two
different groups, as this distinction was clearly important to the Spanish at the
time.63 Indeed, the closeup views of the attacking Indians, as seen in the beginning
of the attack sequence (F in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1), do seem to depict two
distinct groups based on use of different colors. Almost all of the Indians are shown
wearing some type of feathered headdress, and most are adorned with either red or
white/gray feathers. The colors chosen by the artist might be an accurate reflection
of what the Indians wore, or the colors could have been used in used in a symbolic
way. In the remainder of this section, the terms “Red” and “White” are used to refer
to the two different groups. The evidence indicates that the Red Indians represent
the Comanches while the White Indians represent the Tejas.
The Red Chief and the White Flag
One of the most frequently discussed and controversial images in the painting
is the horse-mounted Indian wearing a long red coat and carrying a white flag, in
the lower right foreground (F in Figure 13.6). The text in the central cartouche
identifies this red-coated Indian as the “Captain General of the Army.” The headdress
worn by the Red Chief appears to be a crown when viewed from a distance, but a
closer look indicates that this garment is the top of a deer’s head with ears and
antlers still attached. Each of the antler prongs is adorned with what appears to
be a pale blue ribbon. The chief has the hilt of a sword poking out from under his
red jacket, as indicated by the distinctive pommel, grip, and hand guard. The chief
is mounted on a dark brown horse that has a European-style bridle bit, and the
animal is wearing leather horse armor. It is impossible to tell if the chief is seated
on a saddle because of his large red coat, but his left foot is firmly planted in a thin
metal stirrup, implying the presence of a European-style saddle.
The Red Chief and white flag appear a second time in the painting (Figure
13.7), with the image being much smaller and on the left side of the stockade near the
open gate where the priests are standing. The man is still mounted on a dark brown
horse and is wearing the bright red coat and carrying the white flag. The antlers on
his headdress are visible, and the blue ribbons tied to each make this identification
unmistakable. Father Molina, in his eyewitness testimony given seven days after
There is abundant evidence indicating that the Spanish recognized at least five groups of Native
Americans that participated in the attack. But by the time the artist painted the Destruction in
the 1760s, the general consensus of the Spanish was that the Comanches and the Tejas were the
main guilty parties.

the attack, identified this individual and his unusual attire. Molina (Nathan and
Simpson 2000:86) stated:
I myself presented four bundles [of tobacco] to an Indian who never
did dismount and whom the others acknowledged as their Great
Chief. He was a Comanche, according to the barbarians themselves,
and worthy of respect. His war dress and his red jacket were welldecorated, after the manner of French uniforms, and he was fully
armed. His face was hideous and extremely grave.
Father Molina provided this description of the Comanche chief at the time of their
first encounter, which happened near the mission gate (H in Figure 13.2 and Table
13.1). Although not specifically talking about the Comanche chief, Molina also
mentioned that some of the attacking Indians worn “deer horns” as adornment
(Nathan and Simpson 2000:85).
One distant image may represent a third depiction of the Red Chief, but
this identification is far from positive. This possible appearance is in conjunction
with the final appearance of the White Chief at the scene of Father Terreros’s death
(I, shown as Y, in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1). In this group, there is one mounted
warrior who may represent the Red Chief, but he is no longer carrying the white flag.
The identification of the Great Chief ’s red coat is important because the
Spanish identified it as a French military jacket, which they believed was evidence
of French involvement in the attack. The red coat has a distinctive waistline, a side
pocket just below the waist, and wide cuffs. No extensive research on French uniforms
was attempted, but this style of military jacket appears to have been common in
the eighteenth century. The chief ’s coat is strikingly similar to the red coats worn
by the French soldiers in the 1720s Segesser II hide painting (Chávez 1990:Figures
3 and 4; Hotz 1991:Plates 10–13). The only significant difference is that the former
has red cuffs while the latter have blue cuffs.
Juan Leal, a presidial soldier and 25-year veteran of the Texas frontier, stated
in his testimony, “Many [of the Indians] had helmets, and many had leather jerkins,
or breast plates like those of the French” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:74). None of
these are clearly identifiable in the painting. Perhaps some of these are depicted
but are unrecognizable, or they may have been left out intentionally because only
an experienced frontier soldier would recognize them as being French. In contrast,
the guns and swords are clearly European weapons, and the Spanish knew the
Indians had obtained them from the French.
Another often-discussed detail is the white flag carried by the Red Chief.
There are no details shown on the white flag, in either the closeup or distant views
(see Figures 13.6 and 13.7). At first glance, it appears the flag in the distance has
a red band across the base. But close inspection reveals this red is not part of the
flag but a feathered headdress worn by an Indian standing immediately under
the flag. Ratcliffe (1991:525, citing Father Arricivita) notes that, “In accordance
with several eyewitness accounts, the chief is depicted carrying a white flag in
order to dupe the Spaniards.” This implies that this is a white flag of truce, but
that statement is misleading. Although many eyewitness accounts hint that the

hostile Indians deceived the missionaries by faking their peaceful intentions, no
eyewitness account ever mentioned the Indians carrying a white flag. Father Molina
never mentioned the white flag in his description of the Comanche chief, and this
is a detail he would not have overlooked. This probably means that there was no
such flag, and its appearance in the painting is artistic license in the form of an
intentional political message.
The use of a white flag of truce dates back to at least the tenth century in
Europe (Weaver 1898), but the Indians would have known its meaning only through
communication with the French. Thus, it is possible the artist may have added the
white flag of truce, whether purely on his own or at the request of an eyewitness or
a patron, to emphasize the deceitful nature of the Indians and further implicate the
French. Another possibility is that this was not a flag of truce but had a much deeper

333

334

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
meaning. The artist could have added it to represent an eighteenth-century French
military flag such as “the French ensign” that was “a simple white banner” (National
Geographic 1917:371, 402). It is possible that the artist was depicting the attacking
Indians arriving under a French military ensign as a direct accusation of French
involvement. If this is the case, it is likely that only a select group of Spaniards,
specifically military men, would have immediately recognized the symbolism and
understood its meaning.
Regardless of what the white flag signified, the political implications of
the French military coat prominently displayed are clear. It was important for the
Spanish chroniclers to document French involvement in the affair. The red coat
implicates their European enemy in supplying guns to the Indians, and it hints
that the Indian attack was organized or directed by the French (Governor Barrios
as cited in Dunn [1914:414]; Ortiz Parrilla’s letter to the Viceroy, July 4, 1758, in
Wade [2007:214]).
The White Chief
Father Molina said there “many chieftains” at the mission on the day of
the attack, but the Tejas chief, or “chieftain of the Texas Nation” is the only chief
specifically mentioned besides the Great Chief of the Comanche (Nathan and
Simpson 2000:86, 87). This chief is not described in detail, but there are four
images in the painting that seem to depict the Tejas chief at different times during
the attack.
The first appearance of the White Chief is in the lower right where the Indians
first appear at the mission (F in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1). He is immediately
behind the Red Chief, wearing a white-feathered headdress and a white or lightcolored coat (see Figure 13.6). The viewer only sees the upper part, but he is clearly
mounted on a light-colored horse with a European-style bridle bit. This man has a
gun in his lap, with the rifle barrel crossing over his left arm.
The second appearance of the White Chief occurs in the foreground in front
of the mission stockade as the Indians “encircle the Mission” (G in the Figure 13.2
and Table 13.1). Here, he wears a prominent white coat and is mounted on a lightcolored horse with horse armor and a European-style bridle, and the chief and the
horse are facing the viewer (Figure 13.8). Although this depiction shows the person’s
headdress as predominately white, red feathers may also be represented.
In his third appearance, the White Chief is shown with the Red Chief (see
Figure 13.7). Both are on the left side of the mission compound near the open gate
where the priests are standing. The White Chief appears directly underneath the
white flag carried by the Red Chief, and both are facing the gate and interacting
with one of the priests. The White Chief is identifiable because of his prominent
white coat, but the man’s headdress seems to have only red feathers. This scene is
clearly based on Father Molina’s account, which indicates that he and the Father
President (Terreros) were interacting with the Comanche chief and the Tejas chief
at the same time while in the vicinity of the mission gate.

Figure 13.8
Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting

Figure 13.8. Second depiction of the White Chief in the Destruction painting. The figure, mounted on a horse,
is wearing a white coat and white headdress.

The fourth and final depiction is in the upper left portion of the painting
(Figure 13.9). The White Chief is the warrior on the left, wearing a white coat and
white headdress and mounted on a light-colored horse clad in leather armor. The
chief is with a group of Indians who have killed Father Terreros and are scalping
him (I, which appears as Y, in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1). In his testimony, Father
Molina describes how Father Terreros interacted with the Tejas chief near the
mission gate but then lost track of him in the chaos. Molina saw Father Terreros
and a soldier on horses looking for the Tejas chief and then heading toward the
mission gate to go outside the stockade to find him. At this point, Father Terreros
and the soldier were shot somewhere in the vicinity of the gate, and the full-blown
attack began (Nathan and Simpson 2000:70, 87­–88). In this scene, the Tejas chief is
clearly implicated in initiating the attack on Father Terreros that led to his death.
It is not clear why the artist chose to show the scalping of Father Terreros at this
location outside the compound. It is possible that, after shooting Father Terreros,
the Indians dragged his body away from the stockade to strip it and scalp him. Or it

335

336

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
may be that these actions did occur near the mission gate but that this area of the
painting was already too crowded. The latter is more plausible because Terreros’s
body was found near the entrance to the stockade the day after the attack (Nathan
and Simpson 2000:55–56).
Figure 13.9

Figure 13.9. Fourth depiction of the Tejas (White) chief in the Destruction painting.

Although the white coat worn by the Tejas chief is never specifically
mentioned in the historical accounts or shown as clearly as the red coat worn by
the Comanche chief, it appears to be a European-style garment and may represent
another French military coat. Coats of a similar style appear in the Segesser II
painting, which depicts French military personnel wearing distinctive tricorne
hats and red, blue, yellow, and white coats (Chávez 1990:Figures 3, 4, and 6; Hotz
1991:Plates 9–13).
The Red and White Indians
It appears the artist differentiated between groups of Indians beyond the
two chiefs also using the colors red and white, although there are some similarities
between the Red and White Indian groups. Members of both are mounted on horses
and on foot. Both groups carry similar weapons, including guns, swords or cutlasses,
bows and arrows, lances, and hatchets. And in many locations, the Red and White
Indians are shown fighting together, perhaps to symbolize their close alliance. In
at least one other case, the use of red and white together may be symbolic of the
Comanche–Tejas alliance: In Father Santiesteban’s large portrait on the right, the
arrow protruding from chest is fletched with one red and one white feather.

Another possible identifying detail is the depiction of body tattoos on one of
the Indians (Figure 13.10). This is the only image in which body tattoos are clearly
evident, and they are unmistakably associated with a warrior wearing a white
headdress. Arnn (2012:95, 97, 100, 125) notes that body tattoos were common among
many of the Native groups that the Spanish lumped under the generic name Tejas.
Figure
13.10
He also notes that tattooing was an important social identifier that
distinguished
the Tejas peoples from other groups.
The artist’s color choices may represent
the idea that the Red Indians (Comanches)
were the more warlike of the two groups, while
the White Indians (Tejas) were more peaceful
toward the Spanish. The July 4, 1758, letter
sent by Colonel Ortiz Parrilla clearly implies
that the Tejas were considered to be Spanish
allies and that their participation in the attack
was seen as a betrayal (Wade 2007:214). Many
other mid-eighteenth-century documents suggest
that the Spanish were already aware that the
Comanche, not the Tejas, were the biggest threat
to the northward expansion of their empire
(Hämäläinen 2008:41–51). The Spanish knew
the Comanche would never submit to conversion,
and they feared them more than any other Native
group. Hence, the artist may have chosen red,
the color of blood, to depict the identity of the
warlike Comanche.
All of the Natives depicted are barefoot,
even though much attention is paid to some
aspects of the Indian’s clothing. Dan Gelo
(personal communication 2014) thinks it is
unlikely that the Indians would have been
fighting without moccasins. The fact that the
Red Chief is shown wearing a coat and leggings
but without shoes is particularly odd. Gelo
suggests that the lack of shoes may have been
intentional by the artist as yet another means of
illustrating the savage nature of the attacking
Indians.

tattoos and a white headdress in the Destruction
painting.

Indian Horses and Equestrian Gear
The Spanish eyewitness accounts make it clear that many of the attacking
Indians had horses, so it is not surprising that the painting shows many mounted
Indian warriors. The horses are equipped with saddles and metal bridle bits.
Although few details of the saddles can be discerned, the use of saddles is confirmed
by the depiction of stirrups in the Red Chief ’s first appearance, and the cantles

338

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
of saddles can be seen at the backs of four mounted Indians in the lower center.
Bridles are present on the horses belonging to the Red and White Chiefs, as well
as many others. In particular, the large group of Indians gathering at the gate on
the far side of the mission includes at least nine horses with bridles, including
those of the Red and White Chiefs. In two cases, the bridles include dark headgear
(presumably leather) with white or light-colored bits (presumably metal). The
White Chief ’s bridle (in his second appearance) also has some white spots on the
horse’s forehead, suggesting the use of reflective metal ornaments (e.g., buckles
or rosettes).
Many of the horses are draped with what appears to be painted fabric.
While these could represent ornamental horse dresses, it is more likely that they
are leather horse armor used to protect horses in battle. The use of horse armor
among some southern Plains groups is well documented in ethnographic accounts
(Chávez 1990; Fletcher and LaFlesche 1911; Hotz 1991; Hough 1895; Mitchell 2003;
Secoy 1953; Worcester 1941, 1945a).
There are six separate depictions of horse armor, used by both the Red and
White Indian groups. The first and clearest is the armor on the horse ridden by the
Red Chief in the right foreground (see Figure 13.6). This armor is light brown and
appears to be painted with dark brown, short, squiggly lines. The second occurrence
is on two horses emerging from the bushes on the right, immediately below Father
Santiesteban’s right hand and crucifix. Only the front portion of these horses is in
view, and both have European-style bridles.
The third occurrence is on the horses of four mounted warriors heading
toward the mission stockade (Figure 13.11). All are seen from behind, and the
leather armor is draped completely across the horses’ rumps, with only their legs
visible. There appears to be some dark painted designs on the brown leather armor,
and the wrinkled fold behind each rider may represent the cantle of the saddle on
which the warrior is seated. Two of the Indians have red headdresses, one does not
appear to have a headdress, and the headgear on the fourth is unclear. One of the
four warriors is wearing a light-colored garment that extends down below his waist.
At first glance, it appears that this might be a representation of the White (Tejas)
chief, but this garment is not the same kind of coat shown in the clearest image of
that chief, whose white coat expands out at the waist (see Figure 13.8). And, this
Indian also has a red headdress.
In the second appearance of the White Chief (see Figure 13.8), the horse he
is riding appears to be wearing horse armor, and the neckline of the armor appears
to be consistent with the neckline of the armor on the Red Chief ’s horse (compare
Figures 13.6 and 13.8). The White Chief ’s horse also has a European-style bridle,
as do the two horses nearby.
The fifth occurrence of horse armor is at the upper left beyond the stockade
(I, which appears as Y, in Figures 13.2 and Table 13.1). In this area, five mounted
warriors are watching the actions of the unmounted warriors, and the White Chief’s
horse is outfitted with armor decorated with the same style of dark squiggly lines
mentioned above.

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting

Figure 13.11. Closeup of the four mounted warriors riding horses equipped with leather horse armor in the
Destruction painting. The riders appear to be seated on saddles (note the high cantles behind riders), and there
are two Indian children following closely behind the horses.

The final occurrence of horse armor is with a group of mounted Indians far
in the distance engaged in combat with the Spanish soldiers close to the presidio.
This scene, illustrated below in the discussion of the Spanish soldiers, is too small
to make out any details other than that the horses are wearing armor.
There are no descriptions of horse armor or other equestrian accoutrements
in the written depositions. Consequently, the visual display of horse armor may be a
detail that the artist created on his own or, more likely, from information obtained
directly from at least one survivor. This may be a clue that the artist had personal
contact with at least one eyewitness.

339

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Horse armor also figures prominently in the Segesser I hide painting,
which was probably created in the 1720s to commemorate an unknown battle
that occurred after 1696 and before ca. 1730. The image depicts mounted Indians
carrying Spanish weapons attacking an Apache village, perhaps representing a
punitive expedition by Spaniards and their Indian allies (Chávez 1990:103; Hotz
1991:58–61). Some of the horses on which the attackers ride have horse armor
(see Hotz 1991:Plates 1, 2, 5–6). While the horse armor in the Destruction painting
appears to be flexible and painted, the armor in the Segesser I painting appears
to be rigid and smooth and lacks painted images. In the Destruction painting, the
garments cover the entire body of the horse except the legs, neck, and head, but
the rider always sits on top of the armor. In contrast, the armor in the Segesser I
painting covers the lower part of the rider’s body in what Mitchell (2003:125) calls
an “armored collar.” In his in-depth study of the Segesser hide paintings, Hotz
(1991:54­–55) describes this design:
The long covers on the two horses nearest the Apache defenders are
an early form of protection for the legs, from which were developed
the chaparajos worn by American cowboys. They are a later version
of the medieval covers worn by horses used in jousting contests. Such
coverings for horses were common in seventeenth- and eighteenthcentury America and served as protection both from enemies and
from thick underbrush and cactus.
In a study of Native American military tactics in the Great Plains, Secoy
(1953:13, 18, 35–37, 46, 53–53, 60) describes the use of leather horse armor and
how it changed through time. Southern Plains tribes that had greater access to
horses developed horse armor in the seventeenth century, but the use of protective
horse covers had spread to the northern Plains by the 1740s. It was very popular
during the period when tribes were acquiring many horses but still had limited
access to guns, a time Secoy (1953:6, 33, 51) calls the “Few Guns Period” that was
characterized by a distinctive “Post-horse–Pre-gun” military pattern. Horse armor
became popular during this period because it was effective against arrows, and its
use spread rapidly and widely. But horse armor was not nearly as effective against
bullets, so military strategies began to change as guns became more accessible. The
proliferation of guns “quickly made the old-style leather armor completely obsolete,
since it did not give enough protection from the enemy to justify its complicated
construction and heavy, cumbersome qualities” (Secoy 1953:60).64
Secoy (1953:6–10, 13, 20–21) notes that the Apache were one of the first
tribes to obtain large numbers of horses. He believes the first recorded observation
of Apaches using leather horse armor was in 1691, but they probably began using it
as early as 1650. In a more-recent study focusing on rock art depictions of leatherarmored horses in southeastern Colorado, Mitchell (2003) suggests that the use of
horse armor in the southern Plains lasted for only a century, from 1650 to 1750. He
notes that the Spanish forbid trading guns to the Indians, and that it was through
the French trade that southern Plains tribes gained enough guns to finally render
Gelo and Jones (2009:61–62) question whether the use of personal and horse armor stopped
abruptly with the widespread use of guns. They suggest that armor and shields may have survived
longer because they also served as status symbolism and a source of spiritual power.
64

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
armor obsolete. Of particular note, Mitchell (2003:125) believes that Comanches
created many of the rock art depictions showing horse armor in southeastern
Colorado and Kansas.
After comparing some of the rock art images to the horse armor depictions
in the Destruction painting, Mark Mitchell (personal communication 2011) made
several observations. He noted that the Destruction horse armor ends low on the
horses’ necks relative to the high-collared style seen in the Segesser I painting and
in most rock art images. He also noted that “many rock art images depict a series
of lines extending from the horse’s back to the lower edge of the armor” and that
this may “represent the folds or drapes in the armor, like those on the group of four
horses” in the Destruction painting (see rock art images of parallel-line horse armor
in Mitchell 2003:Figures 7–9). Mitchell also commented that horse armor shown in
the Destruction painting is relatively short, ending above the horses’ knees compared
with the longer armor extending nearly to the ground in rock art images.
One early published account of Comanches using horse armor appears in
Hough (1895). He cites a source who stated that the Padoucas (Comanches) “cover
their horses with dressed leather (probably bison hide), hanging down quite round,
which secures them from darts” (Hough 1895:646).
The widespread adoption and changing use of horse armor through time
has implications for interpreting some of the iconography in the Destruction
painting. It is clear from the painting that the Comanche and Tejas chiefs were
riding armored horses, suggesting that both groups had adopted the strategy.
Worcester (1945b:409–410) cites French historic accounts of the use of leather
horse armor by the Pawnee (Caddoan speakers related to the Wichita) in the 1720s
and the Comanche in 1724. The evidence suggests that the Comanche and Tejas
aggressors were well acquainted with horse armor before the Mission San Sabá
attack. When they planned the attack, they probably knew they had the Spanish
greatly outnumbered and that their Apache enemies would not have guns. Mitchell
(personal communication 2011) believes that the Plains tribes abandoned the use
of horse armor by the 1760s or 1770s, and he notes that the 1758 Mission San
Sabá attack occurred late. He also hypothesizes that the shorter horse armor in
the Destruction painting may reflect a natural evolutionary trend of armor reduced
in size to increase horse mobility as guns gradually became more prolific. The
decision to use or not use horse armor was a tradeoff between protection from
arrows and the speed and agility of the horse.
An alternative explanation is that the Destruction artist depicted the horse
armor inaccurately because he did not know how the real armor looked. It is possible
that the artist was unfamiliar with rigid horse armor and depicted it as a flexible
ornamental body cover like the cloth caparison worn by knights’ horses. At least one
contemporary historic account mentions Comanches riding horses dressed in some
type of caparison. In 1751, the Frenchman Pierre Mallet was traveling up the Red
River to New Mexico and he met a band of around a hundred Comanches “armed
with bows and arrows, swords and lances, wearing leather jackets and mounted on
caprisoned horses” (Kavanagh 1996:74–75).

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Indian Children
Except for the final scene of the survivors escaping discussed below, only
four children are depicted. All are associated with the attacking Indians. These four
children are at the bottom center of the painting. One child with an outstretched
arm is holding a bow, while the child just to his left has his back to the viewer but
appears to have a bow case or arrow quiver across his back. The other two children
appear to be pushing their way into a crowd of attacking Indians following the
horse-mounted White Chief.
This corresponds with the accounts of the eyewitnesses, who mentioned that
the Indians brought some children with them. Juan Leal stated that the adults
carried guns and other weapons while “some of the youth had bows and arrows”
(Nathan and Simpson 2000:74). Father Molina stated that the attackers “had
brought with them some youths armed with bows and arrows, doubtless to train
and encourage them in their cruel and bloody way of life” (Nathan and Simpson
2000:85). These Spaniards were dismayed that the attackers would have children
among them.
Pillaging
The Indians inside the stockade are shown carrying religious items, loads of
cloth, a probable saddle, and storage chests out of the storerooms and chapel (Figure
13.12). Several rectangular wooden chests have been pulled out into an open area,
and the Indians appear to be opening one of them. These images depict the looting
and pillaging described in the eyewitness accounts. Joseph Vásquez stated that the
Indians were “busily carrying bales and boxes from the storehouse, opening them,
and making off with their contents” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:82). Father Molina
saw that the Indians, “heedless of their promises of peace, were stealing the kettles
and utensils from the kitchen, and the capes of the soldiers. They also took the
horses from the corral, and then demanded more” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:86).
The religious items being taken from the chapel are of particular interest.
One Indian is leaving the chapel with a bulky pale object that appears to be about 3
to 4 ft tall. The object seems to be a religious statue, probably a saint. The only item
in the Inventory of Supplies that mentions a statue is “1 box to keep a small St. Pedro
statue” (see Chapter 14 and Appendix B, Line 258). A few days after the attack, the
presidio soldiers went to the mission to survey the destruction, and Sergeant Flores
said they found “the effigy of the Holy St. Francis had been overturned and the head
severed from the body” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:55–56). It seems unlikely that
the Inventory reference to the St. Pedro statue and the salvaged St. Francis statue
refer to the same religious object. But if the St. Francis statue was a personal item
belonging to one of the priests, it would not have been entered into the mission
inventory. In either case, the story of the statue does not end at San Sabá, because
“the severed head” of the St. Francis of Assisi statue “appeared in the inventory of
Mission San Bernardo in 1772” (Hindes [1995:13], citing Almaráz [1980:37]). Then
in 1978, a headless clay statue of St. Francis was found in a dry arroyo in Borden
County, near the well-known Comanche landmark and Comanchero trade site

called Mucha Que. Weddle and Lipscomb (2011) studied this find and concluded
that it could be the headless St. Francis statue found by Colonel Ortiz Parrilla at
the ruins of the mission.
Another group of Indians is shown in the open area in front of the chapel,
holding a long pole from which a rectangular banner painting is suspended. The
banner has a red frame around a painted image of a person clothed in blue and white
with a blue halo around the head and holding something wrapped in red, perhaps
a small child. Some of the images at the bottom of this banner painting appear to
represent children or angels, while others are indistinct. The Indians are committing
an act of desecration by poking spears and aiming their muskets to shoot holes
through the religious painting. This banner painting may be what is described in
the Inventory of Supplies (see Appendix B, Table B.1, Lines 245 and 246) as “lienzo
de las de la Divina Pastora”—a painting on linen of the Divine Shepherdess. There
were two of these linen paintings at the mission—one for the Father President and
one for “Padre Santiestevan”—and these are the only paintings mentioned in the
Inventory of Supplies. In the painting, the object is the type of banner that would
have been carried in religious processions and used for religious instruction of the
neophytes (Baer 1993:33, 45). La Divina Pastora was a favorite subject in Mexican
colonial art with “many local modifications of costume and interpretation” (Baer
1993:38). Although the identification of this banner painting is certain, it has many
of the attributes of a Divina Pastora. A ca. 1760 painting of the Divina Pastora by
the famous eighteenth-century Mexican artist Miguel Cabrera shows a haloed Virgin
Mary dressed in a blue, white, and red robe surrounded by angels and sheep (Cabrera

343

344

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
ca. 1760). If the banner in the painting is a Divina Pastora, then it is probably one
of the many variations that depicts the Virgin holding the infant Jesus.
Weapons
The European weapons used by the Indians are significant because they
highlight the trade between the Norteños and the French. The San Sabá incident
was a turning point in Spanish Texas because it was the first time that the Spanish
had ever faced so many well-armed hostile Indians. Juan Leal testified that, “It
was… evident that the said nations and many other Indians had been trading
and associating with the French, from whom they obtained arms and ammunition,
helmets, and other prized possessions which they used to good advantage. The
French supplied them with things of that sort in exchange for horses, mules, and
the meat, hides, and fat of buffalo and bear, and the skins of deer, which the Indians
take in great numbers in the open country” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:76). Leal
further noted that “The weapons of our enemies had been bows and arrows up to
now, when they used firearms to begin this cruel and bloody war” (Nathan and
Simpson 2000:76). Joseph Gutiérrez stated that the Indians had “French firearms,
bullet pouches, and very large powder horns. Others had pikes, and still others
had bows and arrows; but most of them had muskets and cutlasses” (Nathan and
Simpson 2000:44).
Most of the Indians are depicted carrying muskets (puffs of smoke indicate
they were black powder guns) and metal-tipped spears or pikes, while others
carry bows and arrows, swords, and hatchets (Figure 13.13). The muskets have
long barrels that rise above the groups of Indians in many scenes. Even in distant
scenes, one can usually distinguish the muskets from the spears and pikes by the
muskets’ distinctive shoulder stocks or the way that the weapons are held. It is
impossible to distinguish between a true Native-made spear and the European
pike, although both are mentioned in the accounts. Cutlasses and axes were
mentioned as weapons used by the attackers (Nathan and Simpson 2000:44, 53),
but they are shown only in small numbers. Absent are the bullet pouches and
powder horns, probably because they were too small to warrant much attention
by the artist.
Musket balls fired by Indians are shown entering the bodies of Fathers Terreros
and Santiesteban, and the Indians are shooting bullets into the religious banner
painting in front of the chapel (see Figure 13.11). The artist clearly went to great
lengths to depict an abundance of guns and swords carried by many hostile
Indians.
The European bladed weapons include straight-bladed swords (see Figures
13.6 and 13.9) and a few curved-bladed sabers (see Figure 13.13). It appears
that these weapons are carried primarily by the Red Indians. This may reflect
the intention of the artist to show that the Comanches were well armed with
European weapons. The Comanche had a long history of obtaining swords in trade
or capturing them in raids, and they clearly were prized possessions in many cases.
Meadows (1999:282–283) notes that “The presence of European sabers among the
Comanche has a long history in itself. Sabers were frequently given as a status

item by European powers concluding treaties with prominent Comanche leaders
and were also sought as trade items by the Comanche.” There are accounts of
the French giving sabers as gifts to the Comanches in 1723 (Meadows 1999:283),
and a 1735 Spanish account documents one or two small swords being traded
to a Comanche for buffalo hides (Kavanagh 1996:76). In 1750, the governor of
New Mexico described the Comanches as “a very barbarous people, heathen, very
disorganized, and obeying no head; but they are well supplied with arms such as
arrows, hatchets, lances, swords, and a few muskets” (Hackett 1941:323; Kavanagh
1996:72; McCulloch 2002:373). In 1751, a Frenchman traveling from Louisiana to
New Mexico met a band of around a hundred Comanches and reported they had
swords (Kavanagh 1996:74–75). In 1786, Spaniards recorded that the Comanche
chief Ecueracapa was armed with a sword given to him by New Mexico’s Governor
Juan Bautista de Anza (Kavanagh 1996:51, 115). Clearly, the Comanches were
obtaining European swords in the eighteenth century from both French and
Spanish sources.

345

346

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
While the Spanish soldiers carry the bullhide adarga (see Spanish Soldiers
below), it is odd that none of the Indians has a shield. In a review of a draft of this
chapter, Gelo (personal communication 2014) stated:
…Comanches did not abandon hide shields in the face of gun combat;
they consistently carried shields until sugjugated in 1875, well into
the period when firearms were much more effective than they were
when San Saba was attacked. Their shields had medicinal protective
power and were hard enough to turn bullets as well as arrows fired
from a distance. It is possible that they abandoned shield use for
some interim period when firearms first became prevalent but that
does not seem likely, for at the same time we see no shields here, we
see the probable continuance of horse armor. The San Saba attack
may have been an idiosyncratic Indian experiment in close-quarters
combat with musket, lance, and sword, without shields or much use
of the bow and arrow. That would be another interesting argument
for the historical value of the painting.
Spanish Missionaries and the Mayordomo
The Spanish missionaries appear in several scenes and are mentioned in all
three cartouches (see Table 13.1). First and most prominently, the full-body images
of Fathers Terreros (left) and Santiesteban (right) flank the mission attack scene,
each depicted at the time of his death along with the weapons used to kill him. In
these large images, the men wear the classic wardrobe of the Franciscan priest—a
long grayish-brown robe and sandals—and have a clerical tonsure (i.e., a shaven
crown hairstyle). The Franciscan priest depicted in the Segesser II hide painting
is shown running with a crucifix and wearing a “bluish green” robe and a clerical
tonsure (Hotz 1991:Plate 13; 139–140, 208). The similarities in the depictions of the
priests in both paintings reflect the distinctive nature of the priests’ clothing and
hairstyle for the time and the ease with which different artists were able to convey
the identity of Catholic clergy.
Each martyred priest appears two more times in much smaller images
showing events at different times on the day of the attack. Both are seen “greeting”
the Indians at the gate of the mission (see Figure 13.7) and in their final death
scenes.65 Father Santiesteban’s death is depicted in the center of the painting, just
left of the chapel (see Figure 13.12). He is lying on the ground while an Indian
slits his throat with a knife. The same cleaver-like knife is shown in the oversized
image of the priest framing the right side of the painting. The manner of his death
is confirmed by the Spanish documents. Santiesteban’s body was not found when
the soldiers from the presidio arrived soon after the attack. Several days later, they
returned to search for his remains and found his decapitated body and then his
head in the ruins of the clothing storehouse (Nathan and Simpson 2000:56, 98).

Dan Gelo (anthropologist and ethnohistorian at the University of Texas at San Antonio) reviewed
and commented on a draft of this chapter. He noted that the death scenes of the martyred priests
are reminiscent of medieval and renaissance paintings of St. Sebastian, an early Christian saint
and martyr who was persecuted and killed by Romans in about a.d. 288. In numerous paintings,
St. Sebastian is depicted as bound to a tree or a column and shot with multiple arrows.
65

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
Father Terreros’s death scene is depicted in an open area beyond the mission
compound (see Figure 13.9). He is shown lying on the ground with one Indian
scalping him and two others stabbing him. The painting’s cartouche states that
Father Terreros was scalped and stabbed with a spear and his walking stick (I,
which appears as Y, in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1). In a smaller image to the left
of and below Terreros’s death scene (Figure 13.14), two Indians are playing with an
object suspended in the air on long poles. This small object appears to be the scalp
taken from Father Terreros, and it matches the clerical tonsure worn by both of the
martyred priests. There is no documentary evidence that the Indians displayed the
scalp in this way. The artist could have depicted an event based on an eyewitness
account, or it may represent artistic license intended to emphasize the barbaric
Figure 13.14
actions of the Indians.

Figure 13.14. Closeup of two Indians playing with the scalp taken from Father Terreros in the
Destruction painting. Note that the wounded Spanish soldier may be identified in written records
as Joseph Vásquez.

The only priest who survived was Father Molina. He was one of the most important
eyewitnesses to the events of that day, but he is a minor character in the painting.
Father Molina is only shown once as one of the group of survivors escaping in the
distance.
Aside from the priests, only one mission official is depicted. Listed as Q in
the cartouche, the event is described as: “The death of the majordomo. While he
was still alive, they gouged out his eyes and then stripped the flesh from his entire

body” (see Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1). The mayordomo (mission administrator) was
Juan Antonio Gutíerrez. He was wounded and was unable to escape with the rest of
the group later that night (Nathan and Simpson 2000:75; Terreros 2004:24). When
the presidio soldiers inspected the mission after the attack, they found Gutiérrez’s
corpse “without eyes or scalp” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:56).
Spanish Soldiers
Spanish soldiers are poorly represented in the painting, especially in the
closeup scenes. Many are depicted, but they are far off in the distance inside or near
the presidio. None are inside the mission compound, although their gun barrels and
gunfire are seen in the windows of one of the burning buildings. This building is
designated L and is described in the cartouche as “The defense of the Spanish from
the huts, in which many [Indians] were killed” (see Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1).
This could represent the Father President’s quarters where the survivors gathered
and defended themselves for a time before moving into the chapel (Nathan and
Simpson 2000:85–88).
Several soldiers appear as tiny images within the presidio stockade, along
with three wheeled cannons (A in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1). The cartouche states
that the presidio had a “garrison of one hundred soldiers.” The rest of the soldiers
appear in two groups between the mission and the presidio (Figure 13.15); they are
shown as classic colonial-era soldados de cuera (presidial soldiers equipped with
leather jackets) described and illustrated by de la Teja and Wheat (2004:Figure 1)
(also see Faulk 1971; Moorhead 1968). The upper group is composed of four mounted
horsemen near the “road from the Presidio to the Mission” (B in Figure 13.2 and
Table 13.1). These soldiers are heading toward the presidio, and they have widebrimmed Texcuco hats and carry ardagas (distinctive double-oval shields). One or
Figure
13.15
two appear to be carrying long lanzas
(lances).

are shown in the presidio, a group of four mounted soldiers are riding along the road to the presidio, and

Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission San Sabá Painting
The largest images of Spanish soldiers are three (or more?) mounted soldiers
engaged in combat with mounted Indians as large groups of Indians emerge from
the woods all around them. These are typical soldados de cuera, with the classic
soldado weapons and accouterments (guns, swords, and shields) and the long
cueras (leather jackets) clearly visible on two of them. The scene is described in the
painting’s cartouche as “Fight between the Spanish and the Indians on the road
to the Presidio, where they left three dead, and the rest fled to the Presidio badly
wounded” (J in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1).
It is likely that this scene depicts the events described in the written
testimony of Sergeant Joseph Antonio Flores (Nathan and Simpson 2000:46­–47).
When the presidio soldiers learned of the large number of Indians that arrived at
the mission on the morning of March 16, Colonel Ortiz Parrilla ordered Flores and
eight soldiers to go to reinforce the mission and report the status back to him. After
Flores and his men crossed the river, they encountered large numbers of Indians
along the road before reaching the mission. They could see the mission but had
to stop when the hostile Indians fired on them. Flores reported that three of the
soldiers—Joachín García, Luis Thorino (probably a mistranslation of Chirinos), and
Joseph Vásquez—were shot, and the other soldiers engaged in a running battle as
they retreated. Flores and six of his men, one of whom was wounded, made it back
to the presidio, implying that two dead Spanish soldiers were left behind. Sergeant
Flores reported that, when they visited the mission after the attack, they found the
bodies of Joachín García and Luis Chirinos between the mission and the presidio
and buried them (Nathan and Simpson 2000:56). García and Chirinos are included
in the list of mission casualties compiled by Juan Terreros (2004:624). But a later
deposition by Lieutenant Juan Galván and other noncommissioned officers and
soldiers stated that a later reconnaissance party found the fresh graves of “Lázaro
de Ayala, Joachín García and Luis Chirinos. The last-named were three soldiers
of this Presidio who had been sent to reinforce the Mission” (Nathan and Simpson
2000:65). This statement is likely the source for the Destruction artist stating in
the cartouche that the soldiers “left three dead” in this skirmish.
The deposition statement is incorrect with regard to Lázaro de Ayala,
however. The depositions of Sergeant Flores and Father Molina make it clear
that Lázaro de Ayala was a soldier killed at the mission at the onset of the attack
(Nathan and Simpson 2000:56, 89; also see Terreros 2004:623), and the deposition
of Joseph Vásquez lists the eight soldiers (including Vásquez) in Sergeant Flores’s
reinforcement party and de Ayala was not among them (Nathan and Simpson
2000:80–81). Thus, the written evidence indicates that only two soldiers were killed
in the skirmish between the mission and presidio, and they were probably buried at
the scene of the battle. The third soldier who was wounded and left behind, Joseph
Vásquez, was able to make his way to the mission to join the other survivors who
escaped from the mission, but he died several days later after giving his deposition
on March 21 (Nathan and Simpson 2000:80–83; Terreros 2004:624).
The soldiers in the painting are very similar to the Spanish soldados de
cuera depicted in the Segesser II painting (Hotz 1991:Plates 8, 12, 13, 14). Near its
center, the Segesser II painting has a large group of soldiers forming a defensive

349

350

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
circle (see Hotz 1991:Plate 12). These men have dark brown or white wide-brimmed
hats, knee-length leather coats (cueras), double-oval shields (ardagas), flintlock
rifles, swords, and lances. Hotz (1991:115–125) describes the scene as the “Camp of
the Defenders.” The second group of soldiers is at the far right (Hotz 1991:Plates
13 and 14). One mounted soldier is leading the charge with his spontoon (a type of
lance) leveled at an enemy, and he is just ahead of a group of mounted soldiers and
Indian allies called the “Spanish horse guards.” They all have the characteristics
of the soldado de cuera, including leather jackets, wide-brimmed hats, flintlock
rifles, swords, and shields. Hotz (1991:155–156, 226–230) concluded that the camp
defenders were Spanish soldiers and Indian allies of the ill-fated Pedro Villasur
expedition in 1720s, and subsequent researchers have agreed with this interpretation
(Chávez 1990; Fontana 2000).
Only two of the soldiers depicted in the Destruction painting can be
identified by name. In Father Terreros’s death scene (see Figure 13.9), the naked
man on the right being killed and mutilated by the Indians is probably the soldier
Joseph García. He was accompanying Terreros during the initial stages of the
attack, and Father Molina saw both men get shot near the stockade gate (Nathan
and Simpson 2000:87–88). But García may have survived to fight on for a while.
When the soldiers returned to inspect the mission after the attack, García’s body
was not found near the gate with the remains of the Father President but was
discovered later in the “terrain between the mission and presidio” (Nathan and
Simpson 2000:56).
The second identifiable soldier is a bloody naked man standing alone well
beyond the stockade (see Figure 13.14). This person is described in the cartouche (K
in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1) as follows: “A valiant soldier who, with sword in hand,
defended himself in said battle, killing many Indians. He was impaled through the
chest with a lance, left for dead and stripped; recovering, he walked to the Mission,
where he was thrown on the fire; he escaped from it miraculously and was confessed
before dying.” This man is almost certainly Joseph Vásquez, as confirmed by the
testimony by Vásquez himself and Father Molina (Nathan and Simpson 2000:80–83,
89–90). Vásquez was among the survivors who made it to the presidio, and he was
still badly wounded when he gave his deposition to Colonel Ortiz Parrilla on March
22, 1758. Although not confirmed in any records, subsequent research by Juan M.
Terreros (2004:624) suggests that Joseph Vásquez probably died soon after (see
Table 2.2). Since Vásquez survived the initial attack, the statement in the painting
narrative could only have been relayed to the artist by someone who knew that
Vásquez had died later on.
Spanish Survivors
The final event depicted in the painting is the group of survivors escaping
from the mission to the presidio (Figure 13.16), identified as P and described (see
Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1) as follows: “During the night the remaining soldiers
escaped miraculously, and the women and children passed through the rabble
without being seen.” The image shows 7 adults, 2 children that are walking, and
perhaps 3 small children that are being carried. This is only 12 people, a number

Figure San
13.16Sabá Painting
Chapter 13: The Destruction of Mission

far lower than the number of people
who actually escaped. Sergeant Flores’s
list of 27 people is probably much closer
to reality (see Chapter 2; Nathan and
Simpson 2000:53–54). Father Molina
is not mentioned in the cartouche
statement, but the adult with the long
walking stick was almost certainly
intended to represent the only priest
who survived. No soldiers are obvious
among the adults, although five soldiers
were with the group that escaped. It
is also unclear whether the adults in
this scene represent Apache Indians,
mission Indians, or Spaniards, but
it is likely that all the children were
Spanish.

and striking out for the presidio in the Destruction painting.

THE PAINTING AS AN ARCHEOLOGICAL TOOL
All of the archeological researchers involved in the various phases of the
Mission San Sabá project believe that there is some historical validity to many
aspects of the Destruction painting. They agree that it was intended to show the
events on the day of the attack and that it is accurate in many details. They also
agree that the depiction of mission compound is incomplete and that several major
features mentioned in the testimonials—e.g., the livestock corral, the springs, and
outbuildings between the mission and the presidio—are missing.
The idea that the painting is a visual reflection of the written eyewitness
testimonies of the survivors is not new. The works of Ratcliffe (1991) and White (2000)
leave little doubt that many researchers believe the painting is an accurate reflection
of the historical events. In an oral presentation to the San Antonio Museum of Art
in November 2009, Mark Wolf demonstrated more precisely than ever before the
high degree of correlation between archival records and the details in the painting.
While reading excepts of the eyewitness testimonies, Wolf showed closeup images
of particular details that correspond with each account. He did this repeatedly, each
time demonstrating that the intricate details of the painting depict specific events
precisely as they are described in the written testimonies.
Building on Wolf ’s lead, this chapter has examined the specific meanings
of particular details in the painting that are documented in the written words, as
well as many details that are not recorded in writing and were likely transmitted
to the artist by an eyewitness. This chapter also has examined the painting’s
broader historical significance and offered some new insights into the political and
social symbolism in the painting within an eighteenth-century Spanish colonial
context. This chapter represents the most intensive study of the painting from
this perspective. The painting and the written depositions recorded soon after the
attack are archival documents recorded on different media. As with any historical

352

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
record, it is important to understand the motivation for creation of the painting,
the agenda of its financial sponsor, the cultural biases of the painter, the intended
audience, and the messages embedded in the imagery.
Two of the most important questions addressed in this chapter are whether
the details in the painting match what we see in the archeological record and
whether the painting helps us interpret the physical remains of the mission. Based
on this analysis, it appears that the painting and the archeological record correspond
in many ways. The three lines of evidence—the painting, written records, and
archeology—are complementary and much more robust when considered together.
The archeological investigations, conducted over many years by TTU
and PAI, define many details about the mission compound (the stockade and the
buildings) and the events associated with its destruction. The physical evidence—in
the form of burned daub, artifact concentrations, and intrusive postholes and wall
trenches—enables the identification and delineation of portions of the stockade
and some structures within the compound. But there is still much that remains
unknown, and this analysis of the Destruction painting highlights the possibility
that Spanish-era deposits may still be preserved beyond the perimeter of all the
previous excavations. To the east of the excavation areas, there may be more of the
open courtyard bounded by the eastern wall of the stockade. To the west, there may
be livestock corrals. The critical evidence in these areas, if it survives at all, likely
will be subtle. But it seems certain that there were other elements of the mission
in areas that have not been investigated.

CHAPTER 14: THE SAN SABÁ INVENTORY
OF SUPPLIES: A PACKING LIST FOR AN
EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY SPANISH MISSION
Jennifer K. McWilliams and Douglas K. Boyd

This chapter examines a Spanish document called the Inventory of Supplies,
which was created in 1756–1757 as part of the founding effort for Mission San Sabá.
This document is significant for a variety of reasons, including the following: (1) it
may be the only complete inventory that lists all of the supplies and services that
were purchased and transported to support the initial creation of a Catholic mission
in a remote location in the northern frontier of New Spain; (2) it is the only known
inventory document that pertains to a mission effort in Texas that was financed
entirely by a private individual; (3) it lists the purchase prices for goods and services
that were acquired, providing an unusal snapshot of comparative values and a unique
look at some of the extravagances afforded to this mission effort; (4) because the life
of Mission San Sabá was abruptly terminated after only 11 months, it provides an
unparalleled roster of items that may have entered the archeological record during
the mission attack in March 1758; and (5) it provides a comparative listing for
identifying the objects that were salvaged by the Spanish soldiers who visited the
mission ruins days after the attack. The original Spanish document has been known
for many years, but it was not translated into English until 1995 (Dennis 1995a),
just after the rediscovery of Mission San Sabá. As part of the Prewitt and Associates
(PAI) investigations, portions of the Inventory of Supplies were retranslated by Wade
and McWilliams in 2011. The original Spanish transcription and translation by
Dennis and the retranslation by Wade and McWilliams are presented in Appendix B.
The expedition to establish the missions on the San Saba River was a large
and well-financed endeavor. The group traveled from Mexico City to the San Saba
River, a seven-month journey that included long stops in San Antonio and on the
San Marcos River. One of the official documents for this expedition was the detailed
Inventory of Supplies (or Inventory), created roughly between September 1756 and
April 1757 (Figure 14.1).66
The task of writing the Inventory document was assigned to Father Francisco
de la Santísima Trinidad, a friar from the College of San Fernando de México who
accompanied the expedition from Mexico City to its final destination. Although only
one of the intended missions was built, the Inventory includes supplies necessary for
The document was not titled Inventory of Supplies in the original Spanish record. Rather, the
document begins “Report of the materials bought in Mexico [City], for the act of founding Missions
for the Aforementioned Gentile Apaches, and the expenses to enable the priests [to carry out
this work]; what they were, and their prices, are the following=” (Dennis 1995a:69). In Spanish:
“Memoria de los géneros comprados en Mexico, para el acto de la fundación de Misiones de dhos
Gentiles Apaches, y gastos para avilitar los Religiosos Ministros; que los que son, y sus precios son
los siguintes=” (Dennis 1995b:1).

Chapter 14: The San Sabá Inventory of Supplies
the founding of up to three missions (Weddle 1964:40). More than just an inventory,
the document was intended as a financial accounting of all of the materials purchased
as well as the expenses for provisions used during the trip and the necessary services
such as transportation of the materials and livestock. The founding expedition
consisted of a large mule train that was equipped with everything they would need
to start a mission settlement, dig irrigation ditches, till soil and plant crops, become
a self-sufficient settlement, build a church, and start the long process of teaching the
Apache peoples to become Christians. The expedition group, including the priests
and the neophytes and their families, and the Apache converts that would follow,
would have to survive on their own for at least three years, not knowing if or when
another supply train might come. The Inventory pertains only to the San Sabá
mission effort, and it does not include any information about the accompanying
military expedition intended to establish the presidio nearby. In typical Spanish
fashion, the military and the church efforts were separate, each with its own system
of recordkeeping and financing.
The itemized listing is quite detailed. It includes many entries for essential
goods one would expect to find: more than 1,300 cattle, 180 sheep, and plenty of
flour, corn, and beans. It also lists large amounts of money paid to the foreman of the
mule train and other hired workers who transported all the goods and herded the
livestock. It also includes large quantities of items intended as gifts for the Apache
Indians they sought to convert; these are typical frontier trade items such as 69
dozen large knives, 1,728 necklaces, 300 women’s blouses, and many thousands of
decorative beads. The 1,080 sets of rosary beads listed were to give to the many
Apache converts that were expected. But the Inventory also contains some things
one might not expect to find in a remote frontier settlement, such as 6 pairs of red
stockings, 2 pounds of anise, German linen napkins, and, for the priests, parasols,
garments of fine Chinese silk, and lots of chocolate.
The expedition was privately funded by Don Pedro Romero de Terreros, who
had amassed a fortune in the silver-mining business and had an eye on potential
mining areas in the San Sabá region (see Chapter 2). Terreros was quite charitable
and supported many worthy causes, as was expected of the wealthy men of his
day (Couturier 1975). But Terreros’s philanthropic efforts, especially his funding
of the mission effort, may also have had an ulterior motive of gaining favor with
the king of Spain to secure a nobility title. In one sense, the Inventory was written
for accounting purposes to tally Terreros’s considerable expenses. If the document
eventually found its way into the king’s hands, it certainly would have added to his
status. We may never know if the king saw this document, but Terreros was indeed
awarded a nobility title, of Conde de Regla, in 1768, a decade after the demise of
Mission San Sabá (Bolton 1915:84; Dunn 1914:388; Kicza 2011; Ratcliffe 1991:514;
White 2000:Appendix F).
It is fortunate that the original Spanish text, handwritten on parchment,
not only made the journey across northern Mexico and into remote central Texas,
but made it back safely to Mexico City, where it survived more than two and a half

355

356

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
centuries to be preserved in modern archives.67 Although three mission transfer
inventories have been found and published in translated form, they are different
from a founding inventory. The church made a transfer inventory anytime assets
were shifted from one mission location to another; these were simple inventories
of the property being transferred, without any cost information (and typically
at the end of a failed mission effort). The founding Inventory, on the other hand,
was created as an accounting tool, and it provides information that is rarely
available for the period and that can serve as an extremely accurate record for
interpreting archeological finds. The purchase prices establish a framework for
understanding the relative values of Spanish colonial material culture that would
have been common in all mid-eighteenth-century mission sites. Not only does
the Inventory list the price for every item or group of items purchased and every
service received, but it provides more-detailed descriptions of some of those items
than are available elsewhere. The author was precise in describing some of the
finer things that were acquired. For example, the entries for “6 Albs [white priest’s
gowns] of brabant [fine white linen], good quality with lace” and “2 Spanish table
covers with backing of shag [velvet-like material]” are far more descriptive than
anything in the mission transfer inventories. These details probably were deemed
necessary if the benefactor’s intent was to justify the expenses and document the
high quality of the items being bought.
DOCUMENT HISTORY AND RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Although previous researchers (Herbert Eugene Bolton, William Edward
Dunn, and Carlos Eduardo Castañeda) clearly had access to the Spanish manuscript,
Dr. Phil Dennis (1995a) was the first to translate the Inventory document. It was
published in 1995 in conjunction with the Texas Tech University archeological
investigations (Hindes et al. 1995). McWilliams (2001) conducted the first extensive
research on the document between 1997 and 2001, comparing the item-by-item
descriptions to mission artifacts recovered by TTU during the 1997 field season.
This chapter presents a reanalysis. It builds on the initial translation by Dennis
(1995a) and the previous analysis by McWilliams (2001). But this chapter represents
a significant expansion of that earlier effort. It considers the history of the Inventory
(who created it, why it was created, and where it went through time) and its
historiography (how historians have used the document through time and their
methods). As part of this study, Dr. Maria Wade and McWilliams undertook a limited
retranslation of the Inventory. This involved updating and revising translations of
many Spanish words and phrases relative to the original Dennis (1995a) translation.
This chapter interprets the Inventory within a broader historical context provided
by other archival records and with reference to the archeological findings from the
mission.

Microfilm copies of the original Spanish document are housed in the Old Spanish Research
Library, Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, Texas (Dennis 1995a:69). It is listed as
“Microfilm of the Celaya Archives, Roll 9.”

Chapter 14: The San Sabá Inventory of Supplies
Appendix B provides all of the key documents used in the retranslation and
reanalysis:
•

A facsimile of the original handwritten Inventory of Supplies from the
Celaya Archives at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio;

•

The original Spanish transcription and translation by Phillip Dennis in
1995 with a retranslation and research notes by Wade and McWilliams
in 2011 (Table B.1);

•

A reorganized accounting list of all the entries in the Inventory organized
into functional categories (Table B.2);

•

A list of items salvaged after the mission attack, written four days later
by Colonel Ortiz Parrilla and translated and published by Dr. Kathleen
Gilmore (1967:37–43). Minor retranslations and new annotations have
been added to this list by Mariah Wade (Table B.3);

•

A glossary of selected Spanish terms with English translations.
McWilliams compiled the glossary, but it includes definitions from
many different researchers and sources.

In Tables B.1 and B.2, a line number is assigned to each line of entry in
Dennis’s (1995a) original published translation. McWilliams (2001) assigned line
numbers for the first Inventory study, and this format is followed here as well.
However, some minor discrepancies in the original line number assignments have
been corrected, and the final line number assignments in this retranslation do
not correspond exactly to those presented by McWilliams (2001:Appendix B). The
retranslation in Table B.1 contains 498 lines of entry plus a few partially illegible
lines at the end of the document. References to specific Inventory items throughout
this chapter are cited as “see Appendix B, Table B.1, line x.”
Table B.2 was created to facilitate the research on the materials brought to
the mission. Finding specific items in the Inventory proved difficult because of its
length and the variety of materials and items listed. In some cases, multiple items
were listed on single lines, and entries for identical and similar items were sometimes
scattered throughout the Inventory. This made it difficult to look for specific types
of items, such as carpentry tools, in the verbatim translations. The solution was to
create a tabular listing of all of the specific objects that could then be sorted into
functional categories to aid in the analysis. The result was Table B.2, which should
benefit future researchers as well.
Many of the old Spanish words and phrases mentioned in this chapter
and in the Appendix B tables and glossary are defined using eighteenth-century
Spanish dictionaries available online through the Royal Spanish Academy, or Real
Academia Española. These dictionaries were accessed between May 2010 and March
2011 at http://buscon.rae.es/ntlle/SrvltGUILoginNtlle. When citations for these
online dictionaries are presented in this chapter, they appear in the format: (Real
Academia Española 1762–1992:A 1732:629, 1). This example refers to a particular
1732 dictionary published online by the Real Academia Española.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Historical Geography and Timeline
The Inventory provides important information relating to the historical
geography of the Spanish northern frontier in the eighteenth century. Figure 14.2
shows key place names on a historic map of Mexico, while Figure 14.3 details the
approximately 1,000-mile route that the supply train took from Mexico City to the
San Saba River.
The Expedition and the People
Two expeditions left from Mexico City. One included the religious personnel
with the mission supply train, and the second, the military party, was headed by
Colonel Ortiz Parrilla and included his troops and supplies. Father Terreros, leader
of the religious expedition, chose priests from the two colleges outlined in Don Pedro
Terreros’s financial offer: the Colleges of Santa Cruz in Querétaro and San Fernando
in Mexico City (White 2000:Appendix D). Each of these colleges planned one primary
mission and other additional missions over the next ca. 20 years. In addition to
Father Terreros, the members of the religious expedition included Fathers Joaquín
de Baños and Diego Ximénez from the College of Santa Cruz and Fathers José
Santiesteban and Juan Andrés from the College of San Fernando. Father Francisco
de la Santísima Trinidad joined the group later but before they reached San Antonio
(Castañeda 1936:394–401; Dunn 1914:391; Weddle 1964:43–44). Additionally, nine
Tlaxcaltecan Indian families were picked up in Saltillo (Dennis 1995b:81; Dunn
1914:391). Father Benito Varela and possibly four Indian families joined the group
in San Marcos. The religious expedition may have included an unknown number
of Indian servants and certainly a fair number of muleteers and drovers who were
hired to transport the supplies and livestock.
The Inventory of Supplies never mentions a military escort for the mission
expedition, but other documents indicate it did have one. In the “Revenge of the
San Saba” document written in 1758, Father Trinidad stated that Colonel Ortiz
Parrilla divided his command in San Marcos, and he and most of his soldiers
accompanied the five priests and their supply train on their final journey to the
San Saba River (Dennis 1995b, 1995c:81–82, #20–23). Although the military group
would have traveled along with the mission expedition, they would have camped
separately and used their own provisions. The “Revenge” document indicates that
part of Parrilla’s command stayed behind in San Marcos with two priests. These
men were presumably Fathers Juan Andrés and Benito Varela, who were probably
the priests assigned to the presidio chapel. The first group made it to San Sabá
by April 1757, and Father Trinidad’s letter indicates that this second group of
soldiers and priests left San Marcos sometime in May and arrived at San Sabá in
June (Dennis 1995c:82, #26, 27).
None of the historic documents give a clear indication of the exact number of
people who accompanied the supply train on its journey. It is presumed that many
of the muleteers and livestock drovers returned to Mexico City and other locations
not long after arriving at the mission site. The original mission expedition group

that journeyed from San Marcos to San Sabá was comprised of perhaps two to three
dozen people,68 including the five priests.
Supply Train Travel
Several entries in the Inventory document that the expedition used pack
animals and mules for its supply train, and that similar mule trains were used to
gather the supplies. One entry notes a payment given to “the animal drivers of the
pack animals” and another payment of 48 pesos to “Thomas Yanez for 2 loads, carried
on his mules to San Antonio, with other household items carried for pack balancing”
(see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 336, 375). Many entries document various payments
for transporting “loads” of supplies and for “harnesses for the loads” (see Appendix
B, Table B.1, lines 321, 328, 362, 422–426, 441–452). One of the last entries in the
document was a notation regarding the payment of 314 pesos “to finish paying the
Foreman of the pack string, Dn Joseph de la Campa, for the rest of the transport
of equipment to S. Antonio” (see Appendix B, Table B.1, line 492). It is unlikely the
expedition had any wagons or carts, since the Inventory contains no expenditures
relating to them.
One of the presido expedition soldiers, Sergeant Joseph Flores, provides
a description of a train in which supplies were transported from San Antonio to
Presidio San Sabá just days before the mission attack; it may apply to the mission
expedition as well. He describes the train as consisting of 100 mules in two strings
of 50 pack animals, with three muleteers to accompany each string (Nathan and
Simpson 1959:59; Weddle 1964:69). Roads were not suitable for wagon traffic, and
mule trains were the only efficient means for transporting supplies. Mules were
especially beneficial in that they could carry heavy loads, navigate rough terrain
and river crossings, and generally traveled 12 to 14 miles each day (Fox and
Ulrich 2008:24). A packed mule can carry up to 250 pounds (Essin 1970), and they
were preferred as pack animals over horses because of their great endurance and
suitability in rough terrain.
History of the San Sabá Expedition
In August 1756, Father Trinidad presumably began preparing the Inventory
and collecting supplies (Table 14.1). The viceroy had accepted Don Pedro’s offer
on August 24, and Father Terreros was officially appointed on September 4, 1756.
When the expedition left Mexico City is not known, but Father Trinidad was
purchasing additional supplies in Querétaro by September 18. The expedition
traveled approximately 260 miles from Mexico City to Querétaro. Based on Fox and
Ulrich’s (2008:24) estimate of the speed of mule-train travel, the route from Mexico
City to Querétaro took about 18–22 days. If the expedition arrived in Querétaro
by September 18, it is likely that they left Mexico in late August and no later than
September 1. However, it is possible that Father Trinidad had ridden ahead of the
mule train and began purchasing supplies in Querétaro and recording them in
This rough estimate is based on the various estimates of the number of people who were at the
mission on the day of the attack. Dunn (1914:404) reports there were 17 people; Weddle (1964:70,
n. 22) estimate 35 people; and Hindes and Wolf (1995:Table 2) list 31 people.

the Inventory several days before the mule train arrived. If they were in a hurry,
this would have allowed supplies to be gathered and readied for loading when the
supply train caught up. Aside from the entries made to the Inventory in Querétaro
on September 18, no other firm dates are stated in the document.
Because the Inventory lists items in order of purchase, and also names places
where they were purchased and some of the places the expedition traveled on the
way to the San Saba River, it can be read as a geographical guide to the journey.
There are some significant gaps in time and space, but it provides a reasonably
accurate map of where the mule train went as it crossed the northern extent of the
Spanish empire in the New World. On the final page of the Inventory, the document
is described as:
…a record of materials purchased, first in the City of México, and
then in Querétaro; and various others which were destined to the
same end, and statement of what was consumed and spent in the
sustenance of the Priests on their journey and their existence with
this destination; on the Servants, payment of transport, and other
costs, of outlays which can be noted in these entries: which it seems
to be, cost the quantity of [21,309 pesos and 6 reales], leaving apart
any possible errors…
The following discussion is organized in the same manner as the Inventory,
with subsection headings being the names of the towns or areas between towns
mentioned by Father Trinidad (e.g., Mexico City, Querétaro, or between Querétaro
and San Antonio). Table 14.2 is a listing of all the Inventory entries that mention
specific places. Most are where supplies or equipment were purchased, but a few are
in reference to payments for services provided such as transportation of livestock
or bulk items to a particular place.
It is assumed that many of the towns named were visited by the entire
expedition. Some are along the main route taken, and they could have been planned
destinations to purchase specific goods or services along the way. Presumably, the
expedition stayed in most of the main towns for at least one night and probably
for several days while the supplies were gathered. The expedition definitely spent
some time in Querétaro and Saltillo. They also spent considerable time in San
Antonio during the winter of 1757, and apparently delayed their final journey to
the San Saba River until the spring. But it appears that some towns listed were
not visited by the entire expedition. It is likely that individuals or scouting teams
with smaller mule trains were sent to pick up supplies in some small towns off
the main route.
The purchase of items along the way probably was necessary, especially to
obtain specialized items from craft production centers, for example, leather goods
in one town and silver in another. An attempt was made to match the towns where
items were purchased to areas of historic craft specialization using George Fay’s
(1962) Arts and Crafts of Mexico, but that publication proved too simplistic for this
level of historic research.

Chapter 14: The San Sabá Inventory of Supplies
At Mexico City
The Inventory begins in Mexico City, but no date is provided. We can assume
it began soon after Father Terreros was formally appointed in early September 1756.
The document starts off explaining that it is a “Report of the materials bought in
Mexico City, for the act of founding Missions for the Aforementioned Gentile Apaches,
and the expenses to enable the priests [to carry out this work]; what they were, and
their prices” (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 1 and 2).
It is clear that Father Trinidad entered items in chronological order, probably
in the order in which they were delivered to him. The Inventory probably lists items
by group or container—e.g., piles, bunches, bundles, boxes—as they were received.
Some items may have been gathered for weeks prior to the formal letter to proceed,
while other materials were probably ordered from various vendors and purchased
as they were delivered to the College.
Most of the ecclesiastic items, carpentry tools, farming tools, and household
items were purchased in Mexico City along with some specialty items such as
medical and tailors’ supplies. Weapons included “2 long Castillian shotguns” and
“16 pounds of gun powder” (see Appendix B, lines 191, 254). These firearms would
have been for the priests or others associated with the church, since equipment for
the presidio is not included in this document
Large quantities of trade items—intended to be given or traded to the Apaches
or mission Indians—also were purchased in Mexico City. These items are easily
identified by their unusually high quantities. They are generally grouped together,
possibly indicating that one supplier provided many of them. They include: 100 comales
(flat tortilla griddles), 12 bunches of glass beads (green and blue), 1,008 fancy necklaces,
720 plain necklaces, 828 large heavy knives (from Cape Guiacan), 300 plain guipiles
(women’s blouses), 6 Tempatlaquas-style blouses for “the head Indian women,” 28 girls’
blouses, 6 Gilotepeque skirts “for the head Indian women,” 8 bunches of seed beads,
wool to make “light jackets for the Indians,” 1080 Tepejiolte rosaries, 288 earrings
“from Spain,” 12 bunches of ordinary seed beads, 20 bunches of garnets, 100 pieces
of “Chinese” ribbon, 24 necklaces “from Spain,” 288 small jingle bells, 288 medallions
(probably religious medallions), 144 rings “from Spain,” 288 “deer-eye” rattles, 30 cloth
caps “for the Indians,” 18 rings with “stones of Bohemia for the Indian princes,” and
288 small brushes (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 71, 185–188, 209–211, 215–228,
256, 265, 277). While the quantities of some items are certain, many of the small items
like beads are grouped into “bunches” of unknown size.
Bulk spices and other culinary items were also purchased in Mexico City, and
they are surprisingly diverse. Spices listed include 2 pounds each of anise, rosemary,
and cumin, and 1 pound. each of saffron, cardamom, cinnamon, and pepper (see
Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 174–181). Culinary supplies also included 14 arrobas
and 20 pounds (370 pounds total) of white sugar, 4 ounces of almonds, and 4 ounces
of cloves “for eating” (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 169, 180, 214). Chocolate was
a major purchase, and in Mexico City alone, 26 arrobas and 8 pounds (658 pounds
total) plus another 7 boxes of unstated size were bought (see Appendix B, Table B.1,
lines 260, 269). Additional chocolate was purchased along the route.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
While the expedition was still in Mexico City, an entry on the fifth
page appears as “Cobre estañado,” which is retranslated as “tinned copper.”
This is followed immediately by a listing of the tinned copper containers,
including pots for holy water, large basins, barbers’ basins, porcelains, and kettles
(see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 127, 129). A few lines later, the entry “Dicho por
estañar” (to be tinned) is followed by a list of items to be tinned, including 22 copper
saucepans or kettles, 40 olla-shaped pots or bowls, 2 large kettles, 6 small caldrons
or kettles, and 2 warming pans (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 133–138). Tinning
was a process in which iron or copper cooking vessels were coated with tin to protect
them or make the foods cooked in them taste better. A 1732 Spanish dictionary (Real
Academia Española 1762–1992:A 1732:628, 2) has two entries for Cobre estañado.
One defines it as “Estanar piezas hechas de hierro ù cobre porque los preserva del
herrin” which translates as “iron or copper items covered in tin because tin protects
those metals from rusting.” A second entry states: “El estáño puesto como bano en
los vasos de cobre hace en ellos mas agradable sabor,” which translates as “A cover
[bath] of tin on copper vessels makes the food cooked in them better tasting” (Real
Academia Española 1762–1992:A 1732:629, 1).
At Querétaro
After 286 entries of initial supplies purchased in Mexico City, the Inventory
moves on to record purchases made in Querétaro. These begin on September 18,
1756—which is the only date actually recorded for entries made in the supply list
(see Appendix B, Table B.1, line 288). The supplies were similar to those obtained
in Mexico City, but they seem to consist largely of travel supplies, and the entries
commonly specify for use “on the road” (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 340, 355,
360). Additionally, the acquisition of pack animals and packing materials suggests
that Querétaro was the last place to obtain many items. Given its location, it was
also a logical starting point for long journeys heading northward. The purchases were
quite varied (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 288–375). They include ironwork and
leather goods (for saddles, tents, box corners, and bookstands), numerous saddles,
shodding for 22 mules, bits, harnesses, headstalls, sheep shears, and additional mules
(both saddle and cargo mules) and horses. Food items purchased include 75 pounds
of rice and 18 trays of sweets (probably candies). Additional supplies include 1,250
pounds of soap and 17 large pieces of leather for cots. Trade items were specified as
“for the Indians” and included 133 and 1/2 varas of cloth (a vara is about 33 inches)
and 302 varas of wool sackcloth (presumably for making clothing), 270 blankets,
and 108 ordinary69 hats (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 314, 319, 335, 366).
It appears that the group may have purchased some basic supplies—such
as “17 pieces of leather for sleeping [beds],” “2 dozen big and small [metal] vessels,”
and “4 horseman’s saddles” (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 329, 330, 333)—that
they could have obtained in Mexico City. Although it is not stated, it is possible
that they forgot some needed items in Mexico City, or perhaps a few days on the
road may have made them realize they needed more supplies or particular items.
As used in the Inventory, “ordinary” seems to refer to items that were plain. But the term is
only used with trade items (hats, beads, and necklaces) for the Indians.
69

Chapter 14: The San Sabá Inventory of Supplies
Alternatively, the group may have planned to purchase some bulky items—like “3
arrobas of rice,” “50 arrobas of soap,” or “270 blankets for the Indians” (see Appendix
B, Table B.1, lines 325, 335, 342)—in Querétaro, perhaps because they knew they
would be available or would be less expensive there.
A large number of purchases made in Querétaro were specifically for the
priests, including 2 pairs of trousers, 2 parasols, 1 horse, 2 cargo mules, iron trimming
for a small trunk, 3 harnesses for the loads, 37 varas of frieze cloth, ironwork for a
saddle and cinch, 16 varas of linen for making surplices (religious tunics), making
of 4 surplices and 6 shirts, 4 pairs of ramrods (for muzzle cleaning), 4 horsemen’s
saddles, unspecified “necessities of the Priests on the road,” and 4 small basins of
tinned copper (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 298–348). Perhaps the purchase of
the parasols70 for Fathers Terreros and Santiesteban is evidence the journey was
beginning to weigh on the priests (see Appendix B, Table B.1, line 300). An additional
8 arrobas (200 pounds) of chocolate designated “for the Priests on the road” were
added as well (see Appendix B, Table B.1, line 355).
From Querétaro to San Antonio
When the expedition left Querétaro, it was headed for San Antonio (see
Appendix B, Table B.1, line 382). The Inventory lists a number of towns where
additional items were purchased between Querétaro and San Antonio. The towns
mentioned are: Dolores (also known as Dolores Hidalgo), equipment for an animal
driver; San Philipe, ca. 300 pounds of flour; Las Gallinas, a horse for Father Terreros;
Saquina Seca, 8 horses and 2 cargo mules; Arroyo Seco, a butchered beef for the
animal drivers; Matehuala, a ram for the supply train driver to eat; Castaño (near
Monclova), an ox for the animal driver to eat, and Rio Grande del Norte, animals
butchered and other food. The towns do not appear in strict geographic order from
south to north, and thus it is likely that the purchases were made while the group
was in one or two of the larger towns. It appears that the expedition stayed in
Saltillo for a time, so it probably served as a central hub while runners were sent
out to other places to procure specific items.
While the expedition was in Saltillo, they acquired 8 cargas (about 2400
pounds) of wheat, consisting of both lower- and higher-quality grain, a load of flour
(250–300 pounds), and a riding mule for Father Terreros. Two butchered cows and
a ram for the priests were the only provisions purchased. Also, four loads (roughly
3,500–4,200 pounds) of lime are listed out of order (prior to leaving Querétaro) for
reasons unknown, so it is not certain whether the purchase was made in Querétaro
or Saltillo. While in Saltillo, the expedition also added “nine families of Tlaxcaltecan
Indians…obtained to be used as instructors for the neophytes” (Castañeda 1936:394;
Dunn 1914:391). These Indians are also mentioned in Trinidad’s ca. 1758 Revenge
of the San Saba, but they are called “nine families of Indians of the old Missions”
(Dennis 1995b:81). These Indian families are mentioned in the Inventory only in
These items are listed as “2 cueros de sol de pieles de benado curtidas.” This phrase was
originally translated as “2 cured, sun dried deerskins” but was retranslated as “2 skins of the
sun” or parasols. U.S. Army Captain Randolph B. Marcy observed Comanche Indians carrying
“skin umbrellas” in north-central Texas in 1853. This would likely have been the same kind of
umbrellas as mentioned in the Inventory.

the context of a payment made for transportation “of corn for the sustenance of the
Padres, Servants, and the Indian families who were taken from the Missions to
instruct the Apaches in the working of the fields” (see Appendix B, Table B.1, line 422).
The Inventory contains no entries from the last purchase made at Saltillo
until the expedition arrived in San Antonio (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 402–
408). Although this segment represents more than a third of the journey, it is not
surprising that no supplies were obtained along this sparsely populated portion of
the route.
At San Antonio
The priests and the mission supply train arrived in San Antonio in December
1756, followed a few days later by Ortiz Parrilla with his military troops and supply
train (Trinidad 1758 as translated by Dennis 1995b, No. 2; Dunn 1914:391). The
arrival of the group is signaled in the Inventory by an entry that reads “Expenses
incurred from San Antonio to the San Marcos River” (see Appendix B, Table B.1,
line 408). The majority of the entries written while in San Antonio pertain to
purchasing livestock and payments made for the care of livestock (see Appendix
B, Table B.1, lines 408–432). The purchases include 1,005 cattle from Mission of la
Bahía del Espíritu Santo, 300 cattle from Mission San José, 180 sheep also from
Mission Espíritu Santo, 7 cows and 5 bulls from residents of the Villa San Fernando
and other unnamed villas, 38 gentle plow oxen from Mission Purísima Concepción
(n = 20) and residents of an unknown villa (n = 18), and 14 horses from Missions
San José (n = 10) and San Xavier (n = 4).
Many bulk provisions were also purchased in San Antonio. These total 18,300
pounds of corn, with 25 cargas (7,500 pounds) purchased from the Presidio of San
Antonio, plus 33 cargas (9,900 pounds) and 3 cargas of pinole (900 pounds of ground
corn) from unknown sources. Three cows were purchased and made into dried, salt
meat (cezina or jerky). Assuming the live weight of a cow was 1,000 pounds, its
carcass weight would be about 590 pounds (approximately 59 percent of live weight),
and the dried jerky weight would be about 150 pounds (approximately 25 percent
of raw meat weight). This would translate to a total of about 450 pounds of jerky.
The Inventory also notes two instances where 66 pesos were paid for the transport
of large quantities (33 loads each time) of food and equipment for use by the priests,
their servants, and the neophyte Indians who had joined them.
In his agreement to sponsor the San Sabá missions, Don Pedro Terreros
agreed to purchase the church property from the San Xavier Missions that were
being abandoned (White 2000:223). The latter were abandoned about 1755–1756,
and all the church property (supplies and religious articles) was sent temporarily
to a location on the San Marcos River before being transferred in 1756 to another
temporary location of the mission called San Francisco Xavier, near the modern city
of New Braunfels (Chipman 2010c; Supplee 2010). The transfer to the San Sabá
missions was to have happened in San Antonio, but politics came into play because
Father Dolores, president of the San Antonio missions, harbored negative feelings
toward Father Terreros. Father Dolores was not willing to comply with this condition

Chapter 14: The San Sabá Inventory of Supplies
(Dunn 1914:390, n. 11), and it appears that the four horses mentioned above may
be all that the San Sabá group obtained from the abandoned San Xavier Missions.71
The San Sabá expedition stayed in San Antonio from December 1756 to
March 1757. This long stay may have been intentional. It is unlikely that the group
would have wanted to travel northward during the coldest months in Texas, and
they probably planned to stay in San Antonio until early spring before continuing
the journey.
From San Marcos to the San Saba River
After the last entry made in San Antonio, the next entry is the heading: “Expenses
incurred from San Marcos to San Sabá and others” (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines
431–436). The expedition stayed in San Marcos for about a month, from sometime in
March until April 9, 1757. Colonel Ortiz Parrilla may have intentionally delayed the
start of the expedition as Father Trinidad later accused him of doing. But Trinidad
also notes that the reason the Captain moved his command to San Marcos in March
was because of “the lack of pasture in the San Antonio Missions and surrounding
areas” (Trinidad [1758] as cited in Dennis [1995b:81]). During the winter of 1757,
it is likely that livestock forage was scarce around San Antonio, especially because
the San Sabá expedition was amassing large herds of horses and cattle. It is possible
that an experienced military commander might not have wanted to embark on a
long journey until the horses and cattle had time to graze in the early spring and
recover from the lean winter months.
When the expedition left San Marcos on April 9, 1757, they did not head
straight for the San Saba River. Rather, Colonel Ortiz Parrilla forced the group to
head back to San Antonio and then take a more westerly route (Trinidad [1758]
as translated in Dennis [1995b:79–84]). While Father Trinidad thought this was
yet another delaying tactic, it may have been a wise decision based on Terreros’s
knowledge of the roads and terrain in northern Mexico. Weddle (1964:50) suggests
that “From San Antonio, the expedition followed the established trail to the
Pedernales and Llano Rivers.” The journey from San Antonio to the San Saba River
was roughly 200 miles, and the envoy finally arrived at the site of the proposed
mission eight days later on April 18, 1757.
San Marcos was the last stop for the whole group, and they continued to make
purchases for services and supplies; many related to the purchase and transport of
consumables (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 440–452). Corn was listed multiple
times and totals 97 and 1/2 cargas (ca. 29,250 pounds) plus 1,144 fanegas (ca. 1,716
to 2,950 bushels) bought from farmers at San Fernando and Mission Concepción,
plus 72 almudes (495 dry quarts) for the servants and Indians. Other purchased
rations include 3 cargas of salt (ca. 900 pounds; also written as “12 almudes” equal
Ratcliffe (1991:514, n. 14) states that Romero de Terreros did “in fact, purchase the furnishings
of the San Xavier missions” and cites three sources for this. But a review of these sources suggests
he may have interpreted the statement of intent to purchase as proof it actually happened. No
documents confirm that the San Sabá expedition purchased most of the church property from San
Xavier. In the San Sabá Inventory of Supplies, only the four horses are specifically mentioned as
having come from San Xavier. It is not clear where many of the religious items were purchased
since no sources are listed.

to 83 dry quarts or 6 bushels) from San Antonio, 8 fanegas (ca. 12 to 21 bushels) of
beans, and payments for unspecified amounts of tobacco (230 pesos) and crude brown
sugar (225 pesos). Some of the last purchased items listed in the Inventory were 10
rams, 3 barrels of ironwork that was made into tent stakes at Mission Concepción,
58 pairs of trousers “made for the Apache Indians,” and 19 varas (17 yards) of fabric.
Four payments were made to tailors who made coats, pants, blouses, and skirts for
the Indians (See Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 465­–474).
Before leaving San Marcos, the expedition made many payments to
various people for transporting things to San Antonio and on to the San Saba
River. It appears that there were many teamsters available for hire. The costs
for transportation and related services for the final leg of the journey to the San
Saba River were significant (Table 14.3), exceeded only by the purchase of animal
herds and crop foods. Collectively, the transportation costs totaled 1,997 pesos. The
Inventory contains only 30 entries with costs of more than 100 pesos, and seven of
these are for the last leg of the journey.
The notation relating to the “transport of 5 horses, to take 4 Indian families from the
Missions to San Sabá” suggests that these people may have been mission Indians
from one of the abandoned San Xavier missions who joined the expedition. But if
so, they are not identified in any subsequent San Sabá documents.

Chapter 14: The San Sabá Inventory of Supplies
The last legible sum of costs, inclusive of all of the expenses incurred from
Mexico City to the San Saba River, totals more than 218,800 pesos. But in the final
paragraph, Diego Ortiz Parrilla notes that the total cost of the expedition was 210,309
pesos and 6 reales, “leaving apart any possible errors” (Dennis 1995a:78). He writes:
I also certify that the handwriting of which the aforementioned
entries are composed, and all the rest which is written in this book,
seems to be that of Fr. Francisco de la Santissima Trinidad, who
as the person entrusted with these matters, by the appropriate
permission of his superiors, has kept this accounting and records,
participating also in other matters, in accord with his position, as
far as I can see and understand. (Dennis 1995a:78)
The final purchase listed by Father Trinidad was 57 pesos paid for “19
varas of striped woolen fabric for the adornment and decency of the Altar of the
small chapel in the temporary place used to celebrate the Divine Sacrifice in the
San Saba River” (see Appendix B, Table B.1, line 494). The tone suggests that this
represented more than a utilitarian transaction. It was also a symbol of the higher
purpose of the mission.
After Arriving on the San Saba River
The final pages are illegible and therefore do not provide any information
beyond the San Marcos purchases listed above. The expedition arrived on the San
Saba River in April 1757, and the temporary mission was in working order by May
4, 1757. But the last of the supplies still had not arrived from San Marcos by the
end of June (letter from Father Terreros to Don Pedro Terreros, June 29, 1757; cited
in Weddle [1964:56]). In Trinidad’s 1758 letter titled “Revenge of the Rio San Sabá,”
he explains that he received a letter from a secret friend in San Antonio, who begged
him to leave immediately for a matter of “grave importance” (Dennis 1995b:84).
This letter was signed November 8, 1757 (Dennis 1995b:84), which was the same
month that Ortiz Parrilla put his signature of approval on the Inventory of Supplies
(the actual day is illegible). Father Trinidad left the mission on February 12, 1758,
three months after receiving the secret letter and just 24 days prior to the attack.
When and how the Inventory document got back to Mexico is unknown. It may
have been transported to San Antonio with a supply train, and from there taken to
the Franciscan college in Mexico City in late 1757 or early 1758. Or perhaps Father
Trinidad took it with him when he left the mission in February 1758 and delivered
it personally to his superiors.
DENNIS’S OBSERVATIONS ON HIS TRANSLATION
In the mid-1990s, Dr. Grant Hall and Kay Hindes asked Dr. Philip A. Dennis
of TTU’s Anthropology, Sociology, and Social Work Department to translate the
original Inventory of Supplies(Dennis 1995a). Dennis, a cultural anthropologist who
specializes in the Miskito Indians in Nicaragua, had translated eighteenth-century
Spanish documents before. It is not known who may have accessed the Inventory
document prior to that, or if any previous researchers drew conclusions from it.

375

376

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Dennis (1995c) also made notes on his observations, which were not published
with his translation, that made important observations and help place the Inventory
in its proper historic perspective. He noted the strong differences between items
intended for ordinary Indians and those for the “Indios principes” and further stated
that the priests were bringing their European hierarchy with them to Texas. Three
of the more significant statements he made are:
The inventory shows how well financed the outfit was. They
apparently spared no expense for travel supplies or food… One
indication of their wealth is the 170 p. worth of equipment donated
to the animal drivers and servants, as reward for their services
(p. 9, bottom). The tools and religious paraphernalia and livestock
must have seemed like a fortune. It must have been a windfall to
the merchants who equipped and supplied them. From the local
Indian peoples’ point of view, the priests and their servants must
have seemed incredibly rich. Did fame of their wealth spread
through Texas? Did this have anything to do with the attack and
presumably the looting of the mission?
The priests liked their luxuries. They brought along spices to cook
with… (p. 5, middle). They also had almonds, crystal glasses and
cushions. Of course, the priests slept in beds (not on the ground as
their servants probably did). They bought two cargo mules just to
carry the priests’ beds (p. 8, bottom).
Everything is carefully noted down, chronologically, good Spanish
colonial style. 5-reale purchase of tinder with which to start fires
(p. 6, top) is noted in the same way as the purchase of 1005 head
of cattle for 5,025 pesos (p. 12, top). The inventory is in such
painstaking detail that it’s reasonable to assume that anything
found archaeologically at the site (except for personal effects) would
have been recorded here.
He also made note of human errors within the Inventory, especially
inaccuracies in mathematical calculations. For one entry, he noted that 300 head
of cattle were bought for five pesos a head. This should total 1,500 pesos spent, but
Trinidad wrote 10,500 pesos—a discrepancy of 9,000 pesos. In the next entry, 1,005
cattle were purchased for five pesos a head. Rather than the correct calculation of
5,025, Trinidad wrote 50,250 (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 411, 412). In another
entry, he observed that 1,000 fanegas of corn were purchased at 2 pesos per fanega;
this should have totaled 2,000 pesos, but Father Trinidad recorded 20,000 pesos,
creating a huge discrepancy of 18,000 pesos. These mistakes are added into the final
total, and Colonel Ortiz Parrilla did not catch these errors when he signed off on
the document in November 1757. He stated that the total expenditure was 210,309
pesos, whereas page 13 of the accounting ends with 180,922 (Dennis 1995a:77). In
response to this large discrepancy, Dennis (1995c) asked, “What’s going on here?”
Another Spanish researcher, Maria Matz (personal communication 1999), suggested
that the mistakes might have been deliberate errors.72 While this is just a theory,
these inaccuracies could have allowed the mission project to obtain more money
than was actually spent.
Maria “Charo” Matz was a member of the 1997 TTU excavations and a graduate student in
Spanish at Texas Tech University when McWilliams was conducting research on the Inventory.
72

Chapter 14: The San Sabá Inventory of Supplies
Dennis observed that much of the language used by Trinidad in the Inventory
implies negativity towards the Indians’ status. Dennis (1995c) wrote:
Some indication of the disdain with which the rich European
priests seem to have looked at local Indians occurs here and there.
For example, on p. 15, bottom, [Trinidad] notes that corn was given
away to the Apache, in spite of their rejection of the proposed
Reducíon. Plenty of “maritatas” or shiny geegaws like beads and
cheap necklaces (p. 5) and earrings (p. 6) and hats (p. 7) had to be
given out to attract them and bring them in. The high quality stuff
of the priests’ use, of silk and fine material, contrast with all the
trade goods they were carrying to bribe what they consider ignorant
Indians.
And finally, Dennis (1995c) made an important observation regarding
possible sociocultural biases on the part of researchers. He felt that his views
might be swayed at times by his “modern-day value judgements.” Matz (personal
communication 1999) agreed, stating that it is easy to condemn the Spanish for
their attitudes toward the Indians and their social extravagances, but this is an
ethnocentric view. Without better knowledge of the nature of the interactions
between the Spanish military, the Catholic clergy, and the Native peoples, is it fair
to pass judgement on events that happened more than 250 years ago?
MCWILLIAMS’S (2001) ANALYSIS OF THE INVENTORY
One focus of McWilliams’s (2001:112–133) M.A. thesis was a comparison of
artifacts from the 1997 TTU excavations with the nonperishable items listed in the
Inventory. To begin the research, she first entered the Inventory into a database that
enabled searches within the 1,382 entries: 417 item entries with cost information,
plus material type (e.g., ceramics, metal, fabric) and functional classifications. She
expanded this database by adding identifications of all the artifacts recovered during
the 1997 TTU field season and items salvaged from the mission immediately after
the attack, from Gilmore’s (1967:37–43) translation of this list.
To facilitate a comparative analysis of the historical and archeological data,
McWilliams organized items in the Inventory into the following functional categories:
ecclesiastic; carpentry; culinary; animal husbandry; apparel; adornment; and defense
and hunting supplies (McWilliams 2001:112–133). After analyzing the data, it was
clear that there was considerable overlap between the archeological materials and
the items described in the Inventory. However, there also were hundreds of items
listed in the Inventory that did not appear in the archeological record, probably
because they were destroyed in the mission attack, were looted by the attacking
Norteños, or were carried off by subsequent visitors to the mission site.
In McWilliams’s examination of the Inventory and its utility for interpreting
the archeology, she relied on the first Inventory translation by Dennis (1995a). But
in the process, she discovered some minor translation errors that had affected some
of the interpretations. One example of this, excerpted from McWilliams (2001:127),
is presented below:

An entry in the San Sabá inventory reads “24 dozenas de ojos de

deer eyes covered with tin” (Dennis 1995a:73). Rather than directly
translating ojo de benado as an actual deer eye, I believe it is a phrase
describing a large, brown and black seed that resembles the eye of
a deer, as it is commonly called in modern Spanish. The seed comes
from Thevetia sp., a plant from the Apocynaceae or Dogbane family.
Varieties of this species are common to areas in Florida, Central
and South America. Of particular interest is Thevetia nitida which
is reported from Tabasco and the Yucatan (Standley 1924:1153).
The oil from these seeds is poisonous and if taken internally cause
vomiting, breathing restrictions, and heart paralysis (Standley
1924:1153). Indian tribes of Mexico used the Thevetia plant
medicinally. Aztecs used the leaves or juice for deafness, skin
diseases, ulcers, and toothaches. Some tribes reportedly carried
seeds in their pockets to prevent hemorrhoids (Standley 1924:1153)
and some tribes used the seeds as rattlesnake anti-venom (Standley
1924:1152). Interesting to this study, Standley (1924:1152) reported
that Indians in this area wore the seeds around their ankles as
rattles in certain dances.
I believe that the seeds were covered or wrapped in tin to produce
a rattling sound. These rattles could be used as trade items in
areas where the plant or seed was not common. In this particular
case, the seed would have been perishable, but the tin wrapping
would have remained at the site. Ideally, I would have located tin
from the artifact collection and recognized the unique shape of the
seed around which it was wrapped. The collection contains large
amounts of “scrap” and unidentified metal. Unfortunately no exact
or flattened pieces were identified.
Examples like this led McWilliams to realize that there was still much to be
learned from the Inventory document and that a more-comprehensive retranslation
could be helpful in future attempts to interpret the archeological findings. The
proposed expansion of FM 2092 provided the opportunity to continue this work six
years later.
The expedition to establish Mission San Sabá was well financed and well
provisioned (e.g., Dunn 1914:387–388), even to the point of being lavish (as noted
by Dennis [1995c]). The agreement made by Don Pedro Terreros “enabled the work
to be carried out upon an unprecedented scale, and the missions instead of being a
heavy burden of finances of the crown, would entail comparatively slight additional
expense” (Dunn 1914:388; White 2000:Appendix D). “Father Terreros was given a
free hand in the buying of supplies for the mission,” and he purchased “large stocks
of provisions, including luxuries for the priests and trinkets for the Indians” (Dunn
1914:391).
The Inventory contains mundane and utilitarian items but also many
expensive and extravagant items. For example, many fine textiles are listed. Baietas
describes a baized flannel, bramante is a type of linen, bretaña fina is fine linen,
estambre is a worsted woolen yarn, liston batido is a lustrous silk ribbon for the
priest’s habits, and several words refer to different types of silk or silk-like material—

Chapter 14: The San Sabá Inventory of Supplies
persiana, seda, sedazo, and zeda (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 23, 48, 152, 153,
200, 318, 326; Dennis 1995a:85–88). Individual prices are not given for many of
the finer fabrics because they are listed in large groups of religious paraphernalia
that were apparently purchased as sets (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 13–24
and 44–59). Expensive fabrics are also indicated by use the word florete, which
means very white and fine quality. The items described using this word were (see
Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 13, 65): 6 Alvas debremante florete fino con encajes (6
Albs [white priest’s gown] of brabant [fine white linen], good quality with lace); and
2 piezas de cotense florete con 74 1/2 v. a 3 3/8 r. (2 pieces of coarse white woolen
material with 74 1/2 varas at 3 3/8 reales). The word florete is also used to describe
reams of white paper that were probably of higher quality than ordinary paper: 3
resmas de papel florete a 30 r. (3 reams of white paper at 30 reales) (see Appendix
B, Table B.1, line 208).
The quality of the church paraphernalia was a particular priority. To discern
the relative value of the religious items, one need only look at some of the associated
payments. The first group of religious objects, recorded in 11 entries, included 2
lustrous ribbons and 4 cords for the priests’ albs (gowns), 8 chalice and paten cloths
(patens are dishes for eucharistic bread), and 6 sets of each of the following items:
linen albs (priest’s gowns), linen habits, fine lace altar cloths, fine linen double altar
cloths, fine linen covers for chalices and ciboriums (sacred cups), fine linen covers
for patens, altar cruets (wine and water vessels), and purifier cloths (for wiping
the chalice; see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 13–25). These 68 fabric items cost 198
pesos. The second group of religious items, also recorded in 11 entries—composed
of high-quality Chinese and Spanish fabric, mostly fine silk clothing for the priests
and religious services—cost 844 pesos and 4 1/2 reales (see Appendix B, Table B.1,
lines 48–59). To illustrate the point, 844 pesos also bought 10 mules and 5 harnesses
(275 pesos), 180 sheep (225 pesos), 3 loads of salt (54 pesos), and 144 fanegas of corn
(288 pesos), with two pesos to spare (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 313, 414, 450,
488). Without doubt, the finest and most expensive objects were the religious service
items, priests’ clothing, and other ecclesiastic trappings. Many of these were exotic
items made outside Mexico.
Color played an important role in the Catholic liturgy, and color descriptions
are common in the Inventory. The Catholic church began to regulate colors for the
hierarchy as early as 1200 (Noonan 1995:283). The modern vesture colors are white,
scarlet, amaranth, red, purple, violet, black, and green. Saffron and gray were also
used in the past. Particular colors were associated with religious holidays such as
Christmas, Easter, and Lent. To people raised in the traditions of the church, the
significance of such colors would have been instantly understood. The Inventory
records an extensive collection of various colored albs, chasubles, sashes, and cords,
suggesting that the missionaries wore these items often and in rotation, just as
Catholic priests do today.
The color descriptions convey not only religious meaning but in some cases
may refer to relatively expensive items. For example, Trinidad lists “6 pares de medias
de Toluca, teñidas de grana para los Capitanes” (6 pairs of Toluca stockings, dyed

379

380

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
with cochineal for the Captains) (see Appendix B, Table B.1, line 173). Cochineal is
a long-lasting carmine dye obtained from an insect (Dactylopius coccus), and the
dye was an important product of Mexico. Father Trinidad was not only intending to
be descriptive when he wrote this. He could have simply called them red stockings,
but he understood that the word “cochineal” had specific connotations. Not only did
it indicate a dye with a unique deep reddish-purple color, it probably had a deeper
symbolic social meaning to his contemporaries. A modern analogy would be the use
of the word “sedan” vs. “Cadillac.” One is a generic type of automobile, while the
other is a specific model that implies fine quality and social status. However, the
subtle meanings of such words are specific to time and place, and because these
meanings change through time, their original meanings are easily lost.
The Inventory lists precise weights and measurements of various items,
such as 133 and 1/2 varas of cloth, half a pound of matches, 2 gross of earrings,
2 libras (pounds) of anise, and 3 arrobas of rice (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines
174, 205, 219, 314, 325). Various authors have published historical equivalents of
these weights and measurements, and a table of these calculations is provided here
(Table 14.4). The Spanish sometimes used terms like cargas (loads), piezas (pieces),
and mazos (bunches) (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 185, 223, 357). These terms
are most commonly used in conjunction with bulk items, but these quantities seem
imprecise in comparison with their other measurements. If such terms had moreprecise meanings in the mid eighteenth century, they are lost to us today. Thus, we
have no idea how many beads would have been in 12 bunches.

Chapter 14: The San Sabá Inventory of Supplies
Linguistic Observations
The Inventory documents subtle changes in the Spanish language during
a critical period when the cultures began to blend. One of the first steps in the
missionization process was to teach the Spanish language to the Native peoples
(Bolton 1917:56; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969:141). Nevertheless, language posed a
major obstacle. As Bolton (1917:55) notes, “just as the natives lacked the concepts,
the Indian languages lacked the terms in which to properly convey the meaning of
the Christian doctrine.” New words had to be created and adopted by both parties
to convey new concepts, as well as names for everyday things. The Spanish readily
adopted words for unfamiliar places, geographic features, and plants from Native
American vocabularies. The Inventory entry “21 libras de pita azul torcida a p.”
(21 pounds of twisted blue agave thread at a peso) is one example (see Appendix B,
Table B.1, line 147). It is likely that the word pita, meaning agave, would not have
existed in the Spanish language because this plant was not present in the Old World.
In addition to the blending of languages, the Inventory represents a phase in
the evolution of the Spanish language itself. Languages evolve on their own through
general use, but they also change as a result of technological innovation. Many words
and concepts appeared along with new technologies and disappeared as new ones
came into use. Some entries in the Inventory, such as horseshoes and candlewick
trimmers, represent tasks that are uncommon today but still well understood.
But other technologies have disappeared entirely, and misinterpretations in
translation are easily made. For example, the translation of the word tejas as “tile”
led researchers to believe that the San Sabá chapel was covered with a ceramic tile
roof (Nathan and Simpson 1959:95). Based on this translation, Gilmore (1967:26)
expected to find roofing tile at the mission site. Because none were recovered in the
chapel area during the TTU investigations, the only reasonable explanation is that
the true meaning of the word teja is not yet understood.
Global Trade Network
The Inventory also provides a window into the global trade network that
existed long before the industrial age. As shown in Table 14.5, items listed came
from as far away as Spain, China, and Germany. Many exotic items were for the
religious activities of the priests. Of the first 11 religious items listed (see Appendix
B, Table B.1, lines 39–65), 8 were made in Spain or probably made in Spain (including
fancy damask chasubles, tablecloths, leather, tailors’ scissors, and jewelry), 10 were
made in China (including embroidered ribbon, silk chasubles, capes, and sashes for
the priests, and marriage cloths, forks, and two elaborate boxes for holding sacred
wafers), and 1 item was from Germany (linen tablecloths, presumably intended for
the dining of the priests and dignitaries).
It is likely that some of the exotic items listed, such as anise, rosemary, cumin,
pepper, saffron, cinnamon, and cardamom, were originally from the Mediterranean
or Asia (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 174­–181). In addition, some of the trade
beads for the Indians may have been imported. Venetian beads were commonly
exported to the New World as early as the fifteenth century (Deagan 1987:158),

381

382

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
although cargo lists from Spanish vessels indicate that beads were also imported
from France, Germany, and Flanders (Deagan 1987:159). Father Trinidad did not
record the country of origin for the other beads (see Appendix B, Table B.1, lines 185,
216, 220), and these may have been made in European countries other than Spain.

CHAPTER 15: HISTORICAL ARCHEOLOGY AT
MISSION SANTA CRUZ DE SAN SABÁ: SUMMARY
AND CONCLUSIONS
Douglas K. Boyd and Jennifer K. McWilliams

The Prewitt and Associates (PAI) investigations at Mission San Sabá
expanded on the previous intensive archeological work by Texas Tech University
(TTU) archeologists. Rather than interpret the portion of the mission within the
FM 2092 right of way in isolation, we have tried to integrate the PAI data with
the preliminary TTU findings73 as much as possible. The archeological remains,
along with many primary documents and secondary historical sources discussed
in this report, provide a new body of evidence to help interpret the role of Mission
San Sabá within the broader context of Spanish missionization efforts in Texas.
Documentary records, especially the eyewitness accounts of the destruction event
(Nathan and Simpson 2000), certainly play an important role in the analysis of
the archeological data, but the analyses of the 1760s Destruction of San Sabá and
the 1756–1757 Inventory of Supplies provide unusual historical perspectives. They
greatly enhance our interpretations of Spanish and Native American relationships
and interactions and the global reach of the Spanish colonial empire in the mid
eighteenth century.
WHY IS SPANISH COLONIAL
ARCHEOLOGY IMPORTANT?
Historical archeology uses a multidisciplinary approach to understanding
historical events and the lifeways of past peoples. It incorporates many field and
analytical techniques commonly used in prehistoric archeology to contribute to an
overall understanding of an archeological site and the events that occurred there,
but it has the added value of historic records and the perspectives they provide.
Historical archeology also may benefit researchers in other disciplines, including
historians, architects and architectural historians, historical restoration specialists,
anthropologists, and ethnohistorians.
Graham (1998:26) defines mission archeology as dealing not only with the
mission ideal of ecclesiastical units for religious conversion of Native peoples, but
also all aspects of mission life and social interaction. Mission archeology includes
the historical research that leads to the discovery and excavation of mission
sites, and interpreting the combined evidence aids in the understanding of the
historical, demographic, or sociocultural contexts of mission encounters. Graham
Comprehensive analysis and reporting have not been completed for the TTU investigations,
but preliminary results and various aspects of the archeology (especially the material culture)
have been reported.
73

383

384

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
(1998:27) suggests that mission archeology may contribute to many different
research avenues, including:
•

“the role of Christian missionaries in the transformation of nonWestern societies” and the role of the Catholic church in “structuring
new societies in the Americas;”

•

“the contact experience” for Native peoples and Europeans;

•

the lifestyles of “indigenous groups at the time of contact;” and

•

architectural history and the recovery of “information for the
reconstruction of mission buildings” at public sites.

Graham (1998:27) goes on to note that history and archeology are distinct not
for what they research but for the different “methods of investigation (documentary
vs. material cultural) and methods of inquiry (historical vs. anthropological)”
that they employ. Following the lead of Sturtevant (1962:42) and others, Graham
advocates an approach whereby Native American and European interactions and
responses in the contact period are viewed from two different perspectives. In the
past, historians have tended to focus mainly on the “European policies, actions,
and institutions” while anthropologists and archeologists have tended to view the
contact period only in terms of how Native peoples responded to the policies, actions,
and institutions imposed upon them. Fortunately, a greater degree of crossover
between disciplines is becoming the norm. We may all improve our understanding
of the complex relationships between Native peoples and Europeans by looking at
all types of evidence (material culture and documentary) from different vantage
points to achieve “a good balance of perspectives” (Graham 1998:27).
A cautionary note by Graham (1998:29) suggests that “Archaeologists must
be careful not to adopt the simplistic approach of colonial Catholic priests and
interpret the material culture of mission sites as manifestations of either acceptance
or rejection of Christianity.” The Native reactions and responses were complex and
varied, and researchers should seek to define the policies, actions, and institutions
that were developed by different Native American groups during the contact period.
Native peoples responded to mission encounters in a variety of ways, many of which
may be understood as “efforts to thwart domination” or to “fashion an understanding
of, and gain conceptual mastery over, a changing world” Graham (1998:29). While
the historical record of the contact period is certainly biased toward European
viewpoints, historical archeology and a critical analysis of colonial documents can
help reveal Native American perspectives as well.
In our investigations at Mission San Sabá, we have tried to incorporate
multiple lines of historical and archeological evidence to provide the fullest
interpretations possible. In this final chapter, we summarize the highlights of the
project, focusing on what we learned from our archeological investigations of a small
slice at the edge of the mission compound.

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
WHAT MAKES MISSION SAN SABÁ UNIQUE
Mission San Sabá is unique for both its unusual history and unusual
archeology. It represents an unparalleled series of events in Texas history. Seven
factors highlight these qualities:
1. It was privately financed by one wealthy individual rather than the
Spanish crown. This is the only such occurrence in the Spanish history
of Texas, and it is rare in the history of Spanish settlement in the New
World. The fact that it was privately funded means that some of the
material culture was more lavish than that of other missions, but this
is not well expressed by the artifacts recovered, because much of the
material culture was destroyed and removed during the 1758 attack
and by later activities.
2. The 1756–1757 founding Inventory of Supplies details all of the materials
brought by mule train from Mexico City to establish the mission for the
Apaches in the far northern frontier. Supply inventories exist for a few
other missions in Texas, but this is the only founding inventory known
to exist. It describes an elaborate material culture that provides a stark
contrast to the more-austere material culture reflected in the transfer
inventories.
3. The mission survived only 11 months, and it was built as a temporary
mission with a wooden post stockade and buildings constructed of
waddle-and-daub rather than stone. The PAI and TTU investigations
are the only ones conducted on a short-lived temporary mission; most
other Texas mission investigations have focused on more-substantial
structural remains, often stone buildings, associated with settlements
that lasted for many years. The excavations at Mission San Sabá
provide a window into construction techniques during the early stages
of a mission’s establishment.
4. The mission was destroyed in a violent attack on a single day, and
it resulted in the martyrdom of two Catholic priests. Other missions
failed as a result of Native American revolts, and other missionaries
died as a result of their labors in Texas, but never in situations that
compared to what happened at Mission San Sabá. Presidio San Sabá
struggled on and existed as an isolated outpost for another 14 years,
but the destruction of the mission was sudden and complete.
5. Eyewitness accounts were recorded within days of the attack, and these
survived to be discovered, translated, and published as The San Sabá
Papers (Nathan and Simpson 1959; with a reprinted edition in 2000).
They are extremely useful for illuminating the event and interpreting
specific aspects of the mission archeology.
6. The attack on March 16, 1758, was commemorated in a large format
(83x115-inch) oil painting, most likely commissioned and painted in
Mexico City in the early 1760s. This painting, the Destruction of Mission

385

386

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
San Sabá, chronicles the events of that day, serves as a memorial
to those who died, and provides a visual display of the layout of the
mission compound, the buildings, and many details pertaining to the
attacking Indians. Previously recognized only for its artistic rendering,
the Destruction painting is analyzed for the first time in this report
as an archeological tool. The painting is full of hidden meaning; it is
fraught with sociological implications woven into the imagery, including
depictions of weapons that symbolize the French involvement in the
attack and attributes symbolizing social identities of the two main
groups of Indians responsible for the attack. Most importantly, it depicts
specific details that may help interpret the size and configuration of the
mission compound, the structures and features evident in the mission’s
archeological record, and the material culture recovered there.
7. The demise of Mission San Sabá effectively ended the expansion of
Spanish settlement in the northern frontier. After its destruction, the
Catholic church scaled back its efforts to convert the Apache. By 1771,
the Spanish were retreating southward and had abandoned the Apache
mission enterprise altogether.
Following close on the heels of the TTU investigations in the 1990s,
the FM 2092 road-improvement project sponsored by the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) provided an opportunity for an intensive historic
archeological study of this unique place. We did not take this challenge lightly, and
the analyses presented in this volume are an attempt to get beyond the descriptive,
to utilize the historical records and archeological data as fully as possible, to
maximize what might be learned about this particular mission, and to further our
understanding of the complex social interactions between the Spanish and Native
Americans in the middle of the eighteenth century.
SUMMARY OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL PROJECT
The PAI archeological work was concentrated in a long strip of state-owned
land beside FM 2092, and it appears that this area was along the southern edge of
the mission compound. Archeologists found the site in 1993, and subsequent work
by TTU in 1993–1994 and 1997 proved that it is the location of the lost mission
(Hindes et al. 1995). By the end of TTU’s 1997 summer field season, archeologists
had excavated a significant portion of the site on private property north of FM 2092.
PAI’s archeological project was prompted by a road-improvement project in which
TxDOT widened and resurfaced FM 2092s immediately adjacent to the site. Working
for TxDOT, the PAI team conducted archival research, oral history research, and
intensive historic archeological investigations.
The prefield work began in 2005 and consisted of reviewing historic
documents (publications, maps, aerial photographs, etc.) pertaining to the area
along FM 2092 east of Menard, as well as examining historic documents relating
specifically to the mission. The survey phase, which began in the summer of 2006,
focused on the mission location (41MN23), but it included a geomorphological study

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
of Harris Hollow, a remnant channel of the San Saba River. The work at the mission
site included excavation of 19 Gradall trenches and 11 hand-dug test units (8 were
1x1 m and 3 were 0.5x0.5 m). These tests sampled both the north and south sides
of FM 2092, and they served their primary purpose well. They defined where the
Spanish colonial artifacts and features remained intact and where they were most
concentrated, and they revealed areas where no such remains were present within
the state-owned right of way.
No intact deposits were found south of FM 2092. On the north side of the
road, a 3-m-wide strip of intact deposits was found adjacent to the north edge of the
right of way. Road construction and the deeply incised borrow ditch had removed the
remainder of this zone between this strip and the paved road. This this preserved
strip of intact archeological remains was narrow, but it extended laterally (east to
west) for more than 70 m (230 ft), and the testing proved its research potential.
The project moved quickly into the data recovery phase, and one of the
first tasks was examination of primary Spanish documents available in Austin
archives that pertain to Mission San Sabá but had never been translated into
English. Dr. Maria Wade examined and summarized the documents (Wade 2006),
and she then selected 10 for intensive study. This resulted in a report that presents
the handwritten Spanish text, a typed Spanish transcription, and an English
translation (Wade 2007). PAI then developed a data recovery plan to guide the
excavations. PAI also conducted historical research pertaining to the mission and
created a brochure on the history of the Menard Irrigation Company, a nineteenthand twentieth-century agricultural endeavor that expanded the Spanish colonial
acequia at Presidio San Sabá.
The data recovery field investigations ran from November 26, 2006, to
February 9, 2007. This effort included 83 hand-excavated units (79 were 1x1 m, and
4 were 1.0x0.5 m), 6 shovel tests, and two large Gradall blocks. This work recovered
artifacts and documented features associated with the mission occupation within
an area 80-m-long (east to west) and 3-m-wide (north to south). The investigations
recovered 112 Spanish colonial and probable Spanish colonial artifacts, and
documented nine Spanish colonial and probable Spanish colonial features. In
addition, a careful examination was made of the mixed assemblage of chipped
stone artifacts to determine what materials might be associated with the Native
Americans during the mission occupation. Specialized studies were undertaken by
consultants to look at five classes of archeological materials: the faunal remains, the
plant remains, the burned daub, a geochemical sourcing study of the lead artifacts,
and geochemical and mineralogical sourcing studies of selected ceramic artifacts.
Geomorphological Investigation of Harris Hollow
Mechanical trenching was conducted in Harris Hollow at the point where
it passes underneath FM 2092, approximately 1.6 miles west of the mission site.
This work was done to help determine if the Spanish might have intended to use
Harris Hollow for the mission’s irrigation system that was under construction in
1757­–1758. The exposed stratigraphy revealed that Harris Hollow is an abandoned

387

388

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
channel of the San Saba River, and a radiocarbon assay indicates that this channel
began to fill with fine-grained sediment around a.d. 890–1020, or about 800 years
before the mission was established. Based on this, it was inferred that Harris Hollow
was not a viable source of irrigation water for the mission. It is possible, however,
that the acequia that was under construction tapped into the San Saba River and
went across the Holocene terrace and then ended somewhere along Harris Hollow
to direct water back toward the mission and then into the river.
The Mission Artifacts
The PAI investigations recovered 2,442 artifacts. Most are nineteenth- and
early-twentieth-century historic artifacts and modern debris less than 50 years old.
The assemblage includes 651 chipped stone artifacts (stone tools and debitage) that
are considered to be Native-made artifacts of uncertain origin. Some undoubtedly
predate the mission occupation (there is a low density of prehistoric artifacts in many
places along FM 2092), while others could postdate it. An unknown amount could be
associated with the mission occupation and represent lithic tool manufacture and
use by the neophtye mission Indians, visiting Apaches, or even Spanish soldiers.
It is impossible to separate out mission-era stone artifacts with any degree of
confidence, however. Approximately 21 percent of the debitage is moderately (n = 23)
to intensively (n = 103) heated, and many of these specimens may have been altered
during burning of the mission.
The mission occupation is represented by 100 Spanish colonial specimens and
12 probable Spanish colonial items. These artifacts are typical of eighteenth-century
missions in Texas and include: a variety of ceramics; some flat and container glass;
glass beads; lead items (mostly melted blobs); snipe hinges; a knife bolster; iron
spikes, nails and tacks; chain links; and basalt grinding stone fragments. Artifacts
made of local chert include gunflints and strike-a-light flints.
The ceramic assemblage (n = 43) includes Spanish majolicas (Huejotzingo,
Blue on White [probably Puebla], and undecorated), burnished redwares, olive
jar (two styles), and porcelain. In addition, there are Native-made plainwares,
tempered with bone, that represent mission Indian pottery often called Goliad
Ware. Some sherds of salt-glazed stoneware appear to be high-quality Europeanmade stonewares that are associated with the mission occupation (as opposed to
nineteenth-century stonewares deposited much later).
An unusual artifact assigned to the Spanish colonial group is a nearly
complete Perdiz arrow point. It was found, along with a strike-a-light flint, in
association with a Spanish colonial bone cluster (Feature 10) that consists of
fragmentary and butchered animal bones, including cattle and possible sheep or goat
bones. The context suggests that it represents one of the latest dated occurrences
of a Perdiz point in Texas.
Faunal Remains
The excavations recovered hundreds of animal bones that were analyzed by
Brian Shaffer (see Chapter 9 and Appendix D). The remains of skunk, armadillo,

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
and squirrel are obviously modern. But the other 715 bones are classified as Spanish
colonial (n = 218) and probable Spanish colonial (n = 497). Of these, 30 percent
(n = 214) are associated with mission features. Six represent European animals
that were common at Spanish missions: cattle, pig (and probable pig), and sheep or
goat (and possible sheep or goat). One of the probable pig bones has a hand-sawn
butchering mark, and 1 of the possible sheep or goat bones has heavy blade chop
marks. Six other bones, of medium to large mammals and a large artiodactyl, have
butchering marks made by heavy chopping blades or metal knife blades. The eight
bones with butchering marks are elements are vertebrae (axis, cervical, thoracic,
and lumbar), scapulae, and a humerus.
Feature 10 is a cluster of 187 bones with a Perdiz arrow point and a strikea-light flint in close proximity and presumably associated. It may represent a dump
of animal remains that were butchered and consumed by Indians, perhaps Apache
who were visiting the mission or some of the attacking Indians who burned it.
Botanical Remains
Leslie Bush analyzed the botanical remains from 97 screen-recovered
samples and 11 samples recovered by sediment flotation from the PAI work, as well
71 lots of screen-recovered samples from the 1997 TTU excavations (see Chapter
10 and Appendix E). We do not know the precise archeological contexts for the
TTU samples, but these botanical identifications add significant information to
understanding the mission nonetheless.
Because the mission was burned, it is not surprising that wood charcoal and
semicarbonized wood dominate the assemblage. Table 15.1 is a listing of tree species
for which wood charcoal or semicarbonized wood were recovered. It is likely that the
native species include structural woods used in building the stockade and the wattleand-daub structures. Only the wood samples from post Features 1 and 6 definitely
represent structural posts, though, and these are identified as pecan and acacia/
mesquite. Some of the burned local woods may also represent dried branches and
brush gathered near the mission and piled up beside the stockade by the attacking
Indians as they torched the compound. It is also likely that some of the burned local
woods came from furniture and other items built by the occupants after arriving at
the mission. And some of the local woods could represent wooden containers (such
as boxes, crates, and barrels), furniture, or other items that were brought from San
Antonio or San Marcos. In contrast, the three nonlocal taxa—Douglas fir, eastern
chestnut, and the pines (and possibly baldcypress) must represent wooden items
brought from Mexico.
Four groups of woods dominate the assemblage and account for 82 percent
of the nonflotation samples: acacias and mesquite (32.0 percent), pecan and hickory
(18.4 percent), oaks (17.8 percent), and pines (13.9 percent). The first three most
likely represent structural woods, while the pines probably came from Mexico with
the supply train.
Evidence of probable plant foods includes charred seeds of little barley
(Hordeum pusillum) and Chenopodium (Chenopodium sp.) from PAI flotation

samples, as well as corn (Zea mays),
beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and
hazelnut (Corylus sp.) from the
TTU samples. Corn and beans
are mentioned in the Inventory of
Supplies (see Appendix B, Table B.1,
lines 422, 426, 452, 464), and these
charred samples must represent
those imported crops because the
mission had not produced its own
crop before it was destroyed. It is
likely that the hazelnut represents
a European import brought from
Mexico City.
One unusual specimen
recovered by TTU is a large chunk of
unidentified plant material that may
be a seed cotyledon. One possibility is
that this charred mass is part of an
item that appears in the Inventory of
Supplies as 24 dozen ojos de benado
or deer eyes. This may refer to deer
eyes covered with tin that were an
ornamental charm (see Chapter
14). McWilliams (2001:127) believes
that ojos de benado does not refer to
actual deer eyes but rather identifies
large brown and black seeds that
resemble deer eyes. These seeds
come from Thevetia sp., a plant in
the Apocynaceae or Dogbane family.

Chapter 10 compares the plants recovered from the mission and those in
the Inventory of Supplies with those in other mission inventories and documents.
Cypress beams were mentioned in the Mission San Bernardo transfer inventory
as construction material for a new church. Thus, it is possible that the charred
bald cypress wood found at Mission San Sabá represents an imported construction
material.
The Petrographic and INAA Ceramic Studies
Appendixes F and G present the results of INAA and petrographic analyses
of selected ceramic sherds from Mission San Sabá, Presidio San Sabá, and the
nearby Fivemile Crossing site. The petrographic study by David Robinson looked at
17 Native-made sherds and concluded that the plainwares from all three sites are
different and probably represent different manufacturing sources. This distinction
seems to be corroborated by the INAA results. Four of the five Mission San Sabá

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
plainwares are bone-tempered and generally fit the description of Goliad Plain
typically found at Spanish mission in Texas; the fifth sherd is similar in appearance
but contains no bone.
The INAA mic study conducted at the Missouri University Research
Reactor by Ferguson and Glascock analyzed 321 sherds from 10 Spanish colonial
sites and 1 Toyah phase occupation (Fivemile Crossing site). This sample includes
24 sherds from Mission San Sabá and 5 sherds from Presidio San Sabá. Most
sherds (n = 234) are assigned to 21 chemical groups (the others are unassigned
or outliers). The detailed interpretations of what the INAA data may mean are
presented in Chapter 12. The most important implications for Mission San Sabá
are as follows: (1) five of the Native-made plainwares from the mission do not
match the Native-made plainwares from any other sites, including Presidio San
Sabá; (2) one Native-made plainware sherd from the mission (the one without bone
temper) is unassigned and does not match any other sherds; (3) the two redware
or red-slipped sherds from the mission match redwares sherds from three other
missions, as well as sherds classified as lead-glazed earthenwares from three
other missions; (4) the nine majolica sherds from the mission are assigned to a
single chemical group and represent a single source, perhaps in Spain (there are
no comparative data); (5) the five olive jar sherds from the mission are assigned to
two different groups that correspond to visual classifications as two different styles,
and both groups contain olive jar sherds from one other mission in east Texas;
and (6) the salt-glazed stoneware sherd from the mission, thought to represent
a European-made (perhaps German) white stoneware, does not match any other
ceramics (the database lacks comparative samples).
The overall conclusions are that it is unlikely that any of the pottery found
at Mission San Sabá was made there, and the ceramics come from a wide variety
of sources. They probably include wares manufactured in Europe and in the New
World, most likely at some of the Spanish missions in Mexico or Texas. The fact
that the Mission San Sabá redwares chemically match many other redwares and
lead-glazed earthenwares from four other mission sites (San Juan, Rosario, Refugio,
and Dolores) is evidence that wares from a single ceramic manufacturing center
were being widely dispersed among the mission sites in Texas. Finally, because some
other INAA chemical groups contain both Native-made plainwares and lead-glazed
earthenwares, it is possible that Native Americans were making plainwares and
lead-glazed wares at some of the Texas missions.
Isotope Analysis of Lead Artifacts
For his graduate research at TTU, Steven Schooler (2010) conducted an
isotope analysis on the lead artifacts recovered from the mission in 1993–1994 and
1997. Schooler conducted the same type of analysis on the lead artifacts from the
FM 2092 right of way. He compared the data with the geochemical signatures for
known Spanish and French lead sources, and then he mapped out the distribution
of these artifacts by inferred sources. His research conclusively identifies a
concentration of fired musket balls around the chapel as being French lead brought
by the Norteños, while the lead artifacts from the PAI excavations were identified

391

392

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
as Mexican. The latter probably represents objects such as musket balls and baling
seals that were inside storage structures and melted when the mission burned.
THE INVENTORY OF SUPPLIES AND MATERIAL
REMAINS OF THE MISSION
Mission San Sabá has been noted as the most well-furnished mission on the
Texas frontier. A wealthy silver miner, Don Pedro Romero de Terreros, provided all
of the funding for the effort. Not only did he hope to eventually obtain a nobility
title from the king of Spain for this and other philanthropic endeavors, but he
also had his eye on possible mining opportunities in the region. He spared no
expense, and the mule train carried all the supplies needed to build and support
several missions. One of the priests compiled a detailed listing of all the items
purchased, where they were purchased, and what they cost, as well as listing
all the payments made for services to transport everything. We know all of this
because the original 16-page document survived and was translated into English
and published (Dennis 1995a). The document has no formal title, and it is now
known as the Inventory of Supplies.
The entire Inventory document appears in Appendix B, and it is analyzed
in Chapter 14. It is unique in many ways. It provides a listing of all the goods and
supplies purchased in Mexico City and on the journey and hence is a packing and
price list of what was needed to establish up to three missions in the remote northern
frontier of New Spain. It is the only founding inventory for a Texas mission that
has been discovered and translated. And Mission San Sabá was the only mission
enterprise in Texas to be privately funded by a single person. This was a well-funded
effort, with more and better provisions than the typical government- or churchsponsored one.
Other known inventories for Texas missions are all transfer inventories,
which were created for very different purposes than the Mission San Sabá Inventory.
Transfer inventories were made to document the exchange of church property when
a mission was being moved from one location to another or being taken over by a
different religious college. This usually occurred when a mission was failing, and the
transfer inventory was simply a listing of what property was on hand at the moment.
In contrast, the Mission San Sabá Inventory identifies the full range of
goods necessary to build and support a mission effort, including items that can
be classified as ecclesiastical, household, medicinal, animal husbandry, carpentry
tools, and farming tools. For most items, it mentions the type of material (such as
metal, ceramic, or cloth), and descriptive words and phrases were sometime used
for particular high-quality items (e.g., gilded, highest quality, embroidered in gold).
The comparatively high prices paid generally correspond with items described as
being of the finest quality, and most of these luxury items were for the priest.
Given the many lavish goods of a nonperishable nature listed, it was assumed
that at least some of the artifacts recovered would be superior to those found in
other missions in Texas, all of which were state-funded. However, McWilliams
(2001) found that the majority of the artifacts from the TTU 1997 excavations are

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
consistent with those from other missions, and the artifacts recovered during the
PAI excavations follow this same pattern. The one notable exception is a gold-plated,
brass pocket sundial found by TTU archeologists. It was a navigational instrument
called a universal equinoctial ring dial, and it bears an inscribed date of 1580. Its
context suggests that it was lost on the day of the mission attack and got buried
under a pile of dead oxen that were killed and butchered by the Indians (Hall 2001).
It is not mentioned in the Inventory, and it may have been a family heirloom owned
by one of the priests. At least two unusual religious items reportedly were found
at or near the mission. A brass bell is in a local private collection (Hall 2001), and
an intact chalice at the Fort Croghan Museum in Burnet, Texas. Overall, however,
the material culture recovered in the mission excavations by both TTU and PAI is
dominated by mundane items and lacks the luxury items listed in the Inventory.
The absence of luxury goods, the low density of materials overall compared
to the plethora of objects in the Inventory, and the highly fragmented nature of the
artifacts found are due to historical events at the mission and the postdepositional
history at the mission site. Once all the materials in the Inventory arrived at the
San Saba River, the Spaniards and mission Indians began consuming the food and
using the nonperishable items, and this continued over the next 11 months. Some
of the nonperishable items might have been taken away for use elsewhere (e.g.,
farming tools to work on the acequia and fields) and the priests likely gave many
of the trinkets described in the Inventory to visiting Apache Indians. Collectively,
however, all of the activities during the mission’s brief occupation apparently did not
have much of an impact on the total amount of nonperishable objects left there. But
things changed dramatically on the day of the attack. Thousands of armed warriors
pillaged the storerooms and burned the buildings and stockade. They carried off
anything they considered valuable, and they destroyed much of the rest. It is likely
that a large proportion of the materials brought to the mission disappeared or were
destroyed beyond recognition on March 16, 1758.
Presidial soldiers returned to the mission on March 18 to assess the damage
and found it smoldering in ruins. The religious icons and church property had been
desecrated, and the stores of supplies were stolen or smashed (Nathan and Simpson
2000:55–56). On March 24, the soldiers made another reconnaissance and found the
decapitated body of Father Santiesteban. They found his head in the burned ruins
of the clothing storehouse. The buried him in the mission cemetery and salvaged
some more items before returning to the presidio (Nathan and Simpson 2000:98).
It appears that within a week of the attack, most of the expensive and ornate
nonperishable items listed in the Inventory had been stolen or broken into small
pieces by the Indians or salvaged by the soldiers.
Thee history of the mission did not end with its destruction, however. The
Spanish soldiers from the presidio likely returned there on multiple occasions,
perhaps taking advantage of rains that exposed more items, and during the staging
of the 1759 campaign against the Norteños, Colonel Ortiz Parrilla and his soldiers
camped nearby so as not to disturb the activities at the presidio. Over the next
century, many people may have visited the old mission site and carried off items,
but these events are not recorded.

393

394

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Then came the early settlers who moved into the area in the 1870s. The first
farmer to till the land at the old mission reportedly hit numerous “stumps” with
his plow, having to pull the remnants of the stockade posts from the ground. These
early farmers also dug up a skull and other human bones. They regularly picnicked
at Kissing Springs, at the river immediately east of the mission site, and probably
walked the fields to find more relics of Texas history. Around 1891–1893, local people
gathered a wagonload of relics and carted them off to be displayed at the state fair.
Nobody knows what became of these Mission San Sabá artifacts (Callan 1901:2–3).
Curiosity seekers and local artifact collectors probably visited the mission site until
its location faded from people’s memories in the early twentieth century.
The land was farmed more or less continually starting in the late 1870s, first
with mule-drawn plows and later with mechanized farming equipment. Plowing
and associated acitivites continued to disturb what was left of the mission. During
this time, the old Spanish road was expanded into a gravel-covered county road
and eventually into a paved farm-to-market road. The expanding roads with their
maintained deep borrow ditches crossed directly over a portion of the mission and
also continued to disturb the remains of it. The combined effects of all of these
activities over 255 years since the mission was destroyed explain why TTU and
PAI archeologists found only tiny pieces of artifacts and discontinuous remains of
the mission buildings and features.
SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF A SLICE OF THE MISSION
Spatial analyses of the Spanish colonial and probable Spanish colonial
artifacts, features, burned daub concentrations, and faunal remains found in the
PAI excavations provide a window into activities that occurred in the long east-west
slice of the mission site along FM 2092. Taken in context with the available TTU
archeological data for the rest of the mission, the spatial interpretations are placed
in the bigger context of the whole mission complex, as discussed in Chapter 12.
Two topics are most important. The first is the archeological evidence for
widespread burning. The burned daub, melted lead artifacts, and a faint ash lens
observed in many of the units denote the event that destroyed the mission. The
second is the archeological evidence for the layout of the mission complex.
Historical and Archeological Evidence of the
Destruction Event
Historical records, including the 1760s Destruction painting, give a fairly
clear picture of the attack on the mission. They describe bands of hostile Indians,
collectively called the Norteños and numbering about 1,500 to 2,000 warriors,
encircling the compound early in the morning of March 16. They were dressed in
full war regalia and bearing French firearms. Most records state that a soldier
recognized a friendly Indian and let them into the compound, but another indicates
that the Indians reached in and opened the gate themselves. Regardless, they soon
began to loot the storerooms and destroy religious items. After some conversations,
the father president mounted his horse to ride with the Indians to the presidio. But

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
this move was misinterpreted, and the Norteños shot him and an accompanying
soldier. The violence began to escalate, and another priest and several soldiers were
killed. The third priest and other mission occupants were forced to retreat to the
safety of the structures. Then, the Indians set fire to the stockade and buildings,
adding dried brush brought specifically for this purpose. For many hours, the several
survivors huddled in a protective room, defending themselves with a small cannon
and firearms. The group was able to escape that night, but the destruction was
already complete.
When the soldiers from the presidio came to investigate two days later, they
found several bodies that were “burned to cinders,” and “the ground was strewn
with smoldering debris from its ruins.” All the buildings and the stockade had been
destroyed. They found “crates of church ornaments broken to pieces and charred
by the flames” and many bales, boxes, and barrels of supplies “broken apart and
burning” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:56). The attack resulted in the deaths of 12
Spaniards who were at the mission: the 2 priests, the mission’s mayordomo and his
son, 7 soldiers, and an unidentified child (Terreros 2004:163–164).74 The priests and
at least four others were buried in the cemetery near the chapel. Also killed were
12 oxen and all the mission cats and dogs. In the depositions given after the attack,
a soldier reported that 17 were killed.
One would expect such extensive destruction to leave a substantial
archeological signature, and it appears this is indeed the case. During the 1990s
investigations, TTU exposed and mapped ca. 120 post stains, several wall trenches,
26 features including a burial pit (previously moved grave), and 3 bone pits. One of
the bone pits contained the remains of the killed oxen, another contained a human
parietal bone as well as a horse head, and the third, northwest of the stockade, may
have been a trash pit. Many of the post stain features appear to represent in situ
burned posts along the western side of the stockade, while others probably represent
burned stockade and structural posts along or near the mission’s south wall. The
highest concentration of burned daub was found in this area, which suggests that
there were several wattle-and-daub buildings there. The isolated post stains in the
center of the site are undoubtedly the remains of the burned chapel.
The PAI excavations obtained similar evidence for the mission-burning
event. This includes the following:

74

•

An ash lens (Feature 13). This ca. 3-cm-thick intermittent layer of grayish
ashy sediment spans ca. 54 m east-west along the FM 2092 right of way.
Because it is so widespread, it constitutes the most-definitive evidence
of the burning event. The Spanish artifacts primarily were found below
it, and those artifacts found above it were probably dredged up from
the borrow ditch. The discontinuous lens was difficult to discern in
the profile views of only one or two units, but when larger spans were
opened, it became distinct.

•

Three post and postmolds (Features 1, 4, and 6). These were exposed
at the western end of the excavations, and when compared with the

See Chapter 2 for a discussion of estimates of the numbers killed.

395

396

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
TTU feature maps, they appear to represent posts along the exterior
walls of small structures. All three features contained charred remains
of wooden posts that had burned in situ.
•

Dense concentrations of burned daub found near the burned posts.
These provide additional evidence that several wattle-and-daub
structures along the mission’s south wall were burned.

•

A concentration of melted lead artifacts (12 specimens in Unit AW16)
found along with a dense daub concentration representing burned
wattle-and-daub structures. These structures may have been storerooms
that were looted and burned.

•

A cluster (Feature 10) of mixed animal bones—including native fauna
and domesticated Spanish livestock—that also contained a Perdiz
arrow point and a strike-a-light flint. This feature dates to the 11month occupation of the mission. Bands of Lipan Apache visited the
mission for several days at time, and historic records regularly refer
to them partaking in the gifts of the Spanish. Feature 10 appears to
represent the interaction of these two cultures.

The evidence is strongest when one looks at all of the data described in
Chapter 12. The ash lens, the burned posts, the daub, the melted lead and other
burned Spanish artifacts, and even the intensively heated chipped stone artifacts
combine to represent the burned surface at the end of the mission occupation.
Archeological Evidence for the Layout of the Mission
When PAI began its investigations, there were only two published studies
that included spatial information on the TTU archeological features and material
culture. Hindes (et al. 1995) present maps and spatial distributions for some
aspects of the 1993–1994 investigations. And Cavallin-Cosma (2000) analyzed
the distributions of the postmolds and other features and prepared the first
comprehensive interpretation of the layout of the mission compound. The spatial
information in these studies provided a starting point for understanding the mission
layout.
The machine and hand excavations by TTU covered an area roughly 110 m
east-west by 70 m north-south on the private property north of FM 2092. Based on the
features and artifacts found in this area, the original mission compound was inferred
to be inside a square or rectangular stockade wall estimated to be approximately 70 m
east-west by 50 m north-south (230x164 ft). The TTU excavations also revealed that
the compound extended southward into the FM 2092 right of way, but it appeared
that its south wall might be very close to the property fence line.
The initial PAI work involved mechanical trenches and hand excavations on
the north and south sides of FM 2092, but the testing revealed that intact missionrelated deposits were restricted to a thin strip, 3 m wide at the most, along the
north edge of the right of way. In the data recovery phase, the hand excavations
were expanded to cover a 70-m-long strip 2–3 m wide. Some of the excavations

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
were immediately adjacent to TTU units just inside the private property fence. This
narrow strip of slightly elevated land along the fence line contained the most-intact
archeological deposits because it was less disturbed by cultivation than land to the
north and by road construction and maintenance than land to south.
Based on the combined TTU and PAI data and some preliminary maps and
interpretations shared by Dr. Grant Hall (personal communication 2009–2011),
it appears that the temporary mission consisted of a chapel and eight or nine
buildings that served as mission offices, housing, and storerooms. All were apparently
Spanish-style jacales of wattle-and-daub construction, and these were surrounded
by a wooden post stockade of unknown height. The PAI excavations uncovered a
portion of the southern edge of the compound, most of which was to the north in
the privately owned field investigated by TTU. Most of the researchers involved
in this project believe the compound was rectangular with its long axis oriented
east–west and that the TTU data provide evidence of multiple structures (perhaps
eight) around the perimeter of the stockade. It is not certain whether the walls of the
wattle-and-daub buildings were integrated into the stockade walls, or whether the
buildings were spaced a few feet north of the southern palisade wall. The features
found near the center of the compound suggest that the rectangular chapel was
also oriented east–west.
The locations of the mission gates are less clear, but based on the horizontal
distribution of postmold features, a gate on the west side of the stockade probably
accessed a corral. The main gate may have been on the south side of the stockade
between 5 and 20 m east of the historical monument. This interpretation is based
on a combination of circumstantial evidence, including a concentration of Spanish
artifacts in this area (Feature 17) and the location of the gate as depicted in the
Destruction painting.
When PAI began its work, perceptions of what the mission remains might
look like were based, in part, on comparisons with the layout of Mission San
Lorenzo de Santa Cruz, which was built only five years later and was only 87 miles
to the south. And the military commander and soldiers from Presidio San Sabá
were directly involved with the creation of Mission San Lorenzo (Chipman 2010b).
Furthermore, Fathers Diego Ximénez and Joaquín de Baños, two of the priests
originally assigned to Mission San Sabá went on to Mission San Lorenzo in 1761
(Chipman 2010b; Newcomb 1969:165). So it seemed logical that the two designs
might have been similar. The permanent mission structures at San Lorenzo were
laid out in a trapezoid that measured approximately 187x166 ft (Tunnell 1969:8),
and it was thought that the temporary mission compound at San Sabá might be
similar in size and shape. Based on the analysis of the 1760s Destruction painting
in Chapter 13, however, it appears this presumption may have been incorrect.
Considering all the TTU and PAI evidence, the southern, western, and
northern stockade walls appear to be fairly well delineated, but the east wall is not.
The investigations extended eastward only until the recovery of Spanish artifacts
dropped off, which seemed to coincide with where the ground surface was dropping
toward the old spring. It was assumed that postdepositional factors—primarily

397

398

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
plowing and subsequent deflation and erosion—might have removed most or all of
the Spanish colonial deposits, including artifacts and postholes that delineated the
eastern stockade wall. However, Chapter 13 argues that the Destruction painting may
be accurate in its depiction of a rectangular stockade with a large open courtyard
or plaza on the east side. Such a courtyard might contain sparse artifacts because
few trash-generating activities occurred there and because it was maintained and
kept clean. This could explain why TTU’s systematic metal detector survey found
few artifacts in the easternmost areas they investigated (Hindes et al. 1995:Figure
4). Consequently, the archeological visibility of the eastern part of the mission might
be limited to postholes along the stockade fence, if they survived. The Destruction
painting suggests that this fence could be as much as 40 to 60 m east of the historical
monument, beyond the subsurface investigations by TTU or PAI.
Whether archeological evidence of the eastern stockade wall still survives
depends on several factors, especially the amount of postdepositional disturbance
due to modern agricultural use. There undoubtedly has been some erosion and soil
deflation in the field north of FM 2092, and the modern ground surface does slope
to the north and northeast toward Harris Hollow and east toward the bend in the
San Saba River. However, it is possible that the modern surface follows the same
general slope as during the mission period.
Also, based on TTU mapping data provided by Dr. Grant Hall, the ground
surface slopes more sharply to the north than to the east. TTU placed its prime
datum point at one of the highest spots centrally located in the field (see Hindes et
al. 1995:22, Figures 4, 5, and 26) and assigned it a grid coordinate of N1000/W1000.
From here, the surface slopes to the north, dropping 85 cm over a distance of 34
m. About 13 m south of the prime datum, the south edge of the plowed field at the
FM 2092 right-of-way fence is 9 cm higher in elevation. The ground surface slopes
down to the west of the prime datum, dropping 24 cm over a distance of 34 m, and
it slopes down to the east, dropping 51 cm over a distance of 56 m. But the surface
begins to rise a little farther east, and at 77 m from the prime datum it is about
25 cm higher than the datum. This subtle rise in the far eastern end of the site
area may be due in part to erosion and deflation in the field west of there, or this
rise could represent a natural levee near the river. According to maps by CavallinCosma (2000:Figure 5.3), intact features were found more than 44 m north of the
monument (20 m north of prime datum). Since the eastern end of the site is slightly
higher than this, it is reasonable to think that postholes could be preserved in the
easternmost portion of the site where no excavations have been done.
There is one final line of evidence that suggests archeological remains may
extend well east of the main investigation areas. In 1994, Mark Wolf observed
surface concentrations of burned daub as much as 50 m east of the monument (i.e.,
to E1050 on the PAI grid and W950 on the TTU grid) and about 20 m east of PAI’s
easternmost excavations (see Figure 26 in Hindes et al. 1995). But only limited
subsurface scraping was done by TTU in this eastern portion of the mission site, and
ground-penetrating radar survey indicated that a buried cultural feature(s) could
be present in the uninvestigated area 7–17 m southeast of TTU grid point N1000/
W950 (Hindes et al. 1995:Figures 4 and 5). So there are hints that there may be

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
intact features as much as 50 to 70 m east of the prime datum and the historical
monument.
In contrast to the interpretations above, Dr. Grant Hall (personal
communication 2010) believes that the stockade was rectangular with its long axis
running north–south. He concludes that the eastern wall of the compound was not
found in 1997 because the evidence was destroyed by mechanical cultivation and
increased slopewash. Hall (personal communication 2012) thinks that the livestock
corral could have been on the east side of the compound but ackowledges that the
physical evidence may be gone. Kay Hindes (personal communication 2010) believes
that the compound was rectangular and oriented with its long axis running east­–
west, that the mission stockade was underneath the FM 2092 roadway, and that the
southern stockade wall was some distance beyond the exterior walls of the buildings.
Mark Wolf (personal communication 2010) generally agrees that the eastern stockade
wall is not well defined by the TTU data, and that it could be farther east. Wolf also
believes that that the northernmost postmolds found by TTU are along the southern
edges of structures and not the northern stockade wall.
THE DESTRUCTION OF MISSION SAN SABÁ PAINTING
AND THE SOCIAL IDENTITY OF THE ATTACKING
INDIANS
Chapter 13 makes the case that the Destruction of San Sabá painting conveys
information about the social identity of the Indians who attacked the mission. All of
the Native Americans shown are attacking Indians, and it is argued that the artist
was intentionally displaying differences to highlight two main social groups: the
Red Indians being the Comanche and the White Indians being the Tejas (or Texas
in the translated documents).
On the evening of March 16, while the attack was still in progress, Colonel
Ortiz Parrilla sent a letter to the military commander in San Antonio notifying him
that the mission had been destroyed and that an attack on the presidio seemed
inevitable. Ortiz Parrilla labeled all the attackers as Comanches. The letter reached
San Antonio within four days (Dunn 1914:441; Nathan and Simpson 2000:8–9). A
subsequent flurry of letters from various Spanish officials ensued from March 20 to
25, and most identified the attackers as “Comanche Indians” or “Comanche Nations
and other allied nations” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:8–29). One letter stated that
the attackers were “Apache or Comanche Indians,” but it was transmitting thirdhand information (Nathan and Simpson 2000:15). This is the only document that
implicates the Apache, and there is no doubt that this is incorrect, although the
Spanish did place partial blame on the Apache. The Spaniards felt they were culpable
because they knew of the impending attack but did not warn the missionaries, nor
were they present to help defend the mission (Nathan and Simpson 2000:19, 21, 25).
The information relayed by Ortiz Parrilla came from a detachment of 15
soldiers dispatched from the presidio on the day of the attack to investigate. They
never reached the mission, but were “detected by the barbarous Indians as soon as
they arrived” (Wade 2007:208). They had gotten close enough to see the “mission

399

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
buildings that were burning so brightly they lit up the ground” (Wade 2007:208).75
It is likely that the Indians the soldiers encountered were a group of Comanche,
but it is unlikely that Ortiz Parrilla received full and accurate information about
all the hostile Indians from this event.
In his official deposition, Father Molina described the Indians as: “arrayed in
the most horrible attire. Besides the paint on their faces, red and black, they were
adorned with the pelts and tails of wild beasts, wrapped around them or hanging
down from their heads, as well as deer horns. Some were disguised as various kinds
of animals, and some wore feather headdresses” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:85). But
Father Molina and the other survivors also recognized that the Indians included
Native peoples from many different groups.
Following the attack, all of the eyewitnesses were interviewed, and their
words were written into the official testimonies compiled by Ortiz Parrilla and sent
to the military officials later that month. These records contain all of the firsthand
evidence identifying the Indians (Table 15.2). Although they mention unnamed
groups from the north, no eyewitness used the name “Norteños,” the generic tag
used by the Spanish for “an unknown number of groups from the north” or “the
northern groups” (Wade 2003:188, 204). The word “Norteños” only appeared in later
documents where the Spanish were implicating the undefined northern groups as the
aggressors (Harper 1953a; Weddle 2007). The eyewitnesses did not lump the groups
together because they recognized a number of distinctive social entities, whether they
were social fields, tribes, bands, or coalitions. The groups they specifically mention
are: Comanche, 6 observers; Tancague (Tanague, Taneaque), 5 observers; Tejas, 7
observers; Vidae, 6 observers; and Yojuane (Jujuan, Yajuane, Yujuane), 5 observers.
Each also mentions other unspecified nations, suggesting that they recognized there
were other groups they could not identify, or perhaps some groups were ignored
because they were few in number.
The Tancague and Yojuane are sometimes considered to be related Tonkawan
groups, or at the very least were closely allied with the Tonkawa (Bolton 1914:332,
338, 366; 374; Newcomb 1961:134; Prikryl 2001:66–68).76 Bolton (1914:366) also
notes that the Yojuane, Tancagues, and Viday (or Vidais) are among the groups
the Spanish knew well from their association with the missions at San Xavier. It
is clear that at least two of the soldiers at Mission San Sabá (Corporal Carlos de
Uraga and Corporal Ascencio Cadena) recognized these groupd because they had
been previously stationed at Presidio San Xavier.
In contrast to Bolton and other researchers, Campbell (1983:2–3) presents a
convincing argument, based on evidence in Spanish documents, that the Yojuane did

The names of bands that have been linked to the Tonkawa are confusing. Bolton (1914:338)
lists the Tancagues, Taguacanas, and Taguayas among the Tonkawan groups that came to the San
Xavier Missions. Newcomb (1961:134) includes the Tonkawega, Tancaoye, Tancaguas, Toncahua,
and Tonquaay as being synonymous with the Tonkawa, and he lists the main independent bands
of the Tonkawa as the Mayeye (or Meghey), Youjuane, and Ervipiame. Bolton (1914:374) states: “At
the mission of San Francisco Xavier he left the Mayeyes, Hierbipiames, and Yojuanes, all related
to and allied with the Tancahues (Tonkawa), a few of whom were there also.”

While at the San Xavier Missions from 1752 to 1755, Father
Aparicio spent time “mingling with the Yojuanes and the
Tancagues….Subsequently I learned from them and from other
Indians of the Texas, Vidae, and Orcoquiza nations that the
Yojuanes, Tancagues, Quichais, and Comanches hated the
Spaniards because of their friendship for, and kindness to, the
Apaches. And so, after almost three years, it was rumored and
boasted that these nations intended to join in the extermination
of the Apaches, and if they [the Apaches] should be defended by
the Spaniards, then they latter would be fought also.”

not speak a Tonkawan language and were actually a group of Wichita peoples from
north-central Oklahoma. But Campbell does agree that the Yojuane were closely
allied with the Tonkawa and that they were enemies of the Apache. So regardless
of their linguistic and ethnic identity, the Yojuane and Tonkawa (and many other
groups mentioned above) were so closely allied that many Spaniards simply lumped
them together.
A recently discovered letter from Colonel Ortiz Parrilla to Father Francisco
Trinidad Lara, dated April 8, 1758, reveals Ortiz Parrilla’s thoughts about the
attacking Indians after he had time for reflection. This letter was found in the Archivo
Franciscano de Michoacán, Templo de San Francisco, in Celaya, Mexico, and Juan M.
Romero de Terreros (2004:622) published the first English translation. Ortiz Parrilla
wrote the letter 23 days after the attack, which was about two weeks after he recorded
the eyewitness depositions. He identified only three groups as responsible parties:
“Texas, Toncaguas, Comanches” (Terreros 2004:622). Thus, it appears he had singled
out these groups because they were either the most numerous, or perhaps because
he considered some of the other named groups to be allies of, and subsumed under,
these larger groups. It is possible he simply lumped the Yojuane and Vidae names
under the Toncaguas (or Tancagues) group. It is possible he omitted the Vidae, a
group most researchers link with the peoples called Bedai (Newcomb 1969:160) and
who were well known to the Spanish in east Texas, because he considered them not
as guilty as the others or because they were few in number.
In a subsequent letter written to the Viceroy Marqués de las Amarillas on
July 4, 1758, Ortiz Parrilla mentions that friendly Apaches had come to Presidio
San Sabá and warned him that there were some “two thousand” hostile Indians in
the area, most being Comanche but also including the “Yujuany nation” and “other
nations allied with [the Comanche]” (Wade 2007:211–212). Written nearly four
months after the attack, this letter includes a scathing indictment of the Tejas and
the French in the attack. In it, he writes:
Many Indians were allied for the tyrannical attack, and the Tejas
Indians, with their presumed loyalty, did not excuse themselves from
the plot. As much as they try to hide their treason and infidelity,
time will make it obvious. For your complete information I too will
rely on time and on the procedures I will use in the field exercising
the greatest effort until I manage to punish the barbarians, and

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
acquire the exact knowledge of the routes the Infidels use for the
commerce and traffic with the French nation, as the Governor of
the Province of Texas informed your Excellency recently. (Wade
2007:214)
Many different groups were involved in the attack, but two groups were
consistently identified as the most numerous and hostile: the Comanche and their
Tejas (Texas) allies. When Ortiz Parrilla launched his punitive expedition in the fall
of 1759, he only went after the Tejas because he had no idea where the Comanche
lived. He ended up in a battle at a large Taovaya village and French trading site on
the Red River. In the mid-eighteenth century, the Taovaya were closely linked with
the Wichita, and both were involved in an alliance with the Comanche. The Taovaya,
the Wichita, and the Comanche participated regularly in the French trade on the
Red River (Harper 1953a; Newcomb 1961:248–250; Wade 2003:191–192). There is
little doubt that Ortiz Parrilla was going after the Tejas peoples who were trading
with French on the Red River, knowing that the Comanche and some of their other
allies might also be there.
It is likely that by the time the Destruction was painted in the 1760s, the
consensus was that the attack was carried out primarily by the Comanche and the
Tejas. The Comanche were relative newcomers to Texas, and the Spanish had only
recently recognized them. On the other hand, the Spanish had long encountered
many groups they lumped together as Tejas (also Texas or Teyas). Arnn (2012) dispels
the myth that the Tejas were one group of people or even a handful of different
groups. Combining ethnographic, environmental, and archeological evidence, Arnn
(2012:134–138) argues that Tejas actually referred to a social field that covered most
of the state of Texas and was comprised of 50 or more distinct social groups. Some
were related by kinship and language, but many were not related at all. What bound
these different peoples together was a common lifestyle, being hunter-gatherers in a
broadly similar environment, and the ever-changing alliances they formed through
a network of economic exchanges and social interactions.
COMPARISON OF THE SEGESSER II AND DESTRUCTION
OF MISSION SAN SABÁ PAINTINGS
The Spanish were extremely nervous about the French presence in their
northern frontier in the mid eighteenth century. Only 38 years before the attack on
Mission San Sabá, an expedition of Spanish soldiers and their Indian allies went
into the central Plains looking for the French. The Pedro de Villasur group was
camped at the confluence of the Platte and Loup Rivers, in modern Nebraska. On the
morning of August 14, 1720, a large force of well-armed Indians and French soldiers
launched a surprise attack and killed all but 13 of the Spanish soldiers (Chávez
1990:99–102). This was graphically recorded in the famous Segesser II hide painting,
which shares many attributes with the Destruction of Mission San Sabá painting.
The two Segesser hide paintings77 probably were created in the 1720s, about
four decades brfore the Destruction painting. They are some of the most significant
early eighteenth-century documents from the southwestern United States (Chávez
The paintings do not have formal titles. They are called the Segesser paintings because they

1990; Fontana 2000; Hotz 1991) and have received much scholarly attention as
historical records. Segesser I and II are both oversized paintings on tanned leather78
done by unknown and perhaps multiple artists. Unlike the Destruction painting,
they display a blend of European and indigenous folk art styles. But like Destruction,
they show historical events in a continuous narrative style. All three paintings depict
Spanish soldiers and Indians engaged in combat.
The two Segesser paintings have similar images in similar styles, but
Segesser I has not been positively linked with a specific event. Segesser II, on the
other hand, recounts the details of the August 13, 1720, battle in which the Pedro
de Villasur expedition was ambushed by a large force of Native Americans, mostly
Pawnee and Oto, and French soldiers. It may have been painted, at least in part, to
memorialize someone who died in the battle.
The similarities between the Segesser paintings and the Destruction painting
are striking. In “Pictorial Images of Spanish North America,” Bernard Fontana
discusses both the Segesser and San Sabá works as contemporary eighteenth-century
Spanish paintings. Fontana (2000:932–933) states:
The second half of the eighteenth century dawns with a large oil
painting depicting the 1758 massacre at Mission San Sabá in Texas,
an uprising of Tejas, Bidais, Tonkawa, and Comanche Indians which
resulted in the deaths of two Franciscan missionaries, Fray Alonso
Giraldo de Terreros and Fray Jose de Santiesteban along with a
half-dozen defenders…. Like the Segesser hide painting depicting
the Spanish expedition led by Pedro de Villasur to the confluence
of the Loup and Platte rivers, this oil of the San Sabá massacre
shows events painted sequentially on a single canvas. In other
words, it shows various stages of the battle—prologue, the event,
and postlude—in one grand depiction. But unlike the Villasur
painting, which is thought to have been done by a person with firsthand knowledge of the people and terrain, the San Sabá canvas is
believed to have been executed in Mexico by portrait artist José de
Páez soon after the massacre occurred. According to Mexican art
historian Manuel Toussaint (1967:339), “Jose de Páez inundated
the second half of the eighteenth century with his paintings. Among
his infinity of pictures, some have interest, as with all these artists;
but it is difficult to name one that is entirely respectable.” Whether
“respectable” or not, and it is unlikely Toussaint ever saw the San
Sabá painting, it is certainly of great interest to historians of Texas
and the Spanish Borderlands. Moreover, like the Segesser hide
paintings, it should rightfully be regarded as a part of the national
patrimony of the United States.
The Segesser paintings have been studied intensively by scholars in many
disciplines, but the Destruction painting has not, perhaps because some researchers
believe it might depict a distorted view of history. Contributing to this view is the fact
that a wealthy man commissioned the Destruction painting for the specific purposes
of documenting his great financial loses and memorializing the martyred priests,
One is 17x4.5 ft, and the other is 19x4.5 ft. Both are painted on multiple “bison or elk hides,

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
one of whom was his cousin. And it is true that the painter exercised artistic license
to make things fit into his frame and to evoke emotion. There is no doubt that the
Destruction painting depicts biased eighteenth-century Spanish viewpoints, both
in political terms (e.g., fear of the French in the northern frontier) and social terms
(i.e., the lower status and barbaric acts of the Indians), but the analysis in Chapter
13 suggests that the story it tells is largely accurate.
The people who survived the mission attack gave their depositions and
testimonies to Colonel Ortiz Parrilla, who bound the official documents together
and sent them, along with his written statements, to his superiors. But to fully
understand the documents, one must understand the gravity of this situation. Many
people stood to lose a great deal of respect and status if the documents portrayed
the failed mission efforts in a poor light. This is especially true of Ortiz Parrilla,
who was saddled with the blame for not protecting the mission and stopping the
attack despite the testimonials to the contrary. But the written testimonials do
not lay blame, and Ortiz Parrilla presented a good defense of his own actions in
subsequent letters to Father Mariano de los Dolores and the Viceroy Marqués de
las Armarillas. All of the documents depict a mission besieged by an overwhelming
number of hostile Indians, and Ortiz Parrilla’s small military force could not have
reasonably countered the offensive or prevented the final outcome. But these written
documents are heavily laden with political propaganda, social elitism, obvious
repetition of particular details, and many other biases and omissions.
All historical documents have biases, but this does not mean they are not
useful tools for historians and archeologists. On the contrary, understanding biases
and the contexts in which they were formed is an important part of interpreting
history, since it leads to a better understanding of the reality of the events, the
people, and the places they depict. Researchers have been exhaustive in their efforts
to learn the truths about Mission San Sabá, the attack that destroyed it, and the
people behind the failed effort. But up until this project, that has been limited to
seeing written documents as if they are the only sources of historical information.
This project takes a first step in remedying that through analysis of the Destruction
painting.
UNSOLVED MYSTERIES
Just as the mission location was a mystery for almost 100 years, other
mysteries about the site remain even after the rediscovery and years of intensive
study. One relates to uncertainty about the locations of the northern and eastern
walls of the stockade. Hypotheses about them have been made and would be testable
with additional archeological investigations. Such work could uncover features that
precisely define the walls, or evidence could be missing, leaving us to wonder if it
was removed by plowing and erosion.
Another mystery relates to the irrigation system. When the priests came to
the San Saba River, they were not novices at building such systems. The documents
reveal that an acequia was under construction when the mission was destroyed in
March, and it is likely it was nearing completion with the priests intending to plant

405

406

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
their first crops in April or May. At least one of the priests was directing the work,
and he would have been knowledgeable about canal irrigation, perhaps having
studied elaborate acequia systems at the San Antonio missions. The irrigation canal
and planned agricultural fields would have been nearby, likely within a mile to the
west toward the presidio.
Despite much discussion and some directed fieldwork, the mission fields have
not been found. In 2007, PAI archeologists consulted with Dr. William Doolittle, who
has studied historic irrigation systems and agriculture for many years. We looked
at the landscape near the mission, speculated on what role Harris Hollow might
have played, and came to no definitive conclusions. We then dug a backhoe trench
across one of the old Menard Irrigation Company laterals on Monte Lyckman’s
land west of the mission. The thought was that there might be evidence that the
modern lateral followed the old Spanish ditch. All of the sediments exposed were
homogenous and thick black clays, however, and there was no hint that this feature
was old. This effort suggests that it may be difficult, if not impossible, to find the
unfinished irrigation ditch. Because the acequia was never used, it never had any
water flowing through it, and thus there would be no different sediments deposited
in it. The ditch would have slowly filled with sediments from overbank floods, and
these would be the same as the alluvial terrace deposits that it was dug into.
PAI and others speculated that the priests planned to build a diversion dam
on the river to divert water into a main ditch, with a possible location being at a
prominent meander bend about 1.6 miles northwest of the mission and a terminal
point at Harris Hollow near the mission. No evidence of this was found, however.
A third mystery is the location of the mission cemetery. The eyewitness
accounts and other documents detail the fate of the two martyred priests and the
other mission occupants who were killed, and they also tell where these people were
buried. Juan M. Romero de Terreros (2004:623–624) has the most accurate summary
of this information, and he notes that at least six people were buried in the mission
cemetery, which was apparently in front of the burned chapel: Father Terreros, the
father president; Father Santiesteban; Juan Antonio Gutiérrez, mission mayordomo;
Joseph Garciá, soldier and escort to the father president; Lázaro de Ayala, soldier
at the mission; and Enrique Gutiérrez, son of the mayordomo.
The 1997 TTU investigations found “an empty grave at the west end of the
stains representing the church. All that was found in this grave were a human
finger bone, a couple of teeth, and a number of green-glass seed beads. We assume
that the body the grave once contained was disinterred and removed to another
location following the 1758 attack” (Hall 2001). This certainly is plausible. Although
no documents state that graves were disinterred by the Spanish, it is likely that
some or all of them could have been moved to the presidio in the years following
the mission destruction. But this raises the question of why only one grave was
found. Perhaps the others were so shallow they were destroyed by plowing, or they
were all disinterred completely and the grave shafts were destroyed in the process,
leaving nothing recognizable for the archeologists to find. Or maybe only the two
priests were buried near the church, and the others who were buried somewhere

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
else at the mission. Relevant to this latter possibility is a report of a human skull
found at the mission between 1894 and 1899 (Elizabeth Hockensmith letter in Kay
Hindes research files; see Appendix A) and reports of graves having been dug up
when FM 2092 was constructed (Kay Hindes research notes; see Appendix A).
WHY DID MISSION SAN SABÁ FAIL?
The historical evidence makes it clear that the mission project was doomed
from the onset, and almost everyone involved knew it. Fathers Baños and Ximénez,
who were requesting permission to leave the mission in July 1757, wrote: “We find no
reason why we should remain with this enterprise, which we consider ill-conceived
and without foundation from the beginning” (Dunn 1914:401; Weddle 1964:60).
These two disgruntled priests knew they had little chance of success in converting
the Apache. Although they could not know the ultimate fate of the mission, their
timing in leaving was lucky indeed.
Even Father Terreros, who poured his heart and soul into the San Sabá
effort, had serious misgivings. He wrote to the commissary general: “All Hell is
joined to impede this enterprise” (Weddle 1964:67). Terreros also wrote to the viceroy,
requesting permission to return to Mexico City, along with Colonel Ortiz Parrilla, and
be allowed to plead his case to abandon the effort (Nathan and Simpson 2000:1–4;
Weddle 1964:67). Ortiz Parrilla, a knowledgeable military man, had concerns as
well and was wise enough to foresee the coming storm. He, too, wrote the viceroy
asking for a face-to-face meeting, but the attack occurred before his letter reached
Mexico City (Nathan and Simpson 2000:7–8: Weddle 1964:67–68).
While some of the Spaniards were aware of the problems they faced on
the San Saba River, others were not. The entire effort was planned and executed
because people were ignorant of, or chose to ignore, some of the realities of the
northern frontier and the complexities of the Native American peoples they were
dealing with. In his book Empire of the Summer Moon, Gwynne (2010:62) succinctly
summarizes the situation:
The Spanish made many mistakes in their northern provinces. They
made them with metronomic consistency and they made them over
a colonial period that spanned two centuries. Though they were not
always cruel and incompetent, they were cruel and incompetent
enough of the time to cause great problems for themselves, and
they were inevitably hamstrung by European-style military and
civilian bureaucracies attempting to operate in a savage land of
barren mesas and infinite horizons. The entire premise of their
northern expansion—essentially a headlong and blindly optimistic
dive into lands dominated by culturally primitive, mounted, and
irremediably hostile Indians—was fatally flawed.
At least seven factors contributed to the failure. The first was the poor
relationship between Father Terreros and Father Dolores of the San Antonio
missions, which continued from the initiation of the project through the founding of
Mission San Sabá. Two factions developed in San Antonio as a result of the personal
conflicts between them. Their disagreements had been brewing for some time. Father

407

408

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Dolores had wanted a mission project for the Apache for nearly 20 years. In 1752,
Terreros was in line to replace Father Dolores as president of the Texas missions,
but for reasons unknown he suddenly appeared as president of the gateway Mission
San Juan Bautista, in 1754 (Dunn 1912:197). Perhaps the two had issues dating
back to this incident.
Second, Captain Ortiz Parrilla, who did not trust the Apache and understood
some of their true nature and motives, never believed in the project, and he did not
get along with Father Terreros or his companion, Father Francisco de la Santísima
Trinidad. Dunn (1914:393–395) relates many stories about the poor relationships
between these men. Some were told by Father Trinidad in a 17-page handwritten
document entitled “Vindicta del Rio de San Saba” (Trinidad 1758), which was
translated by Dennis (1995b) as the “Revenge of the Rio San Saba.” Trinidad wrote
the document sometime after the mission attack in March 1758, and it explains the
controversy between the two camps (Dunn 1914:395, n. 28). His “object in writing
it was stated to be to put on the record the truth of the opposition to the enterprise
so that it should not be concealed at some future time when there might be a desire
to distort the facts” (Dunn 1914:395).
Third, the missionaries and Colonel Ortiz Parrilla took sides against each
other while still in San Antonio, and this caused schisms right up until the mission
attack. At one point, Father Terreros described the situation as a “hate campaign
being conducted against him” (Weddle 1964:48). This rift separated the mission
project from its much-needed support from San Antonio (Weddle 1964:66), and
it caused open opposition between the missionaries and their military protector.
Records indicate that Ortiz Parrilla and Terreros belatedly came to terms with
each other in the months prior to the attack. By February 1758, they had discussed
various options for a “different future course for the mission” (Weddle 1964:65) and
planned to go to Mexico City to state their case to the viceroy (Nathan and Simpson
2000:1–4, 7–8).
Fourth, Colonel Ortiz Parrilla went to the mission on the day before the
attack and made a plea to the priests to bring everyone to the presidio for protection,
but they refused (Nathan and Simpson 2000:60). Maybe they did not believe Ortiz
Parrilla, or perhaps they wanted to become martyrs. Their motives will never be
known, but it is easy to imagine that the bitter relations between Father Terreros
and the colonel came into play.
Fifth, the mission and the presidio were far apart. Everyone knew that
soldiers were needed to protect missions in frontier areas. The presence of soldiers
went beyond this single function, however, and it was commonly believed that “in
missions where there are no soldiers there is no success” (testimony from Fray
Romualdo Cartagena, guardian of the College of Santa Cruz de Querétaro, 1772,
as cited in Bolton [1917:54]). But over time the missionaries had learned not to
trust the soldiers, who were frequently rebellious. The missionaries were opposed
to “unsuitable soldiers” and “immoral or insubordinate soldiers were deemed a
nuisance.” They observed that “presidial soldiers were largely half-breeds…and
often jail birds” (Bolton 1917:54). The clergy also learned from their experiences at

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
the failed San Xavier missions, where Felipe de Rábago y Terán and his soldiers in
the nearby presidio had extramarital relations with many of Indian women at the
missions. The result was an often-precarious situation, a balancing act between
the church and the military. If the mission and presidio were too close together, the
soldiers would cause trouble at the mission. But if the mission was too far away,
the soldiers would not be able to respond quickly and provide protection. At San
Sabá, the mission and presidio were 4 miles apart, and the presidial soldiers were
of little use when the Norteños came to the mission in force.
Sixth, the remote location of the mission, in the farthest reaches of the
northern frontier, contributed to its failure. It suffered from political isolation
as well. It was not under the jurisdiction of the San Antonio missions, and the
authorities were not sure if it should fall under the jurisdiction of Texas, New
Mexico, or Coahuila. Don Pedro de Rábago y Terán, captain of the San Xavier
presidio, recommended to the viceroy that it would be best if the new Apache
mission was independent of these three provinces and subject only to the viceroy
(Castañeda 1936:369). This became the policy when Ortiz Parrilla was assigned
duty as captain of Presidio San Sabá, and Mission San Sabá was accountable only
to the viceroy during its brief life. Its geographic isolation impeded communication
between the mission and the viceroy. Under normal circumstances, a complete
correspondence with Mexico City took about four months (Weddle 1964:61). Even
the momentous news of the mission’s destruction took 23 days to reach the viceroy
(Dunn 1914:413).
Seventh, the fear of the French intruding into their territory played a
large role in decisions by the Spanish regarding if, when, and where to place
missions and presidios in the northern frontier. The long-time European rivals
were competing for territory in the New World, and a fluctuating boundary formed
between Spanish territory in Texas and French territory in Louisiana. The constant
political and military maneuvering had a tremendous impact on the Spanish
settlement patterns and history in Texas. The year 1719, for example, was a busy
time for both nations. The Spanish established several missions and a presidio
in east Texas, France and Spain went to war in Europe, the French attacked the
Spanish mission at San Miguel de Linares de los Adaes (western Louisiana),
and the Spanish abandoned east Texas temporarily and pulled back to the new
settlement at San Antonio de Béxar (Wade 2003:168). Tensions between France
and Spain persisted in Texas up until the 1763 Treaty of Paris ceded the French
territory of Louisiana to Spain. As Herbert Bolton (1915:v) put it, “In the middle
eighteenth century Texas occupied an important position on the northeastern
frontier of New Spain. Down to 1762 it was the buffer province between France
and Spain in their contest for empire on this continent.” After that, the nature
of French, Spanish, and Indian relations in Texas change dramatically (Bolton
1915:102–103; Chipman 1992:171–173).
Three significant events during the first half of the eighteenth century are
particularly important to the story of Mission San Sabá: (1) the establishment
of French trading posts among the Caddo in east Texas; (2) the spread of French
traders into the Red River valley; and (3) the Comanche-Wichita alliance of

409

410

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
1747 (Bolton 1915:90, 121; Newcomb 1961:23, 248–249, 288). The importance
of the French trade with the northern tribes was paramount. Because of these
connections, the Norteños were well mounted and well armed. Eyewitness accounts
reported the following:
They had French firearms, bullet pouches, and very large powder
horns…Most of them had muskets and cutlasses.
The arms the Indians carried were muskets, as well as other weapons
not ordinarily used by them….[The Indians had a] plentiful supply
of firearms…[The Spaniards] were helpless against the accurate
musket fire of the Indian barbarians…He had never seen or heard
of hostile Indians attacking our forces in such numbers and so fully
armed.
The lieutenant never suspected that such a host of enemies could
equip themselves with firearms….It is now evident that the Indians
have been trained in the skillful use of firearms and are thoroughly
experienced in making war with the greatest sagacity and cunning.
The fire of the enemy was superior because of the great number of
their guns.
Most of the enemy carried firearms, ammunition in large powder
horns and pouches, swords, lances, and cutlasses…Many had
helmets, and many had leather jerkins, or breastplates like those
of the French…It was also evident that the said nations and many
other Indians had been trading and associated with the French,
from whom they obtained arms, ammunition, helmets, and other
prized possessions which they used to good advantage…Never
before had he seen so many barbarians together, armed with guns
and handling them so skillfully.
He recognized their weapons as French muskets and lances.
Great Chief…was a Comanche…His war dress and his red jacket
were well-decorated, after the manner of French uniforms, and he
was fully armed…equipped with at least 1,000 firearms. (Nathan
and Simpson 2000:44, 47–53, 66, 71, 74–76, 82, 86–90)
Even before these accounts were put on paper, the Spanish had already
blamed the French. News of the massacre reached San Antonio de Béxar on March 20,
1758, and the Spanish commandant at the Presidio of the Sacramento in Monclova,
Coahuila, received the news three days later. In a letter dated March 23, 1758, he
stated that a courier had brought “the unhappy news that 2,000 Comanche Indians,
instigated by foreign political agents and equipped with firearms, have attacked
the Presidio of San Luis de las Amarillas. Its Commandant, Colonel Don Diego
Ortiz Parrilla, is being besieged there, and the Missions under his charge have been
destroyed” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:17). The only official news that could have
been available in Mexico seven days after the attack was Colonel Parrilla’s original
dispatch sent on March 16. Although this document is not among the translated
papers, it seems that Ortiz Parrilla’s letter must have been direct in implicating the
French. Exactly how much he knew about this before he interviewed the survivors
is uncertain, but he had dispatched soldiers from the presidio to investigate and

Chapter 15: Historical Archeology at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
report back to him (Nathan and Simpson 2000:46, 80). He must have interpreted
the heavy gunfire during the attack as evidence the Indians had obtained guns
from the French.
All the letters written up through March 25 were from and to various military
and local officials in San Antonio and northern Mexico. The first statements sent
directly to the viceroy in Mexico City were opinion letters dated April 6, the same day
they received the news and supporting documents. In one of these letters, Auditor
Don Domingo, Valcárcel to the viceroy, said:
In these documents it is made clear that the new Presidio of San
Luis, as well as the Mission under its protection, was attacked by
2,000 Comanche Indians and other allied nations, equipped with
firearms and apparently instigated by foreign political agents….
This occurrence, your Excellency, besides the sorrow that such a
disaster must bring us, ought to make us cautious on many points,
for the Comanche Nation is warlike and well instructed in the
use of firearms through frequent communication with the French.
(Nathan and Simpson 2000:32–33)
Only 21 days after the mission fell, the viceroy and other political leaders in
Mexico City knew the French were involved. This must have been discussed at the
highest levels for some time, and it led to a major military campaign to retaliate in
1759 (Weddle 2007). One can argue about the true level of French involvement vs.
Spanish paranoia about the French, and about Ortiz Parrilla and the other soldiers at
the presidio having had ample motivation to overemphasize the French involvement
in an embarrassing defeat. But the French did not cause the attack, and it is unlikely
that they actively encouraged their Native trading partners to undertake it. The
presence of the French traders along the Red River did set the wheels in motion,
though. The Comanche-Wichita alliance in 1747 happened because both groups
wanted access to the French trade. These northern tribes became powerful quickly,
and the French guns undoubtedly gave them confidence in attacking their enemies.
An incident that occurred in Louisiana less than six months after the attack
demonstrates the importance of the French trade to the northern tribes:
A French citizen appeared in Nachitos (Natchitoches) August 10,
1758, and said that he had encountered a group of Tuaganas Indians
who took everything he had and “threw to him several vestings of
silk, torn, stained, and half burned, several galloons of gold and
silver, a communion cup, two containers of the sacred oils, two
tapens, three plates of a certain metal which he did not recognize,
and three forks.” (Archivo General de Indias, Audencia de Mexico,
1763, part 2:265–269, as cited in Gilmore [1967:14])
Gilmore (1967:14) identifies these items as some of the materials taken from
Mission San Sabá. If she is correct, then they made their way eastward quickly.
The single most important reason that Mission San Sabá failed is that the
Spanish had little understanding of the Native cultures they were dealing. They
had no idea how their actions with one group would change their relationships with
others. For example, the Spanish alliance with the Tejas tribes in the founding of the

411

412

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
east Texas missions caused severe anxiety and hatred among the Apache (Weddle
1964:31). Conversely, their attempt to place missions in the Apachería was seen as
a direct threat by all the enemies of the Apache, especially the allied Comanche and
Wichita nations. The eyewitness testimonies leave little doubt that the politics of
the Native American groups played a key role in the attack on the mission. Colonel
Ortiz Parrilla stated in his interrogation of Lieutenant Juan Galván: “The witnesses
agreed that the cause of the outbreak was the protection we have extended to the
Apaches, who are the enemies of the Comanches, Texas, Vidaes, Yujuanes, Tancagues,
and other nations from farther to the north” (Nathan and Simpson 2000:66). Joseph
Gutiérrez,79 a mission servant sent to warn the presidio early on the morning of the
attack, testified that he heard many of the attacking Indians say “they had come
with the intention of killing the Apaches.”
Language differences probably played a role in the Spaniards’ failure to
understand the Native cultures. In Missions, Missionaries, and Native Americans,
Maria Wade notes the impact that language interpretation problems had on the
interactions between the Native peoples and the missionaries. “Conversation was,
and is, about words, and despite the languages the priests learned, words failed them
because language is about culture” (Wade 2008:147). The extent to which language
problems exacerbated the Spanish mission failures in Texas is not fully known,
but that did have an impact at San Sabá. The Spanish did not understand that
the Apache were more interested in protection from the Comanche than religious
conversion.
The history of Mission San Sabá is complex, but the essence of the story
may be summed up in a single statement. In talking about the many mistakes the
Spanish made in their northern provinces, Gwynne (2010:62) writes that: “In an
era of grave misjudgments the greatest miscalculation of all took place in the year
1758.” There is no doubt that the Spanish were oblivious to the realities they faced
when they expanded their mission efforts to the Apache on the San Saba River.
They believed what they wanted to believe and failed to observe and properly
interpret the facts. Their blindness stemmed in large part from their attitude of
superiority over the Native peoples. The lessons learned from the 1758 attack and
the subsequent Spanish defeat during the 1759 retaliatory expedition may not have
lessened their arrogance, but they certainly made the Spaniards realize the fallacy
of their military superiority.

From the testimony, it seems that Gutiérrez understood the Tejas language. He overheard
conversations between the Tejas Indians and Father Terreros.

“[One should consider that] there are three hundred people in the thirty two tents of
Captain Chiquito and these tents are not bigger, they are not built differently or by a
different method, nor do they [indicate] a different lifestyle, but the same practiced by all
Apaches whereby three or four Indians and their families live in one tent, amounting to
about ten to twelve people [per tent] as we can perceive from the account of Captain
Chiquito and the thirty two tents in his immediate campground.”
“Before many days had passed, the Apaches returned to San Sabá with much buffalo
meat from their successful hunt, and the missionaries dared to let themselves hope again.
Though the Apaches stayed near the Mission for a few days, they refused to tarry longer.”
In about May 1757, “the Lipan Apache ‘Chief’ El Chico visited San Antonio and promised
Fr. Mariano de Dolores to assemble at San Sabá. Word was sent to other groups for the
same purpose, and in June the Lipan began to arrive at San Sabá from the south. During
the summer months, three thousand Apache gathered near the mission...[citing Dunn
1914:398]. Wooed by the missionaries with gifts and food, they stayed for a short while,
but made it clear they were on their buffalo hunt and were going on a campaign against
their northern enemies.”

Observation (includes direct quotes)
“Early in July it seemed as if Father Terreros’s faith was to be rewarded. Chief El Chico
appeared one day at the mission, his people loaded down with buffalo meat. ...but after
a short stay speedily continued their journey toward the south as if impelled by some
unseen danger.”
“Messengers were sent to search the neighboring country, and notify the different chiefs
of a great assembly to be held on the San Sabá. The Lipans were beginning to arrive
from the south, and by the middle of June about 3000 savages were encamped in the
vicinity of the missions [plural sic]...The Indians had not assembled in order to enter the
missions, but were merely on their annual buffalo hunt and ready for a campaign against
their perpetual enemies, the northern tribes... Chief El Chico pretended to be willing to
enter the missions, and a few other chiefs sided with him, but the majority supported Chief
Casablanca...”
“Without special protection, as if we were taking a regular walk, we rode our horses
through the large number of tents and many tents, I mean, gentile people camped near
us [military camp]. ...we returned to my tent, without having been able to count the people
who make up such an immense group of gentiles. We could not even count the tents they
inhabit because of their uneven and confusing distribution due to the hilly terrain where
many of them are located.”
“Captain Chiquito with three hundred people who make up the 32 field tents that adjoin
his tent are offering to settle as we have proposed. I am paying close attention to the said
Captain Casaca Blanca [also Casablanca] who, with another large number of Indians, is
preparing to march out and leave these surroundings as they proposed yesterday amid
the promises we reiterated to keep them in this Presidio, I mean, in this country, which is
destined to Missions.”
“Surreptitiously, we also counted all the tents present in the camp which amount to three
hundred and eleven. The number of horses and mules, according to the corporals and
other soldiers who are expert at making such observations, surpasses two thousand
seven hundred of one and anther kind. These observations were made in the field where
the animals were being pastured and the estimate should be considered conservative
because the total of the Indians, children and adults of both sexes, comprises the large
number of three thousand.”
“However, it is in this camp that they now gather.”

Observer
William Dunn

Sometime between their arrival in San Saba (March
1757) and July 4, 1757, the Apache stayed near the
mission for a few days.
(1) The missionaries gave the Indians food, perhaps
meaning domestic animals such as were found in the
Feature 10 bone cluster; (2) The Indians only stayed at
the mission for “a short while.”

The Spanish soldiers estimate there are at least 2,700
horses and mules with about 3,000 Apaches.

The paragraphs preceeding this entry reveal that Parrilla
is talking about an Apache campsite located somewhere
near Presidio San Sabá. This account differs from
others in that a large Apache camp was located near the
presidio, rather than near the mission.
Parrilla estimated there were 320-384 Indians in
Chiquito’s group.

This refers to an Apache camp near Parrilla’s military
camp, but where was this camp? Parrilla and the
missionaries did not count or estimate the number of
people or tents that made up the Ypande Apache camp,
implying that it was very large.

The Indians who gathered near the mission did not intend William Dunn
to stay. No sense of time is given for the duration of the
Apache camps near the mission.

Interpretive Notes
A group of Apaches did stop at the mission for a short
time in July 1757.

Observation (includes direct quotes)
“By the middle of June the hopes of the missionaries were suddenly raised. Three
thousand Apache had unexpectedly camped near the new mission which was awaiting
them. Joyously the padres went out to great them and to offer them presents. The Indians
received them sullenly...they were on a buffalo hunt and were preparing for a campaign
against the northern tribes.”
“This would result in a possible total of between 3,110 and 3,732 people. This total
appears to exclude Captain Chiquito’s 32 tents and his own, which would make 33 tents.”
Kay Hindes summarizing from Weddle: “…the Apaches visited [the mission] in large
numbers. The only two members of the tribe to live there for any period of time were two
ill ones left behind…”
After an Apache attack on San Antonio in 1731, the Spanish organized an expedition after
them. They found an encampment on the banks of a swollen river about seventy leagues
north of San Antonio. “The Apaches occupied over four hundred tents, which extended
along the river a mile and a half...”

“An occasional visit from straggling Apache bands was the only thing to break the
monotony.”
“The Apaches failed to appear in numbers. Those who came stayed only a few days on
their way south. All but Father Terreros lost faith in the Apaches’ sincerity and promises,
and two priests left. From time to time, groups of Apaches brought word that the
Comanches and Norteños (northern Indians) were gathering and headed in the direction
of the San Saba...”

This refers to a circular area where no vegetation would
grow in the field behind the Lyckman’s house. This is
an unusual occurrence and may denote some type of
historic feature.

1757) and July 4, 1757, the Apache brought buffalo to
the mission
Mark Wolf interpretation: “There’s something going on

Wade suggests that there were 3,110-3,732 Indians plus
Chiquito’s 300 people.
Many Apache camped near the mission for a short time,
but only two Apaches who were ill actually stayed in the
mission.
Bonilla describes a large Apache campsite seen in 1731
(20 years prior to the mission occupation) that was
located some 70 leagues north of San Antonio. Although
some exaggeration is possible, this older encampment
would be comparable in size to the large Apache camps
that were near the mission.
Apache stopped by at least a few times throughout the
summer of 1757, but they only stayed for a few daysn
each time.
Apache visited occasionally.

The Apache camped near the mission in the middle of
June.

Mark Wolf: “Due to the previous conversation with the landowner [Judge Lyckman], I
requested a test hole be dug in the depression near Johnson’s previous holes. This was
done with only mussel shell being found about 16” below surface. The soil was easily
removed (not compact).”

1954, to maintain and operate dams, reservoirs, lakes, wells, canals, flumes, laterals
and other functions necessary for the purpose of irrigation, milling, and stockraising. The
water for these operations was to come from the San Saba River by a ditch ‘commencing
4.5 miles above the town of Menardville, Menard County, Texas, on the south side of
the San Saba River, and extending five miles below the town of Menardville (Records of

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá

In 1901 letter, J. J. Callan described the mission, explaining that “a cow-man in 1863
converted it to a cowpen; tearing down the walls; the mission was on the east half...the
stones were all rough hewn or not hewn at all…and the mortar used was little more than
mud.” Two paragraphs later Callan added: “I would judge that the principal room marked
here was the mission chapel and the scene of the slaughter of the worshipers on that
bright June morning so long ago.”

Presidio

Acequia

Acequia

“Padre Giraldo [Terreros] was desirous of experimenting with what the lands promised,
and to moderate Don Pedro’s expenses in buying provisions, and bringing corn from San
Antonio. He wanted to clear a piece of land, for a small harvest, in spite of the fact that he
still did not have irrigation, and depended only on rainfall.” Colonel Parrilla thought it was a
bad idea to begin an irrigation ditch, but Terreros explained that it was his obligation to do
whatever it took to establish a mission. Father Terreros stated: “Since the planting of corn
was the principal means for founding the Mission, he needed to begin it.”
Mark Wolf: “I walked the entire length of the ‘acequia’ to determine its course and logic,
which became quite clear (it is obvious Harris Hollow was to be dammed up, creating a
small lake and also raising the level of Harris Hollow high enough (about 6 or 7 feet above
the existing bottom) to allow water to travel in the acequia which winds northeast in a loop
around the depression, ending in a southeastly [sic] direction and literally depositing into
the middle of the existing North field on Lyckman’s property. The acequia’s total length
is no greater than 400 yards...I then walked down to the old river bed and inspected [the
acequia’s] juncture with Harris Hollow. This occurs approx. 75 yards east of the east fence
of Lyckman’s southern alfalfa field, now dry.”
Mark Wolf: “And finally, don’t forget the ‘acequia,’ though stated as unfinished in 1760, has
the characteristics and profile of the presidio’s acequia, which was also dammed.”

These statements confirm that the confusion between
the mission and the presidio came very early on. Callan
is obviously describing the presidio and believed there
was a mission within its walls. These statements suggest
that Callan believed the mission and the presidio were
the same place. On a separate map drawn by Callan,
he labels the approximate mission location as “Presidio.
Smetler.”

Statement suggests the mission acequia was similar in
construction and function to the presidio acequia. This
would make sense because they were both built around
the same time.

Mark Wolf described the acequia as he observed it in
1993.

Father Trinidad states that there was no acequia at the
mission, but that Terreros argued that an acequia should
be dug in order to plant corn, a measure necessary to
establish the mission (see Mission Fields entry below).

This suggests that an irrigation ditch or acequia may
have once tapped into the river about one mile northwest
of the mission site, near the original location of the Texas
Centennial Mark for Mission San Sabá (before it was
moved to the actual mission site). In a later interview,
Jerry Rambo explained that this location was the site of
the Mamie Ditch Co. dam.

“All day long and far into the night the Indians continued their orgies…” The Spaniards
remained in the Father President’s room until noon, “when the flames reached them...”
They then moved to the “church building”…and later “into the small chapel...”
“At about eight o’clock in the morning the imprisoned men were startled to hear a
knocking at the door”…Joseph Vasquez, a soldier sent from the presidio, told a “wonderful
story of his escape”…after being attacked, falling off his horse, being attacked by Indians,
he crawled to the mission, “where he was discovered by two Indians, who siezed him
and pitched him into the burning stockade” and ...”had then made his way to the room,
unobserved by the feasting savages.”
“Parrilla sent out a sargeant with fourteen men and the Indians “feared attack from a
large[r] force, and cautiously withdrew to a more advantageous position.”
“As soon as the savages saw the priests appear and noted the confidence that was
place in their promises, many dismounted and without awaiting permission removed the
crossbars from the gate and flung it open.”

Kay Hindes research files contain a 1994 letter from Curtis Tunnell to Dr. Kathleen
Gilmore. In it, Tunnell discusses the meaning of the Spanish word “teja” which may
translate as some sort of tile or, conversely, adobe. Tunnell stated: “Jacal structures
further south in Mexico usually had steeply pitched roofs of thatch. However, jacals in
west Texas had very slightly pitched roofs (almost flat) covered with a thick layer of adobe
mud. Roof mud often had ash or lime added to make it more resistant to erosion. Could
such a roof have had the appearance of ceramic tile? Certainly it would have been very
resistant to fire!” Tunnell also noted that olive jar fragments were used as roofing material
in the Caribbean.
Soldier Luis Padilla stated that Father Terreros “saw no necessity to abandon [the
mission] and give up the care of his people and property. He said he thought the post well
protected by its stockade and by the roofs of the buildings, which were not thatched with
straw, but covered with tile to resist fire. The Mission was therefore better protected and
more secure than the Presidio itself, for the buildings of the latter have roofs of reeds or
straw, and its stockade is very long, necessitating a large number of men for its defense.”
“The effigy of the Holy Saint Francis had been overturned and the head severed from the
body.” The soldiers took the “image” with them back to the Presidio “as well as some bars
of iron and several iron griddles and copper vessels.”
Kay Hindes: “James Cannon-Jack Rogers/ City manager has original documents that
belong to Jack Rogers; John [Kniffen] says I need to take a look at these/ Rogers has a
bell that he says he found at the mission site- our site not the presidio; Ila Mae says it is
brass perhaps/ According to John, Jack says that there were three bells at the mission.”
Mariah Wade summarizing Leal: “When the Indians attacked, Juan Leal was at the river
getting some wood for the planting...”

This suggests that the attacking Indians could open the
1757
gate from the outside of the stockade. Was it so short that
they could reach over and remove the crossbars from
the gate?

The attacking Indians left the area after dark.

The attacking Indians stayed around the mission for the
rest of the day; the surviving Spanish moved from room
to room, ending up in the small chapel.
This statement suggests this sequence of events: (1)
The attacking Indians showed up at about 7 am; (2) the
initial phase of the massacre was over by 8 am; (3) the
stockade was burning and the attacking Indians were
feasting.

Juan Leal was cutting wood by the river intended for the
planting of a small crop- possibly just a small garden
within the mission compound.

This statement suggests that at least one of the mission
structures had a roof made of “tile.” This statement quite
controversial, with much of the dispute centered on the
translation of Teja as Tile. with Gilmore in relocating the
site--and resulted in a letter stating the translation of the
word “tile.”
After the massacre, soldiers recovered some important
religious and other items from the mission.
A brass bell (or bells?) was recovered from the mission,
and someone in Menard may still have it.

This suggests that the roofs of some of the mission
buildings could have been made of lime-baked mud or
mud painted with a lime whitewash. Perhaps the Father
President’s quarters had such a roof, and it had the
appearance of a tile or adobe roof.

Following the attack, four people were buried in the
mission cemetery (Father Terreros, Father Santiestaban,
and two soldiers). Other soldiers were buried where they
were found.

Three more burials were between the mission and
the northern ford. Mark Wolf thinks these graves were
exhumed and reburied elsewhere.

“The first care was given to the burial of the dead. The following had been killed: Fathers
Terreros and Santiesteban, Joseph García, Enrique Gutiérrez, Lazaro de Ayala, Asencio
Cadena, Andres de Villareal, and Juan Antonio Gutiérrez, who had succumbed to his
wounds. The bodies of Father Terreros and two soldiers were buried in the church
cemetery. The others were interred at the places where their remains were found. Joaquín

unable to escape the flames. Under this impression they busied themselves with pillage
and plunder all that day and all the next night, guarding the gates and the roads to the
Presidio, except the one to the east, which they left unguarded, and it was through it that
our people escaped.”

There is confusion in the record as to the number of
attacking Indians present, ranging from 400 to 2,000.

Population of the mission at the time of the massacre
was 17. However, Weddle (1964:70) states that Dunn
(1914) and Castañeda (1936) are incorrect.
“There were 17 people in the mission between soldiers and Indians. This, however, is not There were as many as 40 people at the mission at the

at the time of the attack. Hindes et al. 1995 shows 31, but there were Native women and
children who escaped and are not part of the count. One can assume upwards of 40
people if not more.”
This statement should account for everyone at the

notes that Nicolas, the driver, is not mentioned here.
From the Declaracion juridica del Padre Molina (Page 12): “The total number of persons There were 17 people at the mission on the day of the
attack.
[at the mission the morning of the massacre] reached only seventeen, including four or
five Indian servants.”

“Cabello, writing in 1784, said that the invaders numbered 700 (Informe, 46). Bonilla gives
the number as 2000 (Breve Compendio, 26). Some Orcoquizac Indians later declared
that there had been only about 400 (Parilla to Dolores, May 22, 1758, 9), but this is
probably an underestimate.”
“From the ground that they occupied, it was estimated that the number of Indians reached
2000, which, according to Father Molina, was a conservative estimate. He believed that at
least 1,000 bore firearms.”
Father Terreros agreed to go with the Teja Chief to the presidio. “True to his word, the
brave father prepared to start, accompanied by a soldier named Joseph García. When
they were ready, the chief could not be seen, and Father Terreros, thinking to find him in
the throng outside of the stockade, rode toward the gate. As the two men drew near a
shot rang out, and with a cry Father Terreros fell from his horse, mortally wounded. At the
same time, a murderous volley from the savages instantly killed Garcia.”
From his interrogation of Juan Galvan and other noncommissioned officers and soldiers,
Colonel Parrilla reported that 17 Indians were killed in the massacre. He is referring to the
attacking Indians who were killed as reported by eyewitnesses.
“There were seventeen persons in all at San Sabá, including the three missionaries, the
five soldiers, and the Tlascalteca Indians.”

These observations suggest that there were as many as

various native groups that attacked the mission.

Juan Leal

May find artifact fragments of these big jars.

In a letter from Col. Parrilla to Father Dolores, Parrilla notes that Father Molina gave a
“conservative estimate” of the number Indians as 2000, and stated that Father Molina
“believed that at least 1000 bore firearms.” Citing this letter and other sources, Dunn
notes that most of the attacking Indians were “probably Comanches, but there were
also present many Tejas, Tancagues, Vidaes, Yujuanes, and other tribes who professed
friendship for the Spaniards in eastern Texas.”
Asencio Cadena “recognized representatives of the Tejas, Vidaes, Tancagues, and other
northern tribes with whom he had often been associated.”

Father Molina

This suggests that the attacking Indians had firearms as
well as spears and sabres.

Dunn quoted from the Declaracion juridica del Padre Molina (Pages 1-3): “All appeared
to be armed with guns, sabres, or spears. A number of small boys were present for the
purpose of receiving practical instruction in the art of warfare.”

“[Colonel Parrilla] urged [the priests] to give up working in the fields until the threat [of an
attack] had passed.”

Kay: “When the Spanish mission was here and they were going to farm and have some
fields where do you think they would have gone?” Jerry: “ It’s hard to say, all of this land
is so fertile in here.” Kay: “South?” Jerry: “Well that, and these fields back this away are
fertile too [points to Lyckman’s alfalfa field].” Jenny: “Just south of the river then?” Jerry:
confirms...”I would say over this creek here [Harris Hollow]. They was probably farming
that hill up there and this one right in here [Lyckman’s].”
“For these reasons, I let the Fathers follow their wishes, and I did not oppose the [will] of
the Father President to sow four or five fanegas of corn, as it can be seen today by the
land he had cleared for that purpose, even before having Indians in the mission or being
certain that he [they] would remain here.”

Mission Fields
- Cleared for
Planting Corn

After the disagreement between Parrilla and Terreros on whether to dig an acequia and
start corn fields, Terreros adds (via Trinidad), “In order to carry out the task asked in such
a short time, without experience in these lands, and whether the climate was or was
not appropriate, he did not have much hopes of a harvest. With these explanations the
Captain [Parilla] was satisfied, and refrained from contradicting him.’

Mariah Wade notes: “...the fence (stockade) had four sides (a las quatro partes de
la estacada), confirming that the compound was fully enclosed by the stockade. The
‘inside’ patio may have been formed by the layout of the buildings and further delineated
by a second fence. This is a possibility, but likely it did not cover all the area, otherwise
Basques (Vasquez), who got his hand scorched by being thrown into the burning
stockade, would state that he was thrown beyond two fences or ended up between two
fences.”
Based on various lines of evidence, Mark Wolf believes that corrals were adjacent to
the west side of the mission compound. Notes taken from an aerial photograph show a
rectangular area of lighter-colored soil ( “9/17/year unknown”).
Mark Wolf from Nathan and Simpson: Parrilla desired Terreros “to devote himself primarily
to the conversion of the Apache Indians and give up such enterprises as the cultivation of
the soil and other agricultural labors...”

Wade interprets Molina’s statement as evidence that
there may have been two sets of stockade walls, possibly
consisting of the outer stockade and the inner “courtyard”

Land was cleared for 4-5 fenegas of corn. Based on this, Colonel Parrilla May 22, 1758 Wade 2007:206
McWilliams calculates a fanega to 8.81 acres (Almaráz
1980:15 cited in McWilliams 2001:196). Thus, this
statement suggests that 35-44 acres were cleared for
corn. It appears that no corn had actually been planted,
but the field was cleared and ready for planting.

In order to avoid a fight, Father Trinidad said that Father
Terreros expected little from his first harvest, and so
an acequia was begun. As a result of this exchange,
Trinidad wrote a letter to his friend asking that he come
and help [with the acequia and the planting of fields?].
Trinidad reports that the letter was dated November 8,
1857. Thus, it appears that the excavation of the mission
acequia had begun by this time.
Robert Weddle March 15,
Weddle (1964:70) cites this as Padilla’s testimony that

fields were being prepped and/or planted. However, there
are no references to “fields” in Padilla’s testimony as
translated by Nathan and Simpson (2000:95-97).

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá

Observation (includes direct quotes)
Mariah Wade summarizing Parrilla: “The day of the attack Fr. Alonso Giraldo de Terreros
planned on sowing 4-5 fanegas of corn, and he had cleared the ground for the planting
even before there were any Indians in the mission (for confirmation see Juan Leal’s
deposition).”
Kay Hindes notes: “Based on profiles of acequia, known crossings near presidio, the
swale at the pecan tree across the site [north of 41MN23] and at fenceline of Harris
Hollow could have been used for crossing for mission.”
Hindes plotted the location of a probable Spanish
crossing (or ford) over Harris Hollow on an annotated
map.

“In the lonely mission lived the three friars with a guard of five soldiers, eight or ten faithful
Tlascalteca families, and a few Indian servants. Early in January a friar [Molina] from the
College of San Fernando arrived” …and on January 12, 1758, Santísima Trinidad was
sent to Mexico City “leaving only three missionaries at San Sabá.”
Mission Layout “The usual plan of mission settlement was followed. Quarters for the priests, storerooms
for the supplies, a rude church, and stables were erected. Among them a strong stockade
was built, entered through a large gate secured by bars. Toward the river, plots of land
were laid out, and crops planted.”
Mission Layout Quoting from the Ynstruccion Historia (Vol. 95:125-127), Dunn states: “The buildings
should be constructed of native timber, with the usual economy, and when the plans had
been decided upon they should be submitted to the viceroy for his approval.”
Mission Layout “The Mission San Saba was not destitute of means of defense. It consisted of a spacious
wooden building, which was used as a church, and a number of log houses, which served
as residences for the missionaries, soldiers’ quarters, and store rooms. The whole was
surrounded by a strong palisade with only one doorway, which opened upon an enclosed
patio or small square protected by two swivel guns.”

while the courtyard’s a specific place.”

Mission Layout Mark Wolf from Nathan and Simpson: “As soon as the wily enemy became aware of the
confidence we placed in them, many dismounted and, without waiting for us unlock the
gates, opened them by wrenching off the crossbars with their hands. This done, they
crowded into the inner stockade, as many of them as it would hold, about 300, a few more
or less...Father Terreros and the soldier Gutiérrez looked for the Indian chief whom they
were supposed to ride off with but could not find him among the ‘rabble that thronged the
courtyard’.”
Mission Layout On March 15, Parrilla went to the mission to ask Terreros to come to the presideio.
Terreros pulled the Colonel aside “and talked to me at great length near the quarters of
the Indians.”
Mission Layout Father Santiesteban’s head was found later [than March 24th, 1758], in the ruins of the
clothing storehouse…they also found and hid one kettle, one iron bar, and three axes.

Spanish troops covered the San Saba Valley in the
vicinity of the project area prior to founding the mission
and presidio. They camped throughout the area
and there may be a chance of finding small historic
campsites. There were at least 74 members of this party

“On April 22, moved upriver on the south side about 4 leagues [10.6 miles]. There were
no open paths because the area was forested and with thorny plants. They found some
small springs that issued from the hills and flowed to the river. Moving upriver four leagues
they found that it flowed through a canyon (encajonado) from its headwaters to the 4
leagues covered. Realizing this, and fearful of Indian attack they returned to camp on the
north side. They found the area they traveled through to the camp less forested and hilly
and also with some places appropriated to draw water for irrigation…”
“Apache Captain Chico [also called Tacu and Chiquito] arrived with many of his people
and camped within the presidial campground with some space in between them and
the Spanish. Parrilla gave them 3 head of cattle to be butchered. Most Apache arrived
through paths that led to the presidial campground but either passed or visited the friars
on their way to camp. Others came through another path and did not see the friars; thus
Parrilla wanted them to meet the friars and to be able to have some idea of how many
Apache had gathered. For those purposes, Parrila asked the friars to meet him in his tent
at the presidial camp the following morning.”
“Rained all night and morning so the friars got to Parrilla’s tent at about 3:00 pm. They all
traveled on horseback amongst the camp full of tents. The number of tents (tiendas) was
very large but the Spanish did not manage to count the tents because they are not alike
and were dispersed due to the nature of the terrain. The Apache had many horses and
mules and Parrilla knew he could get an idea of the number of Apache by counting the
beasts, but he did not want to count them for fear the Apache would react with distrust.
The following morning Parrila went to the missionary camp with the Apache chiefs, and
from that camp they went to survey the lands designated for the missions.”
“Surveyed the springs and the land for farms and buildings…. Selected sites for two
missions on each side of the river but separated ½ league…They also chose the camping
area for the presidial troops 1 ½ leagues from said places.”

Mark Wolf observed a narrow strip of land--probably an old wagon trail that led down to
the river for picnicing in the 1910s-1920s--between the Lyckman and Rambo properties

There were many roads between the mission and

The route of FM 2092 followed a wagon road before it
was gravel, and the wagon road tied into another road
near Five Mile Crossing and went northward to Brady.

Jenny: “Do you know if this road today [FM 2092] follows and old wagon road?” Jerry:
“Oh yeah, it was a wagon road at one time or another because my great grandparents
owned 80 sections of land up here [to the north] and the wagon road that they used back
in there [later he adds that this was in the 1910-1920s and in the 1800s] has got where
the wagon wheel wore the stone out and the print of the wagon wheels is still there - in the
stone. But there in Mr. Clark’s ranch over there. ...That road came from...here [see map]...
to the Brady Highway I’m guessing about 5 miles across there and it’s through Mr. Clark’s
ranch there .... and that was the road that they used to go to Brady.” Jenny “And was that
the same road as it is today?” Jerry: “ No, huh-uh.” Jenny “It crossed right here by 5 mile
crossing.” Kay: “Did it tie into this highway?” Jerry goes on to explain that the stage coach
stop [referred to as Splittgerber’s (Pierce1946:165) was on the road to Mason and that’s
where the old wagon road headed.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá

Mark Wolf from Nathan and Simpson: Colonel Parrilla mentioned soldiers “who had come
to scout and follow trails to the east, below the Mission post.” Parrilla (p. 41) called it a
“post designed as a mission.” Mark Wolf notes: “Military view implying the appearance
was closer to that of a presidio, hence the stockade.”
Mark Wolf from Pierce: During the massacre “the Indians who, fearful lest reinforcements
from the presidio should arrive, gave all their attention to the roads and the fields.”

During the massacre: “After the little party had escaped from the church, each one
followed the road he thought less dangerous. Father Molina took a southerly direction,
always looking for unfrequented roads and unknown paths.”
Mark Wolf from Nathan and Simpson: “From there he could see that all roads to the
Presidio were crowded with great numbers of Indians, who also completely surrounded
the Mission post.”

Mission Roads

Mariah Wade notes: “...Natives were more concerned in covering the roads toward the
Presidio, leaving the east path unprotected which was the route used for the escape
which took place in groups” or “dexando la otra del oriente sin cuidado que fue la que les
sirvio para hacer la fuga divididos los unos de los otros.”
Mission Setting Mariah Wade summarizing from Parrilla: “From the Presidio camp they proceeded close
to the river and on the south side; covered 4 leagues (10.4 miles) and marked that point
with a cross. The land was rugged with stony hills, dry pasture and no wood trees useful
for construction. Stopped at noon. In the afternoon they continued the survey near the
river; moved more than 1 league [over 2.6 miles] upriver on both north and south sides
and found 2 very good and abundant places to draw water for irrigation. These places
also had good sources of wood for construction [maderas] stone, reeds [tule] and plenty
of land for farming. They returned to the Presidio campgrounds.”
Mission Setting Mariah Wade summarizing from Parrilla: “The following day [April 20] they departed from
the Presidio campgrounds to the place they call The Cross of Theran because Governor
[of Coahuila] Don Pedro de Rabago y Theran planted a cross on that spot. They found
that cross engraved on an oak tree more or less two leagues [from their campground].
The land they traveled through was between the hills and the river, flat, and with mesquite
bushes. This area had walnut or pecan [nogales], elm [olmo] and some oak. Because of
these conditions it was not considered appropriated to set up camp. Thus, they continued
upriver, about one league [2.6 miles] and found the same conditions and resources. They
forded the river to the north side, stopped near the ford in a flat area which had less trees
and smaller oaks than those seen previously. They also found pastureland for the horse
herd, but it was dry despite the 2 small arroyos that run through it. [this sounds like the
place where later the Indian attackers stopped to divide the spoils of the attack].”

we looked and did not find them. A spring once flowed from the bank, he recalled, but
indications were it had silted up.”

Interpretive Notes
This observation hints at how the Indians burned the
stockade. If the structures in the mission had tatched
roofs, it would have been easty to set them on fire and
the thatch would burn hot enough to ignite the stockade
wall if it were nearby. This suggests that the outer
stockade was some distance away from the buildings.

Wolf notes: “We know of three clusters of structures,

There were small houses or huts somewhere near the
mission. Since other testimonials state that they were
cutting reeds down by the river, this suggests that these
houses were by the river. If the river was further north at
the time of the mission occupation, these buildings may
have been destroyed by the meandering river channel.

Funding for the “ditch” came from the U.S. government
in the form of “three sections of land to the mile of ditch.”
The government stated the size of the ditch. The Texas
Rangers guarded the construction of the first ditch.
Although no date is given in this excerpt, the Rangers
were camped east of Menard from 1875 to 1877.
However, less likely, it could have been when they were
camped near Ft. McKavett in 1878.

“Godfrey said he could also show several places on Celery Creek where the Spaniards
quarried rock with which the fort was built.”
Mark Wolf from Nathan and Simpson: “To the livestock ranch five leagues to the west
(of the presidio), which supplies provisions for the Presidio...11 men at livestock ranch 5
leagues west [of presidio].” Mark Wolf concluded: “Thus, did the mission have it’s own
rancho? I think so.” Wolf calculated the distance as “5x2.63 = 13.15 miles up river.”
Mariah Wade summarizing Flores: “...the ranch of the Presidio was 5 leagues por la parte
del poniente and had eleven people... Thus, what is called the cattle ranch of the Presidio
is actually the ranch that had the cattle from and for the mission, and it was located about
13 miles west of the Presidio...”
Kay Hindes: “Walter Russel place- when his grandfather came to this place there was a
rock wall ca. 3 miles long, 3’ thick, 6’ high still there- “a drift fence” which kept livestock
from wondering away. Some stones still there- along dry creek (runs water) - Supposed to
be location of remains- a couple of stone ruins-”. Possibly related to previous page note:
“Two ranches ca. 15 miles west of town.”
Kay Hindes: “Mr. Rambo had pictures of rock art (petroglyphs) [arrows] that are on

Kay Hindes went to visit this rock art site with Jerry

The presidio ranch was also the mission’s ranch.

This refers to historic rock quarries located along Celery
Creek.
This implies the existence of a separate rancho to

There is a large prehistoric site on Jerry Rambo’s land
north of the river.

Prehistoric Site Jerry Rambo: “The old Indian campgrounds were over on the north side down there
through my place. There were some big campgrounds- Indian campgrounds. And I go
over there a lot and I’m plowing up arrow heads and different types of stone and stuff...
grinding stones...and I’ve got the big cup in it [matate].”
Presidio
“When the Republic of Texas came into the Union of the States, she reserved all her
Acequia
public domain, and appropriated it to the upbuilding of the state, in public institutions
and school funds. And ‘Uncle Sam’ was not more liberal in giving the people homes. I
think it was the Fourteenth Legislature that offered land subsidy, to encourage irrigation,
specifying the dimensions of a ditch to carry the water, say six feet wide, at the bottom of
the ditch, and twelve feet wide, from cut to cut across the top, and four feet deep, on level
ground. For this class of ditch, the state offered three sections of land to the mile of ditch,
not otherwise appropriated, to the makers of that grade of ditches. The state not reserving
any rental, or any further claim on the enterprise. Under this covenant, between the state
and the citizen we had the pleasure of seeing the first ditch made, and stood guard for the
workers in their happy vocation.”
Presidio Dam Kay Hindes: “An old Spanish dam: on the Jack Walston place ca. 1st rock house on the
left leaving town/ saw stones himself- associated with a gristmill- here when the early
settlers came in- ‘some dressed stones’/ one farthest west is not in good shape- The one
farthest east- can still see-”
Presidio Fields “The Indians did not dare assault the fort, and contented themselves with burning the
isolated buildings and destroying the newly planted crops.”
Presidio Fields “In honor of the viceroy the presidio was named San Luis de las Amarillas, but it was
usually known as the presidio of San Sabá. In accordance with the viceroy’s instructions,
the soldiers were assigned land to cultivate, and the soil was prepared for the sowing of
grain. By May 4 [1757] most of these activities were well under way...”

There were isolated buildings and fields with crops
growing near the presidio or the mission.
This implies that planting was well underway (or so the
Viceroy wanted) as soon as the group arrived at San
Sabá. However, this statement only mentions the crops
planted by the soldiers near the presidio, and it does not
mention the mission.
During the massacre “the Indians who, fearful lest reinforcements from the presidio should Fields (plural) were present near the presidio.

Humpy Jackson would “conceal himself on one of the many peeks overlooking the road
…. And before [the African American soldiers] got by [another one was killed]. It is even
asserted that the road from Fort McKavett to Menardville is dotted with the negro graves,
victims of his terrible vengeance, but, of course, this boast on the part of his friends is an
exaggeration, and I doubt his ever having killed more than one or two from ambush...”

Captain Dan Roberts “took Mrs. Roberts up to Menardville, where we were to take our
Ranger quarters for the winter...I prepared quarters for us, about one and one-half miles
from the town, and we soon went into camp. Here we spent our honey-moon, with sweet
old King Nature, watching the wild ducks and geese splash in the beautiful water of the
San Saba River.” [He goes on to describe the wildlife.]

Mariah Wade summarizing from Parrilla: “[April 19, 1757] From the Presidio camp they
proceeded close to the river and on the south side; covered 4 leagues (10.4 miles) and
marked that point with a cross. The land was rugged with stony hills, dry pasture and no
wood trees useful for construction. Stopped at noon. In the afternoon they continued the
survey near the river; moved more than 1 league [over 2.6 miles] upriver on both north
and south sides and found 2 very good and abundant places to draw water for irrigation.
These places also had good sources of wood for construction [maderas] stone, reeds
[tule] and plenty of land for farming. They returned to the Presidio campgrounds.”
Mariah Wade summarizing from Parrilla: “The following day [April 20] they departed from
the Presidio campgrounds to the place they call The Cross of Theran because Governor
[of Coahuila] Don Pedro de Rabago y Theran planted a cross on that spot. They found
that cross engraved on an oak tree more or less two leagues [from their campground].
The land they traveled through was between the hills and the river, flat, and with mesquite
bushes. This area had walnut or pecan [nogales], elm [olmo] and some oak. Because of
these conditions it was not considered appropriated to set up camp. Thus, they continued
upriver, about one league [2.6 miles] and found the same conditions and resources. They
forded the river to the north side, stopped near the ford in a flat area which had less trees
and smaller oaks than those seen previously. They also found pastureland for the horse
herd, but it was dry despite the 2 small arroyos that run through it. [this sounds like the
place where later the Indian attackers stopped to divide the spoils of the attack].”
Jenny: “What do you think about the possibility of there being a silver mine out here? Do
you think there’s any truth to it?” Jerry: “Well, they’ve always talked about it. And I sold
hay to the people that had the property where they claim the old mine was. It’s about 8-12
miles west of Menard. [Jerry took Kay there] It’s an egg shaped hole in the ground [with
arrows pointing to it- see photos in Kay’s files].
Mark Wolf notes that de Zavala letters state: “Hundreds of prospectors…have been
here from time to time within the past fifty years…[looking for] the lost mine and hidden
treasure. But none ever succeeded in finding anything to indicate the presence of either,
excepting the remains of the smelter, some crusibles [sic], a few small slabs of lead
containg a considerable per centum of silver, some tools and impliments [sic] and parts of
human bones.”
“When I was a boy, my daddy and I used to come down here to the springs down here
[at the far east end of Judge Lyckman’s field]. It flowed then somewhere about 12-1400
gallons a minute. It was a big spring. But then in somewhere’s about 1925 [or 1945?] the
river re-channeled in here. And when it re-channeled there why then it took this part of the
river where the spring was off. And then every time the river flooded why then it washed
the mud and silt in on the spring. ...It filled it in with mud and silt and it closed it. But the
springs seep out from there at the springs all the way down to my camp house. They
come out all along the river banks. And so they’re filtering back into the river. But [at] the
main spring there, it really flowed a stream out there.”
Jerry Rambo learned to swim in the bend in the river just below the spring. His
grandmother Rambo took him down there. Right above his river crossing.

Capt. Dan Roberts made a home for himself and his
Roberts

downstream, near the Rangers camp. If their quarters

In the early twentieth century, some locals believed that J. J. Callan
there was a smelter (presumably a place where ore
was smelted to recover precious metals) was located
in the general area of the mission. This is probably a
misinterpretation, and the location they believed was a
smelter was actually the mission.
The spring at the bend in the river just east of the mission Jerry Rambo
site once pumped 1,200-1,400 gallons per minute.
According to Rambo, the river changed course in about
1925 (noting that the audiotape is unclear and he could
have said 1945).

Rambo believes the silver mine is 8-12 miles west of the

Terán noted ample wood for building such as walnut, elm, Rábago y

This probably meant that he used the stump of a tree as Terreros

constructing buildings or the stockade at the mission.

Walnut and elm trees were common, oaks less so.

“On June 29, with rheumatic pains shooting through his arm and crumpling his fingers,

Terán “set out from San Antonio on December 23, 1754, to explore Apache country” and
found “an ample supply of lumber including walnut, elm, cottonwood and live oak. There

Appendix B: Inventory of Supplies for the Mission San Sabá
INTRODUCTION
The Inventory of Supplies is an original Spanish document written in 1756–1757. It was
an official record of all of the supplies purchased and the money spent in Mexico City and in
other places on the journey to the San Saba River for the founding of the mission there. This
document was first transcribed and translated into English in 1995 by Dennis (1995a). As part
of the FM 2092 project, the Inventory reanalyzed and retranslated by Mariah F. Wade and
Jennifer K. McWilliams in 2011. The Inventory is discussed in detail in Chapter 14, and this
appendix provides the supporting documents, which include the 1995 original transcription and
translation and the 2011 retranslation, along with corresponding research notes by Wade and
McWilliams and a glossary of Spanish terms.
INVENTORY OF SUPPLIES FACSIMILE AND TABLES
This section includes the facsimile of the Inventory and three data tables. The individual
components are as follows:
•

Facsimile Document. A facsimile of the original handwritten Inventory of
Supplies, 1756–1757, from the Microfilms of the Celaya Archives, Roll 9, Old
Spanish Missions Research Library, Our Lady of the Lake University, San Antonio,
Texas. The facsimile is 16 pages long, with the Celaya Archives microfilm pages
being numbered 2801 to 2816. Four additional pages of the document are present
in the microfilm (2817 to 2820), but these are largely illegible and are not included
in the facsimile reproduced in this appendix.

•

Table B.1. Original 1995 transcription and translation of the Inventory of
Supplies with 2011 retranslation. This table contains the line-by-line Spanish
transcription and the first English translation by Dennis in 1995. The Spanish
transcription is from unpublished notes by Dennis (1995c), and the translation is
from Dennis (1995a). This table also contains the 2011 retranslation by Wade and
McWilliams along with their research notes and observations.

•

Table B.2. Accounting of items in the Inventory of Supplies organized by
functional group. This table contains a list of objects identified in the Inventory
sorted into functional groups. In her thesis describing the Mission San Sabá material
culture, McWilliams (2001:112–133) defined a set of functional groups that aided
her analysis. Those functional groups have been modified slightly for this study,
and the functional groups and subgroups used in Table B.2 are listed below. This
classification was helpful in the current study, and it is included here as an aid for
future researchers. The “Payment” category was particularly useful for sorting data
to calculate total expenditures.

Table B.3. Salvaged items from Mission San Sabá organized by functional
category. A table listing all the of items that were salvaged from the burned mission
site by Colonel Ortiz Parrilla and his soldiers four days after the attack. This list
was originally published in Gilmore (1967:37–43). The original Spanish document
translated by Gilmore is from the Archives of Conde de Regla, 1756–1759, but
Gilmore translated from transcripts (pages 106–109) housed at the Archives of the
Marqués de San Francisco in Mexico City (Gilmore 1967:37). The list of contains
minor retranslations and some research notes by Mariah Wade, who reexamined
this salvage list in 2010. Each of the items listed as having been salvaged should
appear in the Inventory of Supplies (Table B.1), unless it was a personal item that
belonged to an individual. The introductory statement to the list of items salvaged,
as translated by Gilmore (1967:37), is as follows: “Records of the personal effects
which were found respective to the administration and management of the deceased
R P. Fray Alonso Giraldo de Terreros, after his untimely death.” The Spanish
transcription ends with the phrase “Cuatro rubricas” which is translated as “Four
signatures.” Since Gilmore translated the transcript, rather than the original
document or a facsimile, the identities of the four signers are not known. The list of
salvaged items ordered into the following functional groups:
Animal Husbandry
Animal – Horse
Animal – Mule
Animal – Ox
Animal – Plow Animals
Animal – Small Livestock
Carpentry
Culinary
Defense/Hunting
Ecclesiastic

Two methodological notes are warranted here. During the current analysis, the line-byline numbering that appears in Tables B.1 and B.2 matches the line numbering in the original
handwritten Spanish document and the subsequent transcription and translations. The line
numbering used herein does not correspond to the line numbering used in the first analysis of
the Inventory of Supplies by McWilliams (2001:Appendix B), but the tables in this appendix
supercede that original analysis. In all of the tables that follow, the references to “RAE” refer
to the Real Academia Española, which is the official royal institution overseeing the Spanish
language. The RAE also maintains an online compilation of historical and modern Spanish
dictionaries dating from 1726 to 1992 (see References Cited).
GLOSSARY OF TRANSLATED SPANISH TERMS
Compiled by Jennifer K. McWilliams
This glossary is a selection of Spanish words and English translations compiled from a
variety of different sources. It contains Spanish words that appear in the Inventory of Supplies, as
well as in other Spanish colonial documents, along with the corresponding English translations.
The original version was created and published by McWilliams (2001:Appendix F), but many
new entries have been added since then.
The entries pertain to a wide range of subjects relating to life in Spanish colonial missions,
and many of the words and phrases relate to the material culture—objects such as ecclesiastic
supplies, ironworks, and ceramics. Additionally, it includes terms for flora and fauna, and these
were often influenced by native words from Nahuatl and other borderland Indian languages.
Where appropriate, comments by Wade or McWilliams are inserted into the definitions.
Many of the definitions are taken directly from the vocabulary listing by Dennis (1995d)
compiled in conjunction with his translations of the Inventory (Dennis 1995a, 1995c) and the
Revenge of the San Sabá (Dennis 1995b). Additional sources include:
•

Hindes’s (1998) work on the original “Herrera” gates at the Alamo;

•

Almaráz’s (1980) Inventory of the Rio Grande Missions: 1772,; San Juan Bautista
and San Bernardo;

•

Leutenegger’s (1994) Guidelines for a Texas Mission: Instructions of the Missionary
of Mission Concepción;

•

Marken’s (1994) work on Spanish Armada pottery;

•

Simmons and Turley’s (1980) study of colonial ironwork;

•

Foster’s (1995a, 1995b) appendixes listing the fauna and flora observed by Spanish
explorers in Texas between 1689 and 1768.

This glossary also contains some words and phrases translated by Wade and McWilliams
during their 2011 reanalysis of the Inventory. Consequently, some entries may make sense only
within the context of the Inventory. An example is the word “piedras,” which normally means

485

486

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
“rocks.” In the context as it appears in the Inventory, however, piedras most likely means a

alfalfa – alfalfa (Foster 1995b:247).
alhaja – in the colonial period, alhaja connoted a valuable ornament or a fine piece if furniture, highly

arroba – a measure of liquid equal to about 12.5 liters (Marken 1994:243).
arroba – a unit of weight equivalent to 25 pounds (Almaráz 1980:5).
asperges – the blessing with holy water given to the celebrant before Mass (Leutenegger 1994:53).
Mariah Wade (personal communication 2011) notes that it is the celebrant who uses the water

baptizar: 4 campanillas y 4 platillos y vinageras,” translated as “8 cassimeres: 2 bivalves or
sea shells used for baptizing: 4 small bells and 4 plates and altar cruets.” Cassimires may be a
misspelling, slang, or localized word (Mariah Wade, personal communication 2011).
castaño – chinquapin, probably Castanea, found in east Texas and not the American chestnut
(Castanea dentata) (Foster 1995b:249– 250).
castor – beaver (Foster 1995a:236).
catechumens – persons undergoing instruction in the rudiments of Christianity; neophytes (Almaráz
1980:32).
cavazear – Dennis (1995c:86) could not translate this word. Wade notes that in Portuguese cavazear
means to doze or sleep. In the context of the Inventory, cavazear possibly refers to leather for
beds. During Spanish colonial times, beds were more like cots with leather stretched over a
wooden frame. However, Mariah Wade (personal communication 2011) also notes the word
means balancing, as in ballast on a ship.
cazo – copper saucepan or kettle (Dennis 1995d:86); copper vessel shaped like a half orange with a
rim that has a large iron handle to remove the vessel from the fire. Mariah Wade (personal
communication 2011) believes the vessel was skillet-like and used to cook eggs, fish, and other
things (vaso de cobre ù de azosar en forma de media naranja en cujo borde suele tener clavado
un mango largo de hierro para sacarle de la lumbre, y sirve para cocer huevos, pescado y otras
cosas) (RAE A 1729:247, 1). In some places, the name is given to an iron or copper ladle used to

(Hindes 1998:40).
cimarrón – any bulb-type plant (Leutenegger 1994:52).
cingulo – cord for tying the priest’s alb (Dennis 1995d:86).

cirial – candlestick (Dennis 1995d:86).
ciriales – large candlesticks, for Catholic processions (RAE A 1729:360, 1).
ciruela – plum (Prunus mexicana) (Foster 1995b:257).
cobalonge (cavalonge) – word is diffficult to translate and may be slang or localized. The entry in
the Inventory is “20 cabalongas para matar animales” (20 cabalongas for killing animals).
However, the word cuchillos is used later “for killing cattle,” suggesting cabalongas is referring
to a different tool for killing animals. The root, coba, means money, chicken, or a coin or
hammered copper or other metal. However, the only dictionary entry (covalonga) refers to a
plant whose seeds replaced quinine (RAE U 1925:350,3). Furthermore, with regard to Native
American botanical uses, Sturtevant (1954:320) notes that the quinine (Persea borbonia in the
Lauracea) was used in livestock for the purpose of aborting a fetus up to about four months
old.
cocodrilo (caimán) – alligator (Foster 1995a:233–234).
codorniz – quail (Foster 1995a:242).

coralillos – corral snake (Foster 1995a:244).
cordobon – leather from a goat (RAE U 1925:338, 3). The Inventory lists 9 pares de botas de cordovan
originally translated as Cordovan boots (Dennis 1995a:72). However, in this particular case,
cordovan refers specifically to boots made of goat leather. This word did not enter the official
Spanish dictionary until 1925 (Mariah Wade, personal communication 2011).
corporal – a fine altar cloth, usually of linen, on which the communion bread and wine are put to be
consecrated during the Eucharist (Almaráz 1980:65; Dennis 1995d:86).
cotense – coarse woolen material (Dennis 1995d:86).
cotón – cotton cloth stamped with various colors (Dennis 1995d:86).
covalongas – a plant in the Lauraceae family used as a substitute for quinine (Almaráz 1980:50).

cuartilla – liquid measure of 4.03 liters (Marken 1994:243).
cuartillo – liquid measure of 0.5 liters (Marken 1994:243).
cubo – a wooden barrel. The RAE defines it as a round vessel of wood in which the mouth is smaller
that the belly and has two rings of iron (RAE 1729:673, 1).
cucharas – masonry trowels (Hindes 1998:41).
cueros de sol – parasols, umbrellas. The Inventory lists “2 cueros de sol de pieles de benado curtidas,
para el P. Pres. y P. Santiestevan, con hechuras” originally translated as “2 cured, sun dried
deerskins” (Dennis 1995a:74). But Mariah Wade (personal communication 2011) interprets
this phrase to mean umbrellas, more specifically, parosols. A reference in support of this
interpretation is found in Holden’s (1982) history of the Lambshead Ranch. In August 1854,
two Indians belonging to a small band of southern Comanches rode into camp. “The Indians
rode in bareheaded with skin umbrellas hoisted, which caused some merriment” (Holden
1982:7).
cuero de zibola – buffalo hides (Mariah Wade, personal communication 2011).
cueros para cavezear – word appears in the Inventory in the context of “17 cueros para cavezear.”
Dennis (1995:74) translated this as “17 skins to cavezear (??),” but Mariah Wade (personal
communication 2011) notes that cavazear in Portuguese means dozing or sleeping. This
suggests the meaning here is leather for beds. During the Spanish colonial period, beds were
more like cots, with leather attached to a frame. The word cavezear can also mean balancing
(ballast), which may suggest a hammock.
cuervo – crow (Foster 1995a:238).

necks of a couple during a marriage ceremony], of yellow metal wire, linked together.” Dennis
(1995a:86) translated dogal as a rope or cord used in the marriage ceremony, put around bride
and groom’s neck as a symbol of union. Mariah Wade (personal communication 2011) notes
that “rope” here does not mean rope, as in twisted fibers, but rather a length of metal chain

1817:419, 2).

Dado has many possible meanings, including a die, lead shot (small lead balls), iron that has
been glued or melted together in a square shape which is used to charge cannon or artillery in

Varieties of this species are common to areas in Florida and Central and South America.

Of particular interest is Thevetia nitida, which is reported from Tabasco and the Yucatan
(Standley 1924:1153). The oil from these seeds is poisonous and if taken internally causes
vomiting, breathing restrictions, and heart paralysis (Standley 1924:1153). Indian tribes
of Mexico used the Thevetia plant medicinally. Aztecs used the leaves or juice for deafness,
skin diseases, ulcers, and toothaches. Some tribes reportedly carried seeds in their pockets
to prevent hemorrhoids (Standley 1924:1153), and some tribes used them as rattlesnake
antivenom (Standley 1924:1152). Of interest with regard to Misson San Sabá and Spanish
colonial trade in Texas, Standley (1924:1152) reported that Indians in this area wore the seeds
around their ankles as rattles in certain dances.

(personal communication 2011) translates talon as a chisel for carpenters and those who work
in wood molding based on the RAE’s definition of escoplo (chisel). The chisel they use has a
head of wood that can be removed (el escooplo que usan los Entalladóres y Carpintéros tiene
una cabeza de madera fuerte postiza y el de los Cantéros es todo hierro) (RAE A 1372:569, 1).

taza – a small bowl with vertical sides sloping to a base, used as a drinking vessel (Marken 1994:244).
taza calderas – a cup; a vessel to drink from. The Inventory lists “2 dozenas de tazas calderas,” which
Dennis could not translate. Mariah Wade (personal communication 2011) notes that calderas
means iron, copper, or metal vessel or pot for cooking, broken down from taza, a vessel to
drink from (cup) or possibly a big bowl to get water. Wade also notes that the phrase tazas “de”
calderas would mean ladles with big pots, but the Inventory clearly does not read this way.

tercio – a local unit of measure frequently used in the borderlands. Usually it connoted a bale or bundle
of sugar or fruit, and sometimes it was used to inventory tobacco, although Mariah Wade
(personal communication 2011) notes that it was used for everything. In practical terms, a
tercio was one-third of a hundredweight bale or bundle (Almaráz 1980:25). Wade notes that it
can also mean half of a cargo load (se llama tambien la mitad de una carga, que se divide en
dos tercios quando vá en fordos) (RAE A 1739:253, 2).
ternos de cruzes – handles for large processional crosses (sleeves or tubes of metal or wood) for the arms

“Rodala” does note appear in the RAE dictionary, but
a rodela is a round disc (Real Academia Española
1726-1992:A 1737:630, 2). A hijuela is a cover made
from a piece of fabric that is placed over the chalice
during mass (Real Academia Española 1726-1992:U
1780:527, 2).

Wade notes that Conchas are bivalves (rather than
the English term for a conical shell called a conch).
Conchas were not necessarily made of shell and it
often refers to concave discs made of silver, although
alabaster or a fine ceramic were also common.
Cassimeres has not been translated and may be a
spelling error. The word that appears in the original
Spanish document is difficult to read.
Marco is a unit of weight specific to silver or gold, and
it is equal to half a pound (Real Academia Española
1726-1992:U 1780:607, 2).

Additional Research Notes by Mariah Wade
and Jennifer McWilliams and from Published

This phrase refers to multiple missions. The original
plans called for three mission at San Sabá but only
one was built (Weddle 1964:59).

This entry probably refers to a book written
by Benito Jerónimo Feijóo y Montenegro in
the early eighteenth century. A Benedictine
friar, he wrote essays on natural science,
education, law, medicine, philology,
and popular beliefs and superstitions
(Encyclopedia Americana 1920).

Rather than two three-pieced crosses, Wade
interprets this as two large cross that had
handles (listed below) and was packed in
three pieces (a vertical staff and two crossmembers).

Wade notes that altar cruets are almost always silver
or possibly gold and that, later in Spanish colonial
Texas, cruets were made of silver and glass.

Dogal - nuce; or rope around the neck, collar, or leash
for brutals; rope at your neck (as in- to be hanged).
As used here, rope may not mean a rope made out
of twisted fibers. (Real Academia Española 17261992:1732:327, 2 and U 1780:374, 2). McWilliams
thinks that the dogales may be the small metal chain
links recovered in excavations by TTU and PAI.
Ynga most commonly refers to “Inca.” Inca Stone most
commonly refers to jade (nephrite).

Hindes could not translate talon but notes that
the term was “used in reference to a chisel at
Mission San Juan in 1794” and suggests a
tolon may be some kind of a crowbar (Hindes
1998:43); Wade notes that talones have
something to do with a mason’s pick or rock
chisel.

Torno - lathe (Hindes 1998:43); In this case, it may
imply an anvil to turn, cut, or shape some material
(metal) on; a turning lathe. Wade confirms Hindes
translation, and notes that torno means that the
machine rotates (Real Academia Española 17261992:A 1739:304, 2).

Estribo de brida is translated as”stirrups connected to

Porrilla para adobar - a small hammer to repair
horseshoe nails. This hammer is smaller than those
blacksmiths used to shoe horses. Adobar relates
to the repairing of horse shoe nails (Real Academia
Española 1726-1992:A 1737:329,2 and U 1780:739,1).
The RAE dictionary adds that adobar also refers to the
treatment of skins or pelts (Real Academia Española
1726-1992:A 1726:89, 1) but Wade notes that in this
context it has to do with horse shoes.
Wade looked carefully at the handwriting and notes
that it says fuego - not apego. Fuegomeans to brand
with irons (branding animals using fire).

Wade notes that azetre (or azete) is the root word
for olive oil, not holy water as translated by Dennis.
Cazuela: Cazuela (cajuleas) – round clay vessel wider
than deeper (vaso de barro Redondo mas ancho
que hondo) (Real Academia Española 1726-1992:U
1780:210, 1);
Palangana - vessel of different shapes, but generally
tall and deep with a rim about four fingers wide. The
vessel has on both sides a half-moon shaped cut to
allow for the neck in order that the barber can wash
the beard of the client. The vessel also serves as a
basin for washing hands and for other purposes (vaso
ò vasija de diferentes hechuras, lo mas comun es ser
prolongada y profunda, con un borde de rededor de
quatro dedos de ancho, en el qual, à ambos os lados,
tiene una muesca ò cortadura en media luna en la
qual entra el pescuezo para bañar el Barbero la barba.
Sirve tambien para lavar las manos y otros usos)
(Real Academia Española 1726-1992:A 1738: 89, 1).
Borzetanas is a misspelling of porcelanas or
bozelana(porcelain) as seen in Atienza (1889:93)

Estañar - iron or copper ítems were coated in tin to
protect the metal from rusting (piezas hechas de hierro
ù cobre porque los preserva del herrin) and herrin
refers to iron rust (Real Academia Española 17261992:A 1732:628, 2). A cover (bath) of tin on copper
vessels makes the food cooked in them better tasting
(El estáño puesto como bano en los vasos de cobre
hace en ellos mas agradable sabor) (Real Academia
Española 1726-1992:A 1732:629, 1). Wade notes
that these entries do not mention food but it must be
that reference because the “vessels” cannot be better
tasting.

Wade interprets this as nails for something
that has been waxed, as in, waterproofed
or sealed. Finishing was composed of wax
and other ingredients; smoothing with lime
mixture; not wax.

Cazo - copper vessel shaped like a half-orange with a
rim that has a large iron handle to remove the vessel
from the fire. This may refer to a skillet-like vessel used
to cook eggs, fish and other things; In some places
the name is given to an iron or copper ladle used to
dip water from jars (vaso de cobre ù de azosar en
forma de media naranja en cujo borde suele tener
clavado un mango largo de hierro para sacarle de la
lumbre, y sirve para cocer huevos, pescado y otras
cosas; se lama en algúnas partes la cuchára de hierro
ò cobre, con que se saca el agua de las tinajas) (Real
Academia Española 1726-1992:A 1729, 247, 1)
In this context, Olla refers to a shape and does not
imply ceramic. An olla-shaped vessel could be made
of many different materials. Although ceramic ollas
were common, this appears to refer to metal ollas that
were being tinned.

Table B.1, continued

Alambre is probably a misspelling of arambre; Alambre
- the metal generally called copper and in ancient
times called arambre (es el metal que generalmente
se llama cobre, y antiguamente arambre) (Real
Academia Española 1726-1992:A 1726:156, 2).
Atole is made by placing some cooked corn in water,
squeeze the mixture and drain it (Real Academia
Española 1726-1992:A 1726:471,1). Wade surmises
that the metal mesh acts as a sieve. The mixture
would have been made in large quantities for the
Indians.
Original Spanish text says “de pita floxa” and floxa is a
weak, lower quality rope or twine (que esta mal atado,
pouco apertado ò pouco tirante) (Real Academia
Española 1726-1992:U 1817:419, 2).

Wade notes that, in this case, allum was
probably used for medicine, a salt that is an
astengent and disinfects.

Wade suggests that the containers were
probably not made of metal because metal
would react with the spices.

Additional Research Notes by Mariah Wade
and Jennifer McWilliams and from Published
Sources
Wade notes that the two piedras are very likely
sharpening or pumics stones for the barber. Navaja
could be a razor (Real Academia Española 17261992:A 1734:653, 1), but not necessarily a folding
razor. The RAE dictionary says that those the barber’s
use are longer and larger knives and not pointed
(this is a liberal translation). In this context, navajeros
probably refers to knives rather than razors.

The RAE dictionary defines obleera as a desk
container for oblea, which is the red, liquid wax used
to seal letters (Real Academia Española 1726-1992:A

Cordobon - leather from a goat (Real Academia

the word does not appear in the dictionary until 1925.

Wade notes that in this context “España” refers to a
style and does not imply that the necklaces came from
Spain.

Again, granizovery probably means “seed beads” (see
line 216).
The Mystical City of God refers to a book written in
the 17th century by the Franciscan nun, María de
Ágreda, who became famous as the Lady in Blue
who made out-of-body visits to Native Americans in
Texas (Madres Concepcionistas de Ágreda 2012; see
Chapter 2).
Grante - cheap type of ruby (Real Academia Española
1726-1992:A 1734:72, 2)

Rosaries made from seeds of the Tepijilote
palm; Tepejilote is also a plant species name.
Also possibly a localized type of stone.

Gilopetec is a town located one hour north of
Mexico City in the Otomí region.
McWilliams (2001:126) hypothesized that
granizo could refer to tiny glass beads or
lead shot. Wade notes that granizo could be
a misspelling of granillo, which means “small
grains” or “small seeds.” Graniyo / Granillo
- small seeds; Maso / Mazo - hammer or a
certain amount of merchandise such as a
bundle or a bunch (Real Academia Española
1726-1992:A 1734:521, 2).

Wade notes that cabalonge may be a slang word.
Breaking the word down, coba means chicken;
coin; and hammered copper, gold, or silver; Spelled
covalong, the only dictionary entry says it is a plant
whose seeds replace quinine (Real Academia
Española 1726-1992:U, 1925:350, 3). Shigo (2001)
notes that, in higher doses, quinine causes uterine
contractions in animals, and this action could lead to
abortion. This is further supported by a citation for a
plant called Redbay (Persea borbonia (L.) Spreng;
in the Lauraceae family) which is an “abortifacient.” It
refers to an infusion of leaves taken to abort a fetus up
to about four months old (Sturtevant 1954:320).

These “tin-plated large lanterns” were used
for administering rites (McWilliams 2001:126).
Almaráz (1980:68) noted that six tin lanterns
listed in the San Bernardo Mission inventory
were used to “administer the Viaticum; the
Eucharist or Holy Communion.”

The jinglebells may refer to “hawk bells” found on

jinglebells as trade items on this Spanish inventory,
as well as in documented French trading sites, brings
up some interesting questions relating to cultural
interactions.

as rattles. The phrase refers to a large hard seed

were covered loosely with metal to create a rattle.
They may also have had a medicinal use. Engastado

that hugs or secures what is inside (Real Academia

Table B.1, continued

Doctrines of P. Castaño are Jesuit doctrins or books
introduced by Pope Benedict XIII.

Moya (2011:126) lists a silla de brida in a 1679 listing
of military supplies. Finally, Weckmann and LopezMorillas (1992:383) note that the most common saddle
used by Spanish conquistadors in Mexico were the
silla de brida: a short arabic saddle with high sturrups
and a comfortable, broad seat.

Silla de brida- all the gear that goes in the horses
mouth, plus the saddle; a seat made of wood and
irom, leather/straw or other thick fabric, with a back.
Two pieces of wood serve as armrests (serve to rest
your arms over four four wood supports (legs) (Real
Academia Española 1726-1992:1739:114, 1).

This implies that the paintings were framed and
traveled in this large box.

Divina Pastora probably refers to a fabric painting,
hung from a pole like a banner, that appears near the
center of the Destruction painting (see Chapter 13).
Wade notes that this does not imply a framed painting,
but rather a painting that could probably be rolled up
and transported.
See note above.

Little towelettes, handcloths, well-finished
(lace-like finish) from Germany; Applies to a
certain type of fabric worked in the style of
Germany, where it had originated.

Wade notes that trastos means junk, stuff, furniture,

Labrada means wax, cooked and purified so that it can
be used in a church. Wade adds that this purification
creates candles that produce less smoke.

Bohemia - garnet (granate, rubi de Bohemia) (Real
Academia Española 1726-1992:1914:151, 2). Piedra
is a rock, therefore Piedra de Bohemia is a garnet.

where Fr. Terreros was from and it does not imply that
the caravan traveled through Pachuca.

Lector refers to a level of education within the Catholic
church, and Fr. Ximenez was later involved in the
establishment of Apache missions in Uvalde.

Wade notes that this does not mean that the caravan
traveled to the Rio Grande missions. Rather, it means
that De Ecça y Muzquiz was sent there instead.
De Ecça y Muzquiz had an involved history with
mission system in Texas. In 1753, he assisted with
the investigations of the murder of Fray Juan José
Ganzábalqv at Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria
Mission, where he later served as temporary
commander until the arrival of Pedro de Rábago y
Terán. In 1757, De Ecça y Muzquiz was assigned as
lieutenant of the garrison of San Luis de las Amarillas
Presidio (San Sabá) where he served as a courier and
escort.

Wade changed the translation from “candlesticks with
handles” to “candlestick holders.”
McWilliams suggests this may be one of the few
references to the Tlaxcaltecans who lived at the
mission. Mozo means servant, and Joachin was the
servant. Wade notes that this phrase very likely refers
to an Indian since there is no last name given. Thus,
Joachin may have been one of the Tlaxcaltecan
natives.

Table B.1, continued

Parasols does not mean sun dried skins, but “skins of
the sun.” This probably refers to parasols or umbrellas.
A reference to the history of Lambshead Ranch
mentions Comanche Indians carrying skin umbrellas
in 1854 “which caused much merriment” (Holden
1982:7) .

Padres of S. Fernando refers to the three friars from
the College of San Fernando.

Calderas - iron, copper or metal vessel, pot for
cooking. Taza- a vessel to drink from (cup), possibly
meaning a big bowl to get water. Wade notes that if
the phrase was tazas de calderas it would mean ladles
with big pots, but in this context taza refers to a vessel.

Wade notes that this was difficult to translate. Lavabos
is a table where people cleans themselves (Real
Academia Española 1726-1992:U 1869:458, 2). Dado
has numerous extremely varied meanings including 1.
dice, 2. shot (ammunition), 3. canvas patch for sails,
4. fate (roll of the dice), and 5. washstands and dais.
Wade interprets this to mean that they had the basins
but lacked wooden frames for the basins.

1:4

Wade notes that the context of the phrase implies that
the woolen sackcloths were used to clothe or dress
the Indians.
Wade’s interpretation of sillas de brida is a harness
plus the reins and saddle (see Sanz 2005).

Brother Sota Sindico, the master accountant, is
mentioned three times– is he in the records as
traveling with them?

This refers to something similar to the “cloth caps for
the Indians” listed above (see line 256).

Wade translates mantas y sobre enjalmas en los
aparejos as “blankets and overs for the harnesses.”
But what the “overs” for the harnesses means is
unclear.

The word ollas could refer to “bowls or pots,” but it
could also refer to some type of jug or large narrowmouth vessel.

Costaleria de tierra blanca - lime for tortillas; “At Saltillo
nine families of Tlaxcaltecan Indians were obtained
to be used as instructors for the neophytes” (Dunn
1914:391, Casteñeda 1936:394) and in Trinidad’s
“Revenve of the San Saba” (Dennis 1995b).

Castaño is a town near Monclova, southwest
of Laredo and northwest of Saltillo. Col.
Parrilla arrived in Monclova on Dec 1, then
at San Juan Bautista a “few days later”
(Casteñeda 1936:394).

This refers not to private cargo, but to trade goods
intended for the Apache. Wade notes that trade items
were a “carrot” to entice Apaches to come to the
mission.

Phil Dennis notes that 50,250 is incorrect and the total
here should be 5025 pesos.

Casteñeda states that 1,400 cattle and 700 sheep
were collected along with many “other supplies…in
San Antonio by March” (Casteñeda 1936:396).

The friars arrived in San Antonio on Dec 14, 1756
(Weddle 1964:43), and Col. Parrilla arrived on Dec 22,
1756 (Dunn 1914:391).

Wade speculates that the “11 1/2 loads” that were
sent back to San Antonio might refer to supplies from
Mission San Xavier.

It is unclear what “33 loads of equipment of the
Apaches taken from San Marcos to San Sabá” really
means. This probably refers to mule loads of supplies,
and Wade speculates that this could be supplies from
Mission San Xavier that were contested by the San
Sabá and San Antonio missions.

This seems to indicate that four Indian families joined
the group in San Marcos, but where they came from
is not clear.

Additional Research Notes by Mariah Wade
and Jennifer McWilliams and from Published
Sources
The is good example of the difficulty of using a
verbatim translation from an older dictionary. A Cubo
is a round vessel of wood with a mouth that is smaller
than the belly and it has two rings of iron (Real
Academia Española 1726-1992:1729:673,1). The
literal translation might be “containers of ironwork,”
but the simpler and more precise translation would be
“barrels of ironwork” of “wooden barrels.”

Appendix F: Neutron Activation Analysis of Ceramics
INTRODUCTION
This project involves the analysis of 34 ceramic samples, 2 burned daub samples, and 1
natural clay sample from three sites in Menard County, Texas. The samples are from Mission San
Sabá, Presidio San Sabá, and a Late Prehistoric (Toyah phase) site called the Fivemile Crossing
site (41MN55), and the 34 sherds include 17 Native-made plainwares and 17 Spanish colonial
wares. The latter are typed as Mexican-made redware or red-slipped ware (n = 2), majolica
(n = 9), olive jar (n = 5), and salt-glazed stoneware (n = 1). These 37 samples are interpreted
in the context of all available mission ceramics from the region, including datasets submitted
to MURR by Steve Tomka (GST001-032), Britt Bousman (KAT201-221, LGS301-320, RFT001147), and Mike Quigg (TRC262-269) and samples analyzed for Shawn Carlson by the Center
for Chemical Characterization and Analysis (now the Elemental Analysis Laboratory) at Texas
A&M University (SC121-170 and SC255-305).
A summary of these neutron activation analysis (NAA) samples is presented in Table
F.1, and Figure F.1 provides a map of all the sites included in this study. Hundreds of additional
Spanish colonial ceramic samples that relate to these data were analyzed for Shawn Carlson at
the Smithsonian Institution (Carlson et al. 2007), but these data are not available for comparison
or interpretation. The primary goals of this research are to examine the relationships between
and among the Native-made pottery and the imported Spanish colonial pottery within the
mission system of Texas.
The samples included in this study are diverse in both the types represented (including
Native-made and imported Spanish pottery) and the wide geographic spread. This diversity is
evident in that the NAA data allow for the identification of 21 chemically distinct compositional
groups. The ceramics have been divided into seven main type categories, and there are strong
correlations between types, sites, and compositional groups. but these chemical groups provide
some insights into the manufacture and transport of ceramic vessels within the missions and
presidios in Spain’s northern frontier.
SAMPLE PREPARATION
Pottery samples were prepared for NAA using procedures standard at MURR. Fragments
of about 1 cm2 were removed from each sample and abraded using a silicon carbide burr in
order to remove glaze, slip, paint, and adhering soil, thereby reducing the risk of measuring
contamination. The samples were washed in deionized water and allowed to dry in the laboratory.
Once dry, the individual sherds were ground into powders with an agate mortar and pestle
to homogenize the samples. Archival samples were retained from each sherd (when possible)
for future research. Clay and daub samples were fired and prepared using standard MURR
procedures.
Two analytical samples were prepared from each source specimen. Portions of
approximately 150 mg of powder were weighed into clean high-density polyethylene vials used
for short irradiations at MURR. At the same time, 200 mg of each sample was weighed into clean
high-purity quartz vials used for long irradiations. Individual sample weights were recorded
to the nearest 0.01 mg using an analytical balance. Both vials were sealed prior to irradiation.
Along with the unknown samples, standards made from National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST)-certified standard reference materials of SRM-1633a (coal fly ash) and
SRM-688 (basalt rock) were similarly prepared, as were quality control samples (e.g., standards

IRRADIATION AND GAMMA-RAY SPECTROSCOPY
Neutron activation analysis of ceramics at MURR, which consists of two irradiations
and a total of three gamma counts, constitutes a superset of the procedures used at most other
NAA laboratories (Glascock 1992; Neff 1992, 2000). As discussed in detail by Glascock (1992),
a short irradiation is carried out through the pneumatic tube irradiation system. Samples in
the polyvials are sequentially irradiated, two at a time, for five seconds by a neutron flux of

597

598

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
8x1013 n cm-2 s-1. A 720-second count yields gamma spectra containing peaks for nine shortlived elements: aluminum (Al), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), dysprosium (Dy), potassium (K),
manganese (Mn), sodium (Na), titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V). The samples encapsulated in
quartz vials are subjected to a 24–hour irradiation at a neutron flux of 5x1013 n cm-2 s-1. This long
irradiation is analogous to the single irradiation utilized at most other laboratories. After the long
irradiation, samples decay for seven days and then are counted for 1,800 seconds (the “middle
count”) on a high-resolution germanium detector coupled to an automatic sample changer. The
middle count yields determinations of seven medium half-life elements, namely arsenic (As),
lanthanum (La), lutetium (Lu), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), uranium (U), and ytterbium
(Yb). After an additional three- or four-week decay, a final count of 8,500 seconds is carried out
on each sample. The latter measurement yields the following 17 long half-life elements: cerium
(Ce), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), cesium (Cs), europium (Eu), iron (Fe), hafnium (Hf), nickel
(Ni), rubidium (Rb), antimony (Sb), scandium (Sc), strontium (Sr), tantalum (Ta), terbium (Tb),
thorium (Th), zinc (Zn), and zirconium (Zr).
INTERPRETING CHEMICAL DATA
The analyses at MURR produce concentration values for 33 elements in most samples. The
analysis of the Carlson samples at Texas A&M followed similar procedures and used the same
standards as MURR, and thus no transformation of the data was necessary to make it compatible
with the MURR data. All data were combined into a single file for interpretation. Data for Ni in
many samples was below detection limits (as is the norm for most New World ceramic analyses),
and the element was removed from consideration during the statistical analysis. Potassium and
strontium were also missing for numerous samples, and these elements were also removed from
the data set. Arsenic, antimony, titanium, and cobalt were also eliminated due to a number of
reasons, including high analytical error, missing values, and potential for contamination.
All further statistical analysis was carried out on base-10 logarithms of concentrations
on the remaining 26 elements. Use of log concentrations rather than raw data compensates for
differences in magnitude between the major elements, such as iron, and trace elements, such
as the rare earth or lanthanide elements (REEs). Transformation to base-10 logarithms also
yields a more-normal distribution for many trace elements.
The interpretation of compositional data obtained from the analysis of archaeological
materials is discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., Baxter and Buck 2000; Bieber et al. 1976; Bishop
and Neff 1989; Glascock 1992; Harbottle 1976; Neff 2000) and is only be summarized here. The
main goal of data analysis is to identify distinct homogeneous groups within the analytical
database. Based on the provenance postulate of Weigand et al. (1977), different chemical groups
may be assumed to represent geographically restricted sources. For lithic materials such as
obsidian, basalt, and cryptocrystalline silicates (e.g., chert, flint, or jasper), raw material samples
are frequently collected from known outcrops or secondary deposits, and the compositional data
obtained on the samples are used to define the source localities or boundaries. The locations
of sources can also be inferred by comparing unknown specimens (i.e., ceramic artifacts) to
knowns (i.e., clay samples) or by indirect methods such as the “criterion of abundance” (Bishop
et al. 1992) or by arguments based on geological and sedimentological characteristics (e.g.,
Steponaitis et al. 1996). The ubiquity of ceramic raw materials usually makes it impossible to
sample all potential sources intensively enough to create groups of knowns to which unknowns

Appendix F: Neutron Activation Analysis of Ceramics
can be compared. Lithic sources tend to be more localized and compositionally homogeneous in
the case of obsidian or compositionally heterogeneous as in the case for most cherts.
Compositional groups can be viewed as “centers of mass” in the compositional hyperspace
described by the measured elemental data. Groups are characterized by the locations of their
centroids and the unique relationships (i.e., correlations) between the elements. Decisions about
whether to assign a specimen to a particular compositional group are based on the overall
probability that the measured concentrations for the specimen could have been obtained from
that group.
Initial hypotheses about source-related subgroups in the compositional data can be
derived from noncompositional information (e.g., archeological context, decorative attributes,
etc.) or from application of various pattern-recognition techniques to the multivariate chemical
data. Some of the pattern-recognition techniques that have been used are cluster analysis (CA),
principal component analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA). Each has advantages and
disadvantages that may depend upon the types and quantity of data available for interpretation.
The variables (measured elements) in archeological and geological data sets are often
correlated and frequently large in number. This makes handling and interpreting patterns
difficult. Therefore, it is often useful to transform the original variables into a smaller set of
uncorrelated variables to make data interpretation easier. Of the above-mentioned patternrecognition techniques, PCA transforms the data from the original correlated variables into
uncorrelated variables most easily.
PCA creates a new set of reference axes arranged in decreasing order of variance
subsumed. The individual PCs are linear combinations of the original variables. The data can
be displayed on combinations of the new axes, just as they can be displayed on the original
elemental concentration axes. PCA can be used in a pure pattern-recognition mode, i.e., to
search for subgroups in an undifferentiated data set, or in a more-evaluative mode, i.e., to
assess the coherence of hypothetical groups suggested by other criteria. Generally, compositional
differences between specimens can be expected to be larger for specimens in different groups
than for specimens in the same group, and this implies that groups should be detectable as
distinct areas of high point density on plots of the first few components.
It is well known that PCA of chemical data is scale dependent, and analyses tend to
be dominated by those elements or isotopes for which the concentrations are relatively large.
As a result, standardization methods are common to most statistical packages. A common
approach is to transform the data into logarithms (e.g., base-10).
One frequently exploited strength of PCA, discussed by Baxter (1992), Baxter and Buck (2000),
and Neff (1994, 2002), is that it can be applied as a simultaneous R- and Q-mode technique, with
both variables (elements) and objects (individual analyzed samples) displayed on the same set
of principal component reference axes. A plot using the first two principal components as axes is
usually the best possible two-dimensional representation of the correlation or variance-covariance
structure within the data set. Small angles between the vectors from the origin to variable
coordinates indicate strong positive correlation; angles at 90º indicate no correlation; and angles
close to 180º indicate strong negative correlation. Likewise, a plot of sample coordinates on these
same axes will be the best two-dimensional representation of Euclidean relations among the
samples in log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on the variance-covariance matrix) or

599

600

standardized log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on the correlation matrix). Displaying
both objects and variables on the same plot makes it possible to observe the contributions of
specific elements to group separation and to the distinctive shapes of the various groups. Such
a plot is commonly referred to as a biplot in reference to the simultaneous plotting of objects
and variables. The variable inter-relationships inferred from a biplot can be verified directly
by inspecting bivariate elemental concentration plots (note that a bivariate plot of elemental
concentrations is not a biplot).
Whether a group can be discriminated easily from other groups can be evaluated visually
in two dimensions or statistically in multiple dimensions. A metric known as the Mahalanobis
distance (or generalized distance) makes it possible to describe the separation between groups
or between individual samples and groups on multiple dimensions. The Mahalanobis distance
of a specimen from a group centroid (Bieber et al. 1976; Bishop and Neff 1989) is defined by:

Dy2, X =
[ y − X ]t I x [ y − X ]
where y is the 1-x-m array of logged elemental concentrations for the specimen of
interest, X is the n-x-m data matrix of logged concentrations for the group to which the point is
being compared with X being its 1-x-m centroid, and I x is the inverse of the m-x-m variancecovariance matrix of group X. Because Mahalanobis distance takes into account variances and
covariances in the multivariate group, it is analogous to expressing distance from a univariate
mean in standard deviation units. Like standard deviation units, Mahalanobis distances can be
converted into probabilities of group membership for individual specimens. For relatively small
sample sizes, it is appropriate to base probabilities on Hotelling’s T 2 , which is the multivariate
extension of the univariate Student’s t .
When group sizes are small, Mahalanobis distance-based probabilities can fluctuate
dramatically depending upon whether each specimen is assumed to be a member of the group to
which it is being compared. Harbottle (1976) calls this phenomenon “stretchability” in reference
to the tendency of an included specimen to stretch the group in the direction of its own location
in elemental concentration space. This problem can be circumvented by cross-validation, that
is, by removing each specimen from its presumed group before calculating its own probability
of membership (Baxter 1994; Leese and Main 1994). This is a conservative approach to group
evaluation that may sometimes exclude true group members.
Small sample and group sizes place further constraints on the use of Mahalanobis
distance: with more elements than samples, the group variance-covariance matrix is singular
2
thus rendering calculation of I x (and D itself) impossible. Therefore, the dimensionality
of the groups must somehow be reduced. One approach would be to eliminate elements
considered irrelevant or redundant. The problem with this approach is that the investigator’s
preconceptions about which elements should discriminate may not be valid. It also squanders
the main advantage of multielement analysis, namely the capability to measure a large number
of elements. An alternative approach is to calculate Mahalanobis distances with the scores
on principal components extracted from the variance-covariance or correlation matrix for the
complete data set. This approach entails only the assumption, entirely reasonable in light of
the above discussion of PCA, that most group-separating differences should be visible on the
first several PCs. Unless a data set is extremely complex, containing numerous distinct groups,
using enough components to subsume at least 90 percet of the total variance in the data can be

Appendix F: Neutron Activation Analysis of Ceramics
generally assumed to yield Mahalanobis distances that approximate Mahalanobis distances in
full elemental concentration space.
Lastly, Mahalanobis distance calculations are also quite useful for handling missing data
(Sayre 1975). When many specimens are analyzed for a large number of elements, it is almost
certain that a few element concentrations will be missed for some of the specimens. This occurs
most frequently when the concentration for an element is near the detection limit. Rather than
eliminate the specimen or the element from consideration, it is possible to substitute a missing
value by replacing it with a value that minimizes the Mahalanobis distance for the specimen
from the group centroid. Thus, those few specimens that are missing a single concentration
value can still be used in group calculations.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The ceramic samples are assigned to 21 chemically distinct groups, with 76 (22.7 percent)
remaining unassigned. As summarized in Table F.2, the groups fall into three broad categories
by the number of assigned samples. The 7 small groups have only 2–3 samples assigned. The 9
medium-sized groups have 5–11 members. The 5 large groups have between 24 and 45 members
each. The following sections describe the compositional variability of the samples, a comparison
to other potentially relevant ceramic and raw material samples, and an assessment of ceramic
production and exchange among the Texas missions. A complete list of the samples included in
this study, along with the compositional group assignments and basic sample type descriptive
information, is presented in Table F.3.
Small Groups
The seven small groups all have between two and four samples. These groups are all small
clusters of samples that separate from other samples in at least one plot and that consistently
plot together (Figure F.2).
Group 9
Group 9 consists of two Native-made ceramic samples from Mission San Lorenzo (41RE1).
The samples are most distinctive in their high thorium concentrations. They comprise two out
of the seven Native-made samples from this site, and given the great distance between this
site and other sites included in this study, these two samples may represent a common local
composition that is only barely sampled.
Group 10
Group 10 consists of two samples with elevated cesium concentrations. Both samples
are Mexican-made lead-glazed earthenware from Mission Rosario (41GD2). The majority of
this type of pottery belongs to Groups 1, 2, and 4, but given the long-distance import of these
ceramics, small isolated compositions are reasonable.
Group 11
The two burned daub samples from Mission San Sabá (41MN23) comprise the entirety
of Group 11. While matches between local daub and ceramics can be an indication of locally

produced ceramics, the same raw materials or recipes were not necessarily used for ceramics

Group 12
Group 12 includes two olive jar samples from Mission San Sabá (41MN23) and one
Mexican-made lead-glazed earthenware sherd from Mission Dolores (41SA25). The three
samples exhibit elevated concentrations of chromium. The two different ceramic types could
easily represent functionally different vessel forms made at the same location. The recovery
of these three samples at sites more than 500 km apart may reflect the integrated ceramic
procurement networks of the missions.
Group 13
Group 13 consists of 2 Native-made plainwares from Presidio Santa Cruz with elevated
concentrations of sodium. The 19 other plainware samples from this site mostly fit into the main
groups for the Native-made plainwares for all the sites in the study.

Group 14
Group 14 includes two Mexican-made lead-glazed earthenware samples from Mission
Refugio (41RF1). They haveelevated tantalum concentrations.
Group 15
Group 15 includes four Native-made plainware samples from the Toyah phase Fivemile
Crossing site (41MN55).80 The samples are most distinctive in their high cesium concentrations.
There is only one other plainware sample from this site, and it is unassigned, suggesting this
group may represent the general signature for locally made plainwares. The single natural clay
sample submitted from this site is also unassigned.

The Toyah phase dates from ca. a.d. 1300 to 1700, but the age of the Toyah component at 41MN55 is not well
documented (Boyd and Mehalchick 2017).

Medium Groups
Nine of the compositional groups identified in this study have between 5 and 11 members.
These groups show separation from other samples, yet do not contain enough samples to allow
robust statistical validation. Five of the groups include only Native-made plainware samples,
two groups include only a single type of imported glazed ware, and one group includes a mixture
of types from the same site. The groups are individually discussed in order of the dominant type
rather than the sequential group number. Eight of the groups are plotted in Figure F.3, and the
remaining medium group (Group 1b) is plotted relative to Group 1 in Figure F.4.
Group 3
Group 3 includes nine Native-made ceramics: four from Mission Espada (41BX4) and
five from Mission San Juan (41BX5). The two sites are within 2 km of each other. This group
may represent a localized composition as there are no other sites with members of this group.
Group 5
Group 5 consists of eight samples of Native-made plainware from Rancho de las Cabras
(41WN30). The localized nature of this group suggests local production, use, and discard.
Group 7
Group 7 includes 11 Native-made plainware samples from Mission Espada (41BX4) and
Rancho de las Cabras (41WN30). The two sites are 40 km apart, and Rancho de las Cabras was
the livestock ranch that served Mission Espada. Although the current data do not support any
definitive identification of the production location, it is possible that the pottery was made by
the Native peoples at either the mission or the rancho.
Group 18
Group 18 includes 10 Native-made plainwares from Presidio Santa Cruz (41KA26-B) and
one from Mission Refugio (41RF1). This group accounts for almost half of the 21 samples from
Presidio Santa Cruz, and its limited spatial distribution suggests production at or near this site.
Group 19
Group 19 consists of six samples of Native-made plainware from Mission San Sabá
(41MN23). The group is most notable for low concentrations of vanadium. The only remaining
plainware sample from the site remains unassigned. It is interesting to note the lack of
compositional overlap between the plainware samples from Mission San Sabá and those from
nearby Presidio San Sabá (41MN1) and the Fivemile Crossing site (41MN55).
Group 6
All nine of the majolica (tin-glazed earthenware) samples in this study are from a single
site, Mission San Sabá (41MN23), and they comprise the entirety of Group 6 (Samples PAI-107
to PAI-112). This likely indicates the import of these ceramics from a single production location,
but lack of comparable ceramics from other mission sites makes this difficult to assess.

NAA groups. The ellipses represent 90 percent confidence intervals for membership in the groups.

Group 8
Group 8 is similar to the small Group 12 in that they both contain olive jars and Mexicanmade lead-glazed earthenwares, suggesting the overlap between the ceramic types. The five
samples in Group 8 are also from the same two widely separated sites as in Group 12. It appears
that the two sites (41MN23 and 41SA25) utilized a shared, or at least similar, import system.
Group 20
Group 20 remains one of the more puzzling groups in this study. It includes five members,
all from Mission San Lorenzo (41RE1), but there are both imported Mexican-made ceramics and
Native-made plainwares. The simplest explanation is misclassification of some of the samples,
but this seems unlikely given the visible differences between imported and Native ceramics.
Another possibility is that Group 20 represents two different ceramic types that happen to
overlap in all (or almost all) elemental concentrations. A careful examination of the patterns
within the group reveals a split between the Native-made plainwares and the imported ceramics,

with only a slight difference in zirconium concentrations. A hierarchical cluster analysis of this
group also shows some separation between the two types of ceramics.
Large Groups
The identification and testing of the larger groups is a more-complicated process, but
it results in more statistically justifiable groups. There are five groups with 24 to 45 members.
Two of the groups (16 and 17) include only Native-made plainwares, and two groups (1 and 2)
contain only imported ceramics. The final large group (4) includes a mix of imported and Nativemade plainwares. The medium-sized Group 1b is discussed along with Group 1. Figure F.5 is a
plot of all five large groups, and Table F.4 lists the membership probabilities for the members
of the large groups as well as projected probabilities for all other samples in the study.
Group 16
Group 16 is one of the two dominant signatures for the Native-made plainwares from
Mission Refugio (41RF1). All but one member of Group 16 is from this site, and it comprises

Appendix F: Neutron Activation Analysis of Ceramics
15 percent of the plainware sample from this site. The single sample from Presidio San Sabá
(41MN1) may represent a rare case of long-distance transport of the plainware (compared with
more common long-distance transport of other wares). This group is most distinct in a plot of
hafnium and thorium.
Group 17
Group 17 is the largest compositional group in the study and is comprised entirely
of Native-made plainwares. Forty of the 45 members of the group are from Mission Refugio
(41RF1). The remaining 5 samples are from the two closest sites (41GD2 and 41KA26-B). This
group likely represents a local production signature at or near 41RF1 and limited exchange
in the region. Groups 17 and 18 are very similar in composition. It would be reasonable to
consider Group 18 as a subgroup of Group 17. The major difference is in spatial distribution.
The majority of Group 17 is from 41RF1 with only a few samples from 41KA26-B, while Group
18 has the inverse distribution.
Groups 1 and 1b
The 48 members of Groups 1 and 1b account for more than half of the Mexican-made
lead-glazed earthenware samples in the study. Group 1b includes 5 samples separated from
Group 1 in Figure F.4. Group 1 includes samples from the southern missions in this study. One
of the samples in Group 1 is classified as a Mexican redware, and its inclusion in the group is
questionable. It has 0 percent probability of membership in the group (see Table F.4) although
the same calculations made using different numbers of principal components have slightly higher
probabilities of membership. All Group 1b samples are from Mission Refugio (41RF1). Whether
this represents a statistical coincidence, a slight manufacturing variant that predominantly
reached Mission Refugio, or localized different diagenesis is not apparent.
Group 2
Group 2 includes 27 members, including 12 Mexican-made lead-glazed earthenwares
and 15 Mexican redwares. The inclusion of both ceramic types suggests that they were likely
manufactured at the same locations, using the same paste. This group is predominantly in the
more-southern sites, but there are samples from 41MN23 and 41SA25. Although separated from
Group 1 according to Mahalanobis distance calculations (see Table F.4), Groups 1 and 2 are at
least slightly overlapping in almost all elemental plots.
Group 4
Group 4 includes 24 members. Nine are Native-made plainwares, and 15 are Mexicanmade lead-glazed earthenwares, posing some of the same issues as Group 20. There is a slight
suggestion of separation between the two types within the group, but it is even more subtle
than in Group 20. The samples are all from the southern mission sites.
Unassigned Samples
The 74 unassigned pottery samples (the 2 clay samples are also unassigned and described
in the next section) represent only 23 percent of the total sample and include every type with
at least 10 samples and every site. The unassigned samples are divided into two groups. The 16

samples that clearly separate from the scatter of the entire data set are classified as outliers.
They most likely represent samples of unusual ceramics or long-distance imports. For example,
two of the three Caddo engraved sherds are classified as outliers.
The remaining 60 unassigned samples fall in the general pattern of the assigned
samples, but do not clearly belong to one of the established compositional groups or do not
cluster sufficiently to justify the development of another group.
Comparison of Burned Daub and Raw Clay Samples
The two burned daub samples were submitted in the hope of characterizing the local
clays used to construct buildings (jacals) at Mission San Sabá (41MN23). Both samples are
assigned to Group 11 (as described above), and these do not match the ceramic samples from
Mission San Sabá or any other site, nor do they match the natural clay sample from nearby
41MN55, which represents an alluvial clay from the Holocene terrace on the San Saba River.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------All four of the raw clay samples (sample PAI-135 from 41MN55, sample RFT147 from
41RF1, sample GST031 from Bexar County, and sample GST032 from Wilson County) are
unassigned. Based on group membership probabilities, they are clearly not members of any
of the large groups (see Table F.4), and they do not consistently plot with any of the small or
medium-sized groups. It is common for raw clay samples to remain unassigned because most
ceramics are made from paste that has had various other materials removed or added.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We acknowledge Tim Ferguson for his role in preparing the samples for irradiation.
The Texas Department of Transportation provided the funds for the analysis of the 37 samples
submitted by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. Some of the previously analyzed samples included in
the comparative study were supported by grants to MURR from the National Science Foundation.
We also thank Shawn Carlson for providing the NAA data for the samples analyzed at Texas
A&M University.

Appendix G: Petrographic Analysis of Ceramic Sherds from Three Sites
INTRODUCTION
A petrographic analysis of 17 small earthenware sherds was accomplished between June
and October, 2010, for Prewitt and Associates, Inc, under Texas Department of Transportation
Work Authorization No. 57901SA002 and performed under authority of Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 4317. The pottery was recovered from three sites in Menard County, west-central
Texas: 41MN1, Presidio San Sabá, 5 sherds; 41MN23, Mission San Sabá, 7 sherds; and 41MN55,
Fivemile Crossing site, 5 sherds. The sites all lie within a few miles of each other in the San
Saba River valley, a tributary to the Colorado River.
The petrographic analysis was conducted to compare bone-tempered ceramics from the
three sites and gain insights on the technology of Late Prehistoric and Historic period bonetempered pottery. Because the sherds from the mission and presidio are visually different from
what are presumed to be Late Prehistoric sherds from 41MN55 (e.g., sherd color, thickness, finish,
etc.), it was expected that there would be differences in the petrography of the samples as well.
Recognizing and documenting these differences was a primary goal of this study. Examination
of all the components of the ceramic fabrics—bone, minerals, and clay matrix—can also address
issues of affinity, origins of pottery, and movement of ceramics by trade or other means. An
especially important research topic is the examination of the effect of European contact on
aboriginal ceramic technology, whether suppressive or transforming through the adoption of
new techniques and procedures.
The samples in this study are numbered PAI-101 through PAI-117, and they were taken
from larger sherds, a portion of which was also extracted for sourcing study using neutron
activation analysis (NAA). All of the sherds in this petrographic analysis have corresponding
NAA data (see Appendix F). Comparing the different results of these two methods could provide
further insights on the origins, technologies, and cultural connections of these bone-tempered
wares.
Because all of the ceramics were identified as bone-tempered plainwares,81 this study
focused on the bone tempering materials by breaking down the bones observed in the thin
sections and creating multiple bone variables. For each bone particle, the Wentworth particle
size classification is used to define the particle type, angularity, and size.
METHODOLOGY
Petrographic Thin Section Analysis
The principal method of the analysis was identification and point counting of minerals
and ceramic structures following the method of Chayes (1949) and the approach to petrographic
analysis pioneered in archeology by Shepard (1942, 1954). The National Petrographic Service,
Inc., in Houston prepared the thin sections. The microscopic analysis and point counts were
performed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory’s microscopy lab using an Olympus
stereographic microscope.
Point counting is a standard procedure that offers replicable results. It amounts to
counting a set number (at least 200 in this case) of ceramic attributes observed in the viewing
field during systematic microscopic traverses of each thin section. Counting the same number
of ceramic attributes in each thin section allows reliable statistical comparisons. Counted
81

attributes included the ceramic fabric “matrix,” pore space, and discrete inclusions such as
crushed minerals and bone. Additional information such as grain size and shape, particularly
on the bone particles, was recorded on the counting sheet for potential future reference. The
color and isotropy of the ceramic matrix was determined and recorded. Any mineral specimen
that was observed in the viewing field but did not fall into the count was recorded as “tr” for
trace, so as not to lose information on rare but potentially significant bodies.
The primary means of analysis was to define paste groups among the studied sections
from the observed and counted ceramic features. Paste groups may or may not relate to similar
groupings identified on a typological basis. Once defined, however, they allow wider comparisons
with paste groups defined on a petrographic basis. The bone variables were examined further
and separately as a group to gain comparative observations on bone tempering technology
employed at the sites.
Mineralogy
The mineral components of the ceramic fabrics comprise a small suite of 12 minerals
and rocks that are fairly common across the collection, varying in presence and proportions. The
identified species are: fresh quartz, composite quartz, chert, hematite, clay bodies, muscovite,
biotite, plagioclase feldspar, sanidine feldspar, limestone, and calcite. These species of minerals
may all be found on the Edwards Plateau of west-central Texas.
Fresh quartz, composite quartz, and chert are forms of quartz with differing chemical
origins. These quartz forms and their terminology here are adapted from classifications put
forth by Folk (1980:65–71). Fresh quartz as identified in the thin sections is the typical free
grain of the material with conventional optical properties. An important distinction is that
none of the identified fresh quartz shows consistent roundness and uniform grain sizes as
would be expected of stream-rolled quartz sand or beach sand. Most of the fresh quartz in the
collection is in size ranges from coarse silt to medium sand and has angular, subangular and
subrounded shapes. The composite quartz shows distinct, sometimes jagged boundaries and
faceted extinction typical of quartz grains in rocks. In ceramic thin sections, the parent rock
of composite quartz grains is usually present as well, but this is not the case in the San Sabá
collection. Chert is quartz crystallized from silica-rich aqueous solution, which gives the rock
distinctive physical and optical properties. The Edwards Plateau offers numerous terrigenous
environments of formation of chert, and the Colorado River transports vast quantities of chert
gravels and cobbles from the High Plains.
Hematite is the mineral form of iron oxide and is ubiquitous in rock formations over
much of Texas. All of the hematite in the collection has the reddish appearance indicative of
ferrous hematite, of valence 2+. The particles appear consistently well-rounded in sizes from
coarse silt to medium sand.
Clay bodies are a problematic species found only in thin section PAI-106. They are
distinctly bounded bodies with contents looking like the ceramic matrix outside them and
containing similar mineral particles, predominantly quartz. They may be unfired clay crumbs
thrown into the prepared clay matrix to serve as additional tempering and to give texture. But
they are clearly not sherd tempering, or grog.

Appendix G: Petrographic Analysis of Ceramic Sherds from Three Sites
Muscovite and biotite are common micas. They usually form as alteration products of
igneous rocks and are typical residents of residual and alluvial clays.
Plagioclase and sanidine feldspars are common igneous minerals, formed in many kinds
of igneous rocks and other environments as well. The feldspars lack an obvious parent source
within the collection, and they must be considered detrital residents of the source clays.
Limestone and calcite are the carbonate members of the San Sabá collection. Various
forms and formations of limestone comprise the foundation rocks of the Edwards Plateau, most
of Cretaceous age. The limestone in the collection is strongly calcitic and is the obvious parent
rock of the calcite crystals recorded in the ceramic matrix.
The Bone Variables
In order to look at the patterning of bone tempering in the ceramics of the varying
locales of this study, it was necessary to examine the bone particles in fine detail. It was decided
initially to record bone variables by their combinations of size class and shape, each combination
becoming its own recorded variable. During the preparation phase of the study, bone type (fresh,
weathered, cancellous) was added to the observational matrix of meaningful dimensions. This
meant that bone variables could vary in number by the combinations of the three dimensions of
type, size and shape. At the end of the microscopic analysis, 59 combination bone variables had
been observed and counted in the thin sections. Table G.1 gives the particular combinations of
the dimensions and their variable codes. Each combination variable has at least one observation
in the study collection.
Bone type. Three types of bone were defined and observed in the collection: fresh,
weathered, and cancellous. Fresh bone may be recently defleshed, without any appearance
of sun-bleaching or weathering. Aside from its reduction in size and shape, fresh bone looks
in thin section like a well-formed particle, distinguished from other particles or minerals by
Haversian canals, the vascular system of the bone. Weathered bone may have, in hand specimen
and microscope thin section, series of fracture lines across the material, or it may have splits,
breakouts, and tears in the bone fabric. Cancellous bone is found in the interiors of bone, especially
the heads of long bones, with the marrow. The material presents a sponge-like appearance,
and while it is a hard bone material, it fractures easily. In thin section, cancellous bone looks
like broken tree branches; it is commonly in very coarse sand and granule sizes. Rogers and
Heffington (1985:90) note that cancellous bone makes excellent temper easily prepared after a
long bone is cracked open, a common practice for marrow acquisition. In contrast to the difficulties
of crushing hard fresh bone, the use of cancellous bone in ceramics may indicate an expedient
manufacturing technique. As weathered bone is also more easily reduced to workable particle
size, it may also have expedient value.
Bone size. The particle sizes of the bone elements identified in the thin sections were
recorded in terms of the Wentworth particle size scale, commonly used by soil scientists,
geologists, and engineers. The classes are delimited in metric units and labeled in terms of
natural particles—clay, silt, sand, granule, pebble, and larger sizes. In practical consideration,
clay particle sizes could not be observed at any instrumental magnification useful in this overall
study. At the other end of the scale, any particle larger than a granule would so interrupt the
ceramic fabric as to cause failure during firing; ancient potters would likely have removed large

particles. Therefor, the particle size classes recorded here proceed in size progression from small
to large: silt, sand, and granule, with their internal subdivisions (fine, coarse, etc).
Bone shape. Particle shapes inform greatly on processing and the origin of materials
entering a ceramic fabric. Various nominal scales exist for identifying shapes in microscopy
(Powers 1953). Shapes in the collection were identified by comparison of a particle to charts
illustrating several examples of each shape category. The category names used are: very angular,
angular, subangular, subrounded, rounded, and very rounded.
PASTE GROUPS, OBSERVATIONS, AND IMPLICATIONS
Beside the bone tempering variations in the ceramic pastes, the rocks, minerals, matrix
color, and matrix isotropy vary sufficiently to allow the identification of paste groups. Paste
groups imply the regular acquisition of materials and the manufacture of a particular ware of
pottery. They are valuable tools for comparisons with other wares and technologies. Four paste
groups were identified in this study (Table G.2). The detailed petrographic point count data (in
percentages) for all 17 samples are presented in Table G.3.

Appendix G: Petrographic Analysis of Ceramic Sherds from Three Sites
Paste Group 1:
PAI-101, PAI-102, PAI-103, PAI-104, and PAI-105
These are all the studied sherds from Presidio San Sabá, 41MN1. All have plentiful
bone temper poorly size sorted and ranging from coarse silt to granule, with the median size
category being medium sand. The paste colors range from light and reddish brown to reddish
and golden brown under cross nichols. Isotropy is mixed, three specimens being isotropic, and
two being anisotropic. The pastes are consistently moderately dense with numerous jagged,
striplike voids and gaps around the larger solid particles. The strongest mineral and rock
fingerprints are by fresh quartz, hematite, muscovite, and limestone. Although the limestone
is calcitic and well represented, the Group 1 thin sections lack any of its companion calcite as
is present in Paste Group 3.

Paste Group 2:
PAI-106
This is the single-most-distinctive thin section and paste group. The specimen comes
from Mission San Sabá, 41MN23, and is entirely lacking in any bone particles. The tempering
agent is fresh quartz in copious amounts and clay bodies. PAI-106 is the only specimen in the
study collection with these clay bodies. Chert and limestone are additional well-represented
minerals; and composite quartz, hematite, plagioclase, and sanidine are found in small amounts.
The matrix is isotropic and black under plain-polarized and cross-polarized light. The paste is
very dense, but with numerous jagged voids in strips. It is tempting to declare, simply on the
basis of distinctiveness, that this is a nonlocal sherd. The clay resident minerals, however, are
common elsewhere in the study collection. It may be more prudently logical to say that there
was a different ceramic technology used for the mission ceramics, one that refrained from bone
tempering and added clay bodies instead, and this may have operated contemporaneously with
the bone-tempering technology. It is intriguing to conjecture that this paste group may be a
remnant of a technology practiced by a different sociocultural group resident at the mission, a
group immigrated from a more-distant region. Inferences based on one specimen must remain
inconclusive, however.

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá
Paste Group 3:
PAI-107, PAI-108, PAI-109, PAI-110, PAI-111, and PAI-112
The six members of this group all come from Mission San Sabá, 41MN23. Matrix colors
range from light to very dark browns in plain polarized light to golden brown and black in crosspolarized light (cross nichols). All the pastes are isotropic. They are moderately dense with a few
jagged, striplike voids. Bone tempering is similar to Paste Group 1, poorly size-sorted bone in
all shapes and types, ranging in size from coarse silt to granule, with the median size category
being medium sand. The key minerals are copious fresh quartz and limestone. The limestone
is accompanied by significant amounts of crystalline calcite, save for one specimen, PAI-111.
Hematite is represented in all the thin sections, and sanidine feldspar was found in small
amounts in four. Lacking are composite quartz, clay bodies, muscovite, biotite, and plagioclase
feldspar.
Paste Group 4:
PAI-113, PAI-114, PAI-115, PAI-116, and PAI-117
This group is defined on all the thin sections from the Fivemile Crossing site (41MN55),
a Late Prehistoric Toyah phase campsite of uncertain age. Paste colors range from medium
yellowish brown to medium brown to dark reddish brown under plain polarized light to dark
brown, golden brown, and black under cross-polarized light. The pastes are uniformly anisotropic.
They are moderately dense with voids in jagged strips. The bone tempering is copious and
comprised of a relatively well-sorted assemblage of particles ranging in size from coarse silt to
coarse sand. The median size category is fine sand. The particles fall into a wide range of shapes.
By comparison with the other bone-tempered paste groups, Paste Group 4 has more-abundant
bone tempering in a more restricted, well-sorted size range. The mineral contributors to the
matrix are moderate proportions of fresh quartz, hematite, and limestone. Trace amounts of
chert and muscovite were noted. Paste Group 4 lacks composite quartz, clay bodies, biotite,
plagioclase feldspar, sanidine feldspar, and calcite.
GEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS
Observation 1
At the most general level, the entire assemblage has a relatively restricted suite of
mineral, rock, and bone contributors to the clays, and these species are all abundantly available
on the Edwards Plateau and in the San Saba River drainage. The fluctuations in the materials
show variant patterns sufficient to define valid paste groups. Even with the distinctiveness of
Paste Group 2, however, importation or long-distance transport could not be concluded. The
collection offers a picture of localized earthenware ceramic production.
Observation 2
The mission and presidio bone-tempered ceramics have poorly sorted bone particle sizes
falling into a wide range of size categories. This trait has strong examples in every specimen of
bone-tempered pottery from these sites.

Appendix G: Petrographic Analysis of Ceramic Sherds from Three Sites
Observation 3
By contrast, the bone-tempered sherds from 41MN55, a potentially much earlier Toyah
phase site, have higher proportions of bone tempering than the presidio and mission ceramics,
but the bone particles on the whole are smaller and better size sorted than the mission and
presidio specimens. The 41MN55 specimens lack any particles in the granule category and have
only trace amounts of bone in the very coarse sand category.
Figures G.1 and G.2 compare a representative sample from Mission San Sabá (PAI-108)
with one from 41MN55 (PAI-115). These graphs show the bone temper size category differences
clearly. Figure G.1 displays all of the bone variables, while Figure G.2 excludes all categories not
represented in either thin section. The median size category of all the 41MN55 thin sections is
fine sand, versus medium sand for the presidio and mission ceramics.
CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS
Implication 1
The manufacture of the Fivemile Crossing site pottery, through preparing and sorting
larger amounts of fresh bone, shows greater time and energy investment than the presidio and
mission ceramics. The latter ceramics also show greater use of expedient materials, namely
easily prepared weathered and cancellous bone types. By contrast, the 41MN55 sherds lack
eight of the weathered bone types and contain no cancellous bone whatsoever.
Implication 2
By virtue of a single mission sherd that lacks bone temper (PAI-106) but is visually
similar to the other mission sherds, it appears that the ceramic clays used by some mission
potters were capable of producing successful earthenware firings without bone temper. It may
be that bone tempering served as a form of insurance in a ceramic material to heighten the
probabilities of success. Another possibility is that bone tempering may amount to a somewhat
relict manufacturing step pioneered in another zone or region where the local clays truly
required the addition of bone temper to achieve good firings. One possible implication is that
bone-tempered earthenware technology itself may have been imported to the Edwards Plateau.
Implication 3
The greater innovation and use of expedients in the mission and presidio ceramic samples
imply that the production centers had more rapid and perhaps higher volumes of production of
bone-tempered ceramics. This suggests higher consumption, perhaps including mass production
intended for export. This implication must remain conjectural, however, and requires further
research.
Rapid production and higher volumes address another research issue. Accelerated
application of aboriginal technology for production fails to support hypotheses of replacement
of aboriginal crafts and goods with European goods and technology, although certainly this
was a long-term effect of the historic period. Further, the greater use of expedients and morerapid production does not in itself imply a reduction in quality or desirability of the mission
and presidio pottery versus the aboriginal pottery. The desirability of the goods may have
actually heightened, and this change in the perceived value of the ceramics stimulated further

production. Direct comparative tests of quality (hardness tests, porosity, refractory tests, and
others) could be performed on these and similar specimens to gain relevant insights, but such
tests lie beyond the scope of this study.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The petrographic analysis performed on a sample of the bone-tempered ceramics from
Presidio San Sabá (41MN1), Mission San Sabá (41MN23), and the Fivemile Crossing site
(41MN55) showed marked and patterned differences in the application of the bone-tempered
ceramic technology. Ceramic materials appear to similar overall, but there are significant
differences. The five sherds from Presidio San Sabá are distinctively different from six of the
seven sherds from Mission San Sabá, and one sherd from the mission is distinctively different
in materials and technology from the others there.82 These data suggest at least three different
points of origination for the presidio and mission plainwares. The ceramics from the nonEuropean Fivemile Crossing site show relatively well-sorted bone temper in smaller size and
shape classes than the more poorly sorted larger bone temper that characterizes the presidio
and mission pottery. Further, the mission and presidio ceramics lack any hint of the introduction
of European ceramic-making techniques and technology.
The general conclusion to be made from the point of view of ceramic technology is that
diverse techniques were at work within the sphere of bone-tempered ceramics of the protohistoric
and early historic periods. The ceramics from the Fivemile Crossing site show greater time and
energy investment in the production of the pottery, whereas the mission and presidio potteries
show more-expedient, hence more-rapid, production. These differing production qualities imply
differing functional trajectories and production goals. Utilitarian usage as containers was
certainly a goal in all cases. At the mission and presidio, production for participation in trading
networks either as trade items or as containers for trade commodities remains a possibility for
further research. The production of bone-tempered ceramics at the mission and presidio suggests
that, rather than dying out under replacement by European pottery and metal implements,
aboriginal ceramics and their producers were active and adaptive participants in the economic
systems of these farthest outposts of a European power.

Chet Haley, the former Menard Irrigation Company president,
did extensive research on the Menard canal. He also knew
about the link between the Anglo canal and the Spanish ditch.
In 1995, at the age of 80, Haley stated that the ditch had at
one time run through town north of San Saba Street rather
than along Canal street, as it does today. He also said that the
“ditch did make use of [the] Spanish acequia.”

Most of the modern irrigation system was constructed beginning in 1874, but many sources show that part of the main
canal followed an abandoned Spanish acequia (irrigation canal).
The Spaniards who lived at Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas
(popularly known as Presidio San Sabá) between 1757 and
1772 constructed the original acequia. A survey map and field
notes by John Dexter, who surveyed the ditch route in 1875,
leave little doubt that the canal built in 1874 followed one
section of the 1757–1772 Spanish acequia. In fact, the survey
notes detail the precise point where the irrigation canal tied
into the “Old Spanish Ditch.”

Early History of the Menard Irrigation Canal

The historic settlement of Menard was made possible in part
by an early irrigation system that provided water for farming
the San Saba River valley. Portions of this system are now 250
years old and were incorporated into an extensive network of
canals that is operated today by the Menard Irrigation Company.
The modern system consists of a main canal approximately
10 miles long and numerous lateral ditches extending down
the river valley parallel to FM 2092 east and west of Menard.
The main canal begins about 5 miles west of Menard, runs
eastward through town, and finally ends about 5 miles east of
town. The system has a long and interesting history, beginning
with Spanish settlement of the area in 1757. The “modern”
canal dates to 1874, and various parts of the canal and lateral
system have been expanded and improved many times. This
historic irrigation system still provides water to approximately
2,000 acres of privately owned lands in the San Saba River
valley.

250 YEARS OF AGRICULTURAL HISTORY,
1757–2007

William J. Vaughan came to Menard County in 1866. Realizing
the potential the canal held for irrigating fields as well as
attracting settlers, Vaughan decided to harness the waters of
the San Saba River and persuaded James W. Comstock and
William J. Tipton to join the venture. The Menard Irrigation
Company was chartered by Vaughan, Comstock, and Tipton
in 1870, and the deed for this purchase was filed on December
2, 1871. A second charter was filed on July 24, 1874, to channel

The Menard Irrigation Company:
“The Life-Blood of Agriculture” in the San Saba Valley

John Dexter’s 1875 survey notes describe the irrigation canal as running
along the “Mountain Side” then intersecting the “Old Spanish Ditch” at
“Point Mountain.” The point where the 1874 canal tied into the 1757–1772
Spanish acequia is just south of FM 2092 West, about one-half mile west
of its intersection with U.S. Highway 83.

acequia were to provide “some means of transporting rock
across the stream, to be used in building the rock walls of the
presidio and compound,” and “for irrigation purposes.” Pierce,
then editor of the Menard News and Messenger, went on to
suggest that the Spanish built rafts to float the rocks “up the
canal to the river.” Although the use of the canal to transport
construction materials is debatable, and no rock quarry has
been identified, historic records show that the acequia was
used to irrigate fields near the presidio.

Map of the Presidio San Sabá area drawn by military engineer Joseph de
Urrutia in 1767. It shows the presidio just north of the “Rio de Sn Saba”
and the “Acequia para regadio”, or irrigation canal, on the south side of
the river.

At the time of the 1876 initial inspection, the ditch was 4 miles
long. However, on September 23, 1876, Governor Richard
Coke did not approve the ditch, stating, “This report showing
the ditch to be in an unfinished condition is not approved.”
Vaughan appointed John Dexter to be the agent to the General

This mention of an “old ditch,” with its length stated in varas
(a standard Spanish measurement equal to 33 1/3 inches),
almost certainly refers to the Spanish acequia. By tapping into
the abandoned but still usable ditch, the company benefited
greatly.

...constructed on the line of a ditch made prior to the Act of
the 10th March, 1875, entitled “An Act to Encourage the
Construction of Canals and Ditches for Navigation and
Irrigation”...that part of the ditch...is 1458...varas in length.
From the best information that I can obtain, the old ditch
has saved the Company about one fourth the work of construction.

On July 19, 1876, a field inspection was conducted and recorded
by Henry C. King, who served as the “Commissioner of Canals
and Ditches West of the Colorado River” under Governors
Richard Coke and R. B. Hubbard. In his report, King describes
the first mile of the ditch as being:

Menard County court records from June 3, 1874, record
additional difficulties for the irrigation company. The court
case shows that William Graham, a landowner west of Menard,
did not approve of the “destruction” crossing his land.
Eventually, the canal was put through his land, but he got his
revenge when “ditch hands” allegedly working for Vaughan
cut Graham’s fence. Graham charged Vaughan $11 for repairs
to his fence.

Construction of the dam and ditch began in 1874. Vaughan’s
crew used picks, shovels, and eventually added a scraper or
slip pulled by a team. However, there were problems with the
initial layout of the ditch. Apparently, Vaughan hired a less
than reliable surveyor, and approximately 1 mile of the excavated ditch was not effective, costing the company greatly in
lost time and money. John F. Dexter surveyed the ditch route
in 1875, compiling a detailed map and surveyor notes. His
records provide an excellent snapshot of what the early system
was like.

The original plan of the canal was approximately 15 miles
longer than the finished modern-day canal, but Vaughan’s
1874 original canal only went 2 miles east of town. The license
to operate the irrigation canal was $20 per year. Capitol stock
in the company was fixed at $50,000, and 100 shares were
issued.

water from the San Saba River “commencing five miles above
the town of Menardville and to extend 20 miles below the
town.” The canal was to be constructed for the purposes of
agricultural irrigation, various mill operations, and mechanical
uses. Charles Shriner, J. A. Conway, L. L. Russell, L. M. Chastain,
J. W. Ellis, and J. L. Noguess may also have participated in the
second charter. At one time, two or three gristmills and a cotton
mill operated along the ditch, but Chet Haley noted that the
“State came through and forbid [the] generation of power.”
The gristmill that is on display in the Menardville Museum
reportedly dates to the 1880s and was found buried 12 feet
underground at the site of Otto Korzik’s gristmill.

The Menard irrigation canal also impacted social life in Menard in other ways, and there are
many local stories involving the ditch. An ex-Texas Ranger once told Chet Haley that there
had been four saloons in town. When drunks got too rowdy, they were dunked in the ditch
to sober them up.

In 1905, Noyes formed the Menard Irrigation Company, and the system irrigated about 2,000
acres in the San Saba River valley. Once a steady supply of water was established, the valley
was able to produce cotton, corn, oats, potatoes, melons, and “garden truck” (produce). Pierce
described the canal as the “life-blood of agriculture in the valley of the San Saba in Menard
County.” At that time, the normal ditch flow was 17.5 cubic feet per second, and Noyes
reportedly profited $20,000 per year from his irrigation project and farming ventures. After
30 successful years operating the irrigation system, he sold the canal to interested persons.

Noyes employed approximately 100 workers, and within two years there were eight miles
of canal through the valley. These workers probably lived in the community of Sunnyside,
about 4 miles east of Menard on FM 2092. Historical research suggests that the community,
little more than a tent camp, was the home to the “ditch hands” as well as workmen for Noyes’
farm and cotton gin. Several historic archeological sites recorded in this area probably represent
the remains of the Sunnyside community.

In 1886, engineer Gus Noyes (also spelled Noyas) moved from Maine to settle in Menard.
Seeing the possibilities of irrigation in the area, he quickly obtained 56 of the 100 available
shares and interested others to join him in continuing the development of the canal and
irrigation system. He built a dam across the river in about 1890. On August 4, 1904, Noyes
purchased the remaining shares of the company from J. W. Vaughan, the son of William J.
Vaughan. The elder Vaughan died on December 28, 1891, having never used water from the
canal to irrigate his land, although he reportedly had “sunk” $12,000 into its construction.
His widow bought water from Noyes at the going rate of $2 per inch per acre for 10 years.
Mrs. Whittie Vaughan Noguess, the daughter of William J. Vaughan, stated that Noyes also
dug the canal deeper and “changed the course of the old chartered line, about 200 yards
east of the west line of the old Arnet Tipton survey of land and made what he called a surface
ditch.” This change in the route then avoided Vaughan’s land, preventing him from using
the water.

Land Office on October 10, 1876. On January 26, 1877, King advised the Governor that a
rock obstruction had been removed, and the ditch finally passed inspection on February 2,
1877. On March 5, 1877, the company received $5,000 in bonds for the canal for a 10-year
period.

Presidio

A 1901 map drawn by Menard
County surveyor Arthur Striegler with important
annotations by Menard’s first county judge, J. J. Callan, provided many clues about the route and history of the
irrigation canal. The map shows the irrigation canal that ran down the San Saba River valley from the “new dam,”
through Menard, and ended east of town near the confluence of Scalp Creek. The new dam was probably the
one built by Gus Noyes in 1890. Callan also wrote on the map that, “The present irrigation system is very nearly
the same as 150 or 160 years ago. The same ditch carrying the water into Menardville valley 150 years ago
around the point of mountain, is the one now used.” The irrigation canal converges with a canal that flows from
the “old dam” just west of “Fort San Saba.” This point is below bluffs just west of Menard, and it is probably the
spot where the 1874 canal converged with the Spanish acequia. The map also shows a second canal coming off
the main canal and running south and east through the town of Menard, along with the notation that this area
was “cultivated 150 years ago.” Continuing eastward, the map shows the canal headed out of Menard, where it
converges with a third canal that appears to represent Harris Hollow. Finally, the canal ends east of Menard near
a point labeled “Presidio. Smelter.” Accumulations of burned Spanish artifacts have been found at Mission San
Sabá, and Callan may have believed this location to be a smelter associated with the presidio.

The portion of the canal that runs through town is locally
known as “The Ditch,” and it has become a tourist attraction
for the community because of its historical importance. This
year—2007—is the 250th anniversary of the founding of
the Spanish mission and presidio on the San Saba River. It
is also the 250th anniversary of irrigated agriculture in the
San Saba valley at Menard. A stroll through town along the
scenic “ditch walk” is a historic journey indeed!

The canal remains in use today and is operated by the Menard
Irrigation Company. Currently, 20 shareholders pay annual
dues to participate in the irrigation canal. Dues were increased
from $100 to $150 in 2003. Additional payments allow each
shareholder an allotment of 4.25 hours of water, which runs
on a 17-day cycle. Recent improvements include replacement
of the old flume at Las Moras Creek in 1975, and cleaning
and updates between 2000 and 2003 that cost $90,000.

Maintenance and repairs were
a constant concern for irrigation
companies, as shown in this
1910 photograph of workmen
cleaning the Menard irrigation
canal. According to an 1898 U.S.
Geological Survey report on water supply and irrigation systems, the canal route was considered to be “irregular and
unsuitable,” but cutting and filling repairs were made. A uniform drop of 30 inches to the
mile was found to be ideal, striking a balance between siltation
and erosion.
