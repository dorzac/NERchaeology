ABSTRACT
The second and final season of salvage excavations at Coral Snake
Mound is reported. Excavations demonstrate that the mound was built in
three stages. Several artifact caches together with a number of cremations
and burials were recovered. Bone tempered (Caddoan-appearing) sherds
were found together with a number of Lower Valley wares including
Marnsville Plain, Marksville Incised and Lake Borgne Incised. It is sug
gested that this association argues for a reconsideration of Krieger’s align
ment of Alto I with Marksville-Hopewell.
INTRODUCTION
The Coral Snake Mound (X16SA48) was investigated early in 1965
by personnel of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project under the
direction of Burney McClurkan. McClurkan’s report (1966) describes
the physical appearance of the mound prior to excavation and its
archeological content.
Coral Snake Mound is located in the NE 1/4 of the SE 1/4 of Section
33, T6N, R 13 W, in Sabine Parish, Louisiana. The mound itself was
situated on a terrace remnant of the Sabine River, well within its
flood plain. We were informed by a man who once owned the property
that at the turn of the century, the mound and surrounding area was
devoid of vegetation and that all of the area but the mound was planted
in cotton. Around 1910, the area was abandoned, and now thick stands
of large mixed pine and hardwoods together with dense undergrowth
cover the area.
The following report describes the 1966—1967 excavations at the
mound. Fourteen days were spent excavating the remaining portions
of the mound (Fig. 1). The unexcavated portions included the south
easteni quarter and sections of the other quadrants. It was hoped that
further excavation in these areas would give us information on mound
construction and provide a more complete artifact sample. Previous
investigations had recovered what appeared to be Caddoan sherds
(incised decoration and bone temper) together with Marksville pot
tery. The unique nature of this apparent association gave further
impetus to our second season at the mound.
The advice and criticism of several persons was of considerable

help during the analysis of materials from Coral Snake Mound.
Edward B. Jelks, R. K. Harris and Burney McClurkan offered valuable
suggestions throughout all phases of this report. Kathleen Gilmore and
Lawrence Aten assisted with the ceramic analysis. Mark Parsons
served as field assitant during our work at the mound, and James V.
Sciscenti helped edit portions of the manuscript.
EXCAVATION PROCEDURES
Initial steps in excavation consisted of removal of slump sand and

CORAL SINAKE MOUINI)

I.E

cleaning the surface of vegetation; backdirt from the 1965 season was
shifted from the lower parts of the mound. During the clearing, a
number of survey stakes and pins were found. An expanded and cor
rected grid was set up utilizing these stakes, thus tying our data in
with McClurkan’s.
Artifactual material and features were relatively scarce in the
mound fill. Because of this, unexcavated areas rather than squares
were the excavation units. The various areas were shovel scraped
horizontally, and deeper tests were made for profiling the remaining
portions of the mound.
STRATIGRAPHY
Three distinct stratigraphic zones were encountered at Coral Snake
Mound (Figs. 2 and 3).

The humus stain is due to a considerable amount of decomposed
organic matter. The soil color varies considerably, depending upon the

type of parent organic material. The zone is fairly well developed and
is uniform throughout much of the area.
Zone lilA is a mottled tan sand layer, characterized by a uniform
appearance and occasional concentrations of iron-stain lines in the
lower portion. The layer varies in thickness near the center of the
mound with a maximum thickness of 2.1 meters, which tapers to less
than 30 centimeters toward the periphery of the mound.
Zone II comprises what might be called the primary mound. The
fill is composed of a mottled brown sand with a wet consistency
similar to that of Zone lila; however, there is a noticeable color
difference when Zone II and III sands are dried and compared. Zone
II fills the subfloor basin and extends beyond the edge of the basin for
a diztance of at least one meter.
Zone I, the surface upon which the mound was constructed, is
composed of a medium grained sand containing a trace of manganese
concretions. The zone reaches a maximum depth of 1.8 meters, and
gradually grades into a red-orange sandy silt of undetermined depth.
MOUND CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING STAGES
Three distinct stages of construction are involved at Coral Snake
Mound. During the first stage, a basin-shaped depression 1.2 meters
deep and 6 meters in diameter was excavated into the existing flood
plain. The level of the floodplain was at an elevation of between
ninety-five and ninety-six feet. Subsequent to the filling of the basin,
cremations were intruded and several fire basins were prepared. Fill
for the basin extended somewhat above the original floodplain (ca.
60 centimeters to 90 centimeters at the center). Stage II, then, formed
what might be called the primary mound—a low, conical structure
about 90 centimeters high and 12 to 15 meters in diameter. Much of
this primary mound was composed of borrow from the first stage.
Apparently, fill from the basin was piled around the edges of the pit;
profiles show that some of this was left in place when refilling took
place. This undisturbed fill formed the outer edge of the primary
mound.
In the final building period, the primary mound was completely
covered with sand; at various intervals, cremations, hearths, burials
and caches were placed in the fill of the mound. Some of the fill came
from a borrow pit encircling the mound, though this borrow pit could
not have been the source for all of the fill used, as the completed
mound was 3 meters high and nearly 30 meters in diameter. No other
borrow pits were found in the vicinity of the mound.
Subsequent to the completion of Coral Snake Mound, several pot-

13

CORAL SNAKE MOUND

holes were dug into the mound. Three of these were noted by Mc
Clurkan (1966: 4—5), and two additional and apparently quite old
potholes were found during 1966. These potholes could only be seen
in vertical profile due to the nature of mound fill. Excavations were
constantly impeded by slump; a large cave-in of the north-south wall
of the southeast quarter prevented measurement of the upper portions
of these potholes, which are represented by hatched lines on the figures.
ARCHEOLOGICAL FEATURES
A total of fifty-nine archeological features were encountered during
excavations at Coral Snake Mound. These features include artifact
caches, fire basins, burials, cremations, ochre concentrations, and some
single artifact finds. Most of the features encountered during 1966,
as in the earlier work, had a funerary function. The presence of human
bone and the presence of artifact and ochre caches support this con
clusion. The highly acid nature of mound soils precluded the discovery
of intact or well preserved unburned bone. In many cases, only
enameled tooth caps which had been in contact with copper were
preserved. In spite of poor bone preservation, I believe that all artifact
caches represent burial offerings. It would appear that the Coral Snake
Mound functioned as a cemetery.
THE ARTIFACTS
A variety of artifacts were found in the mound fill and in archi
tectural features described above. The following artifact classes are
recognized for Coral Snake Mound: stone, ceramics, metal, pigment
and glass.
STONE

Large Stemmed Points (Fig. 4)
Number of Specimens: 3 (Table 1)
Dimensions: Lengths, 182 mm. and 187 mm.; widths, 56 mm. and
59 mm.; thickness, 9 mm. each for Feature 30 specimens. The point
from Feature 31 is 150 mm. long, 36 mm. wide, and 9 mm. thick.
Description: The specimen blades are symmetrical and triangular.
All three specimens have large thinning flake scars radiating from
each edge on both faces and the edges have been retouched. Well
made shoulders are present, forming a 90 degree angle with the blade
on one specimen, and being slightly barbed on the other side. Two of
the points have stems showing transverse burin blows on the base;
the remaining point has a slightly expanding stem. The two points
found in Feature 30 are made of gray (Duck River?) chert. The

Cores
A number of different core types were present at the site; the ma
jority of these are made on locally found chert pebbles. Table 2. gives
the distribution of the specimens.
Debitage and Debris
Debitage and debris from the site consists of by-products of the main
industry. Some of the flakes are residue from the preparation and
treatment of cores; others consist of trimming flakes derived from
manufacture of bifacial tools. Table 3 presents the distribution of the
material.
CERAMICS

A detailed paste and temper analysis was made on the ceramics from
Coral Snake Mound. Bone tempered sherds usually associated with
Caddoan archeological manifestations were found within the mound
fill in contexts of unquestionable Marksville age. Table 4 presents

Coral Snake Mound (Tables S and 6). The sample contains 19 copper
beads, one copper pendant, one copper earspool, and one copper frag

Beads
The copper beads are of the rolled, tubular variety. Most of the
beads are square or rectangular in cross section, suggesting that they
were beaten out on a mandril (Fig. 10, c). The round or oval speci
mens (Beads 13, 17, 18 and 19) have irregular holes, suggesting that
they were molded around soft material which was later forced out.
Preservation of the beads varies from thin patination to complete
oxidation. Beads 1 and 2 were fused by oxidation. Oxidation preserved
twine inside Beads 3,4,5,6, 7, 8 and 17 (Fig. 10, g). Beads S through
8 were found in a row and may have been part of a bracelet. Bead 17,
the largest bead found, (Fig. 10, b) weighs 44 grams.

11 mm. by 14 mm. (copper disease has probably altered the original
size of the perforation).
Description: The pendant has no apparent engraving but was beaten
together from copper nuggets. Some skin fragments are still adhering

to its underside (Table 6).
Large Rolled Cooper Bead (Fig. 10, b)
A rather large bead, this specimen (Number 18) was rolled from a
long strip of copper. The bead is 17 mm. long, 18.5 mm. wide, and has
an inside diameter of 9 mm. (Table 6).
Copper Fragment
Dimensions: Length, 24 mm.; width, 18 mm.; thickness, 0.6 mm.;
diameter of perforation, 2 mm.
Description: This is a small, perforated copper pendant or gorget
fragment. The original shape or size is not ascertainable (Table 6).
Remarks: A fragment of this specimen was sent to the Argonne
National Laboratory for trace element analysis, in an attempt to de

termine the origin of this copper. Results were inconclusive.
GLASS
Beads (Fig. 10, d and e)

Number of Specimens: 2.
Description: Both of these specimens represent Type 61 described
by Harris and Harris (1967: 145) as small, dark blue, translucent,
tube-shaped, simple beads that were tumbled. Bead Type 61 fails into
Harris’ (1967: 156) Period 2 between 1740 and 1767.
DISCUSSION
Excavations at Coral Snake Mound during 1966—1967 clarified the
origin and nature of the mound. Archeological features, for the most

part, are associated with either the second or third mound construction
stage. The first stage consisted of excavating a central basin only. The
second stage or refilling of this basin has inclusive material, as does
the cap or mound Stage 3.
A potential problem arises in separating the deliberate from the
accidental inclusions of cultural material in the mound. Some basic
assumptions must be made concerning this; the nature and source of
fill for the mound construction, as well as what might be expected in
this fill, are of major importance. A moat-like borrow pit encircled
most of the mound; this excavation may have had sufficient fill to
account for Stage 2 construction, but not for Stage 3. No other borrow

CORAL SNAKE MOUND

33

pits were found near the mound, and tests in the vicinity suggested
that no cultural material was present in the mound area before it was
constructed. Yet we have apparent random inclusions of potsherds,
dart points, debris and debitage, materials normally expected in a
midden deposit.
Burials with offerings, cremationz, large ceremonial points, copper
ornaments and ceramic vessels are not usually part of midden debris.
Such items are considered to be purposeful inclusions into the mound,
and their placement with relation to building stages bears this out to
some extent. On the other hand, the flint debris, isolated sherds and
projectile points reflect accidental inclusion into the mound fill and
their relative lack of distributional patterning bears this out to a great
extent.
With the exception of the two glass trade beads found deep in the
center of the mound, the remaining materials are prehistoric, and
either contemporaneous with or predate construction of the mound.
The distribution of various features illustrates several trends at the
site (Tables 7—11). Most of the artifact caches are concentrated in the
outer mound cap. Five additional caches found by McClurkan were
associated with this stage. The two ochre concentrations were associ
ated with the contact zone between Stages 2 and 3, and probably were
placed upon the surface of the primary mound as offerings before it
was covered up.
The fire basins (Table 8) are associated with the second stage of
construction, and the single fire basin found by McClurkan in 1965
appears to have been associated with Stage 3.
The burials at Coral Snake Mound (Table 9) are single or multiple
secondary types. Ten of these were interred during Stage 2, and two
are associated with Stage 3. The bone concentrations reported by
McClurkan apparently were associated with the latter stage.
Twenty-seven of twenty-nine cremations (Table 10) were found in
the Stage 2 fill of the mound. Few, if any, are in situ cremations, but
are secondary interments of burned bone. The large cremations found
well within the central basin, Features 54, 57 and 60, all appeared to be
in situ cremations. One cremation was found in the Stage 3 level of the
mound, and one was situated at the contact between Stages 2 and 3.
Isolated dart points, knives and potsherds were distributed in equal
quantities between Stages 2 and 3 (Table 11). Lithic artifacts were
concentrated in the Stage 2 fill with the ceramic debris clustering in
the Stage 3 portion, possibly indicating an interval between the com
pletion of Stage 2 and the construction of Stage 3, or that borrow for
the mound came from two different locales, one an essentially non-

yet, and are all generally classified as Late Archaic in East Texas.
The distribution of ceramics is more suggestive of a time differential
between Stages 2 and 3. Stage 2 ceramics include one Lake Borgne
Incised sherd, one Marksville Stamped sherd, two sherds with a lami
nated paste (probably Tchefuncte Plain), and two sand tempered

Generally, the above dates would suggest that the mound was built
in stagcs—.-—over a period of time. Sample TX-265 reflects a not-too-

unreasonable “outside” date for terminal Marksville. Sample TX-244
is obviously not associated with a Marksville building stage of the
mound, but rather with a later, perhaps historical, intrusion into the
mound.
Relationships between the Coral Snake Mound builders and other
areas are apparently somewhat diverse. The Marksville Plain vessel
found in Feature 9 appears to be a trade item from the Lower Missis
sippi Valley; similarly, the Tchefuncte Plain and Lake Borgne Incised
sherds appear to be imported. The Marksville Stamped vessel and
several Marksville Stamped sherds, on the other hand, may have been
locally made, as the paste, temper, and surface characteristics differ
from the central arid southern Louisiana materials. Explanations for
this would include Marksville women marrying into northwestern
Louisiana or perhaps the diffusion of ideas along with the trade of
imported items mentioned above. Since the Marksville Stamped ves
sel was associated with datable carbon (TX-442) and the date of 20
BC is compatible with fuilbiown Lower Valley Marksville cultural
expression, either explanation could be possible. The Caddoan sherds
from the Stage 3 portion of the mound are also locally made.
Two of the large ceremonial points were made of gray chert litho
logically similar to Duck River material in western Tennessee. Twenty
flakes of this gray chert were found in the mound fill, and these speci
mens primarily represent biface thinning or eclat de taille flakes, a
by-product of the manufacture of thin bifaces. The presence of this
material suggests that blanks or prefornis were brought into the area.
The finished products being manufactured locally. Four pink-white
novaculite eclat de taille flakes and a dart point fragment show that
novaculite was also imported. Two pieces of oolitic chert, a dolomite
flake and dart point fragment, further suggest the use of non-local
materials. The nearest known source of dolomite and oolitic chert is
the Arbuckle Mountains in Oklahoma.
There is considerable evidence for trade between the Toledo Bend
area and other areas. This trade appears to have been of a rather selec
tive nature; the presence of Lower Valley sherds in a Lower Valley
burial mound is expected. The presence of Lower Valley design ele
ments on local clays and tempers implies more than trade, i.e., an ex
change of people and/or ideas. The non-local lithic materials—Duck
River flint, novaculite, oolitic chert and dolomite were probably sought
after because they could be made into larger implements. The local
river pebbles (chert) average under 10—15 centimeters in length,

CORAL SNAKE MOUND

41

thereby precluding the manufacture of large ceremonial or burial
points.
Copper is not native to the Sabine River drainage; possible sources
for the Coral Snake copper could be northern Georgia or the Upper
Great Lakes Region. It is impossible to determine the origin of copper
ornaments from the mound until native copper trace element studies
are completed. A neutron activation analysis of two copper samples,
one from Coral Snake Mound and one from Jonas Short Mound, was
run by Dr. Richard W. Ramette, then of Argonne National Labo
ratory:
“Sample X16SA48 (Louisiana) showed a silver concentration of 290
parts per million, and a mercury concentration of 9.4 ppm.
“Sample 4ISA1OI (Texas) was: silver, 300 ppm, mercury, 16 ppm.
“Thus, the two samples do not differ much from each other, and they are
about what we would expect for native copper in this country. We have not
been able to devise, as previously hoped, a procedure for tracing copper
sack to its source. Not enough elements show up in activation analysis.”
Trade beads from a deep pothole at the center of the mound suggest
some antiquity for the disturbance. At the adjacent site (X16SA1),
an early historical artifact was found during excavations; the piece is
a cast brass French trigger guard finial, which may date to the early
or middle eighteenth century. The trigger guard was found 30 meters
due east of the mound about 1 meter below the surface. Both the beads
and trigger guard appear to represent French trade. One Carbon 14
date (TX-244) of AD 1740 from the mound agrees with the estimated
age of the historical artifacts recovered (Pearson, Davis, Tamers, 1966:
462). The relationship between the material dated and the historical
artifacts is unclear.
There is, unfortunately, little comparative data concerning the
Marksville problem, especially from the Caddoan area. The Jonas
Short Mound reported by Jeiks (1965) includes the greatest amount
of comparative material for the area. Similarities between the Jonas
Short and Coral Snake mounds include: subfloor pits with in situ
cremations, two subsequent mound building stages above the pit, bor
row pits encircling the mounds, caches of artifacts including large
ceremonial points, copper ornaments, perforated teeth and boat stones.
Jonas Short lacks: prepared fire hearths, isolated secondary cremations,
non-cremated burials, ochre concentrations and ochre with caches,
and Marksville pottery. While there are many parallels between the
two mounds, there appear to be equally as many differences, suggest
ing their construction by perhaps related, but not sanguinal, groups.

The Bellevue Mound reported by Fulton and Webb (1955) is also
an early site with Lower Mississippi Valley affiliations. The mound
had a shallow subfloor basin on a prepared clay platform containing
a flexed adult burial. Two fragmentary cremations were found near
the center the mound. Although no grave furniture accompanied the
burials, lithic and ceramic artifacts were found in the mound fill. Only
one identifiable sherd was found, a Churupa Punctated specimen.
This, together with paste and temper characteristics of the remaining
sherds, suggested a Marksville affiliation for the mound. It might be
further noted that 14 of the 752 sherds found during excavations were
bone tempered.
The Crooks Site reported by Ford ad Willey (1940) is the only
remaining well documented Marksville period burial mound. Simi
larities between the Crooks Site and the others described above, espe
cially Jonas Short and Coral Snake, are as follows; the mound was
built in three stages, had an encircling moat-like borrow pit, burials
were scattered throughout the mound, fire hearths or evidence of fire
was present, grave furniture, including pottery vessels, was present,
ground stone artifacts, ochre and copper offerings were present. One
notable absence is the apparent lack of cremations at the Crooks Site
(they were present in the other three sites). The Crooks Site is located
in central Louisiana in what might be termed the Marksville “heart
land.” So, while there are qualitative differences between these
mounds, the similarities are obvious.
It appears that the Jonas Short, Bellevue and Coral Snake Mounds
are all Marksville affiliates. Moreover, as these sites are peripheral or
marginal to the Marksville heartland, they reflect local, as well as
Marksvillian ceremonial traits. Of particular import are the bone
tempered sherds at Bellevue and the Caddoan appearing sherds at
Coral Snake. These sherds, while not assignable as yet to either the
Gibson or Fulton Aspects, or even a fuliblown Caddoan ceramic tradi
tion, are more definitely Caddoan than Lower Mississippi Valley.
Whether these Caddo-like sherds represent pre-Caddoan, proto-Cad
doan or incipient Caddoan is a moot question. The reality of the situa
tion is that bone tempered and otherwise Caddoan-like sherds are pres
ent in artificial earth works generally considered to predate anything
Caddoan by at least five hundred years. The earlier Caddoan sites—
Gahagan, Spiro, Crenshaw, and Davis—didn’t come into being over
night. They probably developed and changed as rapidly as Fulton de
velopecl from Gibson or over about five hundred years. We are not
trying to suggest that the Caddoan tradition developed out of Marks
yule, but rather that Marksville may have been the impetus or catalyst

CORAL SNAKE MOUND

43

to a number of incipient local early pottery makers that developed
into Caddos, i.e., Marksville plus local pottery wares equals early
Caddoan wares.
CONCLUSIONS
Coral Snake Mound is a component of the Marksville culture outside
what might be considered its heartland or area of expected influence.
The mound had three distinct building stages. Stage one is represented
by the excavation of a subfloor pit in which several cremations were
prepared. Stage two includes the filling of this pit and the building of
a small, circular mound above the spot. Stage three is represented by a
cap which covered the primary or stage two portion.
Certain types of features were essentially unique to either the pri
mary mound or mound cap. Caches were for the most part associated
with the mound cap, ochre concentrations between the primary mound
and the cap, fire basins with the primary mound, as were burials and
cremations. Points, knives and stone debris were fairly equally dis
tributed between the two construction phases. Only Lower Mississippi
Valley sherds and sand tempered sherds were found in the primary
mound, while these and numerous Caddoan sherds were found in the
mound cap.
The presence of equal arm cross design elements is not completely
unknown in Marksville and affiliated Hopewell pottery (Griffin,
personal communication), but they are indeed rare. The association of
a locally made Marksville Stamped vessel with this design element
and the Caddoan sherds poses new problems. The presence of Caddoan
sherds in a peripheral Marksville mound indicates the need for further
revision of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Caddoan area sequences.
It would appear from this new evidence that alignment of Alto I with
Marksville-Hopewell by Newell and Krieger (1949: Fig. 66) was
correct.
We argue for consideration of this alignment because of the follow
ing reasons. Caddoan-like sherds were well within the mound cap or
Stage 3 portion of the mound, and were at a minimum of three feet
below the surface of the mound. McClurkan’s AD 300 (TX-265) is
compatible as to the building stage and elevation, with many Caddoan
like sherds found within the mound. Coral Snake Mound is a mixture
of local and foreign ideas—it is not pure Marksville, nor is it pure
Sabine River-Toledo Bend. The mound site itself seems to have been
the focus of human activity for a long period of time, since we have
Archaic, Marksville and Historic use of the same site. The mound cap
may well represent a “last gasp” of Marksville-inspired veneration of

44

the dead by descendants of the mound’s builders who, by that time, had
accepted, invented or evalued a ceramic-making tradition now known
as Caddoan.
