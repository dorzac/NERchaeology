ABSTRACT
The Gaulding site, 41JF27, was excavated in 1965 by the participants in the fourth summer field school of the Texas
Archeological Society. Supplementary investigations were canâied out in 1974 and 1995-96. A Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric shell-bearing site, Gaulding is located in extreme southeast Texas near Sabine Lake and the Gulf shore. In 1965,
stratigraphic tests were placed in several areas of the site and numerous auger borings and profile trenches recorded its mass
and stratigraphy. In 1974, additional testing was carried out in the ceramic deposits at the site. And in 1995-96, soil borings
were placed around the siteâs periphery and one of the 1965 excavations was reopened. In the latter, the stratification was
recorded in detai!, bulk samples and radiocarbon samples were taken from all stratigraphic layers, and two cores collectively
penetrating the entire thickness of the site were taken.
In the aggregate, this testing provides an understanding of the siteâs place in the landscape, its periods of use, and the
potential for future investigation. The overall depositional structure of the site was identified and dated with a series of seven
radiocarbon dates. The formation of the siteâs layers was examined as closely as possible with outcrop descriptions and
particle analysis of the bulk samples. The ceramic technology was closely examined, a preliminary estimation of subsistence
activity was identified, and a single human burial was described. A moderate-sized collection of terrestrial gastropods
suggested a picture of evolving climate at the site and geological evidence permitted an initial description of the place of the
site in the regional landscape of Taylor Bayou drainage basin.
The first of three periods of use and accumulation at the Gaulding site occurred between 4000 and 3700 calibrated radiocarbon years ago. After a hiatus the site was used again from around 2900 to 2700 calibrated radiocarbon years ago. Finally,
after another hiatus, the site was used sporadically from around 2000 to about 600 calibrated radiocarbon years ago. Use of
the site during the latter period was rare and accumulated much less refuse than during the earlier periods of site use.
An unexpected outcome after reviewing all of the landscape, geological, and archeological evidence of the Gaulding site and
its environs, was that its history is most consistent with a model of Late Holocene small-scale sea level fluctuations that was
initially proposed by W. E Tanner (1991 and earlier papers). To the extent that relevant data are available, the Tanner model
seems to account for the times of archeological deposition, the location, geometry and orientation of the shell deposits, and
much of the material content of the archeological deposits.
Very few artifacts were found in deposits of the three periods of accumulation at Gaulding except for ceramics in the third
and last period of site use. Although the ceramics collection is small, examination of the paste characteristics yielded new
information about technological distinctions between several of the named pottery varieties. Most notable is that the sand
temper sources for OâNeal Plain variety Conway appear to be similar to and probably taken from point bar deposits in either
the lower Neches or the lower Sabine rivers.
Gaulding and the other sites in the Taylor Bayou drainage basin are important localities for further archeological and
geoarcheological investigations. Although the basin has far fewer sites than the nearby Neches and Sabine river floodplains,
it is less susceptible to overbank flooding, sedimentation, and erosion. Taylor Bayou is an environment in which preservation of subtle environmental perturbations - especially those due to sea level - may be more likely. Testing many of the
preliminary environmental history suggestions developed in this study can be done through more detailed site survey in
areas of the basin where settlement is implied by the Tanner model. The Gaulding site is interesting also for its extensive and
relatively easy to distinguish deposits of late Middle Archaic or early Late Archaic age. This is a site that has substantial
remaining information potential.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This project benefited from the interest and assistance of many people, first and foremost of whom were the field school
participants. Their numbers reached 50 at times and they are identified in Appendix A. Director of the field school was
Dessamae Lorrain assisted by Burney McClurkan and Dorris Olds. Curtis Tunnell, Dave Dibble, E. Mott Davis, and Cecil
Calhoun rendered other essential assistance. Charles N. Bollich and Lorraine Heartfield directed local arrangements. Pe>
mission to enter the land and to excavate was given by the late Fred Gaulding. Walter Ortego, who leased the property for
agricultural purposes, showed continual interest in the work and was of groat assistance pulling vehicles from the mud with
his tractor and in backfilling the excavations. The authors also wish to thank James Burrell for permission to conduct the
1995-96 work at the site.
Our appreciation is further extended to R.M. Malina and A1 B. Weso!owsky, then of the University of Texas at Austin, who
examined the skeleton recovered from the site and provided essential information about the physical evidence. Dee Ann
Story provided important advice on certain of the ceramics as well as assisted in the 1996 fieldwork at the site. Kenneth M.
Brown, now staff archeologist at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory but also a participant in the field school,
analyzed the snails collected in 1965. Richard A. Fullington analyzed the second collection of terrestrial snails obtained in
1995 and provided important ecological insights. We are very grateful to Billy Max Davidson who identified the field school
faunal remains in his usual thorough manner. Thomas R. Hester, former Director of TARL, made arrangements for artifact
photography and for the identification of the Art Museum excavationâs faunal material by Laura J. Froehlich. Darrell Creel,
formerly Curator and now Director of TARL, and Laura Nightingale, TARL Curator, were always helpful in finding stored
collections and in arranging loans.
We also thank Carolyn Murphy and Jan Stokes of the Galveston District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, for their assistance
in searching for and making available Taylor Bayou engineering boring records. Ronnie Van Pelt of the Texas Department of
Transportation provided boring logs taken at the State Highway 73 bridge crossing on Taylor Bayou. Kim A. Cox generously
provided examples of oyster shells exhibiting the damage caused by various predators. Paul Goldberg, of Boston University,
was extremely generous in assisting with both technical advice and assistance in collecting, hardening, and cutting the
geoarcheological cores and for interpreting the thin-sections. Michael B. Collins, then President, and the officers of the
Texas Archeological Society were most generous in providing funds for radiocarbon dates and for thin-section preparation.
We are grateful for their patience, and particularly that of the late Bill Richmond, as the authors plodded along toward
completion of this report. Finally, we are grateful to Dee Ann Story and Richard A. Weinstein for reviewing and providing
detailed comments on the first draft of this manuscript.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

The Sabine Lake area is home to much of the rich record
of northern Gulf of Mexico coastal prehistory. Characteristic
artifacts found in site surveys represent all the major culture-historical periods known for the coastal plain beginning with those from important Paleo-Indian localities. Continuing from an unknown time in prehistory to at least the
early historic period, the Sabine Lake area was the western
margin of the territory occupied by the western, or "sunset,"
bands of the Atakapa tribes (Aten 1983b:38-39; Kniffen et al.
1987:46; Newcomb 1961:315). The Western Atakapa was one
of several tribal groups, possibly related by language, that
formerly occupied the region roughly bounded east and west
by the Calcasieu and Brazos rivers, and extending some 250
km inland to the southern margin of the Caddo homeland
(Story 1990:256-258; cf. Aten 1983b:Figure 3.1).
These groups shared some technological characteristics of southeastern Woodland cultures, especially in ceramics (for discussion, see Story 1990:256 and citations). To
avoid confusing these Texas and Louisiana cultures that
were peripheral to the southeastern U.S. with the more typical use of the Woodland culture concept, Story proposed
that the region incorporating Sabine Lake (Figure 1 insert)
be known as the territory of the Mossy Grove tradition (Story
1990:256). Mossy Grove, a small community just south of
the Trinity River in Walker County, Texas, is a name with no
prior archeological usage. As such, it may be a useful term to
distinguish these southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas
cultures from other nearby, but also distinctive culture-geographic entities such as the Caddo area, the Lower Mississippi Valley, the Western Gulf tradition, and so on. The Mossy
Grove tradition also provides a unifying concept for the
archeology of an interstate region that helps avoid artificial
distinctions driven by modern political subdivisions.
The territory of the Western Atakapa today is one of
the least known sections of the Mossy Grove tradition. Even
though numerous archeological sites had been discovered
in the Sabine Lake area by the mid- 1960s, little was known

about them other than the presence of certain typologically
distinctive lithic and ceramic artifacts. In an effort to realize
some of the information potential of this poorly known region, the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) chose the
Gaulding site, 41 JF 27, (Figure 1) as the venue for their
Fourth Summer Field School. This was held from June 12-19,
1965 (Bollich 1965; Davis, 1965; Richmond et al. 1985). The
field school program was conducted under the general supervision of Dessamae Lorrain who was assisted by Burney
McClurkan and Dorris Olds. This TAS field school was the
first professionally directed excavation in an upper Texas
coast shell site since the 1930âs.
In 1974, the Beaumont Art Museum (now the Art Museum of Southeast Texas) sponsored a very limited excavation at Gaulding under the supervision of C.N. Bollich as
part of a program to orient young people to the nature and
importance of archeological sites and their preservation. Finally, after agreeing to prepare a report on the Gaulding excavations, in 1995 and 1996 the present authors revisited
Gaulding to obtain soil borings and to re-sample some of the
strata for matrix and radiocarbon analyses.
The Gaulding site is located on Taylor Bayou, within
the most important local drainage network immediately west
of Sabine Lake. Today, as well as in prehistoric times, this
drainage system collects the majority of runoff water for all
of Jefferson County and funnels it into lower Sabine Lake.
The natural and cultural environment of the Taylor Bayou
drainage basin is the setting for the Gaulding site and wil! be
the principal geographic context throughout this report. Insofar as retention of archeological sites is concerned, the
middle to upper Taylor Bayou drainage basin appears to be
relatively little modified. The primary developments have
been flood control projects in which a number of channel
meanders were straightened. With some exceptions, agriculture and oil and gas production have not occurred in such
close proximity to the bayous and their floodplains as to
endanger archeological sites. However, despite some infor-

Chapter 1: Introduction

mal surveying there are no sites yet recorded from the lower
Taylor Bayou basin, downstream from the Highway 73 bridge
crossing. This is an area in which much industrial development, channel modifications, and marsh subsidence have
occurred. It probably will never be known how many archeological sites were lost there but we would have expected
at least a few shell sites originally to be present.
THE SABINE LAKE AREA LANDSCAPE
As described above, the region shown on Figure 1 approximates the territory currently understood to be that inhabited by the Western Atakapa bands in the early historic
period and probably earlier (Aten t 983b). On the whole, this
regionâs physiography is a flat to gently rolling surface. Indeed, when in remote parts of the prairie or marshes today, it
often is reminiscent of being adrift on an ocean. The landscape of the Sabine Lake area is comprised of several habitats used by native peoples for food, material resources, and
activities. These include the Gulf beaches and coastal
marshes, Sabine Lake itself, the Sabine and Neches rivers
and their floodplains, the interior woodlands that begin a
few miles north of Beaumont, and the vast upland prairies
(Figure 1). The Gulf of Mexico is not included in this landscape concept because there is no information at present to
indicate systematic use of maritime resources by people here
other than what appears to be occasional scavenging along
beaches.
The first landscape zone behind the Gulf beaches includes the vast, flat, coastal marshes and lakes with mixed
salt, brackish, and even freshwater habitats known as the
Southern Cordgrass Prairie (Kuchler 1975). In 1861 a visitor
here noted that;
"From the High Islands [near Galveston Bay, see Figure 1] to the Sabine all is prairie, in some places impassable
marsh to a breadth of seven miles in the wet season, small
bayous running through in various directions and entering
the lake or ponds. Firm land at all seasons can not be found
short of from six to nine miles from the coast, and in many
places not short of fifteen or twenty miles. In very violent
southerly winds nearly all the prairie for some distance back
to the shore is covered by water from the Gulfââ (Kennedy
1892:69).
In fact, the maximum recorded height of a storm surge at
Sabine Pass is 2 m (White et al. 1987:12), an elevation that
would flood the low coastal marshes all the way inland to
Taylor Bayou. Nevertheless, the intensive use of this zone
by native peoples is clearly indicated by the numerous shell
and non-shell habitation sites that exist, or once existed,
along the lakes and streams.
Inland from the marshes is the coastal prairie, a similarly
vast expanse of flat to gently rolling prairie known to ecologists as the Bluestem-Sacahuista Prairies (Kuchler 1975).
This coastal prairie was described by a traveler in the early
19th century as a "...generally barren prairie, destitute of
trees, except on the margin of the water-courses" (Weniger

3

1984:24). The next zone inland is the interior woodland, a
moderately dissected upland with mixed pine and hardwood
forest interspersed with small prairies, and known as the
Southern Mixed Forest and Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest
(Kuchler 1975). As one proceeded northward these woodlands closed in until, as another traveler wrote, they were
"...an almost continuous forest" (Weniger 1984:25). It seems
very likely that the edge between the interior woodlands
and the coastal prairies was regularly visited for its resources.
However, there presently is no information about whether
the coastal Indians also routinely penetrated the interior
woodlands to any extent for their subsistence or activities
other than traveling to villages of other native groups. There
have not been any extensive surveys of the southern part of
the interior woodlands, but the indication at present is that
there may be fewer archeological sites here than in the other
zones.
Crosscutting the three coast-parallel zones (i.e., coastal
marsh, prairie, and woodlands) are the extensive lakes,
streams, marshes, and swamps of the Neches, Sabine, and
Calcasieu river floodplains. Upstream the floodplains contain mixed fluvial woodlands of the Southern Floodplain
Forest (Kuchler 1975). A mid-19â~â century attempt to cross
the Neches River and pass through its floodplain forests
during a wet season was described as practically impossible
(Olmsted 1978:376-378). A substantial part of the floodplainâs
downstream extent is fresh and brackish marshtand with the
latter containing many archeological shell sites. These rivers ultimately drain into Sabine and Calcasieu lakes. The
potential estuarine characteristics of these lakes have been
largely eliminated by the natural near-closure of their seaward ends by sedimentation causing them to be essentially
freshwater environments. Early descriptions of Sabine and
Calcasieu lakes indicate they were very shallow (approximately 1-2 m). A 19âh century source described Sabine Lake
as "fresh water" (Weniger 1984:161), a condition likely to
have existed throughout recent millennia. In these respects,
the coastal extremity of the Neches and Sabine rivers is more
like south Louisiana than like most of the Texas coast.
The Sabine Lake area today is a very wet place, but to
what extent this might have been the case in prehistory is
not yet known. In Jefferson County, the Texas jurisdiction
including the major cities of Beaumont and Port Arthur, the
Taylor Bayou drainage basin, and the Gaulding site, average
annual precipitation ranges from 44 to more than 56 inches
(1.1-!.4 m) with many years exceeding this amount. Twice in
the 20âh century annual rainfall totals in the county approached 100 inches (2.5 m). Twice in recent years nearly 20
inches (.5 m) of rain fell in a single day (Bomar 1983). Because of the moderating influence of the Gulf of Mexico, the
area averages only one day per year exceeding 100 degrees
and 16 occurrences per year of freezing temperatures. The
hottest and coldest temperatures ever recorded for the area
were 107 and 1 ! degrees respectively (Bomar 1983).
Geologically, the coastal prairies originated as a Pleis-

4

Test Excavations at the Gaulding Site (41JF27), ,l~âersâon Count3; Texas

tocene deltaic plain, formed by the coalescence of several
ancient river deltas during the Sangamon interglacial. These
deposits are known as the Beaumont Formation in Texas
and the Prairie Formation in Louisiana. Falling sea level at
the onset of the last glacial period, the late Wisconsinan
(Fisher et al. 1973), terminated deposition of this ancient
deltaic plain. Taylor Bayou and its major tributary, Hillebrandt
Bayou, occupy narrow valleys deeply incised into the Beaumont Formation (Kane 1959) and trace their origin to this
glacial time of lower sea level. As the glaciers waned and
Holocene sea level rose, sediments began filling the TaylorHillebrandt incised valley more or less continuously to the
present day.
Today the resulting Taylor Bayou drainage basin can
be divided readily into lower, middle and upper zones (cf.
White et al. 1987: Plate V) on the basis of their fiTinging soils
and biotic habitats. The lower basin extends from Taylor
B ayouâs outlet at lower S abine Lake upstream to j ust below
the Highway 73 bridge, a distance of about 16 kin, and consists entirely of brackish-water marshes often with standing
water. The middle basin continues upstream fiâom the lower
basin nearly to LaBelle, some 19 km along Taylor Bayou, and
to Lovell Lake, some 14 km along Hillebrandt Bayou. The
natural habitats here are a mosaic of freshwater marshes
(with and without standing water), fluvial and poorly drained
woodlands (but not swamps), and areas transitional between
wetlands and upland prairies (Figure 2). The upper basin
extends from the middle basin along Taylor and Hillebrandt
bayous and their tributaries upstream to the headwaters of
the drainage basin. The habitats in this section consist of
fluvial and poorly drained woodlands, and swamps. The
middle basin by far has the most ecologically diverse landscape and, as a result, probably had a greater plant and
animal diversity than either the upper or lower basins (cf.,
Palmisano and Chabreck 1972:2, 38). In addition, or perhaps
as a consequence, the middle basin contains nearly all the
archeological sites known in the Taylor Bayou drainage basin. It is here that the Gaulding site is located, some 25 km
upstream from the outlet at Sabine Lake.
Gaulding is situated on a slightly elevated tract of
coastal prairie known as French Island that is largely surrounded by marsh and abuts Taylor Bayou at three points.
About half the elevated "island" is heavily wooded, although
other parts are developed with rice cultivation, pasture, oil
wells and tanks, and buried pipelines. Despite this, the site
has had only modest disturbance and remains in a relatively
isolated location. The geomorphic surfaces surrounding the
site location originated in several mostly deltaic late Pleistocene depositional environments; i.e., main river channels,
distributaries, levees, and interdistributary basins. The
lithofacies of these deposits differ in permeability, slope,
and mineral composition leading to differences in the vegetative ground cover and understory that could be supported, and in the soils that were formed. Today the soil
immediately upslope from the Gaulding site is the Morey Silt

site, 41JF27; freshwater marsh in left center and fluvial woodlands

Loam, a sandy and silty soil largely derived flâom Beaumont
Formation natural levee deposits. Nearby, at and below the
elevation of the site, is the Beaumont Clay, largely derived
from Beaumont Formation interdistributary deposits, and
the Hart:is Clay, derived from the Holocene transgressive
marsh deposits (Crout et al., 1965).
The natural habitats described above for the middle
basin are, at least in general terms, probably the same that
existed over the last two millennia of prehistoric times. However, French Island has been occupied and cultivated for
nearly 150 years and much of the present vegetation also
signifies these historic uses. In 1965 the site area was only
partly wooded and had extensive clearings. The following
plants were observed in the siteâs vicinity some of which
suggest a domestic assemblage possibly associated with
the now-vanished French family homestead: hackberry, water (?) elm, holly, yaupon, hawthorne, palmetto, wild white
hibiscus, blue morning glory vine, passion flower vine, ageratum, gallardin, blackberry, honeysuckle, locust (?), and
persimmon (D. Olds, field school notes).
Today, the site is overgrown with brush (Figure 3), a
result of being overtaken by non-native Chinese tallow trees
(Sapium sebiferum). The abundant flora on the site at this
time includes hackberry, yaupon, and tallow tree accompanied in lesser amounts by sweet gum, palmetto, common morning glory, passion flower, honeysuckle, green briar, ironweed,
dewbe~Ty, blackberry, aster, Virginia creeper, Spanish moss,
locust, poison ivy and sumac, and cedar. Along the shoreline
adjacent to the site are water hyacinth, bald cypress, and
willow. This assemblage is similar to that observed in 1965
except for the substantial spreading of tallow trees (C. N.
Bollich, 1995-96 field notes). Comparing the two vegetation
lists to inventories of wetland plants in the middle Taylor
Bayou basin habitats (White et al. 1987:Table 16) indicates
that the plants on and near the Gaulding site are typical of the
fluvial and poorly drained woodlands environment. However,
they mâe accompanied by a number of non-native intrusive
plants probably associated with historic and modern settle-

ment on French Island and throughout the region.
PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK
The cumulation of archeological surveys in the Taylor
Bayou basin is extensive and thorough, although the analysis to be presented later will suggest a possibility of undiscovered sites in !ocations previously not thought to be important for prehistoric settlement. The earliest reported archeological fieldwork in the drainage basin was a site survey conducted in 1940-41 by G. E. (Gus) Arnold of the University of Texas as part of his WPA-funded survey of 16
southeast Texas counties (Im 1975). Arnold reported four
sites on French Island, including a shell midden approximately 300 feet (91 m) long and 50 feet (15 m) wide on a 6-7
foot (2 m) high bluff from which artifacts, bones and shells
were eroding. It may be that he was describing the Gaulding
site but, unfortunately, Arnoldâs map coordinates for these
sites plot nearly three miles upstream near the small community of LaBelle. Subsequent examinations of the LaBelle locations by C. N. Bollich, as well as a separate survey by
Thomas et al. (1977) have not revealed any indication of
archeological sites there. Since both the LaBelle and French
Island locations are relatively undisturbed by erosion or
land uses, sites in either place should still be evident. Further, there are no other sites of such size known in the basin,
so it seems likely that Arnoldâs map locations are wrong. In
any event he may have initially visited and collected at the
Gaulding site in 1940 and his description of a site recorded
as 41JF10 seems most similar to, and likely to be, Gaulding.
Nevertheless, the more recently assigned site number, 41JF27,
is used here for the Gaulding site.
In the mid-1960âs, archeological surveying by C. N.
Bollich led to renewed awareness of the French Island sites
and to selection of the Gaulding site for the 1965 field school.
Subsequent to that time Harry Shafer, Vance Ho!liday, Paul
Bollich, and Glen Fredlund conducted surveys of the upper
parts of Taylor Bayou, Hillebrandt Bayou, and of several

5

tributaries (Aten 1972). Additional surveys of selected locations were carried out by Pearson et al. (1982) and by Carolyn
(Good) Murphy during a low water period in 1986 (TARL
files). This work has covered, in some cases several times,
both stream banks for approximately 60 km distance and has
identified only 18 sites (excluding Arnoldâs probably
misplotted sites).
Excavations with limited controls were carried out by
local enthusiasts in the mid- 1960âs at 41JF24, the Black Hill
Mound (Figure 1). Located in a remote upstream part of the
basin near the merging of Hillebrandt and Willow Marsh
bayous, this site was an earth midden containing some shell
and several human burials (Heartfield n.d.). Then the majority of excavation at the Gaulding site reported here was carfled out in 1965 with minor additional work in 1974. In 1981,
test excavations were carried out at shell sites 41JF11 and
41JF35 (Figure 1), located on Hillebrandt Bayou. This work
produced the first radiocarbon dating of archeological deposits in the Taylor Bayou basin (Raab and Smith 1983).
Elsewhere in the Sabine Lake area there has been survey (Beavers 1978; Gibson 1978; McGuffand Roberson 1974;
McMichael and Bosarge 1979; Neuman 1977); a partial report on test excavations of pimple mound sites near Big Hill
salt dome (Aten and Bollich 1981); a partial report of excavation at a ceramic period shell-bearing site (Eddleman and
Akersten 1966); a study of site/chenier ridge relationships
(McIntire 1958; McBride et al. 1997:50-61); salvage excavations at the Holly Beach site (Stopp 1976); reports on PaleoIndian and Archaic lithic finds and geology at McFaddin
Beach (Long 1977; Turner and Tanner 1994; Pearson and
Weinstein 1983; Stright et al. 1999); and an effort to discover
and evaluate Early and Middle Holocene shell sites submerged in offshore deposits of the Sabine River valley
(Pearson et al. 1986). In addition, a preliminary ceramic chronology is available (Aten and Bollich 1969), as well as summaries integrating what is known of Sabine Lake culture
history with that of the northern Gulf Coast region (Aten
1983b; Story 1990).
RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
The 1965 field school program at Gaulding was designed
primarily to offer training in survey, excavation, and field
laboratory methods to attending members of the Texas Archeological Society (Appendix A). The principal excavations
focused on distinguishing stratigraphic layers and on determining how to correlate the separate excavation units (Davis
1965). The 1974 Beaumont Art Museum excavation had somewhat similar, if less technically intensive, objectives. In order to proceed now, decades later, with analysis of the excavation results, a more contemporary research focus is needed.
Area Overview
Chronology
The broad outlines of a local artifact chronology are
evident even though much refinement is needed. Diagnos-

tic Paleo-Indian and Archaic lithic materials are found in
abundance at McFaddin Beach and Late Archaic material is
found in numerous aceramic shell sites throughout the area.
Early ceramic to protohistoric occupations are indicated in
many sites by diagnostic decorated sherds representing
Tchefuncte, Marksville, Coles Creek and Plaquemine ceramics typical of the lower Mississippi valley as well as those
typical of the nearby Galveston Bay region. Small quantities
of Caddoan ceramics also are found in late prehistoric contexts. There is little artifactual evidence of historic period
Native Americans, although them is an ethnohistoric record
of two Atakapa villages near Beaumont on the Neches River
(Bolton 1970:334) and of another at Sabine Pass (Barroto
1987:178). Currently there are only 7 radiocarbon dates from
area sites: One on a Pleistocene elephant tusk from McFaddin
Beach (Long 1977); one on Rangia shells from a Tchefuncte
pottery-bearing deposit (Valastro et al 1975:82); two Rangia
shell dates (Eddleman and Akersten 1966) fiâom a Tchefuncte
ceramic deposit now being re-analyzed by the present authors; and three dates Dora Hillebrandt Bayou sites (Raab
and Smith 1983). For various reasons, only the latter three
dates are helpful at the Gaulding site. However, a series of 7
new dates is included here from Gaulding.
Site types/regional settlement pattern
Nearly all of the 145 prehistoric sites thus far recorded
in the Sabine Lake area are shell-bearing sites, The only
exceptions known are the apparent Paleo-Indian and Early
Archaic sites being exhumed by the surf at McFaddin Beach;
several pimple mound sites near Big Hill and Beaumont; a
small number of upland stream margin middens in the timberlands and coastal prairies of the northern part of the region; and unidentified probable non-shell sites from along
upper Spindletop Bayou where abundant ceramics were collected many years ago by a local trapper (TARL files). Prior
to 1950 a great many of the reported shell sites were large
stratified mounds, although few of these exist any longer.
Several large prehistoric cemeteries as well as smaller burial
aggregates existed at one time but never were documented;
a single burial was documented at Gaulding in ! 965, and Gus
Arnold reported possible human bones eroding from what
may have been the same site in 1940. Beavers (1978), reporting survey results from the lower Sabine River, suggested
that them were clusters of sites on tributaries of larger streams
that tended to have a large site with a wide range of faunal
and artifact material, and numerous nearby small ones with
much more limited artifacts and faunal remains. Superficially,
at least, it appears a similar site distribution may exist in the
Taylor Bayou basin also. Beavers thought this pattern might
indicate functional site differentiation, with the small sites
possibly being non-domestic, but this settlement concept
has never been tested.
Bearing in mind that extensive surveying has taken place
near Sabine Lake over the last six decades, inspection of the
distribution of shell sites (TARL files) on the Texas side of

Sabine Lake shows clusters in at least three locations probably reflecting shellfish resource availability. These locations are: 1) the lower Neches and Sabine rivers and the
intervening Sabine Lake shoreline, with about 1.4 sites/
stream km; 2) the lakes and streams of the coastal marshes
largely south of the Gulf intracoastal waterway with about 1
site/stream km; and 3) the middle roaches of the Taylor Bayou/
Hillebrandt Bayou system with 0.6 site/stream km. How or
whether the intervening areas were used is unclear, although
there are hints. The pimple mound middens at the coastal
marsh/coastal prairie contact suggest how that ecotonal region was exploited (Aten and Bollich 1981). On Taylor Bayou,
a largely east-west trending stream, sites tend to be on the
more elevated north side (left bank) which has greater accessibility to the coastal prairie, possibly to facilitate retreating from storm surges or perhaps just a general logistical
advantage. The large pottery collections Dora non-shell sites
on upper Spindletop Bayou indicate significant upstream
penetration into the coastal prairies of the interfluve between the Neches and Trinity rivers. And finally, several
uninvestigated earth middens are known along Pine Island
Bayou in northern Jefferson County, presumably reflecting
use of the ecotone between the coastal prairies and the interior woodlands.
Geoarcheology/site ,lbrmation
Many geological studies and soils surveys have been
carried out in the Sabine Lake area and Louisiana - Texas
coast yielding a general understanding of regional landscape
development (cf. Fisher et al. 1973; Crout et al. 1965). At the
archeological site level, however, little work has been done
to define site formation processes and how these may correlate with the landscape history. An analysis was published
partially analyzing pimple mound site formation (Aten and
Bollich 1981) and a bulk sample data set was collected in
1995 from Gaulding to begin analyzing shell site formation
there. In addition there are engineering boring records from
the Taylor Bayou basin that can be used to document stream
valley aggradation and its possible relation to the Gaulding
site formation. Recent geoarcheo!ogical studies at sites on
the lower Trinity River (e.g., Nordt and Jacob 1995; Nordt et
al. 1997) have identified landscape development features
that are relevant to the Sabine Lake area.
Paleoecology
Analysis of a late Pleistocene-Early Holocene vertebrate fauna being exhumed by the surf at McFaddin Beach
(Russell 1975) revealed a mix of extinct and surviving animals. Pollen and foraminifera from Early to Middle Holocene
deposits filling the offshore Sabine trench penetrated by
borings indicate floodplain environments similar to those of
today (Pearson et al. 1986) but not in the same location, of
course. Several studies have been performed on the geometry, sedimentation, paleoenvironments, and modern aquatic
habitats of Sabine Lake (Kane 1959 and 1960; Fisher et al.

Chapter 1: Introduction

1973; Anderson et al. 1991; White et al. 1987); and there has
been some description of historic landscape changes in the
region (Weniger 1984). In addition a terrestrial snail dataset
spanning much of the Late Holocene now is available from
the 1995 re-sampling of the Gaulding site.
Subsistence and seasonal movements
The principal method for seasonal site use determinations has been to evaluate Rangia cuneata growth (Aten
!981). Over time, however, various questions were raised
about the accuracy of this method (e.g., Kibler et al. 1996:6264). Recently an intensive re-evaluation of both the morphological and the microstructural techniques, as applied to R.
cuneata, was conducted as well as testing several other
approaches (Aten 1999). The new study indicated that none
of the methods tested produced satisfactory results and so
determining Rangia seasonality is not attempted on the
Gaulding samples. Small quantities of oysters are found in
some sites, including Gaulding, and may possibly be used
for seasonality studies (Cox 1994). Beyond shells, there are
the conventional seasonality data sources in faunal taxa
presence/absence, otoliths, and other vertebrate elements
that display growth cycles. At present the Gaulding and the
Pipkin Ranch faunas are the best collections available for

limited recording from the Black Hill mound in the headwaters of Hillebrandt Bayou (TARL files), and from 41OR9, a
possible mortuary mound constructed on top of a shell
mound on the lower Neches River (C. Bollich, field notes).
As a result, while some skeletal material has been recovered,
there is very little local context about mortuary ritual in which
to place the Gaulding burial.
THE GAULDING SITE
While there were no a priori reasons for expecting anything radically different from, for instance, the emerging culture-historical picture in the Galveston Bay area, the research
possibilities for the Gaulding site data were reviewed against
this just-described area-wide background to see how they
might best be used. The following observations stand out
about Gaulding:
a. There are very few artifacts, with most confined to the
upper 6 inches (15 cm) and these being mostly ceramics. Of the latter, a few were early (Tchefuncte and
Mandeville Plain) but the majority appears to postdate

subsistence and seasonality analysis, although the former
is not based on small screen mesh sampling and may be
biased against small animals.

Territoriality
Several lines of evidence (Aten 1983b) suggest that
western Jefferson County is a boundary region between the
Atakapa Indians to the east, and the closely related Akokisa
Indians to the west. This evidence includes differences in
ceramic sequences and in distribution of certain non-ceramic technology; also there is ethnohistoric evidence that
this was a tribal boundary during the historic period.

described, but with little other mortuary data from the
Sabine Lake area for comparison, it is not possible to
place this interment in the context of local burial cerc.

Technology
The only Sabine Lake area excavations for which the
artifacts are described are the Hillebrandt Bayou testing
(Raab and Smith 1983), the Holly Beach site (Stopp 1976),
and the Paleo-Indian and Archaic lithics from McFaddin
Beach (Stright et al. 1999). Beyond that there are studies of

tion on prior archeological work).
Mortuary practices
Although there is anecdotal information about the occurrence of cemeteries and individual burials from the area,
the single Gaulding interment is the most completely described. In 1956 several burials were partially described while
the site in which they were found, 41JF33, near the north
shore of Sabine Lake was being quarried for shell (TARL
files). In the 1960âs, several burials were removed with only

emonialism.
A modest collection of vertebrate food remains was recovered, although it is biased toward large animals since
small-mesh screening was not done. This sample will
permit only a broad outline of the faunal subsistence
during the siteâs occupations. Evaluation of the oyster
shell growth as well as the faunal taxa that are present
may enable an estimate of the season(s) of year the site

The 1965 stratification records were detailed but not
always consistent between excavation units. Likewise
the layer descriptions, though representative of 1960âs
documentation standards, were not as focused as they
would be today with the result that correlation of the
siteâs physical structure from unit to unit is somewhat
speculative and depends on continuity in certain gross
features.
Inspection of the 1965 bulk samples curated at TARL
also indicated that they were not consistently collected;
some were from arbitrary excavation levels, others were
from profile strata; some appeared to be complete or
bulk samples of matrix material, while others were only
washed shell; and some levels and strata were not
sampled. Certain aspects of shell analysis (e.g., habitats, changes in demographics, predators, etc.) would
be possible but a consistent analysis of physical structure and site formation would not be possible with the
available samples.

Because of the uncertainty over where and how the
1965 shell samples were collected, this material was not
reliable for radiocarbon dating.

g.

There was available a significant amount of sarvey and
some excavation data târom elsewhere in the middle Taylor Bayou drainage basin that would provide some context for the Gaulding findings.

Taken all together, it was initially assumed that the
preceramic deposits dated to earlier than 2,000 years ago,
the Tchefuncte/Mandeville pottery indicated another period of settlement around 2000 years ago, and the other ceramics indicated settlement during various times ranging to
perhaps about 600 years ago. But native use of the Gaulding
site seems unlikely to have been continuous over such a
time range; the site is too small and the artifact assemblage
too limited for this to have been the case. Nevertheless,
having such a span of occupations indicated that carefully
collecting shells for radiocarbon dating could be an important addition to the areaâs culture history.
It would be possible, also, to do technological studies
of ceramics and compare these with controlled collections
from elsewhere in the Taylor Bayou basin, and to place documentation of the human burial in the published record. We
believed it probably was possible to broadly correlate the
several 1965 and 1974 excavations in terms of major site
accretion episodes. It should then be possible to make culture-historical statements about the general t~cus of subsistence, possibly about the season(s) of settlement use,
and about changes in artifacts all correlated with these depositional episodes.
There was one aspect of the site that particularly attracted attention. There was a small but persistent occurrence of oyster shell in the 1965 excavation at Gaulding.
Oysters also have been reported from other shell sites on
nearby Hillebrandt Bayou (Aten 1972; Raab and Smith 1983)
and in several survey reports for sites on the northern end
of Sabine Lake (TARL files). This is notable because the
Sabine Lake and tributary drainages have, so far as is known,
nearly always been very low salinity habitats. Studies of
cores from the lake (Anderson et al. 1991; Kane 1961 ; White
et al. 1987) suggest that oysters may always have been confined to the extreme southern end near the outlet to the Gulf
through Sabine Pass. The one exception to this situation
appears to have been a brief interval between 3500 and 4000
years ago when higher salinity faunas appear in the cores.
Unless Indians were periodically transporting unopened
oysters from a relatively great distance, finding oysters in
the Gaulding samples suggests part of the site might be very
old, circa 4000 years ago. Alternatively, or additionally, this
might indicate the site contains archeological refuse documenting the onset and possibly the waning of the one currently known high salinity episode which appears to have
occurred in the Sabine Lake estuarine system since 4000
years ago. It is possible that other episodes of higher salin-

ity waters in the Sabine Lake system have occurred but thus
far have escaped detection in cores.
In any event, the cause of such an episode is not clear.
It may have been due to major reduction in freshwater outflow allowing Gulf waters more access to the Sabine Lake
tributary drainages. On the other hand, it may represent a
rapid small-scale rise in sea level temporm:ily giving marine
waters greater access to the lake and its tributaries. Such sea
level fluctuations are widely assumed to have occurred but
are difficult to document (cf., Prewitt and Paine 1988). If such
a rise and fall of sea level had occurred, it also would have
affected other northern Gulf bays. But since the latter are
higher salinity estuaries, any low magnitude (circa .5-1.5 m)
sea level rise might not be as visible there in the form of
invertebrate faunal changes.
We then considered what new data it might be feasible
to collect to enhance the value of what had already been
obtained without undertaking a major new excavation. Taking soil borings around the siteâs periphery, as well as reopening one of the 1965 test pits to re-document and
resample some of the physical strata, would make it possible
to place the site better in its landscape, verify the physical
stratigraphy, collect bulk samples to begin examining site
formation, and to obtain a series of radiocarbon samples. All
of these analyses would contribute important new details
about the local culture history to the original excavation
data.
EXCAVATION PROCEDURES
The Gaulding site (Figure 4) is a shell ridge approximately 107 m long by 27 m in maximum width. It ranges in
thickness from a thin lens of shell up to approximately 1.5 m.
It consists primarily of numerous deposits of the brackish
water clam Rangia cuneata. The composition was rounded
out by small quantities of other shells, artifacts, vertebrate
remains, organic detritus, and miscellaneous sedimentary
materials. The procedures employed to test this site, in the
three successive time periods of work, are described below.
Because all primary measurements were made in the English
system, these are retained here with the metric equivalent
indicated in parentheses. New measurements made for this
report, such as artifact descriptions or landscape distances
are given only in the metric system. Records and specimens
from all three periods of work at the Gaulding site are reported here and are curated at the Texas Archeo!ogical Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.
196S Excavation
A control grid was established by driving a stake every
50 feet (15 m) on the long axis of the mound commencing at
what was believed to be the southwestern extremity of the
site. This southernmost stake was arbitrarily labeled N0/

their southeast corner. The line of stakes along the axis of

locations beyond the edges of the site were surveyed

other locations.
The initial excavations began with three 5-foot (1.5 m)
grid units designated A-l, B-l, and C-1 in addition to their
grid coordinates. These were at N300/WI00, N250/W100,
and N150/W100 respectively. Placing test excavations in
widely separated areas was expected to reveal whether the
nature of deposits was similar or different over the siteâs
extent. These results were to be relied on to indicate where
additional excawttion might be fiâuitful. The initial test units
were excavated in horizontal 6-inch (15-cm) levels and the
excavated material was sifted through ~A inch (6.3 mm) mesh
screens.
All specimens were placed in general level bags labeled

were placed to make several transects: 1) approximately
perpendicular to the W100 line extending in both east
and west directions but intersecting the 1965 B-1 test
excavation; 2) perpendicular to the W 100 line intersecting the 1965 C-1 test excavation, but there was only
enough time to dig these borings on the east side of the
site; and 3) a line continuing from the north end of the
site. Because of their general similarity, only the most
complete profile, intersecting the B-1 excavation, is pre-

characteristics of the excavated matrix, unusual stratification, artifacts and other notable information for each grid

to create a stratigraphic profile showing the pre-archeo!ogical site setting and some of the modifications occurring since that time.
In addition to the soil borings, the fill was removed from

level as work proceeded. Excavation of the shell deposit
took longer and was more difficult than expected. As more
people arrived at the field school, additional grid units were

the site. A total of eleven 5-foot (1.5 m) grid units were excavated down to sterile clay along with three exploratory
trenches (Figure 4). The latter trenches were about 1.5 feet
(.45 m) wide and were dug primarily to obtain longer profiles
of the mound structure, although vertical contro! by levels
was not generally used. In addition, numerous small holes
were dug with a posthole digger to obtain information about
the shell depositâs thickness and extent.

bulk samples were collected from each stratum for physical
analysis. When the bottom of the site was reached an additional soil boring was made. To be certain that undisturbed
deposits were being examined, the exposed profile along the
west side of the original B-1 excavation was trimmed several
centimeters westward and was identified in the records as
profile B-1 (west).

CHAPTER 2

SITE FORMATION

A glance at any of the Gaulding siteâs stratigraphic crosssections shows many layers. So how did the site form? At
first the answer might seem obvious--people sitting about
the fire, opening and eating clams and oysters, and tossing
the shells nearby. Undoubtedly this is part of the answer,
but which part? Were any of the layers formed in some other
way? Were all the shellfish eaten when harvested, were they
prepared for later consumption, or were they used as bait
(cf., Claassen 1998:176-178) ? Is there evidence of structured
use and maintenance of campsite areas as is seen in some
ethnographic examples (e.g., Meehan 1982). Why do the
layers look different? To confuse matters further, the issue
of whether these shell accumulations are exclusively manmade, a question that was often raised by 19âh century natural scientists, continues to be heard a century later, even in
the Taylor Bayou basin (Raab and Smith 1983:59). As much
as we try to find certainty about shell-bearing sites, partial
answers are all that come forth.
There are three classes of evidence available for examining the formation of the Gaulding site: prehistoric setting
as expressed in external soil borings and excavations to examine the placement of the site in its local environment;
structure as expressed in conventiona! physical and cultural stratigraphy and radiocarbon dates from the excavations; and archeological sediments as expressed in bulk
samples, cores, and thin sections. Before proceeding, though,
a word about terminology is needed.
The lithostratigraphic terminology used here generally
is consistent with current geoarcheological practice (e.g.,
Stein 1990; Waters 1992). Layer is used for the sediments
between interfaces when the units could be mapped across
all or much of the excavation. They are based largely on
continuity, geometry, superposition, and to some extent,
lithologic similarity. Layer is approximately equivalent to the
term "zone" as used in the 1965 documentation. Most, but
not all, of these layers are traceable into the 1965 documentation of zones. Nevertheless, to avoid unnecessarily com-

plicating the terminology, all of the 1995 units are referred to
as layers. The term deposit is used for features and lithologic variations of more limited extent.
The bulk of the Gaulding site material is shell of the very
low salinity clam, Rangia cuneata. Scattered through these
were occasional oyster and other shells, ceramics and other
artifacts, and vertebrate food remains. Sediment comprised
mostly of fine sand, silt, and clay--along with small quantities of humus, ash and charcoal, small shell fragments, and
small bone and artifact fragments--provided the "filler."
When present, this filler is identified as matrix. Later, when
discussing the analysis of bulk samples of archeological
sediments, the definition of matrix will be refined to include
all material passing through a 2-mm (- 1~)) sieve (i.e., all very
coarse sand and smaller grain sizes).
Finally, a midden, strictly speaking, is a specific kind of
secondary deposition (cf., Schiffer 1987:58-61). The term
"shell midden," as it is commonly used, refers to a site originating from assumed, but usually unconfirmed, domestic
refuse accumulation processes. And so there is a growing
view among coastal archeologists that the term "shell-bearing" site or some other combination of less prejudicial modifiers should be used instead of the blanket use of "shell
midden" (cf., Widmer 1989; Claassen 1998:10-12). This concern underlies the general absence of the term "shell midden"
in this report.

PREHISTORIC GEOMORPHIC SETT~,IG
Like many local drainage systems on the coastal prairies during the last glacial period, Taylor Bayou entrenched
a deep, narrow alluvial valley. Even today, when this valley
is filled to the brim, the floodplain in the middle of the drainage basin on the average is not more than 1 km in width, with
the present bayou channel only about 60 m wide. At many
places in the alluvial valley, including at Gaulding, the Pleistocene uplands directly border one or both sides of the stream
channel.

Test Excavations at the Gaulding Site (41JF27), Jefferson County, Texas

The original ground surface on which the site was established was the soil developed on the surtâace of the late
Pleistocene Beaumont Formation (Figure 5; see Appendix B
for lithologic descriptions). This paleosol at the top of the
Beaumont and underlying the Gaulding site may be equivalent to the Wallisville Paleosol identified in field studies on
the east side of the Trinity River valley some 57 km due west
(Nordt and Jacob ! 995:169-174). As is the case with the Trinity River location and others on upper Galveston Bay (Paine
1987), the Pleistocene surface at Gaulding was prominently
gullied (Figures 5 and 6). Gaulding is situated on the edge of
the late glacial incised Taylor Bayou valley that at one time
(probably 15 to 18 thousand years ago) was entrenched to a
depth of more than 30 m (Kane 1959:228). It seems virtually
certain that valley margin gully erosion would have been
underway from that time. The Gaulding stratigraphic profiles suggest that the paleosolâs A-horizon, while not present
everywhere, was present on the high parts of some of the
irregular Pleistocene topography (cf. Figures 5 and 6). This
indicates that gullying continued after soil formation, possibly during the Middle Holocene as suggested by Nordt and
Jacob (1995:173-174).
Over time the archeological shell deposit accumulated
to a thickness of more than a meter. By then the shell ridge
had begun to act as a barrier to down-slope movement of
sediment eroded from the slightly higher, nearby uplands of
French Island; this accumulation on the land-side of the
shell deposit also is seen in cross-section in Figure 5. Along
the south, or bayou, side of the site, there is a colluvial
deposit of rotted shell fragments and black clay. The geometry of the colluvium is only approximate but it suggests
there may have been erosion directly against this face of the
shell deposit at one time. A thin mantle of peat overlies the
colluvial deposit. The black clay in both these deposits is
similar and may have originated either fiâom overbank flood
deposits combined with decayed organic material, from marsh
formation on the bayou side, or as an erosion product derived from the thick, black matrix of the uppermost layer of
the archeological site. Although only shown here on the AAâ cross-section, a similar profile was documented in 1995
on a line south of Test Pit C- 1 (Figure 4). There the colluvium
was offlapped by a nearly 1 ft (30 cm) thick deposit of black
clay. The peat shown at the south end of cross-section A-Aâ
(i.e., grid east) covered both the clay and colluvium (Figure
5). Today the base of the archeological shell deposit is approximately at bayou water level.
It also may be asked whether there are other archeological remains that are embedded in the post-Pleistocene sediments beyond the periphery of the large shell mass. This
possibility was raised on the upper Texas coast some 25
years ago (Hole 1974:8-9) but has rarely been pursued even
though there are indications that such remains often occur.
At the Fullen site, located near Clear Lake in Harris County,
surface stripping around the main shell deposit identified
small clusters of shell, artifacts, and possible structural re-

mains (OâBfien 1974:49-50, Figure 7). The Lido Harbor site is
the only other large-scale stripping done around the periphery of a concentrated shell deposit (Weinstein 1991). Some
other investigators also have recovered evidence that low
density archeological remains, with and without shell, can
be found near shell-bearing sites (e.g., Aten et al 1976:7-10,
46-47; Aten 1983a:7-18). These may be little more than small
hearth/refuse pile couplets formed during dry periods when
either the superior drainage qualities of the shel! mound or
the superior heat retention qualities of previously deposited
shell were not needed. Whatever they are, their nature is
only slightly known. More of them need to be exposed and
investigated to understand better the range of activities at
Sabine Lake area shell-bearing sites.
In any event, in 1965 a small amount of Rangia cuneata
shell and some sherds were seen scattered at the surface of
a pimple mound a short distance downstream along the
bayou from the Gaulding site shel! mound. The notes do not
record the specific location but it was approximately 30 to 50
m downstream. This location was designated Area D (Figure
4) and a profile 12-ft (3.6 m) long and 2-ft (.6 m) deep was
cleared across the highest part of the pimple mound. The
profile exposed a brown, fine sandy loam layer extending to
1.5 ft (.45 m) below the surface. A light tan very fine sandy
loam underlay this to a depth of 22 inches (.56 m). This, in
turn, was underlain by mottled reddish-yellow clay. Rangia
shells were scattered through the brown loam section but
mostly in the top 6 inches (. 15 m); none were found in the tan
loam and reddish-yellow clay subsoil. No excavation was
undertaken to attempt to clear and describe any buried archeological features iu Area D, but the limited information
available resembles the sparse peripheral remains reported
from other sites.
Finally, there is a peculiarity about the Gaulding siteâs
setting that cannot be explained at this time; namely, the
orientation of the site with respect to Taylor Bayou. Archeological shell deposits of the northern Gulf coast generally are oriented with their long axis parallel to their adjacent water-body or to the primary geomorphic feature on
which they rest, such as bayfront, lakefront, stream channel, or beach ridge. The Gaulding site, however, is oriented
about 35Â° fiâom Taylor Bayou with only its eastern end
impinging directly on the bayou. Aerial photographs of the
bayou taken in 1938, prior to channel straightening in the
1950âs, show a prominent lineation near to the stream-side
of the site which might suggest an early channel position
different from the present one. However, even this feature
is 17Â° away from being parallel to the long axis of the site.
The lineation can be located on the ground and marks a
slightly lower surface elevation on the side towards the
stream. A limited amount of probing across this linear feature with the soil augur indicated Beaumont Formation deposits continued on both sides; there was no indication of
buried Holocene stream channel deposits that might explain the siteâs orientation.

SITE STRUCTURE
To display the internal structure of the shell site, the
field profiles drawn at many of the exposed stratigraphic
sections in the 1965 excavation units were combined into
two more or less continuous cross-sections, B-Bâ and C-Câ
(Figure 6). To further examine some of the individual layers
and deposits for diagnostic contents and possible forma-

tional signatures, a part of the Gaulding site was re-sampled
in 1995. There were several reasons for doing this.
1.
Since numerous individuals had participated in the 1965
stratigraphic profile evaluation and recording, the results, while broadly consistent, were not always identical in detail. For example, the N300/W100 intersection
of walls in test A- 1 (Figure 6) does not exactly match,
and there are other minor inconsistencies. Because of

4.

this, it seemed desirable to re-examine a previously documented profile in the site.
Since most of the archeological site was preceramic,
with deposits containing practically no diagnostic artifacts, obtaining samples suitable for radiocarbon dating was essential to documenting the siteâs formation.
Since investigating paleoenvironments and the siteâs
formation was intended, collecting a uniform series of
bulk samples from the stratigraphic layers would permit
detailed analysis of archeological sediments.
As an experiment, undisturbed core samples of the archeological deposit were taken that were hardened with
epoxy and kept as a permanent record of the siteâs stratification and to make thin sections also as part of the
study of site formation.

As mentioned earlier, it was possible to relocate and reopen part of the original B- I test pit (Figure 4), and perform
the data and sample collecting just described. The re-documented stratification and the radiocarbon dating will be discussed here, while the bulk sample and core/thin-section
analyses will be presented in the "Archeological Sediments"
section.
Stratigraphy
The newly exposed and re-documented west wall of
test pit B- 1 (Figure 7) correlated well with the 1965 documentation. Although recorded in somewhat morn detail, the strata
recognized in 1995 could be matched easily with the earlier
work which gave confidence that, on the whole, the 1965
profiles represented the internal structure of the Gaulding
site. The consolidated descriptions of the 1965 "zones" are
compared to the descriptions of the 1995 "layers" in Figure
8.
Unlike the present ground surface, the pre-site surface
is quite irregular (Figure 6). The 1965 lithologic descriptions
mainly distinguished the bedrock clay (Beaumont Formation) as blue or brown clay, and yellowish clay. These terms
probably refer to the Wallisville Paleosol, and to its underlying subsoil, respectively; and so they are labeled this way
on the cross-sections. The interrupted continuity of the
Wallisville Paleosol may indicate that erosion continued up
until the time that the site began to form.
The initial archeological layers, though mostly filling
the low places of the apparently gullied Pleistocene surface,
were horizontally extensive and more or less homogeneous
sheets with abundant matrix binding the shells. Many layers
and deposits of irregular geometry, particularly near the site
margins, and containing very little matrix, succeeded the
initial shell layers. Then, the entire site was blanketed with a
thick layer of heavily matrix-bound shells, that filled in remaining topographic irregularities and culminated in a relatively smooth ground surface. Each of these three units is
bounded by a significant depositional hiatus (Figure 8). This
also may be true between individual layers and deposits but
physical evidence for such hiatuses was not discovered.
A similar three-part aggradational structure has been
observed at lowland shell mounds excavated in the Trinity
River delta (Ambler 1973). It is a sequence of matrix-bound,
horizontal layers at the top and the bottom of a site, intervened by a sequence of less continuous deposits, often
without matrix, that dip steeply down the sides and ends of
the mound. The middle of the sequence is the most complex
and has many of the thin, fragmented shell deposits that
grade into the thicker, whole shell deposits often on the side
slopes of the mound. While these middle units might be
accounted for by accumulation models developed by Aten
(1983a: 84- 88) and Nodine (1987:19-26), the upper and lower
units of horizontal layers remain to be explained.
Finally, the ground surface over the shell deposit today
is a !ow, smooth ridge with a maximum of .6 m relief on the

landward side and about 1 ~Â¼ m on the bayou side (Figure 4).
While the shell ridge is roughly elliptical and at one end
impinges directly on the bayou, the surface contours describing the smooth, low ridge over the site bend downstream (to the north) paralleling the bayou without any corresponding change in the underlying shell deposit. This
suggests that the surface sediment accumulation over the
ridge is at least partly of non-cultural, hydrological origin.
Radiocarbon Dates
The relationship between physical stratigraphy and radiocarbon dates from the 1995 sampling at B-1 (west) make it
possible to identify the age of deposition at Gaulding, at
least in the excavations reported here. From this a scheme
can be developed for grouping layers, levels, and zones into
a common fiâamework for analyzing the artifacts, faunal remains, and other data while minimizing confusion from
miscorrelation of strata between excavation units. Although
all ten archeological layers in B- 1 (west) were sampled for
radiocarbon purposes, only seven were measured. The locations of those seven radiocarbon samples are shown on
the stratigraphic profile of the B-1 (west) excavation (Figure
7). The calibrated dates are listed in Table 1, and are p!otted
along with culture chronologies from nearby areas in Figure
9. An explanation of the calibration computations is given in
Appendix C.
The seven radiocarbon and two diagnostic ceramic
dates from Gaulding indicate three periods of habitation and
accumulation of archeological deposits. The earliest group,
whose average date is between roughly 3700 and 4000 cal
B.R, dates Layers 2 and 4, and brackets Layer 3. Layer 5 is
included with these also because bulk sample evidence to
be described below shows a discontinuity in several attributes between Layers 5 and 6. The middle period of accumulation includes two groups of statistically identical
samples whose average dates are very close and range between roughly 2700 and 3000 cal B.R These samples directly
date Layers 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 (lower). While the intercepts of
these dates are not always in chronological ordm; they are
all close and their second standard deviation ranges all substantially overlap.
In addition, there are distinctive ceramics from the upper part of Layer 10 (Zone A in 1965 terminology) also shown
on Figure 9. The uppermost arbitrary level in the 1965 and
1974 excavations included nearly all of the cermnics. Included
in the collection were several sherds of Tchefuncte culture
ceramics datable to the late 1 ~ millennium B.C., along with
several sherds from a single Caddoan vessel that would
date to approximately A.D. 1300 (Dee Ann Story, personal
communication, 1998).
These datable materials all describe a clear, three-part
sequence for understanding the stratigraphy in the B-1 (west)
profile. Layers 2 through 5 are sandwiched between depositional hiatuses, as are Layers 6 through 9. Layer 10 is the
final accumulation at the site, much of it apparently non-

10, or whether the lower part of Layer 10 includes shells
disrupted from the underlying shell mound surface of Layers 7, 8, and 9. Layer 10 is probably the most unmistakable
stratum at Gaulding; it is thick, it blankets the entire site, and
it is lithologically and visually distinctive. At this time, it
looks as if Layer 10 represents very gradual depositional
conditions and that the shells in the lower part of Layer 10
include some from the underlying mound surface.
Finally, as important as it is to recognize the periods of
archeological accumulation, it is equally important to note
that the hiatuses in the site represent at least three-fourths
of the time elapsed since the earliest occupation circa 4,000
years ago.
Stratigraphic Analysis Units
Inspection of cross-sections B-Bâ and C-Câ (Figure 6)
shows that correlation of some strata is straightforward, while
others are speculative. Nevertheless the correlation between
the two datasets is fairly clear (Figure 8). The 1965 zonal
terminology was conâelated throughout the 1965 profiles (Figure 6) not long after the field school excavation by C. N.
Bollich and it seems best to adopt that interpretation coming
as it did while the excavation was still fresh in mind. Generally it is consistent and reasonable, although there are sections, as in the south wall of Test Pits A-1 and A-2, which
cannot be clarified without re-opening the site.
Arbitrary levels at times, and depositional strata, or layers, at other times were used to control the 1965 excavation.
Because there were relatively few specimens recovered, and
because of the difficulty in correlating the different kinds of
excavation units, a "lumping" rather than a "splitting" approach was taken. For culture-historical purposes, the site
was chronologically subdivided into three parts, or stratigraphic analysis units - upper, middle, and lower - based
on the three distinctive and well-dated periods of archeological accumulation described above. Rather than attempt
to use individual layers and zones for site-wide analysis,
this three-part scheme could be extrapolated through the
1965 excavation units with a minimum of confusion or debate, although there are places where an "educated =uess
had to be made. The estimated correlation of analysis units
with excavation units is shown in Appendix D. Lest there be
any confusion due to the previously described three-part
model of archeological sedimentation (i.e., matrix-bound top
and bottom with complex middle section), and the three-part
chronostratigraphy of the analysis units just described, these
are two distinct and probably unrelated analytical devices.
Thickness and Depocenters
Because the 1965 field school excavations included
numerous small test holes dug with shovels and post-hole
diggers, it has been possible to reconstruct the limits and
thickness of the shell deposit in some detail. With this infor-

23

mation, lateral shifts in the centers of shell deposition can be
noted, a feature not as evident on conventional stratigraphic
cross-sections. The thickness map (Figure 10) shows several thick and thin irregularities in the overall deposit but
with the greatest site mass genera!ly in its center. In the
same figure, a thickness cross-section along the W100 line
is presented in which the thickness measurements are plotted downward from the ground surface. This direction was
used, rather than making the bottom of the deposit the zero
line because it is known the surface is relatively smooth and
that the base is irregular.
The stratigraphic analysis units (A.U.âs) are identified
on the thickness cross-section (Figure 10) and they give an
indication of shifting depositional centers during the siteâs
history. The lower shell deposits fill the original irregularities of the gullied Middle Holocene land surface from near
N130/W100 eastward to N330/W100 near the bayou. The
earliest deposits (i.e., the Lower A.U.) are midway along the
length of the site primarily between excavation units B-1 and
C- 1. The principal accumulation during the Middle Analysis
Unit shifted noticeably to the west and from N80/W100 to
about N200AV100. The principal deposition of the Upper
A.U. was at the eastern end of the site from N200/W100 to
N330/W100, but extended westward well past the limit of the
Lower and Middle analytical units. Later, evidence presented
on the distribution of ceramics wil! confirm this eastern end
as the focal area for cultural deposition in the Upper Analysis Unit. Nevertheless, the dark, loamy sediment of this layer
may blanket the entire site and beyond, giving rise to the
downstream bend in the topographic ridge on top of the site
(Figure 4) and possibly extending even farther downstream
to form the upper loam with incorporated Rangia shells at
the pimple mound in Area D.
To conclude this section on site structure, there are
several aspects of the geometry of the Gaulding site that
seem unusual:
1. The prominent air photo lineation south of the shell
mound to which the moundâs overall elongate form appears to be oriented rather than to the present course of
Taylor Bayou;
2. The evidence of a period of erosion directly against the
south (i.e., grid east) side of the shell mound sometime
after the formation of the Middle Analysis Unit; the
black clay matrix of the colluvium suggests that the
accumulating eroded shell fragments were washing
down into marsh or lacustrine deposits and not into a
flowing stream like Taylor Bayou. The overlapping of
the colluvial shell by first a thick black clay and then a
peat, both without shell, indicates that low energy marsh
formation conditions continued for some time;
3. The principal depocenters for the Lower and Middle
Analysis Units were in the center and western end of
the shell ridge and not adjacent to Taylor Bayou. While
the Upper Analysis Unit (Layer 10) covers the entire
site and beyond, the archeo!ogical portion of the unit is

near the bayou.
At the same time, the hydrological impact of Taylor
Bayou on the Upper Analysis Unit (Layer 10) is evident
in the downstream trending surface contours seen on
the siteâs topographic map. Because there is not a levee
ridge all along the bayou, the downstream-deflected
contours may not be deposits from overbank flooding.

Rather, they may be Layer 10 (Upper A.U.) materials
reworked and displaced downstream during bayou flood
periods.
The Gaulding site stratigraphy apparently conforms to
the three-part aggradational model of shell deposits
containing little binding matrix sandwiched between
horizontal, matrix-bound shell deposits above and below. While the formation of the middle deposits may

Chapter 2: Site Formation

conform to models that have been proposed, the origin
of the upper and lower layers is not clear.
ARCHEOLOGICAL SEDIMENTS
The previously described physical and chronological
stratigraphies make it possible to recognize the succession
of differently composed strata, and how the archeological
shell mass correlates with the surrounding landscape. The
visual distinctiveness of the Gaulding site strata is owed to
variations in the composition of matrix and shells in each
layer. To examine these differences more carefully, eleven
bulk samples were taken in 1995 from the newly exposed B1 (west) profile (Figure 11). The procedure used for analyzing the samples is described in Appendix B, part 4. While
analyzing bulk samples gives a much more refined view of
the contents of the stratigraphic layers and indicates specific successional differences, it must be admitted at the
outset that only one sample from each layer provides no
basis for evaluating the two-dimensional range of activities
that created a layer. To study within-layer settlement patterns, an array of similar samples would be needed. But, that
is a problem to address in a future investigation. Despite
this limitation, the bulk samples yielded much interesting
evidence.
As a complement to the bulk samples, two 24-inch (.6 m)
cores were taken (Figure 11), for use as a permanent stratigraphic reference (see Appendix B, part 5). Since the cores
were taken immediately adjacent to the B-1 (west) profile
that was recorded in detail, the reference halves of the cores
were correlated with the profile and then examined for features that would augment the lithologic descriptions (Appendix B, part 3). However, because of the similarity of the
outcrop profile and cores, the latter were not independently
described. Thin sections also were made from the other half
of the split cores and were scanned under a petrographic
microscope by Paul Goldberg (Boston University) for this
project. While not a detailed study, those preliminary findings are included at appropriate places in the following discussion.

Grain size analysis
The first stage in analyzing the bulk samples was to
divide them into size fractions to facilitate comparisons (Figure 12). Using Layer 1 (i.e., the Beaumont Formation) as a
baseline for the sediment most likely to be incorporated into
the archeological site from higher topographic surfaces
nearby, it is apparent that all of the samples, perhaps excepting Layer 10 (lower), are similar except for the archeological
shell they contain. That is, except for shell and other archeological materials mostly held in the 2~)and larger screens,
very little geological sediment is larger than 3~ (. 125 mm).
The next notable feature of the sieved samples is that
grouped together in the middle of Figure 12 are the samples
from Layers 2 and 10 (lower) followed a little higher up by
the samples from Layers 3 and 10 (upper). These four

25

samples comprise, at Gaulding, the manifestation of the
lower and upper horizontal matrix-rich units that were described as part of the three-part aggradational model in the
"Site Structure" section. The grain-size curves show that
these bounding layers differ from the middle deposit in
two respects: 1) they have a larger proportion of matrix;
and 2) their mean grain sizes coarsen upwards. That is,
Layer 2 has more matrix material than Layer 3, and likewise,
Layer 10 (lower) has more matrix material than Layer 10
(upper). The grain-size curves also show that all other layers - those comprising the middle section of the B- 1 (west)
profile - clustered together at the top of the graph. This
means these layers are all similar in their grain sizes, and
that they have much less matrix than do Layers 2 to 3, and
10 (lower) to 10 (upper).
The grain-size curves confirm, up to a point, the visual
impression of differences between layers seen and described
at the B-1 (west) outcrop. They go beyond the outcrop descriptions in showing quantitatively that: 1) bottom and top
layers are initially finer grained but lose matrix as they accumulate; and 2) that all the other layers are more or less similar
to each other in their material sizes. From the standpoint of
grain sizes alone, the only difference between any of the
samples is in the addition of archeological materials, and in
the degree of fineness of their size. In this way, the grain-size
curves suggest that different activities or processes created
the upper and lower layers versus creation of the middle
layers. The middle layers all represent accumulation/reduction processes (i.e., habitation activities) that produce similar grain sizes, while the upper and lower zones may represent or be the result of something different.
Grain-size sieving of the bulk samples also makes it possible to look at the classification of archeological sediments
in alternative but somewhat objective ways. Visual inspection of the fractions from all the samples with a binocular
microscope at 10x and 20x indicates that materials larger than
3~)(. 125 mm) are almost entirely related to the archeological
use of the location, i.e., shell, bone, charcoal, etc. Moreover,
materials retained in the-3.65~ (larger than 12.5 mm) are
whole shells and very large shell fragments with only an
occasional bone or artifact. The -2~)(4 mm) to 3~)(. 125 mm)
fractions are largely shell fragments, but include bone and a
host of other materials related to the archeological occupation. Materials that are 4~(.062 mm) or smaller (i.e., very finegrained sand, silt, and clay) are almost exclusively clastic
sediments derived from various nearby facies of the Beaumont Formation. The fine-grained (3~) or. 125 mm) fraction in
some bulk samples have substantial amounts of natural sediments, but in all cases a majority proportion is archeological.
This latter size class is the pivot point between natural and
cultura! sediments in the layers.
Given these size-material relationships, it is possible to
take a "cultural" view and a "sedimentary" view of the grainsize data and classify the layers in slightly different ways.
The "cultural" view emphasizes the formative processes lead-

ing to hearth/refuse pile couplets (Aten 1983a) that may be
what formed deposits in the middle layers at Gaulding. This
approach visualizes deposits as a relationship between whole
shell (and large fragments), fragmented shell (and other small
archeological materials), and a natural sedimentary matrix.
Plotting the weight percent values (Table 13) for each layer
as a three-pole plot (Figure 13a) highlights more subtle differences between samples than is obvious in the cumulative
grain size plots (Figure 12). For instance, none of the B-1
(west) bulk samples truly qualifies as "whole" or "fragmented" shell as is often used to label strata in field descriptions. At the same time, none of the samples truly qualifies
as predominantly sedimentary, even those with the interstitial spaces filled with sediment. All of the Gaulding samples
are significantly intermediate even though they are distinguishably different when viewed at the outcrop. In particu-

lar, and unlike the cumulative grain size plot, the three-pole
plot identifies Layer 5 and possibly Layer 8 as different from
the rest of the middle layers. The remainder of the groupings
is similar to those in Figure 12.
The "sedimentary" view of the bulk samples looks at
them in the often used "gravel-sand-mud" fiâamework of sedimentation studies, although in this case the term "shell" is
substituted for gravel (Figure 13b). Quantitative characterization of the three-part aggradation model (i.e., upper and
lower matrix-rich zones encasing a middle, structurally complex, matrix-poor zone) is clearest in this plot. The coarsening upward pattern of the upper and lower zones is reasonably clear also. And overall, it is again clear that all of the
archeological layers have proportionally little natural sediment. The respective descriptive classifications from all of
these analyses are compared in Figure 8.

Chapter 2: Site Formation

Composition
As previously noted, the Gaulding bulk samples consisted of large objects (nearly all Rangia cuneata shells)
forming the structura! framework of a layer, and small objects (consisting of both archeological and geological materials) that filled the interstitial spaces. The large objects reflect several manufacturing and use activities and may or
may not have been found in their primary discard location.
Data on the large materials was obtained from the -2~(4 mm)
and larger screen fractions, and included the number, size,
and condition primarily of shells, bones, and some artifacts
(Table 14). This material signifies either the locations of fire
hearths, food preparation areas, and/or tool manufacture or
maintenance. They also may indicate agglomerations of such
materials that were cleared from living areas and placed in
midden areas.
The small objects are equally complex and indicate various cultural activities, elements of the site environment, or
post-deposition alteration of the siteâs materials. They are
much too small to be gathered up and moved, and probably
were found where they initially formed or were discarded.
Conceivably, certain of these components may constitute
an activity "signature." The 1 ~ (.5 mm) fraction was selected
for point-counting because the particles were large enough
to be identified and counted under a 10x to 20x binocular
microscope, while probably being small enough to be unaffected by any site clean-up behavior. All of the point counts
are recorded in Table 15. Those results also are divided in
Table 16 into habitation-related and post-deposition material, with separately computed percentages for a different
perspective on the data. Finally, in addition to the sieved
and counted data, pH was measured on matrix before sieving, and tenâestrial snails were floated from each bulk sample
before it was water-sieved.
The ratio of whole shells to fragmented shells (Figure
14a) suggests the relative extent of layer formation attributable to use as hearth/living areas (i.e., relatively more fragmented shells) versus using them as disposal areas (i.e.,
relatively more whole shells). Layer 2 stands out strongly as
containing whole shells with very little fragmentary material.
Even Layers 4 and 7 that were given field names of "whole
shell" (Figure 11) contained enough fragmentary shell to
have a low whole-to-fragmented-shell ratio. The only prehistoric means to create an abundance of fragmented shell
from sound, whole Rangia shells is through the application
of heat, and apparently Layer 2 simply did not have any or
many fire hearths, at least in this part of the site. This interpretation is further supported by the paucity of burned shell
described below.
The ratio of shell to sand/silt/clay matrix may suggest
the degree of overbank flooding, slope wash down into the
site or, conceivably, extended submersion of the site. The
plot of this ratio (Figure 14b) affirms the conclusions discussed earlier that there is a clear, quantitative difference
between the bottom and top layers versus the middle layers.

29

Matrix is scarce in the middle layers, at least relative to the
amounts found in the upper and lower bounding layers. The
question remains whether a relationship exists between the
three-part aggradational model and the obviously cultural
activities that reduced whole Rangia shells to a fragmentary
state. To examine this, a scatter plot was prepared of the two
indexes (i.e., shell: matrix and whole: fragmental27). This indicated no correlated changes or trends between them. The
lack of any apparent relationship may indicate that the threepart aggradational model is due to natural rather than cultural causes.
The material comprising the layers is nearly all shell but
the larger bone fragments were counted since they are moderately numerous in the -2~) and larger fractions (Table 14).
Since counts rather than proportions were used, however,
the data recorded in Table 14 were normalized to the bulk
sample size of Layer 10 (upper). The amount of bone in all
layers below the Upper Analysis Unit was small (Figure 14c)
but the frequency increased significantly in Layer 5 and
again in Layer 10. Comparing the large bone sample to that
from point-counting the 1 ~)matrix fraction (Figure 14d), the
bone proportion from the small fraction partially reflects that
seen in the larger fraction by significantly increasing in Layer
10 but not in Layer 5. This may indicate either a different
manner or kind of food preparation, or different refuse disposal in the two layers. Charcoal is consistently present in
very small quantities throughout all layers except Layer 2
where it is absent. However, inspection of the sieve fractions smaller than 1~ reveals charcoal as much more abundant. Fire fuels in the coastal marshes are easily consumed
materials like twigs, small shrubs, cane, and the like. Large
charcoal fragments generally are not found and that is confirmed here again by the contents of the sieve fractions.
Charcoal particles this small (<.5 mm) probably are easily
wind-blown over a larger area than their source. It may not
be a good activity signature unless it is found in large quantities, or is notable by its absence. At Gaulding, the absence
of charcoa! in the 1 ~ fraction of Layer 2 is another indicator
that it differs from the other layers. Since smaller size fractions were not counted, some caution is in order, but the
basic conclusion of no use of fire in this part of Layer 2
seems sound.
Burned and unburned R. cuneata shell fragments are
plotted in Figure 14d also. Confirming the previous indication that formation of Layer 2 in the B- 1 (west) area of the
site did not include much use of fire hearths, the proportion
of unburned shell is high and of burned shell is extremely
low. In the succeeding Layers 3 through 9, burned and unburned shell fluctuates from layer to layer in generally similar percentages. However, when Layer 10 begins, the quantity of both kinds of shell is reduced below the proportion of
bone fragments.
Usually it is the case that the number of right and left
Rangia cuneata valves is about equal in samples from discrete contexts or of any moderate to large size (Aten 1983a: 13;

Weinstein 1991:173-175), although this may not be the case
with Rangia in certain natural environments (Claassen
1998:74). In clam cooking experiments, it was observed that
the right and left valves usually do not separate at the hinge
unless heated excessively, in which event the shell is shattered and the meat is dried or charred (Aten, unpublished
notes). So the expected situation in primary Rangia shel!
disposal contexts is approximately equal numbers of valves
from both sides. For this reason, the ratio of right to left
valves was compared for each layer (Figure 15a). Again,
Layer 2 is distinguished from the other layers by having an
abnormally large number of, in this case, left valves over
rights. If Sabine Lake area prehistoric campsites that were
inhabited for extended periods - say for weeks - were subject to periodic cleanup, this would result in secondary deposits, as are known from some contemporary shellfish gatherers (e.g., Meehan 1982). But whether such secondary deposits would be likely to have such a valve imbalance is
unknown.
The maximum shell length was measured for all whole R.
cuneata valves of whichever side had the largest number of
specimens. From these data, both growth cohort histograms
were plotted and shell length descriptive statistics were computed (Table 14). The growth histograms will be used later,
but at this point the mean shell length is plotted as an indicator of the size of the clam population being exploited (Figure
15b). A distinct difference exists between the small clams
harvested during the Lower Analysis Unit, and the larger
ones harvested in the later units. This may have environmental implications and will be discussed again later. The
question also arises whether the product of number of clams
and the estimated meat weight represented by the mean shell
length for each layer (Table 14) indicates a difference in
amounts of shellfish meat harvested. These data were normalized to the bulk sample dry weight of the Layer 10 upper
sample to facilitate comparison. The results indicate that
most layers represent similar amounts of shellfish meat perhaps excepting Layer 7, which has a greater amount.
The habitation-related composition characteristics just
described provide further refinements on the nature of the
layers and their differences. They reaffirm the three-part
aggradational model of matrix-rich upper and lower layers
bounding the matrix-poor intermediate layers. But, while the
upper and lower zones are superficially similar and matrixrich, they are, nevertheless, quite different. Layer 2 is unlike
any other layer in the site, with a large proportion of whole
shells, abundant sedimentary matrix, an overall grain size
distribution that is strongly bimodal, a striking paucity of
evidence for using fire, and an unusual mismatch in the number of right and left clam valves. Layer 3 also is part of the
lower zone but its only characteristic is the abundant fine
matrix; otherwise it is similar to the contents of the middle
layers. This may suggest that the reason for the excessive
fine matrix is unrelated to the cause of all the other unusual,
but habitation-related, features of Layer 2.

31

Layer 10, on the other hand, shares only the attribute of
abundant sedimentary matrix with Layers 2 and 3. The greatest difference between Layer 10 and all the other layers is its
much higher incidence of finely comminuted bone fragments
and whole bones of very small animals. When subsistence
evidence is discussed later, differences will be evident in the
focus of subsistence between layers. Although the large
fractions of the Layer 10 samples contained more bone fragments than earlier layers, there was no accumulation of fragmented large mammal bone as would be the case, say, where
bone grease was being produced. Rather the small fractions
are notable for the often whole bones of very small animals
that must have been eaten essentially whole and the results
of that consumption were being accumulated in the area of
Layer 10 that was sampled.
The intermediate layers - 4 through 9 - and to some
extent Layer 3 as well, have a substantial mixture of whole
and fragmented shell, a fluctuating but substantial mix of
burned and unburned shell, little fine matrix, very little bone
or charcoal refuse, and more nearly matched right and left
clam valves. It may be notable that in Layer 5 the bone fragments increased in the large fraction but did not increase in
the matrix.
The indicators just described are primarily oriented to
the cultural formation and use of the siteâs layers. The data
set to be described next seems to relate to post-depositional
modifications of the archeological sediments. At the outcrop it was noticed that Rangia valves that were horizontal
and concave-upward often were encrusted on their interior
surface with redeposited calcium carbonate. This was a sign
of clam shells being actively leached at higher elevations
and the mineral being precipitated again at lower elevations.
The number of shells with carbonate crusts was recorded in
the -2~) and larger samples (Table 14) and the percent of
such shells was plotted (Figure 15c). In general the frequency
of encrustation increases with depth but it is especially prominent in Layers 2 and 7, and especially deficient in Layer 10.
The significant accumulation of carbonate crusts in Layer 2
likely is due to the ponding and evaporation of rain water at
the top of the relatively impermeable Beaumont Formation.
The more modest increase in Layer 7 may also reflect somewhat less permeability through the underlying Layer 6, which
has some fine matrix. A similar pattern was obtained from the
!~) matrix sample that was point-counted (Tables 15 and 16).
Measurements ofpH were made on matrix from all bulk
samples (Table 14; Figure 15d). As would be expected, given
the downward mobility of dissolved calcium carbonate, the
pH steadily increases (i.e., becomes more alkaline) downward with an apparent stair-step pattern tied to the three
stratigraphic analysis units. In this case, the pH pattern suggests that Layer 6 might be part of the lower stratigraphic
analysis unit, despite other evidence to the contrary.
The matrix samples often contained small (circa 1 mm or
less in diameter) iron concretions that are presumed to form
under repeated wetting and drying conditions. These were

recorded as part of the point counting (Tables 15 and 16)
and when plotted (Figure 16a) show a clear stair-step pattern closely following the interpreted stratigraphic analysis
unit sequence. Presumably there are more such concretions
in the lower and older deposits and particularly in Layer 2
because of its dense matrix. Although not point-counted,
there also is an abundance of iron concretions in Layer 1
underlying the site.
The 10 matrix samples often contained vegetal fragments, usually rootlets. Although the majority of vegetal
materials were floated out of the sample before sieving, the
remainder were point-counted just to see what would develop (Tables 15 and 16; Figure 16b). As it turns out, distinct
peaks of vegetal fragments occurred in Layers 3, 8, and 10
(upper). These locations each are 10-20 cm below the former
and the current ground surfaces at the site. Presumably the
vegetal fragment plot also supports the three interpreted
stratigraphic analysis units.
In the higher layers it was common in the point-counting to encounter small (ca..5 mm), often cylindrical, indurated, dark gray clay and silt pellets that appear to be worm
casts; these were abundant especially in the lower part of
Layer 10 (Tables 15 and 16; Figure 16c). These pellets rapidly diminished with depth. Aside from confirming a sharp
depositional break between Layers 9 and 10, they indicate
that, unlike solutes, it was rare for even small particles to
migrate downward through the deposit.
When the bulk samples were soaked before sieving, a
sizable collection of terrestrial snails was floated to the surface (Table 14). A report on these samples is included (Appendix F) and their environmental implications are discussed
later. However, the number of individuals recovered by layer
is noted and plotted after being normalized to the size of the
Layer 10 (upper) sample (Table 14; Figure 16d). Their paucity in Layers 2, 3, and 10 may be related to the matrix-rich
character of these layers and perhaps indicates that when
these layers were formed they were wet frequently, or perhaps even submerged, and were environments inimical to
terrestrial snails. Clearly this was not the case during the
middle stratigraphic analysis unit. Just what was the immediate site environment in the time of Layers 4 and 5 is not
clear; perhaps it was like conditions during Layers 2 and 3,
but not quite as extreme. In any event, the pattern of terrestrial snail occurrence also reinforces the interpretation of
upper, middle and lower stratigraphic analysis units. In addition, fragments of broken snail shells were recorded in the
point-counting of the 10 matrix fraction (Tables 15 and 16)
and these also yielded a frequency distribution that paralleled that of the floated samples.
Bulk samples from the 1965 excavations as well as the
large and small fractions of the 1995 sieved samples also
contained occasional fragments of unidentified oysters and
mussels (Tables 14, 15, and 16). Based on recovery of more
complete specimens from the excavated levels, these probably were Crassostrea virginica and its commensal mussel

33

Brachidontes spp. Very likely the mussel was collected incidental to collecting the oyster. The provenience data are too
imprecise to interpret whether these shellfish are confined
to only certain layers. However, it is clear that both species
were present in each of the three stratigraphic analysis units.
The presence of oysters in the site matrix has important
paleoenvironmental significance. In the mid-20t~ century,
single and clumped oysters were found scattered about the
southern one-third of Sabine Lake (Kane 1961; White et al.,
! 987). Current geological investigations indicate this confinement to the lower lake appears to have characterized the
past 4,000 years except for one brief time (Anderson et al.
1991) when they may have spread farther into the interior of
this estuarine system. However, finding oysters during all
three chronostratigraphic analysis units suggests that either there have been more marine water influxes that have
gone unrecognized, or that Gaulding inhabitants traveled
the 25 km downstream to harvest oysters from Sabine Lake.
This and several other observations made about the estuarine shells (Table 9) will be discussed later in conjunction
with the Taylor Bayou paleoenvironment.
Before concluding this section on the composition of
the several layers at Gaulding, there are a few additional
comments that can be made as a result of inspecting the
thin-sections (R Goldberg, personal communication, 1999),
cores, and from the outcrop layer descriptions. On the basis
of what has been described so far there is a temptation to
see the mataâix of Layer 2 as similar or identical to Layer 1 and
that perhaps the shells were intruded into the top 10 cm or
so of Layer 1. This may or may not be the case. From inspecting the thin-sections under reflected and transmitted
light, it is clear that at the boundary between Layers 1 and 2
there is an abrupt reduction in the abundance of iron concretions in Layer 2, and an abrupt increase in relative proportion of silt in the matrix. And the gleyed condition of
Layer 1 is not developed in Layer 2. Thus, despite the general similarity of color and appearance of the matrix, these
two layers are texturally distinct. However, the pedological
description of Layer 1, as the Morey Silt Loam, notes that
the uppermost part of that soilâs profile is generally a silt
loam underlain by clay or silty clay loam (Crout 1965:12, 62).
This may be what the Gaulding samples reflect.
Next, it is clear from both the thin-section and the core
that Layer 6 has some brown to grayish brown, fine-grained
clay matrix with some orientation developed indicating the
occurrence of a degree of pedogenesis, as well as some
reworking by earthworms. It may be that the former mound
surface at the top of Layer 5 is actually a little higher than
was observed at the outcrop in the field. A little ambiguity
on this point is evident in some of the compositional characteristics described in the preceding pages, although on the
whole, Layers 5 and 6 are distinct. The thin sections of Layer
10 indicate earthworm casts and that the dark brown matrix
is biologically reworked, presumably by worms.
Finally, it may be significant that in the outcrop descrip-

tions (Appendix B, part 3) it was noted that the clam shell
orientations in Layers 2, 4, and 6 seemed random, as were a
strong majority in Layer 3. But strong majorities of shells in
a!! other layers were horizonta!. Although there have been
some taphonomic studies that included discard orientations
of shell deposits (e.g., Claassen 1991:267), there have been
none on Rangia cuneata and so it is difficult to interpret
this observation. However, it is unmistakable that the manner of disposal in the Lower Analytical Unit is different from
that in the Middle and Upper Analytical Units, further reinforcing the indications that dissimilar formation processes
were responsible for the several stratigraphic layers at B-1
(west).
FORMATION PROCESSES
Whether Gulf coast shell sites actually are archeological, a common question about shell sites in past years, was
raised locally as recently as 1983 in a report on test excavations on nearby Hillebrandt Bayou (Raab and Smith 1983).
They brought up the issue in relation to two shell deposits
dating approximately 2900 calibrated years ago and in which
they observed no unequivocal cultural materials retained in
the 1A inch (6.5 ram) screens. The conclusion that shell
mounds are not archeological usually takes the form that
natural processes caused shell heaps to be established and
that Indian peoples often made campsites on their surface
(e.g., Pearce 1932). Numerous criteria have been put forward
for determining whether a shell deposit is archeological or
natural in origin, some dating back to the mid-19~â century;
recent examples are Anderson and McBride 1996, Bailey et
al. 1994, Boyajian and Thayer 1995, McBride et al. 1997, and
OâConner and Sullivan 1994.
This is not a difficult question on the northern Gulf of
Mexico coast. Natural shell deposit characteristics are either
a function of species biology or of the energy environment
that concentrated them into secondary deposits. Biological
and low energy settings are not relevant to this issue because in such locations the shells remain in stream channel,
lake, bay floor, or beach deposits. They are !ow density and
bear no resemblance to archeological sites. In higher energy
settings, such as the shore of lakes and bays - environments with a long fetch- substantial shell berms do form as
secondary concentrations that in gross size are comparable
to some archeological shell sites. The materials are derived
either from the bay floor, or from shoreline archeological
shell sites that are washed farther inland. The resulting berms
are characterized by significant erosion of the shells, aquatic
vegetation detritus, and sandy, non-organic matrix if there is
any matrix at all. The high-energy wave environment usually
removes most small clastic sediment and particles of habitation origin.
Clearly the Gaulding site is at least partly archeological
because it contains artifacts interbedded with shell materials. However, the remaining evidence for a cultural origin of
the shell accumulation is overwhelming. The site is located

35

adjacent to a confined and very short fetch water body along
which even major cyclonic storms could not create such a
large, discrete, shell mass. There were repeated episodes of
accumulation, centuries apart, but at precisely the same location. There is an absence of excessive wear and edgerounding of the majority of the shells. The presence of burned
shell, extensive preservation of very small bone fragments,
and very lightweight materials such as charcoal, are not conclusive because, so the argument goes, natives camped on
the shell surface, built fires, and so on.
Unfortunately, one of the sites at which Raab and Smith
raised this issue no longer exists, but one remains and analysis of bulk samples there would be an appropriate means for
seeking positive evidence of its origin. But there really are
no locations, in the confines of the Taylor Bayou drainage
basin, where natural processes could create shell deposits
similar in mass to those recorded as archeological sites. There
are, however, instances of shell deposits being created in
historic times that might be confusing, such as now-abandoned shell-paved roads and ferry ramps near the bayou
shoreline. Distinguishing these deposits from prehistoric
ones might fruitfully entail examination of matrix if more obvious evidence was not found. In any event, there is no
reason to think the Gaulding site is anything other than of
entirely archeological origin, although natural processes have
worked on and around the site over the centuries.
While it is certain that the Gaulding deposits are for the
most part archeological, it is far from certain how they formed.
Most archeologists working on the northern Gulf probably
assume that diverse activities are responsible for formation
of shell sites, but there has not been enough work yet directed at deciphering formation evidence (e.g., Aten 1983a;
Gadus and Howard 1990; OâBrien 1974; Weinstein 1991).
Generally it is assumed that the accumulated shell deposits
at Gaulding and similar sites in the northern Gulf coast are
food residues and living surfaces.
Nevertheless, perusal of ethnographic studies reminds
us that there is a variety of other campsite habitation functions that can result in or modify shell deposits (cf., Claassen
1998:2-14). At a minimum there is the single meal period hearth!
refuse pile couplet (Aten 1983a). Associated with selection
of a location for habitation must be areas for voiding, which
is significant because of the concentration of very small
faunal remains that can result. If residency involves extended
periods the campsite could additionally involve areas for
small, temporary structures (OâBrien 1974:49-51), as well as
periodic cleanup of enlarged hearth/refuse pile(s) by collecting and dumping some of the latter in an area selected for
the purpose (cf., Meehan 1982). Depending on the location,
there may also be a need to dig a shallow well, an example of
which may be responsible for Feature 1 at 41CH 16 (Ambler
1973:52-53; Figure 10). Because water usually percolates rapidly through shell deposits, the deposit surface may have
been favored for habitation during wet seasons, while during dry seasons it may not have mattered, thereby account-

36

Test Excavations at the Gaulding Site (41JF27), Jefferson Count3; Texas

ing for many of the peripheral, low-density remains found in
the vicinity of large shell sites. On other occasions when
either a hot fire was needed (e.g., for pottery firing) or when
fire fuels were scarce, it may have been necessary to make
the fire on a shell surface to take advantage of the latterâs
excellent heat retention and radiation qualities (e.g., Aten
1983a:73).
Many campsite organizational patterns are possible. But
the problem becomes much more complex when adding the
element of accumulation through time. Addressing this question by simulating the repeated accumulation of hearths and
refuse piles, Nodine (1987) used the organization of a wel!known ethnographic shellfish gathering camp (Meehan 1982)
as the starting point. The result showed rather convincingly
that the outcome of a large number of repetitions of that
particular pattern of hearth and refuse disposal would concentrate hearths in the central part of the shell deposit while
primary and secondary refuse disposal would be more prominent on the periphery. Translating this into northern Gulf of
Mexico terms, the accumulating site should have an abundance of fragmented shell deposits, many mixed fragmented
and whole shell deposits, and some whole shell deposits in
the central part of the site. Proportionally more whole shell
deposits should be on the periphery of the shell pile. This
idea cannot be rigorously tested with the data at hand, but
inspection of the profiles suggests it might be consistent
with the stratification of the middle portion of the three-part
site aggradational model described earlier.
Another question that only recently is being scrutinized is whether it is reasonable to assume that all shell
refuse is debris from human consumption (Claassen 1998: !0).
Is it reasonable to factor into subsistence and demographic
projections that all these shells reflect a certain amount of
clam meat, and a certain level of nutritional values? One
alternative is for a prehistoric working party to harvest, open,
and dry the clam meat for transport and consumption elsewhere by a demographically different group; there is no relationship between the group responsible for site formation
and the amount of shellfish flesh harvested. Alternatively,
some of the clam meat may have been used for bait to capture certain meat-eating fish or terrestrial-aquatic animals
like alligators. The first use - storage and transport elsewhere - may be possible, but is totally speculative at this
time. The second alternative - non-food production - may
indeed be an important and reasonable factor to consider. At
the present time, it is practically impossible to distinguish
this use, but garfish, turtles, and alligators, among other
terrestrial-aquatic animals were major elements of Gaulding
faunal collections. While there is no ethnohistoric or archeological evidence suggesting these uses, on the other
hand, they have never been sought, either. At the least,
these possible alternative uses of clam meat can remind us
to be cautious about demographic and nutritional predictions.
Given these site formation complexities, what can be

said about the Gaulding site? As was noted earlier, but cannot be overemphasized, the Gaulding samples are very interesting fiâom the perspective of changes through time. However, with only one sieved sample per layer it is not possible
to examine lateral variations within layers which is at the
core of investigating most of the kinds of formational issues
described in the previous pages. Nevertheless, there is a
substautial amount of information from the bulk samples
relating to the formation of the site that can be grouped into
two categories: 1) the effects of local environmental processes on the orientation, geometry, physical appearance
and condition of the site; aud 2) the activities that were the
origin of the archeological sediments and deposits.
Environmental Processes
The orientation of northern Gulf shell sites paralleling
the water body they border is as close to an immutable rule
as can be found, and the Gaulding site appears to seriously
violate it. The long axis of the Gaulding site must have faced
on some presently unrecognized landscape feature. The
shoreline of this feature was rotated some 35Â° from the
present Taylor Bayou shoreline, but is roughly parallel to
the longitudinal axis of the incised Taylor Bayou stream valley. The case for this changed orientation in the earlier Late
Archaic is reinforced by evidence of the shifting depocenters
fi:om the Lower, to the Middle, to the Upper stratigraphic
analysis units. The principal mass of archeological sediments
from the Lower A.U. is roughly in the center of the linear
shell deposit; that of the Middle A.U. is toward the west end
of the deposit (grid south) farthest away from the present
bayou shoreline; and the principal deposit of the Upper A.U.
is at the east end of the site (grid north) immediately adjacent to the present bayou location. The surface topographic
contours over the east end of the shell ridge are deflected
downstream. This suggests that the principal form of the
ridge, largely a clastic sediment blanket over the shell deposit but incorporating some archeological shell, was
achieved in a different depositional environment than exists
today, but that once the bayou was in its present position,
overbank flood currents shaped the surface contours at the
east end of the site. And there was erosion all along the
south side of the shell ridge (grid east) creating a shoreface
with colluvium at its base that is now buried under clay and
peat deposits related to the present flood basin hydrologic
regime.
Probably related to the evolution of the paleo-landscape
is the three-part aggradational model mentioned often in the
preceeding pages. This model describes upper and lower
matrix-rich layers in the shell mound, and a middle that is
matrix poor. As noted earlier, there appears to be no relationship between the shell to matrix ratio when plotted against
the whole to fragmentary shell ratio, and so it seems likely at
Gaulding that neither of the matrix-rich layers is related to
the archeological deposition. The processes underlying
these two characteristics must be independent. The sedi-

Chapter 2: Site Formation

mentary matrix in the lower layers at the site has abundant
silt and fewer iron concretions but otherwise resembles the
underlying Layer 1, the Morey Silt Loam developed on the
Pleistocene Beaumont Formation. Since the upper 10-30 cm
of the Morey typically is a silt loam underlain by a clay loam,
it may be either that archeological shells discarded on this
surface were intruded into the upper part of the Morey by
trampling or by the weight of loading as the deposit thickened. Alternatively, the roanâix in Layers 2 and 3 may be silty
loam eroded from the adjacent slightly higher elevations on
the Pleistocene surface that then were trapped in the shell
interstices. In either event, the area may have been continuously or often wet or submerged given the paucity of terrestrial snails that were reported from Layers 2 and 3, the gleying
of Layer 1, and the abundant iron concretions in Layers 1
and 2.
The upper matrix-rich zone appears to extend over the
general area and is not confined to the surface of the shell
deposit, suggesting that this deposit is of a geological rather
than cultural nature. Moreover, its deep, black sediment resembles desiccated marsh deposits that may have been thoroughly reworked by earthworms. This upper zone, like the
lower one, also has few terrestrial snails again suggesting
that the area was often wet or intermittently submerged. The
grain size trends in both Layers 2 and 3 and Layers 10 (lower)
and 10 (upper) coarsen upward further supporting this interpretation. That is to say, as deposition of the geological
sediments tapered off, the relative proportion of shell materials would rise, resulting in a coarsening upward sequence.
Taken together, all these indications point at there being
little archeological significance to the matrix characteristics
of the upper and lower zones. They may be due only to
natural processes that intersect in space at the archeo!ogica! site. At this point, the discussion cannot be taken much
further, but the observation of the three-part aggradational
model at certain other lowland shell mounds in the northern
Gulf may indicate that regional geo!ogical processes are at
work creating these conditions. The question of how this
local geography of Gaulding relates to paleoenvironments
will be addressed in a subsequent section of this report.
Archeological Processes
Whatever the orientation and local geography at the
time the site began to accumulate, it nevertheless was founded
on a gullied Pleistocene soil, possibly the Wallisville Paleosol,
perched near the upland edge of the nanâow but deep Taylor
Bayou entrenched valley. The first layer of archeological
sediment apparently is a secondary deposit. It includes only
the kind of materials that could effectively be moved: whole
shells and large fragments. In relation to other layers, there
is little in the way of bone, charcoal, or small shell fragments.
The inequity of right valves in favor of left valves also may
suggest relocated masses of previously discarded shell.
There is a less obvious possibility, however. A number
of archeological quahog deposits on the southwest Florida

37

coast have been observed to consist primarily of left-handed
valves (Luer 1986). While a variety of explanations were
suggested, the short answer is that no explanation could be
strongly supported. For example, it is tempting to think that
human handedness had something to do with the situation.
And, indeed, if a right-handed person meant to use a fresh
clam shell as a scraper or cutting tool, a left-handed shell
would be more feasible as a convenience tool. But this does
not explain why the surplus of left-handed shells remains in
the site. Nevertheless, the Florida evidence, combined with
the material evidence for the contents of Layer 2, reinforce
the notion that the differences in this layer are more than a
random curiosity. A cultural explanation of some sort remains to be found. All we can say now is that whatever was
the purpose for harvesting and opening Rangia cuneata
clams and oysters in Layer 2 time, it would have entailed
building fires and exposing shellfish to heat, thereby creating signature residues that are not present in the B- 1 (west)
area of this layer.
If the clastic sediment matrix in Layer 3 is disregarded,
Layers 3 through 9 are very similar in their contents. Even
though these layers formed at significantly different times,
they are more or less alike in the mix they contain of burned
shell, shell fragments, bone, charcoal, and similar numbers
of right and left clam valves. All of this suggests that the
bulk samples from these layers were in proximity to the locations of fire hearth, meat cooking, clam opening and shell
disposal activities. No evidence of lithic artifact maintenance
was found in the bulk samples and very little was found in
the excavations.
Numerous well-defined deposits of fragmented or whole
shell were seen in the stratigraphic reference cores from these
layers. This further suggests they were primary deposits, although there is no reason for or against the possibility that
some of the discarded whole shells were removed from this
area and secondarily deposited elsewhere. Probably such
deposits, if they exist, are on the periphery of the shell mound,
wherever that was located at the time. For example, the steeply
tilting deposits in cross-section C-Câ (Figure 6) probably identify material discarded at the edge of the site. Although fragmented-shell lenses also are identified in the tilted deposits,
one of the lessons from the grain size analyses and from the
three-pole plots is that observing the texture of shell site sediments only at the outcrop easily can be misleading insofar as
grain size is concerned. In this regard, it also is not certain
what to make of the outcrop observation that shell orientation
in nearly the entire Lower Analysis Unit appeared to be random while most in the Middle and Upper Analysis Units appeared horizontal. This may indicate that Layers 2, 3, 4, and 6
specifically were secondary deposits.
Finally, and disregarding the apparently natural sedimentation that forms much of Layer 10, with sparse archeological deposits perhaps being incorporated during intermittent drying out of this marsh-like surface, formation of
the upper zone appears to be somewhat similar to Layers 3

38

through 9. There is, however, an important diflâerence in the
ratio of shellfish consumption to vertebrate animal consumption. The reduction in burned shell proportion might be related to having to heat fewer but larger shells; if this was the
case, though, it should have been evident also in Layers 6
through 9. The limited amount of burned shell may instead
be related to the ground surface being comprised more of
clastic sediment and less of clam shells.
The major archeological difference in the contents of
Layer ! 0 versus earlier deposits is the relatively great abundance of finely comminuted bone fragments and of very tiny
but whole bones of small animals. Vertebrae, long bones,
extremities, and crushed fragments of more massive bones
all were seen in point-counting the 1~ fractions. These may
suggest that very small animals were eaten whole and that
the tiny bony remains were included in human stools voided
at this location. While a significant change in subsistence
may be indicated, this type of eating also may have occurred
during the earlier layers, but the defecated remains were
located elsewhere away fi:om the clam and food preparation
areas.
On the other hand, these bones may be the natural residues of small animals living and dying on this surface over
several centuries. Layer 10 accumulated over a very long

period of time probably during which it often was not suitable for habitation, perhaps because it was too wet. Again,
without at least a two-dimensional picture of this kind of
data, it is hard to be certain of its meaning.
In conclusion, the formation processes at the Gaulding
site were complex. Both natural processes and cultural processes were active simultaneously. The cultural evidence
may be demonstrating primary hearth area and associated
refuse deposits, secondary refuse deposits, and latrine areas. Whether the Rangia clams were all prepared for food
consumption on the spot, for use elsewhere, or as bait could
not be determined. Given the prominence of such animals as
alligators, garfish, and turtles in the faunal collection, the
possibility of bait gathering is reasonable but whether this
would account for a significant amount of shell refuse is
hard to say. No other specialized technological activity areas were identified. But if an array of samples can be obtained in a future excavation at Gaulding, with a view toward
resolving these questions in mind from the outset, it may be
possible to identify some of the lateral arrangement of activities across the surti~ce of individual layers. From this, it
may be possible to begin to appreciate some of the organizational structure of such settlements.

TECHNOLOGY

CERAMICS
Only a small collection of potsherds (739) was recovered from the excavations at Gaulding and their culture-historical usefulness is limited by the apparent absence of any
stratigraphic separation; most of the excavated sherds were
found in the 0-6 inch (0-15 cm) level. The pottery was examined with two objectives in mind: 1) recognizing the historical implications of typological distinctions; and 2) preliminary exploration of ceramic technology in the Sabine Lake
area. Ceramic typology is generally well established in the
northern Gulf region, even though refinements are ongoing.
Investigations into ceramic technology, on the other hand,
are just becoming a focus of research in the region (e.g., Ellis
1992 and others; Ensor 1997; Hood 1998; Kelley et al. 1994).

Sherd frequencies are given in Table 2; no adjustments
were made in the provenience table for vessel lots or reconstructed sherds, although comments on these are included
sometimes in the type descriptions. For technological analysis, however, the attributes of obvious vessel lots were tallied only once, not cumulatively on multiple sherds from a
single vessel. In the case of those varieties represented at
Gaulding by a relatively large collection of sherds, attributes
were documented on all of the rim and base sherds but only
on a sample of the body sherds. For the latter, a minimum of
30 sherds was examined and their attributes recorded. This
number was anâived at by comparing the means of quantitative grain size estimates in 10, 20, and 30 sherd samples; the
differences between successively greater sample sizes were
very small, usually less than 3 percent. The procedures for
recording formal and technological attributes are described
below.

T3a~logy
The system of pottery typology employed on this small
collection generally follows Aten (1983b:221-245) along with
more recent developments as reviewed in Ensor (1995:185202). Although questions have been raised about the use of
variety unspec~âed rather than a named established variety
(Weinstein et al. 1988; 1989) as well as certain other classificatory issues, this report does not seem an appropriate place
to debate them when so few sherds of any type are at issue.
We have, however, incorporated Mandeville as a variety of
the Tchefuncte type as recommended by Weinstein and Rivet
(1978).
All sherds in the Gaulding collection were first examined on fresh breaks with a 10x binocular microscope. Then
they were separated into type/variety groups or, if appropriate, into informal descriptive categories based on paste and
design characteristics. Once the categorical separations were
made, each group was closely examined for paste, form, and
design attributes. There were few sherds illustrating form
and even fewer illustrating design motifs. The principal opportunity for technological analysis in this collection was to
observe paste and firing characteristics on body sherds.

Paste and firing criteria
Paste colnposition
It was expected that clays used for each ceramic taxon
would be distinctive, reasonably uniform, and function as a
unit in the manufacturing process. In order to convey the
complexity of the ceramic pastes, all major components temper, sand, matrix (i.e., clay/silt)- were identified and their
proportional contribution to the whole was visually estimated. Standard charts for visually estimating proportions
of constituents (e.g., Folk 1951) were used to record the
abundance of sand sizes, and of grog, bone, or shell temper;
the residual was assumed to be matrix (silt and clay). All
sand grain sizes (e.g., coarse, medium, fine, etc.) are described
in the Wentworth scale (Folk 1980:23).
The procedure used here was to draw the sample sherds
without selection from the box of all sherds of a particular
category and to line them up on a table in the order of their
lot number. Each then was examined in sequence for one
attribute at a time (e.g., surface treatment) until the entire

39

Test Excavations at the Gaulding Site (41JF27), J~ferson Count3~ Texas

40

sample had been recorded. Then they were all gone through
for the next attribute, and so on. The benefit here was to
keep the eye and mind trained on one element at a time. This
was especially important when visually estimating the proportions of particular grain sizes. Visual estimates of constituents can be difficult to replicate unless great care is
used. Here, the classification was clone by fiâequently referring to a Wentworth grain size standard, doing only one size
class (e.g., coarse grains) at a time for the entire sample of
sherds, and periodically rechecking sherds that had been
previously examined. For the purposes of verbally summarizing proportional estimates, the following ordinal groupings were sometimes used to simplify the data: common
(>25%); moderate (10-20%); and rare (1-5%). Thus, a group
of sherds averaging I percent coarse sand, 15 percent medium-grai~ed sand, and 30 percent fine-grained sand would
also be said to have rare coarse sand, moderate medium
sand and common fine sand. This approach was used in the
type descriptions.
Paste texture
This term was used to refer solely to the degree to which
the paste had voids resulting from any of several causes,
especially poor coil wedging, oxidation of organic material,
and clay shrinkage. Sherds were impressionistically classed
as compact (no voids), occasional, and abundant.
Irou concretions
Ferrug~nous concretions are commonly found in many
of the younger Pleistocene and Holocene sediments of the
upper coast region. The number of sherds in each sample
with such inclusions in the paste was recorded and may
distinguish certain ceramic groups.

MunseH color
Surface color was treated somewhat differently from
customary approaches. As is well-known, vessels and sherds
from the northern Gulf coast usually display a substantial
variation in coloration depending on the clay used, temper,
firing conditions, uses made of the vessel, and so on. However, the color variation on a sherd usually falls within an
overall color range. For this reason, the full Munsell color
classification (Anonymous 1994) of hue, value, and chroma
was not attempted on sherds; this would have required either several determinations for each sherd, or a questionable judgment about which of the range of colors present
was important to document. Neither approach would improve the reliability or utility of the color data. Instead, the
range of colors in a sherd usually included values and chromas confined within a single Munsell color hue; this latter
was recorded for each sherd in the paste sample. As a general matter, though, surface colors for a given hue tended to
fall between 5 to 7 value and 2 to 4 chroma in the Munsell
notation system.

Oxidatiou pattern
Firing characteristics are hard to analyze in the routine
ceramic analyses of site reports. Therefore, in addition to
simplifying the Munsell color data as described above, a
different approach was devised for compiling quantitative
evidence that would suggest the firing approach usually
applied by the potters of a particular ceramic category. Recognizing the potential three zones of a fired ceramic (exterior surface, core, interior surface), a three-part number was
recorded for each sherd beginning with the exterior coded
first, core second, and interior last. Colors were coded as 1
for the lightest color, 2 for the next darker colo~; and 3 for
the darkest color. If all three zones were the same color, the
sherd was recorded as "111." If the interior was darker than
the exterior and there was no core, it would be recorded as
"102." A sherd of equal color on exterior and interior with a
darker core would be recorded as "121 ;" a sherd with light
exterior, darker interior, and even darker core would be recorded as "132;" and so on. Through this notation it was
possible to compile quickly a data set describing the imprint of the firing process and subsequent use on the clay
vessel through the relationships of oxidation to reduction.
Summarizing these for each sample seems to record patterns of firing that are characteristic of some of the ceramic
categories.

Surface treatment (interior/exterior)
With the aid of low power magnification, surface treatment was classed as scraped only (leaving coarse striations
fiâom dragging coarser grains); smoothed when wet or leather
hard (matrix material spread and smoothed over surface irregularities, temper, or sand grains near the sherd surface);
burnished (a light-reflecting sheen and possibly a floated
layer); and eroded (final surface treatment removed by mechanical abrasion).
Vessel tbrm characteristics
Rim/lip Jbrm
Where possible the rim diameter was estimated, although
we required that any rim section used for measurement comprise at least 5 percent of the circumference. Three features
of rims were recorded: rim form (everted, straight, and inverted); lip form (flat, ridged, and rounded); and lip modification (top notch perpendicular to rim; top notch diagonal
to rim; inner edge notch; outer edge notch; and scalloped).
Notations were made of whether the lip notches were narrow incised lines, V-shaped notches, or U-shaped notches.

l oay
The only body sherd characteristic routinely documented was thickness. Thickened or thinned rims and thickened bases usually involve only a small area of the whole
vessel, while body thickness is a predominant structural
feature.

Chapter 3: Technology

Base form
These included fiat, round, and node shapes. Where
possible, the angle between fiat base and body wall was
measured.
Vessel repair
Drilling holes on both sides of a crack and tying the
break together occasionally repaired vessel walls. Alternatively, asphalt was smeared over a leak or small crack. To
repair cracks developing during the air-drying phase, sometimes a clay patch was formed over the crack and then the
vessel was fired. Although not for repair purposes, holes
occasionally were drilled near the rim. Judging from the upward direction of abrasion neat" the hole, and considering
that local prehistoric ceramics probably were not strong
enough to bear the tensional forces on such a hole from the
weight of a suspended vessel and its contents, such holes
were more likely used to fasten a cover over the vessel mouth.
Design
Designs present in this collection were noted as incised, punctated, or brushed. Because of the small number
of decorated sherds, design motifs were not classified, although they are described.
Grain size data for formal ceramic types and varieties are
in Table 3; paste and firing attributes are in Table 4; and
vessel form attributes are in Table 5. This information for the
minor descriptive categories is included in their separate

sand (Figure 17b).

CONSTRUCTION AND FIRING
(Table 4) These sherds erode easily making surface treatment difficult to document; scraping is the only technique
observed. None of the sherds has a compact paste; all have
either occasional or abundant voids. The color of most
sherds is in the 7.5 and 10YR ranges; one sherd is in the 5YR
range. The oxidation pattern of most sherds is light on both
surfaces with darker core; the others are either uniform or
have no core.
VESSELFORM
(Table 5) No rims or bases were recovered. The body
wall thickness of the sherds in the Gaulding sample, determined from a very small sample, averaged 7.7 mm, thicker
than any of the other types.
Tchefuncte Plain vat. Mandeville
BACKGROUND
The Mandeville variety likewise is found widely in small
numbers in sites of the Sabine Lake area. It is known as very
similar to Tchefuncte Plain in appearance and vessel forming technique but differs in having a distinctly coarser paste
texture (Aten 1983b). Here, Mandeville is classified as a variety of Tchefuncte Plain according to the discussion in
Weinstein and Rivet (1978:26-30).

Pottery descriptions
Tchefuncte Plain, vat. Tchefuncte
BACKGROUND
The established variety of Tchefuncte Plain is found
widely in small numbers throughout the coastal zone of the
northern Gulf and is locally abundant in the Sabine Lake
area. In sherd form it is indistinguishable from Lower Mississippi Valley Tchefuncte Plain. There are so few vessel
data that comparisons at that level are not yet possible. At a
sherd level, however, there are no real differences between
the original concept of Tchefuncte Plain and the sherds found
across the northern Gulf into Texas. And so, the classification used in Weinstein and Rivet (1978) is adopted here.

41JF27 SAMPLE
8 sherds (7 if vessel associations are discounted), Table
2.
PASTE
(Tables 3, 4) Little more than half the Mandeville sherds
contain iron concretions in the paste. Medium-grained sand
was rare in one sherd; fine-grained sand was rare in most
sherds and moderately abundant in one; and very finegrained sand was present in all sherds about equally divided between common and moderate abundances.
Mandeville paste composition stands out as similar to but
distinct from variety Tchefuncte and probably occupies an
intermediate position between the latter and Goose Creek
pastes (Figure 17a).

41JF27 SAMPLE
5 sherds, Table 2.
PASTE
(Tables 3, 4) All sherds in this sample include iron concretions in the clay. Although typically fine textured to the
touch, microscopic examination revealed that fine sand grains
are present but in less than half of the sherds and in rare (i.e.,
1-5%) proportions. Very fine sand occurs in all sherds; moderate (10-20%) amounts in 40 percent of the sherds, rare (15%) in the remainder. The overwhelming portion of the paste

CONSTRUCTION AND FIRING
(Table 4) These sherds erode easily making surface finish difficult to record; of the 3 observable sherds, two were
finished by scraping and the other by smoothing while wet.
One sherd has many probably accidenta! fingernail impressions on the interior. Almost 60 percent of the sherds have
occasional paste voids with the remainder having abundant
voids. Coils are not welded together very well with coil surfaces prominent in fractures. One sherd has colors in the
7.5YR range while all the others are in the 10YR range. The

VESSEL FORM
(Table 5) Only one rim sherd was found; it is everted
with a ridged lip and no lip modification. The few body sherds
present have a relatively thick body wall averaging 7.3 ram.

CONSTRUCTION AND FIRING
(Table 4) A little over half of the sherd sample was either
too small to determine final surface treatment or was too
eroded. However, of the remaining half, approximately 90
percent of both interior and exterior surfaces had been
smoothed while the clay was still wet with the remainder
having been burnished.
The paste generally was well compacted; occasional
voids from either shrinkage or combustion of organic inclusions were present in 83 percent of the sherds; the remain-

Because of this sorting gap between large and small grains

the sand was added as temper.

der was divided between sherds with abundant voids or
none. Nearly 90 percent of the Conway sherds had colors
encompassed by the 7.5YR and 10YR Munsell color cards;
the few remaining sherds were of the redder 2.5YR and 5YR
colors.

41JF27 SAMPLE

About 20 percent of the sherds had no core developed
during firing. Some 90 percent of the sample had a light

52 sherds, Table 2.
PASTE
(Table 3, 4) Nearly 40 percent of the sherds contain iron
nodules in the clay, a relatively low proportion compared to
other Gaulding site ceramics. Coarse sand is found in nearly
90% of all OâNeal Plain sherds but in small amounts (moderately abundant in 14% of sherds; rare in 75% of sherds; and
absent in 11%). Because of the large size of these grains,
small amounts are sufficient to give a strong impression of
exceptional coarseness in the paste.
Medium-grained sand also is found in all OâNeal sherds
in the 41JF27 sample (common in nearly two-thirds of all
sherds; moderately abundant in one-third; and rare in only
about 3% of the sherds). Fine-grained sand is found only in
little more than a third of the OâNeal sherd sample (commonly in about 6%; moderately abundant in less than onethird; rarely in about 3%; and absent in 61% of the sherds).
The triangular plot (Figure 17a) shows that these sand sizes
and proportions combine in sherds in ways that are totally
distinct from practically all other pottery types that contain
sand.

exterior and a dark core (or interior surface if no core); the
remaining 10 percent were reversed with a dark exterior and
lighter core or interior. This suggests that the principal firing
procedure did not involve smothering the fire to create reducing conditions. The clay used was generally clean (few
burned-out organic inclusions), coils were well-compacted,
and firing was generally to an oxidized state. The coarse
texture of the paste is an obvious feature of all sherds, atthough when newly made these pots seem to have had wellsmoothed to burnished surfaces.

VESSEL FORM AND DESIGN
(Table 5) Of the rim sherds present, one each were
everted or inverted, two were straight, and one was indeterminate. Of these rims, four had flat lips and one had a rounded
lip form; in addition four tips had no further modification and
one had incisions diagonal to the rim direction. There was
one flat base with an estimated base/wall angle of 30 degrees. It was only possible to make one estimate of orifice
diameter in this collection; that vessel was approximately
32.5 cm in diameter. The mean body sherd thickness was 6.2
ram. The Gaulding site sample of the Conway variety in-

VESSEL FORM
(Table 5) One rim sherd was found which was too small
to use for estimating rim diameter or rim form, but the lip was
ridged and not modified. There is a suggestion of the common Tchefuncte-Mandeville diagonal ridge and furrow surface molding. Coil wedging is highly variable on this pottery; some sherds are like Mandeville with the interior and
exterior surfaces both smoothed upward. Others show the
down on interior and up on exterior smoothing that is typical
of Goose Creek wares. The average body thickness of the
body sherds is 6.6 mm.
Goose Creek Plain, vat. unspecified
BACKGROUND
This is one of the most common pottery varieties at all
times from southwest Louisiana to the central Texas coast. It
is thought to be made of naturally occurring sand/silt/clay
assemblages rather than be artificially prepared pottery clay.
41JF27 SAMPLE
154 sherds (143 if vessel associations are discounted),

PASTE
(Tables 3, 4) Three-fourths of the sherds in this sample
include iron concretions in the paste. Coarse-grained sand
is rarely present in 7 percent of the sample. Medium-grained
sand is rarely present in a little more than half of the sample.
Fine-grained sand is present in almost all sherds (rarely in 20
percent, moderately in over 63 percent, and commonly in
about 10 percent). Very fine-grained sand is present in all
sherds (moderately in over 40 percent of the sherds, and
commonly in over 50 percent of the sherds). Compared to
other ceramic varieties there is a fairly wide range of sand
grain size combinations in Goose Creek Plain var. unspecified (Figure 17a).

Baytown Plain, variety San Jacinto
BACKGROUND
Weinstein (1991:102-106) argued that this sparsely grogtempered sandy paste ware be renamed to its own series
(San Jacinto Series) with types for plain and incised wares.
Patterson (1995) made a similar proposal largely as a matter
of simplifying classification terminology. These proposals
are not used at this time for reasons rooted in the discussion
of southeastern U.S. pottery innovation presented elsewhere
(Aten 1983b:297-299). Briefly, this view is that the development of grog-tempered technology is a major southeastern

Test Excavations at the Gaulding Site (41JF27), Jefferson Count3; Texas

US innovation, largely centered in the Lower Mississippi
Valley, and was projected outward north, east, and west. We
currently believe that considering these sandy paste grogtempered ceramics as part of this regional technological diffusion phenomenon and related to Baytown helps maintain
focus on the central cultural problem -- diflâusion of basic
technologies. In any event, this is not a major practical problem because Weinsteinâs pottery categories are identica! to
ours; only the nomenclatural solution to the underlying cause
differs. Eventually, though, these conceptual differences wil!
have to be reconciled.

(Tables 3, 4)Approximately half of the attribute sample

unspec{fied pastes but is decidedly finer grained. This may
suggest that the vat: San Jacinto paste matrix is not as
similar to Goose Creek as we have previously thought.
CONSTRUCTION AND FIRING
(Table 4) Two-thirds to three-fourths of the sherds were
smoothed while wet with the remainder divided among all
the other treatments. The sample pastes predominantly have
occasional to abundant voids, presumably reflecting a greater
use of clays containing organic matter. Most of the sherd
colors are in the 10YR range. The oxidation pattern is predominantly lightest on the exterior and usually with a darker
core than either surface.
VESSEL FORM
(Table 5) Rims are mostly everted or inverted, lips are
flat, ridged, or rounded, and are occasionally scalloped. One
round base was found. The mean thickness of a sample of
body sherds was 6.0 mm and two vessel rim diameters were
estimated at about 19 and 35 cm.
Baytown Plain, variety Phoenix Lake
41JF27 SAMPLE
72 sherds, Table 2.
PASTE
(Tables 3, 4) Like the variety San Jacinto, about half of
the variety Phoenix Lake sherds contain iron nodules. However, it has no sand in the paste and a much higher proportion of grog particles.

CONSTRUCTION AND FIRING
(Table 4) Surface treatments are generally similar to those

of variety San Jacinto, with a majority of sherds smoothed
while wet. However, there is a stronger tendency for Phoenix
Lake sherds to have burnished surfaces. Paste texture of the
sample sherds is similar to variety San Jacinto with most
sherds having occasional or abundant voids. Sherd colors
cover a wider range, fiâom 10YR to 2.5YR. The oxidation pattern is very similar to that of variety San Jacinto.

VESSELFORM
(Table 5) Most of the rims are everted, with flat lips and
rarely are scalloped. A flat and a noded base were found.

17 sherds (6 if sherds from vessel lots are discounted),
Table 2.
PASTE
(Tables 3, 4) Two-thirds of the small sample of pastes
contained iron nodules. Grog particles were present in moderate abundance in all sherds while one sherd had rare fine
sand and half the sherds had moderate amounts of very fine
sand.
CONSTRUCTION AND FIRING
(Table 4) Surface treatments of this small sample are in
the same range as the Baytown plainware. Most of the sherds
have occasional voids and one is a compact paste. Sherd
colors are predominantly in the 7.SYR range. The oxidation
pattern is lighter on the exteriors and a darker core.
VESSEL FORM AND DESIGN
(Table 5) Rims are inverted or straight with flat lips and
lip notching is perpendicular to the rim. One rim diameter
could be estimated at 17.5 cm. Three incised design motifs
are present: 1) simple horizontal lines; 2) simple bands around
the rim, one with pendant triangles, and filled with parallel
lines to create a zoned design; and 3) a fragment of a complex design including vertical zones of chevrons, horizontal
lines, and possibly scalloped areas pendant from horizontal
lines (Figure 18a-e). The first of these motifs is commonly
found on several incised pottery types of the Texas and
Louisiana coast. The second motif is particularly reminiscent of Mazique Incised fiâom Louisiana (R. Weinstein, personal communication, 1999).

proportions of medium, fine, and very fine sand are present
in these sherds.
CONSTRUCTION AND FIRING
(Table 4) Surfaces were smoothed while wet. Both sherds
have compact pastes. Their colors are in the 10YR and 7.SYR
ranges. The oxidation patterns are in the ranges of the other
grog-tempered warns.
VESSEL FORM
(~Table 5) One of the rims is everted. The lip is ridged; lip
modification cannot be determined. The rim diameter is nearly
14 cm. Two incised design motifs common to the Texas coastal
region are represented: 1 ) a simple horizontal line around the
rim just under the lip; and 2) a band probably around the rim
bordered by a horizonta! line and filled with a zigzag line
(Figure 18f-g).
Miscellaneous ceramics
Several descriptive categories of ceramics were identified that did not conform to any currently recognized pottery types or varieties. All were present in small numbers but
are interesting because of the external relationships they
suggest.
GROG-AND BONE-TEMPERED BRUSHED
This is a single vessel represented by 19 sherds (Table
2). The paste includes common grog particles and moderate
amounts of bone; the matrix is silty clay and contains no
sand. Iron nodules occasionally are present. The paste is
compact and the color is in the 10YR range. The interior
surface was smoothed while wet. The vessel rim is everted,
with a fiat lip that is notched on the inner edge. The base is
fiat and the base/wall angle is 33 degrees. The rim diameter is
12.5 cm. Taken togethm; these characteristics suggest a small,
restricted orifice, flat-based jar (Figure 18h). The exterior
surface is covered with a brushed design, possibly using
the broken end of a twig as a stylus. There am circular punctations immediately below the lip and descending from these
are paralle! and diagonal brushed lines. The body of the
vessel has vertical, brushed lines. Taken together, these indicate that the rim area was brushed differently from the
vessel body. This vessel is distinctively unlike indigenous
northern Gulf coast pottery. The technique and style of
brushing, including treating the rim differently from the body
as well as the particular grog and bone tempering, suggest
Caddo manufacture. Such brushed ware was common in
Neches River Caddo sites from circa AD 1300 to historic times
(Dee Ann Story, personal communications, 1995 and 1999)
SAND- AND GROG-TEMPERED PLAIN
There is one sherd (Table 2) that has rare medium sand
and moderate fine sand, but no very fine sand; grog particles are present in moderate proportion. The discontinuity
between sand and the silt!clay matrix suggests this vessel
was tempered with both sand and grog. The paste contained

iron nodules, had abundant voids, and relatively more red
colors of the 5YR range. The oxidation pattern was light on
the exterior, darker on the interior, and there was no core.
The body wall was relatively thin at 4.8 mm.

GROG-AND SHELL-TEMPERED PLMN
There are 12 sherds, all from one vessel (Table 2), that
have rare fine sand and moderate very fine sand along with
moderate proportions of grog and shell particles. This indicates that the grog and shell were temper added to sandy
clay. The shell particles appear to be from oysters or freshwater mussels as the fragments tend to break into fiat platelets rather than the blocky fragments resulting from Rangia
cuneata shell. The paste contains iron nodules, is compact, and its color is in the 5YR range. The oxidation pattern is lightest on the interior, darker on the exterior, and
darkest in the core, the reverse of most local ceramics. The
surface treatment on the vessel interior was smoothed probably during the leather hard state, while the exterior was
burnished. The body wall thickness was 5.3 mm. These
sherds do not appear to be of Caddo origin (D.A. Story,
personal communication, 1995) and may be fiâom a late Coles
Creek or Plaquemine vessel of lower Mississippi valley
origin (R. Weinstein, personal communication, 1999). A small
campsite, radiocarbon dated to the late Coles Creek Period
with appropriate ceramics was excavated west of Holly
Beach, Louisiana (Stopp 1976; Wiseman et al. 1979:5-3).
That site is only 45 km, as the crow flies, fi:om Gaulding.
Given other contemporaneous ceramics and radiocarbon
dates from Gaulding, the presence of such a late Coles
Creek or early Mississippi period grog and shell-tempered
vessel is not implausible.
BONE-TEMPERED PLAIN
Three sherds, all possibly from the same vessel (Table
2), have common bone particles and rare fine sand. No grog
was seen and the bone particles are more abundant than in
the Caddoan grog- and bone-tempered vessel. The paste
contains iron nodules, occasional voids, and is in the 10YR
color range. The oxidation pattern is the same color on the
interior and exterior and there is no core. Both interior and
exterior surfaces were smoothed when wet. Body wall thickness is 5.6 mm. There are some indentations on the exterior
surface that might be brushing, but this is uncertain.
SAND-AND BONE-TEMPERED PLAIN
One sherd (Table 2) was found with rare medium sand,
moderate fine sand, but no very fine sand, and rare bone
particles. The paste contains iron nodules, but is compact,
and has colors in the 10YR range. The oxidation pattern is
lightest on the interior, darker on the exterior, and has no
core. Surface treatments cannot be evaluated because of
erosion. Body wall thickness is 4.3 mm.

and late - and there may well have been others in the intervening time (cf., Figure 9).

Discussion
The Gaulding site pottery collection lacks high-resolution physical separation, so it cannot make a contribution
insofar as ceramic chronostratigraphy is concerned. However, beyond using ceramic typology to map culture history
and the intrasite spatial distribution of technological clusters, there is a need to continue defining the characteristics
of southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana prehistoric ceramics as distinct technologies. Exploring the cultural aspects of pottery manufacture has begun in recent years in
the nearby Galveston Bay area (Ellis 1992; Ennes and Flood
1997; Gadus and Howard 1990; Hood 1998; Kelley et al. 1994).
Following that lead, several technological questions will be
addressed to the extent that this relatively small data set wil!
permit.
~

Ceramic technology
Only four of the 16 pottery varieties found in the
Gaulding excavations were present in numbers sufficient to
analyze some of their technological characteristics statistically (Tables 3, 4, and 5). These were OâNeal Plain var.
Conway, Goose Creek Plain var. unspecified, Baytown Plain
va~: Phoenix Lake, and Baytown Plain var. San Jacinto. In
this analysis, Goose Creek Plain va~: unspecified refers to all
of the Goose Creek plainware except those separated out as
va~: Anahuac. When appropriate, other varieties will be mentioned.
Paste texture: Goose Creek Plain va~: unspecified has
the most compact paste of the four varieties being discussed;
nearly half of those sherds have no voids and a similar proportion has voids only occasionally. The two Baytown Plain
varieties are just the reverse, with nearly half having abundant voids and a similar proportion having occasional voids.
OâNeal Plain vat. Conway is squarely in the middle with an
overwhelming majority of its sherds having only occasional
voids. Whether these differences are due to vessel forming
and drying technique or to firing consequences of their respective pottery clay mixtures is not yet known, but the
differences at this site are distinctive.
Munsell color: All of the four varieties discussed here
had more than 80 percent of their sample in the 7.5 and 10YR
color ranges. Both OâNeal Plain var. Conway and Baytown
Plain va~: Phoenix Lake tended more toward the redder colors of the YR range. Goose Creek Plain van unsT)ec~fied and
Baytown Plain va~: San Jacinto were both similar in having
nearly two-thirds of their sherds in the 10YR group and
tended more strongly toward the yellow end of the range.
Iron concretions: Ferruginous concretions are found
locally in many of the younger Pleistocene and Holocene
fluvial sediments. OâNeal Plain vat. Conway sherds had the
fewest concretions (39 percent), the two Baytown Plain varieties had them in about half their sherds, and the Goose
Creek Plain va~: unspecified had iron concretions in 75 percent of its sherds. These differences may point to preferences for clay sources among potters of the several types.
The OâNeal potters selected clay that intentionally or coincidentally also did not have many iron concretions. There
was a 50:50 chance that the Baytown potters would select a
clay containing concretions; and the Goose Creek Plain potters selected clays, possibly from the Pleistocene Beaumont
Formation, that very often had concretions.
Oxidation pattern: OâNeal Plain vat. Conway and both
Baytown varieties share similar oxidation patterns with nearly
all sherds being uniformly colored throughout, or lighter in
color on their exterior surfaces and having a darker core. Goose
Creek Plain va~: unspecified, however, differs notably in having nearly half the sherds in the sample with a reverse pattern
- dark exterior/light interior or lighter core than surfaces.

Ceratnics within the site
All pottery was confined to the northern and probably
largely the northeastern quadrant of the site (Figure 19). No
pottery was found in test pit C- 1 or in any of the postholes
or pothole backdirt piles in the southern half of the site.
Coincident with this area, the thickness map and cross-section (Figure 10) show the deposits (Layer 10) in the northern
half of the site to be roughly 30 cm thicker than in the southern half probably due to the bulking effect of occasional
shell-related habitation deposits. This thickened area, where
the pottery was found, is the only part of Gaulding impinging directly on the shoreline of Taylor Bayou. The evidence
of layer thickness and pottery distribution apparently outlines the area (approximately 400 square meters) of the late
prehistoric occupations and distinguishes them from the
preceramic occupations. Plots of sherds from the same vessels indicates that some were separated by as much as 6 m,
but there is no other evidence now available with which to
make better statements about the spatial organization of late
prehistoric site use.

Ceramic dating
Nearly all ceramics came from the top 6-inch (15-cm)
level. Tchefuncte Plain varieties Tchefimcte and Mandeville,
and Goose Creek Plain va~: Anahuac are all early ceramics
probably dating in the Sabine to approximately 1900 to 2200
years ago. The bone- and shell-tempered vessel, and the
Caddoan-like grog and bone-tempered brushed vessel represent a much later time period - only 600 to 800 years ago
more or less. The other plainware types such as Goose Creek
Plain vat: unspecified, OâNeal Plain va~: Conway, and the
Baytown Plain varieties could be associated with either extreme or with any time between them. The San Jacinto Incised va~: Spindletop design motifs call Mazique Incised to
mind. On this information it appears that there were at least
two brief episodes of ceramics-using occupations - early

Chapter 3: Technology

These results may suggest that most pots of the former
varieties were fired while upside down possibly with additional fire fuel placed over the exterior. The pattern reversal
for nearly half of the Goose Creek vat. unspecified pottery
suggests frequent use of a different anâangement of fire and/
or pots, possibly with orifice facing into the fire. Some of
these latter vessels have cores lighter than surfaces suggesting that after extended firing that burned off all organics, the fire may have been smothered to cause reduction
and darkening of the exterior surface.
Paste composition: While the ordinal scaling of paste
constituents (Table 3) facilitated verbal descriptions of the
pottery varieties, plotting the proportions of the constituents for a sample of specimens in each type or variety permits a more quantitative and pictorial representation of their
differences. OâNeal Plain and the majority of Goose Creek
Plain vat: unspec~ed occupy very distinct positions in the
triangular graphs (Figure 17). Both Tchefuncte Plain varieties, Goose Creek Plain vat. Anahuac, Baytown Plain vat:
San Jacinto and the two San Jacinto Incised varieties all
substantially overlap with the very fine sand range of Goose
Creek Plain va~: unspecified (Figure 17a). However, Baytown
Plain vat: San Jacinto shows overall a widely varying sand
size content, which may also suggest that grain size was
relatively unimportant in clay selection for that ceramic.
Figure 17b displays the ratios of silt and clay matrix,
sand (natural or added), and bone, shell, and grog tempering
agents. All ceramic categories are more than half composed
of silt and clay matrix except for some Goose Creek Plain vat:
unspecified sherds. Baytown Plain vat: Phoenix Lake is exclusively a matrix/grog temper mix; Tchefuncte, OâNeal and
Goose Creek Plain (all varieties), are exclusively a matrix/
sand mix. Baytown Plain vat: San Jacinto, both San Jacinto
Incised varieties and the various rare bone, shell and grog
categories are relatively distinct mixes of all three components-matrix, sand, and temper.
Pottery clay sources: It has been suggested that most
pottery varieties on the upper Texas coast are made of natural sand/silt/clay assemblages modified sometimes by the
addition of grog, bone, shell, or sand temper (Aten 1983b:206245; but also see Ennes and Flood 1997:F-28). It was assumed, further, that OâNeal Plain va~: Conway with discontinuously distributed sand sizes is not a natural assemblage
but one in which coarse- and medium-grained sand has been
added as temper to a finer silt/clay mixture. Some testing of
this proposition has been carried out by analyzing sherd
sediments in thin sections or through other means (Ennes
and Flood 1997; Kelley et al. 1994). While these efforts have
been informative they were limited by sample sizes of not
more than 1 or 2 sherds per type or variety, thus giving little
sense of variation in manufacture. In the following section,
testing these proposals is continued with a different but
complementary approach. Again, the burden falls on OâNeal
Plain vat: Conway, Goose Creek Plain vat: unspecified, and
the two Baytown Plain varieties because only they have

55

sufficient sample sizes at the Gaulding site.
The discontinuity in grain sizes in OâNeal Plain vat.
Conway versus their relative continuity in Goose Creek Plain
vat: unspecified and Baytown Plain vat. San Jacinto is clearly
illustrated when plotting cumulative grain size curves for
the three pottery samples (Figure 20). The question is
whether any "natural" sediment deposits match the grain
sizes observed in the sherd samples. While small amounts
of larger sand sizes are found in various sediments around
the area it is not in sufficient quantities to resemble the OâNeal
paste. Minor amounts are found in the cheniers and modern
beaches but these also include a large shell component in
the sand fraction, something not seen in pottery (Stul11965;
Graf 1966; Byrne et al. 1959). The Cameron and Calcasieu
Parishes soil surveys and the Jefferson County soil survey
(Crout et al. 1965; Midkiff and Roy 1995; Roy and Midkiff
1988) all report a variety of soils derived from Pleistocene,
Holocene, and modern floodplain, delta, and coastal marsh
deposits but all have insufficient amounts of coarse sand to
resemble OâNeal pottery clays. In his study of Sabine Lake,
Kane (1959:229) reported that the most common bottom sediment is silt; very fine sand is found in limited areas and fine
sand is rare. No coarser material was found. In cores from
the buried Holocene Sabine River floodplain offshore, up to
approximately !0 percent sand larger than fine sand was
reported (Nelson and Bray 1970:58-59) but this too is an
insufficient proportion to mimic OâNeal pastes.
Several samples were found in soil surveys and a variety of geological studies that could be quantitatively plotted on three-pole graphs in the same manner as the sherd
data (Table 6). Plotting the sand fraction from the soil and
geological samples (Figure 17a), the marsh and natural levee
deposits overlap most of the ranges of the sandy paste ceramic types. The sand fraction of a modern beach plots away
from any sherd group, and only Neches River point bar sediments plotted similarly to the OâNeal Plain va~: Conway
sherds (also see Figure 20).
From the perspective of grain-size, at least, it appears
that the locally-made Gaulding pottery could have been
manufactured from natural levee deposits and certain Beaumont Formation facies for the sandy paste wares; various
marsh clays for the Tchefuncte, Baytown Plain vat: Phoenix
Lake, and San Jacinto Incised vat. Spindletop wares; and a
mix of local point bar sand with a sand-free clay/silt mixture
for making OâNeal Plain va~: Conway.
Surface treatment: Scraping both the interior and exterior surfaces seems to be proportionally more common on
the early Tchefuncte and Mandeville varieties than on any
other. All of the Goose Creek Plain vatâ. unspecified is
smoothed on interior and exterior while OâNeal Plain and
both Baytown Plain varieties are predominantly smoothed
but respectively show increasing proportions of burnishing. The two Baytown varieties also have definite minor
proportions of interior scraping. This is broadly consistent
with the findings on the lower Trinity River of burnishing

becoming more common later in time (Ensor 1995:282-286).
Vessel form: Since there were few sherds found in the
Gaulding excavations that provide clues to vessel form and
size these limited data can mainly yield suggestions and
hints. Body thickness measurements reported in the descriptions and on Table 5 suggest two broad groupings: a thinner-walled vessel group consisting of Goose Creek Plain
var. unspecified, Goose Creek Red-Filmed Plain vat: unspecified, Goose Creek Incised vat: unspecified, OâNeal Plain va~
Conway, and the two Baytown Plain varieties; and a slightly
thicker-walled vessel group consisting of both Tchefuncte
varieties, Goose Creek Plain var. Anahuac, and San Jacinto
Incised var. Spindletop.
Similarly, rim diameter measurements (Table 5) suggest
two groups of vessel sizes (10-19 cm. and 32.5-35 cm.), although the pottery taxa comprising these two groups are
nearly all from the group of thinner-walled vessels. There is

a tendency for the Goose Creek Plain vat: unspecified group
to have inverted rims, OâNeal Plain var Conway to have
straight rims, and for the grog-tempered varieties to have
everted rims. All groups tend to use flat lips more than other
lip forms. Most rims have no lip modification but the grogtempered vessels tend to be more likely to have modification
in the form of scalloping or perpendicular incised lines. There
are not enough bases to indicate tendencies although flat
bases are the most common in this collection as a whole.
Design motifs: The single Goose Creek Incised var. unspecified sherd may or may not be incised; the possible
motif is a very sloppy pair of horizontal lines that might only
be smoothing marks. San Jacinto Incised var. Jamison has
two motifs: a single horizontal line, and a partially preserved
motif consisting at least of a wide-stylus, horizontal, zigzag
line bounded below by a single fine horizontal line, and whatever was above the wide zigzag has been lost (Figure 18g).

The most interesting motifs were found on San Jacinto Incised val: Spindletop (Figure 18a-e). In addition to one or
more horizontal lines, one sherd has a band of pendant triangles filled with parallel vertical lines; another is incomplete but may be a band of diagonal parallel lines bounded
on bottom by a single horizontal line. The most complex
design also is fragmentary but consists of at least three
panels: one may be filled with horizontal lines; another with
a vertically oriented chevron or feather motif; and the third
with a line comprised of a succession of arcs under which
appears to be an excised area but this is not certain (Figure
18e).
Finally, the sherds from the imported Caddoan-like grogand bone-tempered brushed vessel (Figure 18h) have a row
of punctations around the rim and from this row is suspended diagonal brushing. Somewhere at or below the constricted neck of the vessel the brushing changes orientation
to vertical brush strokes, as these are evident near the base.
The stylus used appears to be the shredded end of a twig.
Vessel repairs and modifications: One Goose Creek Plain
van unsl)ecified has a single hole drilled near the rim apparently to fasten a cover rather than to stabilize a crack. One
OâNeal Plain vat. Conway sherd has a hole drilled well below
the rim and probably for crack repair. One Baytown Plain vat:
Phoenix Lake sherd is repaired with an asphalt patch over a
poorly wedged coil join that presumably leaked. Another
Baytown Plain vat: Phoenix Lake vessel represented by
three sherds was apparently covered with a thin layer of
asphalt on the exterior. Presumably neither of the latter yes-

sels was used near or over a fire or hot ashes because of the
asphalt.
Conclusions
The pottery collection from the Gaulding test excavations clearly indicates limited use of the uppermost 15 to 30
cm of the north half or northeast quadrant of the site early in
the ceramic period and again late in the ceramic period. Habitation probably occurred intermittently between these time
periods as well, but there is relatively little volume to these
deposits and so periodic use could not have occurred too
often. Going beyond the chronological and distributional
information from the pottery, the Gaulding data begins to
suggest the manufacturing activity underlying the Sabine
Lake area ceramic typology. From this collection, there appear to be at least 4 distinct modes of pottery manufacturing
represented in the Tchefuncte/Mandeville varieties, Goose
Creek Plain var. unspecified, OâNeal Plain vat: Conway, and
the local grog-tempered wares.
The Tchefuncte and Mandeville varieties maintain their
thick-walled, irregular forming techniques, and distinctive
clays.
Goose Creek Plain var. unspecified is distinguished by
the frequent selection of fine sandy clays with iron nodules,
a more compact paste texture than most other types, vessel
surfaces usually smoothed while the clay is still wet, and
firing techniques that are more variable in the resulting oxidation pattern than on other types.
OâNeal Plain var. Conway is distinctively tempered with

sands possibly from local point bar deposits, in addition,
the matrix clay that was selected avoids iron nodules more
than was done for other pottery types. Vessel surfaces were
usually smoothed while wet and the varietyâs attributes show
less variation than the other three groups indicating more
adherence to a manufacturing procedure.
The Baytown Plain grog-tempered varieties are distinctive in their selection of matrix clay, have the least compact of
all the paste textures possibly due to a higher organic content
of the clays, and show much variation in smoothing techniques including much more use of burnishing. Their firing
practices, however, may have less variation than other types,
as there is less variety in the oxidation characteristics.

in approximate terms to the Gaulding collection is the thin
section grain-size analysis of 11 sherds from the Clear Lake
Period component at Eagleâs Ridge (Ennes and Flood 1997).
Although grain sizes were recorded somewhat differently
than in the present study (silt was separately identified and
fine/very fine sands were combined), the results appear similar. The description of OâNeal Plain was practically identical
in both studies. The other early varieties (Tchefuncte and
Mandeville, Goose Creek Plain va~ Anahuac and va~: unspecified) often seemed a little finer-grained at Gaulding.
These differences could be due either to difficulty in comparing the size classes that were used for analysis, or to the
larger sample examined at Gaulding, which introduces more
variability.

In any event, the Eagleâs Ridge study is a positive
step as is the Gaulding analysis. Each tells something different about the local ceramics, and together they reveal
even more, indicating that the methods might fruitfully be
merged. The Eagleâs Ridge study uses petrography and
mineralogy methods but because of its destructive and
labor intensive nature can only be employed on a few specimens. The Gaulding study used low-power microscopic
methods on larger samples but require great care in making
visual estimates. The low power methods probably can be
connected to the thin-section method at the grain-size estimation, but then go on to record other attributes and
variability as well.
Presumably, each ceramic variety reflects the perceived
cultural norm for a technological, functional, or stylistic solution to some need for a container. So, how would activity
occur in the daily lives of Indians such that this archeological
ceramic assemblage could be created? All potters in the same
band (or whatever the face-to-face group was) could make the
same kind of pottery, but different bands then each would
have had to make different kinds of pottery, and an archeological assemblage could be the residue of different bands
occupying a single archeological site. Or, each potter in the
same band made a different ceramic variety and an archeological assemblage could be the residue of one or more single
band occupations. Or, individual potters in the same band
each made more than one kind of pottery, depending on the
groupâs current needs, with an archeological assemblage being the residue of one or more bandâs occupation and their
fnnctional needs for pottery vessels at that time.

Whatever were the cultural requirements that brought
an individual to manufacture a particular ceramic variety,
through space and over time many other potters made the
same kind or kinds of pottery. Their individual variations in
technique, predilection, and location may be the key aspects of the variation that is documented in the ranges of
attributes for each variety in Tables 3, 4, and 5 and in the
descriptions. Interestingly, the several pottery varieties continue to form relatively distinctive clusters as their attributes
are mapped in ever-greater detail. If native potters were making their primary manufacturing decisions on some attribute
other than paste (such as design or vessel form), it is hard to
see how such distinct paste clusters could continue to persist for long periods of time. These technologies should be
mapped more widely with uniform methods addressing both
the needs for detail as well as for sufficient sample sizes to
reflect variation. With that information, time and space differences may emerge that begin to answer questions about
the formation of such pottery assemblages as are found in
Sabine Lake area shell-bearing sites.
LITHIC ARTIFACTS
Only 73 non-ceramic artifacts were recovered from the
Gaulding site, most of which were lithics (Tables 7 and 8).
Whenever feasible the artifact categories followed established
usage. All specimens were examined with the aid of a 10x to
20x binocular microscope. Additional metric, color, and material data for lithic artifacts may be found in Table 8. As with
ceramics, references to grain size are in terms of the Wentworth
scale; color terminology is from the Munsell system.

Perdiz
(Figure 21a). The blade is triangular with prominent
downturned barbs. The stem is contracting, with a rounded
base, and comprises 1/a of the total length. Microscopic examination indicates some abrasion of prominences on the
stem and blade; bifacially chipped.
Miscellaneous arrow form
(Figure 21 b). A bi facially chipped artifhct; blade is triangular with serrated, straight edges and prominent shoulders. The stem is slightly contracting to a flat base; the basal
surface is the cortex surface of the resource cobble. This
specimen was misplaced before final descriptions were made.
Consequently, only a pencil sketch outline of the specimen
and general color description, rather than Munsell color, is
available.
Gay
(Figure 21c-d). Two examples of the Gary type were
found, both associated with the upper half of the upper
stratigraphic analysis unit. The first specimen (Figure 21c)
has a slightly asymmetrical, triangular blade with slightly
convex edges. The shoulders are prominent and project
slightly upward toward the distal end. The stem is slightly
asymmetrical and straight to slightly contracting with a
strongly rounded base. The stem comprises one-third of the
total length. Cortex is present on both faces of the specimen
indicating the original resource pebble was not much larger
than the final form of the tool.
The second specimen (Figure 21d) is missing much of
the blade. However, the blade form probably was triangular
with weakly developed shoulders. Cortex remains along one
side of the specimen. The stem is contracting, asymmetrical,
and has a rounded base.
Miscellaneous dart form 1
(Figure 21 e). The blade is roughly triangular with convex edges; the shoulders are weakly developed. The stem is
straight with a flat base and comprises about one-third the
total artifact length. Cortex remains on both blade surfaces
indicating the resource pebble had the same thickness as
the finished projectile point, and was nearly the same width
and length. This category resembles the Kent type, a group
widely varying in its details of form that was in extensive use
during the Late Archaic.

Miscellaneous dart form 2
(Figure 21 f). The blade is asymmetrical but approximately
triangular. One edge is nearly straight, the other is convex;
shoulders are not pronounced. The stem appears to be slightly
expanding, with a slight concavity in the base, and comprises
about one-fourth of the total length of the artifact. Considerable cortex remains over one face of the specimen.

Miscellaneous dart tbrm 3
(Figure 21 g). The blade is roughly triangular, piano-convex in cross-section, and very asymmetrical. The distal blade
tip is missing and an upward sweeping shouldeffbarb is
developed only on one side. The stem is roughly straight
with a flat base. This form, too, resembles the Kent type.
Stemmed knife
(Figure 21h). The blade is roughly ovoid in outline and
does not appear to have been reworked from a dart point.
The stem is slightly expanded and the base is slightly convex. Cortex remains on both surfaces and on the distal end
indicating the tool was made from a resource pebble not
much larger than the final artifact form. There is wear and
polish on both edges as indicated in Figure 2lb.
Elongate biface tool
(Figure 21i) This is a roughly chipped tool exhibiting
slight wear and polish on the distal end and slight wear on
the lateral edges (indicated on Figure 21i). The presumed
proximal end is flat and unmodified.
Small bithce cutting tool
(Figure 21j). This is a small, leaf-shaped interior flake
that has tiny use-retouch flaking or nibbling along the lateral edges (indicated on Figure 2 l j) and a small, graverqike
point at the distal end. Examination at up to 43x indicates
little wear of edges and no striations indicating patterned
use; however, there is abrasion wear on prominent ridges
between flake scars on the two faces. This tool was made on
a thin flake with primarily unifacial edge trimming on alternate sides of the flake resembling beveling.
Indeterminate biface fragments
Three biface fragments could not be identified as to
their original tool type, but add some information to the
lithic technology used at Gaulding. From lot 41 (lower half of
the upper stratigraphic analysis unit) was the small fragment
of an ovoid or rounded biface that had broken either in manufacture or in use along a quartz vein that cuts across the
material and obviously was a plane of weakness. From lot 60
(lower analysis unit) comes a fragment of which not enough
remains to measure or to determine much about its form. Part
of it includes an unmodified cortex surface, and the entire
piece, including the break facet shows much abrasion and
polish. From lot 93 (no stratigraphic provenience) was a piece
that could be stem of a hafted tool. It has slightly contracting sides and a convex base.

Used flake
(Figure 2 lk). This convenience tool is an irregular secondary cortex chert flake that exhibits much wear around
half of its circumference and polish within 2 mm of that edge.

Also there is wear on the elevated areas of the dorsal and
ventral surfaces.
Bipolar (?) core
(Figure 211). This is the fragment of a pebble that shows
percussion fiâactures on one end of the long side of the
pebble and has what appear to be rebound fractures and
flakes on the opposite end.
Discarded core pebble

heavy piece of quartzite does not show; for example, it is not
pitted as if used as an anvil in bipolar lithic technology.
Neither is it battered as if it had been used as a hammerstone.
Grinding slabs like this have been found in east Texas, from
where the fragment may have been brought or traded into
the coastal area.

Punfice
A small piece 01! apparently unmodified pumice, approximately 30 by 30 by 20 mm, was l:bund in the surface collection.

This is a chert pebble on which much of the cortex remains but several flakes have been removed apparently in a
failed attempt at making a core tool of some sort.

Debitage
From several sources (excavation, bulk samples, tâaunal
samples) a small collection of 33 lithic flakes was assembled.
They represent most of the flake types produced by manufacturing small biface tools except for small flakes produced
during periodic resharpening. The evidence from the tools
described above indicates that very often they were manufactured from small pebbles and cobbles that were barely
larger than the finished implement. In this situation, it is not
likely that a great many flakes would be produced, at least
not many flakes large enough to have been recovered in the
Gaulding excavations.
Metate fragment
(Figure 22f-fâ). This is an unusual artifact with a complex history. It is a purplish brown (Munsell color was inadvertently not recorded) quartzitic sandstone that once was a
lmâge metate manufactured somewhere other than the Sabine
Lake area. The metate had been broken and in its Gaulding
incarnation was a piece that was roughly 100 by 64 by 32 mm
and weighed 394 grams. The upper and lower surfaces, which
can be seen in Figure 22, clearly show the original grinding
facets, but its use at Gaulding was different. The piece has
wear and rounding on all of the edges and breaks indicating
it had been carried about or handled for quite some time after
the metate was broken. Overlying the metate grinding facets
along several of the edges are narrow grooves (Figure 22f).
The latter are oriented perpendicularly to the edges. Some
are V-shaped and relatively deep, considering this is a very
hard rock. Others are U-shaped and are not so deep. The
use(s) to which this ex-metate fragment was placed is/are
speculative, but the grooves suggest it may have been tied
to something perhaps as a weight, and/or used to rub or
strop a cord or leather thong to improve its flexibility. Larry
Banks examined the piece; he did not recognize the rock as
to its source formation, but believed it was not Catahoula
quartzite (L. Banks, personal communication, 1996). He also
suggested as a possible function that the edge grooving
might have resulted from edge preparation of stone bifaces
before sharpening. Equally significant may be what this

Discussion
The majority of all provenienced lithic materials were
fiâom the upper half of the upper stratigraphic analysis unit,
the location of nearly all the pottery as well. None of the
chipped stone artifacts was very large; indeed, all are within
the maximum dimensiou range previously suggested for
small core tools made fiâom alligator gastroliths (Aten
1983b:Appendix B). Perhaps t\~rther reinforcing this association is that the faunal collection from Gaulding site, to
be described later, shows a major increase in alligator remains in the upper analysis unit, coincident with the major
increase in lithic tools and debitage. The functional tool
types are not remarkable, being typical of sites in the area.
The most extensive analysis of projectile points conducted
nearest to the Gaulding site was at the Eagleâs Ridge site
on the lower Trinity River (Ensor 1997). Generally, they
found that Early and Middle Archaic forms were better
made, employed higher quality lithic materials, and were
obtained from greater distances than Late Archaic dart
points, a pattern common in east Texas. The Late Archaic
points tended to be made from local stream gravels (cherts,
silicified wood, and quartzite), and usually were small in
size. The resulting tools are often irregular and asymmetrical in form making typological analysis somewhat uncertain. While at Gaulding there is no early material for comparison, the Eagleâs Ridge observations on Late Archaic
dart points and associated stemmed tools are much like the
situation at Gaulding.
Although not all of the Archaic stemmed tool forms are
projectile points, it is interesting to note that all of the stems
have similar widths and thicknesses (Table 8), possibly suggesting a standard technique and size for hafting and shafts
during the Late Archaic. It also may be notable that in the
upper analysis unit, when most artifacts and faunal remains
were increasing in their abundance, only two arrow points
were found.
The materials used in the Gaulding lithic technology,
although few in number, are generally similar to the proportions previously described for the ceramic using time period
in the Sabine Lake mâea (Aten 1983b:301); i.e., primmâily cherts
with small but persistent use of silicified wood and quartzite.
So few specimens were recovered from the earlier Late Archaic layers it is hard to say much about them.

BONE ARTIFACTS
Socketed bone points

with the analysis units.
Antler tine

(Figure 22a-b). These are two nearly identical socketed
bone projectile points; one is fiâom the middle analysis unit
(lot 115, Figure 22a), aud the other cannot be assigned to an
analysis unit (lots 73 and 103, Figure 22b). Both are made
from deer cannon bone and are of the long type. The specimen from lot 115 (Figure 22a) is 94.2 mm long and even though
the base is broken, this probably is its original maximum
length. The other specimen is 95.5 mm long but part of the
base is missing which probably would have added another 5
mm at least to this specimenâs maximum length. The distal tip
from one is undamaged; the other is slightly broken but
shows wear from continued use. Both have broken socket
bases, which presumably is the reason for them to have
been discarded.

(Figure 22c). Also of unclear provenience, this antler
tine has a highly polished distal tip, a condition that occurs
naturally (D. A. Story, personal communication, 1996). Its
presence in the site suggests some kind of use, but there is
not much wear on the distal tip indicative of a flaking tool. In
its present form, with a broken proximal end, the tine is 81.9
mm long.
SHELL ARTIFACTS
Unfinished columella bead (?)
(Figure 22e). This is a piece of a large conch columella
ground around its circumference and on the ends. The piece
is 29.5 mm long and roughly 13 mm in diameter. It has not

broken, it was originally shaped, or developed through use,

Alternatively, this piece may have been used as is, for what-

upper analysis unit.

as if this bone was being used for an anvil for cutting something. In form, this specimen is the same as Type I from the
Harris County Boys School (Aten et al. 1976: Figure 12E).
Splinter awl
(Figure 21m-n). These two specimens are splinters of
long bones from large, deer-sized, mammals that have been
shaped into a point and show polish around their distal
tips. One specimen (lot 103; Figure 21m) is from the upper
half of the upper analysis unit. A few mm of the distal tip is

Perl[brated Rangia cuneata valves
(Figure 22d). A number of Rangia cuneam valves were
saved from the sorting screens because they had holes
perforating the shells and were presumed to been tied together and used as weights (cf., Neyland and Worthington
1962). Inspection showed that many of them were perforated for other reasons: some had fiâesh breaks, some were
holes drilled by natural predators, others were broken

analysis unit, two were found in the lower analysis unit

also (Table 7).

CHAPTER

OTHER CULTURAL EVIDENCE

SUBSISTENCE
One of the drawbacks of the subsistence data from
Gaulding is that the shellfish cannot be quantitatively integrated with the vertebrate data. That is to say, it cannot be
determined how much shellfish meat per unit weight corresponds to a unit weight of vertebrate meat. Nevertheless,
there are a number of things that can be said about each
separately. Also, since there is no information on the plant
component of Gaulding subsistence, the basic questions about
the big picture of subsistence--plants versus vertebrates
versus shellfish-and why, go unanswered at this time.
Shellfish
The Gaulding site shellfish were overwhelmingly, but
not entirely, Rangia cuneata, a clam that reproduces in very
!ow salinity upper estuarine conditions. As larvae, R. cuneata
can be swept into fresh water or into high salinity water and
survive, although these transported populations do not reproduce (Hopkins et al. 1973:17-21). Discussion was offered
earlier about whether the Rangia was all harvested and
opened as food for the moment, or were they used for some
other purpose. It is assumed here that most of them were
consumed on the spot but, for example, given the abundance of garfish and alligator bones in the site, it is not farfetched to assume that some quantity of the opened shellfish meat was used as bait.
Earlier, data also were presented from the bulk samples
on the mean size of the clams in the various layers. Clams in
Layers 2 through 5 were quite small, containing very little
meat per individual, while those in the succeeding layers are
a little larger. The shell samples available from the 1965 field
school excavation also indicate the same relationship. Unfortunately, the bulk samples do not really tell how many
clams were harvested in relation to vertebrates taken. One
has to wonder why such small clams, containing only 1 to 2
grams of wet meat each, were worth the effort; but clearly
they were.

65

It was speculated, in the field school field notes, about
whether the small clams were dwarfed and, if so, why. However, after comparing their lengths to the annual growth intenâuptions on the shells and comparing these to modern
known-age samples, it is evident that the small clams were
just young individuals--usually in their second or third year
- and of normal size (Aten 1999). Presumably they are all
that was available to be collected. Alternatively, these layers
may represent "hard times" subsistence. It is odd, however,
that such small clams would have persisted as the available
resource through the period of deposition of the four successive layers of the Lower Analysis Unit unless, hidden by
the range of radiocarbon standard deviations, was a very
rapid accumulation of cultural debris.
An opportunity was presented to examine the longterm presence of the Rangia cuneata clam in the Taylor
Bayou drainage basin. The Corps of Engineers Galveston
District made a large number of engineering logs available
from borings that had been drilled in the Hillebrandt and
lower Taylor bayous not far from the Gaulding site. In addition to the geological and sedimentological data, they also
contained notations about the presence of "shells." While
some of these may not have been Rangia, it is assumed that
the majority was. From the 56 boring logs taken in the middle
basin, 171 shell occurrences were logged and their depth
recorded (Figure 23). Shells were relatively infrequent in the
deeper cores (up to 26 feet, or 8 m) and they gradually increased in abundance until a peak was reached around 10 to
12 feet (3-3.6 m) depth. After this the frequency declined
rapidly to very few shells being recorded in the shallower
core depths.
This plot becomes even more interesting when it is associated with radiocarbon dates that approximate rising sea
level (Appendix C, Table C-4). These dates are from the Pleistocene-Holocene contact in Sabine Lake in the vicinity of
the buried early channel of Taylor Bayou (Anderson et al.
1991). The calibrated dates were plotted on Figure 23 as well.

Figure 23. Relative abnndance of shells (primarily Rangia cuneata) with depth below mean sea level in the middle reacbes of Taylor and
Hillebrandt Bayons. Radiocarbon dates are from Anderson et al. 199t (see Appendix C, tbis report).

The period of maximum Rangia cuneata occurrence coincides with the Lower and Middle Analysis Units at Gaulding,
as well as two other dated Late Archaic components nearby
(cf. Figure 9). The Upper Analysis Unit at Gaulding and the
dated upper component at 41JF11 (Raab and Smith 1983)
coincide with the later period when Rangia cuneata was
drastically reduced in abundance.
Taken together, these observations suggest that the
period from roughly 2,000 to 4,000 years ago was the optimum period in the Taylor Bayou drainage basin for shellfish
harvesting. This does not mean necessarily that clams were
absolutely abundant at this time, but were as numerous as
they ever were to be. Subsequent to 2,000 years ago, clams
in Taylor/Hillebrandt Bayou were scarce on the whole and
may not always have been available for harvest. Some of the
dated archeological components from this latter time, though,
are fairly substantial deposits. So the conditions in Taylor
and Hillebrandt bayous must have been that periodically
Rangia cuneata larvae were swept upstream from Sabine
Lake or lower Tay!or Bayou and they settled to form large
but non-reproducing populations in the freshwater habitats

of the middle Taylor Bayou drainage basin. These would
persist until all had been harvested, or had died of natural
causes - not longer than about 10 years in the northern Gulf
coast (Aten 1999) - or were replenished by the next episode
of drought or storm surge that would sweep a new supply of
larvae upstream. Although a barrier was constructed early in
this century on lower Taylor Bayou to prevent upstream
intrusions of salt water, such intrusions were a rare event
until construction of the Port Arthur Canal and heavy new
demands for irrigation water from Taylor and Hillebrandt
Bayous diminished the fresh water outflow (Alpefin 1977:75).
The other shellfish species presumably used as a subsistence item at Gaulding was the eastern oyster, Crassostrea
virginica. Although a number of oyster shells were recovered (Table 9), they still contributed an exceedingly small
proportion of shellfish meat in relation to the Rangia and
much of their value to this investigation is in terms of their
information about shellfish source areas.
The greatest number of oyster shells that are in the
collection came from the Lower Analysis Unit in the early
Late Archaic. Their abundance seems to have declined s!owly

from that time. Plots of the shell sizes indicate considerable
variation in sizes collected with no clear trend (Figure 24).
Lower Analysis Unit shells ranged widely from small to large.
Middle Analysis Unit shells were consistently small. The
lower half of the Upper Analysis Unit again ranged widely
from small to large, while the upper half of the Upper Analysis Unit was consistently large shellfish. Roughly 20 to 25
percent of the valves had the distal ends broken off (Table 9)
perhaps suggesting how at least some of the oysters were
opened.
The frequency distribution of the height/width ratio of
oyster shells as well as certain shell form features indicates
the habitat in which the shellfish grew. The plot of oyster
height/width ratios shows a strong peak in the 1.1 to 1.7
range indicating a predominance of rounded shells rather
than elongate ones (Figure 25). Oysters with these forms
typically grow either singly or in loose clusters on muddy
sand substrates (Kent 1988:30). Moreover, some 10 to 25
percent of the oyster shells in this collection have developed radial ribs (Table 9), a feature typical of intertidal or
shallow water growth. Nearly all of the oyster shells were
infested with the Polydora mudworm (Table 9), a very low
salinity animal that takes up symbiotic residence in the living oyster (Hofstetter 1967:19). There was no indication of
higher salinity estuarine predators. There were, however, a
fairly large number of lower oyster valves that had set on
shells ofRangia cuneata molding their early shell formation
to the shape of the clam shell and, in many cases, permanently incorporating the Rangia valve into the oyster shell.

In summary, the Gaulding site oysters had been growing in areas recently inhabited by Rangia cuneata, were
infested with mudworms but not higher salinity predators,
and grew in shallow water in small clumps or as individuals.
Taken together, this information on oyster shells suggests
that they were collected farther downstream from Gaulding,
possibly in shallow marginal waters of lower Sabine Lake
but did not originate in reefs or deeper parts of the estuary.
Vertebrates
Nearly 2,600 identifiable animal bones were recovered
from the ~/z- and ~-inch (15.2 and 7.6 mm) screens used during the 1965 and 1974 excavations. Billy M. Davidson analyzed the former collection and Laura J. Froehlich analyzed
the latter. Because the sampling at the site was done without
any 2-mm screening - hardly anyone did this in 1965 - we
must assume there is an undefined degree of bias against
smal! animals in the dataset. In addition, the faunal sample
originates from several small, disconnected excavation units
that often cannot be associated with specific layers. The
only practical approach is to synthesize all excavation unit
samples into the large-scale chronostratigraphic analysis
units with which they are associated. These characteristics
of the fauna! data also make using estimated minimum numbers of individuals unrealistic. The number of identified specimens (NISP) approach is used instead. Although this approach introduces distortions of its own, it has the benefit
of staying close to the data, and it produces a set of relationships between species that in some manner reflects cultural

differences in how food resources are taken from the landscape.
The condition of the bones in the faunal collection also
should be noted. The bones and fragments usually are small
(10-60 mm long), with most being in the small end of that
range. These generally are unaltered except for having been
broken. But a small proportion retains butchering evidence
in the form of cutting and scraping marks. Another small
group of bones are smoothed and polished, but are not
shaped into a utilitarian or ornamental form. These seem
likely candidates for having passed through the gastrointestinal tract of a larger animal, such as an alligator. Since alligator remains were found frequently in the site, this is a plausible explanation. It also indicates that faunal analysis of a
better-defined collection than we have from Gaulding should
look closely at bone condition and discount those that may
only accidentally be in the site as residue from butchering
other animals.
There are three key elements to the faunal analysis given
here. The NISP and the stratigraphic analysis units have
been introduced previously. The third element is the "animal
class." This approach has been used for organizing still unpublished, as well as published, faunal data from the lower
Trinity River (cf., Aten 1983a; Dillehay ! 975). The original
idea was obtained from Thomas (1969:392ff) who used animal classes to partition a faunal sample into groups of mammals of progressively larger body size to evaluate the effectiveness of certain archeo!ogical recovery techniques. In
the adaptation of such an approach on the northern Gulf,
animal classes are used to divide the entire archeological
fauna into categories describing general body size and life
style such as "aquatic," "small terrestrial," and so on. These
groups of animals that are found by the Indian hunter or
gatherer may have been subject to more or less similar acquisition techniques.
The species and number of identified specimens that
were found in each stratigraphic analysis unit is given according to conventional taxonomic categories in Table 10;
the same data organized according to animal classes is presented in Table 11. Because of the different volumes of excavated shell deposits assignable to each of the stratigraphic
analysis units, the total number of identified bones per cubic foot (per .03 cubic meter) is given at the bottom of Table
11. Here it can be seen that the density of bones in the Lower
and Middle Analysis Units (i.e., early and middle Late Archaic) is small compared to the Upper Analysis Unit. This
does not appear to be a preservation problem since in northern Gulf shel!-bearing sites, bone preservation usually is
adequate and, as noted above, the Gaulding bones generally were in good condition except for breakage.
Discussion
As noted earlier the relationship between vertebrate
and invertebrate fauna is significant here. Unfortunately,
the data available only allow quantitatively considering shell-

69

fish and vertebrates separately. Despite the different sizes
of Rangia cuneata clams in successive layers, and disregarding both the possibility that not all the harvested clams
were used for human consumption and that these inferences
are based on only one series of bulk samples, the estimated
clam meat weight per unit of site volume was roughly the
same for each layer. So even though it cannot be determined
how much clam meat contributed to subsistence relative to
the contribution of vertebrate animals, it appears that in the
Late Archaic it was a declining proportion, as the vertebrate
bone density in the site slowly increased (cf., Figure 14c and
Table 14). Then, with the onset of the ceramics-using periods, a significant increase in use of vertebrate meat occurred,
presumably causing the relative proportion of dietary contribution from harvested clam meat to decline further.
The proportional structure of faunal subsistence in each
stratigraphic analysis unit (A.U.) can be seen in Figure 26. In
the early Late Archaic (Lower A.U.) there tends to be relatively more avian and terrestrial animals and relatively fewer
aquatic animals. In the Middle A.U., there is a proportional
increase in fish apparently at the expense of the terrestrials
that were more dominant in the Lower A.U. In the Upper (B)
A.U., hunting large terrestrials and small terrestrial-aquatics
continues to decline while the proportion of fish increases
sharply. Finally, in the Upper (A) A.U., the proportion of large
animal hunting continues to decline while the relative use of
aquatic animals, especially alligators, continues to increase.
Despite the changes in relative proportions of the animal classes in the four analysis unit samples, the abundance
of bones from each animal class (i.e., density per cubic foot,
or per .03 cubic meter) tells a different story of how abundant the animals actually were (Figure 27). In the Lower and
Middle A.U.âs, there is a very low density of bones from all
animal classes, although several classes--especially the
aquatic animals--show a tendency to increase in the Middle
A.U. The two parts of the Upper A.U. are significantly different. Upper (B) shows major increases in quantity of large
terrestrials (mainly deer) even though their relative proportion is declining. There are even larger increases in fish, with
definite but smaller increases in large and small terrestrialaquatics. Upper (A) A.U. again shows increases in large
terrestrials with even greater increases in large terrestrialaquatics and fish.
All in all, and assuming there is not a major undetected
bone preservation problem, the faunal data show a major change
in the focus of subsistence from the early Late Archaic to the
Late Prehistoric ceramics-using periods. Within the context of
the particular portion of the local settlement pattern represented
by sites in the Taylor Bayou drainage basin, there is a progressive and proportional increase overall in the use of vertebrates
versus shellfish. And within the vertebrates, there is a shift
from predominantly using terrestrial and avian vertebrates to
using aquatic and terrestrial-aquatic animals. Several investigators have described a similar phenomenon for the central Texas
coast (e.g., Hall 1998:3-4).

Additional observations can be made about this faunal
collection. Along with the increase through time in quantity
of identified bones of the white-tailed deer, it appears that
this increase was focused upon taking old deer rather than
young or adult deer. The fish in this fauna are all freshwater
or very !ow salinity species that presumably reflects the
prevailing aquatic habitat in the middle Taylor Bayou drainage basin. And the most unusual of the animals present is
the green sea turtle, Chelonia mydas, a marine species whose
females only come ashore to lay eggs on the beach in spring.

This is not an occurrence that can be rationalized for Taylor
Bayou. In fact, there is a pattern of evidence (the sea turtle,
oysters harvested from downstream, collection of Busycon
and Dinocardium shells) suggesting that while people were
living at Gaulding, watercraft were in use (cf., Barroto
1987:178-179, for description of Atakapa using canoes in
1686). On occasion these must have been used to make excursions downstream, sometimes as fax" as the Lake and even
to the Gulf shores, nearly 50 km distant, returning with food
items and resource materials.

THE GAULDING BURIAL
The interment of a single individual was discovered
at the bottom of the shell deposit in the exploratory trench
between excavation units A-5 and A-7, and extending into
unit A-10 (Figure 4). Since the body was placed directly
on the acidic silty clay of the Beaumont Formation and
was surrounded by the relatively sparse shell deposit of
Layer 10, the skeletal remains were fragile. R. M. Malina
and A1 B. Wesolowsky examined the remains and their
notes were the basis for part of this section. Although
photographs and drawings were made at the time of discovery, these are on file at TARL and are intentionally not
included here.

lowed the slope of the clay surface for a short distance resulting in a steeply sloping bottom.
This mortuary excavation went entirely through the
uppermost site stratum, Layer 10 (also called Zone A at the
time of the field school excavation), and slightly into the
underlying basal silty clay. Since Layer 10 consists of a dark
matrix and only moderate amounts of Rangia clam shell, no
pit fill was distinguished. Presumably the grave fill was the
same material removed when digging the hole. Consequently
it was not possible to determine from what elevation in Layer
10 the pit originated. However, because Layer 10 in this part
of the site is the principal location of ceramics (Figure 19),
the burial pit dates to sometime during, or later than, the
ceramic occupation of the site.

Burial pit
As described earlier, the Beaumont Formation surface
underlying the Gaulding site is gullied and irregular causing
the shell deposit to be quite thin in places (see Figure 6).
Apparently coincidentally, the burial pit was dug directly
over a rise in the silty clay subsurface and the pitâs maximum
depth ranged from only about 8 inches to 15 inches (20 to 38
cm) below the present ground level; the pit was only slightly
dug into the subsoil. Once the prehistoric people digging
the original burial pit had reached the yellow clay they fol-

Burial orientation
The burial was a primary inhumation of a single, articulated, human skeleton. The body was placed into the grave
while lying on its back with the legs drawn up tightly flexed.
The left arm was tightly flexed with the hand drawn up along
the left side of the head; the right arm was loosely drawn-up
with the hand in the individualâs lap. Because of the pitâs
steeply sloping floor, the body was coincidentally in an inclined or semi-sitting position that probably should not be

confused with an attempt at burial placement in a sitting
position.
The body was oriented N61E (magnetic) with the
head pointing to the easterly direction; itâs head was rotated
to face to the bodyâs right side. No grave goods were found
preserved with the body.
The individual
The skeleton was an adult female approximately 30-40
years of age at death, based on cranial suture closure and
dental attrition. The teeth have moderate wear and one cavity. Several lambdoidal ossicles were observed. Lipping of
the sacral alae (i.e., near the base of the spine) and slight
lipping of the elbow joint also were reported that presumably are due to arthritis.

cent than the early ceramic occupations.
Mortuary ritual apparently was not restricted to certain
age groups or by adult sexes; al! ages and sexes seem to
be represented.
No dramatic pathology was seen; only minor arthritic
lipping, heavily worn teeth, and occasional cavities and
bone abscesses.
The majority of known individuals were oriented with
heads to the west, although the Gaulding burial is oriented to the east. The 41OR33 graves may have been
part of a cemetery. There is no information on orientation fl:om the Black Hill Mound.
Three apparent examples of artifacts placed in the grave
with the body (two columella beads, a small ceramic
vessel, and a turtle shell rattle) occurred at 41 OR33; no
artifacts, however, were found at the Gaulding site or
were reported at Black Hill Mound.

Many burials have been found by local collectors or
have been seen when sites were being demolished. However, the only local comparative data on mortuary practices
comes from notes on file at TARL that were made in 1956 by
E. M. Davis on several burials partially documented at 41OR33
while that shell deposit was being removed. Remains of an
estimated 13 individuals were recovered including all age
groups and both male and female adults. As at Gaulding,
these burials were relatively near the surface of the shell
deposit and appear to have been confined to one general
area. Where determinable, the bodies were oriented roughly
east-west with their heads placed to the westerly direction.
The four burials actually recorded while still partly in the
ground were all flexed. Three were positioned in a row suggesting this may have been a cemetery rather than isolated
occasional interments. A very late or protohistoric Caddoan
bottle accompanied one of the burials.
In addition, the remains of several individuals--possibly as many as 14--were collected in 1963 from the Black Hill
Mound (41JF24). This site was located not far from Gaulding
on the upper reaches of Hillebrandt Bayou, a tributary of
Taylor Bayou. There are no records of the mortuary practices, but there is some information available on the site. The
site itself is an earth midden with some Rangia cuneam
shell included. A collection of about 700 sherds has been
examined and while a little more than one-third of the sherds
are early ceramics--Tchefuncte and related varieties - the
remainder could extend much later in time. The skeleta! remains were highly fragmented by the time they were catalogued by TARL staff, and while the number of individuals
is a bit uncertain, there could be as many as 14 represented.
These included 2 infants, 3 subadults, and possibly 9 adults
(TARL records).
There are several points that can be inferred about
Sabine Lake area mortuary practices from Gaulding, Black
Hill Mound, and 41 OR33.
Â¯
All of the currently known burials are from relatively
late in the areaâs prehistory and probably are more re-

SEASON OF OCCUPNrlON
There is little that can be said about seasonality with
the data currently available. The method of evaluating
Rangia cuneata shell morphology (Aten 1981) has been retested against new long-term samples and was found to be
unsuccessful in estimating season of collection (Aten 1999);
this method is no !onger recommended for use. The only
ethnohistoric information available places Atakapa Indians
in a settlement containing a number of huts not far upstream
fiâom the mouth of Sabine Pass in mid-April 1686 (Barroto
1987:178-179). Archeologically, there are some indications
of season from the small collection of oyster shells, but primarily it is necessary to fall back on the general indications
of the vertebrate fauna. The best information is for the Upper Analysis Unit fiâom which the greatest number of species
was recognized (Table 10). Among the fish, most are present
year round, although the sheepshead moves offshore once
the estuarine waters become too cold. The birds are essentially all year round inhabitants (Peterson 1980). The reptiles, of which there are many, are generally scarce to absent
in cold weather (Neill 1971:270-27 !). Their abundance in the
archeological fauna is a strong indicator of habitation during warm seasons of the year. The sea turtle, however, is
seasonally specific, with the females coming ashore to lay
eggs only from April through June (Cart 1984:116). The majority of the mammals present are active year round (Davis,
W. B. 1966).
A method for evaluating seasonality from the ligament
groove of oyster shells has recently come into some use
(Cox 1994; Kent 1988). Applying this to the oyster lower
valves from Gaulding (Table 9) suggests the principal time
of occupation in the Lower Analysis Unit was from the winter to spring. The Middle Analysis Unit oysters were collected mostly in the spring. The Upper Analysis Unit oysters were apparently collected in the winter and spring. Almost none of the shells indicated collection in the summer
and few in the fall.

Chapter 4: Other Cultural Evidence

Taken together, there is an indication that during the
time of all three Analysis Units, Gaulding was used at least
during some or all of the winter through spring period. It
may have been used at other parts of the year as well. Of
course, the winters in the Sabine Lake area are not uniformly
cold (cf., "Sabine Lake area landscape" earlier in this report)
and alligators have been observed to be active in southwest
Louisiana marshes in late January in recent years (Aten,
field notes). So, while none of the vertebrates conclusively
points to the cold seasons of year, the numerous species
present that are active year round could mean that habitation occurred in the winter months as well as the spring.
REGIONAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS
Gauldingâs place in prehistoric use of this stream system may be illuminated by a review of what is known of
adjacent settlements. Numerous reconnaissance surveys
have been carried out in the Sabine Lake area, at least for
shel!-bearing sites. Thus far 145 have been found (TARL
records) and, because of the extensive areas that have been
covered, in most instances repeatedly, it seems certain that
the large numbers of sites found in the Galveston Bay area,
for example, will not be replicated in the Sabine.
In the Taylor Bayou drainage basin part of the Sabine,
surveying has identified 18 sites, including Gaulding, located along some 41-stream km throughout the basin (Table
12; Aten 1972; TARL records). Most of these sites are modest in size but contain a minimum of 21 distinct culture-historical units, or components. All but one of the known Taylor Bayou basin sites and components are shell-bearing
(Table 12). In the extreme upper reaches of Hi llebrandt Bayou
is the remnant of an earth midden with small amounts of
shell included, it was an early ceramics-using habitation site
subsequently used as a mortuary locality.
Most sites (18) in the basin are on or very near the
Pleistocene uplands surfaces; only 3 were located in the
marsh without higher ground nearby. In some cases, sites at
the edge of the uplands face on or are overlapped to some
extent by marsh, and their orientations suggest they are not
associated with the present stream channel (e.g., Pearson et
al. 1982:23-26). Seven sites or components have >30 cm of
deposit; those remaining are thinner. Nine of the sites are
partly or entirely below the present bayou water level. Most
of the sites (14) have a substantial overburden of dark gray
silty/clayey marsh deposits. Nine preceramic components
are known or are probable and more could be present. Twelve
sites have ceramic components--two-thirds of these are thin
deposits (<30 cm) and at least one of the remaining ceramic
components (i.e., Gaulding) is only a superficial layer at the
top of thick preceramic shell deposits.
Of all these sites, Gaulding is the largest known in the
Taylor Bayou drainage basin. Compared to shell sites elsewhere in the Sabine, though, it is only of modest size. And
there are three other shell-bearing sites in the Taylor Bayou
basin that may be comparable in size to Gaulding, although

75

testing has not been done to confirm this. As best we can
determine at this time, there is one, and perhaps four, modest-sized shell sites surrounded by 13 smaller sites. Recalling the "Sabine Lake area landscape" discussion at the beginning of this report, it was noted that the Taylor Bayou
basin vegetation and geomorphology could be divided into
three parts and that the shell-bearing sites were confined to
the middle basin. This middle basin extends for about 22
stream-km and has a linear site density of.62 sites/km. Such
a site density seems unusually low and, for comparison,
similar statistics were compiled for elsewhere in the Sabine
region.
The portion of the lower Neches River which contains
shell sites has a minimum (because some sites were destroyed
before surveys recorded their locations) linear density of
1.41 sites/km. The lower Sabine River has a linear density of
1.45 sitesikm. And the densely occupied north shore of Sabine
Lake--the section between the two river mouths--has a
linear density of 1.47 sites/km. Even the coastal marsh behind the Gulf beaches, as typified by the Sea Rim Park area,
has a linear or shoreline site density of 1 site/km. As shell
site distributions go in the Sabine Lake area, that of the
Taylor Bayou drainage basin is sparse. Although there are
gaps in the testing data, the current indication is that prehistoric use of the Taylor Bayou basin was at its maximum in the
Late Archaic or earlier Late Prehistoric. The ceramic-bearing
shell sites or components are small and suggest the basin
was used only intermittently then, and for brief occupations.
One process that went on concurrently with the decline
in prehistoric use of the basin was the continuing slow rise
of sea level to its contemporary elevation. Rising base level
filled the incised stream valley and spilled out to create
marshes in the lower and middle basin, and swamps in the
upper basin, a phenomenon that is clearer on the 1915
Jefferson County soils map (Carter et al. 1915) than on more
recent maps. Whether this landscape evolution impeded
access or reduced habitats and resource availability is not
clear, but the progressive watering of the basin seems more
than coincidentally related to its progressive disuse by native shellfish collectors.
The role of the Taylor Bayou drainage basin in the regional activities of the Western Atakapa is an issue that
remains to be shown. The upland prairies, into which the
Taylor Bayou basin extends, are not noted for any abundance of archeologica! sites, although it is certain that the
prairies and woodland margins were traversed and prairie
resources exploited (Neyland 1970; Folmer 1940:218-220).
Systematic surveys of floodplain and uplands were conducted along Cypress Creek, north of Houston, which indicated that 96 percent of the sites were along the floodplain
and the remaining 4 percent were on the uplands (Moore
1995:141). Taken together, there is no evidence at this time
contradicting the idea that, in the upper Texas coast area,
most Indian life was carried out along the major streams with
the interfluves only visited rather than occupied. It seems

likely that what habitation there was in the Taylor Bayou
basin was so meager as to not represent the comprehensive
remains of any social group. Rather, these sites along with
other peripheral areas such as Sabine Pass and the Gulf

beaches most likely represent transient visitation by groups
based elsewhere--probably on the Neches or Sabine River
floodplains where historic era native villages were reported
(Bolton 1970:334).

CHAPTER 5

PALEOENVIRONMENT

PALEOCLIMAI~
Paleoclimate at the Gaulding site is inferred from the
abundance and habitat associations of the terrestrial snail
fauna given in Appendixes E and F (also see Figure 28).
Layers 2, 3, and 4 (early Lower Analysis Unit) may represent
a waning dry period (dry summers and cold winters). Layer 5
(late Lower Analysis Unit) represents the onset of a warmer,
moister period with expanded riparian woodlands that continued into Layers 6 through 8 (the Middle Analysis Unit).
There is a suggestion that during Layers 9 (the terminal
Middle Analysis Unit) and 10 (lower) conditions were somewhat drier, with expanded grasslands but still with a relatively large snail population. By the time of the Layer 10
(upper) bulk sample (upper half of the Upper Analysis Unit),
essentially modern climate was becoming established - a
time of mild temperatures and increased annual rainfall.
These conditions and shifts are broadly consistent with
regional climate patterns that have been reported for the
Middle Holocene. Altithermal conditions have been widely
documented in Texas (e.g., Nordt et al. 1994) and the Gaulding
site Lower Analysis Unit may reflect the final phase of that
episode and the shift to wetter conditions in the 3700 to 4000
B.R (conventional age) period. These latter conditions persisted in central Texas until around 2900 B.R (conventional
age) when a somewhat drier regime may have occurred (cf.,
Nordt et al. 1994:Figure 4) that also may be reflected in Layers 9 and 10 (lower). However, by circa 2000 B.R (conventional age), modern conditions of temperature and precipitation were being established as seen at Gaulding in the snai!
fauna of Layer 10 (upper).

drainage basin has other features suggesting the paleogeographic story has not been fully uncovered.
For example, it seems as if there are too few archeological sites in the basin, as was noted earlier when discussing
regional settlement patterns. The stream courses of Taylor
Bayou and its major tributaries have been repeatedly examined and so insufficient survey does not seem the answer,
unless it has not been looking in the right places. In this
regard, it may be notable that one shell site (41JF60) was
found rather coincidentally at the 5-foot (1.5 m) contour some
300 meters back from the bayou channel (Pearson et al.
1982:23-26). Another site, 41JF24, contains only small
amounts of shell, and is at the 10-foot (3 m) contour in the
upper drainage basin (Heartfield n.d.). These instances suggest that survey should be extended along the outside edge
of the floodplain where Pleistocene uplands meet the floodplain marsh.
Another peculiarity is that there is no evidence of habitation in the drainage basin after roughly 1300 A.D. and
most of the ceramic period components that are present prior
to that time seem to be sparse accumulations. Likewise it is
odd that the orientation of the Gaulding site shell ridge does
not conform to the present bayou channel. This is true also
at 41JF34 and 41JF54. Then there was the colluvial erosion
that occurred all along the "front," or bayou side, of the
Gaulding shell ridge and at a higher elevation than the present
bayou. Also, the apparent centers of shell accumulation at
Gaulding are away from the present bayou during the Lower
and Middle Analysis Units while cultura! accumulation during the Upper Analysis Unit does face the bayou.
And it is especially odd that nearly all of the sites have
a thick layer of sediment overburden (Table 12). This not
only includes sites that are near or below todayâs bayou
level, but sites having elevations up to 5 feet (1.5 m) or more
such as Gaulding (41JF27), 41JF54, 41JF60, 41JF34, and
41JF35. There is no information available on how high the
Tay!or Bayou basin floods during contemporary storm surges

PALEOGEOGRAPHY
As the long-term trend of sea level rose to its present
elevation in the Sabine Lake estuary and its !ocal tributaries,
broad wetlands were created in the Taylor Bayou drainage
basin and all or part of not quite half of the sites (Table 12)
were drowned. But the landscape and archeology in the

or excessive rainfall, but normal floodplain aggradation does
not seem an adequate explanation for this apparent blanket
of sediment at higher elevations. The Taylor Bayou drainage system is not a major river drawing from a large interior
basin that during floods adds much sediment to its floodplain and sustains peak flow for extended periods.
Before agriculture began on the nearby uplands, the
Taylor Bayou sedimentation model probably included sediment derived from up-basin headward erosion, and sediment eroded from the peripheral Pleistocene uplands some
of which can be seen accumulated behind the Gaulding shell
ridge (Figure 5). The latter sediment, in particular, ordinarily
would become trapped in the fringing marshes and in the
ponded or slow moving water. This contributes to expansion of the marshes and development of the organic character of the overburden deposits, as well as filling the entrenched stream channel. This process is slow and probably
means that organic sediment now stranded at higher elevations, including that blanketing elevated archeological sites,
may be attributable to extended periods of time during which
sea level, and the normal level of the bayou, was at a higher
elevation than at present. Furthermore, all of the other "peculiar" conditions mentioned above could be a consequence
of higher sea level as well. This is an unexpected inference
to have arrived at. Nevertheless, if there is a possibility of
recording short-term, low amplitude sea level changes in
relation to the archeological record, this should be examined

because of the importance of aligning the scales of culturalhistorical and environmental-historical information.
Most eustatic sea level curves in use for the northern
Gulf of Mexico are linear or curvilinear trends leading directly to the present level of the sea (Pirazzoli 1991 : 182-184).
However, recent investigations are identifying periods of
rapid sea level rise punctuated with stillstands or periods of
slow rise, leading to refinement of smooth sea level curves
into "step-wise" models; for a recent review of sea level
concepts pertaining to the northern Gulf of Mexico, see
Ricklis and Blum (1997). Of course, low amplitude (1-3 m)
fluctuations in Middle and Late Holocene sea level have
long been predicted or reported, perhaps most notably by
Fairbridge (1992, and in several preceding papers). However, their limited elevations make them difficult to identify
amongst the signatures of other coastal processes that operate over a similar or greater range of elevation. Moreover,
while higher-than-present Late Holocene sea level geomorphology has been found in many places, the key question to
resolve has been whether these high level features are due
to eustatic, isostatic, or other causes (Kidson 1986:52-54).
Eustasy versus other mechanisms is not an issue here; the
concern is relative sea level and how this impacted human
settlement in the Taylor Bayou basin.
Thus far, the principal field inquiries into higher-thanpresent sea levels in the northern Gulf have been carried out
on the central Texas coast (Paine 1991:71-139). There,

Chapter 5: Paleoenvironment

stranded estuarine fringing marshes, tidal flats, and dunes
were correlated with habitation at an archeological site. In
addition, Paine noted possible emerged tidal deltas, barrier
packets, and a shoreline berm al! as potential higher-thanpresent Holocene sea level features around East Bay, part of
the next estuary to the west from Sabine Lake. These are all
features at a similar spatial scale and chronological range to
those found in the Taylor Bayou drainage basin. Before focusing on higher sea level, though, the depositional sequence in Taylor Bayou will be examined and compared to
sea level evidence previously reported for the northern Gulf
coast west of the Mississippi River delta down-warped area.
There is nothing on Taylor Bayou geology in the literature except mapping of the incised stream valley (Kane 1959).
However, a series of deep cores that were taken at the State
Highway 73 bridge crossing of Taylor Bayou 8.2 km downstream from the Gaulding site was made available by the
Texas Department of Transportation. Because of the paucity of such information in the Sabine Lake area, this crosssection is included here (Figure 29). The stratigraphy in the
Highway 73 cross-section apparently consists of two "fining-upward" sequences indicating distinct, successive regimes of fluvial responses to a rising base (sea) level. The
greatest depth of entrenchment into the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation at this location was 24 m; from that depth a
succession of clayey silt/silty clay grades upward to gray
clays. At a depth of about 10 m the second sequence begins
with a gray clayey silt and quickly changes over to dark gray
organic clay. The calibrated Pleistocene-Holocene contact
dates from near the mouth of Taylor Bayou at Sabine Lake
(Anderson et al. 1991), described earlier for use in Figure 23,
are also plotted at the appropriate depth on the Highway 73
cross-section (Figure 29). These are seen to be included
entirely within the upper organic clay section and indicate
that the upper sequence began sometime prior to 6180 cal
B.P. (el. Appendix C).
The Taylor Bayou fill sequence is similar to sequences
identified elsewhere on the Texas coast. A two-phase rising
and stillstand sequence was identified in the San Jacinto
River drowned valley submerged in Galveston Bay (Kibler
et al. 1996:24-45). A.similar two-part sequence was documented on the Central Texas coast, although it has been
dated somewhat earlier (Ricklis and Blum 1997). And a higher
than present phase was reported for Copano Bay at approximately the same time as the second sti!lstand phase in
Galveston Bay (Prewitt and Paine 1987). The "big picture" of
rising base level and sedimentation in the entrenched Taylor
Bayou appears to be consistent with the emerging stepwise
sea level model for the northern Gulf coast. The two-phase
bayou filling sequence, the progressive watering of the basin as seen in the soils maps, and even the increase and
decrease in shells in the gray organic clay of the upper filling
sequence are all consequences of the overall trend of rising
sea level. But this does not account for the apparent high
level marsh-like deposits in the basin probably because there

79

is insufficient resolution in these indicators.
Although Paine (1991) identified some geomorphic features originating in a higher-than-present sea level period,
there is only one detailed Late Holocene sea level model
available for the Gulf of Mexico. For several years a body of
sea level measurements has been collected fiâom locations
around the Gulf of Mexico from southwest Florida toYucatan
(Mitchell-Tapping et al. 1996; Stapor et al. 1991; Tanner 1991,
1992). Most sea level methods are based on dating the relative elevation differences between sea level-related geomorphic features (such as strandlines and deltas) and present
sea level, and produce relatively few dated reference points.
The method applied by Tanner (1992) measures textural characteristics of sediments from numerous beach ridges within
distinct beach ridge packets. In numerous technical papers,
Tanner shows that kurtosis is a sensitive reflection of
changes in sea level, although not of their amplitude. This
method produces a much larger number of measurements
and, consequently, more detailed curves for given periods
of time. Since most beach ridges around the Gulf of Mexico
are less than 4000 years old, the resulting sea level model
applies only to the Late Holocene. The "Tanner curve" has
been applied and refined in studies in southwest Florida
(Mitchell-Tapping et al. 1996; Stapor et al. 1991), but has not
been studied much west of the Mississippi River. In any
event, the only approach available using literature sources
in the Gaulding and the Taylor Bayou basin case is to compare the consistency between the regional sea-level concept of the Tanner curve and datable geomorphic and archeological features from the southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana coast.
There are numerous papers applying or refining the
Tanner Late Holocene sea level model that often differ to
some degree. The general pattern of sea level rise and fall
used here (Figure 30) is synthesized from Tanner (1991, 1992,
1993) and Stapor et al. (1991) with some archeological confirmation from Marquardt (1996:27). To estimate the ages of
the change periods of rise or fall, Gunnâs replot (1997 :Figure
5) of Tannerâs data was used as well as the extensive radiocarbon dating by Stapor et al. (1991); see Appendix C for
calibration details. The informal time-stratigraphic terminology of the Caloosahatchie Bay version of the model (Stapor
et al. 1991) was used to label the individual events back to
about 2500 years ago (Figure 30). Earlier events are not
named, and for the present we have just labeled them "Tanner A," "Tanner B," and so on. The estimated amplitude of
each event was derived from Gunn (1997) and Stapor et al.
(1991). These should not be taken too seriously just yet,
although it does seem clear that the Wulfert event was when
sea level reached its highest level in the Late Holocene according to this model.
The mode! as used here (Figure 30) is plotted on a trend
line of long-term sea level rise approximated from the same
four Sabine Lake Pleistocene-Holocene boundary dates
(Anderson et al. 1991) that were described above. Because

the latter dates presumably represent submerged features
(natural shellfish beds) and were run on the shallow water
mollusc Rangia cuneata, the estimated long-term trend line
of the Holocene submergence is offset 1.5 m higher so that
the model curve elevations will better approximate the local
sea surface.
There are severa! dated northern Gulf coast geomorphological features that can be compared with the Tanner
Late Holocene sea level curve. If they are consistent, this
might be taken as a degree of verification and encourage a
search for further evidence. Beginning with the radiocarbon-dated archeological components in the Taylor Bayou
basin, they entirely or largely coincide with postulated high
sea level events (Figure 30). The age of the early Upper
Analysis Unit at Gaulding and of 41JF24, both estimated
from the presence of Tchefuncte and related pottery, is not
plotted because the time range over which these potentially
could date is anywhere from the middle "Tanner C" event to
the early Wulfert event. This range is too broad to be useful

McBride et al. (1997:41). After selecting the best understood
dates, they estimated the most likely age for four prominent
ridges. These were calibrated (Appendix C) and plotted (Figure 30). Three of the ridges plotted within or at the beginning of a high sea level event, an association with sea level
that seems appropriate for a transgressive feature. One ridge,
Chenier Perdue, plotted in the middle of a low sea level event,
a miscorrelation that cannot be explained with any certainty
here.
The majority (10 out of 12) of the datable events and
features in and near Taylor Bayou relate in an expectable
way to the possibility of a Late Holocene sea level curve like
that proposed by Tanner. Assuming, for the moment, that
the variable sea level curve (Figure 30) is a correct hypothesis, would its implications for the human settlement of the
Taylor Bayou drainage basin facilitate explaining any of the
unusual archeological site circumstances described earlier?

was calibrated and plotted (Figure 30; Appendix C). Except
for Stage 3, each channel stage begins with the onset of a
rising sea level event and continues on through the subse-

Similarly, the absence of cultural deposits coincides with
the times of the low sea level events when shellfish

the case during the Wulfert and LaCosta events, but it

and Stage 4 are really one and the same.
Just east of the Trinity River delta is a progradational

Lake Anahuac when it was still a part of Trinity Bay. These
ridges are of interest in part because some of them were
locations of a number of archeological shell sites. Many

would have made the Taylor Bayou basin the consistently freshwater environment that was described in
the 19â~ century. This would account for the diminished
frequency with which shellfish populations were established in the basin after about 2000 years ago (Figure

years ago it was possible to excavate a pit through the bottom of a destroyed archeological site (41CH9) that was located on the second ridge and to collect several Rangia
cuneata shells that predated formation of the ridge (Aten
1983b:278-279; also see Appendix C, this report). In addition, a small test excavation was dug in site 41CH137, also
located on the same ridge (Aten 1983b: 187-190). The basal
layers of 41CH 137 had ceramics typical of the middle Mayes
Island Period. The radiocarbon date from under the beach
ridge and the lower boundary age for the middle Mayes
Island Period were calibrated and used to bracket the likely
age of Turtle Bay beach ridge number 2 (Figure 30). The
resulting estimated age of this ridge plotted well within the
range of a high sea level event.
Finally, the cheniers of southwestern Louisiana invite
comparison to the sea level curve. Numerous radiocarbon
dates have been run on various cheniers over the years but
there are many problems with them as recently discussed by

The two rising sea level periods prior to about 2000
years ago would have increased the likelihood of Rangia
cuneata larvae being swept up into the lower and middle

23).
Â¯

Assuming the amplitudes for the "Tanner A" and "Tanner C" events are more or less right, the water level at
these times would not have spilled out of the entrenched
valley, at least in the middle and upper basin. So the
Lower and Middle Analysis Units and any other contemporaneous components at other sites would not be
expected to have any culturally sterile sediment either
incorporated within the shell deposits or as overburden
unless they continued to be exposed during the time of
the later high sea level events. This is at least partially
consistent with evidence at the Gaulding site. There is a
modest soil zone that began to develop in among the
shells of the top 10 cm or so of the site after deposition
of the Lower Analysis Unit. This was then covered,

Chapter 5: Paleoenvironment

Â¯

o

Â°

after several hundred years, by archeological shell refuse
of the Middle Analysis Unit. Except for Layers 2 and 3,
neither the Lower nor the Middle Analysis Units have
much sediment in the shell deposit. This is also the case
for the contemporaneous (stratum D) which, although
below present water level, had very little sediment in its
shell deposit.
The Wulfert high sea level event is generally documented as the highest of the high (e.g., Stapor et al.
1991). In the Taylor Bayou basin, this would be the
period when the middle basin would have been flooded
nearly to the 5 foot (1.5 m) contour creating the extensive blanket of marsh sediment that covers sites at higher
elevations as well as lower. This would have been the
time when what use of the basin there was, was probably relocated back from the bayou channel to positions like that occupied by 41JF60, near the 5 foot (1.5
m) contour. This also may be part of the explanation for
too few sites in the basin described earlier; perhaps
more sites will be found at this elevation.
The Wulfert or the subsequent LaCosta high sea level
event may be the time that the front of the Gaulding
shell ridge was being eroded at the waterâs edge with
displaced shell accumulating at the base of the erosional face (cf., Figure 5). These two events also may
have included periods of even more subtle vertical water level fluctuations which would leave the marsh blanket overlying Gaulding and other sites periodically exposed and dry, thus inviting the sparse shell deposits
that are found within the Upper Analysis Unit at the
Taylor Bayou end of the Gaulding shell ridge. The thick
mantle blanketing 41JF54, another nearby site that nearly
reaches 5 foot (!.5 m) elevations in places, also has
sparse, thin shell layers in the mantle similar to Gaulding
(authorsâ field notes).
The fluctuating sea level model also may explain the
problems with the site orientations described earlier.
There is no evidence that either Taylor or Hillebrandt
bayous actively meander to any significant degree, even
though their courses wind through the basin. It may be
that the streams originally were in a different alignment
at the time of pre-Wulfert sea level events, alignments
to which the original formation and footprint of the older
shell-bearing sites conformed. The basin then was
flooded during the Wulfert event; the prior stream channels were no longer in use and may even have filled

83

with sediment. When the basin subsequently was dewatered, the two bayous may then have established
new alignments similar to those of today.
Subsequent to the LaCosta high sea level event, the
basin was essentially a freshwater environment with
shellfish only rarely encountered. It may be that there is
an unrecognized population of non-shell sites in the
basin especially from this final period of prehistory.
However, it will require different surveying techniques
to test this possibility.

It should be feasible to test the Tanner sea level model
to determine its applicability to the upper Texas and southwest Louisiana coast. For example, the small beach ridge
complex on the northwest shore of Turtle Bay/Lake
Anahuac could easily be investigated for age, elevation,
and perhaps even sedimentological characteristics. More
difficult, but nevertheless possible, would be obtaining
more radiocarbon samples fiâom the initia! levels of early
archeological sites on each of the Trinity River channel
stages to refine estimates of the latterâs termination dates.
Field studies possibly could be carried out to re-evaluate
the evidence for the termination of Trinity River channel
stage 3.
Also, there are two broad lines of investigation that
could be carried out in the Taylor Bayou drainage basin.
First is a program of mapping and stratigraphic testing at
several key shell sites in the basin. This would expand information about site orientations, record the basal and surface
elevations of archeological sites and any interbedded or
capping geological deposits, identify sub-site landforms,
and provide samples for radiocarbon dating. The other line
of investigation would be to extend archeological site surveying in two directions: 1) following the marsh-uplands
contact, or approximately the 5-foot (1.5 m) contour, looking
for additional shell sites; and 2) a pilot project of shovel
testing to search for non-shell habitation sites. If the results
from these projects were consistent with the Tanner sea
level model this would provide further confirmation of a useful environmental model that may explain geomorphology
and prehistoric settlement at a time scale similar to that of
the archeological components. If the results were not consistent, then the field investigations would still be important
because a new environmental model for the basin would be
needed to explain all the unusual site characteristics described earlier.

CHAPTER 6

SUMMARY AND LATE HOLOCENE CULTURE HISTORY

It is no exaggeration to say that the 1965 Texas Archeological Society field school at the Gaulding site has, in the
reflected light of other work carried out over the past 35
years, given new insights into the archeology of the northern Gulf coast. Indeed, with practically no points of comparison available in 1965, it might even be said that much about
the Gaulding site could not have been understood until recent years. After briefly reviewing the current status of archeological understanding in the Sabine Lake area at the
beginning of this report, it seemed that formation of the site
in a larger sense should be examined in addition to analyzing
the basic stratigraphy, artifacts, and faunal remains. When
did this site form; through what activities; and how did these
activities relate to the evolving environment of the Taylor
Bayou drainage basin?
At this time we can only stress that applying the Tanner
Late Holocene sea level model as a framework for prehistoric
settlement of the southeast Texas coast is just a preliminary
concept. But, working through several lines of circumstantial evidence that are available, it seems to be a viable working hypothesis. The hypothesis is interesting because of its
apparent consistency in explaining much of the physical
evidence seen at the Gaulding site, and at linking both the
culture history and the landscape history of the Taylor Bayou
drainage basin. Fortunately, there are opportunities available for further testing the modelâs implications. Given these
encouraging signs, much of the following summary is organized around the information in Figure 30.

and animals. During the warm, dry, Middle Holocene
Altithermal event Taylor Bayou would have been an especially attractive environment at least for intermittent habitation. But any archeology from that time or earlier will be
difficult to locate. It either is submerged, now that the entrenched stream valley is filled to overflowing, or is buried
under the extensive marsh deposits that blanket most of the
basin.
At circa 4000 years ago, however, the bayou was still
entrenched in its narrow stream valley. Sea level controlled
the level of water in the bayou, and was trending ever higher.
But pulses of sea level, rising and falling over periods of
hundreds of years, finally had reached high enough elevations (Tanner "A") to enable larvae of the brackish-water
clam Rangia cuneata to be flushed upstream into the middle
reaches of the basin and there to establish populations.
Rangia cuneata is a shellfish that is physiologically adapted
to live in fresh or salt water, although it can only reproduce
in low salinity habitats. At this time, Indian peoples began
harvesting and processing the clams at new settlement locations on the rugged, gullied, upland edge overlooking the
entrenched stream valley. Judging from the land snail assemblages found at Gaulding, the initial climate at this time
was still experiencing cold winters and warm, dry summers,
but was ameliorating from the extreme temperatures and dryness of the Altithermal. By circa 3700 calibrated years ago,
the area was noticeably more moist and warm with expanding riparian woodlands along the bayou and its tributaries.
During the time of this early shell-accumulating occupation at Gaulding, the peoples living there must have used
tools and other equipment that were largely made from perishable materials; very little technology from that time was
preserved in the site. The presence of oysters that probably
were collected many kilometers downstream suggests that
watercraft were in use at this early date. Nothing is known of
the plant foods they may have gathered and used but in
addition to the clams, they killed or scavenged relatively few

SUMMARY OF THE CULTURE HISTORY
The earliest visible archeology in the Taylor Bayou basin is the initial shell deposit at the Gaulding site, dating to
nearly 4000 calibrated years ago, at the onset of the Late
Holocene and Late Archaic. There is every reason to believe
that prior to this time prehistoric peoples often visited the
basin; Taylor Bayou undoubtedly was a perennial stream
and must have had suitable habitat for many desirable plants

85

vertebrate animals. Assuming the evidence is not biased by
preservation problems, these included birds, small animals
such as turtles and a moderate amount of fish. The largest
animals taken were occasional deer. Fishing may have been
done with nets as the technology included some perforated
clam shells that mâe believed to be net weights. Little is known
of the manner in which the habitation site was organized
during the early occupation, but the several layers formed
during this time signify different origins. The earliest laycq"
penetrated by the excavation may have been a refuse dump
(midden), although it still has some unexplained peculiarities. The contents of the succeeding levels suggest they
formed as domestic activity areas.
Around 3700 calibrated years ago use of this campsite
halted. From this time onward only a very little sediment
accumulated at the top of the old shell deposit. In this sediment, soil-forming processes began and continued for about
seven centuries. During part of this time interval, a lower
than normal sea level period occmTed (Tanner"B") that must
have ensured that the hydrology of Taylor Bayou was exclusively fresh water. No brackish water clam populations
could become established and no archeotogica! shell sites
formed. People may have continued using the basin though,
exploiting the nearby prairies and the freshwater riparian
environments, but leaving archeological residues that are
extremely difficult to detect.
Circa 2900 calibrated years ago, another high sea level
pulse (Tanner "C") may have occurred, raising the level of
Taylor Bayou again for three or four hundred years. As before, this must have enabled larvae of the brackish-water
clam, Rangia cuneam, to be flushed upstream establishing
new populations because Indian peoples again began to
harvest them. Ultimately they formed a substantial new accumulation of clam shells precisely on top of the old
campsiteâs shell debris that had been abandoned three-quarters of a millennium before. Even though sea level was higher
than normal at this time, there are no indications that water
overtopped the upper edges of the entrenched stream valley, at least not in the middle basin, as there is no sediment
accumulation mixed into the campsite shell debris at
Gaulding.
The climate at this time was largely a continuation of
the relatively warm and moist conditions that were beginning to set in near the end of the earlier shell siteâs use. This
second use of the campsite continued intermittently over a
span of perhaps two centuries or so. By the end of that time,
the climate was changing to somewhat drier conditions with
grasslands again expanding on the upland prairies sunâounding Taylor Bayou.
During the time of this middle period of occupation at
Gaulding, the people living there seemed to have changed
their tools very little from those used nearly a thousand
years before. Oysters continued to be collected from downstream near the lake, probably indicating continued watercraft use. Bone tools and chipped stone tools continued to

be extremely rare, and the mix of vertebrate animals they
obtained was not greatly different from that preserved from
the previous campsite dating hundreds of years earlier. Again,
little can be said about the organization of their campsites
since there is only a single data location fi:om each of the
stratigraphic layers accumulated at that time. However, what
is seen seems to be all debris formed in domestic activity
areas.
Around 2700 calibrated years ago, shell harvesting and
accumulation at this second campsite halted once again.
This may or may not have been related to the onset of the
next falling sea level period (Sanibel I), but the latter almost
certainly eliminated any possibility of periodically replenishing the Rangia clam beds. Although use of the basin may
have continued, it did not involve shellfish harvesting and
there is no known archeological evidence until several centuries later. Sometime during the period of 2000 to 2500 calibrated years ago, an apparently brief use of the surface of
the Gaulding site shell ridge occurred by people who left a
few sherds of Tchefuncte culture pottery. This was during
the previously mentioned low sea level period and although
there are some shells in the deposit it cannot be said whether
they were in association with the pottery. One advantage of
pottery-using cultures is that there is a lot more artifact debris that can leave a habitation signature. This small amount
of Tchefuncte pottery may be an indication of some nonshellfishing use of the Taylor Bayou basin. In addition, there
was another site of significant size with Tchefuncte culture
pottery located at a much higher elevation in the tar upper
reaches of the drainage basin. Although this site, too, contained small amounts of Rangia clam shell, it may have been
largely associated with using the basin during the low sea
level, fresh water period.
At around 2000 calibrated years ago, the highest sea
level pulse (Wulfert) began, lasting for about five centuries.
The water level evidently spilled out of the entrenched stream
valley and rose up at times to a level about 1.5 meters above
todayâs sea level. This event drowned the entire lower and
middle drainage basin. It relocated the shoreline landward
for substantial distances in some areas, displacing possible
locations for habitation sites to above the 5-foot (1.5 m)
contour line. Marsh deposits formed throughout the middle
and lower basin, and the entire ponded area began to be
filled with sediment blanketing drowned amheological sites
and geomorphic features. Although some shell-bearing archeological sites attributable to this period have been found
at the higher elevation (e.g., 41JF60), they have not been
investigated. Along with small quantities of Rangia shell,
indicating some occasional habitation, the upper deposits
at Gaulding include potsherds that could easily be attributed to the time period between the respective ages of
Tchefuncte sherds and Caddoan sherds found in the same
deposits.
The climate from this time onward was approximately
the moist precipitation and moderate seasonal temperatures

Chapter 6: Summary and Late Holocene Culture History

that characterize the present. However, the abundance of
clam beds declined sharply from this time on and archeological shell sites, while they are not unknown, also are not
numerous. This reduction, but not elimination, of clam populations during a time of higher sea level may have been a
combined function of shoaling of the bayou channel and
increased freshwater flow resulting from the moist climate.
This highest sea level event came to an end around
! 500 calibrated years ago with the onset of another !ow sea
level period (Buck Key) that, in turn, ended with the final,
more modest, high sea level period (LaCosta) from 500 to
1000 calibrated years ago. One consequence of the 1500 to
2000 years ago high sea level period may have been that it
lifted the bayous out of their long-time channel which then
may have become filled with sediment. When sea level again
fell (Sanibel II), the bayou channels apparently became established in slightly different locations, because the orientations of numerous sites no longer conform to the bayou
channels of the present. Although large Rangia cuneata
beds were no longer being established, small ones occurred
from time to time, possibly during the 500 to 1000 year ago
sea level rise.
There was a final use of the Gaulding shell ridge around
600 to 700 years ago. Smal! quantities of shellfish were harvested and processed here, although another contemporaneous site (the upper zone of 41JF11) located not far away
had a more substantial shell accumulation. The climate at
this time continued more or less like that of the present. The
technology preserved at the site from this time is somewhat
elaborated over that used by the Late Archaic peoples of
more than a thousand years earlier. By this time the toolkit,
though still limited, included some different projectile points
and other chipped stone tools, bone awls, shell ornaments,
and perforated clam shell net weights. The quantities of vertebrate animals had increased significantly and had begun
to proportionally displace shellfish (assuming that most of
the harvested shellfish were eaten). By the time of this final
use of the site, it was apparently being visited during the
spring months, and possibly during the winter as well. Deer,
alligator, and fish had become the major components of the
vertebrate animal diet. The presence of green sea turtle bones
in the site tells a clear story of canoeing downstream as far
as the Gulf beaches to collect oysters, shells from the
beaches, and, in that one case, a sea turtle. It still is not
possible to tell much about the organization of the campsite
at this time, but the contents of the sediment suggest that
the particular location that was bulk-sampled may have been
a midden and latrine area. During or after this time, a middleaged adult woman visiting this area died and was interred on
the Gaulding shell ridge.
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS FOR FUTURE
INVESTIGATIONS
It is fortunate in the Taylor Bayou drainage basin that
apparent evidence of the high and low sea level episodes is

87

preserved. Unlike the major floodplains of the Neches and
Sabine Rivers, there generally are not the large-scale hydrologic processes to flood, erode, or aggrade thereby hiding
or erasing much of the evidence of low amplitude sea level
fluctuations. There is a remarkable consistency between
certain dated landscape features in Taylor Bayou and nearby
northern Gulf locations, and the Tanner sea level model that
we are hard-pressed to explain in other ways. In order to
make this information come together, though, it was important to calibrate the dating to align the scales of environmental and cultura! models.
This study also points to some important additional
research needs in the Taylor Bayou area. Additional site
surveying and mapping are needed to test whether some of
the expected consequences of this model are in fact the
case. Fortunately, a number of bits of geological and archeological evidence that were collected for other purposes also
turned out to be relevant to the limited testing of the sea
level model that was done here. But testing the sea level
hypothesis can be expanded in the Taylor Bayou basin, and
in certain other areas of the northern Gulf coast as described
earlier.
Another lesson from Gaulding came in the benefits of
detailed analysis of bulk samples, cores, and thin sections.
By providing several lines of evidence bearing on the formation processes at the site, a more robust analysis was
achieved. The detailed analysis of archeological sediments
seems to indicate at least some formation activity signatures. If bulk samples were taken from several locations in a
single stratigraphic layer, it might be possible to begin a
two-dimensional reconstruction of the layout of camp activity organization. In addition, a reasonably convincing argument was developed that the three-part aggradational model
(matrix rich top and bottom layers with a complex, matrix-free
middle), rather than being entirely a result of cultural activities forming the site, seems instead to be natural processes
(top and bottom) imprinted on the cultural processes of archeological accumulation. That is to say, the cultural activities and regional geological processes were occurring simultaneously and intersected at the archeological site. This
conclusion, though, still needs more investigation because
whatever was going on during the formation of Layers 2 and
3 at Gaulding still is not clear. Also, verification is needed
that this conclusion is valid at certain sites in other areas,
such as the Trinity River delta, where the three-part pattern
likewise is seen.
Finally, and apart from the geoarcheological emphasis
of the previous discussion, continuing the sediment analysis of the ceramic pastes could lead to mapping distributions of more detailed cultural patterns of pottery manufacture. These may then be used, possibly, to identify such
things as the multiple layers of social boundaries that are
hypothesized by Moore (1995) and which might constitute
the basic social structure of the tribal groups whose residues are recognized as the Mossy Grove tradition.

1965 CONSOLIDATED FIELD DESCRIPTIONS OF
STRATIGRAPHIC "ZONES" (FIGURES 6, 8)
The standard for describing archeological sediment at
the time of the field school was much different than the
geoarcheological standards employed today. Each observably distinct stratum was given a descriptive label that reflected the principal distinguishing visual characteristics.
There were a multitude of minor differences in terminology
employed by the various recorders that may have been due
to intrasite variation in the deposits or to inconsistencies
among the descriptions. All of the profile descriptions were
reviewed and the terminology was consolidated as given
below.
Zone A; black loamy humus with generally large, whole
shell
Self explanatory.
Zone B; generally tan soil with large, whole shell
Loose generally whole shell with some matrix soil; lighter
in color than Zone A.
Zone C; finely crushed shell
Burned shell fragments are readily noted in shell samples
from this zone; it generally is thinner than other zones, often
shows lensing, and is intermittent.
Zone D; loose, clean, generally whole shell
Self explanatory.

Zone E; mixed whole and crushed shell
Burned shell is readily noted in this zone, and the clam
shells are markedly smaller than in higher zones.
Zone F; mixed heavy plastic clay and whole shell
Identical to Zone G except that Zone F contains some
shell and bones.

Zone G; sterile basal clay

STRATIGRAPHIC LAYERS IN PROFILE BI(WEST),
Section Coordinates: N250-255/W 106 (Figures 7, 8)
The descriptions given below were made in 1995 and
are based entirely on the observations made of the appearance of the layers in the exposed vertical profile. Most attributes are self explanatory, although the following clarifications are provided: percentages were visually estimated;
thickness of the chalky rind on the R. cuneata shells was
deternained by scratching with a knife blade and the scale is
relative to those examined in this profile; acid reaction was
determined with 5% HC1; pocket penetrometer readings were
only possible when there was a dense sediment matrix and
was performed on fresh damp surfaces; Munsell colors also
were determined on fresh surfaces.

BULK SAMPLE DATA FROM B-1 (WEST),
Section Coordinates N250-255/W106 (Figures 14, 15,

16)
Eleven bulk column samples were taken from the layers
exposed in the B- 1 (west) profile for analysis of their composition. The sample locations are shown on Figure 11; their
volumes were roughly 2000 cc and they were each processed
as follows:
1. The entire sample was air dried thoroughly;
2. Ten gm of matrix was removed from the sample and
diluted with 25 ml of distilled water for pH determinations using an Oakton pHTestr3 meter (three separate
readings were averaged for the result reported here);
3. The wet pH sample sediment was re-dried and returned
to the main sample;
4. The complete dry sample was weighed and then placed
in a 5 gallon bucket with 2-3 gallons of distilled water to
soak for at least 24 hours;
5. Floating debris and terrestrial gastropod shells were
removed with an aquarium net and the submerged sediment agitated until no more vegetal material or snail
shells floated to the surface;
6. The entire sample was then water-washed through 8
nested sieves retaining all but the silt/clay fraction;
7.

Each sieve fraction was air dried and weighed (Table
13);

The retained material in the two largest screens (-3.65
and -2 phi, or all material larger than 4 ram) was sorted
for identifiable constituents, which were nearly all R.
cuneata shells; the number of right and left umbos were
counted to determine the degree of pairing; shell lengths
were measured from whichever side had the largest number of measurable valves; and whole valves were examined under low power magnification for precipitated
calcium carbonate crusts (Table 14);
9. The I phi fraction (.5 to 1.0 mm) was point-counted as a
proxy for the composition of matrix (Table 15). For point
counting in soils and sediment work, 1500 grains is recommended as an adequate compromise between statistical assessment of variability and the time costs of conducting the counting (Brewer 1964:50). A study of archeological sediments on the northern Gulf of Mexico,
after comparing results of point-counting samples up
to 2000 grains, determined that little fluctuation in percentage estimates occurred above a sample size of 500
grains (Gagliano et al. 1982:99). Two of the Gaulding
samples were counted up to roughly 1500 grains and
the results were similar to those reported by Gagliano et
al. However, since it was intended during analysis of
results, to subdivide the point-counts into depositional
and post-depositional components, the target of 800900 grains was used.
10. The compositional elements were divided into those
relating to the cultural activities forming the site - for
example, burned shell - and into others related to postdepositional natural processes, such as iron concretions. Table 16 was prepared in which the two categories were divided and proportions separately calculated.

UNDISTURBED CORES AND THIN-SECTIONS
FROM B-1 (WEST)
Section Coordinates N250-255/W 106 (Figure 11)
Two .6 m long and 12.5-cm diameter PVC pipes were
beveled on one end and driven with a sledgehammer into
undisturbed shell deposit. The upper core was driven in
from the ground surface while the lower core was driven
from the pedestal left after an abortive attempt to secure a
plaster-jacketed undisturbed sample of the deposit. Once
profile sampling was completed, the cores were removed
and sealed on each end for transport. Numerous quarterinch (7.6 mm) holes then were drilled through the casing and
the sample was left to air dry for several months. Once dry,
the cores were impregnated with epoxy and cut in half lengthwise by Paul Goldberg (Boston University). One half of
each core was polished and used as a permanent stratigraphic
reference. The other half was used for preparation of eight
thin-sections. Although only a brief petrographic examination of the thin sections was possible in time to include with
this study, both the polished cores and the thin sections
were examined in detail with a binocular microscope at 10x
and 20x magnification to clarify descriptions from the out-

The bulk samples from the original excavation represented a variety of collecting methods, sizes, and composition. Consequently, they were not sieved but they were
examined for evidence about the shells: species, size, and
condition. Broadly the species may be divided into three

(Table 17); and 3) many Rangia cuneata which were measured for shell length. The Rangia data were not included
here because they were similar to the measurements derived
from the 1995 bulk samples, and because the uncertainty
about correlation of some of the layers between excavation
units.

The radiocarbon-based absolute age estimates used in
this study originated from a multitude of sources, procedures and sample materials. Most of the dates used were run
before 8~3C measurements were available to correct for isotope fractionation and before reservoir correction problems
were understood. A number of the dates being used are the
boundary ages an investigator has interpreted from a group
of radiocarbon dates. Aligning all of these "dates" through
calibration is the only means available to normalize these
diverse results, but it entails assumptions and procedures
that might not be obvious, so they are described in this

4.

appendix. The terminology used here, particularly measured
age, conventional age, and calibrated date is as defined by
Stuiver and Reimer (1993). The procedures that were used
for calibrating radiocarbon dates are as follows:
1.
Calibrate with the University of Washington Quaternary Research Centerâs CALIB computer program; as
2.

of January 1999, this software is in version 4.0.
For samples with a "conventional" age (i.e., corrected
for ~t3C)reported by the radiocarbon laboratory, use
that value rather than start with the laboratoryâs "measured" age and recalculate the g~3C normalization using
CALIB. The differences between CALIB and laboratory conventional dates, which may be based on different calibration software, seem to be slight and using the
lab-reported "conventional" ages is one way to mini-

5.

mize having slightly different numbers in circulation for
the same sample. For samples with no lab-reported conventional age or ~~C value, estimate the conventional
age using an average ~3C value fiâom the same kind of
sample material and preferably from the same general
area. If this is not available, use an approximation of
3.

~3C from Stuiver and Reimer (1998:Table 1).
For calibration of charcoal and Rangia cuneata, use
the CALIB 4.0 atmospheric dataset 1 (filename
INTCAL98.14C) which is a decadal atmospheric dataset.
It is not yet clear which dataset is most suitable for the
oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Older versions of CALIB
had both decadal and bidecadal datasets available, but
since archeological Rangia cuneata typically only lived
for 3-6 years, the decadal dataset was still a better approximation for short-lived samples than the bidecadal
dataset. For true marine shells, use data set 3 (filename
MARINE98.14C). While the appropriate dataset is clear
for most organic materials, there has been confusion
about which one to use with Rangia cuneam, a species
that survives in habitats ranging from freshwater to full
estuarine salinity. While it might seem that the marine
dataset should be used with such shell samples, the
CALIB 4.0 manual advises that lacustrine samples be
"... calibrated with the atmospheric dataset due to comparable rapid exchange rates" (Stuiver and Reimer
1998:5). In the sense that shallow waters with rapid mixing also are typical of northern Gulf estuaries, bayhead
river deltas, floodplain lakes and their tributary and dis-

6.

tributary streams, this suggests that it is better to use
the atmospheric dataset for calibration purposes involving Rangia cuneata as the sample material. This is done
also for the sha!!ow water oysters occasionally used for
dating. This dataset conclusion is reinforced by comparing 6~C measurements of marine species (Stuiver
and Reimer 1998:Table 1) to those ofRangia cuneata;
while they sometimes overlap, generally the two are
distinctly different.
Reservoir correction for dilution of ~4C is not necessary
in the Sabine Lake area (Aten 1983:Appendix A). However, a local correction is needed in the lower Trinity
River and possibly in the Brazos and other major streams
to the west, although this need has not yet been clearly
documented. Unfortunately, the 1983 study did not
clearly distinguish between the main streams draining
large interior basins, and the local tributaries. When the
-225 years reservoir correction for Rangia shells from
the Trinity deltaic plain is used, this should be subtracted from the measured age before computing the
conventional age and calibrating. Shells harvested from
tributaries with local drainage basins, such as Clear Lake
or Buffalo Bayou, around the Galveston Bay estuary
should not be corrected other than for 6~~C unless there
is a specific reason to do so.
Calibrate with CALIBâs Method A (curve intercepts)
rather than using the probability approach (Method B)
only because the former method of presentation is customarily used in the northern Gulf region.
Set other CALIB options to: a) laboratory error multipliers at 1; b) curve smoothing with 10 points (i.e., a 100year running average) to minimize noise and unnecessary intercepts; and c) round all calibration results to
the nearest decade.

CALIBRATION LOG
Taylor Bayou Drainage Basin
Description
Seven new dates were obtained in 1997 for samples
from B-1 (west) at the Gaulding site (41JF27). In addition,
there are three dates from other sites in the drainage basin
and a fourth from a Tchefuncte component at a site on
Conway Bayou immediately east of the Sabine River. These
were discussed in the report and the results were given in
Table 1.
Material
Rangia cuneata.

Calibration Procedure
For the 41JF27 samples, the conventional age provided
by the radiocarbon laboratory was calibrated with the
INTCAL98.14C dataset. Samples from 41JF 1 !, 41JF35, and
16CU108 were only available as measured ages. The average ~3C value fiâom the 41 JF 27 samples (-5.3 ppm) was used

ary dates for the ceramic periods were obtained from samples
of the mollusc Rangia cuneata to which a local reservoir
correction of -225 years had been applied to accommodate
an excess of "dead" carbon in the surface waters from the
interior Trinity River drainage basin.

Calibration Procedure
The calibrations were run on the ceramic period boundary dates from Aten (1983:Table 14.2). To simplify the calibration of the sequence of ceramic periods, the boundary
dates were treated as if they were measured dates on Rangia
cuneata. They were given an arbitrary standard deviation of
+80 years and retained the previously incorporated local
reservoir correction (-225 years). Based on many recent shell
dates from the lower Trinity River area, a ~~C value of -6
ppm was used to correct the measured dates to conventional dates. The latter then were calibrated using the
INTCAL98.14C dataset. For results, see Table 17.

Trinity River Channel/Delta Stages
Description
The main channe! and delta of the Trinity River has
relocated several times (Aten 1983:125-128). In the 1960s it
was important to interpret and to date this sequence because the initial ceramics associated with the archeological
sites that followed the abandonment of each channel stage
was expected to--and did--provide some of the first clues
to the structure of the ceramic technology changes and to a
culture-historical framework for the Galveston Bay area. Subsequently, the channel stage sequence was used as the environmental framework for human activities in the Trinity
floodplain.
Material
The channel stage chronology relies heavily on Rangia
cuneata radiocarbon samples in the same manner as the
Trinity River ceramic periods.

Turtle Bay Beach Ridge No. 2
Description
Immediately east of the Trinity River deltaic plain and
northwest of Lake Anahuac is a beach ridge complex of uncertain age. It has been mapped (Aten, field records) but
only limited information has been published (Aten 1983:187188, Figure 11.19, Table 14.1). Several of the ridges have
numerous archeological shell sites on them, although they
have scarcely been investigated. Ridge number 2 was penetrated with a shovel test and Rangia cuneata shells in baybottom deposits from under the ridge sediments were collected and dated. In addition, a small stratigraphic test excavated in one of the shell sites on top of the ridge yielded
ceramics in the early levels that date to middle or late Mayes
Island Period. The age of beach ridge number 2 is bracketed
on Figure 30 between the calibrated ages of the shell sample
under the ridge and the middle Mayes Island Period archeology on top of the ridge.

Material
Rangia cuneata.
Calibration Procedure
The dates were published as measured ages. They were
corrected to conventional ages using the average d~3C value
from 41JF27 (-5.3 ppm) and were calibrated using the
INTCAL98.14C dataset. No local reservoir correction was
applied. For results see Table 20.

Description
McBride et al. ( 1997:41 ) reviewed dates obtained some
4 decades ago by Gould and McFarlan (1959) and recommended new upper boundary age estimates for four prominent chenier trends, as listed below, based generally on the
youngest dates for each trend (also see Taylor et al. 1996).

Calibration Procedure
The underlying shell sample (TX- 1050, 41CH9/1) was
dated and calibrated in the same manner as described above
for the Trinity River archeological shell samples. The measured age less the -225 year local reservoir correction was
1417_+103, and the 2 standard deviation calibrated age is
1840 (1640) 1450 B.P. The age of the middle Mayes Island
Period is approximately 1690 cal ~3.P. thereby dating Beach
Ridge No. 2 to the interval from 1650 to 1700 cal raP.

Calibration Procedure
Because the original samples were dated so long ago,
the chenier trend upper boundary ages would have been
based on measured ages uncorrected for ~3C. Since no measured standard deviations were provided, this was estimated
at _+80 for al! four ages. The MARINE98.14C calibration
dataset was used and ~5~3C values were estimated at -5 ppm.

Tanner Late Holocene Sea Level Episodes
Description
The boundary dates calibrated here are from two
sources: the early three episodes are from Gunn (1997:Figure 5) and, while not so labeled in the source, are for convenience here called "Tanner A" (high), "Tanner B" (low), and
"Tanner C" (high). The boundary dates of the subsequent
episodes are taken from extensive mapping and radiocarbon
dating done in the Charlotte Harbor-Caloosahatchee River
area of southwest Florida (Stapor et al. 1991 )

dard deviation of_+ 150 years was estimated from the actual
sample data (Stapor et al., 1987:Appendix). The ~513C value of
+390 years and the local reservoir correction (R=5_+20) are
from Marquardt (1992:12). The calibration was run using the
MARINE98.14C dataset. For results see Table 22.

Appendix D: Correlation of Stratigraphic Analysis Units and Excavation Units

113

The primary definition of stratigraphic analysis units
(A.U.) was based on features of the B-1 (west) profile and
then those groups of strata were correlated throughout the
other excavations units in the site. The linkages are approximate and try to resolve sloping strata and non-equivalent
lithologic descriptions. Principally theA.U.s are needed for
analyzing the faunal remains, as nearly all ceramics are in the
uppermost 6-inch (!5-cm) level in all excavations, and because there are very few artifacts of any other kind. They
are important also to support the isopach map and crosssection (Figure 10). The following Table 23 lists the estimated correlation of excavation and sampling units from the
1965, 1974, and 1995-96 periods of investigation at the
Gaulding site.

AT THE GAULDING SITE, 41JF27
by Kenneth M. Brown

Appendix E: Terrestrial gastropods from the 1965 excavation

A small collection of 57 land snails was studied, using
Cheatum and Fullington (1971), Fullington and Pratt (! 974),
and Burch (1962) as the principal identification guides. No
comparative collection for the Gaulding site area was avai!able, although a small reference collection identified by
Raymond Neck from Berger Bluffin Goliad County was available for comparison.
The Gaulding site collection appears to be unsystematic and heavily size-biased, and presumably consists of
snails collected from the 1,.~ and V2 inch (6.3 to 12.6 mm) screen.
Measurements were made with vernier calipers after Cheatum
and Fullington (1971 :Figure 1 b); the notation N/M indicates
a measurement was not possible. No specimens smaller than
about 7 mm in diameter were recovered. Bulk sediment
samples sieved through very fine mesh and floated ought to
yield two or three dozen taxa of terrestrial and aquatic snails
from this area, in contrast to the five or six large species that
are represented here.
Recovery rates from similar habitats in nearby Chambers County show the kind of assemblage representation
that might be expected when wet screening through
medium-sized mesh is used. At least 14 taxa of land or freshwater snails were recovered from 41 CH 56 (Weinstein and
Whelan 1987:Table 4-13), where only about 2% of the snails
were recovered from the quarter-inch screen, the rest coming from eighth-inch or sixteenth-inch mesh (Weinstein and
Whelan 1987:Table 4-14). Perhaps a dozen or so snail taxa
were recovered from 41 CH 63 (Weinstein et al. 1989:Table
6-7), where the same mesh sizes were used.

A few of the snails examined from the first six-inch excavation level (lots 5, 16) have dark, unbleached shells and do
not appear to be very old.
It is surprising that no aquatic snails were recovered,
even given the unsystematic recovery methods. The Chambers County sites mentioned earlier also produced relatively
few aquatic taxa, despite the fact that water for wet screening was drawn from a shell-mining borrow pit and from Lake
Charlotte. No filtration system for the water pump is mentioned. In my experience, unless the pump intake is carefully
filtered, wet screen samples are often heavily contaminated
with modern aquatic biota that survive the journey through
the pump impeller intact. [The Chambers County wet-screening referred to was conducted with 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) mesh
screen over the end of the intake hose (R. A. Weinstein,
personal communication to L. Aten and C. Bolllich, 1999)].
Even so, few aquatic snails were recovered from those sites.

snails need at least some calcium for shell construction. Possibly many of the snails in this collection were attracted to
the Rangia shell midden as a ready source of calcium.
Polygyra texasiana, Oligyra orbiculata, and Rabdotus

There appear to be six taxa present in this small collection. Although neither Hubricht (1985 :Map 389) nor Cheatum
and Fullington (1971 :Figure 4) list Polygyra mooreana as
occurring in Jefferson County, both list it as present in
Galveston County. I have tentatively identified a few specimens as possibly Polygyra mooreana, based on smaller
size, the shape and placement of the peristomal teeth, and in
at least one case an umbilical furrow. If this identification is
wrong, then the specimens are probably small examples of
Polygyra texasiana, and there are instead five taxa present.
Cheatum and Fullington (1971:17) and Pilsbry (1940:623,624)
describe an interior tubercle on the cotumella of P. mooreana,
but I have seen no examples on these specimens. Hubricht
(1985:37) remarks that in the eastern part of its range, the
peristomal teeth of P. texasiana are spaced farther apart, as
in P. triodontoides (see Pilsbry 1940:Figure 393), and that is
certainly true of the Gaulding site specimens. Incidentally,
neither Hubricht nor Fullington and Pratt show any species

dealbatus are somewhat cosmopolitan snails and are fairly
widespread in the eastern and southern parts of Texas. All
three can range from prairie to woodland habitats. Oligyra
orbiculata is often seen in weedy or grassy disturbed (disclimax) habitats. Polygyra mooreana prefers wooded areas.
Mesodon thyroidus prefers deciduous floodplain woodlands
but can live in meadows or marshes; it is widespread in the
eastern United States. Stenotrema leai is perhaps the most
mesic-adapted of these taxa, "a snail of damp places near the
water" (Pilsbry 1940:678) in leaf litter or under logs, or in
meadows. It is widespread in eastern North America; La
Rocque (1970:Figure 420) shows it extending as far as New
England. These latter three taxa would be especially compatible with the heavy closed-canopy forest present along
Taylor Bayou.

AT THE GAULDING SITE, 41JF27
by Richard W. Fullington

Appendix F: Terrestrial gastropods from the 1995 bulk sampling

This appendix reports the identification and interpretation of the approximately 1,000 gastropod specimens recovered from 10 bulk samples. Aten and Bollich took these bulk
samples in 1995 from profile B-1 (west). The sampling and
the layer identification numbers are described in the main
body of this report. All of the bulk samples were approximately the same volume (roughly 2,000 to 2,500 cc). Prior to
their screening by Aten, each bulk sample was soaked for
several hours in distilled water. During this soaking process,
small gastropod shells floated to the surface and were
skimmed off with an aquarium net. The soaking samples
were repeatedly agitated until no additional gastropod shells
could be recovered and the resulting snail samples were
forwarded to me for analysis.
All of the specimens were terrestrial snail shells representing 6 taxonomic families. As assemblages, these taxa
represent three habitat preferences (Table 24).
~parian woodlands
Dense woodlands (usually mature trees) with moderate
to thick leaf litter floor adjacent to streams or rivers; the soil
generally is moist.

Hillslope woodlands
Heavy or sparse woods on sloping hillsides that usually are vertical extensions of riparian woodlands; however,
there is usually less leaf litter and the underlying soil is dry
during much of the year.
Mixed woodlands/open grassy areas
Open, grassy areas partially surrounded by trees and/
or brush; may be sloping or flat; inhabited by more xeric
tolerant molluscan species. Tabulation of species found in
each Layer sample and any accompanying comments are
given in Table 25.

DISCUSSION
Layers 10 (upper) and 10 (lower)
These uppermost layers contain the largest number of
species (8) although the number of individuals per species

123

is quite low when compared to the total number of individuals per species found in Layers 7, 8, and 9. The diversity of
species suggests a very suitable climate (mild temperatures
and increased annua! rainfall). Dense and moist woodlands
were adjacent to the site during this time period. The low
number of individuals suggests that the site was actively
occupied by humans and the snails were kept from coming
in to the organic debris (trash heaps).
Layers 6, 7, 8, and 9
The relatively small number of species found through
these layers suggests that the climate was more xeric than
the climate through the overlying layers. However, the climate apparently was not greatly different because the same
species are dominant in Layers 7 through 10 (upper). The
large number of individuals suggests that humans, particularly on any long-term basis did not actively occupy the site.
The snails had time to move into the site area. There is no
evidence that these specimens were flood deposited (there
would be a larger number of species and would most likely
include bivalves). Layer 6 has only four species present
while the numbers of individuals is similar to layers 7, 8, and
9.
Layers 4 and 5
The number of individuals significantly drops in Layers
4 and 5 although the number of species in Layer 5 is similar
to the number of species in Layer 10. The number of species
and individuals in Layer 4 is quite low. Layer 5 may have
experienced a climatic change from relatively dry summers
(xeric) and colder winter to a warmer and moister period.
Layers 2 and 3
The very low numbers of species and individuals found
through these layers suggests a severe drying trend that
ended in Layer 4. Increased acidification of the soil could
also be a contributing factor. Shells in these layers were
more decalcified (white, thin and chalky) than the shells found
in the overlying layers (except Layer 4). However, shell dissolution does not account for the paucity of species.
