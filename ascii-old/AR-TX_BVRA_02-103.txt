ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed water line project (18.75 miles) in central
Harrison County, Texas was conducted in May 2002 by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit 2855 with William E.
Moore the Principal Investigator. One previously unrecorded prehistoric site (41HS835)
was found on the first terrace above Quapaw Creek. The artifacts found during this
survey consist of numerous ceramics, a lesser number of lithic debitage, an unidentified
dart point base, and a probable Elam dart point in a homogeneous sandy mantle
overlying reddish clay. Ceramic analysis indicates that this is a late Caddo period site
dating sometime between A.D. 1400 and A.D. 1680 or possibly after A.D. 1680. BVRA
recommends that significance testing be conducted if avoidance and protection are not
possible. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission (THC),
Archeology Division; Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL); and BVRA.
The artifacts and records have been placed in permanent curation at TARL.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by the Blocker-Crossroads WSC to conduct a cultural
resources survey of 18.75 miles (68 acres) of proposed water line in central Harrison
County, Texas (Figure 1). The project, as currently planned, will place new water line
parallel to existing line and other buried utilities throughout a large section of the county
to the southeast of the city of Marshall (Figure 2). The line will consist of 4" and 6" pipe
and will be covered by 30" of earth, creating a maximum depth of disturbance of 36".
The trench width will be 15", and the distance from existing pipe and the new line will be
between 5 and 7 feet. In addition, two new wells will be created. Large trees within
paths of water lines will be avoided when possible, either by rerouting around or boring
under to prevent damage to the trees.
The project area is depicted on United States Geological Survey topographical
quadrangles Colliers Creek (1983) (Figure 3) and Stricklin Springs (1962; photorevised
1978) (Figure 4). Fieldwork was conducted on May 12-14, 2002 under Texas
Antiquities Permit 2855. William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator, and the field
crew consisted of James E. Warren (Project Archaeologist), Art Romine, and Bobby
Jemison.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Harrison County is located in the Northeast Texas section of the Eastern
Planning Region of Texas as outlined in a planning document prepared by the Texas
Historical Commission (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). In 1993, when the planning
document was published, Harrison County had .075 - .149 recorded sites per kilometer.
At that time there were 171 sites on file at TARL. Of this number, 84 were considered
not significant, the significance of 59 was unknown, 23 were viewed as probably
significant, and 5 were determined to be significant. At the time of this survey the
number of recorded sites has increased to 834. The interested reader is advised to
consult the planning document and other CRM reports discussed below for more
information regarding Caddoan sites in the area.
The project area is in a part of Texas that was inhabited by the early, late, and
historic Caddo Indians. Late Caddoan sites date from A.D. 1400 to A.D. 1680 when the
tribe entered the historical period (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:44). Distributions of
large numbers of Late Caddoan Period sites primarily cluster within the Red River,
Cypress Creek, and Neches River basins, while other smaller clusters are present in the
Angelina, Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine River basins, and the lower Cypress Bayou
in Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:126). Caddoan period sites with preserved
faunal and floral remains are not common in Northeast Texas, and those sites that do
contain excellent preservation are considered highly significant. Cemeteries and burial
mounds are common throughout Northeast Texas with the largest numbers of these
sites in counties north of the Sabine River which inlcudes Harrison County (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993:127). At the Taylor site (41HS3), for example, 71 burials were
reported. Caddoan sites of all time periods tend to occur exclusively in valley settings
such as floodplain floors, floodplain rises, valley terraces, upland projections, and
upland slope landforms (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:133).
A check of the records at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no archeological sites
have been recorded within the current project area. It was discovered that significant
sites have been recorded in Harrison County. Cultural Resources surveys and site
testing in the area have been conducted by Southern Methodist University (Gibson
1969), Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Perttula and Skiles 1987; Gadus et al. 1988; Fields
and Freeman 1997; Gadus et al. 1998; McWilliams and Fields 2001), and Southern
Archaeological Consultants (Keller 1996, 2000). Three major overviews of Caddo
archaeology have been authored by J. Peter Thurmond (1990) in his discussion of the
Cypress Creek basin, Dee Ann Story (1990), who presented a general review of the
Caddo area, and Timothy K. Perttula (19992) who authored The Caddo Nation and coauthored The Native History of the Caddo: Their Place in Southeastern Archeology and
Ethnohistory with James E. Bruseth (1998).

METHODS
Prior to entering the field a records check was made at TARL by Jean Hughes.
According to the TARL files, there are no previously recorded sites in the current project
area. It was noted, however, that numerous sites have been recorded in the region.
Surface visibility was poor throughout the project area, making shovel testing
necessary. The field crew drove the route of the proposed water line and stopped at
high probability areas where the subsurface was examined through shovel testing. High
probability areas are defined in this report as sandy hills in close proximity to creeks.
Each area was identified on the project area map with a field number, and notes were
kept as to why certain areas were shovel tested and others were not. In general, the
project area avoided major creeks except for two areas where it crossed Quapaw
Creek, a major drainage in Harrison County. The uplands above this creek appeared to
be high probability areas, and it was in this area that prehistoric site 41HS835 was
found.
Shovel tests were dug to clay when possible. The size of each test was 30 x 50
cm and varied in depth from 30 cm to 110 cm below the existing ground surface. All
excavated fill was screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. The results of the shovel
testing were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I), and the approximate location of
each test was plotted on a project area map prepared by J. F. Fontaine and Associates,
Inc. In all, 19 shovel tests were dug. Other areas where clay appeared to be near the
surface were examined by shovel probes and surface inspection. Shovel probes
consist of turning over the soil to confirm the presence of clay at or near the surface.
The matrix was not screened. Probes were dug throughout the project area including
the floodplains of Quapaw Creek. Areas shovel tested are presented in figures 3 and 4.
Three specialists examined the artifacts. Dee Ann Story conducted a preliminary
examination of the ceramics, while Timothy K. Perttula analyzed the ceramics and
produced Appendix II to this report. William A. Dickens commented on the lithics.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been
recorded in the project area. There was also no indication that any part of the project
area had been surveyed by professional archaeologists. Archaeological sites are
known to exist in the area, and some are considered significant.
One prehistoric site (41HS835) dating to the Late Caddo period was found on the
first terrace overlooking Quapaw Creek south of the small community of Crossroads
(Figure 5). The site was found through shovel testing. In the site area, nine tests were
excavated, and four contained cultural materials. Ceramics were the most common
artifact type with 57 specimens recovered from the four shovel tests. Ten specimens
were too small (less than 1 cm across) for analysis; therefore, only 47 specimens were
studied. The lithic assemblage consists of 10 flakes, 1 Elam dart point, and 1 dart point
base (probably a Gary). Figure 6 depicts the distribution of artifacts from the four shovel
tests. This site occupies a high terrace at the 290 foot contour overlooking the deeply
incised Quapaw Creek below (Figure 5). Since the survey crew was forced to remain
within the narrow project area right-of-way, the east-west boundaries of this site are not
known. The nine shovel tests, however, were adequate to delineate the north-south
boundaries at about 40 meters along this axis. The northern boundary was determined
by the presence of four negative tests to the north of the first positive test . The
southern boundary is fixed by the steep bank above the creek. Shovel tests 12 and 13
only produced a total of 3 sherds and 1 flake between 20 and 40 cm. These two tests
signal the beginning of the site, and the site area becomes more dense in terms of
numbers of artifacts at shovel tests 14 and 18 closer to the edge of the terrace. In these
two tests 52 ceramic sherds, 9 flakes, 1 dart point, and 1 dart point base were
recovered from depths ranging from 20 to 100 cm (Figure 6). Although artifacts were
found from 20 to 100 cm, the greatest number occurred at level 9 (80-90 cm). At this
depth, for example, 11 sherds, 1 dart point fragment, and 1 flake were retrieved from
shovel test 14, while 14 sherds were recovered from shovel test 18. The artifacts were
found within a homogenous reddish fine sandy loam overlying red clay. No soil color
changes were noted, and no burned rock or other evidence of features was observed.
Although no precise date can be assigned to 41HS835, the presence of brushed
ceramics are an indicator of a Late Caddo occupation. Overall, the ceramics at this site
are similar in that the majority of decorated sherds are brushed, and the predominant
temper is bone with some grog present in a few specimens. A review of ceramic types
in Handbook of Texas Archeology: Type Descriptions by Suhm and Jelks (1962)
revealed two types of Caddoan pottery found in the general area that contain brushing
as a decorative motif. These are Bullard Brushed, found principally in the areas of the
Neches and upper Sabine rivers (Suhm and Jelks 1962:21) and Karnack BrushedIncised, found in the vicinity of Caddo Lake in Harrison and Marion counties (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:85). Both of these types are late Caddoan types dating from A.D. 1200 to
A.D. 1500. Timothy K. Perttula authored an in-depth discussion of the ceramics from
41HS835 (Appendix II).

The flakes and dart points were made from local gravels and consist of chert, red
jasper, quartzite, and sugar quartz. Primary, secondary, and interior or tertiary flakes
are present. The dart point resembles the Elam type (illustrated in Appendix II) as
described by Turner and Hester (1985:92) and Suhm and Jelks (1962:185). The base
is ground, and it is made of sugar quartz or quartzite. Elam points are thought to be
Late or Transitional Archaic. The biface fragment is made of sugar quartz and probably
represents the base of a Gary point (not illustrated).
This site is considered by BVRA to have research potential and is probably
significant. Significance is based, in part, on the number of artifacts and the depth at
which the greatest concentration was found. That site 41HS835 may date to the Late
Caddo or Historic Period is also of interest as these sites typically produce useful
information and are not abundant. Based on the artifact distribution in figures 5 and 6, it
is obvious that there is a very dense occupational area next to the creek with
diminishing amounts of cultural materials to the north. It also appears that this is a deep
site as the majority of sherds were found between 80 and 90 cm below the existing
ground surface. The abundance of brushed sherds are an indicator of utility wares
being used, suggesting this was a campsite rather than a ceremonial center. Its
proximity to Historic Period Caddo trails is also an interesting aspect of this site.
Perhaps, testing would reveal trade goods that would add to the database for this period
of Caddo history.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Prehistoric site 41HS835 was found during this cultural resources survey. It is
recommended that it be tested for significance if avoidance is not possible. BVRA
suggests that the water line be placed in the ditch or slope below the site where
disturbance has already occurred. An alternative to testing is monitoring of the
construction of the water line. Caddo sites in this area are known to contain human
remains, and this is the major concern regarding this site. Any construction involving
the disturbance of the site area should be coordinated with the Archeology Division,
Texas Historical Commission. The remainder of the project area was disturbed due to
built up areas and ditches adjacent to the roads. Since no sites were found in these
areas, it is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed in these areas as
planned.
