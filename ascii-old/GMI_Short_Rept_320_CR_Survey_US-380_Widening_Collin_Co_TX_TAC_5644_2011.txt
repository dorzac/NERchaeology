MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 24 June 2010, Geo-Marine, Inc., under contract to HNTB Corporation, conducted a cultural
resources survey for the proposed road widening of US 380 between Custer Road and Bois d’Arc
Road in western McKinney in Collin County (CSJs 0135-02-045 and 0135-02-046). The
proposed survey segment is approximately 4 miles long with a current right-of-way width of 160
feet with most of the construction occurring within the top 3 feet. Placement of columns for the
widening of the bridge at Wilson Creek would be deeper, likely up to a depth of 10 feet or to
bedrock. A total area of 77.58 acres is the current area of potential effects (APE) for the project.
The survey occurred entirely within state property and did not require additional right-of-way or
easements. Project Archaeologist Ben Fullerton and Field Technician Lindsey Skelton, both of
Geo-Marine, Inc., performed the survey for this project. The archeological field investigation
involved an intensive archeological survey with shovel testing and reconnaissance. A total of 16
person-hours was expended on the fieldwork for this project. Three shovel tests were excavated
adjacent to Wilson Creek and three shovel tests were excavated in level areas below the road
crown and/or fill embankments. Each shovel test encountered disturbed deposits and none
yielded any archeological materials. The only items recovered during shovel testing were
consistent with modern, roadside trash. Overall, the archeological integrity of the APE is very
low. Geo-Marine, Inc., recommends that, in accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC
26.2, no further investigation is necessary. Consequently, it is recommended that construction be
allowed to proceed. All data generated from this project will be permanently housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion of this project.

INTRODUCTION
The Dallas District of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing to widen
the existing U.S. 380 roadway from four to six lanes 12 feet (ft) in width (three in each direction)
within the existing right-of-way (ROW) for the 4-mile stretch between Custer Road and Bois
d’Arc Road in western McKinney in Collin County (CSJs 0135-02-045 and 0135-02-046) (Figure
1). The proposed improvements between Custer Road and Bois d’Arc would consist of six 12-ft­
wide lanes that would be curbed and guttered, a 16-ft-wide raised median, and no outside
shoulders. Proposed improvements to the bridge traversing Wilson Creek include widening of
the bridge to accommodate six 12-ft-wide lanes and a 16-ft-wide raised median. The width of the
proposed bridge would be 112 ft compared to the existing 86-ft width. The proposed bridge at
Wilson Creek would incorporate approximately 6-ft-wide pedestrian sidewalks along both sides
of the bridge. The proposed sidewalks would be separated from the six main lanes by a 3-ft-wide
outside shoulder and traffic rail. Four 36-inch-diameter columns are proposed to support the
portions of the bridge that would be widened. The new 36-inch-diameter piers would be aligned
with the existing piers on each side of the creek. There would be a total of four piers added, two
on each side of the creek, not including the extensions to the abutments to provide for the
increased width. The only modifications in the creek would be stone protection riprap and minor
grading on the upper portion of the creek banks to protect the abutments. Available typical
existing and proposed sections and an aerial containing the layout of the project are presented in
Appendix A.
The proposed survey segment is 4 miles (mi) long with a current ROW width of 160 ft with all of
the construction occurring within the top 3 ft. Placement of columns for the widening of the
bridge at Wilson Creek would be deeper, likely up to a depth of 10 ft or to bedrock. A total area
of 77.58 acres is the current area of potential effects (APE) for the project. The survey occurred
entirely within state property and did not require additional ROW or easements.
TxDOT is required under the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12) to provide
environmental and cultural assessments of the area to be affected by the proposed construction
activities. HNTB Corporation (HNTB) was contracted to provide the environmental consulting
services for the project. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI; project # 30007.14.01), of Plano, Texas, was
then subcontracted by HNTB to provide the cultural resources investigation portion of the project.
An intensive survey including a reconnaissance was conducted on June 24, 2010, by Ben
Fullerton and Lindsey Skelton of GMI, for a total of 16 person hours. Melissa Green, also of
GMI, served as Principal Investigator.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this APE was to conduct an inventory or
determine the presence/absence of archeological resources (36 CFR 800.4) and to evaluate
identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CRF 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended, or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) under the Antiquities
Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12). This project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
5633.
The following sections of this report provide an abbreviated environmental setting and cultural
history, and summarize the methods, findings, and recommendations based on the results of the
survey.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
This project corridor falls in a formally rural to rapidly urbanized upland setting in Blackland
Prairie. The underlying geology over the majority of the project area consists of the Upper
Cretaceous Austin Group with Holocene Alluvium along Wilson Creek (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1991). Soils in the project area fall within the Houston Black-Austin association which
is composed of gently sloping to sloping, clayey soils that are deep over compact clays on
uplands (Hanson and Wheeler 1969). These soils are ideal for ideal for cultivation and pasture.
The association at Wilson Creek is the Trinity-Frio, which consists of deep, nearly level, clayey
and loamy soils on floodplains and are subjected to frequent flooding. The specific soils are
Altoga silty clay, 5 to 8 percent slopes, eroded; Austin silty clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes; Burleson
clay, 2 to 4 percent slopes, eroded; Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Lewisville silty
clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes, eroded; Stephen-Eddy complex; 3 to 5 percent slopes, eroded; and
Trinity clay, occasionally flooded (Hanson and Wheeler 1969).
Though US 380 (originally SH 24) has been a major east–west thoroughfare through Collin
County since at least 1936 (General Highway Map of Collin County), it has only been in the last
10–15 years that the project area has developed from primarily rural farmland to a more urban
setting with the establishment of combination residential/commercial/religious subdivisions near
and adjacent to US 380. Review of additional early soils, highway, and topographic maps further
proves this. This change from a rural setting to a more urban one has brought about several
previous impacts to the ROW and areas adjacent to it. These include the emplacement of buried
and aerial utilities, recent and current urban development, cut-and-fill for driveways, ditches, and
other features, and numerous generations of improvements and maintenance of the US 380 ROW
over time. Based on this information, surface visibility is expected to vary greatly depending on
the area, roughly from 100 percent visibility where vegetation has been stripped away or where
plowed fields abut the corridor, to 0 percent where manicured lawns or native grasses grow. The
potential for identifying prehistoric sites along the upland is poor, buried prehistoric sites within
the alluvium is good, and the potential for historic sites is fair.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Prikryl (1987, 1990) established a generalized prehistoric chronological framework of six periods
for the upper Trinity River basin. Investigations at Lewisville Lake in Denton County (Lebo and
Brown 1990) and Joe Pool Lake in Dallas County (Peter and McGregor 1988) refined this
framework to a four-period model. The overall regional applicability of the phases recognized at
both lakes, however, remains to be demonstrated. The generalized chronology presented here
(Table 1) reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted from both sets of investigations
but is based primarily on the model provided by Peter and McGregor (1988). Lebo and Brown
(1990; Brown and Lebo 1991) present a chronology keyed specifically for Lewisville Lake, but it
closely follows the chronology proposed for Joe Pool. Detailed synopses of the chronology of the
area can be found elsewhere and will therefore not be discussed in this report.

Prior Investigations
Prior to beginning fieldwork, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was consulted to determine if
any previously recorded cultural properties or cultural resources management (CRM) projects
have occurred within a 1-kilometer (km; 0.6 mile [mi]) radius of the project area. No
archeological sites were found within the search radius; however, there were several CRM
surveys within a kilometer as well as within the corridor itself (see Figure 1). In 1987, the State
Department of Highways and Public Transportation (now TxDOT) conducted a survey along US
380 from SH 289 to SH 78, which included this section of highway; though four sites were
recorded along that 25-mi stretch, none were along the present segment (Weir 1987). GMI under
contract with TxDOT conducted reconnaissance surveys along Custer Road (FM 2478) starting at
its intersection with US 380 and running southward in 2004 (Green 2004) and 2009 (Tiné 2009);
no archeological sites were identified. One small 10-acre survey for a wastewater plant for the
city of Celina was conducted just south of the project corridor in 2004 by AR Consultants, Inc.;
no sites were identified (Todd 2004). Four small surveys were conducted by the NCRS between
2004 and 2006 on small ponds/lakes on tributaries of Wilson Creek north of the project corridor.
According to the Atlas, no sites were identified, and no other information was available regarding
these projects. Based on the information available, the potential for identifying prehistoric sites
along the upland is poor, buried prehistoric sites within the alluvium is good, and the potential for
historic sites is fair.
In addition to the CRM projects in the area and according to the Texas Historic Sites Atlas, one
historic cemetery, the Buckner Cemetery is located within the 1-km radius. It is located
approximately 350 meters (m; 1,148 ft) from the eastern terminus of the project (Bois d’Arc
Road) and about 245 m (804 ft) north of US 380. The cemetery, currently located within the
grounds of the Third Monday Trade Day park parking lot, is all that remains of the town of
Buckner, which was the original county seat for Collin County. The cemetery contains a historic
marker stating the oldest documented grave is that of Franklin O’Brien (1850–1870). Since this
cemetery is located in an enclosed area and some distance away for project area, the likelihood of
burials within the current project ROW is extremely low to none.
Settlement for the town of Buckner began in the 1840s with the arrival of John McGarrah and his
claim to 640 acres. McGarrah opened a trading post and provided 50 of his acres for a townsite.
Collin County was established in April 1846 by the legislature, which also appointed a
commission to offer two locations within 3 miles of the center of the county to be considered for
establishment of the county seat. Through an election in July 1846, Buckner was chosen as the
county seat and a post office was secured. However, in 1848, a new election was called for by
4

the legislature because there had not been two locations within 3 miles of the center of the county
originally offered to voters for the location of the county seat. At that time, McKinney, which
was 3 miles southeast of Buckner was chosen. Mail was soon discontinued at Buckner, and by
1850, it was deserted (Texas Handbook Online 2010).

METHODS
The field methods consisted of an intensive archeological survey with shovel testing and
reconnaissance. Shovel tests were excavated adjacent to Wilson Creek where Holocene alluvium
is mapped and in several level areas throughout the project area below the road crown and/or fill
embankment that appeared to retain intact deposits. Each shovel test was approximately 35
centimeters (cm; 14 inches [in]) in diameter and excavated in approximately 20–cm (8–in)
arbitrary levels to 80 cm (32 in) below surface (bs), or until subsoil was encountered. The soils
removed from shovel tests were processed through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) mesh screen. The soils
and any artifacts observed in each shovel test were recorded on standardized forms. Walkover of
areas adjacent to Wilson Creek and other tributaries was also conducted to provide a better
examination of the cutbanks and also to determine the necessity for backhoe trenching. Digital
photographs were used to document the survey conditions, disturbances, and any cultural features
observed. Details of each photograph were recorded on standardized forms. Additionally, aerial
imagery over the last 15 years was consulted to observe the rate and degree of recent
development within the project area.
All data generated from this project will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeology
Research Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion of the project.

RESULTS
The entire project area is located in a gently rolling, upland setting that is rapidly transitioning
from a rural landscape to one that is suburban residential and commercial. The majority of
development within the project area has occurred over the last 10 years in response to the rapid
growth rate of McKinney and adjacent communities. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the
city of McKinney was the fastest growing city in the U.S from 2000 to 2008, with an increase of
66,482 persons and a growth rate of approximately 122.9 percent.
The cultural resources survey was initiated at the intersection US 380 (West University Drive)
and Custer Road and continued along US 380 for approximately 4 miles east to its terminus at the
intersection of US 380 and Bois d’Arc Road. The roadway was inspected to identify disturbances
and potential for intact archeological deposits or resources. The results of this process indicated
that the vast majority of the project area has been significantly affected by modern construction
activities. As a result, minimal subsurface investigations were employed. Shovel testing was
performed adjacent to Wilson Creek and in several areas throughout the project area that
appeared to be undisturbed (Table 2); however, each of these areas consisted primarily of
disturbed deposits and did not warrant further subsurface investigations. The project area
discussion below is divided into four arbitrary sections in order to facilitate descriptions of the
project area and results of the survey (Figures 2a–2d). The geographic locations of each digital
photograph cited in this report are depicted on the appropriate aerial figure associated with each
arbitrary section.

The 0.65-mi section of roadway between Custer Road and North Stonebridge Drive is
characterized primarily by the presence of artificial landforms built in association with the
construction and maintenance of US 380 and adjacent residential and commercial developments.
The north and south sides of US 380 within this section consist of relatively steep embankments
extending from the edge of the existing ROW toward the roadway. The base of the embankment
slopes on the north and south sides of US 380 to meet abruptly with the road crown and the two
features are separated by a drainage ditch (Figures 3 and 4). Fill is clearly visible on the
embankment and the road crown (Figure 5) leaving no level, undisturbed areas between the two
features. A buried fiber optics line is present on the midslope of the embankment on the south
side of US 380 (see Figure 4). The small tributary immediately west of North Stonebridge Drive
(see Figure 2a) has been channelized with concrete culverts and no cutbank exposures were
present. No further work was necessary here.

Figure 3. View west, showing the fill embankment, drainage ditch, and road crown on the north side of US 380.

Aerial imagery shows that this section has undergone very little commercial development since
1996, although a gas station at the southeast corner of Custer Road and US 380 was constructed
sometime between 2008 and 2009. Commercial development is also present at the northeast
corner of Custer Road and US 380. Deposits within the existing ROW have been significantly
affected by these construction projects, and ongoing construction activities observed during this
current survey (Figure 6) have likely destroyed any remaining intact deposits within the existing
ROW immediately east of the intersection of Custer Road and US 380.

SECTION 2: N. STONEBRIDGE DRIVE TO FOREST RIDGE LANE (FIGURE 2B)
The 1.17-mi section of roadway between North Stonebridge Drive and Forest Ridge Lane is also
significantly disturbed by the presence of fill embankments on the south side of US 380 (Figures
7 and 8) and a road crown and embankment occupying nearly the entire existing ROW on the
north side of US 380 (Figure 9). However, a small section of relatively level ground was present
on the north side of US 380 (see Figure 9). A single shovel test (Shovel Test 4; see Table 2) was
excavated in this area in order to test for the presence of archeological materials and to also
determine the degree of disturbance within the area. The shovel test yielded a very compact
sandy loam mixed with gravels and asphalt in the upper 40 cm bs. The deposits between 40 and
80 cm bs appeared to be relatively intact, although a small number of fill gravels (approximately
10 percent by volume) was encountered.
Several small streams were also noted crossing US 380 within this stretch of roadway; however,
very little flow is associated with the tributaries and each has been channelized with concrete
culverts (Figure 10). The natural courses of these streams have been significantly altered by
modern construction activities, eliminating the potential for the presence of intact archeological
materials.
Aerial imagery shows that this area has undergone significant residential development between
2004 and 2006. The existing ROW adjacent to the residential developments has been landscaped
in several areas and sidewalks have been installed below the embankments (Figure 11). A buried
water main is present on the north side of US 380, and fill deposits are visible on the surface
(Figure 12). The water main runs along the north side of US 380 throughout the project area,
further attesting to the high degree of previous construction impacts.

SECTION 3: FOREST RIDGE LANE TO FM 1461 (FIGURE 2C)
The 1.3-mi section of roadway between Forest Ridge Lane and FM 1461 lies primarily within the
floodplain of Wilson Creek (see Figure 2c), although a small portion of commercial development
is present east of Forest Ridge Lane and south of US 380. Although the landscape surrounding
US 380 is undeveloped, nearly the entire surveyed area within the existing ROW has been
significantly disturbed by the construction and maintenance of US 380. The north side of US 380
within this stretch is similar to the majority of the project area in that no level, undisturbed areas
are present between the fill embankment and road crown (Figure 13). On the other hand, the
south side of US 380 was much more level and suitable for shovel testing; however, the single
shovel test (Shovel Test 5; see Table 2) excavated within this area yielded a mixture of shale
fragments, asphalt, concrete, glass, metal, and rubber tire fragments in the upper 10 cm bs (Figure
14) and numerous road gravels between 10 and 25 cm bs. The subsoil was then abruptly
encountered below 25 cm bs, indicating that no undisturbed deposits that could contain intact
archeological materials are likely to be encountered within the existing ROW south of US 380.
No further investigations were necessary here.

Figure 13. View west, showing the fill embankment, drainage ditch, and road crown occupying the entire ROW on
the north side of US 380.

The areas adjacent to Wilson Creek where Holocene alluvium is mapped were closely inspected
for the presence of intact deposits suitable for shovel testing; however, the areas immediately
adjacent to Wilson Creek were found to retain very little contextual integrity due to previous
construction activities. In each quadrant surrounding Wilson Creek, concrete aprons have been
installed that descend approximately 3 m from the level of the roadway down into the stream
banks (Figure 15). The only areas adjacent to Wilson Creek that were conducive to shovel testing

were at road level above the concrete aprons. Shovel tests were excavated in the southeast,
southwest, and northeast quadrants (Shovel Tests 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and each yielded
similar profiles of compact fill with gravels, concrete, and asphalt found throughout each of the
units. Modern bottle glass was encountered in the upper 20 cm of Shovel Test 2, but no
archeological materials were recovered from any of the three shovel tests.
Subsequent to shovel testing, a stream cutbank exposure was observed just outside of the existing
ROW on private property (Figure 16). This approximately 4-m-high exposure was inspected for
the presence of buried soils or any archeological materials eroding out of the cutbank; however,
no buried soils or materials were found during this process. This finding in combination with the
fact that any intact Holocene alluvium adjacent to Wilson Creek within the existing ROW has
been sufficiently covered with a thick layer of fill and capped with concrete aprons precluded the
implementation of backhoe trenching at Wilson Creek. In short, the proposed widening of the
bridge at Wilson Creek would not affect any deposits that have not already been compromised.

Figure 16. View west, showing the approximately 4-m-high homogenous west cutbank of Wilson Creek exposed on
private property outside of the existing ROW.

The other tributaries that cross US 380 within this stretch of roadway (see Figure 2c) are very
small and ephemeral and have also been channelized with concrete culverts. No cutbank
exposures or high probability landforms were associated with these tributaries. As a result, no
further work was necessary at these locations.

19

During the current survey, ongoing construction activities were also observed in two separate
areas within this 1.3-mi section of the project area. The easternmost area currently being affected
is associated with the construction of Baylor Medical Center on the north side of US 380 (Figure
17) and unknown commercial development north and south of US 380 at the westernmost portion
of this section (Figure 18).

Figure 17. View east, showing ongoing construction activities for Baylor Medical Center on the north side of US 380.

SECTION 4: FM 1461 TO BOIS D’ARC ROAD (FIGURE 2D)
The 0.87-mi stretch of roadway between FM 1461 and Bois d’Arc Road retains the least
contextual integrity of any section within the project area. Disturbances within the existing ROW
associated with modern commercial development characterize this stretch of roadway. According
to recent aerials, the majority of these businesses were constructed prior to 1995. Directly east of
FM 1461 and south of US 380, landscaped areas, sidewalks, and utilities take up nearly the entire
existing ROW (Figure 19) leaving no undisturbed areas suitable for shovel testing. Directly west
of Bois d’Arc Road and south of US 380, commercial development has also affected the existing
ROW, but some level areas with potentially intact deposits were observed. Shovel Test 6 was
excavated in one of these areas, but fill was encountered throughout the unit. As a result, no
further subsurface testing was employed here.

Figure 19. View west, showing sidewalk, buried utilities, and sprinkler system in front of commercial developments
on the south side of US 380.

21

The north side of US 380 west of Bois d’Arc Road is composed of a water line and buried
utilities (Figure 20) and could not be tested. Further west of this, disturbances associated with the
Third Monday Trade Day development (see Figure 2d) were noted. The existing ROW within
this area consists of a steep road crown and numerous concrete driveways with buried utilities on
the northern periphery of the ROW (Figure 21). The grassy median south of this (Figure 22) has
also been significantly affected by construction activities. Finally, a small ephemeral tributary
(Franklin Branch) was inspected near the Third Monday Trade Day. The tributary appears to
maintain low flow and is flanked in each direction by asphalt and drainage ditches (Figure 23).
Another small tributary is present to the west of Franklin Branch; however, the stream has also
been channelized within the existing ROW. These areas retain very little integrity; no further
investigations were necessary.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The results of the intensive archeological survey with shovel testing and reconnaissance
conducted along the 4-mi stretch of US 380 between Custer Road and Bois d’Arc Road (CSJs
0135-02-045 and 0135-02-046) did not encounter any cultural materials and indicated that the
majority of the project area has been significantly disturbed by modern construction activities
associated with rapid suburban growth. No historic properties as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, 13
TAC 26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8 were identified during the archeological
investigation of the current project APE. The upland setting and the scarcity of a major water
supply indicate that prehistoric archeological remains within the project area are not probable.
The only major water supply within the project area is Wilson Creek, and although Holocene

alluvium is mapped adjacent to the creek, previous impacts have significantly affected any intact
deposits within the existing ROW adjacent to the creek. Historic remains (e.g., remains from
early farmsteads or tenant houses), however, are more likely to be encountered along the corridor.
Nevertheless, if present, these remains would have been severely altered by existing impacts from
road construction, buried utility placements, and new residential and commercial construction and
construction preparation. The existence of numerous buried and aerial utilities within and
adjacent to the existing ROW in the soils along the corridor certainly have disturbed, if not
destroyed, any existing archeological remains.
Therefore, based on the results of this cultural resources survey, there is low to no potential for
deposits containing archeological materials within the current or proposed ROW. I n accordance
with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2, no further investigation is necessary. Consequently,
it is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed. However, in the unlikely event that
evidence of archeological deposits is encountered during construction, work in the immediate
area shall immediately cease. TxDOT archeological staff shall be contacted in order to initiate
accidental discovery procedures under the provisions of the Programmatic Agreement among
TxDOT, Texas Historical Commission (THC), Federal Highway Administration, and Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation; and the Memorandum of Understanding between TxDOT and
THC.
