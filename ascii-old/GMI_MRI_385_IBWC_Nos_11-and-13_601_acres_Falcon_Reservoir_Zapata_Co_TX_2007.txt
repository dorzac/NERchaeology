MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of cultural resources survey at Falcon Reservoir in Zapata County,
Texas. The project consisted of intensive archaeological survey of 601 acres and the preliminary
reconnaissance assessment of features at previously reported sites in sections of Falcon Reservoir
designated the âCentral Unsurveyed Areaâ (CUA) and âNorthern Unsurveyed Areaâ (NUA). An
archaeological team from Camp Dresser and McKee and Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), conducted the
investigations under contract to the United States Section of the International Boundary and
Water Commission (USIBWC), Contract IBM04D0001, Task Order IBM05T0019, issued on
July 13, 2005.
As of this report, 871 archaeological sites are documented on Falcon Reservoir properties that fall
under the jurisdiction of the USIBWC. Some parcels in the NUA and CUA regions, however,
have still not been systematically surveyed, and the present project is part of efforts by the
USIBWC to satisfy archaeological site inventory and eligibility determinations under Section 110
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The work reported here was performed under
USIBWC Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) Permit Nos. 0011 and 0013 during
three field sessions in 2005 and 2006, respectively.
The goal of the survey was to systematically locate and, to the extent possible, identify the limits
of, archaeological sites to reduce further the acreage of the remaining unsurveyed areas. The
areas selected for survey in the NUA were situated along Arroyo Burro and the Rio Grande about
15 km (9 mi) north of the town of Zapata, and in the CUA along Arroyo CabaseÃ±a and Arroyo
Loma Blanca about 21 km (13 mi) south of Zapata. The goal of the feature assessment and data
recovery operation was to extract the maximum amount of information from the features
concerning age, structure, and function before they are adversely affected by natural or cultural
factors.
As a result of the survey, 39 sites were either newly recorded or revisited and updated. In the
NUA, this consisted of 25 archaeological sites. Seven of these sites were previously recorded
(41ZP1, 41ZP807â41ZP809, 41ZP811, 41ZP815, and 41ZP816), and 17 were newly recorded
(41ZP927â41ZP944) during the present survey. In the CUA, 14 sites were either newly recorded
or their records updated. Of these, 12 had been previously recorded (41ZP691â41ZP693,
41ZP697, 41ZP704, 41ZP707, 41ZP720, 41ZP743, 41ZP745, 41ZP765, 41ZP766, and 41ZP785)
xi

and two were newly documented (41ZP925 and 41ZP926). During the rerecording of sites in the
CUA, substantial collected data indicated that many previously recorded small adjacent sites were
actually parts of single, larger sites. As a result, 21 previously recorded sites in the area were
encompassed within five sites (41ZP692, 41ZP697, 41ZP707, 41ZP743, and 41ZP765).
Additionally, 11 previously recorded sites in the CUA (41ZP186, 41ZP713, 41ZP714, 41ZP718,
41ZP719, 41ZP742, 41ZP746, 41ZP747, 41ZP749, 41ZP763, and 41ZP777) could not be
located.
Eligibility recommendations were based on the potential of sites to possess integrity of surface
and subsurface cultural deposits, contribute toward an understanding of the chronology of use,
and contribute general knowledge toward our understanding of the occupation and use of the
South Texas region. Twenty-two sites newly recorded or redocumented during the survey are
recommended ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Many of these are limited surface
manifestations, consisting primarily of initial lithic raw materials procurement and reduction,
without an accompanying subsurface extent. Eligibility recommendations are not offered for two
sites; site 41ZP939 falls largely outside lands under the jurisdiction of the USIBWC, and site
41ZP766 was mostly inundated at the time of the survey and could not be evaluated. Fifteen sites
are considered of unknown eligibility; until such time as these sites are further assessed for
significance, these sites should be preserved and protected.
Upon completion of the project, all materials related to this project will be transferred to the
Center for Archaeological Research, University of Texas at San Antonio, for permanent curation
and storage.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report discusses the results of archaeological survey of 601 acres and the preliminary
reconnaissance assessment of features at previously reported sites in the âCentral Unsurveyed
Areaâ (CUA) and âNorthern Unsurveyed Areaâ (NUA) of Falcon Reservoir in Zapata County,
Texas (Figure 1). Archaeologists from Camp Dresser and McKee (CDM) and Geo-Marine, Inc.
(GMI), conducted the investigations under contract to the United States Section of the
International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) under Contract IBM04D0001, Task
Order IBM05T0019, issued on July 13, 2005.
The International Falcon Dam that forms Falcon Reservoir was developed as a flood control,
conservation, and hydroelectric power source pursuant to a treaty of 1944 between the United
States and Mexico. Construction for the dam began on December 15, 1950, and was completed
on April 8, 1954. As an international cooperative project, the reservoir is jointly managed by the
Mexican and United States Sections of the IBWC, headquartered in the conjoining cities of
Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua and El Paso, Texas, respectively. Each section is responsible for
maintaining its own legal counsel, engineering staff, and administrative staff, and has field offices
situated along the border to operate and maintain joint works.
The dam is located on the Rio Grande, about 130 km (80 mi) downstream from Laredo, Texas,
about 210 km (130 mi) upstream from Brownsville, Texas, and about 255 km (160 mi) above the
mouth of the river at the Gulf of Mexico. Although the dam is located in northern Starr County,
most of the impounded waters in the U.S. occur in Zapata County, Texas. The reservoir has a
normal conservation pool at 301.2 feet (ft) above mean sea level (amsl) and a normal flood
control pool at 306.7 ft amsl. The reservoirâs maximum water capacity is established at 314.2 ft
amsl. At normal capacity (301.2 ft), Falcon Lake typically covers 87,000 acres, and at maximum
flood pool (314.2 ft), it covers 115,400 acres.
More than 800 archaeological sites are documented on properties under the jurisdiction of the
USIBWC at Falcon Reservoir. Some parcels in the NUA and CUA regions, however, have still
not been systematically surveyed, and the present project is part of efforts by the USIBWC to
satisfy archaeological site inventory and eligibility determinations under Section 110 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2004 [16 U.S.C. Â§ 470
et seq.; P.L. 89â665; 80 Stat. 915]. The work reported here was performed under USIBWC
ARPA (Archeological Resources Protection Act [ARPA] of 1979 [16 U.S.C. Â§ 470aa et seq.; P.L.
96â95; 93 Stat. 721]) Permit Nos. 0011 and 0013.

Chapter 1: Introduction

The scope of services changed during the course of the present project. The initial scope
stipulated that the contractor conduct a combined intensive and reconnaissance field survey of
approximately 300 acres in each of two portions of the reservoir, the CUA and the NUA, and the
recovery of archaeological data from three to five features from each of four sites (for a range of
12 to 20 features total). The contractor was to design the areas of survey and choose specific sites
with features to be investigated based on information provided in the recently completed cultural
resources management plan (CRMP; Parsons 2004), or historic ranch lists that are determined
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The goal of the survey was to
systematically locate and, as applicable, identify the limits of archaeological sites, thus further
reducing the acreage for the remaining unsurveyed areas. The areas selected for survey lay along
Arroyo CabaseÃ±a and Arroyo Loma Blanca in the CUA about 21 km (13 mi) south of the town of
Zapata, and along Arroyo Burro and the Rio Grande in the NUA about 15 km (9 mi) north of
Zapata. The goal of the feature assessment and data recovery operation was to extract the
maximum amount of information from the features about age, structure and function before they
are adversely affected by further fluctuating water levels or vandalism.
In order to implement the feature data recovery program, a work plan was developed that
stipulated that crews were to visit previously recorded sites with known features to re-draw site
maps, noting topography, features, associated artifacts, and any adverse affects on the features
from the high water stand. Maps and notes were also made for the surface conditions of the
features, and a shovel test was excavated next to the feature to assess the adjacent sediment
matrix integrity.
This information was then conveyed to resources managers with
recommendations for feature data recovery.
The field portion of the project was conducted in several stages. The initial phase of fieldwork
occurred between November 2 and 11, 2005. During and following this field session, the project
scope was adjusted due to a variety of factors. The contractual aspects of feature data recovery
were deleted and replaced with expansion of survey coverage. Subsequent fieldwork occurred
from October 24 to November 2, and from November 14 to 22, 2006.
Survey of 186 acres in the NUA was conducted during the initial field session. In addition, initial
fieldwork documented a number of sites with features. After the initial field session, resource
managers advocated that the level of effort for feature data recovery be reallocated to expand
survey coverage. Consequently, a second scope of work was produced, reflecting a change to
surveying some 400 acres each in the NUA and the CUA. Once fieldwork was underway again,
however, these tracts for survey were revised to include just 601 acres total, to be split
approximately evenly between the NUA and the CUA.
A total of 39 sites was either revisited and updated or newly recorded during the total course of
the present project. In the NUA, this consisted of 24 archaeological sites recorded (Table 1); one
additional site was later discovered to lie outside the project boundaries and thus on lands outside
the jurisdiction of the USIBWC. Seven of the sites within USIBWC jurisdiction were previously
recorded (Hughes 1950; Parsons 2002), and 17 were newly recorded during the present survey.
Twenty of these sites were recorded as having exclusively prehistoric components; three
previously recorded sites have both a historic and a prehistoric component; and two newly
recorded sites were identified as having components dating to both periods.

Fourteen sites were either newly recorded or their records updated in the CUA (Table 2). Of
these, 12 had been previously recorded (Parsons 2002), and just two were newly documented
during the present survey. During the rerecording of sites in the CUA, substantial changes were
made, such that many previously recorded sites were combined into single manifestations after
careful inspection of the ground surface between sites. As a result, 21 previously recorded sites
in the area were encompassed by five total sites (see Table 2). Additionally, eleven previously
recorded sites in the CUA (41ZP186, 41ZP713, 41ZP714, 41ZP718, 41ZP719, 41ZP742,
41ZP746, 41ZP747, 41ZP749, 41ZP763, and 41ZP777) could not be relocated and are presumed
to be (1) inundated, (2) damaged such that their remains were not identified other than as
occasional isolates, or (3) incorrectly plotted during the original recording. Sites in the CUA
include 13 with exclusively prehistoric components and one with both historic and prehistoric
components.

The laboratory part of the project involved updating the Geographic information system (GIS)
project files for Falcon Reservoir using data collected during fieldwork, updating existing site
forms or producing new site forms using TexSite, the Digital Site Record system for Texas, and
artifact and data analysis. In addition, as part of an agreement in reducing the quantity of
surveyed acreage at the Reservoir, the Falcon Reservoir Cultural Resources Management Plan
(CRMP; Parsons 2004) was updated to reflect additional survey by Hicks and Company (Karbula
et al. 2006) and the present effort by GMI.
This report is organized into six chapters. In Chapter 2, the natural environment of Falcon
Reservoir and the project areas is discussed. Specifically, the geology/geomorphology, soils,
hydrology, climate, flora, and fauna are briefly described to characterize both the archaeological
potential for sites to be found on different landforms in the reservoir and the kinds of plant,
animal, and mineral resources available for use by indigenous populations.
A cultural context for the Falcon Reservoir region is then provided in Chapter 3. A short history
of investigations is first presented, followed by the prehistoric cultural sequences as delineated for
Falcon Reservoir and the adjacent larger regions of South Texas and northeastern Mexico. In
addition, the Protohistoric and early historic periods in the region are also presented, including
some background on aboriginal groups residing in the region, a history of Spanish Colonial
occupations, and changes in settlement due to the development of the reservoir.

The field and laboratory methods used during this project are described in Chapter 4. Methods
used for feature recording and assessment are presented as well as those used for survey and site
recording and laboratory and data analyses. Roles filled by project personnel and discussions of
work performed during each of the three field sessions are also provided.
Chapter 5 presents the results of the initial feature testing and survey. The results of field tasks
conducted in the two project areas are presented separately. Site descriptions and work
conducted on each of the sites, including initial feature evaluations, are provided; site updates are
presented prior to newly recorded sites. The sites are summarized, focusing on the types of
locations in which particular sites are found in each of the two project areas.
Finally, a summary of the survey and feature evaluation activities is presented in Chapter 6.
Recommendations are presented for the specific sites investigated, in some cases building upon,
or contradicting, previous recommendations.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

In this chapter, the general location of the International Falcon Dam and Reservoir project area
and the specific location of the archaeological survey parcels are discussed with regard to their
general environmental settings. Falcon Reservoir is located in Starr and Zapata counties, Texas,
which comprise a part of the Rio Grande Embayment portion of the Gulf Coast Basin
physiographic region in South Texas. In the following pages, the geology and geomorphology,
soils, and hydrology pattern for the project area are discussed. Discussions of the climate, and the
corresponding flora and fauna are then presented. Finally, a summary of the biotic and non-biotic
resources that could have been of potential benefit to prehistoric peoples is discussed.

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Rio Grande of the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Plain is composed of two physiographically
distinct segments, divided at Los EbaÃ±os, Texas (Gustavson and Collins 1998:10). Downstream,
from Los EbaÃ±os to the mouth of the river, is the broad, flat floodplain delta. The segment of the
Rio Grande upstream from Los EbaÃ±osâthe segment along which the project area liesâis
marked by a relatively straight river channel incised about 100 feet (ft 30.5 meters [m]) into the
surrounding Cretaceous and Tertiary strata. The Falcon Reservoir area is downstream from the
deeply incised canyons characteristic of the Big Bend and Lower Pecos regions, but the riverbed
is still moderately incised into relatively soft bedrock, resulting in gently rolling hills near the
river, but occasional deep gullies along tributary channels. In this part of the Gulf of Mexico
Coastal Plain, the basal geology consists primarily of the sandstones and claystones of the Laredo
and Yegua formations (Barnes 1976).
From an archaeological perspective, the presence of clusters of angular sandstone in colors of red
to dark brown can be confused with prehistoric hearth stones; and indeed this seems to have
confused some of the previous archaeological surveyors (see discussions of features from
41ZP815, for example, in Chapter 5). One valuable key to identifying thermally altered bedrock
clusters from archaeological hearths relates to understanding the geomorphic potential, the
landform of the suspected feature, and the age of deposits based on pedogenic developments.

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

The Rio Grande is a relatively old river system, and unlike the delta region, the river in the
vicinity of Falcon Reservoir has remained in place since at least the Pleistocene era.
Accordingly, the valley has a number of cut and fill events. Barnes (1976) merely notes that the
bedrock margins are overlain by Pleistocene age (Quaternary) fluvial deposits composed of
gravels, sands, silts and clays. Due to the size of the Rio Grande drainage basin and the higher
water discharge during the Pleistocene, most fluvial terraces at Falcon contain abundant nodules
of chert (especially brown), agate, jasper, petrified wood, rhyolite, and metaquartzite that range
from cobble to boulder size. These lithic resources were readily used by prehistoric flintknappers for fashioning stone tools.
Early geomorphic studies of the reservoir identify a series of Pleistocene and Holocene age
terraces in the river valley (Evans 1962). Evans (1962) recognizes three named terraces that he
feels are stabilized, and at least two that he believes are still building up with modern flood
deposits. The highest and oldest, called the Reynosa terrace, occurs some 110 to 135 ft (33.5â
41.2 m) above the river channel as it was in 1950. That terrace is characterized by an extensive
silt- and caliche-capped gravel deposit and contains occasional Middle Pleistocene mammalian
fossils indicative of its period of formation. The Reynosa terrace commonly contains the range of
cherts and other lithic resources sought by prehistoric people to make stone tools.
The Zapata terrace is located about 65 ft (19.8 m) above the 1950-river channel and contains
some 25â30 ft (7.6â9.1 m) of light grayish tan silts overlying basal gravels eroded from the
Reynosa terrace. The occurrence of mammoth remains at the base of the terrace suggests that it
began its constructional phase during the Late Pleistocene. Evans (1962) suggests that the
density of buried archaeological middens and lithic sites in the Zapata Formation indicates that it
temporally spanned a large part of the Holocene.
The Rosita terrace is located about 45 ft (13.7 m) above the 1950-river channel. It is
discontinuous and occurs as remnants in a few places, especially near the village of Rosita in
Starr County. These sediments are light tan and are well-bedded silts that are practically
indistinguishable from those in the Zapata terrace. No clear temporal assignment is given to the
Rosita terrace, but Evans (1962) indicated that portions of it were contemporaneous with the
Zapata terrace. The potential for buried archaeological remains is high.
The Rio Grande floodplain surface occurs about 30 ft (9 m) above the 1950-river channel. Evans
claims that this terrace is still undergoing constructional development and the sediments tend to
be less compact and sandier than those of the Rosita or Zapata terraces. He saw no artifacts
buried in the modern floodplain deposits; however, in one of his report figures, he depicts 3.6 and
6.1 m (12â20 ft) tall âbenchesâ in the sides of the floodplain, which are suggestive of temporally
distinct erosional cut and terrace building fill events.
According to Evans, then, any archaeological remains on top of the Reynosa terrace should
represent surface a palimpsest from all human occupations, and it should have no potential to
contain buried archaeological remains. The Zapata, Rosita, and modern terraces, essentially
including all deposits below an elevation of 65 ft (19.8 m) from the modern river channel, have
the potential to contain buried archaeological remains. However, two other studies suggest that
the geomorphic record of Falcon Reservoir is even more complex.

8

Chapter 2: Environmental Setting

Gustavson and Collins (1998) conducted a geomorphic reconnaissance of the Rio Grande terraces
from Amistad Reservoir to the Rio Grande delta to search for allostratigraphic units that would
permit correlation of landform across large segments of the river. In the non-delta region above
Los EbaÃ±os (at the Starr-Hildalgo County boundary) they recognized a low (2â5 m), medium (8â
12 m) and high (18â20 m) terrace sequence that roughly corresponds to the elevations of Evansâs
floodplain benches (3.6 and 6.1 m), the Rosita (13.7 m) and Zapata (19.8 m) terraces,
respectively. However, backhoe trenches dug into these units failed to find major or consistent
breaks as noted by truncations of paleosols or other erosional surfaces. Based largely on this
geomorphic evidence coupled with historical flood information, they conclude that flooding
within the past 75 years has occasionally overtopped even the highest of the three terraces. The
significance is that all Holocene terrace surfaces continue to aggrade or are still in a
constructional mode. There is no evidence for cycles of valley filling and downcutting. The
higher terraces just receive sediments less frequently than do the lower terrace surfaces. Not only
do buried archaeological remains potentially occur in all surfaces, most importantly, the terraces
can not be confidently used to frame the ages of discrete alluvial depositional packages and their
associated cultural remains. The terraces at Falcon are not allostratigraphic units that are useful
for drawing correlations from one part of the valley to another.
The study does make several other comments relevant to archaeological remains within the
Falcon Reservoir. If zones of gravels are encountered in Holocene deposits within the lower
terrace, for example, then the force of water necessary to transport those cobbles is apt to be too
severe to preserve any cultural remains. Second, since most of the recent deposits on the higher
terraces represent overbank sediments, they are apt to be in the range of fine-grained sands to
clays; therefore, any cobbles encountered in such deposits on higher terraces are apt to be derived
from transport of human origin, particularly if the rocks show thermal discoloration or are
composed of knappable siliceous lithic cobbles.
The Gustavson and Collins (1998) geomorphic reconnaissance study is extremely stimulating, but
it is based on aerial photographic interpretations supplemented with limited field investigations
and backhoe trench documentation. Although the historic records of flooding are undoubtedly
true to some extent, the rates of recent sediment accumulation on the various terrace surfaces are
unknown. The lack of radiocarbon dates does not allow the generation of reliable data on the
thickness of recent deposits or the rates of sedimentation on upland settings. Clearly more studies
are needed to support the claims offered for the geomorphic investigations.
The last geomorphic studies conducted in the vicinity of Falcon Reservoir focus not on the
alluvial terraces but on the patterns of aeolian deposition that occur on the high ridges flanking
the river. Using Evansâs model, some archaeologists have applied conventional wisdom and
assumed that landforms above 65 ft (19.8 m) above the river channel of 1950 are apt to be stable
and not contain buried occupational debris. This conventional wisdom claims that all debris from
human activities on upland surfaces should be confined to shallow deposits on or very near the
surface, and there is no reason to conduct systematic shovel testing at such settings. But
investigations at some Bureau of Land Management (BLM) well pad sites on the high terraces
found that this was not the case. Indeed, systematic shovel testing and backhoe trenching
conducted on high ridges in the vicinity of Arroyo del Tigre near the town site of LopeÃ±o (27 km
[17 mi] south of Zapata; 11 km [7 mi] above Falcon Dam) found that archaeological remains
occurred buried up to a meter or more in depth (Lintz and Quigg 1997). Testing and data
recovery on two proposed well pad sites employed detailed site-specific geomorphic studies and
9

chronometric dating techniques (Lintz and Abbott 1997; Quigg 1999; Quigg and Cordova 1999,
2000). The geomorphic studies by Cordova especially documented a series of sandy mantle
deposits derived from both alluvial (floodwater) and aeolian sources, likely blown from the river
bottom and deposited on the higher knolls. These studies also suggest that the aeolian deposits
can represent complex strata as some deposits are blown out and subsequently reburied.
Due to poor preservation of charcoal, bone, and other organic remains, the chronometric studies
dated charcoal where available, but also relied on dating the ever-present Rabdotus snail shells,
and lipid residues derived from inside burned sandstone rocks in feature contexts. The snail
shells were frequently used to temporally sequence the geomorphic strata since they could be
gathered from near stratigraphic boundaries. The other materials were used to date the buried
cultural features and occupation zones. The radiocarbon dates generally indicated that the sandy
mantle sediments date less than 8,000 years before present (B.P.), and most of the cultural
occupation zones buried by 50 to 70 centimeters (cm) of deposits dated in the range of 3,000 to
5,000 years old (Quigg 1999:4â4). In some cases, the radiocarbon dates on buried snail shells
yielded ages incongruous with the degree of carbonate development in the sediments, but these
were generally attributed to the redeposition of older snails into alluvial blow-out basins that
formed in the upland sandy mantles (Quigg and Cordova 1999:5â10). The associated
archaeological studies document that termites, ants and other insects have largely reworked the
fine particles on sites, but burned rock feature concentrations retained considerable integrity.
Therefore, artifact assemblages can be isolated within occupation zones in the uplands around
Falcon Reservoir.
In summary, the geomorphological studies have shown that both overbank fluvial deposits and
aeolian deposits can bury archaeological remains within the vicinity of Falcon Reservoir. In
general, regions covered in dense gravel accumulations are apt to be Pleistocene in age.
Although such lag gravels might represent lithic procurement areas, such surfaces will not have
potential for buried archaeological remains. On the other hand, those upland areas covered with
fine sediments have the potential to contain buried sites.
As a final thought, these geomorphic studies have demonstrated that both the aeolian and alluvial
sediments are apt to be in the texture range of fine sand to silt and clay. However, some beds of
the middle Laredo Formation (Eocene) also constitute the same range of textures. Archaeologists
can generally recognize the difference between the pre-Holocene unconsolidated silts/clays
without archaeological potential and the Holocene silts/clays due to the degree of color
differentiation and mottling. The Holocene sediments formed by either alluvial or aeolian
deposits will be more homogenous in color than the Eocene deposits, which will generally be
strongly mottled in red-orange and gray; in addition, some bedrock areas may be capped with
larger gravels that are not common in the Holocene deposits.
The CUA survey area, located only some 18.5 km (11.5 mi) above the Falcon Dam, only provides
access to the higher terrace deposits, whereas the NUA, located some 51 km (32 mi) above the
dam, contains a broader suite of terrace surfaces. Due to the lack of detailed topographic maps
from the reservoir basin, it is generally not possible to correlate accurately the accessible
landscapes to the three terraces as identified by Evans or Collins.

Chapter 2: Environmental Setting

SOILS
No detailed soil manual has been published for Zapata County. However, general soil maps exist
for Zapata County (http:/riogrande.tamu.edu/php; Zapata County Interactive Mapping Service).
Undoubtedly, greater soil differentiation exists across the basin, but the boundaries of the soil
series units have yet to be published in detail. Due to differences in the degree of reservoir
inundation between the two survey areas, more diversity in classifications is present in the NUA
than in the CUA.
Three soil associations are recognized in the NUA region due to lower water impoundment and
exposure of different geological deposits. The Rio Grande-Lagloria-Reynosa soil association
corresponds to Pleistocene terraces; these generally occur north of Arroyo Burro and extend as
floodplain soil to the community of San Ygnacio. Most of these are characterized as fine silts,
and loams without well-developed carbonates.
The Zapata-Maverick-Catrina soil association exists as a relatively narrow band corresponding to
the western edge of the Laredo Geological Formation. In the NUA, these occur near the mouth of
Arroyo Burro and they comprise all of the survey areas in the CUA region along the Loma
Blanca and CabaseÃ±a arroyos. These soils consist of fine silts and loams with some gravel
deposits capping upland regions.
The Copita-Ramadero-Zapata soil association is only found in the NUA region, especially along
the upper reaches of Arroyo Burro. It does not occur in the CUA as presently mapped. This soil
association is composed of deep to very shallow upland sands, silts, and clays overlying
sandstone bedrock deposits. Some sediments may be capped with lag gravels of various cherts,
agates, and quartzites from Pleistocene and older deposits.

HYDROLOGY
The Rio Grande forms the principal drainage within the region. With headwaters in southern
Colorado and bisecting the state of New Mexico, the river is never dry. As the geomorphic
studies by Gustavson and Collins (1998) suggest, the Rio Grande valley near Zapata and Starr
counties is relatively narrow and incised into Tertiary bedrock. The average slope of the river
decreases about 0.4 m/km (26 in/mi.). Periodic flood events, especially associated with
hurricanes, have been known to raise the level of the river more than 20 m (65 ft).
Fourteen relatively short lateral tributaries join the Rio Grande in the vicinity of Falcon Reservoir
on the United States side. Between the community of San Ygnacio on the north and Falcon on
the south, these lateral creeks are: Arroyo Burro, Chapote Creek Arroyo Molletes, Arroyo
Ranchitos, Arroyo San Bartolo, Arroyo Veleno, Arroyo Leon, Arroyo Clareno, Arroyo Loma
Blanca, Arroyo CabaseÃ±a, Arroyo del Tigre Grande (also called Beckwith Arm), Arroyo del
Tigre Chiquito, Arroyo Tinajaca, and Arroyo Medio. These tributaries range from 2 to 42 km (2
to 26 mi.) in length, but the heads of most (79 percent) creeks are less than 13 km (8 mi) from the
Rio Grande. They are spaced from 1.5 to 10 km (1 to 6 mi.) apart, and generally enter the main
river at nearly right angles, except for Arroyo del Tigre Grande, Arroyo del Tigre Chiquito, and
Arroyo Tinajaca, which converge before entering the Rio Grande. Most creeks are presently siltfilled and usually contain water after rain events. Due to their short drainage basins and the low
amounts of rainfall (51 cm/year), few of these drainages carry water.
11

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

For purposes of the present project, the CUA includes segments of the Rio Grande and the
Arroyo Loma Blanca, and the Arroyo CabaseÃ±a drainages. These are 5.1 and 3.2 km (3.2 and 2
mi) long respectively. The NUA includes the Rio Grande terraces and the Arroyo Burro
drainage, which is 25.6 km (8 mi) long. The majority of these drainages occur above the 307-ft
traverse and the 314-ft easement regions, however.
The Rio Grande offers a relatively lush corridor for obtaining water-related resources. Very few
water-filled drainages cross the South Texas region between the Rio Grande and the Nueces
River, which is located some 160 km (100 mi) north of the Rio Grande. Nonetheless, early
topographic maps prepared in 1927 by the U.S. Army Topographic Services also show the
presence of a few natural âwater holesâ as springs in the uplands (McCulloch et al. 2001:79 [e.g.
Porcion 18, 320 ft elevation]). Some of these upland seeps hold water year-round and do not
drain into any of the adjacent rivers. These watering holes along ridge divides were critically
important to hunters and gatherers conducting foraging activities away from the Rio Grande.
Their occurrence high on the landscape in areas away from arroyo settings suggests that people
were not always âtetheredâ to the Rio Grande. Hunters and gatherers had opportunities to obtain
water away from river channels, but it remains to be documented how these resources affected
their settlement pattern. The distribution of such watering holes is not known for the region.

CLIMATE
Zapata, Texas, and its immediate environs are considered to be subtropical-subhumid, with an
average of 318 sunny days per year, and 59 days during which there is measurable precipitation
(Zapata County Chamber of Commerce 2005). The average rainfall in the region is about 51 cm
(20 inches) per year, with moisture peaks in May and September. This amount of moisture is
well below the evapo-transpiration rate, so the overall effect is a net loss of moisture. The
average temperature is 12o C (55.2o F) in January and 30o C (86.4o F) in July. The region has an
average of 304 frost-free growing days, with extreme cold weather and snow being rare. The
prevailing winds are from the southeast throughout the year; with an average wind speed of 12
mph.

FLORA
Some biologists have suggested that the vegetation of South Texas was originally grassland and
that with the overgrazing following the introduction of livestock with the initial Spanish
colonization and through fire suppression the region was transformed into thorny brush
communities (Bogusch 1952). However, early historic records, including the narratives of
Cabeza de Vaca, in 1535 describe the region as a place where thorny vegetation was dense
(Campbell and Campbell 1981). This suggests that brushy species were present through the
historic era. If vegetation succession occurred due to ranching, then it involved a possible shift
from a mesquite prairie to a mesquite/brush-covered region (Johnson 1963).
The arid region is composed of relatively thick scrub brush. In order to reduce animal
consumption and prevent loss of moisture, most plants have developed leathery or waxy surfaces,
sticky thorns, and/or unpalatable tastes. Presently, the vegetation community consists of a xeric
12

Chapter 2: Environmental Setting

blackbrush/Texas ebony/ mesquite scrubland. Much of the brush grows relatively tall and closes
in some 1â1.2 m (3â4 ft) above the ground with prickly shrubs; often few plants actually cover
the ground. Thus, visibility of artifacts is usually good, but maintaining archaeological survey
transect lines is often difficult.
The upland ridges and hills have an overstory of spiny hackberry, guayacan, Texas ebony and
honey mesquite (the latter two are both legumes with edible bean-pods). The underbrush is
composed mostly of blackbrush acacia, leather stem, coyotillo, brasil, retama, huisache, cenizo,
goat brush, lotebush, and Texas kidney wood. Cactus is common and is represented by prickly
pear, tasajillo, echinocereus, and horse crippler. Yucca also grows in places. Much of the ground
surface is bare, but in select spots, usually shaded by trees, sparse quantities of grass curly
mesquite grow.
During high water retention episodes in the reservoir, moisture from the lake percolates through
the sediments above the 307-ft elevation and stimulates plant growth corresponding to a zone just
above the maximum high water stands. Comparable growth does not occur at lower elevations
because in some areas the fine sediments have been washed away, and in other areas, periodic
high stands of water inundate and kill the vegetation. The dense vegetation usually consists of
rattlebrush, retama, and huisache.
Common edible wild plants include seedpods from mesquite, Texas ebony, huisache, retama,
blackbush acacia, and rattlebrush. In addition, the fruit (tuna) and pads of cactus, especially
prickly pear, are also edible. Yucca flowers and fruit are also edible. Except for maguey, few
kinds of edible tubers are known in this region.

FAUNA
This part of south Texas is within the Tamaulipan biotic province (Blair 1950). Common animals
include 61 species of mammals, 36 species of snake, 19 species of lizards, two types of land
terrapins, 19 species of frogs and toads, and 3 species of newts and salamanders. The region is
home to 275 species of birds on a seasonal basis (Arvin 1977). The Rio Grande contains many
kinds of fish and freshwater mussels.
The most common mammals include the opossum, armadillo, two kinds of cottontail and blacktailed jack rabbits, ground squirrels, pocket gophers, and various mice and rodents. The larger
omnivores and carnivores include raccoon, coyote, badgers, skunks, bobcats, and mountain lion.
Larger hoofed animals include the collared peccary and white-tailed deer (Whitaker 1993). In the
past, herds of bison were historically recorded in the region.

RESOURCE POTENTIAL
The Rio Grande segment in the vicinity of Falcon Reservoir had a wide range of resources useful
to indigenous hunter-gatherers. The climate was generally warm to hot, with relatively low
amounts of rainfall. Even though few natural caves and shelters were present, the climate did not
typically require tremendous investments in constructing substantial buildings. For hunters and
gatherers, small brush huts were adequate for much of the year. Water was always abundant in
13

the Rio Grande and in a few upland seep springs, but it was not often found in the hilly country
between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River. Much of the vegetation tended to be sticky, but
with adequate clothing, thorns presented few problems. After all, Cabeza de Vaca traversed the
area in the 1530s in almost a naked state of dress (Krieger 2002).
The upland terraces contain an abundance of cobbles composed of quality chert, agate, petrified
wood, quartzite, and rhyolite that are easily knapped into a range of stone implements. These
stone tools were used to harvest a variety of plant resources, including woods for making
perishable goods ranging from sandals to shelters. Insofar as few grinding implements have been
recovered from prehistoric sites, it seems likely that edible legume beans and pods were pounded
in wooden mortar and pestles. Stone cobbles also served as heating elements in stone boiling or
griddle cooking activities; other stones were used as heating elements in hearths for a wide range
of activities. The region also has a great diversity of animals. Many of the larger animals could
have been procured by atlatl darts, spears, and later by bows and arrows; the smaller game might
have been caught in wooden snares or deadfalls. In proximity to the river, resource availability
might have favored mobile foraging bands over their more sedentary kindred in other regions of
Texas.
Although the Spanish Colonial settlers found a land with relatively broad floodplains suitable for
conducting limited agriculture, the main focus was on sheep and cattle ranching. The colonialists
maintained their connections with economies in Mexico, and they brought in metal implements to
replace the stone tools and majolica ceramics. Early transportation routes probably mirrored
aboriginal trails and horses and wagons expanded the range of goods brought to the region.
Initial structures were probably made of adobe brick or wattle and daub materials made from
locally available trees, but the large wooden vigas used in framing the house roofs most assuredly
had to be imported.

ENVIRONMENTAL ALTERATIONS FROM RESERVOIR DEVELOPMENT
The construction of Falcon Dam in 1950 and the filling of the reservoir in 1953 brought widespread environmental changes to the region. These historical changes have profound implications
for the visibility, preservation, and integrity of archaeological resources, and are worth discussing
in some detail.
Although the initial filling was anticipated to take several years, two flood events filled the
reservoir to capacity within a few months after completion. On the U.S. side, the federal
government prepared for the initial reservoir filling and inundation of the communities and
rancheros in the flood basin by constructing a new road segment some two to three miles north of
the original U.S. Highway 83 and by establishing the water, electrical, and transportation
infrastructure for replacement towns built next to the new highway. The government also sent
land appraisers to all families to be affected by the reservoir to determine fair market value of
property and improvements. Detailed maps of many homesteads were made with notes on the
nature of every structure and feature at occupied sites as documentation for objectively justifying
land acquisition prices. Offers were made to resettle people in new communities above the
reservoir flood pool, and several communities, such as new Zapata and LopeÃ±a, were established
by such efforts. Most landowners within the flood pool on the U.S. side received monetary
compensation for their property and improvements well ahead of dam closure.
14

Chapter 2: Environmental Setting

The masonry buildings constructed during the Spanish Colonial period could not be moved.
Many of these old buildings were inundated during the early years when the reservoir filled. But
as the water levels fluctuated, the reemergence of structures was regarded as a health and safety
hazard. During the mid-1960s, a policy was set in motion to destroy these buildings on the U.S.
side of the reservoir, and prior to the passage of laws protecting historic properties, many
buildings were flattened by dynamite. Thus, most Spanish Colonial town sites and rancheros on
the U.S. side have masonry rubble piles, whereas town sites, such as Old Guerrero or Revilito on
the Mexican side, are largely intact.
Also during the initial land acquisition phase, the real estate appraisers documented some 1,700
graves from 24 well-established cemeteries in the reservoir basin in preparation for cemetery
removal (Parsons 2004:Attachment 7.3). The number of individual graves per cemetery range
from four at the Rincon Ranch Cemetery to more than 500 interments at Old Zapata Cemetery.
The USIBWC prepared detailed maps of each cemetery and tabulated the condition and means of
marking each burial plot; the names and vital statistics were recorded for each grave. That the
USIBWC was able to obtain names on nearly 80 percent of these 1,700 graves suggests that most
were probably interred within the preceding 50 or so years and that oral interviews might have
complemented the information listed on headstones. Two hundred and fifty years of Spanish
Colonial settlement in the region suggests that many unmarked graves are very likely to occur at
these documented cemeteries and near the older abandoned ranchero sites. The Hispanic cultural
view that cemeteries represent family claims to their original lands contributed to many peopleâs
refusal of government offers to have their relativeâs remains reinterred prior to reservoir
inundation. The reservoir filling has resulted in the inundation of several hundred graves.
Over the past half century, great fluctuations in rainfall, the construction of other upstream dams
along the Rio Grande and other tributaries, and treaty requirements that set the rate of water
release from Falcon Dam for hydroelectric and irrigation use on the Rio Grande delta have
resulted in considerable water level fluctuation in the reservoir. Records maintained at Falcon
Dam for a recent 19-year period (1979 to 1997) show that the water level reached the high water
301-ft conservation pool four times (McCullough et al. 2001: Figure 2). During this 19-year
interval, the water levels of the lake were at maximum capacity for not longer than 1.5 years at a
time. Four drawdown periods lasted from (1) early 1980 to mid-1981, (2) from mid-1982 to mid1987, (3) from early 1989 to late-1992, and (4) from early 1993 to beyond the range of the 1997
records. During the latter three drawdown periods, the shoreline water levels reached maximum
depths of 35 ft, 25 ft, and 50 ft, respectively, below the 307-ft conservation pool level. These
fluctuations have affected development within the region and the conditions of historic properties
on federal lands.
Most landowners retained their property above the 307-ft flood-pool elevation and the
government secured flowage easements for property rights from the 307-ft traverse taking line to
the 314-ft elevation. Despite the improvements of new communities established along the
realigned U.S. Hwy 83, the federal government constructed few roads from the rerouted highway
to the lakeshore. The periodic low water stands render boat launch ramps as ineffective and
useless; such ramps tend to be few and far apart. Similarly, almost no roadways were constructed
near or around the shoreline to promote development. Consequently, access from the public
highways to the federally-owned and managed shoreline property usually crosses several miles of
private lands that are mostly retained by heirs of the older families. Indeed, with the tremendous
fluctuations in water level elevations historically, public interest in developing settlements and
15

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

home sites along the shoreline is very low. This means that many sections of the reservoir are not
readily accessible through privately-owned properties on the land side. Furthermore, the great
distances between functioning boat launch sites means large time-consuming efforts to reach
areas by boat. The process of repeated inundations has also affected the conditions of cultural
resource properties.
Since sediments in rivers settle out as the velocity of water decreases in a reservoir setting, Falcon
Reservoir is filling with silt, especially in the deepest part of the original channel. The effects of
water level fluctuations also alter the environment in many ways along the lake margins. During
periods of high water stands, as happened at the initial filling and subsequent periodic intervals,
the rising water inundated vegetation and drowned all submerged terrestrial species. The deeper
root system and dense woody structure of mesquite and Texas ebony mean that the drowned trees
died, but they remain in place as woody skeletons. Smaller brushy plants with shallow root
systems decomposed or were uprooted by shoreline wave actions with the repeated rising and
falling of the lake levels. This lack of understory vegetation cover caused enhanced surface
visibility and gully erosion on exposed beaches; the extent of erosion varies considerably and is
tied to sediment texture and slope exposure.
An unanticipated effect of periodic high water stands is due to capillary action that draws water
uphill for short distances through the silty topsoil above the wave-action zone of the conservation
pool. This saturation zone occurs just above the 307-foot (ft) elevation in many parts of the
reservoir. Since it is dependent on the sediment texture that affects the rates of capillary action,
this zone is not uniform around the margins of the basin. Where capillary action has created a
saturation zone the vegetation communities have responded with faster, higher, and denser
growth than the communities in areas not receiving constant water during high stand intervals. In
many places, this zone of dense brush may be only 15â20 m wide, but it is a permanent mark on
the landscape. Ground visibility in such vegetation zones is drastically reduced and disturbance
of subsurface sediments is accelerated from the density of roots in this relatively narrow zone.
This makes archaeological survey in some areas difficult due to the dense brush and poor surface
visibility; but the dense vegetation enhances habitats of some endangered mammals.
As the lake levels rise and fall, wave actions adversely affect the deposits in several ways. The
intensity of waves at any point on the reservoir varies according to slope and aspect of the
particular landform and the size of the adjacent body of water. Since waves are primarily formed
by wind speed over a body of water, shoreline areas down-wind of larger water bodies are
subjected to larger waves than protected areas in lateral tributaries. The size of waves is also
dependent upon the depth and slope of the lake bottom; thus, shorelines along gently sloping and
shallow lake bottom areas will have attenuated or smaller waves than shorelines next to areas
with deeper water next to steep slopes. Finally, portions of the reservoir where the river channel
was oblique or perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction will not generate the magnitude of
waves that form in areas with longer exposure to winds. Since elevated ridges and brush
diminish winds, waters impounded along lateral tributaries will generally not have as severe
waves impacts as areas next to open bodies of water. The important point is that wave impacts
vary greatly from one part of the reservoir to another, and the adverse effects of waves on
archaeological deposits are equally variable.

16

Chapter 2: Environmental Setting

Waves and currents cause shoreline erosion and suspension of fine particles. The pounding of
waves churns up fine silt sediments from a âwave erosion zoneâ and transports them by
suspension to a âsediment deposition zoneâ in deeper parts of the reservoir. Thus, areas with
prolonged, intensive wave action will tend to be stripped of fine sediments or, under more severe
conditions, the coarse sands, pebbles, and artifacts may be reworked into beach strandlines.
Features and archaeological deposits are often destroyed in the wave erosion zones and
archaeological remains in such settings will retain no contextual integrity.
On gently sloping surfaces that were quickly inundated, however, sediments may shift slightly
downslope to a âsediment deposition zoneâ or not move at all. Sometimes, sediments from
shallower deposits can bury archaeological remains under layers of silt and enhance the
preservation of their contextual integrity. During reservoir drawdown events, such buried sites
may have little to no surficial evidence, for burrowing rodents tend to be slow in re-colonizing
areas after lake drawdown events; consequently, artifacts are not brought to the surface. Such
buried sites in fine sediments on gently sloping surfaces may retain integrity despite inundation,
but their surficial signatures might be hard to recognize since they are represented by sparse
surficial artifact expressions.
Above the reservoir inundation zones that occur between 307 and 314 ft amsl, studies by Quigg
and Cordova (1999, 2000) have shown that archaeological sites along upland ridges may be
buried by a meter or more of Holocene alluvial, aeolian, and colluvial sediments. Therefore,
unless the surface is âarmoredâ by Pleistocene terrace lag gravels or shows the strongly mottled
coloration of Miocene and Eocene fine sediments, it is possible that buried intact archaeological
remains occur on upland terrace ridges.
Since the historic introduction of livestock grazing, some have argued that the South Texas
grasslands have shifted to thorny scrublands. Such a transformation must have involved erosion
of considerable quantities of sediments from hillsides that have filled the lateral arroyo channels.
As a result, there is a low potential to find archaeological remains using shallow shovel testing
tactics in modern gully channel areas. Better preservation occurs along arroyo channel terrace
margins and in aeolian sediment-covered hillslopes and tops.
The results of the tremendous variability of water levels at Falcon Reservoir have been manifold.
The increased surface visibility shortly after the drop of water levels has enhanced surface artifact
visibility, eroded historic and prehistoric graves, and reexposed Spanish Colonial farmsteads and
communities. Falcon Reservoir has developed a reputation among artifact collectors and looters
as a spot yielding copious amounts of archaeological remains (Hester 1996; Perttula and Boyd
1988; Perttula et al. 1996). Some of the ranges of artifact types collected by avocational
collectors from Falcon are highlighted in the next chapter. In an effort to stem the looting and
vandalism, the USIBWC has initiated surveys and developed a management plan to help guide
the decision-making process for managing historic properties on its lands.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

In this chapter, the archaeological manifestations identified during the 2005â2006 GMI survey
are placed into a larger context. First, previous archaeological studies in the region, with
particular emphasis on Falcon Reservoir, are summarized. The considerable work conducted in
the region focused primarily on survey; thus, few sites have been tested to assess eligibility or
significance. Second, a culture history for South Texas and adjacent regionsâincluding northern
Mexicoâis presented, and our knowledge of both the prehistoric and historic eras is summarized.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
South Texas archaeology has long been regarded as tierra incognita due to the lack of
professional archaeological interest in the region throughout the first half of the twentieth century.
Amateur archaeologists, such as A. E. Anderson, amassed a large collection of decorated marine
shell artifacts mostly from the coastal areas along the Rio Grande delta (Anderson 1932). His
large collection of exotic materials drew the attention of such archaeologists as J. Alden Mason
(n.d.) from Pennsylvania and E. B. Sayles (1935) from Arizona, among others, during the 1930s.
Sayles prepared the first major synthesis of cultures in Texas and defined two cultural groups for
the lower Rio Grande region: The Brownsville phase represents the coastal region at the mouth
of the river and is characterized by the exotic decorative shells in the Anderson collection. The
second culture defined by Sayles stretched from Eagle Pass to Hidalgo along the Rio Grande and
was called the Coahuiltecan phase. Saylesâs Coahuiltecan phase encompasses the present project
area. Sayles, however, presents the grand synthesis with little site-specific documentation and
employs a hypothetical, linguistic-based cultural classification. As a result, few archaeologists
embraced his cultural designations.
Archaeology above the delta where the river has entrenched into the valley floor was not an area
of particular interest. Perhaps, this lack of prehistoric studies stemmed from the rather closed and
conservative nature of communities whose residents trace their family histories back to Hispanic
settlements of the mid-1700s. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that this region was not along the
main transportation routes between major cities in Mexico and the United States, and the
economy for many was too marginal hillslopes for concerns about archaeology. The marginality
of the area in relation to major infrastructure developments likely contributed to the lack of
intensive professional archaeological studies occurring in the stretch between Reynosa and
Laredo until the proposed development of Falcon Reservoir in the 1940s.
19

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Following development of the 1944 water treaties between Mexico and the United States, a series
of reservoirs was proposed along the common border. In the United States, funding for
archaeological studies was conducted through the River Basin Survey Program and administered
in Texas through the University of Texas at Austin. An archaeological reconnaissance of the dam
footprint on the Mexican side of the reservoir (Aveleyra Arroyo de Anda 1951) was also
conducted. Krieger and Hughes (1950) recorded 55 archaeological sites during the initial survey,
but their work was concentrated near the dam and spillway at the south end of the reservoir, near
their camp around Zapata in the central-to-northern part of the reservoir, and along Old U.S. Hwy
83 as it closely paralleled the river on nearby uplands. Their survey work was followed by
excavations at a limited number of the recorded sites. Extensive excavations of deeply stratified
prehistoric sites and Spanish Colonial sites were conducted in the early 1950s (Cason 1952;
Hartle and Stephenson 1951; Jelks 1952).
Following closure of the reservoir, professional archaeological studies rarely occurred in the
region. However, when the lake levels began to fluctuate, avocational collectors noticed an
abundance of archaeological remains along the shoreline. Word spread about the discoveries of
many kinds of stone points and occasional exotic remains and human burials from the Falcon
Reservoir area. For a while, the lake had a reputation as a fine place to find artifacts (Perttula and
Boyd 1988). Over the years many amateur reports have documented a wide variety of projectile
points, ranging from metal arrowheads (Chandler and Krumpe 1996b) and stone tipped arrows
(Boyd, 1997f, 1997h; Hester 2002b; Krumpe et al. 2000; Saunders and Hester 1993) to large dart
points (Saunders 1985) and Paleo-Indian points (Boyd 1997i; Chandler and Krumpe 1994b,
1997a; Parker 1977). Other documented chipped stone tools included lithic caches (Chandler and
Krumpe 1996b; Hester and Wilson 2004) and Clear Fork gouges (Chandler 1994). Ground stone
tools found at Falcon Reservoir include mortars, pestles, metates (Boyd 1996a, 1996b; Chandler
and Krumpe 1997), stone abraders (Boyd 1997g), tubular pipes (Chandler 1996, 1997; Chandler
and Krumpe 1994c), and stone ornaments (Chandler and Krumpe 1994a). Decorated freshwater
and marine shell ornaments have been reported also (Boyd 1998a, 1998b; Chandler and Krumpe
1992, 1995). Other specialized studies have documented trade obsidian from Mexico and
sourcing Tejano and Spanish Colonial pottery (Hester et al. 1996; Neff et al. 2004).
In addition to these wide ranging artifact types, avocationalists wrote reports regarding site types,
open sites and rockshelters (Boyd 1996d, 2004a, 2004b), rock alignments (Boyd 1976b), and rock
art (Boyd 1999). Other studies have focused on historic sites and artifacts (Boyd 1997c, 1997d;
Perttula 2003; Perttula et al. 1999). Many reports have focused on the occurrence of human
remains exposed in the reservoir basin (Boyd 1996c, 1997e, 2000, 2004c; Boyd and Perttula
2001, Boyd and Wilson 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002; Boyd et al. 1997; Hester 1997; Hester et al.
2000; Perttula 2001; Wilson and Hester 1996).
During the height of water drawdown in the reservoir and the ensuing vandalism occurring at
sites in the early 1990s, concerns of professional archaeologists led to the development of a
program for managing the archaeological resources of the reservoir (Hester 1996; Perttula and
Boyd 1988; Perttula et al. 1996). Limited funds were made available for pedestrian surveys of
shorelines and the preparation of segments of management plans (McCulloch et al. 2001; OâNeill
et al. 1992; Turnbow and Holmes 1995; Warren 1995). These studies ultimately led to a
sustained survey program that resulted in the CRMP (Parsons 2004).

20

Chapter 3: Cultural Context

A few professional archaeological studies of Falcon Reservoir occurred in conjunction with the
development of the State Park (Davis 1994; McCulloch and Warren 1998; Warren 1994). With
the advent of mineral resource developments, numerous archaeological reconnaissances (without
shovel testing) and surveys (with shovel testing) were conducted of seismic lines, well pads,
pipelines, and compressor station sites (Lintz and Abbott 1997; Lintz and Quigg 1999;
McCulloch et al. 2001; McCulloch and Warren 1995; Warren 1990, 1992; Warren and Houk
1994). Although many of these surveys recorded archaeological sites with abundant âdiagnostic
points,â few of these diagnostic specimens were found in buried contexts and none of these
projects processed radiocarbon dates or took even the most basic steps necessary to develop a
cultural framework for the area. Most of what we know about Falcon Reservoir is derived from
comparisons of artifacts from the area with those in surrounding regions that have come from
securely dated contexts.
Two exceptions, however, relate to intensive testing and data recovery excavations conducted at
proposed gas well sites near the Beckwidth Arm or Arroyo del Tigre areas (Quigg and Cordova
1999, 2000; Quigg 1999). These studies integrated significant geomorphic studies of upland
settings and demonstrated that aeolian deposits exist above alluvial sediments and that some sites
are buried by a meter or more of sediments. They also processed nearly 50 radiocarbon dates on
land snail shells, charcoal, and conducted pioneering studies of lipid residues inside burned rocks
from feature contexts to show that upland occupations extend back 5,000 to 7,200 years (Quigg
2003). Other studies of opal phytoliths, carbon and nitrogen isotopes, lipid residue identification
inside burned rocks from features, and high power use-wear analysis provide the first efforts
toward reconstructing the past environmental conditions, subsistence activities, and site function
activities tied to empirical observations. These studies are important in showing that even though
charcoal is rare and bone is nearly nonexistent in open-air sites, much can be learned about the
archaeology of the region. The culmination of these studies indicates that the Lower Rio Grande
tool complexes are culturally distinct from those more commonly found north of the Nueces
River. As such, the cultural sequence usually portrayed for South Texas (cf. Hester 1980, 1995;
Hester et al. 1989) tends to draw too heavily on the Central Texas sequence. Recent studies of
burial practices across south Texas reinforce the distinctiveness of the Rio Grande region
(Perttula 2001). The follow provides a brief overview of the culture history applicable to the
region.
Most of the previously recorded sites updated during the present survey were originally recorded
by Parsons and others (Parsons 2002; Parsons and LopezGarcia Group 2004). In 2001â2002,
archaeologists with Wendy Lopez & Associates, conducted a reconnaissance survey of 2,486
acres in the CUA and NUA (Parsons 2002). This survey resulted in the documentation of 142
newly recorded sites and two previously recorded sites (41ZP81, 41ZP183). In 2003,
reconnaissance survey of an additional 2,002 acres within the NUA and CUA was conducted
(Parsons and LopezGarcia Group 2004). Forty-nine previously unrecorded archaeological sites
were recorded and four previously recorded sites were revisited ([41ZP3, 41ZP81, 41ZP82, and
41ZP812].
The 307-ft traverse taking line of the two study areas (Parsons 2002; Parsons and LopezGarcia
Group 2004) was incorporated into the existing ArcView GIS project and maps. The purpose of
this effort was to provide USIBWC a planning and management tool. The 307-ft taking line was
compiled from three sources: real property maps from the USIBWC headquarters in El Paso,
Texas; on-site survey of original 307-ft taking line survey monuments at Falcon Reservoir; and
21

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

conversion of metes and bounds data from the original survey. No single source was complete,
but each could be used to supplement the others to obtain a complete line for the study area.
Incorporation of the 307-ft traverse taking line into the GIS database for the NUA showed that
three previously identified archaeological sites below 307 ft in elevation are actually outside the
traverse taking line: 41ZP810, 41ZP812, and 41ZP819.
Another more recent survey was conducted by Hicks and Company (Karbula et al. 2006). During
fieldwork conducted in July 2005, archaeologists surveyed a total of 375 acres, 178 of which
were in the NUA and 197 acres in the CUA. Three previously unrecorded archaeological sites
(41ZP919, 41ZP920, and 41ZP921) were identified in the NUA parcel. No previously recorded
sites were located in that survey area. A single previously unrecorded site, 41ZP922, was
recorded in the CUA. In addition, documentation was updated for 15 previously recorded sites
(41ZP183, 41ZP724, 41ZP727, 41ZP733, 41ZP734, 41ZP735, 41ZP736, 41ZP753, 41ZP755,
41ZP758, 41ZP759, 41ZP760, 41ZP761, 41ZP763, and 41ZP764).

CULTURE HISTORY
The culture history of the Lower Rio Grande is summarized below, beginning with evidence of
the prehistoric cultural sequence, then by examining the ethnographic conditions and Indian
groups as documented by the earliest explorers, and finally, by examining the historic sequence
with special emphasis on the Falcon region. Much of the following sequence draws from
regional summaries by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954), Black (1989), and Hester (1980, 1995,
2004). Culture histories specific to the Falcon Reservoir area have recently been compiled by
Parsons (2004) and McCulloch and others (1998), and the reader is referred to those publications
for reference.
Archaeological investigations in South Texas have been relatively limited, and it is one of the
least researched areas in the state (Black 1989). Recently, however, there have been a number of
summaries of the prehistoric and historic contexts for the region (e.g., Black 1989; Hester 2004;
Ricklis 2004). In this chapter, a regional chronology, based on these and other resources, as
cited, and a summary of previous archaeological investigations in the Rio Grande valley are
briefly presented (Table 3). Much of the following summary has also been previously presented
(Cooper et al. 2003; Gibbs et al. 2006).

Prehistoric Cultural Sequence
The prehistoric cultural sequence for South Texas is separated into three sequential temporal and
cultural periods: Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric (see Table 3). The dates for this
chronology are based on a comprehensive study of the region conducted by Black (1989).

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period (ca. 9500â6000 B.C.) is generally characterized as the period when small
highly mobile social groups relied heavily upon hunting Late Pleistocene megafauna, though data
for the immediate project area are lacking. In addition, estuarine and coastal resources available

farther downstream near the mouth of the Rio Grande would also likely have been important
resources to Paleo-Indian populations in the region. The hunting emphasis is perhaps a
mischaracterization, as data from other regions across North America now indicate more reliance
on gathering and processing plant species than has previously been recognized.
Paleoenvironmental data for adjacent southcentral Texas to the north of the project area indicate
that temperatures were generally cooler and the climate more humid during that time period than
today (Bousman et al. 1990). Paleo-Indian populations likely hunted extinct species of mastodon,
mammoth, large tortoise, and long-nosed peccary. Other species, such as bison, that are missing
today from South Texas, were probably also used by these populations (Black 1989; Bousman et
al. 1990). Plant data are generally missing from the archaeological record for the period. Though
these regional data are few, indications from nearby regions are that a broad spectrum of both
plants and animals was relied upon.
No Paleo-Indian period sites, nor confirmed isolated finds dating to this period, have been
recorded or reported from within or in the larger vicinity of the project area. A few sites and
isolated finds, however, have been reported from nearby areas, and they give an idea of what
could be present. Some, such as the Perdida site (Weir 1956), located in Starr County, are broad,
exposed lithic scatters with evidence for thousands of years of occupation and use. Paleo-Indian
period projectile point types included Plainview, Meserve, Angostura, Scottsbluff, and Clovis.
Hundreds of projectile points, however, dating to several different temporal periods, were
documented from the surface of the site, but subsurface investigations were not conducted;
subsurface extent to the deposits is unknown. Sites in Willacy County, to the southeast and
downstream of the project area, produced extinct tortoise shell fragments that were dated to 9,360
Â± 415 before present (B.P.) from an undisturbed context 70â80 cm below the surface (Bousman
et al. 1990), indicating the possibility of buried deposits dating to this era in the region. Isolated
Paleo-Indian projectile point discoveries have also been made in the region. Isolated finds, such
as these, could indicate use of the area by Paleo-Indian populations; however, such projectile
points may also have been curated items picked up by later prehistoric populations and deposited
far from their point of origin.

23

Archaic Period
The Paleo-Indian to Archaic transition is marked by a shift from an apparently greater emphasis
on a big-game hunting subsistence strategy to one stressing more generalized broad-spectrum
hunting and gathering (Black 1989). This subsistence modification was accompanied by gradual
changes in technology, settlement, and population, as well as being reflected by the division of
the long Archaic era into three sequential periods.

Early Archaic Period
The Early Archaic period (6000â2500 B.C.) has been suggested as representing a shift from a
highly nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle during the Paleo-Indian period to a slightly less
mobile, broader-spectrum subsistence strategy. A reduction in large game species caused by
depredation and/or environmental factors may have promoted use of a greater diversity of plant
and animal resources. Subsistence data that do exist for areas adjacent to the project region
indicate use of freshwater mussels, land snails, turtle, and freshwater drum (Scott and Fox 1982).
A technological shift from Paleo-Indian lanceolate points to Early Archaic stemmed dart points is
characteristic for the transition. Reasons for the change are not yet understood. Early Archaic
projectile point styles within the area, as described by Black (1989), include Andice, Bell, Early
Triangular, and early expanding stem forms such as Bandy, Martindale, Uvalde, and other similar
dart points. Also included in these assemblages are large triangular bifaces with concave bases,
Guadalupe bifacial tools, and Clear Fork unifacial tools (Black 1989:49).
As with the Paleo-Indian period, Early Archaic period archaeological data are lacking for the Rio
Grande valley. Extrapolations from inland and coastal areas to the north and northeast indicate
that groups during this time remained small and were highly mobile within relatively large
territories (Black 1989; McKinney 1981). Most sites are located on high terraces or upland
locations, though a few Early Archaic period components have been found deeply buried in
alluvial deposits well to the south and east of the project area (Scott and Fox 1982). Upland sites
frequently occur on exposures of Uvalde gravels, which consist of large quantities of knappable
chert. These gravels served as quarry locations throughout the Archaic and into the Late
Prehistoric eras. As a result, thousands of years of cultural use may be exposed on the surface at
one of these quarry sites.

Middle Archaic Period
Little evidence of Middle Archaic (2500â400 B.C.) assemblages exists within the Rio Grande
valley area. As with earlier periods, the data presented below are summarized from research in
adjacent areas in order to form a broad picture of cultural adaptations during this period.
As presently known for South Texas, the Middle Archaic period continues the shift to a greater
reliance on plant resources, based on the presence of dated burned rock middens that might be
related to those found in Central Texas (Hall et al. 1986). Open campsites, hearths, earth ovens,
and burned rock accumulations are found on floodplains, terraces, natural levees along present
24

Chapter 3: Cultural Context

and former stream channels, and in upland locales (Black 1989; Hester 2004). Late in the Middle
Archaic period, and continuing somewhat into the Late Archaic, cemeteries are found in parts of
South Texas (Hester 2004), though, again, none have been recorded in the project area. Upland
sites also frequently occur on exposures of Uvalde gravels, and assemblages may be mixed with
earlier and later quarry uses.
Middle Archaic period lithic technologies are identified relatively easily in the archaeological
record; triangular âstemlessâ dart points, particularly Tortugas and Abasolo, dominate among
lithic assemblages (Hester 2004:138). Other projectile point types and lithic tools that occur in
Middle Archaic contexts include Matamoros, Palmillas, Morhiss, and Bulverde dart points, and
unifacial and bifacial distally beveled tools that have been heavily reworked and resharpened.
Other artifacts appearing in the archaeological record from this period include incised bone,
tubular stone pipes, conch columella gouges, and conch adzes, though generally from sites farther
downstream (Black 1989).

Late Archaic Period
Late Archaic period sites (400 B.C.âA.D. 700) are more common within the Falcon Reservoir
area. Sites are generally characterized by dense accumulations of burned rock, hearths, and earth
ovens, and are frequently located adjacent to present stream channels. Lithic procurement sites
are often on high terrace exposures of gravels (Hester 2004). As with upland locations used
during earlier periods, assemblages may be mixed with both earlier and later quarry uses. While
cemetery sites continue to appear to the southeast of the project area (Hall 1981; Lukowski 1987),
isolated burials may also be found throughout the region (Hester 2004).
Corner-notched or side-notched projectile points, as well as smaller triangular styles, typify those
found in Late Archaic assemblages and include Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Fairland, Catan, Matamoros,
and Ellis dart points. Beveled tools are common, and corner-tang bifaces, while found, are more
rare (Black 1989). Ground stone artifacts are also frequently identified at these sites.
Subsistence data indicate use of a wide variety of animal and plant species, in addition to small
mammals (rabbits, rodents, etc.). Population densities were higher during this period than before
and may have been a continuation of population growth during the Middle Archaic (Black 1989).

Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800â1600) is probably the best understood of the prehistoric
sequence because the remains are more numerous and better preserved than those of previous
periods. Radiocarbon dates from this period are relatively more common, allowing for more
precise temporal control. In addition, the few ceramics that exist have aided in understanding the
Late Prehistoric period in South Texas.
Subsistence data from limited numbers of excavations as well as extrapolated information from
ethnohistorical documents suggest that the river played a strong role during the Late Prehistoric
period. Hunting, gathering plant resources, and fishing are all represented (Ricklis 2004). These
populations were likely semi-sedentary, establishing seasonal or temporary camps in places
where specific resources might be available.

HISTORIC CULTURAL SEQUENCE

Early Spanish Explorations and Perspectives on Indigenous Groups
Little is known about the indigenous groups residing in the region before the expansion of the
Spanish settlements in the mid 1700s. The earliest Spanish expeditions to examine the Rio
Grande occurred between 1519 and 1523 when the governor of Jamaica, Francisco Garay,
dispatched five expeditions to the Rio de Las Palmas, the former name for the Rio Grande
(Salinas 1990:22). The small fleet arriving in 1519 found more than 40 rancheros within six
leagues (ca. 25.6 km [16 mi]) of the mouth of the river. By 1520, Garay had dispatched 150 men
and seven horses under the direction of Don de Camargo to establish a colony; but this effort met
with fierce and bloody resistance. By 1523, Francisco Garay personally directed a contingent of
600 men and 150 horses in some 16 ships to the Rio Grande. He sent a party in small vessels to
scout some 15 leagues (64 km [40 miles]) upstream, and received a report that the region was
undesirable and uninhabited, although this is likely not the case. Garay then marched a force of
some 400 men south from the Rio Grande through marshes of the delta and met his ships in
Panuco. These early encounters convinced the Spanish that there was little to gain from settling
along the Rio Grande.
Krieger (2002) maintains that Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and three other shipwrecked
companions passed through the area between present-day Zapata and Roma in 1536 on their walk
from East Texas to the vicinity of El Paso, and then down the west of Mexico to Culican. Krieger
(2002:57) asserts that upon crossing the Rio Grande at Falcon Reservoir the group encountered a
village of 100 dwellings, and over the next few days they encountered two other comparable
villages. The Indian populations were much denser than anything these early explorers ever
encountered in East or South Texas. Precisely who these people were is not known. However,
based on the physical descriptions, they tended to live as hunter-gatherers and perhaps were
focused on the well-watered stream valleys.
A few decades later, a Dominican friar named Marcos Mena was the only person from a
shipwreck on Padre Island to survive the walk to Panuco across the Rio Grande (Salinas
1990:24). His 1554 report provides frustratingly little useful information about the region and the
indigenous people, and he was apparently the last Spaniard to traverse the region of the Rio
Grande delta for more than 100 years.
New explorations of the Rio Grande delta occurred in 1686â1688 when Alfonso de Leon led
three expeditions north in an attempt to find the French colony of Fort St. Louis (Salinas
1990:26). On the Rio Grande, these expeditions encountered many encampments of hostile
Indians who essentially followed a mobile hunting-gathering existence. Possibly the hostility
encountered by Leon stemmed from the general wariness that the indigenous peoples had toward
the Spanish because of their initial encounters with Francisco Garay or more recent treatment in
regions farther south.
The Spanish regarded the northeast frontier as âdespoblandoâ or unpopulated lands that were
occupied by nomadic but hostile hunting and gathering bands for the reasons outlined above.
Nevertheless, following the discovery of silver in Zacatecas in 1548, there was an expansion of
people from the Valley of Mexico toward the north. Slave raiding developed to provide labor to
26

Chapter 3: Cultural Context

work the mines in the Sierra Madre Oriental. By 1566, the town of Saltillo was founded in the
southern province of Coahuila. This community was later to become a main economic gateway
to the Spanish Missions that were established among the Caddo in northeast Texas after 1716 and
in San Antonio by 1718. Much of the drive to establish settlements in East and Central Texas
was aimed at preventing the French from laying claims to the region following La Salleâs brief
settlement of Fort St. Louis in 1685 in Matagorda Bay. However, the Camino Real (Kingâs
Highway) to these northern Spanish missions went from Saltillo, westward through Monclovia,
and across the Rio Grande north of present-day Laredo, and on to the missions of San Antonio.
South Texas remained largely untouched by Spanish influence and settlement until 1750 because
of the general lack of potable water between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River. Thus, the
indigenous people along the lower Rio Grande were relatively free of direct Spanish influence
below the Camino Real.
Nevertheless, some ethnologists have argued that the region of southeastern Texas and
northeastern New Mexico may have become a refuge area and melting pot of many diverse
Indian groups. Some were thought to be Indians from central and south Texas who fled south
ahead of the fierce Lipan Apache, and other groups who fled east to escape the Spanish slave
raiding activities along western Mexico. Still other native groups fled north from the push of
Spanish settlements in the Monterrey-Caderyeta-Cerralva region of eastern Mexico (Salinas
1990:4). One scholar goes so far to suggest that more than 200 different languages were spoken
in south Texas and suggests that perhaps the Native American sign language may have developed
in south Texas as a universal form of communication (Goddard 1979). Other scholars discount
such claims as nonsense. In refutation of such claims, sign language was found to have been in
use by Cabeza de Vaca in the lower Rio Grande by 1536, and apparently served as part of the
universal âtrade languageâ prior to the Spanish slave raiding activities of the west coast (Krieger
2002:123).
Many of these indigenous groups may have been decimated by impacts from European diseases
and later preyed upon by Lipan Apache who arrived in south Texas during the second decade of
the eighteenth century (Hester 2002a:150; Wade 1998). Archaeologists will probably long
ponder the evidence of regional population fluctuations during the earliest historic period.
Unfortunately, because the area was not along the major transportation corridor between Mexico
and the missions in San Antonio, few archival records are available on this topic.
In conjunction with the colonization of the Rio Grande, five missions were founded in towns
established in the mid-eighteenth century. These were the Mission of San Joaquin del Monte at
Reynosa (1750), Missions Divina Pastora de Santillana and San Aqustin de Laredo (both dating
to 1749) at Camargo, Mission Purisima Concepcion at Meir (1767), and Mission San Francisco
Solano de Ampuero at Revilla (1750; Salinas 1990:148â149). The records of births, marriages,
and deaths list the names of Indian affiliations at these missions, and these records document the
existence of no fewer than 39 named groups.
The meaning of some names is unclear, since they describe attributes of the people, their ethic
resemblance or affinity, or the names of general plants and animals. Salinas (1990:85, 91)
mentions that sometimes different names were applied to the same group (as when a single
appellation Pelones is ascribed to the Aquatinejos, Cacalotes, and Tortugas), and he has found
evidence that specifically named individuals from the Anda el Camino, Casa Chiquitas,
Mayapemes, Mulatos, and Saulapaguemes were identified in other documents as Borrados.
27

Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain how many distinct groups resided in the region during the
Spanish Colonial period. It seems likely that most of these indigenous people became integrated
into the Hispanic communities, and many of their descendents are presently regarded as part of
the Hispanic populations of South Texas.
In summary, the ethnographic record clearly indicates that there was a larger population of
indigenous people residing along the Rio Grande than in other areas of South Texas. The precise
names and number of groups residing along the river are uncertain, but most, if not all, were
nomadic or semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers. Some evidence suggests that this part of South Texas
became a refuge for many Indian groups during a relatively brief span from the late sixteenth into
the seventeenth centuries. Interestingly, for all the geographical diversity attributed to the
homelands of these exile people, the archaeological record shows relatively little in the way of
distinctive archaeological signatures for their existence in the region. Perhaps, like the horse
nomads in the Plains during the Protohistoric period (e.g. the Lipan and Mescalero Apache,
Comanche, Kiowa, etc.), distinctive sites are too ephemeral to identify without substantial study.

Historic Settlements
The lower Rio Grande was generally bypassed for settlement for two reasons. First, the
indigenous people were regarded as hostile and too nomadic to be worthy of colonizing. Second,
the area of South Texas between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River contained few watering
holes, so most excursions to East Texas simply avoided this area for several hundred years.
However, as Spanish population increased and Spanish control over the region became
established, these unsettled areas became the target for colonization as a means of stabilizing the
area.
The Spanish started colonizing the lower Rio Grande valley toward the middle of the eighteenth
century. In 1739, the King of Spain issued an order to colonize the lower Rio Grande (Fleming
1998:27â28), but it took seven years to work out the details. By 1746, Jose de EscandÃ³n was
appointed leader of the colonization movement, and he dispatched 765 soldiers to conduct a
reconnaissance of the region. From the maps and information returned from this expedition, he
developed a settlement plan for the colonies comprising the province of Nuevo Santander in
northeastern Mexico, which extended from the modern city of Tampico, Mexico, and as far north
as the Nueces River to San Antonio on the north. EscandÃ³n decided that 14 town sites would
provide the administrative and defensive needs for rural residents of Nuevo Santander, and the
Captain-General of each town could administer the military and civilian concerns without
establishing presidios (Fleming 1998:28). In order to reduce military costs to the crown, the King
decreed that civilians, rather than predominantly military or religious forces, would establish and
control the settlements.
Most of these civilians were stockmen from adjacent parts of Mexico. Their use as the primary
settlers of the region led to the development of a series of ranch-oriented communities. EscandÃ³n
immediately started laying out town sites, including five along the Rio Grande at intervals of 24
to 96 km (15 to 60 mi) apart. The series of communities founded along the Rio Grande is listed
in Table 4.

The religious colleges of north Mexico also established churches between 1749 and 1767 in four
of the Rio Grande towns: Reynosa, Carmargo, Mei,r and Reville. Of these, all are below the
present location of Falcon Reservoir, except Reville (Old Guerero) on the Mexican side within
the flood pool of Falcon Reservoir. By 1755, EscandÃ³n reported a population of 6,385 people in
the entire province of Nuevo Santander (Fleming 1998:30). Two years later the region had about
8,000 settlers. As incentives to participate in these settlements, EscandÃ³n offered the first
colonists farm, pasturelands, and money to acquire implements needed for settlement. By 1767,
land along the north side of the Rio Grande in the vicinity of the present Falcon Reservoir was
provided to colonists, and the parcels established on the Spanish concept of radial land grant
called PorciÃ³ns de la Jurisdicion de Guerrero. Each porciÃ³n measured about 1.2 to 2 km (0.75â
1.25 mi) wide by 15.2 to 20.8 km (9.5â13 mi) long. The Rio Grande defined the southwest end
of each porciÃ³n and differences in porciÃ³n lengths are mostly due to the meandering river, for the
original northeastern edge of these porciÃ³ns was developed from a straight baseline. This system
was ideally set up for ranchers and stockmen, since it guaranteed equal water access to a
maximum number of ranchers.
The original Spanish radial land grants in the vicinity of Falcon Reservoir numbered 36, assigned
to three jurisdictions of Meir, Revilla/Guerrero, and San Ygnacio. Thirty porciÃ³ns were assigned
in 1767: PorciÃ³n 3 from San Ygnacio jurisdiction, PorciÃ³ns 14â40 from the Revilla/Guerrero
29

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

jurisdiction, and PorciÃ³ns 55 and 56 from the Meir jurisdiction. Another five grants (PorciÃ³ns 1,
2, 4â6) in the San Ygnacio jurisdiction were made in 1784; and one grant (PorciÃ³n 41 in the
Revilla/Guerrero jurisdiction) was made in 1803 (McCullouch 2001:72â73). However, these 36
grants were assigned to people with only 18 different sir names. Sometimes, single individuals
received more than one porciÃ³n grant (cf., Juan Antonio Vidaurri, Joaquin Cuellar, etc.); in other
cases, multiple grants were given to people with a single sir name but different given names
(McCullouch 2001:72â73). Thus, for example, Santiago, Miguel, Bartolome, and Joaquin
Cuellar were able to secure six different porciÃ³ns as either adjacent properties or as closely
spaced noncontiguous properties. This suggests that extended families filed for colony land
grants to increase access to both lands and water. Quite possibly, these holdings were run as
family cooperatives, although further research is needed to verify this contention. Not all people
lived on their granted lands; some lived in towns, and others banded together on a few established
rancheros.
The settlements along the Rio Grande had relatively modest beginnings. In 1757, some 1,800
people and 200,000 head of livestock lived along the river south of Laredo. The specific
population of the five resident towns ranged from 637 people in Carmargo to 85 people in
Laredo; Revilla, in present-day Falcon Reservoir, had about 357 residents. By the end of the
eighteenth century, populations ranged from 1,174 in Camargo to 636 in Laredo, and Revilla had
1,191 people (Fleming 1998:30).
Attempts to impose the ranchero lifestyle in the Rio Grande region proved to be maladaptive in a
place frequently under attack by Lipan and Mescalero Apache, Comanche, and Kickapoo (George
1975:27). Additional upheaval was caused by bandits subsequent to the lawless days at the end
of Spainâs rule of Mexico during the decade of 1810. On March 29, 1813, Spanish units in Texas
were defeated, leading to the withdrawal of frontier protection. Without defensive military
presidios and the spread of missions, many of the initial ranch settlements on the porciÃ³ns proved
to be short-lived. This resulted in abandonment of many porciÃ³n grants, centralization of people,
and construction of defensive ranch complexes in those that remained viable in the region
(Fleming 1998; George 1975). Over the years, some people sold off segments of their holdings.
For example, the 1881 General Land Office map shows that many porciÃ³ns are intact, but
PorciÃ³ns 3, 40, 39, and 36 are subdivided into block-shaped lots, with only one lot having access
to the river; PorciÃ³n 29 has been subdivided lengthwise to preserve access to the river for its
owners. Modern maps display considerable variation in the lengths and widths of various
porciÃ³ns. In some cases the least productive lands, usually away from the river, was sold to
adjacent landowners (cf., PorciÃ³ns 15, 17, 18, etc.).
Changes are also evident in the nature of Spanish Colonial structures built on the porciÃ³ns.
Whereas the eighteenth-century government inspections conducted along the Rio Grande mention
the frequent use of adobe jacales, palisado, or adobe brick buildings, later structures were made of
masonry with gun ports and other defensive features (Fleming 1998; George 1975). Population
estimates of the region remained relatively low throughout most of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. Recent architecture trends often consist of buildings constructed of milled lumber
and/or concrete slab foundations with cinder block walls.
Previous archaeological surveys have recorded approximately 134 historic sites or features within
the boundaries of Falcon Reservoir on the United States side (McCulloch et al. 2003; Parsons
2004:Attachment 7.2; Perttula 2003). The CRMP list these as 20 locations with Spanish
30

Chapter 3: Cultural Context

Colonial/Spanish-Mexican/eighteenth-century/early nineteenth-century components; another 64
sites are merely listed as being historic, although their associated artifacts suggest some are
possibly Spanish Colonial and others are clearly twentieth-century sites. Fifty more sites are
listed as being late nineteenth-century or twentieth-century sites that are clearly post-SpanishColonial in affiliation and age. At least four âhistoric sitesâ are identified in the CRMP as such
based on chipped stone Guerrero points, which is a dubious basis for identification; these are not
included in the present total. Despite the ambiguities of classification, Perttulaâs (2003) count of
80 Spanish Colonial sites on the U.S. side of the reservoir is high according to the CRMP data
(Parsons 2004).
For a region stretching more than 56 km (35 mi) in length with 250 years of continuous historic
occupation, and with completion of a relatively intensive archaeological reconnaissance coverage,
documentation of less than 80 Spanish Colonial sites and 50 other sites with nineteenth- to
twentieth-century affiliations is not indicative of a very intensive settlement. This is especially
true based on the consideration that many of these sites are relatively recent in age.

31

CHAPTER 4
METHODS

The methods used in conducting the present project are provided in this chapter. The project
scope and the field strategy changed after one field session was completed due to alterations in
the USIBWC priorities. These changes necessitated development of other work plans that were
submitted and approved between late 2005 and mid-2006. The primary differences between the
work plans were twofold. First, the initial scope included a plan for feature identification,
assessment, and data recovery, whereas the final scope did not. Second, the survey parcels
differed between the initial and final work plans. In this chapter, the activities planned and
conducted regarding the feature identification, assessment, and data recovery plans are discussed
first, as this part of the project was later abandoned, followed by the plans and methods used for
survey. Background research conducted with regard to each of these activities is discussed as
appropriate in the discussions below.
Field work was conducted in three 10-day sessions: one in November 2005 and two in October
and November 2006. Dr. Chris Lintz and, later, also Mr. Sam McCulloch, served as Principal
Investigators. During the initial stages of the project, including the first field session and the
reworking of the scope of work in early 2006, Dr. Lintz served as PI and field director. Dr. Lintz
also contributed significantly to this report. Mr. McCulloch served as PI in 2006 during the last
two field sessions and report production. Mr. McCulloch provided valuable advice to the field
crew while at Falcon Reservoir and also edited and approved the report. In 2006, Christine G.
Ward acted as Project Archaeologist. Field crew over the three sessions consisted of Jim
Gillentine, Hedy Justus, Lynn Wack, and Glenn Wagner in 2005, and Matt Cuba, Faith Johnson,
Brett Lang, Jason Maywald, and Virginia Moore in 2006. Dr. David D. Kuehn provided
geoarchaeological insights during the 2005 session, and Shaun Phillips provided valuable GPS
and GIS expertise during the 2006 field sessions.

FEATURE IDENTIFICATION, EVALUATION, AND DATA RECOVERY
Part of the initial contract called for the data recovery of information from between 3 and 5
features from each of four unspecified archaeological sites in the reservoir (e.g., between 12 and
20 features total). The focus of the feature data recovery plan was to identify sites with integrity
and excavate the fragile features on sites in a manner that preserved the maximum amount of
33

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

scientific information. A wide range of features, ranging from complex historic rancheros to
simple prehistoric hearth sites, was expected to be encountered at Falcon Reservoir. While
common within the reservoir, human burials were not to be targeted for investigations. Due to
the uncertain nature of the kinds of features present, the initial plan was generalized with regard
to the specific types of features to be evaluated and the locations of sites with such features.
The contract called for the data recovery investigations of features on as many as four
archaeological sites. The contract did not specify which sites were to be studied, but preferred
features that would be relatively small, discrete hearths or other fragile features that would be
subject to damage from erosion, cattle grazing, and vandalism. The selection of sites with
features targeted for data recovery relied on data from the Falcon Reservoir CRMP (Parsons
2004), the Archaeological Sites Atlas maintained by the Texas Historical Commission, and a list
of important sites at Falcon Reservoir derived from a âSave Americaâs Treasuresâ (SAT) grant
proposal provided to GMI by the USIBWC. A search of these documents and files indicated that,
except for historic ranches, few archaeological sites have three to five features available for study.
Therefore, a list of potential target sites within one-half mile of the proposed CUA and NUA
survey parcels was generated. This compilation of 33 potential sites noted discrepancies in the
locations of archaeological sites between the two data sources for the same site number, possibly
due to encoding problems or with the North American Datum (NAD) corrections in the GPS
database. Furthermore, the Texas Sites Atlas has not yet integrated the site forms or information
from some of the more recent Parsons (2002, 2003) survey data (e.g., the NUA Zacatoso block);
therefore, some site data were not readily available.
The list of potential sites was compared against available site data provided in both Attachment
7.2 of the CRMP (Parsons 2004) and the data in the site lists of the SAT grant proposal.
Emphasis was placed on selecting sites from which the presence of features had previously been
reported. This process reduced the initial list to 12 sites containing features (Table 5; Figures 2
and 3); site documentation, however, indicated that no more than two hearths were present at any
single site. Indeed, few sites listed in the CRMP (Parsons 2004) report the occurrence of more
than two features. Five sites on the potential feature data recovery list are also on the SAT list
(41ZP745, 41ZP766, 41ZP786, 41ZP814 and 41ZP811). Insofar as the condition and nature of
features at these sites were unknown, the first work plan included an initial reconnaissance
investigation of sites with features during the first few days of the field season.
Half of these dozen sites (41ZP1, 41ZP808, 41ZP811, 41ZP814, 41ZP815, and 41ZP816) are in
or near the NUA area (see Figure 2). The other six sites occur in or near the CUA: 41ZP745,
41ZP766, 41ZP786, 41ZP693, 41ZP695, and 41ZP765 (see Figure 3). Six sites are listed in the
CRMP (Parsons 2004) as being potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP; five are designated
as having unknown eligibility; and one site, 41ZP185, a âlithic procurement locale with
concentrations of cobbles,â is regarded as being not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
These 12 sites initially selected for feature assessment, from which those for data recovery were
to be ultimately chosen, were visited by field crews during the first few days of the field session.
The initial fieldwork found eight of the targeted sites with features; others were under water and
thus inaccessible for investigation. At some of the relocated sites, more cultural features were
present than originally reported, but at others, the supposed features were actually natural
exposures of bedrock or mechanical pushpiles. Results of these feature assessments are discussed
with the appropriate site descriptions in Chapter 5.

Shovel testing at the assessed sites demonstrated that some features were completely destroyed
and had no remaining scientific value. Seventeen features were documented from the seven sites
(no feature forms were developed for natural bedrock exposures). Maps of features were drawn
and notes taken on the condition of the features. In addition, new site maps were drawn and site
forms were updated. Results from the survey were faxed to cultural resource managers at the
THC and USIBWC for review, with recommendations to salvage five prehistoric features at three
sites (41ZP786, F-2, F-3; 41ZP808, F-2, F-3, and 41ZP816, F-1), and test four architectural
features at the early historic ranch site, 41ZP1. Field site sketch maps and feature plan maps from
the 2005 field work are included with site forms for respective sites in Appendix 1 (Confidential
Appendices volume).
A conference call to resource managers at the USIBWC and THC during the initial field session
led to a revision of the initial work plan such that feature salvage would be postponed until GMI
crews completed all the surveys and presented another list of newly discovered features and
associated documentation so that all features could be included. Once it was decided that further
feature assessment, and of course data recovery, would wait until the completion of survey so
other sites might be included in the evaluation program, the focus of the remainder of the first
field session turned entirely toward completing survey of the initial parcels. The feature salvage
plan was tabled permanently between the 2005 and 2006 field sessions and substituted with
additional parcels for survey. All survey parcels are discussed in the following pages.

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

SURVEY LOCATIONS AND METHODS

Survey Parcel Selection
The initial contract stipulated that archaeologists survey 601 acres divided approximately evenly
between the CUA and NUA as defined in the Falcon Reservoir CRMP (Parsons 2004). Aside
from the stipulation that about half of the survey parcel acreages were to be split between the
CUA and NUA, there was little guidance on specific parcel areas to examine. Documentation in
the electronic files provided by the USIBWC indicated that no substantial block areas remained
unsurveyed in either the CUA or NUA. Small segments along shorelines, generally above the
areas subjected to reconnaissance survey by Parsons (2002; Parsons and LopezGarcia Group,
2004), remained.
GMI archaeologists selected the survey parcels based on the extent of the area available and ease
of access from roads (Figures 4 and 5). The NUA parcel included the upstream lands east of the
community of RamireÃ±o along Arroyo Burro and another parcel along the Rio Grande near the
Old San Ygnacio roadway. These parcels had not been previously surveyed and were accessible
by land. The CUA parcel was selected based on road access through the community of
Chihuahua, Texas, and focused on Arroyos Loma Blanca and CabeseÃ±a.
Several boundary constraints were encountered in calculating the acreage for the survey parcels.
Foremost was the fact that the modern topographic maps do not show the topography of the
reservoir areas below the 305-ft contour as these areas were largely submerged when map
revisions have been undertaken. Without such information, the survey parcel acreage was
difficult to determine. The 15-minute topographic maps prepared in 1927 provide some clues to
the landforms, but they were prepared at a relatively small scale and could not be electronically
rectified to reflect the modern reservoir configuration. The selection of survey parcels along the
upper reaches of arroyos provided a greater chance to have access to dry survey areas, but other
issues arise in determining the USIBWC ownership and lease limits in upslope areas. The
upslope boundaries of the proposed survey parcels coincide with the boundaries shown on an
electronic file depiction of the 307-ft traverse limits on the CD accompanying the Falcon
Reservoir CRMP (Parsons 2004). Those empirical boundaries provided a basis for calculating
survey acreage.
The United States Section of the IBWC manages the land up to the â307-foot traverseâ on the left
or north bank of the river, and retains flowage easements up to the 314-ft contour. The 307-ft
traverse represents the maximum extent of the 307-ft topography, meaning that any ridges that
drop below and then rise above the 307-foot contour to form island peninsulas are also managed
by the federal government. In order to simplify the land acquisition, the edges of the 307-ft
traverse were surveyed as a polygon slightly above the 307-ft contour, with turning points marked
with galvanized pipes and caps stamped with the survey markers. After 50 years, the lines of
sight between such markers are often overgrown; thus, the markers are often difficult to locate on
the ground.

Chapter 4: Methods

Four parcels comprising some 289 acres were selected for survey in the NUA (see Figure 4).
Three of these parcels encompass the upstream segments of IBWC property along Arroyo Burro
near the community of RamireÃ±o. These proposed survey parcels generally do not duplicate
areas covered by the Parsons and Wendy Lopez and Associates survey (Parsons 2002), and
complete the inventory of lands along that tributary. The last parcel is along the Rio Grande and
is located immediately north of and adjacent to the NUA Zacatoso block (Parsons 2004). The
survey limits extend from the edge of the IBWC property to the shoreline. Although the GIS data
provided on the CDs accompanying the CRMP do not show the 307-foot boundary, this survey
area limit was extrapolated from a model of topography obtained from the Texas Natural
Resource Information Service (TNRIS), which forms the basis for calculating the acreage to be
surveyed.
Two noncontiguous parcels, comprising some 316 acres, were initially selected for survey in the
CUA (see Figure 5). These encompass the lateral tributaries of Arroyo CabaseÃ±a and Arroyo
Loma Blanca. The upslope areas are defined by the 307-ft traverse/USIBWC property
boundaries as depicted on the CDs accompanying the Falcon Reservoir CRMP (Parsons 2004).
A very small part of the survey extends northeast of the limits of the CUA parcel and encroaches
on the parcel covered by McCulloch and others (2001). That survey found no sites on USIBWC
lands within Arroyo Loma Blanca and the present survey would ensure that all of the USIBWC
property along the arroyo was covered.
The field identification of project area boundaries was challenging as those were tied to
boundaries of lands under the jurisdiction of the USIBWC. During survey, crews found survey
caps marking boundaries at variance to the areas indicated on project maps developed from the
digital data files. As a result, in some cases, crews working from map data documented new
archaeological sites and later found boundary markers indicating the recorded site was not within
USIBWC jurisdiction. In other cases, it was not until data were processed and aerial photographs
of the region obtained that the project boundaries were definitely identified. Boundary
discrepancies such as these have the potential to add sites from private lands into the database of
resources that require USIBWC management. Sites erroneously recorded on private properties
are included in the following site descriptions, for work was conducted at them, but the
jurisdictional problems are made clear in the discussions.

Survey Methods
Prior to fieldwork, archaeologists reviewed archaeological site files and maps available on the
Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, as well as site descriptions provided in the CRMP (Parsons
2004). Copies of relevant reports (e.g., Karbula et al. 2006; McCulloch et al. 2003; Perttula et al.
1996) were also reviewed for site types likely to be encountered during survey and for
descriptions of sites previously recorded.
During the initial field session, each crew was equipped with recreational GarminÂ® Global
Positioning System (GPS) units for recording individual locations of shovel tests and artifacts;
however, given the difficulties encountered during that field session, in 2006, the previously
agreed-to project boundaries as well as locations of previously recorded sites received in digital
format from the USIBWC were loaded onto a TrimbleÂ® Geo-Explorer 3 GPS unit for reference
during survey. The TrimbleÂ® unit provided greater accuracy, and its mapping features provided
41

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

data needed in the field during survey. GPS data, during the 2006 field sessions, were collected
by a GPS/GIS specialist. In addition, site and project area definition data were also loaded onto a
laptop computer for use with a Geographic Information System (GIS, specifically ArcView 3.2),
such that data could be downloaded each evening and referenced for planning purposes. Each
dayâs dataâshovel test locations, boundary markers when encountered, and site features,
artifacts, and boundariesâwere analyzed in order to see the spatial arrangement of shovel tests,
the locations of sites in regard to previously recorded site locations, and to plan for the following
dayâs work. Aerial photographs and topographic maps were also included among the digital data
available for reference.
Four to six crewmembers conducted survey and shovel testing during the three 10-day field
sessions (November 2005, October 2006, and November 2006). Survey methods varied slightly
according to the assigned probability level (high, moderate, or low) of specific survey parcels to
contain intact, buried cultural deposits. In all areas, however, methods of systematic survey
coverage employed trained archaeologists walking transects that did not exceed 25-m intervals.
Following and defining the project boundaries on the ground was sometimes difficult in practice.
The USIBWC boundary markers were difficult to identify during survey due to overgrowth of
vegetation, thus complicating the matter of defining the outer limits of the project boundary.
Each of the survey areas presented a unique set of problems. In the CUA, for example, the
western and southern boundaries of the survey parcel were largely defined by the present
shoreline. As the shoreline in the CUA was the only good marker of the survey boundary,
pedestrian survey was conducted parallel to the water, regardless of direction, and this dictated
the manner in which each survey block was completed. In the NUA, multiple fencelines crossing
the survey parcels further convoluted the situation such that the project boundaries were often
difficult to identify. As a result, some documented sites were later found to extend beyond, or
even entirely outside, the USIBWC boundaries.
Shovel testing varied according to the projected probability of each area containing
archaeological sites. Systematic shovel testing was conducted in all high probability areas.
Judgmental shovel testing was conducted in other areas. Three distinct locational situations were
regarded as low probability areas for purposes of shovel testing. First, the wave-washed and
deflated zones with good surface visibility or in the modern flood channels of the arroyos were
regarded as low probability areas. The wave washed zones were not tested since prior experience
has shown that lithic debris is readily discernable in these shoreline-eroded areas. Second,
hillslopes and hilltops with strongly mottled sediments were regarded as having a low probability
of containing buried archaeological deposits, for these landforms represent unconsolidated
Eocene deposits. Third, recent/historic fill in channels and floodplain bottoms in major arroyos
that represent historic activities and lake flooding events were also not tested. Recent fill, as
found in these locations, is generally too thick for assessment using shovel-testing methods.
By contrast, shovel testing was conducted in areas of high probability and where dense vegetation
and/or sediment deposition obscured the original ground surface. High probability areas are
defined as terraces and hillslopes with Holocene alluvial and, particularly, aeolian deposits. In
high-probability areas, the density of shovel tests placed during the survey was one shovel test per
3 acres, in accordance with Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) survey standards.

42

Chapter 4: Methods

Shovel tests were excavated to sterile soil or bedrock, and fill from these holes was screened
through 0.25-inch hardware cloth. The discovery of flakes or other remains in a shovel test
warranted the placement of additional units within 5 m of the original hole to validate the
existence of a site rather than an isolated occurrence. The concentration of cultural debris within
a 10-m area or the recovery of cultural remains from adjacent shovel tests was sufficient to
designate the area as a site. Two shovel test forms were used during the present project. During
the 2005 session, an abbreviated form was used that frequently required additional documentation
in notes or in extra lines on the form. In 2006, these problems were alleviated by the
development of a form specific to the previously encountered situation at Falcon Reservoir. Both
forms are presented in Appendix A.
After a site was discovered, the crew systematically walked across the site in 5- to 10-m transects
searching for features and the limits of artifact distributions. Surface artifact distributions in
combination with the results of shovel testing were used to define site boundaries. Crew
members set a permanent datum (rebar with aluminum cap), drew a sketch map, completed a
paper copy of the State of Texas archaeological site form, shot representative digital photographs
of the site and its vicinity, and recorded the GPS position of the site datum, shovel tests, any
features, a representative sample of artifacts, and the perimeter of the site. Site datums were
stamped with the date, âGMIâ, and a site number, whether a trinomial (if the site was simply
being updated) or a temporary site number.
Features were plotted on the site sketch map, photographed, and described. Overall, little
emphasis was placed on collecting artifacts from the ground surface at sites. Formally made
diagnostic tools (e.g., projectile points and beveled knives) were collected from the site surfaces;
a select number of other bifaces and biface fragments was also collected. Most formal tools were
plotted on either the sketch map and/or GPS referenced. All cultural materials except firecracked rock recovered from shovel tests were collected.
Previously recorded sites, particularly in the CUA, had generally been initially documented
during reconnaissance survey (Parsons 2002, 2004), and thus site recording and boundary
delineation were preliminary and did not reflect what GMI archaeologists identified on the
ground in 2005 and 2006. Sites were often far larger than originally recorded and frequently had
far more in the way of surface identifiable artifacts and features than initially noted. This led to
substantial reworking of site documentation and considerable wrestling with boundaries
previously drawn between individual sites. In addition, several previously recorded sites were
not relocated. Pedestrian survey failed to note any surface evidence of some sites; consequently,
considerable effort was spent attempting to discern why cultural manifestations could not be
identified in particular areas (further discussed in Chapter 5).

ANALYSIS AND SITE DOCUMENTATION
All collected artifacts were subjected to analyses. Artifacts consisted entirely of chipped stone
tools from the site surfaces and debitage and other artifacts encountered in the subsurface deposits
of shovel tests. Analysis of each artifact consisted of a set of data, using a database developed by
GMI for standard use (see Appendix B for artifact attributes).

43

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Data analysis consisted primarily of downloading collected GPS data, integrating them with
previous site locational data, and delineating site boundaries. Site boundaries were based,
varying somewhat from site to site, on the surface distribution of artifacts and the location of
positive shovel tests. At many of the sites, recorded subsurface deposits were not present;
therefore, boundary delineations were based largely on the distribution of surface artifacts.
Delineation of site boundaries identified only, or primarily, through the presence of positive
shovel tests was more difficult. In these cases, there was a tendency for positive shovel tests to
follow the edge of the landform, thus making site delineation easier, particularly once aerial data
were combined with GPS data in the laboratory.
Paper copies of the State of Texas archaeological site form, filled out in the field, were updated in
the office to include new site boundaries as defined by GPS and aerial photographic data. Once
artifact analysis was completed, these data too were added to the forms prior to in-putting data
into the TexSite system of digital site forms. Printed copies of the site forms, for all 39 sites
recorded during the present project, are included in Appendix 1. Sketch maps of sites and
assessed features from the 2005 investigations are included with the site forms in the appendix.

CURATION
Notes, records, artifacts, and photographs have been prepared for curation according to the
standards of the repository. Upon completion of the project, these materials will be transferred to
the Center for Archaeological Research, University of Texas at San Antonio for permanent
curation and storage. This institution was selected due to its recognition as an approved curation
facility by the Texas Historical Commission and because of its spatial proximity to Falcon
Reservoir.

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

The evolving work plan for the present project ultimately led to survey of 601 acres, of which 385
acres are in the NUA and 216 acres in the CUA. Thirty-nine archaeological sites were recorded;
24 of these are in the NUA and 14 are in the CUA project areas. One site initially recorded was
later found to be just outside the NUA project area boundary and thus also outside those lands
under USIBWC jurisdiction. Some of the sites had been previously recorded, resulting in records
updates of those sites during the present effort, but 19 other sites were newly recorded during the
present survey.
In the NUA, seven previously recorded sites lay in the project area. Seventeen sites were newly
documented during the present survey. In the CUA, 37 previously recorded sites lay in the
project area; 11 could not be located. Twenty-two of the previously recorded sites were
combined during the present project into five larger sites. Seven sites whose boundaries were
adjusted remained relatively similar to their original recording by Parsons (2002). Two sites in
the CUA were newly recorded during the GMI survey.
The site descriptions that follow are compiled from the 2005 and 2006 documentation and are
separated in the following discussions by NUA or CUA. The majority of the work consisted of
pedestrian survey and shovel testing, and testing in order to define site boundaries, following
CTA survey standards. Assessment of feature integrity was begun as part of the initial phase of
the project, but was not completed when the project work plan was revised to exclude feature
testing in June 2006. As a result, the feature integrity assessments were abbreviated and do not
include the 12 to 20 features from four different sites as initially planned. Initial feature integrity
assessments, if conducted at a particular site, are incorporated into the appropriate site
descriptions. Work conducted in the two different field sessions (2005 and 2006) is also
differentiated in the following descriptions, as applicable. Following the site descriptions for
each section are abbreviated descriptions of randomly placed shovel tests that did not result in the
identification of cultural resources, and those that were aimed at locating previously recorded
sites without success (applicable only to the CUA) during the present effort.

NORTHERN UNSURVEYED AREA (NUA)
The project area within the NUA encompasses 385 acres along the northern and southern edges
of Arroyo Burro and several of its tributaries (Figure 6). A total of 25 archaeological sites was
located in this area, of which seven had been previously recorded and 18 were newly located and
recorded. The seven previously recorded sites were updated as part of the present project, though
three of these (41ZP1, 41ZP815, and 41ZP816) were visited primarily for assessing and
evaluating features for purposes of data recovery. Delineation of site boundaries for the other
four sites resulted in greatly expanded sites, and in one case (41ZP809) also resulted in the
definition of an additional temporal component. The prehistoric components at these sites are
composed of (1) presumed campsites located on terraces either of Arroyo Burro or its tributaries;
(2) chipped stone procurement sites located on hilltops and slopes with exposed lag gravel
deposits, and (3) sites with elements of both terrace and adjacent hillslope and hilltop use. Those
located on terraces or having elements on terraces frequently have buried cultural deposits. The
historic components consist of a cattle dipping vat and two residences.
A total of 188 shovel tests was excavated in the NUA survey area. All high-probability areas and
areas of moderate probability for having intact, buried cultural deposits were tested. Among
these shovel tests, 134 were located within the bounds of archaeological sites, and 10 of the 134
were originally excavated in high-probability areas in order to identify whether subsurface
deposits were present in the area. The remaining shovel tests served to check high- and
moderate-probability areas for the presence of buried cultural deposits. In the following
discussion, each updated or newly recorded site is discussed, followed by a summary discussion
of the nonsite shovel tests excavated in the NUA.

Updated Sites

Site 41ZP1

Previous Investigations
Site 41ZP1 was originally recorded by Jack Hughes (Kreiger and Hughes 1950) as part of
archaeological salvage work in the region prior to inundation by the reservoir. Site 75 D7 1, as it
was then designated, was described as having both âaboriginalâ and âcolonialâ period
components, and lay along the Rio Grande valley, had âmedium extent,â was of âaverageâ
concentration, and had potential for deeply buried deposits (Kreiger and Hughes 1950:39). The
recommendation for the site at that time was for thorough testing.
Kreiger and Hughes (1950) also reported that three or four rock house foundations were present,
and noted cultural materials included charcoal, bone, shell, pottery, glass, and chipped stone
debitage. Aboriginal stonework and Spanish pottery were collected from the site. Chipped stone
artifacts and charcoal were observed at depths of 10 ft in the alluvium.

Present Investigations
The site was visited and briefly characterized by GMI archaeologists in 2005 as part of the feature
evaluation part of the project, later abandoned. Four features were recorded at the site (Figure 7;
also, see sketch maps accompanying site forms in Appendix 1): the main structure (Feature 1), an
extensive midden (F. 2), a rock wall remnant (F. 3), and a small structure (F. 4). The features are
all on a T1 terrace of the Rio Grande, just below a 3-m high T2 silt terrace.
Feature 1 consists of a rectangular pattern of large (40â60 cm) sandstone slabs lying flat, one
course high. Some rocks are presumed buried, as there are irregular gaps between some of the
slabs. This foundation measures approximately 5-x-6 m and is within an area of dense vegetation
at the southeast side of the site. Shovel Test 2 was placed near the feature and was excavated to a
20-cm depth, at which point the test was terminated due to an extremely dense deposit of chipped
stone artifacts. These artifacts are composed of six core reduction flakes, three biface thinning
flakes, 10 indeterminate flake fragments, and a single piece of shatter. At least five of these
artifacts have evidence of heat-treating; all the artifacts are of chert, of varying qualities and
textures.
Feature 2, the midden, is along both sides of an old road that runs northwest-southeast through the
site. It measures 20-x-60 m in extent and is an average of 30 cm high. Contents in the midden
include particularly chipped stone debitage, earthenware ceramics with green or brown glaze,
brownware ceramics, and whiteware sherds with blue annular and blue paint. All artifact types
mentioned are abundant in the midden area. Shovel Test 1 was placed near the southeast end of
the midden. It was excavated to a 70-cm depth, at which point sterile silt deposits were
encountered. Nine chipped stone artifacts were collected from this test, all from the top 20 cm;
four are biface thinning flakes, two are core reduction flakes, and three are indeterminate flake
fragments.
Feature 3 is a 1.5-m-long wall remnant consisting of two vertically set rocks. Each stands about 1
m in height. The feature is interpreted as possibly the corner of a structure. It is southeast of the
midden (see Figure 7).
Feature 4, to the northeast of F. 3, is the foundation of another smaller structure. Flat slabs define
a 2-x-2-m enclosure.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP1 seems to be much as Kreiger and Hughes (1950:39) described it. The 2005 GMI
investigations, though limited in scope, recorded four features on the site, three of which are
likely structural remains. The fourth feature is an extensive midden with both prehistoric and
historic materials in abundance. Minimal testing demonstrated substantial subsurface deposits
that, according to Kreiger and Hughes (1950), may be as deep as 3 m. This site is recommended
as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. Further testing of the four recorded
features, as well as a controlled collection of a sample of artifacts from Feature 2, the midden, are
recommended for evaluation purposes. Research of archival documents should also be conducted
to determine the importance of this site and whether it can contribute data important to an
understanding of historic settlement of the region.

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Site 41ZP807

Previous Investigations
This site was originally recorded as part of a pedestrian reconnaissance survey of selected areas in
the NUA (Parsons 2002). Site 41ZP807 was at that time described as a primary lithic materials
procurement site located on a dissected upland slope (Parsons 2002:166). It was mapped as
having a surface area of 2,400 m2 and being 30-x-80 m in size.
Primary lithic debitage, tested cobbles, and expended cores atop a Uvalde lag gravel surface were
described as being present along the slope defining the site area. The site form, however,
additionally mentions collected artifacts as consisting of a preform, a preform fragment, a
projectile point, and the proximal end of a biface. The south boundary of the site was defined as
being the bulldozed road and adjacent fence line, which also defined the project boundary.
Disturbances such as a then-recently bulldozed field road, shoreline erosion, and slope erosion
were all noted, and the site was described as being 50 percent intact. The site at that time was
assigned a low research potential.

Present Investigations
The site is located along a high slope and ridge with drainages leading into Arroyo Burro located
to the east and north (see Figure 6). It lies on the low terraces of these drainages and the adjacent
slopes to the west and south that lead upward to a high hill/ridge outside the project boundary.
Vegetation on the north terrace consists of a dense stand of prickly pear and, on the adjacent
slope, combined prickly pear, some grasses, and mesquite. The terrace along the east edge is less
well defined and is covered with a dense growth of mesquite and underbrush. The site has now
been redefined as a lithic procurement site and probable open camp. Its size has also been
revised, measuring 359 m parallel to the side drainage and 345 m parallel to Arroyo Burro,
totaling an area of 74,131 m2.
The site as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2006 apparently lies in part outside properties
under USIBWC jurisdiction (Figure 8). Property markers were not well defined in this
immediate area, and it was not until data were processed that GMI was made aware of this site
being partly investigated outside the project boundary.
In 2005, GMI archaeologists defined a site area (GMI temporary site # L7; see sketch map
accompanying site form in Appendix 1) to the south of the known location of 41ZP807 along the
eastern tributary drainage. In 2006, GMI archaeologists connected L7 with the originally defined
41ZP807 through observations made during pedestrian survey (see Figure 8). The cultural
deposits previously defined as two site areas are in fact continuous and extend far outside the
project boundary along the eastern and northern slopes of the adjacent hillside. As a result, the
previously known boundary of 41ZP807 has been greatly expanded, now encompassing an area
of at least 18 acres and covering both terraces and the adjacent hillslopes that fill the area
southwest of the junction of the eastern and northern tributary drainages.

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Seven archaeologists walked the distance between the previously recorded 41ZP807 and the
small site recorded to the south at 5-m intervals and noted a continuous scatter of chipped stone
cores, tested cobbles, debitage, and tools between the two locations. Although the western
project boundary prohibited close inspection of the ground surface along the hillslope in that
direction, there was every indication that the artifacts continue farther upslope. Shovel testing
was conducted close to the two drainages, at the southeast edge of the site where site L7 was
previously defined, and along the northern edge in the vicinity and to the west of the previouslyrecorded boundary of 41ZP807.

Surface Investigations
Thousands of chipped stone artifacts were noted on the site surface, and likely hundreds of these
artifacts are bifaces in various stages of production. The density of cultural materials, including
cores, tested cobbles, tools, and debitage, is approximately 25 chipped stone artifacts per square
meter, particularly on the lower hillslopes; the density on the two terraces is lower, in the range of
approximately 15 artifacts per square meter in the densest of areas. Very few of the artifacts were
individually mapped and described due to the density of cultural materials. Artifacts collected
from the site surface include bifacially modified tools in various stages of production and
modification, and projectile points. A total of 12 artifacts was collected from the site surface.
These tools, as well as all noted debitage, cores, and tested cobbles, are of chert, which is readily
available among the plentiful lag gravels strewn across the slopes and terraces in the site vicinity.
Brief descriptions of the collected surface artifacts are provided in Table 6 and a sample of these
artifacts is shown in Figure 9.

Most of the formal tools observed across the surface of the site were found along the lower
hillslopes, rather than on the terraces. All stages of biface production are represented among
these artifacts; as with the representative sample collected from the ground surface, production
Stages 2â5 as well as finished, primarily triangular, dart points are all present. Almost all of the
artifacts noted are of chert, with a notable exception of a single biface fragment made from an
unknown igneous material.
53

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Other artifacts noted on the surface of this site include bifacial drills, cores, bifacially modified
choppers, modified debitage, distal fragments of thin bifaces, and thin bifaces with serrated and
beveled edges. All these artifacts as well were made from chert, and several show evidence of
heat-treating.

Subsurface Testing
Shovel tests were conducted in 2005 (at site L7) and in 2006 near the previously noted boundary
of 41ZP807 at the north end of the site. In both areas, some depth to the sediments was noted
along or close to the tributary drainage, where the ground surface is far more level. A total of 13
shovel tests was excavated in these two parts of the site (Table 7; see Figure 8). Along the
sloping hill surface, the sediments were very shallow overlying bedrock and weathered bedrock.
The area between the northern and southern concentrations then, was not shovel tested due to the
widespread exposure of bedrock across much of the surface, and the ensuing very low probability
of intact subsurface deposits.

Shovel Tests L-1 through L-6 were excavated at the southern end of the site, near the
southernmost concentration of artifacts originally labeled as Site L7 (see Table 7). Four of these
tests were terminated due to thick lenses of gravels at depths less than 40 cm below the modern
ground surface. The other two tests, L-2 and L-4, were excavated to 80 and 100 cm below
surface, respectively. Artifacts were recovered from these six shovel tests, between the ground
surface and 60-cm depth.
From Shovel Test L-2, two chipped stone tools and four pieces of chipped stone debitage were
recovered from between 0â60 cm depth. An early-stage biface with just one flake removed from
one face of the tool was identified, as was a flake modified to create an end scraper. Two biface
thinning flakes and one indeterminate flake fragment were also recovered from Level 1. All
recovered lithic artifacts were made of various types and qualities of chert. A single chert flake
fragment was also recovered from Level 3 (40â60 cm depth) in this same shovel test.

55

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Five flaked stone artifacts were identified from 20â30 cm depth in Shovel Test L-5. These
consist of a piece of debitage modified to create an end scraper, two core reduction flakes, an
indeterminate flake fragment, and a piece of shatter. The modified debitage piece is a large split
cobble fragment whose fragmented end was modified by removal of a series of small flakes along
the very steep edge. These five artifacts are all of chert, in a variety of colors and textures. Only
the piece of shatter shows discoloration from heat-treating.
Shovel Tests BL-16 and -17, and MC-11, -12, -13, and -14 -were excavated in the vicinity of the
originally defined boundary of 41ZP807. These tests also indicated relatively shallow subsurface
cultural deposits. Flaked lithic artifacts were recovered between the ground surface and 20-cm
depth in Shovel Tests BL-17 and MC-11. A single indeterminate flake fragment and a single
core reduction flake were recovered from the top 20 cm in each of Shovel Tests MC11 and BL17,
respectively. All the chipped stone artifacts are of chert, and only the flake fragment has
indications of heat-treating.

Site Summary and Recommendations
The surface assemblage at this site is large and diverse, consisting of the full range of
manufacturing debris. Core reduction activities, in association with the large gravel exposure on
the hill to the south, and biface and other tool production representing the full range of
manufacturing activities are present. Fire-cracked sandstone fragments and chipped stone debris
were both found in shallow, but seemingly intact, subsurface deposits along the terraces to the
east and south. There is a good potential for buried features along these lower landforms. Given
the large and diverse array of chipped stone manufacturing activities in the surface assemblage
and the possibility for buried features along the lower parts of the landform, 41ZP807 is
recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. It is recommended that
additional test excavations are necessary for determining the data potential of site 41ZP807.

Site 41ZP808

Previous Investigations
This site was originally recorded as a thin lithic scatter with associated burned rock features in
2001 as part of a pedestrian reconnaissance survey of selected areas in the NUA (Parsons 2002).
Site 41ZP808 is located on the toe of a sloping ridge (Parsons 2002:167; see Figure 6). This toe,
which they suggested may be a T3 remnant, faces north to northwest and is bounded in that
direction by the dense vegetation growth alongside Arroyo Burro and to the south by the fairly
steep slope of the ridge. It was mapped as having a surface area of 6,650 m2 and being 95-x-70 m
in size.
Two burned rock features were noted in proximity to one another on the toe slope; these features
measure 0.83 m and 1.60 m in maximum diameter (Parsons 2002:167, Figure 4.1.120). They
were accompanied by a thin scatter of primary and secondary debitage that was noted extending
down the Uvalde gravel-covered slope of the ridge. Among the scatter were a single bifacially
flaked cobble and a distal point fragment. No artifacts were collected from the site. Impacts to
56

Chapter 5: Survey Results

the site at that time included slope erosion, shoreline erosion, wild animal burrowing and pathbreaking, and use of a then-recently bulldozed road along the southeast edge of the site
approximately two-thirds of the way up the adjacent ridge. The site was assigned good research
potential and defined as being approximately 75 percent intact.

Present Investigations
The site was rerecorded in 2005 by archaeologists from GMI, and shovel tests were excavated
near the features as part of the initially conducted feature identification and evaluation plan. The
site is on the relatively flat hardpan surface at the base of a north-facing slope. This location is
slightly north of the previously plotted location, which would be predominantly on the gravel
slope. Upslope of the GMI-plotted location is a Pleistocene terrace with abundant gravels strewn,
presumably, across the top and certainly down the slope. Vegetation on the terrace consists of
scattered mesquite and huisache and a dense stand of prickly pear. Vegetation along the slope is
sparse, consisting only of some scattered grasses and prickly pear.
The siteâs size and orientation also differ somewhat from that previously documented. The site
area measures 45-x-60 m (2,700 m2) and is oriented from southwest to northeast.

Surface Investigations
Four burned rock hearths were located on the hardpan terrace surface (Figure 10; see site and
feature sketch maps accompanying site form in Appendix 1). Numerous secondary and tertiary
flakes, tested cobbles and cores, and six bifacially flaked chipped stone tools were noted across
the siteâs surface. The four features are located within a 30-x-40-m core area, with the surface
distribution of artifacts delineating the extent of the site. No artifacts were collected from the
surface of the site, as no diagnostics were identified.

Subsurface Investigations
Feature 1 is a dispersed scatter of fire-cracked rock (Figure 11). It measures 4.0 m east-west by
2.0 m north-south. At its eastern edge is a 1.0-x-1.0-m concentration of chipped stone debris
consisting of a dozen or so chert flakes and angular debris. The feature itself consists of
sandstone (14) and burned sandstone rocks (10), cobbles and gravels (14), with six chipped stone
artifacts scattered among and between the other stones. Shovel Test W-3 was excavated adjacent
to the feature, but no artifacts were recovered from it (Table 8). The sediments consisted of
sandy loam (20 cm thick) overlying sterile, mottled clay loam sediments that extended to at least
60 cm below surface. No diagnostic artifacts were found in association with this feature. In spite
of its dispersion and the adjacent, negative shovel test, the feature itself is thought to have
relatively good integrity.

Feature 2, located east of Feature 1 (Figure 12; see Figure 10), consists of a relatively dispersed
scatter of burned sandstone rocks (5), and cobbles and gravels (17) across a 1.0-m east-west by
1.3-m north-south area. A chert chipped stone flake was present on the modern ground surface at
the south edge of this scatter and a chert chipped stone biface was found 40 cm north of the
scatter. Four of the burned sandstone fragments were grouped together along with several
cobbles, but the other stones were more scattered across the area. Shovel Test W-2 was
excavated near this grouping of rocks to 50-cm depth below modern ground surface; the
stratigraphy consisted of two layers (see Table 8). Two secondary chipped stone flakes were
recovered from the top stratum, which extended from the modern ground surface to 27-cm depth.
The integrity of this feature, based on surface and subsurface observations, was determined to be
good.

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Feature 3 is southeast of Feature 2 and consists of an 80-x-80-cm scatter of burned sandstone
fragments. Seven of these pieces are still embedded in the surrounding matrix. No artifacts were
noted on the ground surface in its immediate vicinity. Shovel Test W-4 was excavated northeast
of the feature. A single chipped stone flake was recovered from the top 20 cm of the shovel test.
The feature was determined to be eroded and to retain little integrity.
Feature 4 is located south of Feature 3 and consists of a 1.8-x-1.4-m scatter of fire-cracked rock
within a larger cluster of chipped stone debitage. Sixteen fragments of burned sandstone are
scattered across this area; five appear to be embedded within the hardpan surface. The remainder,
along with 20 pieces of chipped stone debitage and a single projectile point fragment, lay upon
the hardpan surface. Shovel Test W-1 was excavated approximately 60 cm northeast of the edge
of the fire-cracked rock scatter, and excavation revealed three strata (see Table 8). Three chipped
stone flakes and a single piece of fire-cracked rock were noted from the top stratum, from 0â20
cm in depth. There was no surface or subsurface staining of the sediment in the vicinity of the
burned rock, and the feature was determined to be eroded and to retain little integrity.

Site Summary and Recommendations
The surface assemblage at this site is small and dispersed, with formal tools represented, though
no temporally diagnostic items among them. Four fire-cracked rock features are also on the
surface, and testing adjacent to each suggested that two (Feature 1 and Feature 2) may retain
some integrity. The surface assemblage is limited and datable artifacts are lacking, but the
shallow alluvium of this terrace does appear to retain the possibility for buried features. The
eligibility of 41ZP808 for inclusion in the NRHP is recommended as unknown at this time. It is
recommended that additional test excavations are necessary for determining the data potential of
site 41ZP808.

Site 41ZP809

Previous Investigations
Site 41ZP809 was originally recorded as a historic period livestock dipping vat in 2001 as part of
a pedestrian reconnaissance survey of selected areas in the NUA (Parsons 2002). It is located on
a narrow, low sandy ridge, just south of Arroyo Burro (see Figure 6).
The mapped site included the vat, a concrete apron around the vat, and a series of eight fence
posts surrounding the vat itself. The dip vat (described in more detail below) had stairs leading
into it from the southwest and a ramp at the northeast. It was constructed entirely of poured
concrete. No inscriptions were noted in the poured concrete, and no associated artifacts were
noted in the area. Impacts to the site were at that time described as only those associated with the
dense growth of vegetation on the sandy rise and inundation from the reservoir. Although the vat
itself was described as being almost 100 percent intact, it was assigned a low research potential
due to its isolated nature.

61

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Present Investigations
The site was rerecorded in 2006 by archaeologists from GMI. On pedestrian survey through the
area, the sandy ridge was noted and shovel-tested as a high priority area (see Figure 6), regardless
of proximity to a known historic site. The low-lying sandy ridge is very close to Arroyo Burro,
and thus no gravels were noted on the modern ground surface; upon close inspection, however,
chipped stone debitage was noted on the modern ground surface. Vegetation on the ridge consists
of relatively dense mesquite and prickly pear.
In addition to documenting the historic dipping vat and associated features, seven shovel tests
were excavated along the ridge to test for the subsurface extent of the prehistoric component
(Figure 13). In the following discussion, investigations of the surface aspects of both the historic
and prehistoric components are discussed first, followed by the discussion of the subsurface
prehistoric component; the historic component was found to not have an associated subsurface
extent.

Surface Investigations

Historic Dipping Vat
As noted during the earlier survey (Parsons 2002), the dipping vat consists of a poured concrete
vat with a concrete apron extending from the southwest end (Figure 14). There are the lower
parts of four fence posts placed close to the vat along each side. The vat has a sloped edge at the
northeastern end and a series of small steps leading from the vat to the apron at the southwest
end. A smaller concrete apron extends from the northeast end of the vat.
The whole of the concrete feature measures 15.8 m (51.8 ft) in length, extending southeastnorthwest, and ranges in width from 0.9 to 3.0 m (2.95 to 9.8 ft). The interior part, consisting of
the dip vat itself, measures 9.0 m (29.5 ft) in length and is 1.0 m (3.3 ft) in width. The poured
concrete lip is 17 cm thick along the long axis of the vat. This interior part of the vat rises 28 cm
(0.9 ft) above the modern ground surface and has a total depth of 1.4 m to the deepest part of the
vat. The flat bottom of the vat, not including the steps at the south end, is 4.9 m (16.1 ft). The
wall at the northeast end of the vat is vertical, rising from the bottom of the vat for 63 cm, then
sloped for the remainder of the vatâs height. The length (from south to north) of the slope is
79 cm. At the southeast end, a series of 16 steps of approximately even size, 15-cm rise by 15-cm
run, lead out of the vat onto the larger apron. The horizontal distance covered by these steps is
3.25 m. This southern apron expands from the vat to a width of 3.0 m (9.8 ft) and extends for a
distance of 5.6 m (18.4 ft). Atop the eastern lip of the vat, at a point 4.40 m from the southern
edge of the interior part of the vat, the initials âJ.S.â are engraved into the concrete.
At the far southeast edge of this poured concrete apron are five flagstones, creating a step from
the concrete onto the surrounding sandy sediment (see Figure 14). These five flagstones range in
size from 15-x-20 cm to 42-x-20 cm; four are at the east edge, and the fifth is distanced from the
remainder toward the west edge. The gap between these stones was likely filled at one time with
other flagstones. The GMI crew attempted to determine if other flagstones were present in this
gap by probing, but no others were identified.

Dipping vat at 41ZP809, showing the vat, concrete aprons, and flagstones

Figure 14. Dipping vat at 41ZP809, showing the vat, concrete aprons, and flagstones.

Along the length of the interior part of the vat, embedded in the ground surface along each edge,
are four fence posts, approximately paired at uneven intervals (see Figure 14). The first pair, at
the northern end, is at the point where the vat meets the smaller concrete apron, and the last pair
is 6.0 m (19.7 ft) from the northern end. As suggested in Parsons (2002), these fence posts are
the likely remains of a fence enclosure or loading chute.
In addition to these previously noted site features, there are also 14 fence posts leading from the
northeast in an almost direct southwesterly line toward the dipping vat (see Figure 14).. The
nearest one to the dipping vat is 40.7 m distant, and thus an association between the two is
suggested by the direct line, but not definite. From the first to the fourteenth posts is a distance of
96.25 m; and 14 m past the fence posts is the low-lying drainage within Arroyo Burro. Beyond
the one closest to the vat, these posts are spaced at distances ranging from 1â24 m. The fence
posts are all in poor, deteriorated condition and range in height from 0.84 m (2.8 ft) to 1.23 m
(4.0 ft). No wire or fencing was noted in association with any of the posts, though remnant
64

Chapter 5: Survey Results

fencing staples are still visible in several. Two additional wood fragments were found lying flat
on the ground in the general vicinity of this line of posts and are presumed to be the remnants of
other posts, broken off and fallen to the side of this line.
A single historic (or recent) artifact was noted on the surface of the site, with a possible
association to the cattle dipping activities. A jar, with the mark of the Hazel-Atlas Glass
Company (Toulouse 1971:239), was found on the modern ground surface approximately 12 m to
the north-northwest of the dip vat. The particular mark on the glass dates from 1920â1964. No
other historic or recent artifacts of possible association with the dip vat were noted in the site
vicinity.

Prehistoric Chipped Stone Debris
About 20 pieces of chipped stone debitage were noted on the ground surface of the low-lying
sandy ridge. These were widely scattered across an area extending approximately 95 m from
southwest to northeast along the top of the ridge by 51 m southeast to northwest across the ridge.
No fire-cracked rock was noted, and no chert gravels, tested cobbles, or cores were among the
artifacts. As they were relatively widely scattered, no pattern could be discerned in the
distribution of the artifacts, and no concentrations were noted. None of the surface chipped stone
artifacts at the site were collected, as no formal tools were identified.

Subsurface Testing
Seven shovel tests were excavated along the top and sides of this low-lying sandy ridge in order
to define a subsurface extent to the historic and prehistoric deposits (Table 9; see Figure 13).
Shovel Tests MC8 and BL10 were excavated along survey transects because the sandy ridge was
determined to be an area having a high probability for subsurface cultural deposits. As chipped
stone debitage was recovered from Shovel Test BL10 and fire-cracked sandstone fragments were
noted in Shovel Test MC8, four additional shovel tests were excavated to test for the extent and
nature of these prehistoric cultural deposits. Two of these additional tests, MC35 and BL33, were
also positive for subsurface cultural deposits. Two other tests, MC36 and VM2, were placed in
areas ultimately determined to be outside the site boundary.
In total, three core reduction flakes, a piece of shatter, and a single indeterminate flake fragment
were collected from Shovel Tests BL10, MC35, and BL33 from depths of 20â90 cm below the
modern ground surface. Fire-cracked rock fragments were noted from MC8 and MC35, from
depths of 40â60 cm below the modern ground surface.
As the sandy ridge extends a little farther to the east than the extent of the site, shovel testing was
conducted during transect survey in order to further test the ridge for the extent of 41ZP809, as
well as its possible connection with 41ZP808, located just 120 m to the southeast. These tests
(VM2 and MC6), categorized as nonsite tests in high-probability areas (see discussion of NUA
Nonsite Shovel Tests), were negative for subsurface deposits and thus the boundaries of the two
sites were established.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP809 is a multicomponent site with a cattle dipping vat and an undetermined prehistoric
component. The dipping vat is in good condition and accompanied by several other features of
note (i.e., fence line leading to it, flagstones, initials engraved in the poured concrete). By itself,
however, and without reference to a larger ranch complex, this feature can add little to our
understanding of the ranching economy prior to construction of the dam and reservoir. Archival
research on the ranching history of the area is recommended before an eligibility recommendation
regarding this component of the site can be made. The previously unrecognized prehistoric
66

Chapter 5: Survey Results

component is represented on the surface by a limited assemblage of chipped stone debitage. Firecracked rock fragments noted in shovel tests indicate the potential for buried features. The
surface assemblage is limited and datable artifacts are lacking, but this potential for buried
features along this sandy ridge does suggest that this site may retain integrity and might
contribute data for an understanding of the prehistoric use of the region. The integrity of these
subsurface deposits should be further tested to determine the eligibility of the largely subsurface,
prehistoric component for the NRHP. However, the potential for hazardous chemical residues
resulting from the dipping activities should be evaluated prior to any subsurface investigations.
Site 41ZP809 is therefore recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP811

Previous Investigations
41ZP811 was originally recorded as part of a reconnaissance survey of large parts of the CUA
and NUA regions (Parsons 2002). It was defined as a thin, multicomponent lithic scatter with
numerous burned rock features located on a low, narrow sandy finger ridge at, or overlooking, the
juncture of a tributary to the west and Arroyo Burro to the south (see Figure 6). The site was
measured as 190 m north south by 40 m east west, with an area of approximately 7,600 m2.
Surface visibility, estimated at 95 percent, was obscured only by dense mesquite and prickly pear
on top the ridge, and scattered prickly pear and grasses on the eroded slopes.
Burned rock and lithic debris were eroding along the east and west edges of the finger ridge and
were assumed to extend across the landform, though the top was not checked as it was outside the
project boundary. Twelve large, dispersed scatters of burned rock were noted along the west
edge of the slope; these were defined as two hearths, two concentrations, and eight more
dispersed and eroded scatters. Primary and secondary chipped stone debitage and tested cobbles
and cores were found across the site area. A single Tortugas point base and one Pandora-like
point base were collected. Impacts were described as minimal, consisting only of the slope
erosion, and the site was estimated to be 90 percent intact. With good potential for buried
deposits, a diversity of artifact types, including diagnostic forms, and a large number of firecracked rock features, the site was assigned good research potential.

Present Investigations
The site was rerecorded by GMI archaeologists during the 2005 and 2006 field sessions (see site
and feature sketch maps accompanying site form in Appendix 1). In 2005, it was initially
targeted for assessment because of the large number of burned rock features originally recorded
as eroding from the edges of the finger ridge. The site is located on an eroded and disturbed
hillslope and along the eastern and western slopes and terraces below the hill. The hilltop has an
extensive lag gravel deposit, and the terraces are composed of sandy clay loam sediments.
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2006, apparently lies in part outside properties
under the jurisdiction of the USIBWC. Property markers were not found in this immediate area,
and it was not until data were processed in the lab that GMI was made aware of this site being
partly investigated outside the project boundary.
67

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Surface Investigations
Upon inspection of the hill and eroded edges to the east, west, and south, a single burned rock
feature and a scatter of chipped stone debris were identified as comprising site 41ZP811 (Figure
15). Previously mapped locations of features and burned rock scatters were checked thoroughly,
but no others features or concentrations were identified. Instead, eroding bedrock was identified
in these locations, and these exposures were presumed to be what were previously identified as
features.
In spite of a lack of identified features, the site boundary was greatly expanded from those
defined during the Parsons (2002) survey. It was defined as having a maximum north-south
extent of 197 m and a maximum east-west extent of 250 m, with a total site area of 33,027 m2.
The site extends across the hill top and along the eastern, western, and southern hillslopes, as
previously identified, but also encompasses the very large interconnected terraces to the south and
west of the hill. Few artifacts are visible on the lower slopes on the east edge of the hill, and the
relatively level ground below the hill between this knoll and the next elevated landform to the
east does not have artifacts scattered across its surface. This area was not investigated further as
the cultural materials appeared to be scattered to the west.
Abundant chipped stone debris was identified among the lag gravels on the hill and its lower
slopes, while a more sparse artifact scatter was identified on the alluvial terrace deposit. These
surface artifacts consist of tested cobbles, cores, and primary and secondary lithic debitage. The
densest deposits, on the hillslopes, consist of up to 15 flakes per m2, though most areas have
debitage at a far lower density of a flake every 2 m2. No diagnostic artifacts or formal tools of
any sort were noted on the modern ground surface of the site.
Subsurface Investigations
The single burned rock feature (designated F. 1) was identified, located on the terrace between
the hillslope and the tributary drainage along the west site edge. This feature was mapped,
drawn, and photographed, and Shovel Test 1 was excavated nearby to investigate whether
associated subsurface deposits were present (Table 10; see Figure 15). The feature is eroded, and
few of the rocks on the surface appear to have integrity. It does not have an obvious subsurface
extent. This western edge of the site is where the terrace is broadest and best-defined, though
bulldozing in probable association with the well pad to the north-northeast of the site area has
leveled the terrace and likely destroyed any subsurface deposits in the northern part.
As bedrock is exposed not only on the hill, but also on its lower slopes, five other shovel tests
were excavated on the southwestern terrace (see Table 10). Three of these, ST 2, 3, and MC9,
were positive for subsurface deposits. Four total shovel tests (ST 1, 4, 5, and 6) lacked
subsurface cultural deposits.
In Shovel Test 2, a single tested chert cobble was recovered from between 30â40 cm below the
modern ground surface from within a compact sandy silt matrix. In ST 3, a core reduction flake,
a biface thinning flake, an indeterminate flake fragment, and a single piece of shatter were all
identified from the top 15 cm of deposits in fine silty sand. All four artifacts were made from
chert, and none were further modified. A biface thinning flake was recovered from 40-cm below
the modern ground surface in shovel test MC9. No fire-cracked rock fragments were identified
among the subsurface deposits.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP811, while substantially larger in horizontal extent than previously recorded, is
primarily a lithic raw materials procurement site associated with the gravel capped hill and its
lower slopes. Artifacts are plentiful on the gravel slopes, but limited below the slopes, and no
temporally diagnostic items were identified. A single fire-cracked rock feature was identified at
this site, though several others had been previously recorded as being in the area. The previously
recorded features appear, in fact, to be natural bedrock exposures. The single feature remaining,
on the western terrace edge of the site, is heavily eroded and does not appear to retain integrity.
Subsurface deposits, even on this terrace, are minimal. Site 41ZP811 is therefore recommended
as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

70

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Site 41ZP815
Previous Investigations
Site 41ZP815 is a primary lithic raw material procurement site originally in 2001 as part of a
large reconnaissance survey at Falcon Reservoir (Parsons 2002:180â181). It is described as being
a sparse scatter of primary and secondary lithic debitage across a dissected and heavily eroded
slope. A single feature consisting of a 0.9-m cluster of unburned sandstone was identified at the
site. The site was measured as being 115-x-40 m in diameter, and having an area of 4,600 m2.
Mesquite, prickly pear, whitethorn, and retama obscure parts of the site, and ground visibility is
described as being between 30 and 50 percent. Impacts to the site are described as including
slope and shoreline erosion; a small stock tank is in the drainage bottom to the west, but does not
appear to have disturbed the cultural deposits. Research potential for the site was determined to
be low because the feature was not definitely identified as prehistoric in age and because of the
presence of heavy erosion.

Present Investigations
Site 41ZP815 was revisited and rerecorded by archaeologists from GMI in 2005 in order to
evaluate the single feature previously documented for possible data recovery (Figures 16 and 17;
see site sketch map accompanying site form in Appendix 1). It is located on the east bank of a
tributary drainage of Arroyo Burro, but on a slight slope below a large, relatively level terrace
(see Figure 6). The site was identified as being of smaller size (90 m by 35 m, or 2,965 m2) than
originally recorded and slightly to the northwest of its original plotting.
Visibility across the site area was excellent, at 90 percent, with only low grasses sparsely
covering areas of exposed bedrock and some small gravels. The slope on which the site lay is
approximately at 20 degrees. No artifacts were collected from the site, either from the surface or
from subsurface deposits.

Surface Investigations
This site consists of a sparse scatter of chipped stone debitage and four biface fragments. No
diagnostic artifacts were identified. The rock feature was located, but as a recent cultural
disturbance, not a historic or prehistoric feature. Caliche-encrusted, naturally-broken sandstone
fragments and small chunks of carbonate are exposed in a relatively recently disturbed area, and
this is thought to be the âfeatureâ as previously recorded. These stones and caliche nodules are
exposed in a presumed bulldozer cut, only faintly visible. Slight berms of sediment are visible on
each side of the disturbed swath. No artifacts are visible in the area near the feature and no
staining was visible on the ground surface.

Subsurface Investigations
Two shovel tests were excavated at the site in attempts to identify subsurface deposits despite the
extensive bedrock exposures and obvious disturbance across the site (Table 11; see Figure 16).
Shovel Test 1 was located in the near vicinity of the âfeature,â just downslope and on the edge of
the bulldozed area. Shovel Test 2 was to the north, slightly downslope of some bedrock
exposures near where one of the bifacial chipped stone tools was located. Neither shovel test was
positive for subsurface cultural deposits.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP815 is a heavily eroded site with a limited surface assemblage and a nonexistent
subsurface extent. The few artifacts that are visible may be eroded, in fact, off the terrace above
the site (and outside the project boundary). The fire-cracked rock feature previously identified at
the site was determined, during the present project, to be a natural exposure of sandstone. Shovel
testing indicated that there is not a subsurface extent to the limited assemblage. Site 41ZP815 is
therefore recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP816
Previous Investigations
Site 41ZP816 was recorded in 2001 during a reconnaissance survey of parts of Falcon Reservoir
(Parsons 2002:181â182). It was recorded as being on a possible T3 terrace remnant on the west
bank of a small tributary to Arroyo Burro (see Figure 6). Across this small drainage is 41ZP815.
The ground slope is less than in the area across the drainage, with ground visibility noted as being
around 85 percent.
The site was recorded as approximately 60-x-57 m in size, totaling an area of 3,420 m2. The site
is described as consisting of a sparse chipped stone scatter with two associated burned rock
hearths, each less than 40 cm in diameter. The scatter consisted of only tertiary flakes and tested
cobbles. Slope erosion of the site was thought to be minimal, and the research potential of the
site was considered to be good.
Present Investigations
The site was revisited and documented by GMI archaeologists in 2005 as part of the initial feature
assessments, later abandoned. The site is located atop the slope leading upward from the
drainage, on relatively level ground. This elevated landform is southeast of and overlooking the
tributary drainage. This revisited site matches well with the described location from the 2001 site
form, but its UTM coordinates do not; its plotted location as provided in data from the USIBWC,
however, does match the location of the revisited site. Sparse prickly pear and mesquite
dominate the vegetation toward the edge of the rise, while dense mesquite, huisache and
whitethorn dominate in the area slightly farther away from the sloping surface.
The site dimensions and shape changed dramatically from those previously documented (Figure
18). The site is now plotted as being almost 50 m to the northwest of its original plotting. It is
linearly located along the edge of the bluff overlooking the drainage, extending 87 m from
southwest to northeast along the bluff edge, and 30 m from southeast to northwest, perpendicular
to the bluff edge. It has a total site area of 1,277 m2.

Surface Investigations
On the modern ground surface, both historic and prehistoric artifacts were noted, and the only
feature noted on the surface has a probable historic-era association (see site and feature sketch
maps accompanying site form in Appendix 1). About 30 chipped stone are scattered across the
surface of the site. All are made of chert, and no diagnostic forms or formal tools of any sort
were noted. The debitage consists mostly of tertiary debitage, and these flakes are accompanied
by four or five tested cobbles.
A rock alignment and four piles of debris were noted on the surface; the alignment and a nearby
pushpile were investigated as the previously noted features. Approximately 21 pieces of
sandstone were found in an area measuring 4.2 m east-west by 3.0 m north-south (Feature 1).
Although unburned, some of these rocks appear to be aligned with one another, forming the base
of two possible walls of a structure. The sandstone blocks are not noticeably shaped, and range in
size from roughly 10-x-10 cm to 15-x-15 cm. Six, and possibly as many as eight, stones are
approximately aligned along a northwest to southeast-trending line, and there is the suggestion of
a second alignment perpendicular to this one, trending to the southwest. A third possible
alignment was identified trending parallel to the first, and thus possibly defining the base rocks of
a stone three-walled structure. Other sandstones are scattered about, primarily to the north and
east of these possible alignments.
Three concentrations of debris were also identified across the surface of the site. Approximately
2 m downslope of the possible rock alignments is a small pushpile of burned debris that measures
2-x-3 m in area and is approximately 0.75 m high. This pushpile consists of sandstone fragments,
wood, and other debris and was designated Feature 2. Downslope of this pile by another 5 m is a
second, yet smaller, pile of debris (not mapped) that includes at least one cinder block. Finally, a
third, and larger, debris pile is located to the western edge of the site. No datable historic or
recent items were identified in any of these debris piles.

Subsurface Investigations
Three shovel tests were excavated on the site to evaluate the nature and extent of subsurface
deposits in association with the possible feature and to further evaluate the prehistoric deposits
(Table 12). Shovel Test 1 was located among the scattered sandstone fragments approximately
0.5 m to the east of the possible alignments. Additional sandstone blocks were encountered in the
shovel test at 18 cm depth, but no artifacts were noted. Shovel Test 2, located within the
presumed pushpile (Feature 2) slightly downslope of the possible wall alignments, had both
historic and prehistoric artifacts, but the deposits were clearly mixed. A single piece of chipped
stone debitage was recovered from the 0â20-cm depth and the 40â45-cm depth, and a brown
bottle glass fragment was recovered from the 20â40-cm depth.
Chipped stone debitage and a bullet of unknown caliber were recovered from the top 20 cm in
Shovel Test 3, which was located farther downslope and along the southern site boundary. The
mixing of historic and prehistoric artifacts in Shovel Tests 2 and 3 appears to demonstrate
considerable mixing of the deposits on the site.

Site Summary and Recommendations
This site does not appear to have prehistoric features, though there is a light scatter of chipped
stone debitage across the modern ground surface. No formal tools were noted. As it is atop a
slight terrace, there is only very slight erosion of the site, but considerable disturbances were
otherwise noted. Three pushpiles are present, with both historic and prehistoric refuse visible in
the piles. Shovel testing in and around these disturbances indicates mixing of the two
components. Feature 1, the only feature ultimately defined as such, is not prehistoric in
association, as previously identified, but rather of unknown historic association. It is a foundation
of a structure, and part may still retain integrity as more sandstone was encountered during shovel
testing, but the refuse found in the area is not diagnostic, and there is little by which to date the
historic component. Given the obvious disturbances to the site, the prehistoric component lacks
integrity and consists of no artifacts that can add data to our knowledge of the region. The
historic component appears to be also disturbed and lacks temporally diagnostic artifacts by
which to date it. Site 41ZP816 is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Newly Recorded Sites

Site 41ZP927
GMI archaeologists recorded site 41ZP927 during the 2005 investigations. This is a flaked lithic
scatter located on the flat crest of a hillslope southeast of the juncture of two tributary drainages
to Arroyo Burro (see Figure 6). Its location is adjacent to an eastern boundary of the project area,
and may continue outside the project bounds. Its landform is fairly small, and the site appears to
fill the landform as present within the project area boundary.
77

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

The site area measures 700 m2, with dimensions of 34 m north-south by 31 m east-west (Figure
19). The site area is characterized as having dense huisache and short grasses; ground visibility is
estimated at 75 percent. Lag gravels are present across the site.

Surface Investigations
Approximately 700 pieces of chipped stone are scattered among the gravels. The lithic artifacts
consist of approximately 70 or so tested cobbles and cores and more than 600 pieces of debitage.
Debitage includes primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes from core reduction and tool
manufacture, but no formal tools were identified. No artifacts were collected from the modern
ground surface.
Subsurface Investigations
Two shovel tests were excavated on this small knoll to test for the presence of intact subsurface
cultural deposits (Table 13). So few shovel tests were excavated, in spite of the density of
cultural materials, because bedrock was exposed across much of the site area, and lag gravels
dominated the remainder. Subsurface deposits were thought to be minimal on this surface, and
all indications are that the site fills this small, relatively level landform. Both shovel tests were
terminated at shallow depths, encountering bedrock at 15 and 20 cm below the modern ground
surface. Chipped stone debitage was collected from these shallow levels in both tests.
Shovel Test 1 was excavated into a clear deposit of gravels near the project boundary.
Nonetheless, it was excavated into loamy sand sediment, which extended to bedrock at 15 cm
depth. Two core reduction flakes and a biface thinning flake were recovered from this shallow
test; all were made from various types of chert and one showed evidence of heat-treating.
A single indeterminate flake fragment of chert was recovered from the top 20 cm in Shovel Test
2. This test was located approximately 6 m to the southwest of Shovel Test 1, and was also
excavated into the gravel surface. The sediments in this test were very similar to those in Shovel
Test 1, and again overlay shallowly buried bedrock.
Site Summary and Recommendations
This site consists of a dense surface scatter of chipped stone artifacts with a very shallow
subsurface extent. Chipped stone artifacts consist entirely of primary core reduction materials,
and no formal tools were noted. No features were present, and subsurface testing indicates that
bedrock is buried just below the surface. Site 41ZP927 then is recommended as ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP928
Site 41ZP928 was recorded in 2005 by GMI archaeologists. It is located near the western project
boundary and may continue westward outside the project bounds (see Figure 6). It is on a toeslope of a low hill, overlooking a small southward-trending tributary to Arroyo Burro. Artifacts

are scattered across a slightly sloping surface on which bedrock is exposed and gravels are
strewn. The site encompasses an approximately 1,593-m2 area, and measures 54 m north-south
by 50 m east-west in maximum dimensions (Figure 20).

Surface Investigations
Artifacts on the modern ground surface consist of lithic debitage, cores, and tested cobbles. No
formal tools were noted. Approximately 75 artifacts were noted across the surface. They are
relatively sparsely distributed across the site area, in densities of approximately 5â10 artifacts per
square meter in the most concentrated areas along the north edge of the site, just south of the
point where bedrock becomes most common and dominates the hill above the site. No artifacts
were collected from the surface of the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Seven shovel tests were excavated across the site (Table 14). The site appears once again to fill
the small landform, though relatively flat surfaces on the hillslope above the site and just below
the site were also tested.
Cultural materials were recovered from Shovel Tests 1, 2, and 7. A single primary core reduction
flake was recovered from 0â20 cm in Shovel Test 1. A split tested cobble was recovered from
the top 10 cm in Shovel Test 2, and two core reduction flakes and a piece of shatter were
recovered from the top 9-cm in Shovel Test 7. These were the three shovel tests located on the
most level, centralized part of the site. All shovel tests were quite shallow; the deepest, excavated
to 25â30 cm below the ground surface, exposed weathered bedrock toward the bottom of the
tests.

Site Summary and Recommendations
This site is a sparse, predominantly surface, scatter of chipped stone artifacts with a very shallow
subsurface extent. Chipped stone artifacts consist entirely of primary core reduction materials,
and no formal tools were noted. No features were present, and shovel testing indicates that
bedrock is buried, at most, 30 cm below the surface. Site 41ZP928 is therefore recommended as
not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP935
Site 41ZP935 was recorded in 2005 by GMI archaeologists. It is near a western project boundary
along Arroyo Las Palomas and continues westward outside the project bounds (see Figure 6). It
is on a relatively level bench, or terrace, overlooking Arroyo Las Palomas, a small southwardtrending tributary to Arroyo Burro. The site encompasses an approximately 1,590-m2 area,
measuring 32 m north-south by 63 m east-west in maximum dimension (Figure 21).
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2005, apparently lies in part outside properties
under the jurisdiction of the USIBWC. Property markers were not found in this immediate area,
and it was not until data were processed in the lab that GMI was made aware of this site being
partly investigated outside the project boundary.
Vegetation in the site area is moderate, providing ground surface visibility of approximately 60
percent. Mesquite, huisache, prickly pear, and short grasses are common. A 1.5-m deep cutbank
of the arroyo defines the east edge of the site, but no cultural debris was visible in the profile.
The site boundary, based primarily on the distribution of artifacts, coincides approximately with
the relatively flat landform on which the site lies.
Surface Investigations
Approximately 25 lithic artifacts and a few fragments of fire-cracked sandstone are visible across
the surface of the site. The chipped stone artifacts consist of two bifaces, three cores, a tested
cobble, and an otherwise light scatter of debitage. Primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes are

present, as are several pieces of shatter. One of the bifaces is a Stage 2 tool fragment, with large,
relatively irregular flakes removed from each face. The other is a probable Stage 4 biface
fragment. Both chert and quartzite are represented among the artifacts, though chert dominates
the assemblage. No artifacts were collected from the surface of the site.
Scattered among the lithic artifacts are approximately five fragments of fire-cracked sandstone.
These fragments, however, are widely dispersed and are thought not to represent even a partly
intact portion of a feature.

Subsurface Investigations
Three shovel tests were excavated at site 41ZP935. Two of these (Shovel Test 1 and 3) were
excavated within the boundary of the site, and one (Shovel Test 2) was located slightly
downslope, just above the cutbank and just outside the site boundary. A single chipped stone
artifact was recovered from the top 20 cm in Shovel Test 3 (Table 15); no other artifacts were
noted in the relatively shallow subsurface deposits. This artifact is a bifacially modified split
chert cobble, with cortex remaining across most of the dorsal surface. Two edges of the ovalshaped tool were modified, leaving cobble cortex along the other edges. The working edge
created by modification is relatively steeply angled.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP935 consists of a relatively sparse scatter of 25 or 30 artifacts representing primary and,
less so, secondary core reduction activities. Two bifacially modified tools were identified on the
surface, though no diagnostic forms were noted. The site is almost entirely a surface
manifestation as shovel testing and visual inspection of an exposed cutbank profile indicate little
subsurface extent. Given the limited size of the landform, the shallow deposits as indicated by
the excavation of three shovel tests, and the lack of diagnostic tool forms, site 41ZP935 is
recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Site 41ZP936
Site 41ZP936 was recorded in 2005 by GMI archaeologists. It is south of Arroyo Burro, near a
southern project boundary, and likely continues southward outside the project bounds (see Figure
6). It is on a relatively level bench, at the base of a gently sloping hill. The site encompasses an
approximately 3,905-m2 area, measuring 108 m northeast-southwest by 48 m northwest-southeast
in maximum dimensions (Figure 22; see site and feature sketch maps accompanying site form in
Appendix 1). It abuts a historic site with a surface chipped stone scatter to the north (41ZP938;
see Figure 6).
Vegetation in the site area is sparse, providing ground surface visibility of approximately 95
percent. Scattered mesquite, huisache, prickly pear, and short grasses are present across the site,
particularly in the vicinity of the shallow gully running through it (see Figure 22). The site
boundary, based primarily on the distribution of artifacts, coincides approximately with the
relatively flat landform on which the site lies. The ground surface dips again to the north toward
Arroyo Burro, providing a second flat bench on which the adjacent site, 41ZP938, lies.
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2005, apparently lies in part outside properties
under the jurisdiction of the USIBWC. Property markers were not found in this immediate area,
and it was not until data were processed in the lab that GMI was made aware of this site being
partly investigated outside the project boundary.

Surface Investigations
Artifacts strewn across the surface of this site are present in relatively high density, reaching a
maximum of approximately 35 artifacts per square meter. Fire-cracked rock, abundant chipped
stone debitage, and approximately 20 formal tools in various stages of reduction were visible
across the siteâs surface. Diagnostic formal tool forms were present, and 16 bifacially modified
formal tools were collected from the surface (Table 16). The formal tools were found on the
surface in three clusters: one to the west, one in the central area, and one to the east. The western
cluster, consisting of Artifacts 1, 3, 4, 5, and 12, measures approximately 20 m east-west by 11 m
north-south. The central cluster, along and within a small gully, measures 31 m east-west by 8 m
north-south and included Artifacts 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13. A third, much smaller cluster lies
to the east and measures approximately 10 m east-west by 7 m north-south. Artifacts 14, 15, and
16 were collected in this area, and a fourth biface was noted and mapped.
Collected artifacts from surface contexts include four that are relatively temporally diagnostic:
two identified as Tortugas dart points (Artifacts 2 and 3), one as a probable Charcos dart point
(Artifact 5), and one as the base of an Angostura dart point (Artifact 10). These indicate Late
Paleo-Indian to Late Archaic period temporal affiliations. All are of chert, and the raw materials,
dimensions, and condition in which each was recovered are shown in Table 16.
Three of the collected tools are relatively thick, early- to mid-stage bifaces. Two are made of
chert, while the third is made from a partly silicified siltstone. One is just the base of a thick
biface about which little else can be discerned (Artifact #8). The distal fragment of a second
thick biface (Artifact #7) shows some of the difficulties in reducing some of these chert cobble
materials; it appears to have fractured during manufacture due to difficulties in removing cortex.

Hinging is readily evident on one face of the tool. The third (Artifact #11) is a complete biface
with alternately beveled edges. Another thick biface (Artifact #14) is a probable near-complete
Clear Fork biface. It does not have a particularly steep, beveled, broad end, but its general
morphology, including a relatively flat dorsal surface and âhumpedâ ventral surface with cortex
remaining on the highest protruding portion, is suggestive of the smaller Clear Fork tools that are
particularly common across South Texas. The other eight formal tools collected from the surface
of the site are all classified as thin, or late-stage, bifaces. Some show manufacturing difficulties,
such as hinging during efforts to remove cortex (i.e., Artifact 4), or the possible bending fractures
on Artifacts 13 and 16.
A single, somewhat dispersed fire-cracked rock feature was also noted on the modern ground
surface. Thirty-two fragments of fire-cracked sandstone were within a 1.9-x-3.2-m area and
designated Feature 1. It is located near the central cluster of bifacial tools, near the small gully
that runs through the site. Other fragments of fire-cracked rock were noted across the surface of
the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Five shovel tests were excavated within the site boundary (Table 17; see Figure 22). These tests
were generally shallow, with none extending further than 60 cm below the modern ground
surface. Two each were placed in the vicinity of the more concentrated areas of formal tools, and

one was placed in the vicinity of the smaller, eastern cluster. Cultural materials were recovered to
depths of 40 cm below the modern ground surface, though 14 of the total 16 artifacts recovered
from subsurface contexts were found between the ground surface and 20-cm depth. No firecracked rock fragments were noted in any of the shovel tests.
Shovel Tests 1 and 5 were excavated in the area of the central cluster. From Shovel Test #1, a
core reduction flake, a biface thinning flake, and an edge-modified flake were all recovered from
0â20 cm below the modern ground surface. A single core reduction flake was also recovered
from 20â40 cm below modern ground surface. All four of these artifacts were made of chert. No
artifacts were recovered from Shovel Test 5, which was excavated into the bottom of the small
gully (30 cm deeper than the surrounding ground surface).
Shovel Tests 2 and 3 were excavated in the area near the western cluster of artifacts. In Shovel
Test 2, two flakes of chert debitage were recovered from between 0â20 cm below surface and one
flake from 20â40 cm below surface. All three are core reduction flakes, and all are of chert. Two
pieces of chert debitageâone a core reduction flake and one an indeterminate fragmentâwere
found in the top 20 cm of Shovel Test 3.
Shovel Test 4 was located near the eastern, smaller cluster of artifacts and formal tools. Seven
pieces of chert debitage were found in the top 20 cm in Shovel Test 4. These seven artifacts
consisted of two core reduction flakes, two biface thinning flakes, and three indeterminate flake
fragments.

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP936 is a lithic materials procurement site and open camp. A single, eroded fire-cracked
rock feature was identified on the surface of the site and other fire-cracked rock fragments were
also noted. There is a high density of chipped stone artifacts across the surface, consisting of
both core reduction and biface production debris. About 20 bifacially modified tools were
identified in the surface assemblage, and diagnostic forms among them indicate use over a broad
span of the prehistoric era. Late Paleo-Indian through Archaic dart forms were identified. The
subsurface deposits, as established through shovel testing, appear shallow. As the surface
assemblage indicates a palimpsest spanning from the Paleo-Indian to at least the Late Archaic
periods and the subsurface deposits are quite shallow, the site lacks contextual associations that
would provide data specific to any one time period. Site 41ZP936 is therefore recommended as
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP937
Site 41ZP937 was recorded in 2005 by GMI archaeologists. It is south of Arroyo Burro, adjacent
to a southern project boundary, and likely continues southward upslope and outside the project
bounds (see Figure 6). It is on a slightly sloping toe of a gently sloping hill. The site
encompasses an approximately 20,200-m2 area, measuring 160 m north-south by 170 m east-west
in maximum dimensions (Figure 23).
Vegetation in the site area is moderate, providing ground surface visibility of approximately 60
percent. Scattered mesquite and short grasses are present across the site. The site boundary,
based both on the distribution of artifacts and positive shovel tests, coincides approximately with
the relatively flat landform on which the site lies. The ground surface dips again to the north
toward Arroyo Burro, thus further defining the landform.

Surface Investigations
Artifacts strewn across the surface of this site are present in a relatively low density, reaching a
maximum of approximately 10 artifacts per square meter. A total of approximately 45 artifacts
was visible on the surface. Scattered fire-cracked rock, chipped stone debitage, and a few formal
tools representing various stages of manufacture were visible across the site surface. Diagnostic
formal tool forms were present, and six bifacially modified formal tools were collected from the
surface.
Collected artifacts from surface contexts include four that are relatively temporally diagnostic of
Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric (Turner and Hester 1999) occupation: one is a probable
Matamoros point, and two are likely Catan points. A bifacial Clear Fork tool was also collected
from the surface. All are of chert, and the dimensions and chert types of each vary. Two other
late-stage bifaces were also collected.

Subsurface Investigations
Two shovel tests were excavated within the site boundary (Table 18; see Figure 23). One other,
Shovel Test J10, was excavated just off this level toe to the northeast. Only the off-site test was
relatively shallow, excavated to 60-cm depth in sterile deposits. The two onsite tests were each
excavated to 100-cm depth, with artifacts and/or fire-cracked rock being noted to the bottom of
the stratigraphic sequence.

The deposits in Shovel Test J7 were identified as loamy fine sand through 100-cm depth, but the
sediments are darker and more compacted in the bottommost 20 cm. A single, distal, mid- to
late-stage biface fragment was recovered from 0â20 cm in depth. Two indeterminate flake
fragments and a heat-fractured piece of shatter were recovered from 40â60 cm in depth, and two
small flake fragments were identified from the 80â100-cm depth.
Shovel Test J8, located more toward the downward sloping edge of this toe, should also be
considered as having a high potential for deeply buried deposits. Loamy fine sand continued to
the bottom of excavations at 100-cm depth. Seventeen flakes and flake fragments, and an
exhausted core were recovered from 0â20 cm in depth. Fire-cracked rock was also noted. The
debitage consists of six biface thinning flakes, one core reduction flake, nine indeterminate flake
fragments, and a piece of shatter. From 20â40 cm in depth, two indeterminate flake fragments
and a blocky chunk of heat-fractured chert were identified. Fire-cracked sandstone was noted
between 40â60 cm depth, and also noted between 60â80 cm depth. A single flake fragment each
was recovered from 60â80 cm and from 80â100 cm depth.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP937 is an extensive surface lithic scatter with a subsurface extent and a potential for
relatively deeply buried and intact deposits. The surface assemblage includes diagnostic chipped
stone tools and various stages of both core reduction and biface manufacture. Shovel testing
indicates that cultural materials, including chipped stone artifacts and fire-cracked rock
fragments, extend to 1 m below surface; both, however, are sparse within these deeper deposits.
Further testing of these deposits is needed to establish whether this site retains contextual
integrity and might address regional research. Therefore, the eligibility of site 41ZP937 for
inclusion in the NRHP is presently recommended as unknown.

Site 41ZP938
Site 41ZP938, located immediately north of and adjacent to site 41ZP936, is a historic ranch
complex with a surface chipped stone artifact scatter. It is immediately downslope, and on a
slightly separated bench or level surface, from site 41ZP936 and thus has been designated as a
separate site (see Figure 6). It was recorded in 2005 by GMI archaeologists.
The site encompasses an approximately 8,318-m2 area, measuring 94 m north-south by 111 m
east-west in maximum dimensions (Figure 24; see site and feature sketch maps accompanying
site form in Appendix 1). The ranching complex, consisting of a residential structure, barn or
shed, corral loading chute, stock pond, and latrine, probably dates to the 1930s. The chipped
stone scatter, extending into the subsurface, is considered to be of unknown Archaic period
affiliation.
Vegetation in the site area is relatively sparse, providing ground surface visibility of
approximately 85 percent. Scattered mesquite, huisache, and prickly pear are present in the larger
vicinity, and scattered leafy shrubs are located in the immediate area of the ranching complex.
The site boundary coincides approximately with the relatively flat landform on which the site lies.
The ground surface dips again to the north into Arroyo Burro.

Surface Investigations
Seven features associated with the historic component were identified across the surface of the
site (see Figure 24). These were all identified within a 73-m northwest-southeast by 53-m
northeast-southwest core area of the site. Features 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are all within a fenced-in
area, and Feature 4 is nearby to the southeast.
Feature 1 is the residence. It is a wood frame house 5.0-x-6.0 m in dimension, with tar paper and
shingle siding (faux brick motif, tan gravel) on a poured concrete slab foundation. Doors open on
the southwest and northwest sides of the house. It has a gabled tin roof and an open air shed with
wood support posts on the back side of the structure.
Feature 2 is a 13-x-5.7-m shed extending southwest to northeast. It is on the opposite side of the
fenced-in area that approximately further defines the core of the site. The shed has a dirt floor,
corrugated tin walls and roof, no windows, and instead of a door, just an opening in the southeast
corner.

Feature 3, a barbeque pit or outdoor oven, is approximately 1-x-1 m in dimension, and made of
brick, cinderblock, and sandstone. These various materials are pieced together into a âCâ shape,
opening toward the house, to its southeast.
Feature 5 is the remains of an outhouse. It is constructed of corrugated metal on a wood frame.
A toilet seat is still in place, though the structure itself has tipped over onto one side.
Feature 6 is a depression located near the southwest corner of the fenced-in area. It is
approximately 2 m in diameter, and has charcoal and other refuse on top. No artifacts or
associated materials were evident that might give a better idea of the purpose of the depression.
Feature 7 is a two-pen wooden corral that abuts the southwest end of the shed. It consists of two
adjacent pens and a loading chute. Together, the pens and loading chute encompass an area of
roughly 25-x-25 m.
Feature 4 is an earthen dam and stock pond, located to the southeast of the fenced enclosure. The
dam is 32 m in length, with a maximum height of 1.5 m. The pond, to the northeast of the dam,
measures 20-x-20 m in size.
Also identified across the site are a farm hopper, thresher, and a truck bed, all from the historic
use of the site, and various refuse, including crown bottle caps, horse tack, remnants of rubber
hoses, bed springs, clear window glass, sardine cans, a drill bit from an oil rig, tin cans, brown
bottle glass, a propane heater, red âLaredoâ bricks, cinder blocks, a cast-iron stove, food bottles
and jars, and tractor tires. Several small gullies are approximately 60 m to the north of the
ranching complex, and these gullies are somewhat filled with various refuse, likely related to use
of this ranching complex.
In addition to the historic component, about 75 scattered pieces of chipped stone debris and tools
were also identified. It is relatively low density, scattered across an area immediately outlying
the ranching complex in all directions. Two biface fragments were collected from the surface of
the site (see Figure 24).
The basal end of a probable Matamoros point (Artifact 1) was collected from just outside the
fenced area near the northeastern site boundary. It is only a basal fragment, but has been clearly
shaped and finely pressure-flaked. The base is relatively straight, and the lateral edges are
beginning to turn toward forming a triangular point. A biface fragment (Artifact #2) with serrated
lateral edges and a reworked edge where a larger tool had clearly broken was collected from the
surface 7 m northwest of Artifact #1. Both are of chert.
Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated across the site (Table 19). Shovel Tests 1, 2, 5, and 6 were
excavated in the vicinity of Features 1, 3, and 5, which are clustered toward the southwest edge of
the fenced-in area. Shovel Test 3 is just outside the fenced area to the southeast, near where the
bifaces were found, and Shovel Test 4 was placed near the southeast entryway into the shed
(Feature 2; see Figure 24). Historic, and possibly recent, items were recovered from Shovel
Tests 1, 2, 3, and 6, and chipped stone debitage was recovered from Shovel Tests 1, 3, 5, and 6.
Artifacts were recovered to depths of 70 cm below the modern ground surface.

None of the historic or recent (e.g., string) items could be definitively identified to a particular
object or era. Fragments of clear glass, a possible nail fragment, concrete chunks, unidentified
metal fragments, and some cloth were all recovered from the shovel tests. In addition, 22 pieces
of lithic debitage were also found, often in the same stratum and at the same approximate depth as
the historic or recent items. These 22 lithic artifacts include five core reduction flakes, six biface
thinning flakes, nine indeterminate flake fragments, and two pieces of shatter. All are of various
chert types and textures.

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

The artifacts found in Shovel Test 6 appear to be the most disturbed; chipped stone debitage was
recovered from 20â30-cm depth, and historic items were recovered from 30â50-cm depth.
Additionally, in the top 20 cm each of Shovel Tests 1 and 3, historic items and chipped stone
debitage were both noted.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP938 is a multicomponent site with a chipped stone artifact scatter and various features
associated with a historic ranching complex. The prehistoric component consists of a limited
surface scatter of chipped stone debris associated with core reduction and tool production
activities. A single projectile point fragment was identified as the base of a probable Matamoros
point. For the most part, however, this component is limited and is not associated with
potentially dateable features. The historic component of the site, dating most likely to the 1930s,
consists of various features associated with a historic ranching complex, which appears to still be
used for storage, at least, and is in good condition. Archival research related to the ranching
industry and the potential significance of this particular site is recommended before an eligibility
recommendation regarding this component of the site can be made. The eligibility of this site for
listing in the NRHP is therefore presently recommended as unknown.

Site 41ZP939
Site 41ZP939 was recorded in 2005 by GMI archaeologists. It is along the south side of Arroyo
Burro, along the upper reaches of the reservoir (see Figure 6). A gully, up to 2.0 m deep, runs
northwestward through the eastern part of the site. The site encompasses an approximately 9,090
m2 area, measuring 125 m north-south by 101 m east-west in maximum dimensions (Figure 25).
The site, as recorded in 2005, apparently lies outside properties under the jurisdiction of
USIBWC. Property markers were not found in this immediate area, and it was not until data were
processed in the lab that GMI was made aware of this site being investigated outside the project
boundary.
Vegetation in the site area is moderate, providing ground surface visibility of approximately 75
percent. Scattered mesquite, prickly pear, and short grasses are present across the site. The site
boundary is based on the distribution of artifacts across the surface of the site. In addition to the
apparent recent channeling of the gully, a large area on the north side of the gully has been bulldozed, and several artifacts are present atop the pushpiles.

Surface Investigations
Artifacts strewn across the surface of this site are present in moderate densities, reaching a
maximum of approximately 10 artifacts in one square meter area. Approximately 100 artifacts
were noted. Scattered fragments of fire-cracked rock, chipped stone debitage, and a few formal
tools representing various stages of manufacture were visible across the siteâs surface. Diagnostic
formal tool forms were present, and 10 bifacially modified formal tools were collected from the
surface. A unifacial gouge, a core, and one piece of modified debitage were also collected.

Collected artifacts from surface contexts include two that are relatively temporally diagnostic of
Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric (Turner and Hester 1999) occupation: both are likely Catan
points. All the formal tools are made of chert, and the dimensions and chert types of each vary.
Other bifaces include early to late-stage forms.

Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated within the site boundary (Table 20; see Figure 25). Sediments in
all shovel tests were generally homogenous, loamy fine sand to fine sandy silt. Three were
excavated to 1.0-m depth, and in all three, debitage was recovered through the bottom of the
stratigraphic sequence. A total of 33 pieces of debitage was recovered from subsurface contexts.

Site Summary and Recommendations
This site consists of a moderate surface scatter of chipped stone artifacts with associated,
potentially deep, subsurface deposits. The surface assemblage is not extensive, but included at
least 10 formal tools in various stages of manufacture and two probable Catan points, placing the
assemblage into a Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric context. No features were present, but
subsurface testing indicates that cultural materials extend to at least a meter below the modern
ground surface. Site 41ZP939 however, apparently lies outside the project area boundary, and
thus an eligibility determination is not appropriate.

Site 41ZP940
Site 41ZP940 is located on an L-shaped, low-rising, sandy ridge near the confluence of Las
Palomas Creek, running from the north, and Arroyo Burro, running from the northeast. It was
documented by GMI archaeologists in 2005 and 2006 (see Figure 6). This sandy ridge rises
approximately 1.75 m above the surrounding bottomland, and artifacts may be seen eroding from
the edges of the ridge. The site encompasses an approximately 7,039-m2 area, measuring 156 m
north-south by 82 m east-west in maximum dimensions (Figure 26).
GMI archaeologists recording this site in 2005 noted only chipped stone debitage in the
southeastern portion of the ridge. Shovel testing was conducted at that time, defining a small area
as the site. In 2006, GMI archaeologists again noted the ridge and, while on transect survey, also
observed chipped stone artifacts on the surface in an area approximately 120 m northwest of the
previously documented site. Once it was determined that this was the same sandy ridge on which
previously documented temporary site L-8 lay, shovel testing and pedestrian survey were used to
connect the two occurrences and determine that they were both part of the same site, thus the 12
shovel tests and some duplication of effort on this single site. The shovel tests discussed below,
then, have been designated with different temporary site numbers in order to separate the
different years of investigation.
Vegetation in the site area is extremely dense, providing ground surface visibility of less than 40
percent along much of the ridge. Dense mesquite, acacia, huisache, and prickly pear are present
in the site vicinity, and scattered thorny shrubs were also noted. The site boundary corresponds
very well with the boundary of this low sandy ridge.

Surface Investigations
There is a low-density chipped stone and fire-cracked rock scatter visible across the entire surface
of the ridge. The density is in the range of no more than 7 artifacts per square meter in the
densest of areas, and generally more in the range of 1â2 artifacts per square meter. However,
chipped stone debitage and fire-cracked rock fragments are visible eroding out along the edges of
the ridge, in all directions, as one walks the perimeter of the site. Artifacts are scattered away
from the edge of the ridge on the lower landform for distances of 3â5 m.

Chapter 5: Survey Results

About 60 pieces of chipped stone and fragments of fire-cracked rock were observed across the
surface of the site. Among these were five formal tools; three were extremely thick, early-stage
specimens, one was a medial fragment of a thin, late-stage biface, and two were examples of latestage bifaces. One of these (Artifact #4) was collected from the surface of the site. This latestage biface, made of a grayish tan chalcedonic chert, is likely not finished, but has a thinned,
lenticular shape in cross section, fine pressure-flaking along all edges, and a concave base. It is
just the basal 3.8 cm of the biface, but may be the base of either a Kinney point or, as is suggested
for other similar forms, a knife rather than a point. No other surface artifacts were collected.
A single relative cluster of fire-cracked rock was noted in the north part of the site (see Figure
26). Feature 1, as it was designated, consists of seven fragments of fire-cracked rock in a 2-x-2-m
area, on a slightly sloping surface that has been subject to some erosion. A few pieces of chipped
stone debitage were also observed in the general area.

Subsurface Investigations
A total of 13 shovel tests was excavated across the sandy ridge (Table 21). Seven tests (from
2005) were placed in a relatively tight cluster in the southeast part of the site, while six others
(from 2006) were more scattered across the top of the landform to determine whether the siteâs
extent corresponds with that of the landform itself (see Figure 26). These tests ranged greatly in
depth before encountering sterile deposits. Only four of the total tests, three of which are located
in the southeastern cluster, failed to reveal subsurface cultural deposits.
Fire-cracked rock and/or small chunks of charcoal were noted in Shovel Tests 2, 5, L8-1, and L84. Fire-cracked rock was encountered to depths of 60 cm, and a substantial amount of small bits
of charcoal was encountered between 60â80 cm depth in Shovel Test 5. These four tests are
spread widely across the surface of the ridge (see Figure 26) and thus indicate a potential across
the site for buried features and other intact subsurface deposits.
Chipped stone artifacts were recovered from nine shovel tests, and in Shovel Tests 5 and L8-1, to
depths of 1.0 m below modern ground surface. In no instances were numerous artifacts recovered
from any single level within a shovel tests, but chipped stone debris is present throughout the
profile in all parts of the site area. The 37 artifacts collected were identified as 8 core reduction
flakes, 11 biface thinning flakes, 4 pieces of shatter, 13 indeterminate flake fragments, and a
single edge-modified split cobble. This informal tool, recovered from 20-cm depth in Shovel
Test 6, is approximately one-quarter of a cobble whose abrupt edge was modified to create a
steep end scraper.
Shovel Test 7 was excavated approximately 20 cm upslope of Feature 1. The fire-cracked rock
fragments that comprise Feature 1 are spread out across a 2-x-2-m area and are thus eroding
somewhat down the slope of the ridge in this area. However, no further fragments of fire-cracked
rock were encountered in the shovel test, and no artifacts were noted.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP940 is a surface chipped stone scatter with a fire-cracked rock feature that is
accompanied by at least one meter of apparently intact subsurface deposits, and a good potential
for buried features. There is minimal disturbance to the site, with erosion being evident along the
perimeter of the landform where artifacts and fire-cracked rock fragments are visible. The single
feature is eroding at the north end of the site. This site has good potential for intact subsurface
deposits, based on the extent and nature of the subsurface deposits as indicated by shovel testing
and the eroding landform edge. As no features or diagnostic artifacts were identified in the
shovel tests however, additional subsurface testing should be conducted to determine the degree
of contextual integrity and whether the site will yield data important to addressing regional
research questions. As a result, site 41ZP940 is recommended as of unknown eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP941
This site is on the lower slopes of a gravel-strewn hill and the adjacent terrace overlooking, to the
northwest, the confluence of Las Palomas Creek with Arroyo Burro (see Figure 6); its eastern
boundary is defined by a small drainage. The site is multicomponent, with a light scatter of
chipped stone debitage and formal tools, and historic-era house and chimney foundations
accompanied by a large array of refuse. The site extends east-west along the sandy terrace,
encompassing an area of 15,638 m2, and measuring 194 m east-west by 103 m north-south
(Figure 27; see site and feature sketch maps accompanying site form in Appendix 1). The
boundary is based on the distribution of artifacts across the surface of the site.
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2005, apparently lies partly outside properties
under the jurisdiction of the USIBWC. Property markers were not found in this immediate area,
and it was not until data were processed in the lab that GMI was made aware of this site being
partly investigated outside the project boundary.
Vegetation in the site area is moderate, providing ground surface visibility of approximately 90
percent. Scattered mesquite, prickly pear, and short grasses are present across the site. A hunting
stand and feeder are located immediately east of the site, and stones from the chimney foundation
have been used to create a recent fire pit.

Surface Investigations
Artifacts from the prehistoric component are present in relatively low densities, reaching a
maximum of approximately three to five artifacts per square meter. Approximately 80 artifacts
were noted, including lithic debitage and formal tools. None of the formal tools was diagnostic,
and no prehistoric artifacts were collected from the surface.
The historic-era component consists of a collapsed wooden structure, with an apparent stone slab
foundation, and an 8-ft-tall partly collapsed chimney at its south end. Most of the historic
debrisâwood boards, hinges, a button, sheet metal, a ceramic doorknob fragment, a broken
porcelain bowl, and a glass bottle and jarâis located immediately around these collapsed
elements. These items are largely clustered in a 16-x-12-m area at the base of the slope on the
east end of the site. None of the historic items were collected.

Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated on this site (Table 22; see Figure 27). The tests were situated in
an approximate east-west alignment along the edge of the terrace intended to parallel the project
area boundary. The structural remains lay north of this boundary. All six shovel tests were
positive for subsurface cultural materials, and all were excavated to at least 80-cm depth.

Sediments were generally uniform from top to bottom of the stratigraphic sequence, and artifacts
from depths to 1 m suggest the possibility of deep cultural deposits along this terrace edge. Two
fragments of likely recent clear glass were recovered from the top 20 cm in Shovel Test 1, but
otherwise, all recovered artifacts from subsurface deposits were chipped stone debitage. Though
no fire-cracked rock fragments other than those resulting from recent use of the chimney stones
for a fire pit were noted on the surface of the site or in the subsurface deposits, a charcoal stain
with charcoal and burned clay was noted from 60â100-cm in depth in Shovel Test 3; chipped
stone debitage was found in association. A distinct feature could not be defined from this layer,
but its presence is certainly suggestive of the possibility of significant buried deposits along this
terrace. Artifacts recovered from the subsurface deposits include biface thinning flakes, core
reduction flakes, shatter, and flake fragments.
106

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP941 is a multicomponent site with a collapsed historic-era structure and associated
refuse and a prehistoric chipped stone scatter with a possibility for buried features and deposits.
The historic component, consisting of a collapsed wooden structure and partly standing stone
chimney with associated refuse, is relatively intact. Few artifacts were found to suggest an age
for the historic use of the site. Archival research related to this property is recommended before
an eligibility recommendation regarding the historic component can be made. Therefore, the
historic component of site 41ZP941 is recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP. The prehistoric component, consisting of the surface lithic scatter and a possibility for
relatively deeply buried features and artifacts, also appears to be in good condition. A burned
layer was noted between 80 and 100 cm in depth, and artifacts were found buried to at least the
same depth. Further testing of these deposits, though, are needed to establish whether this site
retains contextual integrity and provides data important to an understanding of the prehistory of
the region. Therefore, it is recommended that the prehistoric component of site 41ZP941 is of
unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP942
Site 41ZP942 is on a relatively level toe slope of a gravel-strewn hill and adjacent terrace
overlooking the confluence of a northward-trending tributary drainage with Arroyo Burro (see
Figure 6). It is a lithic materials procurement and reduction site, consisting of a relatively light
scatter of chipped stone debitage, cores and tested cobbles, and formal tools in various stages of
manufacture. Based on the surface distribution of chipped stone artifacts, the site has an area of
13,808 m2 and measures 153 m north-south by 142 m east-west (Figure 28).
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2005, apparently lies partly outside properties
under the jurisdiction of the USIBWC. Property markers were not found in this immediate area,
and it was not until data were processed in the lab that GMI was made aware of this site being
partly investigated outside the project boundary.
Vegetation in the site area is light to moderate, providing ground surface visibility of
approximately 75 percent. Scattered mesquite, prickly pear, and short grasses are present across
the site. A pipeline was being constructed through the southwestern part of the site at the time it
was recorded; the newly churned sediments from this construction allowed GMI archaeologists to
see some of the subsurface deposits.

Surface Investigations
Artifacts are present in relatively low to moderate densities, reaching a maximum of
approximately 7 to 10 artifacts per square meter, particularly along the more eastern part of the
site where erosion has left a deflated area adjacent to the side drainage. Approximately 60
artifacts were noted, including cores and tested cobbles, lithic debitage and formal tools.

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Eight bifacially modified formal tools were collected from the surface of the site. One is a thick,
early-stage biface, five are middle-stage biface fragments, and two are late-stage bifaces, of
which one is complete and the other fragmentary. The complete biface is thin, with serrated
lateral edges and a thinned base. All are made of chert, of various types, textures, and qualities.

Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated on this site (Table 23; see Figure 28). The shovel tests were
located in the areas of the site with the least evidence for recent disturbances, either from the
pipeline or from the erosion and deflation in the southeastern part of the site. Five on the six
shovel tests were positive for subsurface cultural materials, though the depth of deposits tended
not to be deep; just three tests were excavated beyond 50-cm depth. Shovel tests were terminated
at highly compacted or caliche-laden sediments, or weathered bedrock deposits.

A fire-cracked rock fragment was noted in the top 20 cm in Shovel Test 3, though no fire-cracked
rock was visible on the surface of the site. Two pieces of chipped stone debitage was recovered
from between 40 and 60 cm depth in Shovel Test 3, though most artifacts were confined to the
top 35 cm of sediments. Artifacts recovered from the shovel tests include biface thinning flakes
and core reduction flakes.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP942 is a chipped stone artifact scatter of low to moderate density with a relatively
minimal subsurface extent. Artifacts consist of those resulting from both tool manufacturing and
core reduction, but they are in only moderate densities. Only a single possibly identifiable form
was noted, though several formal tools were noted. Given the limited nature of the assemblage
and the equally limited subsurface extent to the deposits, site 41ZP942 is recommended as not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP943
Site 41ZP943 is on a slightly sloping, eroded and dissected terrace overlooking the confluence of
a small drainage with Arroyo Burro (see Figure 6). On the opposite side of this northwardtrending drainage, at a distance of approximately 90 m, lies site 41ZP942. Site 41ZP943 is a
lithic materials reduction site, consisting of a relatively low density scatter of chipped stone
debitage and formal tools in various stages of manufacture. It is also a probable campsite, as
fragments of fire-cracked rock were noted in the eroded areas, particularly within the drainage on
the north side of the site. Based on the surface distribution of chipped stone artifacts, the site has
an area of 22,840 m2 and measures 267 m east-west by 138 m north-south (Figure 29).
The landscape is heavily dissected, and the vegetation is fairly sparse, providing ground surface
visibility of 75 percent. Scattered mesquite and huisache dominate the vegetation in the site area;
grasses are very sparse. Beyond the gullying of the northeastern part of the site, a two-track road,
running roughly east-west, extends through the approximate site center.
Surface Investigations
Artifacts are present in relatively low to moderate densities across the siteâs surface, with the
exception of within the gullied area to the northeast where densities are in the range of 7 to 10
artifacts per square meter. Approximately 90 artifacts were noted, including cores, lithic
debitage, and formal tools in various stages of manufacture. Seven bifaces were collected from
the surface of the site.
The collected tools include one late-, four middle-, and two early-stage bifaces. None are
diagnostic forms or fragments, and all are of chert.
Subsurface Investigations
Seven shovel tests were excavated in efforts to delineate the site boundary (Table 24; see Figure
29). The shovel tests were located in the areas of the site with the least evidence for erosion.
Five of the seven shovel tests were positive for subsurface cultural materials, with only tests 3
and 7 proving negative for cultural deposits. Six of the tests were excavated to 60-cm depth
before encountering extremely compacted sediments with very high quantities of CaCO3
inclusions. Shovel Test 4, along the western edge of the site was excavated to 35-cm depth
through extremely compacted sediments that began just below the ground surface, though a very
high quantity of artifacts was recovered from these 35-cm.

Artifacts recovered from the shovel tests include a single, small, thick biface (from Shovel Test 1)
and debitage, including 11 biface thinning flakes and a single core reduction flake. Nearly equal
densities were also found in Shovel Test 2 and Shovel Test 4, and all artifacts were confined to
the top 40 cm of deposits.
Though no fire-cracked rock fragments or other evidence of fire-cracked rock features were
encountered in the shovel tests, the abundant quantities of fragments exposed in the dissected
areas indicate a relatively good potential for intact buried features in the less eroded portions of
the site.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP943 is a lithic materials procurement and processing site with a probable open campsite
component. Both core reduction and tool manufacturing activities are represented, in moderate
densities. The site is heavily eroded, though, and many of the artifacts were noted in deflated and
112

Chapter 5: Survey Results

eroded areas. A high density of artifacts and burned rock in a deflated area of the site, though, is
suggestive of possibly deep subsurface deposits. Shovel tests, however, could not be excavated
below 60-cm depth. While artifacts are confined to the top 40 cm of deposits, there is good
potential for buried features within that layer. It is recommended that further test excavations are
necessary to determine the data potential of site. Site 41ZP943 is therefore recommended as of
unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP944
Site 41ZP944 is on an eroded and disturbed, low-rising terrace above Las Palomas Creek to the
north of Arroyo Burro (see Figure 6). It is a relatively sparse lithic scatter, consisting of a light
scatter of chipped stone debitage, with no formal tools, cores, tested cobbles, or fire-cracked rock
visible on the modern ground surface. The site has an area of 4,284 m2, measuring 99 m parallel
to the creek by 60 m southwest-northeast (Figure 30).
The vicinity of the site is heavily disturbed, with a two-track road, stock tank, and earthen dam
near the eastern boundary. The vegetation is relatively sparse, consisting of mesquite, prickly
pear, and native grasses. Surface visibility was estimated to be 80 percent. A corral and chute
are also located within the site boundary at the north end, and pushpiles are present between the
two-track road and the earthen dam forming the edge of the stock tank.

Surface Investigations
Artifacts are present in relatively low densities across the siteâs surface, with a range of just one
to two artifacts per square meter, at most. Approximately 50 artifacts were noted, consisting
entirely of chipped stone debitage. Debitage is primarily secondary reduction debris. No formal
tool forms were noted, and no artifacts were collected from the surface of the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated in efforts to delineate the site boundary (Table 25; see Figure 30).
The shovel tests were located in the areas of the site with the least evidence for disturbance,
though Shovel Test 4 was placed between the two-track road and the stock tank. Four of the six
shovel tests were terminated at 40-cm depth or less, upon encountering clay or weathered
bedrock. Shovel Tests 3, 4, 5, and 6 were positive for cultural materials. In Shovel Test 3 and 6,
cultural deposits were confined to the top 40 cm of deposits, whereas in Shovel Test 5, firecracked rock fragments and lithic debitage were recovered from between 40 and 50 cm depth.
Artifacts recovered from the subsurface deposits consist of core reduction and biface thinning
flakes, tested cobbles, and shatter. Fire-cracked chert and fire-cracked sandstone were both
identified from Shovel Test 5, from which most of the artifacts were recovered.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP944 is a low-density core reduction and tool manufacturing site with limited potential
for intact deposits. It lies on an extensively disturbed and eroding terrace; a berm, stock tank, and
two-track road all cut through the site. The potential for additional subsurface deposits is
considered relatively low, given the active erosion across the site. There is also a low density of
artifacts across the siteâs surface, and an equally low density of artifacts encountered in the shovel
tests. Deposits are relatively shallow and spotty across the site. Site 41ZP944 is therefore
recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Site 41ZP931
Site 41ZP931 is a campsite and lithic procurement locale along the lower flanks of a graveltopped hill overlooking, to the southeast, the confluence of Las Palomas Creek and Arroyo Burro
(see Figure 6). It was documented in 2006. Gravel exposures, from which lithic raw materials
were obtained, are plentiful along the northern edges of this large site, while deeper sediments
with buried deposits are present along the southern parts.
The site encompasses an approximately 30,348 m2 area, measuring 277 m north-south by 213 m
east-west in minimum dimensions (Figure 31). To the northwest, the site abuts the boundary of
the project area. GMI investigations extended partly outside this boundary due to uncertainties of

the purpose of various fence lines present in this area, and thus the site is known to extend at least
somewhat beyond the project boundary. The site appears to follow the landform as it separates
the Las Palomas drainage from that of Arroyo Burro, with the only question on the siteâs extent
being how far upslope related chipped stone debitage may be found.
Vegetation in the site area is relatively sparse, providing ground surface visibility in the range of
85 percent, except along the graveled slopes where visibility is even greater. On the lower,
terrace surface, sparse mesquite, acacia, huisache, prickly pear, and some grasses are present in
the site vicinity. Disturbances on this site area are primarily in the form of a criss-crossing mass
of two-track roads and an old stock pond to the east of the siteâs boundary.

Surface Investigations
Hundreds of chipped stone artifacts are visible across the surface of this site. Unmodified gravels
are particularly evident on the sloping surface of the northwestern part of the site, and thus the
density of tested cobbles, cores, and flaked-stone debitage is greatest in this area. Cores and
tested cobbles become far less common farther to the south in the more level part of the site, and
the presence of formal tools in various stages of manufacture becomes more evident. All artifacts
noted were of various types and textures of chert. No finished projectile forms were noted on the
surface of the site. Five other bifacially modified tools were specifically noted and mapped from
the surface (see Figure 31). These consisted of three late-stage, thin bifaces, and two late-stage,
thick bifaces. No artifacts were collected from the surface of the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated within the boundary of this site (Table 26; see Figure 31). Two,
BL2 and BL3, were excavated during the systematic transect survey through the area. A single,
relatively large core reduction flake was recovered from 40-cm depth in Shovel Test BL2,
excavated near the south edge of the site. BL3, located approximately 220 m north along the
same transect, was excavated in a moderate probability area along a slightly sloping surface on
which a few artifacts lay nearby. It was negative for buried cultural material. As these two tests
were excavated to 80 and 60 cm depth, respectively, and there was observed an abundance of
lithic debris, cores, and tools on the surface, four other tests were scattered across the site area, as
determined by the distribution of artifacts, to check for the presence of intact subsurface deposits.
Only two of the remaining shovel tests, MC10 and BL14, were positive for subsurface cultural
materials. Both were in the eastern half of the site, though separated horizontally by a distance of
over 80 m. A single chert biface thinning flake was recovered from 30-cm depth in MC10. Eight
artifacts were recovered from subsurface deposits in BL14, from between the ground surface and
80-cm depth. These consist of a single biface thinning flake and six indeterminate flake
fragments.

Site Summary and Recommendations
This extensive chipped stone procurement and tool manufacturing site lies on the lower slopes of
a gravel-topped hill and the accompanying high terrace below it. There is a high density of
artifacts across the surface of the site, representing all stages of core reduction and formal tool
production activities. Surface artifacts include many formal tools, but these were horizontally
spread across the full extent of the site and the landform. Shovel tests revealed some depth to the
cultural materials, but quantities are relatively low and scattered vertically throughout the
stratigraphic sequence. Given its scattered nature, site 41ZP931 is recommended as not eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP.

118

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Site 41ZP932
Site 41ZP932 is a probable campsite with associated chipped stone procurement and initial
reduction activities located just southwest of site 41ZP931 across a small drainage (see Figure 6).
Gravel exposures from which lithic raw materials were obtained are plentiful along the northern
edges of this large site, and deeper sediments with buried deposits are present along the southern
parts. The site encompasses an approximately 31,570 m2 area, measuring 360 m north-south by
220 m east-west in minimum dimension (Figure 32).
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2006, apparently lies partly outside properties
under the jurisdiction of the USIBWC. Property markers were not found in this immediate area,
and it was not until data were processed in the lab that GMI was made aware of this site being
partly investigated outside the project boundary.
Vegetation in the site area is relatively sparse, providing ground surface visibility in the range of
75 percent, except along the graveled slopes, where visibility is even greater. On the lower,
flatter terrace surface, sparse mesquite, acacia, huisache, and prickly pear are scattered. Grasses
grow relatively densely throughout the area. Disturbances on this site area consist of four twotrack roads and a deer blind along one of them.

Surface Investigations
Chipped stone artifacts are relatively sparsely scattered all across the surface of this landform.
The site was first noted during transect survey, when surface artifacts and possible deep
sediments were encountered.
Hundreds of chipped stone artifacts of debitage, cores, and tested cobbles were noted across the
site surface. Chert gravels are particularly abundant toward the north end of the site, where
greater quantities of cores, tested cobbles, and primary reduction debris are evident. Finer, laterstage debris is more evident away from the gravelly slope, where the surface again flattens
somewhat. A single informal tool, a core modified to create a steep working edge, was mapped
toward the northwest part of the site (see Figure 32). No formal tools were noted on the site, and
no artifacts were collected from the surface of the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Shovel Tests MC3, BL4, and BL8 were all excavated, as random shovel tests while walking
transects, in areas thought to have a high probability for buried deposits, 50â150 m apart from
one another (Table 27; see Figure 32). BL4 and BL8 were both very shallow, with one
terminated at 30-cm depth when a gravel layer was encountered, and the other terminated at 20cm depth when extremely compacted silty clay deposits were encountered. Shovel Test MC3,
while negative for cultural deposits, did demonstrate the depth of soil deposits in the area, being
excavated to 1.0-m depth without encountering either compacted sediments or gravels.

While recording the site, four additional tests were excavated: VF1, VF2, MC14, and MC15 (see
Figure 32). VF2, located along the northwestern boundary of the site, was negative for cultural
materials and quite shallow, excavated only to 45-cm depth before extremely compacted silty
clay sediments were encountered. VF1, terminated at 35-cm due to encountering extremely
compacted silty clay sediments, was also negative. It was located near the southeast boundary of
the site.

121

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Shovel Tests MC14 and MC15 both had cultural materials throughout, to 1-m depth. They were
located in the southcentral to southwestern parts of the site (see Figure 32). In MC14, mussel
shell, charcoal, chipped stone, and fire-cracked sandstone were all noted in depths of just below
the modern ground surface to 1 m. Recent, white-glazed ceramic fragments were recovered from
the top 20 cm. Below the sherds, 16 chipped stone artifacts were recovered, consisting of: seven
biface thinning flakes, two core reduction flakes, one piece of shatter, two indeterminate flake
fragments, and a single core. Approximately 38 g of mussel shell were noted in all levels from
the top to 1-m depth. Fire-cracked rocks were also noted in all levels from the surface to 1-m
depth.
In MC15, chipped stone artifacts were recovered from 0â100 cm in depth. The sediments did not
change in color, texture, or inclusions between what was encountered immediately below the
ground surface and that encountered at 1-m depth. The artifacts were thus separated into just two
groups: those from the top 20 cm (consisting of two core reduction flakes), and those from the
lower 70 cm (consisting of a core fragment, two core reduction flakes, one biface thinning flake,
and two indeterminate flake fragments).

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP932 is an horizontally extensive, chipped stone, materials procurement site. Only
primary reduction activities appear to have occurred at the site, as no formal tools were noted and
most debris identified is associated with primary core reduction. There are subsurface deposits in
association with the surface scatter, and they extend up to 1 m in depth. They are, however, fairly
restricted in their horizontal extent, having been identified in just two of the shovel tests.
Nonetheless, the potential exists for intact buried features in the area, as the deposits extended to
at least 1-m depth and included fire-cracked rock fragments. It is recommended that additional
test excavations be conducted to determine the data potential of the site in relation to regional
research issues. Therefore, site 41ZP932 is recommended as being of unknown eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP933
Site 41ZP933, located on the next lower landform below site 41ZP932 and directly overlooking
Arroyo Burro, was recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2006 (see Figure 6). It is an apparent
campsite with some accompanying artifacts. No gravel exposures are evident in the area, few
artifacts are visible on the modern ground surface, and the only noted component was buried.
The site encompasses an approximately 2,338 m2 area, measuring 103 m northeast-southwest by
32 m northwest-southeast in maximum dimensions (Figure 33).
The site parallels the edge of a terrace landform, extending approximately 32 m perpendicular to
the edge. It was first noted through the excavation of Shovel Test MC4 while walking transects
through the area; this shovel test was excavated in a high-probability area, and though no artifacts
were recovered, charcoal and ash were noted in the south wall of the test pit. The site is
completely restricted to the landform, but apparently does not extend completely across the
landform.

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Vegetation in the site area is dense, but consists primarily of grasses that permit ground visibility
of 60 percent. Sparse mesquite, acacia, and prickly pear are scattered along the surface. A twotrack road runs through the northwest part of the site and a single cow path runs north from the
terrace edge to the road, allowing good visibility in those areas.
Surface Investigations
Almost no artifacts were noted on the surface of this level, sandy landform. One piece of chert
chipped stone debitageâa small core reduction flakeâwas mapped along the two-track road
toward the northwest edge of the site. Two other chert flake fragments were noted on the surface
along the cow path. No other artifacts were observed, and no artifacts were collected from the
surface of the site.
Subsurface Investigations
With few surface artifacts by which to define the site boundary, 16 shovel tests were excavated
on the site and in its vicinity to understand the horizontal and vertical extent of the cultural
deposits (Table 28). Shovel Tests BL7, MC16, and MC25 were excavated between sites
41ZP932 and 41ZP933 while attempting to define the boundaries of the two sites; a shallow
drainage runs through this area and, in fact, largely defines the boundaries of the sites. Shovel
Test MC21 was excavated immediately south of what later was defined as the site 41ZP933
boundary, and MC18 and BL9 were excavated to the west, all helping to define the siteâs extent
in those directions. These six tests, all negative, helped identify the site boundary and ultimately
were defined as lying outside the site. All were later defined as nonsite shovel tests and
summarized later in the chapter under NUA Nonsite Shovel Tests.
Eleven shovel tests were excavated within the boundary of the site (see Table 28 and Figure 33).
Artifacts were recovered from five of these and came from just below the modern ground surface
to 80-cm depth. Charcoal, ash, and a small amount of fire-cracked rock were found in eight of
the shovel tests, at depths ranging from just below the ground surface to 85 cm below the modern
ground surface.
Twenty chert, chipped stone artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests. These include eight
core reduction flakes, two biface thinning flakes, a rejuvenation flake, seven indeterminate flake
fragments, and two pieces of shatter. Relatively few of these artifacts, given the charcoal, ash,
and fire-cracked rock in the surrounding matrix in the shovel tests, have evidence of exposure to
heat. Three artifacts are discolored and two are pot-lidded.
One of the charcoal and ash occurrences, in Shovel Test MC4, was particularly obvious and
appeared to be restricted in its vertical extent. The original approximately 30-x-30-cm shovel test
was expanded to 50 cm wide in order to further expose the charcoal and ash, and a profile was
drawn and photographs taken (Figure 34). This occurrence does appear to have the morphology
of a buried hearth. Fragments of a single fire-cracked chert cobble were recovered from this
same level, though a direct association between the cobble and the charcoal lens was not
established. The cobble was broken into about a dozen pieces, and flake scars were not evident
on the fractured chunks; the cobble may have been a core, but definitive evidence has been
obscured by the fracturing. Other shovel tests that exposed buried charcoal, ash, and fire-cracked
rock were not individually expanded, though several profiles were drawn.

Site Summary and Recommendations
There are very few artifacts in association with site 41ZP933, an apparent buried open campsite
on a terrace edge. Only a few artifacts were noted in the area, though far more were noted in
shovel tests. No formal tools were observed. However, there is excellent potential for intact
buried features, given the quantity of charcoal, fire-cracked rock, and even chipped stone noted in
shovel tests. It is recommended that additional test excavations be conducted at site 41ZP933 to
126

Chapter 5: Survey Results

determine the degree of contextual integrity present and the potential for data important for an
understanding of the prehistory of the region. Site 41ZP933 is therefore recommended as being
of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP934
Site 41ZP934 is on the lower flanks of a hill overlooking Arroyo Burro immediately to the south
(see Figure 6). It is an apparent campsite with an accompanying surface scatter of lithic artifacts.
The site encompasses an approximately 3,172 m2 area, measuring 69 m north-south by 72 m eastwest in maximum dimensions (Figure 35). The site appears to be located entirely on the lower
parts of this landform, from the south edge overlooking the drainage, to a point approximately 67
m north of and perpendicular to the edge.
The site was first identified on the basis of chipped stone debitage noted on the surface during
transect survey. At that time, as the area was a high-probability area, Shovel Test MC5 was
excavated into this sandy landform, and chipped stone artifacts and fire-cracked rock fragments
were noted in the subsurface deposits to a depth of 1 m.
Vegetation in the site area is sparse, consisting primarily of grasses and a few scattered prickly
pear. Ground visibility is estimated to be 75 percent. Gravel exposures are evident in the area,
particularly to the north, as the ground surface slopes upward toward the hill. A two-track road
runs roughly north-south through the western part of the site, and this is the most obvious
disturbance to it.

Surface Investigations
The site consists of a generally sparse scatter of chipped stone artifacts across the surface. In the
densest of areas, 2 to 4 pieces of chipped stone may be seen per square meter. Upslope toward
the hill, this density decreases markedly, as does the presence of chert gravels.
The mapped lithic tool is the proximal fragment of a thin, rounded biface made of brownish-gray
chalcedonic chert. No other lithic tools were noted, and no artifacts were collected from the
surface of the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated within the boundary of this site (Table 29; see Figure 35). Shovel
Tests BL23 and BL25, both ultimately defined as NUA nonsite Shovel Tests, were used to help
delineate the site boundary. BL23 was located 24 m to the east and BL25 was located 17 m to the
north of the site boundary.

Artifacts were recovered from all six of the shovel tests, ranging from just below the modern
ground surface to 100-cm depth (see Table 29). Fire-cracked rock was noted in four of the shovel
tests, at depths ranging from 40 to 100 cm below the surface. Thirty-nine chipped stone artifacts
were recovered from subsurface contexts. Eleven of these were recovered from MC5 and 12
from MC26; the remainder was scattered among the other four shovel tests.
In MC26, located toward the central part of the site (see Figure 35), the 12 artifacts, consisting of
six biface thinning flakes, a piece of shatter, and five indeterminate flake fragments. were
recovered from the same 20-cm level (40â60 cm below ground surface) in which a concentration
of fire-cracked rock was also noted. This fire-cracked rock concentration, noted only in the
129

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

excavation of the shovel test pit, may have been an intact buried feature. Fire-cracked rock was
noted within the same strata as chipped stone artifacts in two other shovel tests: BL24 and MC27,
both also located in the central part of the site.
MC5 was located toward the southwestern site boundary, and artifacts were recovered from 30â
100 cm below the modern ground surface. A single biface was recovered from 10 cm below
ground surface in BL22, toward the southeastern site boundary. This is a proximal fragment of a
thin, late-stage biface, and may be the basal portion of a Kinney dart point, dated to the Middle
Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1999:137).

Site Summary and Recommendations
There is a low to moderate density of artifacts across the surface of site 41ZP934, a lithic raw
materials procurement and processing site with an apparent buried open campsite component.
Only a single formal tool was noted on the surface, and a second was recovered in the subsurface
deposits. There is also a buried component to the site that consists of lithic debitage and firecracked rock. The site has a good potential for intact buried features, given the fire-cracked rock
fragments noted in two of the shovel tests, though no charcoal was found in association with
either occurrence. It is recommended that additional test excavations be conducted at site
41ZP934 to determine the degree of contextual integrity present and the potential for data
important for an understanding of the prehistory of the region. Site 41ZP934 is, therefore,
recommended as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP929
Site 41ZP929, a small chipped stone procurement locale, is on a small terrace on the west side of
a southward-trending tributary of Arroyo Burro (see Figure 6). It is almost directly across this
tributary from the much larger, previously recorded site 41ZP811. The site encompasses an
approximately 2,805-m2 area, measuring 51 m north-south by 69 m east-west in maximum
dimensions (Figure 36). The site area nearly encompasses the landform; in addition to the
tributary, located to the east, smaller drainages define the northern and southern boundary of the
site. A fourth drainage is located to the west, but an artificial berm built along the western edge
of the terrace immediately above the drainage, has damaged the western part of the site, and the
western site boundary, therefore, lies just east of this berm.
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2006, partly overlaps a western boundary of the
project area. Property markers were not found in this immediate area, and it was not until data
were processed in the lab that GMI was made aware of this site being investigated in part outside
the project boundary. The site was first identified on the basis of chipped stone debitage noted on
the surface during transect survey. Because the area was a high-probability area, the surface of
the site was examined, and once the presence of a site established, shovel testing commenced.
Vegetation in the site area is moderate, consisting primarily of grasses, huisache, mesquite, and
prickly pear. Ground visibility is estimated to be 75 percent. A berm, most likely artificial and
not of recent construction, extends north-south along the western edge of the site, just above the
small drainage otherwise defining the landform.

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Surface Investigations
Approximately 75 artifacts are visible on the modern ground surface of this small terrace. These
consist almost entirely of early-stage cobble reduction debris. Cores, tested cobbles, and primary
and secondary flakes are the most frequent artifacts noted. Few biface thinning or other interior
flakes, and no bifaces or other formal and informal tools were noted on the surface of the site.
The boundary of the site was largely defined on the basis of the surface distribution of artifacts,
and the northern, southern, and eastern edges of the landform. No artifacts were collected from
the surface of the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated across the landform to assist in defining the boundary of the site
(Table 30; see Figure 36). The shovel tests were all terminated at shallow depths, when either
extremely compacted clay or a gravel lens was encountered. Two shovel tests were excavated to
just 10 cm below the ground surface, one excavated to 15-cm, one to 20 cm, one to 30 cm, and
one to 55-cm depth below the modern ground surface. No fire-cracked rock was noted in any of
the excavations.

Chipped stone artifacts were recovered from two of the shovel tests: MC29 and BL28 (see Table
30), both located in the northern half or so of the site. In MC29, an edge-modified flake was
recovered from 2-cm below the modern ground surface. It is a secondary whole flake of waxy
dark tan chert of which one lateral edge has been pressure flaked to create a 2.14 cm, low-angle
working edge. A single flake fragment was recovered from approximately 5-cm below the
modern ground surface in shovel test BL28.

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP929 is a low-density scatter of chipped stone artifacts representing early to middle
stages of core reduction activities. No formal tools were evident and no diagnostic forms were
noted. Subsurface, the artifacts are also of low density and shallow extent. This site is
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP930
This buried campsite with accompanying chipped stone scatter is located on a restricted terrace
landform overlooking the confluence of an unnamed southward-trending tributary drainage with
Arroyo Burro (see Figure 6). It is approximately 150 m south of site 41ZP929, and southwest
across the tributary drainage from 41ZP811.
The site covers an approximately 3,659-m2 area, measuring 118 m northeast-southwest by 43 m
southeast-northwest in maximum dimensions (Figure 37). The site area nearly encompasses the
terrace landform on which it lies.
Site 41ZP930 was first identified on the basis of a few pieces of chipped stone debitage and two
formal tools noted on the surface during transect survey. Because the area was a high-probability
area, the surface of the site was examined, and though only a few chipped stone artifacts were
noted, shovel testing was conducted.
Vegetation in the site area is moderate, with sparse ground cover to the north and northwest at the
base of the hill, and dense ground cover of grasses, huisache, mesquite, and acacia closer to the
two drainages. Ground visibility is estimated to be 70 percent. Disturbances to the site are only
those involving trash disposal at the base of the hill forming the northwest site boundary.

Surface Investigations
Approximately 15 surface artifacts were ultimately identified across the site area. Primary,
secondary, and tertiary chipped stone debris were all noted. No cores or tested cobbles were
identified. Two bifacially modified tool, lying adjacent to one another, s were also identified (see
Figure 37). One is a thick, early-stage biface made of speckled brown chert. The other is a
medial fragment of a thin, late-stage biface, or projectile point, made of tan chert. No other
formal tools were noted. The boundary of the site could not be established on the basis of the
meager surface scatter of artifacts. No artifacts were collected from the surface of the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Ultimately, seven shovel tests were excavated on the terrace landform to identify the siteâs
horizontal and vertical extents (Table 31; see Figure 37). Shovel Test BL31 fell just outside the
defined site boundary, along the northwest edge at the base of the hill. It was a shallow test,
excavated to just 25 cm before encountering a compact gravel lens. Chipped stone artifacts were

recovered from three of the six shovel tests excavated to define the site boundary. Fire-cracked
rock fragments were recovered from four shovel tests as well. In all, cultural materials were
identified from four shovel tests.
Four artifacts were collected from BL29, located near the center of the site. From the top 10 cm,
a biface thinning flake, a core reduction flake, and an indeterminate flake fragment were all
identified. An informal tool, consisting of a flake that was edge-modified along the obverse distal
end to create a steep-ended scraper, was collected from 35-cm depth. An additional four artifacts
were recovered from 20â80 cm depth in Shovel Test MC34 (see Table 31). Debitage consists of

an indeterminate flake fragment, a core reduction flake, and a single piece of shatter. An
informal tool, in the form of another edge-modified flake, was also recovered from between 60â
80 cm-depth below the modern ground surface. Two edges of the flake are modified: one to
create a concave working edge and another to create a steep-end scraper. A single indeterminate
flake fragment was recovered from 40â60-cm depth in BL32.
Fire-cracked rock fragments were noted in Shovel Tests BL32, MC33, and MC34. These
fragments were all noted from 40â80 cm below the modern ground surface and, along with the
artifacts, indicate the presence of a buried component at the site that may be relatively intact.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP930 is a probable buried open camp site on the north side of Arroyo Burro. It is
accompanied by a low-density surface scatter of artifacts, consisting almost entirely of secondary
chipped stone core reduction debris and tool manufacturing debris. Two formal and two informal
tools were also noted.
Subsurface testing along this terrace indicates, however, that there is a high probability of buried
features. Fire-cracked rock was noted in three separate shovel tests at depths greater than 40 cm
below the modern ground surface. Artifacts were noted at equal and lesser depths. It is
recommended that additional test excavations be conducted at site 41ZP930 to determine the
degree of contextual integrity present and the potential for data important for an understanding of
the prehistory of the region. Site 41ZP930 is, therefore, recommended as being of unknown
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

NUA Nonsite Shovel Tests
Thirty- seven shovel tests were located outside the boundaries of archaeological sites in the NUA
(Figure 38). Twelve of these nonsite tests were specifically placed to help define boundaries of
sites during the recording phase of work (Table 32), and thus all were negative for subsurface
cultural deposits. These tests are mentioned in earlier site discussions as tests used for boundary
delineations, because they were used to help define the horizontal and vertical extent of sites, but
their details are provided in Table 33.
The remaining 25 nonsite shovel tests were placed in high- and moderate-probability areas in
order to search for cultural deposits (Table 33; see Figure 38). Not all of the nonsite shovel tests
were negative for buried cultural deposits. Artifacts were recovered from two of the tests. These
tests were placed at the bottom of hillslopes, though neither is particularly close to new or
previously recorded archaeological sites. A single indeterminate flake fragment was recovered
from the top 20 cm in NS J1. From the other shovel test, RST L1, a core flake and a fire-cracked
rock fragment were identified from the top 20 cm, while a core flake, three flake fragments, and a
fragment of fire-cracked rock were all recovered between 40 and 100-cm depth.

Several of the shovel tests did show that there is considerable depth to deposits in these moderate
and, primarily, high-probability areas. Thus, the fact that the tests are negative does not
necessarily indicate a complete lack of cultural deposits in the area; as stated in the Scope of
Work, some high-probability areas could have very deep deposits that might not be fully
accessible with just shovel testing. For example, Shovel Test BL5 was abandoned at 95 cm
though good, sandy clay deposits were still present. MC1, MC21, MC38, MC39, and VM2 also
all had continued depth to deposits and were each abandoned for various reasons between 80 and
100 cm in depth. All were negative for cultural inclusions.

CENTRAL UNSURVEYED AREA (CUA)
The project area within the CUA encompasses 216.5 acres along Arroyo CabaseÃ±a and Arroyo
Loma Blanca (Figure 39). In total, 14 archaeological sites were located in this area, of which 12
had been previously recorded and thus their records updated during the present project, and two
newly located and recorded during the 2006 field sessions. All the sites documented during the
present survey have prehistoric components; one (41ZP745) also has a historic component. The
CUA sites are composed of (1) campsites located on terraces just below the bluff edge that marks
the western and northern boundary of the USIBWC 307-ft traverse line; (2) campsites on the
lower edge of uplands; (3) chipped stone procurement sites located on hilltops and slopes with
exposed lag gravel deposits; and (4) sites with elements of mixed terrace, upland, and/or adjacent
hilltop use. Those located on terraces or having elements on terraces frequently have buried
cultural deposits.
Within the CUA, 177 shovel tests were excavated. All high-probability areas were tested, as well
as some areas of moderate probability for having intact, buried cultural deposits. Of these, 123
were located within the bounds of archaeological sites, and 54 were excavated in high- or
moderate-probability areas in order to identify whether subsurface deposits were present in the
area. In the following discussion, each site updated or newly recorded is discussed, followed by a
summary discussion of nonsite shovel tests excavated in the CUA.

Chapter 5: Survey Results

The previously recorded sites in the CUA, like those discussed above for the NUA, were
predominantly originally recorded during the Parsons (2002) reconnaissance survey. During that
survey, approximate site boundaries were defined largely on the basis of surface distributions of
artifacts with little consideration for small gaps between, in particular, surface gravel exposures.
During the present effort, as described below, the ground surface in the vicinity of gravel
exposures was thoroughly examined, often resulting in the combination of several previously
recorded sites into a single, larger one. This was, in fact, an issue of particular concern in the
CUA, as 29 previously recorded sites were combined into just 12 during the present survey. In
addition, there were nine previously recorded sites within the GMI CUA survey parcel that were
not located during the survey. The failure to locate previously recorded sites is likely due to one
or a combination of three factors. First, sites may still be inundated by the reservoir, in spite of
lower water levels. Second, they may have been largely destroyed by the erosion resulting from
previous inundation or other natural and cultural causes. Third, they may have been misplotted
originally, as were several of those sites encompassed by new boundary definitions. These
unlocated sites are also discussed briefly at the end of the CUA section.
Updated Sites
Site 41ZP691
Previous Investigations
Site 41ZP691 was originally recorded during a large pedestrian reconnaissance survey of selected
areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002). It was at that time described as a prehistoric lithic materials
procurement site, with a possible open camp terrace occupation (Parsons 2002:36; Figure 40). It
was mapped as encompassing a surface area of 23,400 m2, measuring 195-x-120 m in size (see
Figure 40). The site was described as having both exposed gravel lenses on the surface and
probable terrace deposits.
Tested and split cobbles, bifacial core fragments, primary reduction debris, and other lithic
artifacts were scattered across the siteâs surface. A concentration of cobbles located at the
extreme northeastern extent of the site was thought to perhaps represent remnants of an
occupational location; no burning or other modifications of these cobbles was mentioned.
Disturbances noted at the site included shoreline and slope erosion, but the site was otherwise
described as being relatively intact (about 95 percent), and the research value was assigned a
moderate ranking.
Present Investigations
This site is on a terrace just below a steeply sloping talus slope, on the east side of Arroyo Loma
Blanca (see Figure 40). The steeply sloping talus slope, most of which lies outside the project
boundary, leads to relatively high bluffs overlooking the arroyo. Vegetation on the site ranges
from very sparse along the northern, likely heavily disturbed area, to moderate along much of
terrace that hugs the base of the talus slope; it consists of grasses, mesquite, huisache, and prickly
pear.

Chapter 5: Survey Results

GMI archaeologists defined the site area considerably differently than it had been previously (see
Figure 40). Based particularly on the extent of the terrace landform and the distribution of
artifacts across it, the site was redefined as encompassing an area of 10,878 m2, measuring 306 m
parallel to the bluff edge (northeast-southwest) and 50 m perpendicular to it. Whereas the
previous plotting of the site had placed it on the steep slope, the terrace, and the adjacent area
distinctly below this landform, GMI redefined the site as existing only on the isolable, relatively
level terrace. Artifacts are visible on the adjacent steep upward-leading slope, but are assumed to
have washed downslope from the upland surface; the property owner adjacent to this area allowed
access to his property, and surface artifacts were observed to be abundant. Likewise, artifacts on
the surface just below the terrace, where several exposed gravel lenses are evident, were defined
as being part of newly recorded site 41ZP925, which is almost adjacent to the northwest.
At the southern terminus of the previously defined site is a two-track road that crosses through the
site, leading from the upland formation toward Arroyo Loma Blanca. North of this two-track
road, and encompassing almost all of the previously defined site boundary, the terrace appears to
have been moderately disturbed. It is cleared of most vegetation, unlike the area to the south of
the road, and a few apparent pushpiles are present along the edge of the talus slope. Just below
the terrace at this northern end are areas that have been subjected to heavy erosion; the sediments
there are discolored and denuded of all vegetation, and channels have cut through the surrounding
deposits. This erosion below the terrace may be related to the apparent disturbances evident atop
the terrace.
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2006, lies partly outside properties under the
jurisdiction of the USIBWC. It was not until data were processed in the lab and better aerial
photographs received that GMI was made aware of this site being partly investigated outside the
project boundary.

Surface Investigations
Hundreds of chipped stone artifacts were noted across the modern ground surface. Thirty-nine
individual items were mapped, all of which were subjected to in-field analysis, and two of which
were collected (see Figure 40). Surface artifacts consist of cores, tested cobbles, primary,
secondary, and tertiary core reduction debris, and biface reduction debris. Edge-modified
debitage and unifacial tools are seemingly concentrated in the northern part, near the previously
defined boundary. More formal tools, such as bifaces, appear to be more abundant in the
southern half, where the terrace hugs the base of the talus slope.
Five cores, a tested cobble, 17 bifaces, 15 modified debitage, a unifacial tool, and two Guadalupe
tools (one uniface, one biface) were all identified among those artifacts on the surface. All
artifacts identified are made of various chert varieties. The bifaces include thick, early-stage
specimens as well as thin, late-stage tools.
Two bifaces were collected from the surface of the site. Both were collected from the base of the
talus slope, near the central part of the site, where the concentration of artifacts is most evident.
One of these is a modified projectile point; it was likely either a Catan or Matamoros point before
being modified. The basal half of the broken projectile was modified to create a steep scraping
edge. The other is the base of a likely Early Triangular dart point. These artifacts indicate a
temporal span from the Early Archaic to possibly the Late Prehistoric periods for this site.

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

The terrace deposits appeared promising for subsurface deposits, and possibly for intact buried
features. No features, though, and no fire-cracked rock fragments, were evident on the surface of
the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Ten shovel tests were excavated across the site (Table 34; see Figure 40); Shovel Tests 1â5 were
clustered within the previous boundary of the site, and the others were more scattered toward the
south along the base of the talus slope. An additional test, W3-7 (excavated in 2005), was located
to the south of the site and was also used in boundary delineation (see discussion of nonsite
shovel tests in the CUA). No artifacts were found among the subsurface deposits. Some charcoal
flecking was observed between 10 and 15 cm in depth in Shovel Test 2, but no fire-cracked rock
or other definitive cultural materials were noted.

The five shovel tests clustered at the north end of the site were excavated in an apparently
disturbed area. Few artifacts were visible on the surface in this area, and only a few small chunks
of charcoal were noted in Shovel Test 2; no other cultural materials were encountered in what
otherwise looked as if it might have substantial and possibly deep subsurface deposits.

144

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Most of the shovel tests were only excavated to shallow depths before encountering quantities of
carbonates, highly compacted sediments, or weathering bedrock deposits. Only Shovel Test 8
was excavated below 40-cm depth.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP691 is a lithic materials reduction and biface production site. Artifacts consist of a
relatively high density of core reduction debris, modified debitage, and bifacially modified tools;
no temporal diagnostics were identified, though one probable stemless dart point had been
reworked into an informal tool. At first appearance, there seemed to be a good possibility of
buried deposits, but this was not borne out by shovel testing. Subsurface sediments are entirely
sterile of cultural material, as demonstrated in the 10 shovel tests across the site. Charcoal was
observed in one shovel test, but it was unaccompanied by definitively cultural deposits. Given
the lack of a subsurface component to the site and the relative dearth of diagnostic tool forms on
the surface, 41ZP691 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP692
Site 41ZP692 has been greatly modified to now include site 41ZP694 within its bounds. The two
sites are first described individually, as they were first recorded, then are combined for a
discussion as they were redefined during the 2006 GMI investigations.

Previous Investigations
Sites 41ZP692 and 41ZP694 were originally recorded during the large pedestrian reconnaissance
survey encompassing selected areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002). Site 41ZP692 was at that time
described as a prehistoric lithic materials procurement site, consisting of a scatter of chipped
stone debitage on a toe slope and terrace remnant with a gravel cap (Parsons 2002:37). It was
mapped as encompassing a surface area of 4,000 m2, measuring 100-x-40 m in size. Artifacts
observed on the site included tested and split cobbles, cores, and primary reduction debris.
Disturbances noted at the site included shoreline and slope erosion, but the site was otherwise
described as being relatively intact (about 90 percent). Nevertheless, the research value was
assigned a low potential due to a low density of artifacts and an absence of features.
Site 41ZP694, also a lithic procurement site, consisted of tested cobbles, flakes, cores, and a thin
arrow point blank (collected; Parsons 2002:39). The approximate site centroid for 41ZP694
placed it 60 m northeast of that of 41ZP692. The site was mapped as having a surface area of
5,950 m2, measuring 70-x-85 m in size. The surface visibility was described as ranging from 50
to 100 percent, and its integrity thought to be 95 percent. It was assigned a moderate research
potential. The two sites lay on the eastern slopes of a slight hill that appears as an island, or nearisland, in the reservoir when water levels are increased.

145

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Present Investigations
GMI archaeologists defined the site area considerably differently than it had been previously
(Figure 41). The newly defined site fills an elevated landform between two small drainagesâone
forming the north boundary and one forming the south boundaryâon a surface below the south
end of the well-defined terrace on which 41ZP691 lies. Not only does the site encompass both
41ZP692 and 41ZP694, as previously defined, but it also includes a considerably greater area
extending, particularly, to the north and the southeast. Based on the extent of the elevated
landform, yet below the well-defined terrace to the east, and the distribution of artifacts across it,
the site was redefined as encompassing a surface area of 50,022 m2, measuring a maximum of
240 m northwest-southeast by 317 m northeast-southwest (see Figure 41). The whole of this
landform is differentiated by exposed gravel lenses just meters apart from one another across its
expanse. Few disturbances were noted across the site; a fence line extends across a part of it in
the northern portion, and a little-used two-track road runs east-west across the near middle of the
site.

Surface Investigations
Hundreds of chipped stone artifacts lay across the surface of the site. They may be found in
relatively concentrated areas, though there is an overall moderate density of artifacts. In the most
concentrated of areas, such as atop the hill marking the western boundary of the site and the
project area, a density of 15 artifacts per m2 is not uncommon. Across most of the remainder of
the site, the density may not reach even one per square meter.
Thirty cores, informal tools, and formal tools in various stages of manufacture were noted and
mapped across the site as a sample of those artifacts present. These included 16 pieces of
modified debitage, two core tools, seven bifacesâincluding both early- and late-stage formsâ
and five cores. While certainly not statistical, this sample is thought to be representative of the
approximate ratio of different types of artifacts present. Much of the debitage from the site is
associated with primary core reduction activities, though the informal and formal tools suggest
other behaviors represented as well. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were noted among these,
and no artifacts were collected from the surface of the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Seven shovel tests were excavated within the defined boundary of the site (Table 35; see Figure
41). An additional eight shovel tests were excavated outside to the boundary of the site in
moderate and high-probability areas, and were used, in part, to help delineate the boundary
(Shovel Tests 3, NS1, NS2, NS3, NS4, NS5, NS6, and NS7; see discussion of nonsite shovel tests
in the CUA). No artifacts were found among the subsurface deposits.
None of the seven tests was excavated to a depth greater than 30 cm below the surface, and no
artifacts were noted among the subsurface sediments. Testing was generally terminated at
compacted clay deposits, bedrock, or caliche-laden sediments.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP692 is a very large lithic raw materials procurement and initial- to late-stage tool
production site. It ranges from having a very low to a very high density of surface artifacts. No
features were noted on the surface. Subsurface deposits are shallow and sterile of all cultural
materials. This site is therefore recommended as being ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Site 41ZP693
Previous Investigations
Site 41ZP693 was originally recorded during the large pedestrian reconnaissance survey
encompassing selected areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002). At that time, the site was described as a
small prehistoric open camp located on a small, dissected upland terrace remnant (Parsons
2002:40). It was mapped as encompassing a surface area of 4,140 m2, measuring 90-x-46 m in
size.
Artifacts observed on the site included tested and split cobbles, cores, primary reduction debris,
and an informal tool. Fire-cracked rock was common across the surface, and some was also
noted as eroding from the edges of a small intermittent drainage running through the site. One
feature, consisting of a well-defined arrangement of fire-cracked sandstone was noted toward the
south end of the site (Feature 1), and two other concentrations of fire-cracked rock were
observed. Disturbances noted at the site included shoreline and slope erosion, but the site was
otherwise described as being relatively intact, with a distinct possibility of buried deposits due to
colluvial and aeolian deposition along the base of the bluff forming the siteâs eastern boundary.

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Present Investigations
The site was visited by GMI archaeologists during the 2005 and 2006 field seasons. It was
originally divided into two sites: one designated W-3, and the other considered 41ZP693.
However, upon later consideration of mapping and shovel test data, these two were comfortably
combined into a single campsite with accompanying chipped stone core reduction and biface
manufacturing debris. As a result, GMI archaeologists defined the site area considerably
differently than it had been previously (Figure 42; see also site and feature sketch maps
accompanying site form in Appendix 1). The newly defined site fills the elevated terrace
landform on which it lies, with the western margin defined by the edge of the terrace, and the
eastern margin defined by the bluff. The northern edge is a drainage that defines the south edge
of the terrace on which 41ZP691 lies, and the southern edge by a second, less-incised drainage.
Based particularly on the extent of the elevated landform and the distribution of artifacts and firecracked rock fragments across it, the site was redefined as encompassing a surface area of 9,654
m2, measuring a maximum of 144 m north-south by 82 m east-west (see Figure 42). The whole
of this terrace landform appeared to have substantial subsurface deposits, and the existence of at
least one defined feature lent the site toward feature assessment and evaluation, as included in the
original scope of work.
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2005 and 2006, lies partly outside properties
under the jurisdiction of the USIBWC. It was not until data were processed in the lab and better
aerial photographs received that GMI was made aware of this site being partly investigated
outside the project boundary.
Surface Investigations
Dozens of chipped stone artifacts, totaling approximately 75, lie across the surface of the site.
They are relatively concentrated along the base of the bluff, marking the southeastern boundary
of the site, though the overall density of artifacts is low, in the range of 2â5 per square meter.
Cores, informal flake tools, and formal tools in various stages of manufacture were noted and
mapped across the site, as a sample of those artifacts present. This sample is thought to be
representative of the approximate ratio of different types of artifacts present. Primary core
reduction debris, as well as informal and formal tools, all suggest a range of behaviors and
activities represented. Four artifacts, including three projectile point fragments, were collected
from the surface. One of these had been reworked after breakage.
The projectile points are two probable Kinney points and a likely Catan point. One of the
probable Kinney points (Artifact #1) is a laterally-broken fragment, likely due to a material defect
in the form of a banded inclusion. It is elongated, with a nicely thinned base and a steep, slightly
serrated lateral edge. It measures 6.19 cm long, 2.16 cm wide, and 0.79 cm thick. The other
probable Kinney point (Artifact #2) has been refurbished to create a small scraper. All that exists
by which to identify the point type are the base, stem, and part of the blade; the broken edge was
then reworked (2.96 cm long, 2.44 cm wide, and 0.52 cm thick). One face of the remaining lithic
tool is heavily polished, with all ridge scars worn down considerably. The probable Catan point
is diagonally broken, and its base has been relatively well-thinned (3.87 cm long, 2.32 cm wide,
and 2.32 cm thick). A Clear Fork biface was also collected from the siteâs surface (Artifact #11).
These artifacts indicate multiple components, with occupation and/or use of this site from the
Early Archaic through as late as the Late Prehistoric periods (Turner and Hester 1999).

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Other than the feature (see discussion below), there were only a few scattered fragments of firecracked rock visible on the surface. Nowhere were these fragments concentrated, and nowhere
was another feature identified.

Feature Investigation
As part of the feature evaluation and assessment undertaken during the 2005 field session,
archaeologists mapped the feature previously identified during the Parsons (2002) survey (Figure
43), and shovel-tested nearby (Shovel Test [W-3] 3; Table 36). The feature is a slightly dispersed
manifestation, measuring 1.9 m north-south by 1.6 m east-west, and consisting of 70 fragments of
fire-cracked sandstone ranging in size from approximately 3â15 cm across. Seven pieces of
chipped stone debitage were also identified within this scatter. Some of the fire-cracked rock
fragments are embedded in the surrounding sandy clay loam matrix. The shovel test, excavated
about 75 cm to the southeast of the feature, revealed neither artifacts nor fire-cracked rock among
the subsurface deposits, and further indicates that there are likely just 20 cm of deposits in this
area in which further cultural remains might be buried.

Subsurface Investigations
A total of 12 shovel tests was excavated within the defined boundary of the site (see Table 36 and
Figure 42). An additional two shovel tests were excavated outside the boundary of the site in
moderate and high-probability areas and were used, in part, to help delineate the boundary
(Shovel Tests 2 and W3-7; see discussion of nonsite shovel tests in the CUA). None of the
eleven tests was excavated to a depth greater than 50 cm below the surface. They were generally
terminated at extremely compacted clay deposits, weathered bedrock, or caliche-laden sediments.
Artifacts were recovered only from Shovel Tests 11 and W-4 (see Figure 42). A single large,
whole core reduction flake was recovered in the top 20 cm of ST W-4, and a single chalcedony
biface thinning flake was recovered from the top 5-cm in Shovel Test 11.

152

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP693 is an open campsite with lithic raw materials procurement and formal tool
production also represented. There is a low to moderate density of artifacts across the surface of
the site. A single fire-cracked rock feature was mapped, and its integrity and potential tested with
a nearby shovel test. The feature lay on what appeared to be good alluvial deposits with a
possibility for good depth and possible burial of other artifacts and features. However, the
sediments near the feature are shallow and sterile, and other shovel tests on the terrace showed
very limited depth to the subsurface deposits. This site is therefore recommended as being
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP697
Site 41ZP697 has been greatly modified during the present project to now include previously
recorded sites 41ZP698, 41ZP699, 41ZP705, 41ZP706, 41ZP710, 41ZP711, and 41ZP712 within
its bounds. All eight sites are first briefly described, as originally recorded, then are combined for
a discussion as they were redefined during the 2006 GMI investigations.

Previous Investigations
All eight sites were originally recorded during a large pedestrian reconnaissance survey
encompassing selected areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002:43â58; Table 37). These sites were all on
gravel exposures relatively close to one another. Distances between the centroids on these
various sites, as originally recorded, range from 40â200 m. All were defined as being, at least in
part, lithic materials procurement sites, with 41ZP706 also being a probable workshop area.

Present Investigations
GMI archaeologists defined the site area considerably differently than it had been previously
(Figure 44). The newly defined site fills three adjacent hills, and thus their gravel exposures, and
the areas between and around them. The scattered chipped stone debris is continuous or nearcontinuous, with gaps of just a few meters maximum. This is a site area where the previous site
plottings are considered particularly problematic. For example, previously, sites 41ZP710,
41ZP711, and 41ZP712 were placed adjacent to one another, just to the south of the newly
defined boundary of 41ZP697. However, those plotted locations would place all three sites
within a clearly identified drainage, not locations that fit their descriptions (Parsons 2002:56â58).
Given that other sites, as they appeared to GMI archaeologists, are not visible anywhere
immediately south of 41ZP697, it is presumed that all three sites are subsumed by the newlydefined larger site. Based principally on the extent of the distribution of artifacts across these
adjacent landforms, defined particularly well to the north and south by drainages, 41ZP697 was
redefined as encompassing a surface area of 35,042 m2, measuring a maximum of 284 m northsouth by 290 m east-west (see Figure 44). Few disturbances were noted across the site; a fence
line extends across a part of it in the northern half, and a little-used two-track road runs into the
southeastern portion of the site.

Surface Investigations
Hundreds of artifacts are visible on the ground surface across this site. Between and around the
various cobble exposures, densities of artifacts, though continuous, are low, in the range of 2â5
artifacts per square meter. On the gravel exposures located all along the western âarmsâ of the
site to the north and south (see Figure 44), these densities are much higher, generally in the range
of 15â20 artifacts per square meter. Debitage consists primarily of early-stage core reduction
debris, though late-stage core reduction and early-stage biface manufacturing debris are also
present. No fire-cracked rock fragments were visible on the surface of the site.
Sixteen artifacts were individually mapped; in-field analysis was conducted on 14 of these, and
two were collected. These 16 artifacts are not exhaustive of the cores and tools on the site; they
are a representative sample showing the distribution of tools and cores across the site. Of the 14
artifacts on which in-field analysis was conducted, four are cores, four are modified debitage
(flake tools), three are thick, early-stage bifaces, one is a thin late-stage biface, one is a probable
Guadalupe biface made of red-and-black chert, and one is a core reduction flake in the
southwestern part of the site mapped only to show the farthest distribution of artifacts. The
collected artifacts consist of a likely Desmuke projectile point and a second Guadalupe biface.
The likely Desmuke point (Artifact #1; see Figure 44) is made of a slate-like dark gray chert with
a waxy texture. Its widest point is slightly more than a third of the distance from the proximal to
the distal ends, and thus beyond the less than one-third range generally considered for a Desmuke
point (Turner and Hester 1999:105). It has some beveling of the lateral edges. Artifact #5 is a
Guadalupe biface that measures 7.97 cm in length, 4.52 cm wide, and 2.69 cm thick. It has some
cortex remaining along a lateral edge, and its ventral surface shows a particularly coarse chert
material, as if the artifact itself were manufactured using a natural bedding plane in the material.
These tools suggest Early to Late Archaic use of the site (Turner and Hester 1999).

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Subsurface Investigations
A total of 15 shovel tests was excavated within the defined boundary of the site (Table 38; see
Figure 44). An additional six shovel tests were excavated outside the boundary of the site and
within the mapped locations of 41ZP713 and 41ZP714 in an attempt to locate those two sites and
the three sites (41ZP710, 41ZP711, and 41ZP712) to the east (designated 710-1 through 710-6;
see discussion of nonsite shovel tests in the CUA). None of the 15 tests within the boundary of
41ZP697 was excavated to a depth greater than 45 cm below the surface, and only four exceeded
35 cm in depth before encountering either great quantities of caliche, fossilized shell and bedrock,
or extremely compacted clay.
Artifacts were recovered only from four of the tests clustered in the northwest corner of the site
during a specific search for the previously plotted location of sites 41ZP699 and 41ZP706 (shovel
tests designated 1 through 6; see Figure 44 and Table 38). These artifacts, all recovered from
between 5 and 20 cm depth, consist of two core reduction flakes, a core tool fragment, and a
modified flake fragment.
Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP697 is a lithic materials procurement and biface production site. It is horizontally very
extensive, but largely limited in vertical extent to the surface and, in a few pockets, to shallow
subsurface deposits. Few diagnostic tool forms were noted, and these suggest a significant time
range for the occupational debris, ranging from the Early to Late Archaic periods. No features or
fire-cracked rock fragments were noted among either the surface or subsurface cultural materials.
Site 41ZP697 is therefore recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP704

Previous Investigations
Site 41ZP704 was originally recorded during a pedestrian reconnaissance survey encompassing
selected areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002:50). It was described as a prehistoric lithic materials
procurement site located on a series of exposed gravel bars on the side slopes of an upland ridge
system. As recorded, the site measured approximately 165-x-100 m (16,500 m2).
Primary reduction debris and tested cobbles were recorded in moderate densities across the site.
Its research value was considered to be minimal, and impacts to the site were described as being
primarily from shoreline erosion.
Present Investigations
GMI archaeologists redocumented this lithic raw materials procurement and initial reduction site
during the 2006 field session. Based on the distribution of artifacts across the upland ridgesâ
artifacts washed down in the arroyos cutting through the site were discounted for site delineation
purposesâthe site was redefined as encompassing an area of 4,277 m2, measuring 75 m east-west

by 87 m north-south (Figure 45). The site abuts the western project boundary in this part of the
CUA. The site area is highly dissected by channels actively cutting downward from the uplands
to the west; it is denuded of most vegetation except on the ridges.
Surface Investigations
Artifacts are strewn across the upland ridges and in the channels between them. There is an
extremely high density of primary reduction debris, cores, and tested cobbles; some modified
debitage is also evident. Approximately 200 artifacts were noted in the area, and an upland
terrace at the very edge of the project area boundary was surveyed to determine whether the
artifacts were eroding from its more intact surface. No artifacts were noted on the more level
upland surface. Across the site, including within the eroded channels, no formal tools were
noted, and no artifacts were collected from the site.
Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated at the site; five of these were excavated into the upland ridges,
and the sixth was placed in the bottom of one of the channels, looking for an intact surface. Two
of the tests were excavated to depths greater than 20 cm (Table 39; see Figure 45). All tests were
terminated either at fossilized shell deposits or highly carbonated sediments. No artifacts were
noted or recovered from the subsurface deposits.
Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP704 is a lithic raw materials procurement site with remains only from the initial material
reduction activities. The site is located on a series of highly dissected ridges and in the channels
that have cut between them. The ridge surfaces are gravel-strewn, and the channel sides show
sediments dominated by fossilized shell deposits. No diagnostic artifacts were noted on the
surface of the site. Shovel testing shows no subsurface extent to the deposits. Site 41ZP704 is
therefore recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Site 41ZP707
The new boundary of site 41ZP707 now includes 41ZP708 and 41ZP709; sites 41ZP722 and
41ZP723 likely have also been subsumed by this larger site. All five sites are first briefly
described, as originally described in Parsons (2002), then are combined for a discussion as they
were redefined during the 2006 GMI investigations.

These five sites were originally recorded during a pedestrian reconnaissance survey
encompassing selected areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002:53â54, 66â69; Table 40). These sites
were all on gravel exposures relatively close to one another, and all sites were defined as lithic
materials procurement sites. Distances between the centroids on these various sites as originally
recorded range from 30 to 90 m.

Present Investigations
As with other sites in the CUA, GMI archaeologists defined the site area considerably differently
than it had been previously (Figure 46). The site is redefined as a chipped stone procurement site
and possible open campsite. The newly defined site fills the nearly-adjacent gravel exposures and
the areas between and around them. The scattered chipped stone debris is continuous or nearcontinuous, with gaps of only a few meters. Based particularly on the extent of the distribution of
artifacts across these adjacent landforms, 41ZP707 was redefined as encompassing a surface area
of 17,673 m2, measuring a maximum of 217 m north-south by 97 m east-west (see Figure 46). A
two-track road trends southwestward through the site, and another extends northward through the
western edge of the site. Few other disturbances were noted, though the vegetation through this
area was extremely dense in places. The eastern boundary of the project area very nearly defines
part of the eastern boundary of the site.

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Surface Investigations
This is a low-density scatter of lithic artifacts, with a single fire-cracked rock feature. Between
and around the various cobble exposures, densities of artifacts, though continuous, are low, in the
range of 1â3 artifacts per square meter. On the gravel exposures, which themselves are not
particularly dense, these densities are considerably higher, up to 15 artifacts per square meter.
Artifacts consist mostly of early-stage core reduction debrisâprimary and secondary debitageâ
with abundant tested cobbles. No formal tools, even early-stage tool manufacturing items, were
noted, though a few biface thinning flakes were observed. Two pieces of modified debitage were
noted and mapped.
A single fire-cracked rock feature was noted at the north end of the site, in an area overlooking a
small tributary drainage to the arroyo (see feature sketch map accompanying site form in
Appendix 1). It consists of three pieces of fire-cracked sandstone and 32 chert cobbles and
fragments; some of the chert cobble fragments may be fire-cracked. These are distributed in a
relatively dispersed pattern across a 1.3-x-1.8-m area. No artifacts were noted in the immediate
area. A single shovel test (Shovel Test 5) was excavated nearby.

Subsurface Investigations
A total of nine shovel tests was excavated within the defined boundary of the site (Table 41; see
Figure 46). None of the tests within the boundary of 41ZP707 was excavated to a depth greater
than 50 cm below the surface and only five exceeded 20 cm in depth before encountering either
great quantities of caliche, fossilized shell and bedrock, or extremely compacted clay.
Artifacts were recovered only from Shovel Test 1 (see Table 41). These artifacts, all recovered
from between 5 and 20 cm in depth, consist of 12 debitage, two cores/tested cobbles, and a
modified flake.

Site Summary and Recommendations
41ZP707 is an open camp and initial core reduction and biface manufacturing site. It consists of
a low-density scatter of artifacts, representing primarily core reduction. There are minimal
subsurface deposits; all artifacts were recovered from a single shovel test. All tests exhibited
shallow subsurface deposits extending no more than 50 cm in depth. A single, relatively
dispersed fire-cracked rock feature is present at the north end of the site, immediately south of a
shallow drainage. A shovel test excavated nearby suggests that deposits even at this end of the
site are shallow, extending to just 20 cm below the surface. As these deposits along the drainage,
however, have the potential for retaining intact burned rock features, further testing of these
deposits is needed to establish whether this site retains contextual integrity and might provide
data important to an understanding of the prehistory of the region. The eligibility of this site for
inclusion in the NRHP is therefore presently unknown.

Site 41ZP720
The new boundary of site 41ZP720 is thought to include 41ZP721 as well. These sites are first
briefly described, as originally described in Parsons (2002), then combined for a discussion as
they were redefined during the 2006 GMI investigations.

Previous Investigations
Both sites were originally recorded during the pedestrian reconnaissance survey encompassing
selected areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002:66â67). Both sites were recorded as being on T3
terraces, with gravel exposures, and both were defined as lithic raw materials procurement sites;
only cores, tested cobbles and primary reduction debris were documented at each. Distances
between the centroids on these two sites as originally recorded are approximately 130 m.

163

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

Present Investigations
As with other sites in the CUA, GMI archaeologists defined the site area considerably differently
than it had been previously (Figure 47). The site is redefined as a chipped stone procurement site.
The newly defined site fills the two close-by gravel exposures and the area between them. The
low-density, scattered, chipped stone debris is continuous or near-continuous, with gaps of only a
few meters. Based particularly on the extent of the distribution of artifacts across these adjacent
landforms, 41ZP720 was redefined as encompassing a surface area of 13,403 m2, measuring a
maximum of 157 m north-south by 114 m east-west (see Figure 47). Four two- track roads
converge in the east-center of the site, and a fence line trends southwestward through the
southeastern portion of the site.

Surface Investigations
This is a low-density scatter of lithic artifacts. Between and around the various cobble exposures,
densities of artifacts, though continuous, are low, in the range of 1â3 artifacts per square meter.
On the gravel exposures, these densities are somewhat higher, up to 5 artifacts per square meter.
Artifacts consist entirely of early-stage core reduction debrisâprimary and secondary debitageâ
with numerous tested cobbles. No formal tools, even early-stage tool manufacturing items, were
noted, and no biface thinning flakes were identified. A single piece of modified debitage was
noted and mapped.

Subsurface Investigations
A total of nine shovel tests was excavated within the defined boundary of the site (Table 42; see
Figure 47). None of these tests exceeded 40-cm depth before encountering highly compacted
clay, fossilized shell, or gravels. Only a single artifact was recovered from the subsurface
deposits: a probable fragment of a biface thinning flake from the top 10 cm in Shovel Test 5.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP720 is a low-density lithic materials procurement and initial reduction site. It is
horizontally expansive, but vertically limited, with only a single artifact recovered from the
subsurface deposits. No diagnostic chipped stone tools were noted, and no fire-cracked rock
features were recorded. This site is therefore recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP.

Site 41ZP743
The new boundary of site 41ZP743 is thought to include site 41ZP748 as well. These sites are
first briefly described, as originally described in Parsons (2002), then are combined for a
discussion as they were redefined during the 2006 GMI investigations.

Previous Investigations
These two sites were originally recorded by Parsons (2002:92, 96) as part of the large
reconnaissance survey of portions of the CUA. Both were also recorded as lithic materials
procurement sites; gravel bars were described at each. Cores, tested cobbles, and primary core
reduction debris were identified at each. Site 41ZP743 was described as having low densities of
2â3 artifacts per square meter, and 41ZP748 was described as having a much higher density of 15
artifacts per square meter. The approximate center points of the two sites are plotted as being
roughly 125 m apart.

Present Investigation
The site was redocumented in 2006 by GMI archaeologists, who defined the site area
considerably differently than Parsons (2002). The sites are on adjacent gravel exposures, and a
scatter of lithic material is nearly continuous between them. Based on the continuity of surface
artifacts, site 41ZP743 was redefined as encompassing an area of 7,738 m2, measuring 145 m
northwest-southeast by 73 m southwest-northeast (Figure 48).

Surface Investigations
Approximately 150 artifacts were observed on the surface of the site, ringing and connecting both
gravel exposures. Most of the artifacts are primary core reduction debris, though some thinning
and other interior flakes were also identified. The densities of chipped stone artifacts are low
throughout, in the range of 2â3 artifacts per square meter. No formal tools were noted, and no
artifacts were collected from the surface of the site.

Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated along the lower edges of the gravel caps that define the site area
(Table 43; see Figure 48). None of the six tests was excavated to greater than 30-cm depth below
modern ground surface, and cultural materials were not recovered from any of them. The tests
were terminated at fossilized shell, gravels, or compacted sediments.

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP743 is a low-density scatter of primary lithic material procurement and initial core
reduction debris. Artifacts consist almost entirely of primary core reduction debris with no
formal tools noted. Six shovel tests failed to reveal a subsurface extent to the site. Site 41ZP743
is therefore recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

168

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Site 41ZP745

Previous Investigations
41ZP745 was originally recorded during the pedestrian reconnaissance survey encompassing
selected areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002:92â93). It was defined as an extensive prehistoric open
camp on the gentle southeast slope of a T3 terrace remnant. It was originally recorded as
measuring 140-x-120 m (16,800 m2). Vegetation at the site was described as consisting of thin to
dense stands of mesquite with no understory, providing surface visibility of 90 to 100 percent.
Cultural materials recorded included a hearth, a thin scatter of burned rock, and chipped stone
debitage and debris. The hearth, located in the northcentral part of the site, was described as â. . . a
distinct concentration of burned rock in an area measuring about 2 m in diameterâ (Parsons
2002:92). The lithic artifacts included a cobble chopper, flaked cobbles, primary lithic material
reduction debitage, and additional burned rock. Impacts were described as minimal, and it was
assigned a moderate to high research potential.

Present Investigations
GMI archaeologists redocumented the site during the 2005 and 2006 field sessions. It was
initially visited as part of the feature evaluation program, which was discontinued after the 2005
field season. Although possibly still a prehistoric open campsite, GMI archaeologists redefined
significant portions of the site, based on that initial visit, to include at least one historic
component and likely multiple historic components. It has been redefined as encompassing an
area of 4,582 m2, measuring 104 m southwest-northeast by 72 m southeast-northwest (Figure 49).

Surface Investigations
The concentration of rock, designated by the earlier survey as a hearth feature, was redefined as
an unburned rock cairn (Figure 50), likely dating to the historic era, though no artifacts were
found in association by which to date the feature. This pile of rock measures 3.5 m north-south
by 2 m east-west and rises approximately 30 cm above the modern (though likely eroded) ground
surface. It consists of approximately 110 rocks, ranging in size from 8â45 cm in length. None of
the rock appears to be burned.
Other features were also identified during redocumentation of the site. Immediately northeast of
the cairn is a large exposure of sandstone bedrock, above which the ground surface levels out.
On some of these boulders are a series of unusually straight marks or grooves (Figure 51). At
least five boulders have distinct grooves that likely are the result of human activity, possibly from
heavy machinery or possibly natural breaks that were exaggerated by use for resharpening metal
or stone implements. Again, as with the cairn, there are no indications of whether the feature
dates to the historic or prehistoric eras.

Old U.S. Hwy 83 runs along the eastern edge of the site (see Figure 49). About 43 m southeast of
the rock cairn is a culvert along the old roadway with a plaque dating its placement to 1939. The
text on the plaque reads: âTexas State Highway Department 1939 Contractor HB Zachary.â The
culvert itself is almost completely buried by alluvium up to the level of the plaque that was placed
at the top of it.
Chipped stone debitage is scattered across the site in moderate quantities, though not in particular
concentrations. A single proximal fragment of a middle-stage biface was also noted in the
western part of the site). Fire-cracked rock fragments were noted only as widely scattered pieces.
A few historic artifacts, in the form of unidentifiable glass and metal fragments, and a few can
fragments, were also present, particularly in the eastern half of the site.

Subsurface Investigations
A total of six shovel tests was excavated within the defined boundary of the site (Table 44).
Shovel Test 1 was excavated immediately adjacent to the rock cairn in order to test the integrity
in the area. The test was excavated to 20 cm before encountering deposits too compact to
continue. None of these tests exceeded 40-cm depth before encountering highly compacted clay,
fossilized shell, or gravels. No artifacts were recovered from any of the subsurface deposits.

Site Summary and Recommendations
There is a large and diverse array of cultural remains at site 41ZP745. The prehistoric component
at the site is very limited in scope. A few scattered artifacts and widely scattered fragments of
fire-cracked rock are all that remain. Subsurface deposits are nonexistent. Historic refuse is
limited, but at least one historic feature and one probable historic feature are present. The
highway culvert plaque along Old U.S. Hwy 83 recognizes that this road stretched through this

Chapter 5: Survey Results

entire region and allowed transportation up and down the river until its abandonment at the time
the dam and reservoir were constructed. However, remains of this road are present throughout
the region; this section is in poor condition and is presently in use as an access point for the
reservoir. The rock cairn, also likely dating to the historic era, is an impressive feature, though
unaccompanied by artifacts. The feature exhibits no characteristics that allow one to definitely
date its construction or to suggest its purpose. Finally, the intentional grooves in the boulder
exposures behind the cairn appear to be from sharpening either stone or metal implements, but
again there is nothing by which to date this use. It is unlikely that site 41ZP745 will provide data
important to an understanding of the prehistory or history of the region. Therefore, site 41ZP745
is recommended as not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP765
The new boundary of site 41ZP765 includes previously recorded site 41ZP786. These sites are
first briefly described, as originally described in Parsons (2002), then are combined for a
discussion as they were redefined during the 2006 GMI investigations.

Previous Investigations
Both sites were originally recorded during a pedestrian reconnaissance survey encompassing
selected areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002:120â121, 144). Site 41ZP765, a primary lithic materials
procurement site, was recorded as being on heavily dissected lobes at the base of a T3 terrace,
and 41ZP786, a prehistoric open campsite, was recorded as being atop the T3 terrace. Distances
between the centroids on these two sites as originally recorded are approximately 200 m.
The landform on which site 41ZP765 was recorded is capped with Uvalde gravel deposits. The
surface scatter consisted of primary, secondary, and tertiary debitage, with some cores and tested
cobbles. This scatter is on the gravel deposits and was described as extending upslope and
slightly onto the T3 terrace. Parsons (2002:121) notes that âthe occurrence of lithic debitage from
all stages of manufacture strongly suggests that an open camp with burned rock features most
likely exists further up the terrace slope and remains buried under colluvium.â
Site 41ZP786 was described as a prehistoric open camp possibly dating to the Middle Archaic
period. The cultural materials identified at the site included a fairly diffuse scatter of lithic
debitage and tools, and two burned rock features. The lithic artifacts included cores and tested
cobbles, primary and secondary flakes, interior flakes, and both formal and informal tools. Two
features were identified at the site. Feature 1, on the north side of the site, measured about 5-x-3
m; it contained scattered fragments of burned sandstone and quartzite, and a concentration of
lithic debitage and debris. A Tortugas point was collected nearby. Feature 2, on the southwest
side of the drainage that bisects the site, consisted of a 50-x-50-cm concentration of dark gray
sandstone, with a few associated chipped stone artifacts.

Present Investigations
As with other sites in the CUA, GMI archaeologists defined the site area considerably differently
than it had been previously (Figure 52). It is a prehistoric open campsite and primary lithic raw
materials procurement site. Based upon both the surface scatter of artifacts, which is nearly
continuous between the two previously recorded sites, and the results of shovel testing, these sites
were combined to encompass a surface area of 26,742 m2, measuring a maximum of 257 m
southwest-northeast by 173 m northwest-southeast (see Figure 52). A two-track road runs
continuously from the southwest edge of the site to the northeast edge. Few other disturbances
were noted.
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2006, lies partly outside properties under the
jurisdiction of the USIBWC. It also likely extends far outside the boundary. Property markers
were not found in this immediate area, and it was not until data were processed in the lab and
better aerial photographs received that GMI was made aware of this site being partly investigated
outside the project boundary.

Surface Investigations
There is a moderate density of chipped stone artifacts across the site, both on the terrace and on
the gravel exposures below the terrace to the west. Artifacts include early- and middle-stage core
reduction debris and biface manufacturing debris. Only a single biface was noted on the site; no
artifacts were collected. Four fire-cracked rock features were identified atop the terrace (see
Figure 52).

Subsurface Investigations
Eleven shovel tests were excavated during boundary delineation efforts (Table 45; see Figure 52).
Four were excavated in the vicinity of the four fire-cracked rock features, as part of the feature
assessment efforts begun in 2005.
Feature 1, located in the southwest part of the site, is an eroded cluster of fire-cracked rock,
measuring 1.3 m long by 0.5 m wide and consisting of nine fragments of sandstone and six chert
flakes (Figure 53). Shovel Test 6 (786) was excavated immediately east of this cluster. A core
reduction flake and a single piece of shatter were recovered from the top 20 cm, the shovel test
was excavated only to 60 cm before encountering highly compacted sediments.
Feature 2, located approximately 20 m upslope from Feature 1, is a small cluster of nine
fragments of fire-cracked sandstone, measuring 35-x-35 cm (Figure 54). No artifacts are visible
in its immediate vicinity, and no stain is visible on the surface. Shovel Test 7 (786) was
excavated about 50 cm to the west of the cluster. It was excavated to 1.0-m depth, and three
chipped stone artifacts were recovered from between 7â60 cm below the surface.

Feature 3 is a 75-x-75-cm diameter fire-cracked rock feature consisting of 11 fragments of
sandstone, 19 cobbles, and four chipped stone artifacts (Figure 55). A fishing lure is near the
center of this slightly dispersed feature. Shovel Test 8 was excavated about 30 cm to the
northwest of it. It was excavated to 50-cm depth, and four additional fragments of fire-cracked
rock were noted in the top 20 cm. No artifacts were recovered from the test, and the test was
terminated when dense gravels were encountered.

Feature 4 is a dispersed scatter of fire-cracked rock measuring 1.7-x-1.2 m in diameter. It
consists of seven fire-cracked fragments of sandstone and 33 small cobbles. A tested cobble and
two pieces of chipped stone debitage lay along the western edge of the feature. Shovel Test 9
was placed approximately 40 cm to the northwest of the cluster of rock. It was excavated to just
20-cm depth and a core reduction flake was recovered from it. The test was terminated at
bedrock.
The other seven shovel tests were scattered across the surface of the site. Four of these were also
atop the terrace. Shovel Test 4,10, and 11 were all negative for cultural deposits, and were
terminated between 10 and 45 cm when gravels were encountered. Shovel Test 5, located on the
edge of the terrace just above the gravel lobes, was excavated to 45-cm depth, at which point it
was terminated due to increasing compactness and carbonate content. In the top 40 cm, however,
three pieces of shatter, five indeterminate flake fragments, a core reduction flake, and a proximal
fragment of a thin, late-stage biface were identified.
Shovel Tests 1, 2, and 3 were placed on the gravel lobes below the terrace. A single core
reduction flake was recovered from between 20 and 35 cm in depth in Shovel Test 1, and the test
was terminated shortly thereafter when a gravel lens was encountered. No other artifacts were
recovered from these tests. Shovel Test 2 was terminated at 20 cm when carbonate nodules were
encountered. Shovel Test 3 was terminated at 5 cm as the sediments were too compacted to
excavate further.

Chapter 5: Survey Results

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP765 is a widespread open camp site with accompanying primary to late core reduction
and biface manufacturing debris. There is a moderately dense scatter of chipped stone debris
across the site. Four fire-cracked rock features are present on the high terrace, two of which
appear relatively intact atop the terrace. Subsurface deposits are somewhat spotty across the site,
including sparse quantities of fire-cracked rock fragments and a formal tool. However, these
deposits, including those atop the terrace, are relatively shallow. Given the possibility for more,
buried features, further testing of these deposits is needed to establish whether this site retains
contextual integrity and might provide data important to an understanding of the prehistory of the
region. The eligibility of site 41ZP765for inclusion in the NRHP is therefore presently unknown.

Site 41ZP766

Previous Investigations
Site 41ZP766 was originally recorded during a pedestrian reconnaissance survey encompassing
selected areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002:122). It was defined as a prehistoric open camp on a
lower gently-sloping T3 terrace and was originally recorded as measuring 130-x-100 m
(13,000 m2). Vegetation at the site was described as consisting of thin to dense stands of
mesquite with no understory, providing surface visibility of 90 to 100 percent.
Cultural materials recorded included two hearths, a burned rock cluster, and a thin scatter of
chipped stone debitage. A gouge and a bifacially modified flake tool were collected from the
siteâs surface. Impacts were described as minimal, and it was assigned a moderate to high
research potential.

Present Investigations
GMI archaeologists redocumented the site during the 2005 field sessions, as part of the feature
assessment program. Based on the distribution of surface artifacts, the site has been redefined as
encompassing a surface area of 6,917 m2, measuring 122 m east-west by 79 m north-south
(Figure 56). Part of the site may still be submerged, but the plotted location, as mapped by GMI
archaeologists in 2005, is south of the originally plotted location in the data provided by IBWC.

Surface Investigations
A surface scatter of artifacts was visible; this consisted of approximately 50 pieces of core
reduction and biface manufacturing debitage. A gravel exposure is evident in the site area. No
formal tools were noted, and no artifacts were collected. The previously recorded features could
not be located, perhaps because a part of the site was still submerged during the 2005 field
season. The UTM centroid for the previously recorded site was determined to be approximately
40 m farther into the water.

Subsurface Investigations
Six shovel tests were excavated at the site; these were clustered within an area of the thin chipped
stone surface scatter, and close to the waterâs edge. Three of the tests were excavated to depths
greater than 50 cm (Table 46; see Figure 56). Cultural materials were recovered from four of the
shovel tests.

A piece of modified debitage, two biface thinning flakes, and a small tested cobbled were

a piece of shatter, and four chunks of fire-cracked chert were identified from the deposits
extending from 7â20 cm in depth in Shovel Test 3. Two core reduction flake were recovered
from the top 15 cm in Shovel Test 4, and a single indeterminate flake fragment was identified
from the top 10 cm in Shovel Test 6. The tests were all terminated when gravels, extremely
compacted sediments, or high quantities of carbonates were encountered.
Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP766, originally recorded as an open campsite, was not fully located during the GMI
survey. The previously recorded UTM coordinates appear to place the site north of its actual
location. GMI archaeologists visited the site and were led by a surface scatter of chipped stone
181

Cultural Resources Survey of 601 Acres at Falcon Reservoir, Zapata County, Texas

artifacts to the waterâs edge, where it appeared that the fire-cracked rock features were still
inundated by the reservoir. The features, then were not found and not mapped or evaluated.
Shovel testing along the waterâs edge, amidst the artifact scatter, showed a limited extent to the
subsurface deposits in this part of the site, but, as most of the site was not visited, neither
evaluations of the features nor recommendations for the site can be made.

Site 41ZP785

Previous Investigations
41ZP785 was originally recorded during a pedestrian reconnaissance survey encompassing
selected areas in the CUA (Parsons 2002:143). It was defined as a prehistoric lithic raw materials
procurement site, situated on a flat ridge with exposed gravels. It was originally recorded as
measuring 120-x-50 m (6,000 m2). Cultural materials recorded included tested cobbles and cores,
modified debitage, and core reduction and biface thinning flakes. Impacts were described as
minimal, and it was assigned a moderate to high research potential due to a possible association
with habitation activities (based on a high density of tertiary flakes in one area), and the further
possibility of buried features.

Present Investigations
GMI archaeologists redocumented the site during the 2006 field session. Based on the
distribution of surface artifacts, the site has been redefined as encompassing a surface area of
4,721 m2, measuring 127 m southwest-northeast by 52 m northwest-southeast (Figure 57). Just as
importantly, GMI archaeologists also replotted the site such that it followed the level ridge, as
defined by the surface distribution of artifacts.
The site, as recorded by GMI archaeologists in 2006, lies partly outside properties under the
jurisdiction of the USIBWC. A single property marker is visible on the site, but it is unclear in
which direction the lands under jurisdiction of the USIBWC continue from that marker. Once
collected data were processed in the lab and better aerial photographs received, GMI was able to
clarify exactly where the project boundary was within the defined boundary of the site.

Surface Investigations
The density of surface visible artifacts is moderate to high, ranging from 14â17 artifacts per
square meter in the highest density areas. Most of the artifacts noted are early- to middle-stage
core reduction debris. Thirteen artifacts were individually mapped to show the approximate
distribution of chipped stone across the site (see Figure 57). These artifacts consisted of seven
pieces of modified debitage and six cores. No formal tools were noted, and no artifacts were
collected from the surface of the site. No fragments of fire-cracked rock were noted on the
surface.

Site Summary and Recommendations
This site is a lithic materials procurement and initial core reduction site. It consists of a relatively
high-density surface scatter of cores, tested cobbles, and debitage. No features were identified,
and no formal tools were noted. As the site also lacks subsurface extent, 41ZP785 is
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Newly Recorded Sites

Site 41ZP925
Site 41ZP925 is a lithic raw materials procurement site and open campsite. It consists primarily
of lithic artifacts visible on a series of gravel exposures on small hillocks or rises (Figure 58).
These small hillocks are separated from one another only by slightly lower, occasionally sloping,
grassy areas in which surface artifacts are more obscured but may also not be present at all; the
distance between these exposures is sometimes as little as just a few meters, but may be at
distances up to 30 m from one another. The site encompasses an area of 34,396 m2, measuring
315 m north-south by 142 m east-west.
Though no sites had previously been recorded in this specific area, site 41ZP795 lies north of site
41ZP925, just outside of the present survey boundary, and it may be associated with the presently
recorded 41ZP925. Further, site 41ZP695 lies immediately west of site 41ZP925, beneath the
present water level, and is also most likely continuous with the present site. Natural, topographic

features were used to define the western, eastern, and southern site boundary. The western
boundary is that of the current lake level, which does impinge, to some degree, upon the current
survey boundary. The northeastern and eastcentral boundary is defined by the lower, taluscovered slopes of the bluff, and the southeastern edge is defined by the clear, level terrace on
which site 41ZP691 lies. The southern edge of the site is defined by a shallow drainage.
A particularly concentrated area of chipped stone debitage and scattered fire-cracked rock
fragments define a core area to the site. This concentration is at the northeast edge, near the base
of the bluff, but clear of the large blocky talus debris. There is a thick, widespread gravel deposit
here, which is where the chipped stone debris is also densest.
Surface Investigations
The site boundary was determined on the bases of the relatively continuous distribution of
artifacts with up to 20 m or so gaps between visible gravel caps. Approximately 200 artifacts
were identified across the site area. Primary, secondary, and tertiary chipped stone debris were
all noted, as were a few cores and tested cobbles. Four bifaces were mapped (see Figure 58).
One is a thick, early-stage biface made of speckled brown chert, and another is a medial fragment
of a thin, late-stage biface or projectile point made of tan chert. As neither was considered
temporally diagnostic, they were not collected, and no other formal tools were noted.
Two areas of fire-cracked rock, the only fragments noted on the site, were identified toward the
north end of the site. A relatively concentrated scatter consists of 12 fragments across a 6-x-10-m
area. A few flakes and a core were noted nearby. Feature 1, located approximately 10 m
northeast of the scatter, consists of 28 fragments of fire-cracked sandstone and two pieces of lithic
debitage in a 1.0-x-1.5-m area.
Subsurface Investigations
Thirteen shovel tests were excavated across the landform to identify the siteâs horizontal and
vertical extents (Table 48; see Figure 58). They were excavated both on and between the gravel
exposures. These gravel exposures are lenses just 10 to 15 cm thick, and immediately under the
gravels is generally a thin layer of silty clay loam, underlain by either clay or mottled yellow
clayey loam; greater depths bring increased carbonate inclusions. The lack of sediments across
the top of the gravels may generally be considered to have resulted from scouring by the lake
waters.
Shovel Test 3 was placed near Feature 1. It was excavated to 35-cm depth, at which point highly
compacted sediments were encountered. Shovel Test 5 was placed near the fire-cracked rock
scatter and was terminated at 50-cm depth when mottled clays were encountered. Artifacts were
not recovered from either of these tests, but two fragments of fire-cracked rock were noted in the
top 4 cm of Shovel Test 3.
No cultural deposits were encountered in any of the other shovel tests, which were scattered
across this landform. The deepest test was excavated to 80-cm depth, but most were terminated
at far shallower depths. Tests were terminated when mottled sediments, fossilized shell, or
extremely compacted sediments were encountered.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP925 is an extensive surface scatter of chipped stone debris associated with primary core
reduction activities. There is a continuous low density of chipped stone artifacts across the site,
with a relative concentration noted toward the northeast edge. In this same area is a concentration
of fire-cracked rock and a fire-cracked rock feature. Both were evaluated with shovel tests
nearby, and there does not appear to be associated subsurface deposits. Shovel testing across the
site indicates a general lack of subsurface deposits in association with any of the artifacts. Site
41ZP925 is therefore recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41ZP926
This lithic raw materials procurement site lies on a single gravel-capped knoll or rise and consists
of a high density of primary flakes, tested cobbles, and cores (Figure 59). The site measures 96 m
north-south by 61 m east-west (4,223 m2). Vegetation is sparse atop the gravel cap itself, and
consists of a few scattered mesquite trees and some low-lying grasses. Just off the gravel cap,
vegetation, including the grasses, becomes much denser and includes prickly pear, dense stands
of mesquite, and various other prickly and thorny brush.

Surface Investigations
Approximately 150 artifacts are present across the surface of the site. There is an approximate
density of 26 artifacts per square meter in the highest density parts, and a density of roughly 15
per square meter in the lower density areas. In addition to primary core reduction debris, large
tertiary flakes and some biface production debris are also represented. Cobbles on the surface of
the site range from 5â20 cm in diameter. A single informal tool of modified debitage and a
formal tool of a thin, late-stage biface fragment were also noted. No other tools were identified,
and no artifacts were collected from the surface of this site.

Subsurface Investigations
Shovel tests were placed around the edges of the gravel cap in areas where the artifact density fell
off to minimal levels (Table 49). Six shovel tests were excavated in these areas, primarily where
there appeared to be a possibility of buried deposits (i.e., downslope of the gravel exposures). A
single flake was found subsurface from 15â20 cm in Shovel Test 5. All other shovel tests were
negative, and the likelihood of a subsurface component to the site is considered very low. This is
one of the rare sites without other exposed gravel caps nearby and it, therefore, is restricted in its
extent.

Site Summary and Recommendations
Site 41ZP926 is a high-density lithic raw material procurement site, with primary core reduction
debris across the surface. It is limited in its horizontal extent to just the gravel cap of the hill, and
shovel testing immediately below the cap in all directions indicates that it is also restricted in its

present, and no formal tools at all were noted. Site 41ZP926 is therefore recommended as
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Sites Not Revisited
Eleven previously recorded sites in the CUA were not found during the present survey (Table 50).
GMI archaeologists believe that these sites were not located for one or a combination of the
following reasons. Chipped stone debitage was nearly continuously present across most of the
surveyed area. Very low densities of these artifacts were considered âbackground noiseâ if a
connection to a denser concentration could not be drawn.
Second, there were often problems with finding a siteâs actual plotted location. GMI
archaeologists used two forms of data to attempt to locate sites. Data provided on hard copies of
site forms were used to locate sites as registered through the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas
program. GIS data obtained from the USIBWC were also loaded onto a hand-held TrimbleÂ®
Geo-Explorer 3 GPS unit to find the plotted locations of archaeological sites. Sometimes these
two sources of data were in agreement, and other times not. When not in agreement, the crew
expended considerable effort going back and forth between two distinct locations on the
landscape scanning the surface in between in order to be assured of not missing indications of the
site.
In some cases, while in an area looking for a previously recorded site, if the ground surface was
not visible due to dense vegetation or subsurface deposits were suspected, shovel testing was used
in one or both of the locations as indicated by the two sources of data (see Table 50). On the
other hand, if gravels were exposed in one or both of those locations, shovel tests were rarely
used to locate sites as experience had already demonstrated that artifacts were not generally
present below the surface gravel exposures.

GMI archaeologists conducted survey in all the site areas, as the plotted site locations were
understood, and shovel testing was also sometimes conducted as needed. There are several
reasons that a site might not have been located during the present survey. Existing data for site
locations may be in error, the density of artifacts may be so low as to be actually considered
background noise, or vegetation may have been dense enough to prevent surface recognition of a
site area. As the sites were not located, eligibility recommendations cannot be made, and the sites
should be considered of undetermined eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

CUA Nonsite Shovel Tests
Fifty-seven shovel tests were located outside the boundaries of defined archaeological sites in the
CUA. Twelve of these nonsite tests were specifically placed to help define site boundaries during
the recording phase of work (Table 51), and thus all were negative for subsurface cultural
deposits. These tests are mentioned in earlier site discussions as tests used for boundary
delineations, because they were used to help define the horizontal and vertical extent of sites.
An additional 39 of the nonsite shovel tests were specifically placed while attempting to locate
previously recorded sites, as discussed above. These 39 tests (Table 52) were placed to search for
seven of the sites not found.
Finally, just six additional shovel tests excavated in the CUA were associated only with testing
moderate- and high-probability areas. There were two primary reasons for the use of so few tests
in the area. First, moderate- and high-probability areasâdefined as those areas having a greater
likelihood for buried cultural depositsâare fewer in the CUA than in the NUA. Second, there are

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

SUMMARY
Archaeologists from GMI conducted archaeological survey of 601 acres and preliminarily
assessed features at previously reported sites in the âCentral Unsurveyed Areaâ (CUA) and
âNorthern Unsurveyed Areaâ (NUA) of Falcon Reservoir in Zapata County, Texas.
Archaeologists from the team of Camp Dresser and McKee (CDM) and Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI)
conducted the investigations under contract to the United States Section of the International
Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) to assist in efforts by the USIBWC to satisfy
archaeological site inventory and eligibility determinations under Section 110 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
Survey consisted of 385 acres in the NUA and 216 acres in the CUA. Thirty-nine sites were
either revisited and updated or newly recorded during the total course of the present project. In
the NUA, this consisted of 24 archaeological sites recorded; one additional site was later
discovered to lie outside the project boundaries and thus on lands outside the jurisdiction of the
USIBWC. Seven of these sites were previously recorded (Hughes 1950; Parsons 2002), and 17
were newly recorded during the present survey. Twenty of these sites were recorded as having
exclusively prehistoric components; three previously recorded sites were identified as having
both an historic and a prehistoric component; and two newly recorded sites were identified as
having components dating to both periods.
Fourteen sites were either newly recorded or their records updated in the CUA. Of these, 12 had
been previously recorded (Parsons 2002), and just two were newly documented during the present
survey. During the rerecording of sites in the CUA, substantial changes were made, such that
many previously recorded sites were combined into single manifestations, given careful
inspection of the ground surface between sites. As a result, 21 previously recorded sites in the
area were encompassed by five total sites (see Table 2). Additionally, eleven previously recorded
sites in the CUA (41ZP186, 41ZP713, 41ZP714, 41ZP718, 41ZP719, 41ZP742, 41ZP746,
41ZP747, 41ZP749, 41ZP763, and 41ZP777) were not relocated. Sites in the CUA include
thirteen with exclusively prehistoric components, and one with both historic and prehistoric
components.

NATIONAL REGISTER ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Sites documented during the survey were subject to recommendations of eligibility for the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The qualification of a cultural resource as eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP is based on the applicability of four criteria for evaluation defined by
36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 60. Relevant research domains are first identified.
Then, the following criteria are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and
(a) That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR Â§ 60.4, emphasis added].

The physical characteristics and historic significance of the overall property are examined when
conducting NRHP evaluations. While a property in its entirety may be considered eligible based
on Criteria A, B, C, and/or D, specific data are also required for individual components therein
based on date, function, history, physical characteristics, and other information. Resources that
do not relate in a significant way to the overall property may contribute if they independently
meet the National Register criteria.
The scientific value of prehistoric archaeological sites is assessed under Criterion D. With regard
specifically to this criterion, the goal of prehistoric archaeological research and management is to
fill gaps in our knowledge about specific research domains. Scientific importance is partially
driven by the research paradigms of the time and in part by the amount of information available
about a particular research topic in a specific geographic area. The most robust forms of
scientific importance should honor diverse and occasionally competing schools of research
interests and their attendant approaches. In order to fulfill Criterion D, a site must possess certain
attributes, such as intact buried cultural strata with functionally and temporally diagnostic
materials, datable cultural features, and so on, such that further intensive research at the site could
be expected to add additional information to relevant research questions.
The research domains are addressed through testing and excavation programs; over time, data
required for addressing specific questions are collected, analyzed, and compiled. Eventually, the
potential importance, or significance, of sites that contain only the types of data already collected
may diminish. This suggests that the identification criteria of important historic properties are
tied to both a specific geographic area reflecting a cultural adaptation or cultural region and a
state of accumulated knowledge about a research domain topic. The criteria and priorities of
important sites are apt to shift as accepted research paradigms change or as data accumulations
approach redundancy. Archaeological sites that retain contextual integrity and contain artifacts
and features capable of contributing information toward addressing relevant research issues are
significant and should therefore be considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

196

Chapter 6: Summary and Recommendations

NATIONAL REGISTER ELIGIBILITY SUMMARY
Archaeological properties considered in the present report were judged to be eligible, not eligible,
or of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. Eligibility determinations for the 38
archaeological sites on USIBWC-administered property focused on two elements: (1) the degree
of contextual integrity exhibited by each site (i.e., are individual components isolable within the
sediment matrix?) and (2) the potential for data recovery that will contribute to our understanding
of regional research questions. Given the limited nature of the subsurface investigations, no sites
were regarded as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Although several sites exhibited the
potential for buried deposits, the limited shovel testing provided little information regarding
contextual integrity and the ability to recover datable materials and subsistence-related data.
Therefore, the majority of the sites was recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion
in the NRHP. Some previous investigators might have used the term âpotentially eligibleâ for
these sites where information is not sufficient for a final determination. Until such time as these
sites are further assessed for significance, these sites should be preserved and protected. A
recommendation of ânot eligibleâ was applied to those sites that did not exhibit contextual
integrity (i.e., palimpsest contexts) or failed to exhibit an artifact assemblage or feature complex
that would allow one to address meaningful research questions related to technology, settlementsubsistence patterns, or extra-regional interaction.
Within the NUA, 11 sites (41ZP927, 41ZP928, 41ZP929, 41ZP931, 41ZP935, 41ZP936,
41ZP942, 41ZP944, 41ZP811, 41ZP815, and 41ZP816), are recommended as ineligible (Table
54). These sites lack contextual integrity due to either the lack of significant subsurface deposits
or to the presence of multiple components overprinted on one another, thus forming a palimpsest.
Many of these sites are limited surface manifestations, consisting only or primarily of initial lithic
raw materials procurement and reduction without an accompanying subsurface extent. Thirteen
of the sites (41ZP1, 41ZP807, 41ZP808, 41ZP809, 41ZP930, 41ZP932, 41ZP933, 41ZP934,
41ZP937, 41ZP938, 41ZP940, 41ZP941, and 41ZP943,) are recommended as being of unknown
eligibility. The prehistoric components frequently exhibit the potential for containing buried
deposits with intact features; however, the limited shovel testing does not provide sufficient
information related to contextual integrity and data potential to warrant a final eligibility
determination under Criterion D. It is recommended that test excavations are needed at these
sites to provide sufficient information for a final determination. For those sites with substantial
historic components (41ZP1, 41ZP809, 41ZP938, and 41ZP941), archival research is
recommended for a determination of eligibility under Criteria A and B in addition to the test
excavations for determination under Criterion D. An eligibility recommendation is not offered
for one site initially thought to be within the survey parcel; site 41ZP939 falls outside lands under
the jurisdiction of the USIBWC.
Of the 14 sites in the CUA parcel, two sites are recommended as being of unknown eligibility.
for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D (Table 55). Both are prehistoric sites that exhibit the
potential for buried contexts; however, test excavations are needed for clearly determining
contextual integrity and the potential for data relevant to addressing regional research issues.
Eleven sites in the CUA are recommended as not eligible, for they do not exhibit sufficient data
potential under Criterion D. An eligibility recommendation is not offered for site 41ZP766,
which was revisited as part of the initial feature evaluation part of the present project. The
features were not relocated and much of the site was still inundated by the reservoir.
