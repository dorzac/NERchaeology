ABSTRACT
An archaeological evaluation of four areas in central Cherokee County, Texas was
performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in September 2003 under Texas
Antiquities Permit 3213. This project was reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division. The Federal agency involved with this project is the United States
Department of Agriculture, Rural Development. No archaeological sites were found in any
of the four areas surveyed. It is, therefore, recommended that the Dialville-Oakland Water
Supply Corporation be allowed to proceed with construction as planned with no further
archaeological investigations. Copies of this report are on file at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory; Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division; Dialville-Oakland
Water Supply Corporation in Alto, Texas; and Brazos Valley Research Associates in
Bryan, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by Dialville-Oakland Water Supply Corporation (WSC) through
J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc., Consulting Engineers of Palestine, Texas, to conduct a
cultural resources survey of four segments of a proposed water line that will service the
residents of rural Cherokee County (Figure 1). The four survey areas are depicted on the
USGS 7.5' topographic map Rusk dated 1973 (map number 3195-442). Survey areas 1
and 2 are depicted in Figure 2, and survey areas 3 and 4 are depicted in Figure 3.
Improvements to the distribution system will consist of adding approximately 2.2
miles of new water line throughout the existing service. The majority of the line will be
installed along state and county roads within rights-of-way where disturbance has occurred
due to trenching associated with existing lines. Large trees within paths of pipelines will be
avoided where possible by either rerouting around or boring under to prevent damage to
the trees. Creek crossings by the proposed water lines will be encased and creek bottoms
restored to their original condition.
According to a letter from F. Lawrence Oaks, State Historic Preservation Office,
dated August 5, 2003 and signed by William A. Martin, the areas recommended for survey
are "open areas" and areas adjacent to "two-track" roads which provide the greatest
chance for finding intact cultural resources. Four segments of the project area fit this
description on the topographic map. For convenience, these areas are numbered 1-4, and
this is how they are referred to in this report.
Area 1: This area is shown on the topographic map as a two-track road that begins
at State Highway 84 and runs along the east side of County Road 2106 for distance of .4
mile where it ends at a private residence (Figure 2).
Area 2: This area is shown on the topographic map as a two-track road that begins
at the intersection of County Road 1626 and County Road 1627. It runs along the east
side of County Road 1627 for a distance of 1.2 miles. At the end of the road the proposed
water line route traverses .14 mile across a pasture to Beans Creek and FM 2972 (Figure
2).
Area 3: This area is shown on the topographic map as a cross-country segment (.3
mile) that begins at County Road 1701 and ends at the Saint Louis Southwestern Railroad.
It crosses Rogers Creek (Figure 3).
Area 4: This area is shown on the topographic map as a cross-country segment that
began at State Highway 347 between county roads 1723 and 1724 (Figure 3) and runs up
a steep slope in a northwest direction (.3 mile) until it ends at the site of a proposed well
site.

Overall, Cherokee County is located in Northeast Texas in the Eastern Planning
Region, an area known to contain significant archaeological sites. Because of this
archaeological potential, a cultural resource study by professional archaeologists was
warranted according to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The Federal
agency involved in this project is the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural
Development office.
Since this project is sponsored by the Dialville-Oakland WSC, a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, an antiquities permit was required, and Antiquities Permit 3213 was
issued to BVRA by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division. The project
number assigned by BVRA is 03-25. The field survey was conducted on September 4-5,
2003 by Edward P. Baxter under the supervision of William E. Moore, the Principal
Investigator.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Cherokee County is located in Northeast Texas within the Eastern Planning Region
as defined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993). The following comments are taken from their
comprehensive document for this area, and the interested reader is referred to this volume
for more detailed information. As of 1993, Cherokee County had less than .037 recorded
sites per kilometer, ranking it last in the area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.1.2).
The county is described as rural with 0.15 - 0.29 people per square kilometer (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.2.3) and a population growth of less than 5% (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993:Figure 1.2.4). Environmentally, it is situated within the Piney Woods, Mixed
Pine-Hardwood Forest area of East Texas. Artificial disturbance in the county consists
mainly of lignite mines from the Deep Basin Wilcox formation and reservoirs such as Lake
Fork Reservoir. In 1991, the county had a total of 134 recorded archaeological sites, of
which 14 were regarded as significant (kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.1.1). At the
time of this survey, 352 sites were known to exist in the county (TARL site files).
One of the major problems regarding our understanding of the archaeology of
Northeast Texas lies in the lack of data for sites with isolable Paleoindian or Archaic
components. "Despite the existence of a potentially rich data base, the body of useful
information on these time periods is small" (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:70). The authors
credit this to the fact that most early materials have been found mixed with later
components. When found, they are difficult to interpret because of limited absolute dating;
poorly defined artifact chronologies; limited preservation of economic data such as faunal
and botanical remains, and the typically low density nature of the cultural remains. No sites
with isolable Paleoindian or Archaic components have been reported for Cherokee County
as recently as 1993 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.3.1). One site (41CE261)
attributed to the Hunter-Gatherer period (prior to sedentism) has been identified in
Cherokee County (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.3.2). Site 41CE261 is listed as a
possible Archaic site containing faunal remains and a probable midden. One of the
problems with these early sites is that they usually contain only lithic artifacts; rarely, some
sites have yielded hardwood nutshells and burned rock concentrations. "The scarcity of
remains other than lithic artifacts is due mostly to the relatively great age of these deposits
and the poor preservation of organic remains and nondurable features" (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993:75). The minimum criterion for significance of these sites is the presence of
non-artifactual data such as cultural features and faunal and botanical remains and
diagnostic projectile points that allow confident chronological assessments.

5

Following the hunter-gatherer period (circa 500 B.C.), the emergence of sedentism
arrived in Northeast Texas and lasted until A.D. 1000. Sedentism is defined by Kenmotsu
and Perttula (1993:97) as "cultural systems where all or part of the population resides at
the same location for all or most of the year." Until recently, very little research had been
directed toward the emergence of sedentism in Northeast Texas. Factors that are believed
to have been causal in terms of this change include population growth, territorial
constriction, environmental change, technological innovation, modifications in social
organization, and/or changes in subsistence strategies (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:97).
During this time a major technological innovation, the emergence of pottery and the
bow and arrow, appeared. Sites dating to this period are often referred to as Early
Ceramic. The George C. Davis site (41CE19) is one of the major sites of this period in
Cherokee County to be excavated.
The next period is referred to as the development of agriculture in Northeast Texas
before A.D. 1600. Study questions for this period should focus on the processes that
influenced the development of agriculture in Northeast Texas among prehistoric Caddoan
populations with agriculture defined here as a maize-based economy as described in Fritz
(1990). Major sites of this period include Caddoan archaeological sites, particularly
habitation locales with associated burials and burial furniture (usually pottery). More than
4700 prehistoric archaeological sites have been recorded in both the Northeast Texas
region and adjoining counties where associations exist with the Caddoan archaeological
tradition (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:124).
Approximately 80% of the significant sites in this region are prehistoric Caddoan
sites which were occupied sometime between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1600. These sites
include multiple and single mound centers; cemeteries; habitation sites such as villages,
hamlets, and farmsteads; and possible extractive/processing locations. Most of these
sites, unfortunately, are on private land and are not protected from vandalism. Between 5
and 9 important Formative-Middle Caddoan sites were known to exist in Cherokee County
as of 1993 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.1). The number of important Late
Caddoan Period sites as of 1993 for Cherokee County is, however, greater at 30
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.2). In 1993, 39 Caddoan Period archaeological
sites with excellent faunal and floral preservation were known to exist. Although only five
are in Cherokee County (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.3), no county in
Northeast Texas had a higher number at that time.
Cemeteries and burial mounds are
common throughout Northeast Texas, and these archeological phenomena are viewed as
extremely significant research data sets because of the bioarchaeological, cultural, and
sociopolitical information relevant to the development of agriculture encoded in the
mortuary practices, associated grave goods, and pathologies/infections preserved in the
skeletal remains (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:127).
6

In 1993, 21 archaeological sites in Cherokee County had produced human remains
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.5); two single mound sites and one multiple
mound site are recorded in the county (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.6).
Fifty-three Critical Resource Zones have been defined in the Northeast Texas
region for sites that are relevant to the research on the development of agriculture prior to
A.D. 1600. Five of these zones are in Cherokee County (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:Figure 2.5.7). One of these zones is in the southeast portion of the county not far
from the current project area.
The final archaeological period is that of European contact with native Indian
groups, especially the historic Caddo (circa A.D. 1685 - A.D. 1859). The infusion of
material goods and cultural traits brought to the area by the Europeans changed forever
the lifeways of the native Caddoan peoples. At least 89-90 Caddoan sites of this period
are known in Northeast Texas. In Cherokee County, six sites have produced historic
materials in association with native Indian artifacts (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:152).
These include brass bells and European gunflints (41CE6), glass beads and brass tinkler
(41CE12), majolica pottery (41CE19), glass beads (41CE20), 18th century gun found on
the surface (41CE48), and glass beads (41CE293). Two Critical Resource Zones have
been identified for Historic Contact Period sites in Cherokee County. These are Killough
Creek and Bowles Creek (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.6.2). The major historic
Indian groups in Cherokee County in the early 18th Century were probably the Hasinai
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.6.6).
No previous investigations have been conducted in close proximity to the current
project area. The most recent work was a water line survey of 59.44 miles approximately
five miles east of the current project area (Moore 2003). No previously unrecorded sites
were found.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check for previously recorded sites in or near
the project area was conducted by Allegra Azulay at TARL, the state repository for site
records. No previously recorded archaeological sites were found to be within or near the
four survey areas. In addition, relevant reports were checked in order to become familiar
with the kinds of sites known to occur in the area. According to the engineering firm, J. F.
Fontaine & Associates, Inc., the majority of the water line will be placed in disturbed rightsof-way of county and state roads. Four segments (areas 1-4), however, will traverse crosscountry or parallel unimproved, dirt roads. Because of the potential of these areas to
contain archaeological sites in an undisturbed context, the Texas Historical Commission
recommended a professional archaeologist examine these four areas.
The four segments were examined through shovel testing and surface inspection.
All excavated dirt was screened using 1/4" hardware cloth, and a shovel test log was kept
(Appendix I). The approximate location of each test appears on the topographic maps in
Appendix II. In all, 23 shovel tests were excavated to basal clay. Prior to the field survey,
the Principal Investigator reviewed the topographic maps in an attempt to identify high
probability areas for survey. Also, the Principal Investigator visited the project area with the
Project archaeologist in order to help determine the best places for shovel testing within the
four areas selected by the Texas Historical Commission. The Project Archaeologist
excavated all shovel tests. Images of the project area were taken with a digital camera,
notes were taken regarding disturbance in the four areas, and GPS plottings were taken of
shovel test locations for more accurate recording on the topographic maps.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A check of the site records at TARL revealed no sites within 1/2 kilometer of the four
areas surveyed for this project. No archaeological sites or negative surveys were found as
a result of the current project area. The survey areas were found in the field to be different
than represented on the outdated topographic map. Area 1 was found to be a paved road,
not a two-track road. The two-track road at Area 2 was found to be longer than depicted
on the topographic map, making the cross-country shorter than originally thought. The
route in Area 3 was found to be along an eroded area that resembled an old road
depression. At Area 4, the top of the hill (site of the proposed well) had been cleared and
the connecting access road had already been constructed. Overall, not one of the four
survey areas contain deep sandy soils adjacent to streams, the major criterion for
archaeological sites in East Texas. The 23 shovel tests were dug through thin strata of
sand and into basal clay at depths between 10 and 40 cm. Ten of the tests encountered
clay at the surface, and all were terminated at 10 cm or less. It is recommended that
Dialville-Oakland WSC be allowed to proceed with construction as planned without further
consultation by the Texas Historical Commission.
