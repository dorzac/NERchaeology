ABSTRACT
During the middle of May and October of 2007, the City of Coppell in
Dallas County conducted archaeological testing with the Grapevine
Springs Park under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4513 since the City
of Coppell is a political entity of the State of Texas. No diagnostic cultural
materials older than 50 years were found on the ground surface, during the
metal detector survey or uncovered in four test units. The lack of
prehistoric cultural materials was probably a result of terracing and
construction done to create the park by the Works Progress Administration
(WPA). The absence of diagnostic historical cultural materials was the
fact that the park probably was not utilized until well into the 1950s and
probably the 1970s.

INTRODUCTION

During May and October of 2007, residents of the City of Coppell conducted
archaeological testing within the Grapevine Springs Park under the supervision of Jesse
Todd of AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) who acted as Principal Investigator. The purpose of
the archaeological testing was to familiarize the residents of Coppell with Archaeology
ad archaeological methods as part of Archeology Month. Grapevine Springs Park is
located approximately 650 feet south of Rosemount Court and about 1,350 feet west of
Denton Tap Road in Coppell, in northwestern Dallas County, Texas. The investigation
included a pedestrian survey using metal detectors and the excavation of four test pits. A
Principal Investigator and a Texas Antiquities Permit were required because the City of
Coppell is a political entity of the State of Texas and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission issued Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4513 for the
testing.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (ND). The report presents a brief description of the natural setting
of the area, followed by a discussion of the culture history of the surrounding area. A
chapter methodology employed is followed by the results of our investigations.
Conclusions end the report and are followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area lies at the western edge of the Blackland Prairie plant community of
North Central Texas where it interfingers with the Eastern Cross Timbers (Diamond,
Riskind, Orzell 1987: Figure 1). The undivided Upper Cretaceous Eagle Ford group
underlies this entire area from the south edge of the Denton Creek floodplain west to
Grapevine and south to Irving and the valley of the West Fork of the Trinity River
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). Grapevine Creek is incised into the bedrock
formations that include sands, clay, mudstone, gravels, and cemented gravels with
scattered areas of sandstone. The proposed facility is located approximately four and a
half miles from the confluence of Grapevine Creek and the Elm Fork of the Trinity River.
The study area is located within the Wilson-Rader-Axtell Soil Association which consists
of nearly level to gently sloping upland loams (Coffee, Hill and Ressell 1980:General
Soils Map). Specific soils are mapped as Axtell fine sandy loam with 1 to 3 percent
slopes and Silawa fine sandy loam with 2 to 8 percent slopes (Coffee, Hill, and Ressel
1980:1). The deepest subsoil is listed as being 8 inches (20 cm) below the ground surface
and it belongs to the Axtell series (Coffee, Hill and Ressel 1980:55).
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North-Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring and Yates
1997), Humphrey and Ferring (1994), and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations
based on different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on
Ferring’s investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating
periods of rapid alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier
conditions, Ferring has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr BP to the present] was
a wet period with moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000 and 1000 yr
BP [from AD 1 to 1000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol was
established on the stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and its
tributaries. This interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope
analysis. Brown (1998) offers a differing interpretation based on isotopic analyses of
mussel shells from a prehistoric site on Denton Creek. He concludes that the period from
1500 to 2500 yr BP was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after the environment
was warmer and drier, but he points out that this interpretation may only be applicable for
the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The culture history of the Metroplex area has been summarized by various authors
beginning with C.A. Smith (1969), and more recently by Yates and Ferring (1986),
Prikryl (1990), and Peter and McGregor (1988). The following discussion synthesizes
these sources as they relate to the archaeology of the Elm Fork Watershed.
Culture History
The following prehistoric culture history is derived largely from the Elm Fork survey
monograph (Prikryl 1990). We have added a Historic European period.
Paleo-Indian
Archaic
Late Prehistoric
Protohistoric
Historic European

pre-6,500 BC
6,500 BC - AD 700
AD 700 - AD 1600
AD 1600 - AD 1800 [ Historic Native American]
AD 1800 to Present

Using the above temporal framework, the following paragraphs present a brief
description of the culture history of the area.
The Paleoindian period is distinguished by distinctive projectile point styles (Bever and
Meltzer 2007:Table 1). Many of the points are made of exotic cherts that are not native to
North Central Texas. The Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957) anbd the Aubrey
Clovis site (Ferring 2001) in Denton County and the Frognot site (41COL165) in Collin
County are the only excavated Paleoindian sites in the region. Surface artifacts generally
come from deposits on stream terraces above the level of the active floodplain. This was
a period when large mammals became extinct, and their extinction is attributed in part to
a general drying of the environment.
During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream
terraces. There is a hint of population increase and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there
was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. On the Elm Fork,
Prikryl (1990:71) reports fewer bottomland sites than during the previous period. Middle
Archaic sites are predominantly found on the first terrace above stream floodplains. As
earlier, sites tend to be along the Elm Fork rather than along the smaller tributaries. The
population density continued to be low. Late Archaic sites increase in number over the
previous period, and sites are located both along the Elm Fork and its tributaries. There
appears to be a shift in site location to tributary streams, and a pronounced population
explosion. Local Ogallala quartzite is being used prominently at this time, and this
observation is taken by some authors (Skinner 1981; Prewitt 1983) as evidence of
increased territorial constriction.
During the subsequent Late Prehistoric period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in
artifact assemblages (Shafer 1977). Houses and probable evidence of agriculture first
appear during this period, as shown at the Cobb-Pool site on Mountain Creek (Raab and
______________________________________________________________________________________

Woosley 1982), and at site 41DL12, if a mussel-shell hoe indicates farming (Hughes and
Harris 1951). Site locations mirror those of the Late Archaic, and quartzite continues as
the common material for chipped stone projectiles and tools along the Elm Fork. The
West Fork Paleosol is tentatively dated to this period, although it has been dated earlier
that AD 800 in some places. Drying continued into the subsequent period. Buffalo bones
are common in later prehistoric sites (Dillehay 1974; Lynott 1979), and along with tools
normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains. It also appears that sites are once
again located on sandy terraces above the floodplains.
Historic Native Americans are reported in Dallas County by numerous authors. Very
little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been found in
the area. This is a pattern seen throughout much of North-Central Texas (Skinner 1988;
Peter, Cliff, and Green 1996:3).

The Anglo-American history of the Upper Trinity River Basin has been divided into the
Frontier, Initial Cash Crop, Tenant Farming, and Agribusiness periods by Richner and
Lee (1976:125-133). The Frontier period lasted from about 1820 to 1850 and was
followed by the Initial Cash Crop period which lasted until 1870. Tenant Farming began
at 1870 and continued to about 1940. Agribusiness began after the Great Depression and
continues to the present.
Previous Investigations
The history of Grapevine Springs Park (41DL329) is well documented in a report by
Green, Lorrain, and Lorrain (1994) and the reader is referred to that report for details.
With claims as an important Sam Houston camp site where a treaty was signed,
construction of a formal park by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) was begun in
1936-1937. The State of Texas refused to accept the area as a state park after research
indicated the treaty was signed by Sam Houston at Bird’s Fort. Dallas County accepted
responsibility for maintenance and it became a county park. The start of World War II
diverted funds to maintain the park, and it reverted to the original owners who leased it
for agricultural use until the early 1950s. Based on plans for a highway loop that would
pass near Grapevine Springs Park, a Dallas real estate developer purchased the property
and proposed to build an amusement park. However, when the City of Dallas abandoned
plans for the highway, development of the park ceased. In the 1970s, the park was given
to the Baptist Foundation, and in 1991 the Baptist Foundation donated 15 acres of the site
to Dallas County with the City of Coppell providing maintenance.
A portion of the park area was investigated by AR Consultants (Trask and Skinner 2000).
Results of the survey included increasing the park by another three acres.
Recommendations included that the two stone pillars associated with the west entrance to
the park be restored.

METHODOLOGY
Two methods were utilized in the testing of the park. First, various areas were cordoned
off and possible artifact locations were investigated by people walking in parallel
transects about 2 m apart using metal detectors. Transects were oriented to fit the
individual survey area. Artifact locations were flagged in each area and a map of the
artifact concentrations was made.
On the return visit, four 1x1 meter test units were placed in the artifact concentrations in
four separate areas. Test units were excavated in 10 cm levels and artifacts were bagged
according to test unit and level. Sheets were filled out for each level. Soil from the test
units was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth shaker screen. Photographs also
were taken.
No artifacts were curated due to their either being less than 50 years old.

RESULTS
The following discussion presents a brief description of our findings. The metal detector
survey is described first and followed by a discussion of the excavation of the test units.
Conclusions derived from the testing end the chapter.
Metal detector survey
On May 12, 2007, various residents of Coppell gathered at the entrance to Grapevine
Springs Park. They were divided into groups and captains for each group were chosen for
the metal detector surveys of various areas in the park. An overall map of the park
(Figure 2) presents the various areas examined during the metal detector survey. Each
metal detector group was escorted by members of the Dallas Archeological Society
(DAS) and AR Consultants, Inc.
The surveyors walked various oriented transects spaced approximately 2 m apart with the
metal detector as shown in Figure 3. Hits were flagged (Figure 4) and then concentrations
were mapped. No testing was done at the time. An example of the artifact concentration
maps is shown as Figure 5.
Testing
As previously stated, four test units were excavated (Figure 6). Two test units (TUs 1 and
2) were placed away from Grapevine Creek where numerous hits from the metal detector
had been made and two (TUs 3 and 4) were placed adjacent to Grapevine Creek. The
loamy clay was removed by using trowels and shovels. It was intended to screen the
loamy clay matrix but this was not done due to the hardness of the soil matrices but the
sandy loam was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth screen.
Test Unit 1 was excavated to 20 cm below the ground surface. The soil consisted of dark
grayish-brown (10YR4/2) sandy loam. The first level (0-10 cm) was culturally sterile but
a bone fragment and a metal nut were recovered from the second level (10-20 cm). None
of these were considered older than 50 years.
The upper 10 cm of Test Unit 2 consisted of brown (10YR4/3) sandy loam and from 10
to 20 cm below the ground surface consisted of very dark grayish-brown sandy loam. The
crew is shown excavating the test unit in Figure 7. Seven eroded wire nails were
recovered in the upper 10 cm level. Charcoal also was encountered but was too dispersed
to be collected. Fourteen very eroded wire nail and nail fragments and a piece of metal of
an unknown function were recovered from level 2 (10-20 cm) None of the artifacts
recovered were over 50 years old.
Test Unit 3 was excavated to 22 cm below the ground surface before being terminated
due to encountering impenetrable gravel. The soil matrix was brown (10YR4/3) loamy
clay containing limestone gravel. No cultural materials were found.

Test Unit 4 was excavated to 40 cm below the ground surface. The upper soil horizon
consisted of very dark grayish-brown (10YR3/2) loamy clay. The bottom zone consisted
of brown (10YR4/3) slightly loamy clay. No cultural materials were uncovered.

Conclusions
No cultural materials older than 50 years were uncovered during the archaeological
testing within the Grapevine Springs Park. Although a spring is present, no prehistoric
cultural materials were discovered and this may be a result of the terracing and
construction done to create the park by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The
absence of diagnostic historical cultural materials may be attributed to the fact that the
park probably was not utilized well into the 1950s and probably the 1970s.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the results of the surveys conducted by Green, Lorrain and Lorrain (1997)
and AR Consultants (Trask and Skinner 2000) and the results of this investigation, it
appears that the park has a low potential of containing both prehistoric and historic
cultural materials. We do recommend that the WPA structures be stabilized and
preserved.
