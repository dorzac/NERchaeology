ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of two borrow pit areas (41.3 acres) in southeast
Jefferson County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) on September 30, 2006 and October 14, 2006. This investigation involved
a 100% Pedestrian Survey using metal detectors and shovel testing and an
examination of exposed soil profiles created by heavy equipment during previous
sand removal at Tract 1 (Gabby’s Pit). The entire project area is located on a
Chenier Ridge that overlooks the Gulf of Mexico to the south. This ridge is part of a
beach system that is described as Quaternary Continental, and it dates to the
Pleistocene Epoch. The shovel testing revealed firm clay at the surface and a lens
of “shell hash” between 35 cm and 45 cm at Tract 1 and 70 cm and 90 cm at Tract
3. This shell represents the remains of an ancient beach. No prehistoric or historic
sites were identified, and no artifacts were collected.

INTRODUCTION
In order to construct the Golden Pass LNG facility at another location in
the county, Remedial Services, LP needs to borrow sand from two pits (Tract 1
and Tract 3) in southeast Jefferson County, Texas (Figure 1). Sand will be
removed by heavy equipment to a depth of 15 feet and transported by truck to
the construction site. The project area is depicted on the USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangle Sabine Pass (2993-323) dated 1957 and photorevised in 1970
(Figure 2). The location of these tracts is about 150 meters north of State
Highway 87, 1800 meters east-southeast of Knight Lake, and approximately five
miles west of Sabine Pass, Texas. The entire project area is on private property.
Therefore, this project does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Texas Historical
Commission. Because the project area is not located within an area containing
wetlands, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District is not
involved. Tract 1 is referred to as Gabby’s Pit. It is 13.8 acres (600 x 1000 feet).
Tract 3 is referred to as the Doornbos Pit. It is (27.5 acres (600 x 2000 feet).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general statements regarding the environment of Jefferson
County were taken from the soil survey for Jefferson County by Crout et al. (1965)
and the Texas Almanac (Kingston and Harris 1985). This county is located in the
extreme eastern part of Texas. The landscape ranges from the high ground on the
west bank of the Neches River in the eastern part of Jefferson County to a low
marshy area along the coast. The borrow pit is located along a Chenier Ridge, a
stranded sand beach in a marshland environment. These ancient beaches were
originally formed along the seashore, and they indicate a former coastline. These
ridges often support trees such as pines or evergreen oaks. The vegetation in the
project area is dominated by facultative upland species. In this area it consists
mainly of grasses. Figure 3 illustrates the undisturbed terrain at Tract 1. According
to the soil survey for Jefferson County (Crout et al. 1965:Sheet 69), the project area
(Tract 1) is located in Sabine loamy fine sand (SA) soils, and Tract 3 is located in
Harris Clay (HS) soils (Figure 4).
Harris Clay soils consist of about 12 to 30 inches of clay underlain by 3 to 4
feet of fine sand. The parent material is clayey old alluvium and marine sediments
deposited over sandy material. This is a saline soil that is very poorly drained, and
it occurs in level positions 1 to 4 feet above sea level
Sabine loamy fine sand consists of about 5 feet of loamy fine sand
developed from sandy marine deposits. It is a well-drained soil on slopes of
dominantly less than 1 percent but as much as 2 percent. A stratification containing
shell fragments is common at 40 inches or more.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
General
According to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Jefferson County is
situated within the Southeast Texas Archeological Study Region. It is in the
Southeast Texas Cultural-geographical region as defined by Biesaart et al.
(1985:Figure 15). When the statistical overview was published by Biesaart et al.
in 1985, there were 1630 recorded archaeological sites in the region – 8.06% of
the state. In 1985, Jefferson County had 46 known sites – 2.82% of the region
and .23% of the state. Today, there are at least 80 recorded archaeological sites
in the county (TARL files). In 1985, two sites were listed as Paleo-Indian, six
sites were listed as Archaic, and forty-two sites were listed as Late Prehistoric.
Site disturbance was common and consisted of erosion (36 sites), construction
(22 sites), vandalism (8 sites), and deflated and dispersed soils (9 sites). Five
sites were described as destroyed. Two sites had been excavated, four sites
had been tested by hand, two sites had been tested by machine, and thirty-seven
sites were reported to have been surface collected. Shell middens represented
the most common type of prehistoric site (n=39), and burials were found at five
sites. Major threats to sites in this area are population increase, oil and gas
production, and some timber exploitation in inland areas.
Previous Investigations
The first systematic efforts at locating and recording cultural resources in
Jefferson County occurred in 1940-1941 when G. E. Arnold of the University of
Texas surveyed portions of Jefferson and Orange counties. This work was
conducted under the auspices of the Work Projects Administration (WPA) and the
University of Texas at Austin.
Arnold succeeded in recording 23 sites
(41JF1-41JF23) during this time. Except for a minor historic component at 41JF16,
all are prehistoric sites such as camps or shell middens. At three sites (41JF10,
41JF18, 41JF20) burials have been reported. No formal report was written by
Arnold and the only documentation of his work exists in TARL records and a thesis
by Hyo-Jai Im (1975).
No additional sites were added to the record until the 1960s when ten
prehistoric sites were recorded, primarily through the efforts of a local avocational,
Charles N. Bollich, who personally recorded eight sites (41JF27-41JF34).
The Gaulding site (41JF27), selected by the Texas Archeological Society for
the third annual field school, was excavated by its members in 1965. This
represents the first site in Jefferson County to be formally excavated. Gaulding is a
Late Prehistoric site with a deep (1.2 m) shell midden containing a flexed burial,
pottery, arrow points, dart points, and faunal remains of turtle and alligator
(Richmond, Richmond, and Greer 1985:Table 2, 133-134). The results of this
project have yet to be published.
7

The only accounts of Gaulding is a paper presented to the Society by Bollich
(1965), a short article authored by E. Mott Davis (1965), a review of TAS field
schools (Richmond, Richmond, and Greer 1985), and TARL site records.
In addition to Gaulding, at least two prehistoric sites have been tested.
Sites 41JF26 and 41JF31, pimple mound earth middens, were tested by Aten and
Bollich (1981). Data from these sites have not been formally published (Aten
1983:202).
Only one historic site has been excavated in Jefferson County. Site 41JF46,
the 19th Century home and trading post of John J. French was investigated by THC
in 1975. No formal report has been written documenting this work, but notes are on
file at the Beaumont Heritage Society.
In the vicinity of the project area, a series of fortifications dating to the Civil
War (Fort Mannahasset) were recorded by Wayne Roberson for the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department in 1974. At the time of his visit, the following features were
observed: two redoubts, two redans, and one lunette. This site (41JF45) covered
an area of about ¾ mile along the sandy ridge. At the time of his visit, the site was
being looted by local collectors.
Seventeen sites (41JF25, 41JF35-41JF50) were recorded in the 1970s
while 15 (41JF51-41JF65) were recorded in the 1980s. Numerous small surveys
conducted by private contractors and federal and state agencies such as the United
States Corps of Engineers (COE), the Texas Archeological Salvage Project
(TASP), Texas Archeological Survey (TAS), Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
(TPWD), and the Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
(TSDHPT), have been conducted in the county. Most of these endeavors have
resulted in negative findings. A comprehensive listing of work done in the county is
contained in a recent bibliography published by THC (Moore 1989).
Larger surveys conducted in the county which resulted in new site
recordings include an assessment of sites in the Taylors Bayou River Drainage by
TASP (Aten 1972) in which one site (41JF35) was located; a cultural resources
survey of the Big Hill Storage Complex Pipeline by Coastal Environments (Pearson
et al. 1982) which located one site (41JF60); a survey of the Jefferson County
Beach Park site by TPWD (Lorrain 1973) which resulted in six new sites
(41JF37-41JF42); a study of prehistoric and historic resources along the Lower
Sabine and Neches rivers by TAS (McGuff and Roberson 1974) which produced
two new sites (41JF43-41JF44); and a survey of the proposed Neches River
saltwater barrier and discharge canal near Beaumont by the Research Institute,
Northeast Louisiana University, (Heartfield and Madden 1981) which documented
five historic shipwrecks (41JF55-41JF59).

Several syntheses and overviews of Southeast Texas and the Upper Texas
Coast have been written by a number of researchers. Notable among these are
three works by Aten which include his unpublished Ph.D. dissertation (Aten 1979a),
a report for TASP (Aten 1979b), and a scholarly book (Aten 1983). In addition, he
authored an article about determining seasonality of Rangia cuneata from Gulf
Coast shell middens (Aten 1981) and co-authored two articles with Charles N.
Bollich discussing a ceramic chronology for the Sabine Lake area of Texas and
Louisiana (Aten and Bollich 1969) and archeological evidence for pimple mound
genesis (Aten and Bollich 1981). Other works include efforts by Patterson (1979,
1985, 1987) and Shafer (1975).
Several bibliographies relevant to the area have been published.
include a recent comprehensive work for the Southeastern Region of
published by the THC (Moore 1989), a bibliography of historical sites in
(Moore and Moore 1986), and numerous versions of a bibliography of the
Texas Coast by Leland W. Patterson.

At least four histories of Jefferson County have been published. They are a
history from Wilderness to Reconstruction (Block 1976), the history and progress of
Jefferson County (East 1961), first settlers of Jefferson County (White 1984), and a
volume by Adams (1971). Other works germane to the area include WPA
guidebooks to Beaumont (Federal Writers' Project n.d.) and Texas (Federal Writers'
Project 1986), a cultural geography of Texas (Meining 1988), a book of family
profiles (1840-1900) compiled by the History Research Department, Jefferson
Carnegie Library (1981) which includes Jefferson County, and a review of Texas
Indians (Newcomb 1986).

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL were checked for the
presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area and
vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work in Jefferson County
were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic
sites found in the area. Avocational archaeologist Charles N. Bollich who has
considerable experience in this part of Texas was consulted regarding sites along
Chenier ridges in Jefferson County. Based on the presence of a Civil War
fortification in the area (41JF45), it seemed possible that additional evidence dating
to this period may be present at one or more of the two tracts. Since prehistoric
sites are known to occur on Chenier ridges, the project area was viewed by BVRA
as a possible setting for an aboriginal site.
Field Survey
The field survey was performed by a 100% Pedestrian Survey of the two
tracts. This investigation was conducted through a visual inspection of the surface,
shovel testing, and use of a metal detector. All excavated earth removed as a
result of shovel testing was screened through quarter-inch hardware cloth. Data
obtained from shovel tests were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I). In all,
19 shovel tests were excavated at the two tracts. All shovel tests were backfilled
after evaluation and mapping, and the location of each test was plotted on a field
map (Figures 5 and 6). These figures are an enlargement of the areas depicted
above in Figure 2. Photographs of the project area were taken with a digital
camera.
Tract 1
The field survey of Tract 1 (Gabby’s Pit) was conducted on September 30,
2006 under the supervision of James E. Warren (Project Archaeologist) with a field
crew of two persons. This tract is 600 x 1000 feet in size (13.8 acres) along a
Chenier Ridge approximately seven feet above the surrounding marsh. Vegetation
in this area is dominated by facultative upland species. At the time of this study,
removal of sand had already begun along the northern margin of the pit, and
clearing had been conducted south of the active borrow pit. The area had been
surveyed and staked. Nine shovel tests were excavated in the undisturbed portion
– approximately one-third of the site. These tests were dug through firm clay and
terminated when a “shell hash” was reached at 35 cm to 45 cm below the surface.
This shell layer represents an ancient beach. The profiles created by previous
sand removal were thoroughly inspected, and a map of the north wall profile was
drawn in the field (Figure 7) and photographed (Figure 8). Previous disturbance at
this tract is illustrated in Figure 9.

Tract 3
The field survey of Tract 3 (Doornbos Pit) was conducted on October 14,
2006 under the supervision of James E. Warren (Project Archaeologist) with a field
crew of two persons. This tract is 600 x 2000 feet in size (13.8 acres) and is
located along a Chenier Ridge approximately seven feet above the surrounding
marsh. Vegetation in this area is dominated by facultative upland species. At the
time of this survey no sand removal had occurred. The area was mowed but not
staked and flagged. Ten shovel tests were excavated. These tests were dug
through firm clay and clay before encountering a lens of shell hash between 80 cm
and 90 cm below the surface. Shovel tests 1 and 2 were dug at either end of the
tract to confirm the continuity of a shell hash along this portion of the ridge. These
tests were profiled in the field. Because no evidence of a prehistoric site beneath
the shell hash was observed in the profile at Tract 1 and Tract 3 appears to be in a
similar topographic setting, use of a backhoe to evaluate beneath the shell hash
was not considered necessary. It is not likely that an intact site would be present
on a beach. The profiles of shovel tests 1 and 2 are illustrated in Figure 10.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no archaeological
sites have been recorded in the project area. According to Charles N. Bollich, a
prehistoric site is present on a Chenier Ridge approximately two miles west of the
town of Sabine Pass. Mr. Bollich obtained this information from a local collector,
but he has not been able to confirm its exact location. Based on this personal
communication and the known use of this ridge in early historic times, the tracts to
be investigated were considered by BVRA to be high probability areas for a
prehistoric or historic site. According to the site records at TARL, one historic site
(41JF45), fortifications dating to the Civil War, was found to be present to the west
of the project area and on the same ridge. Based on this information, BVRA
considered the tracts to be investigated high probability areas for the presence of a
historic site, possibly dating to the Civil War period or earlier. Site 41JF45 was
originally recorded by Wayne Roberson in 1974 following testing in 1972 and 1973
No evidence of a prehistoric site was found during the surface inspection,
shovel testing, or examination of exposed bank profiles created by sand removal at
Tract 1. The exposed profile (Figures 6 and 7) revealed 25 cm of very firm clay
mixed with broken shell to be the first stratum overlying the sand being borrowed
for construction purposes. BVRA believes the shell hash in this stratum represents
an ancient beach. It is unlikely that there would be an intact site on the beach due
to the constant wave action that would have been present. Such sites are probably
further inland where the soil was deeper and more stable. The shell hash is deeper
(80-90 cm) at Tract 3, but no cultural materials or features were observed in the
sandy beach soil between the clay and the shell. Since no evidence of a prehistoric
site was found in the deep sand at Tract 1, excavation with a backhoe was not
considered necessary at Tract 3.

17

RECOMMENDATIONS
BVRA conducted an archaeological survey of two borrow pit areas along a
Chenier Ridge overlooking a marshy area adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. No
prehistoric sites were found, and no evidence of historic utilization of the project
area was observed at either tract. Should evidence of an archaeological site be
encountered during sand removal, it is recommended that construction stop until
the situation can be evaluated by a professional archaeologist. It is also
recommended that any additional borrow areas be examined prior to sand removal.

APPENDIX II
E-MAIL FROM WAYNE R. ROBERSON TO WILLIAM E. MOORE
REGARDING FORT MANAHASSET
DATED OCTOBER 4, 2006*

A good background piece is the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
(TPWD) Archeological Report Number 8, Sabine Pass Battleground State
Historic Park by Terri Holzapple and Wayne Roberson (Antiquities Permit 21).
Holzapple did the compilation and layout and other tasks. David Ing did a major
part of the editing. I signed the Antiquities Permit, did the historic research, and
used old maps to triangulate possible locations of the original Confederate fort.
Dessamae Lorraine and a field crew performed testing in 1972. Then,
David Ing and I tested in 1973. Finally, a small crew and I (cited in the
Acknowledgments) tested again in 1974. Our 1974 tests were in the traditional
place where the fort was said to be. Following our testing, I was convinced that
the true site (or what is left of it) is beneath the United States Coast Guard station
– and this is reflected in the conclusions that I wrote. The Spanish colonizers
and their Catholic Corps capped every known native religious site with a church
or destroyed the site if they could. The United States Army and their Corps of
Engineers did virtually the same with things Native American or Confederate, and
they probably wiped out most of Fort Sabine. In the report (pp. 33 and 35) are
figures of period maps of Sabine Pass and the Fort Sabine redoubts and
associated earthworks. At the very bottom of those maps (maybe 7 miles to the
southwest) is a similar array of redoubts: Fort Manhasset.
At the beginning of my short tenure at TPWD (1973-1976) as head of the
Archeology Section, there was an on-going project to ascertain and decide the
priority of lands and other properties to be purchased for parks and prehistoric
and historic sites over the following several years. That was when money for
buying parks came from State cigarette taxes, and there was plenty of it. I
argued unsuccessfully with the agency’s historian that Fort Manhasset was a
major historic site, and that it should be on the list of properties for purchase. It
was, I argued (based on my brief research), the only remaining site that still held
undisturbed and undetonated Confederate ordinance.

I believe this is still true because the remains of the fort were on private
property, and this may still be the case. The State Archeologist (Curtis Tunnell)
visited the site following a phone call that someone was excavating one of the
redoubts with a backhoe. Curtis drove there immediately, and his boss (Truett
Lattimer – Director of the Texas State Historical Survey Commission (later to
become the Texas State Historical Commission) arrived later.
Curtis tried to persuade the man from digging into the site with a backhoe
and destroying the site. The digger claimed to be the landowner. The digger
chided Curtis saying he was just trying to get the site for himself. When the
digger’s backhoe bucket exposed some unexploded ordinance, Curtis persuaded
the digger to witness a demonstration of the potential danger to the digger and
his backhoe. Curtins carried one of the cannonballs a short distance away and
cut a hole in the bomb’s lead plug. Then he removed some crystalline granules
and ignited them. The powder (100 years old!) ignited with an impressive loud
burst of flame and smoke. The landowner climbed onto his backhoe and drove
away.
