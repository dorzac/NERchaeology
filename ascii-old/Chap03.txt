Chapter 3: Excavation and Analysis Methods

INTRODUCTION
The chief purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the excavation
methods and of the provenience units from which different kinds of samples were drawn.
The actual details of analysis for the various classes of data will be found in their
respective chapters or appendices.
Fieldwork objectives: how they structured results
It is important to understand that the original objective of excavation in the bench
deposits was simply to assess the extent and significance of cultural remains buried in the
bench sediments. This was explicitly stated in the contract amendment under which the
UTSA-CAR crew was dispatched to the site in November, 1979. The contract was for
three weeks of field investigation with a four-person crew. The initial arrangement with
the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority actually stated that the CAR was to provide a
statement in advance of "expected findings" and that if these were not met after one
week, the remaining two weeks of investigation were to be cancelled (letter of October
23, 1979, John H. Specht to Thomas R. Hester). This arrangement was later modified to
allow the project to run its full extent. About 22 days were spent in the field with varying
numbers of paid crew members, and I spent about another two weeks at the site alone or
with volunteer workers. Although the bench excavations were a separate project from the
main block excavations that took place the preceding summer, I strove to maintain
continuity in the grid and elevation systems, feature numbering, and film roll numbering.

The paleoenvironmental emphasis of the present study is almost entirely post hoc,
and is possible only because the standard archeological field practice of the time included
accurate profiling of vertical exposures and generous collection of matrix samples. Many
of the analyses that have been done were not yet envisioned when the samples were
collected in the field. The original budget allowed for radiocarbon assays and phytolith
analysis, plus very limited funds for a field geologist, faunal analysis, soil analysis, and
malacological analysis.

However, it is important to recognize that because the original rationale of the
project was not explicitly paleoenvironmental in nature, some important pieces of
information were never collected. In general, our view of the bench sediments was too
spatially restricted. There are two key areas where this was the case. In subsequent
chapters, I will argue that the most important visible environmental change in the early
history of Berger Bluff is the dramatic change in depositional style at the top of the bench
deposits. Unfortunately, in large part because the contract specified that we investigate
only the bench sediments, I have no samples that span this important transition. We know
a great deal now about what preceded this transition, but can infer only from visual
observation of the bluff what came after.

A second example pertains to the nature of the banded sediments visible in the
cutbank. In order to evaluate their origin, we need to know how laterally extensive they
are. Backhoe trenching on the opposite side of the valley, in the vicinity of 41 VT 49-51,
might have helped to clarify this matter, but was clearly beyond the scope of the contract.
In lieu of this, we can rely only on the cutbank exposures downvalley from the bench
area. Put

more

succinctly,

an explicitly geoarcheological approach to the bench
363

excavations, had circumstances allowed it, would have examined a much wider area, both
horizontally and vertically.

An explicitly geoarcheological approach would also probably have included some
oriented sediment samples for micromorphological sectioning. During the fieldwork, I
considered collecting a profile monolith, but did not have the necessary supplies on hand,
and did not do so. Un-oriented micromorphological samples were later extracted from
bags of loose matrix, and these have proved very informative, but oriented samples
would have been even more useful.

Despite the post hoc reorientation of the present study, the site remains one of the
most important sources of paleoenvironmental data on the central part of the Texas
coastal plain. Archeological sites are customarily regarded as poor sources of
environmental indicators because humans tend to modify their microhabitats extensively,
but it is clear from the archeological evidence that humans had very limited impact on the
site until much later in the Holocene. The earliest uses of the site were essentially nonresidential, and it is not until the late Holocene that occupation density and frequency
increased to the point that anthropogenic modification of the deposits became
pronounced.
FIELD METHODS

Grid system
Excavation began with an arbitrary grid system and arbitrary elevation datum
(designated 100.00 meters) already established by David Brown for his blufftop
364

excavations in the summer of 1979. This grid was projected onto the bench before
excavation was begun, and a secondary datum was also set up at the northwest end of the
bench. A transit was set up over the northeast corner stake (N103/E100) of the blufftop
excavation block, and was aligned on the southeast corner stake; grid north was found to
lie at N 4Â° 39' W, or slightly to the west of magnetic north. This grid north was retained
for the bench project. A north-south E100 grid line was laid out on the sloping bench
surface, and a known point (N105) on this line was plumbed from the blufftop. The rest
of the grid system was projected from this point using the transit and a steel tape. The
unevenly sloping bench topography made frequent use of a plumb line necessary for
accurate location of grid points.

All excavation units are one-meter squares, named by the north and east
coordinates of the southwest corner, except Unit 2, a one-meter square excavated the
previous summer but not aligned with the grid.

In addition to the bench excavations, of course, Area A has the 3 x 4 m excavation
block dug in the summer of 1979, plus a 2 x 2 m test pit (1A) and six shovel tests dug in
1977. Area B has a 1 x 1 m test pit and five shovel tests dug in 1977, plus four backhoe
trenches dug in 1983. There are also four backhoe trenches and five shovel tests outside
the recognized surface limits of areas A and B. None of these are of direct concern here.
Elevation control
The primary datum for excavations at Berger Bluff was a 60-penny nail driven by
David Brown into a tree northwest of the blufftop excavation block in the summer of
1979. I would estimate it rested perhaps 50-60 cm above the ground surface, but due to
365

the creekward slope of the terrain, the top of this nail, assigned an arbitrary elevation of
100.00 m, was at the same elevation as the southwest corner (N97 E96) of the excavation
block (D. Brown 1983:16). During that project, I measured the elevation of the hearth
(Feature 5) exposed near the bench surface. Using a transit to run a combination stadia
rod and steel tape traverse from the primary datum down to the exposed surface, I
estimated the surface of the hearth at 92.355 m (field notes, June 29, 1979).

The primary datum has now been lost due to wave action from the reservoir.
Recognizing the impending removal of the datum, on April 17, 1981, I returned to the
site with Joan DeCosta and set two new datum points (steel rebar in concrete) south of
the blufftop excavation block, at N90.5 E96 and N82 E96. The first of these was set at an
even elevation point.

At the outset of the bench excavations, I set a secondary datum at 93.50 m (see
Fig. 3.1 for location) on the bench near the upper contact of stratum 3, west of the
excavations. At the time, I could not locate the primary datum, and instead I measured
from a profile pin (92.50 m) near N100 E96 (field notes of November 26, 1979). A
traverse was run to a temporary stake on the bluff edge west of the bench, then a steel
tape was dropped six meters to set a piece of one-inch steel rebar in concrete at the
appropriate elevation. When the traverse was rechecked (several times) three days later, it
was found to be 14 cm in error, so it was reset, then all subsequent elevation
measurements for the bench were established using the 93.50 m secondary datum. A
transit recheck of the highest elevation on the surface of the hearth (Feature 5) made on
December 30, 1979, gave an elevation of 92.375 m, which is in close agreement with the
traverse made the previous summer. Since the instrument HI was taken from the
366

secondary datum, this supports the accuracy of the secondary datum. The secondary
datum was used to obtain daily instrument HI readings that were used for plane table
mapping, excavation level checks, and for setting profile pins.

Excavation units
Aside from the original Unit 2, seven 1 x 1 m excavation units were dug into the
bench (Figs. 3.1 to 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6). Including Unit 2, these represent a total of 6.76 m3
of fill. Three units (N109 E103, N110 E102, and N111 E101) were dug near the cutbank
so the stratigraphy could be correlated with the cutbank profile. The second of these is the
deepest and has the most complete stratigraphic section, and is the primary data column
for sampling such things as sediments, diatoms, pollen, and so forth. Three more (N112
E99, N113 E98, and N112 E97) were dug near the hearth. A seventh unit (N109 E96,
Fig. 3.7) was dug near the base of the bluff so that variability in the deposits away from
the longitudinal axis of the creek could be observed. In order to lay out this unit, a large
area of fill (mostly slump deposits and stratum 3) was shoveled out and discarded
without screening, down to a floor resting at about 93.04-93.15 m (Figs. 3.1, 3.8).
Although not by design, the coordinate easting for the southwest corner of each unit is
unique, so that if necessary, the individual units can be designated by easting as follows:
E96, Unit 2, E97, E98, E99, E101, E102, and E103.
Excavation methods
Before excavation began, both the toe (talus) slope and the bench surface were
littered with firecracked rock, chipping debris, mussel shells, and snail shells, most of
which derived from the Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations near the top of the
bluff. Much of this was raked away at the outset, but before excavation began in each
square, loose sand and intrusive cultural debris were carefully troweled and brushed away
until the hard, cemented bench surface was fully exposed. Transit readings on the initial
sloping surface were recorded in each corner, and additional elevations were recorded on
sketch maps of units crossed by small gullies.
371

Excavations were done in 5 cm arbitrary levels, since stratigraphic boundaries
were too diffuse to recognize while digging. The initial level in a unit was generally
wedge-shaped in section as a result of the northeastward slope of the bench surface. The
depth of the first level was usually adjusted so that the level floor extended completely
across the unit. In the most extreme case, the first level was 39 cm thick in one corner. In
two units, the second level was 10 cm thick. Table 3.1 shows all levels and their
estimated volumes. One unit (N113 E98) was dug hurriedly on April 16-17, 1980, just
before the rising reservoir covered the bench. The purpose of the unit was to search for
additional

14

C samples associated with the mussel shell-bearing surface at the base of

stratum 2A, and because of time limits, abbreviated excavation techniques were used: 10
cm levels were dug until the surface was approached at 92.20 m, then the last 10 cm were
removed as two 5 cm levels (Table 3.1).

A transit was used for elevation control â that is, for checking level floors,
measuring the elevation of objects found in situ, and setting pins in walls for profile
stringlines. An effort was made to locate and record as much cultural debris as possible in
place. Objects such as chert flakes, small bits of charcoal, mussel shells, bones, and
possible manuports (pebbles that appeared too large to have been water-deposited) were
drawn on a level plan and given individual item numbers where necessary, and an
elevation was recorded for the surface on which the object was resting. Fill was dry
screened through 1/4" mesh hardware cloth. Anything retained on the screen was saved,
including artifacts, baked clay fragments, bone fragments, snails, hackberry seeds,
charcoal, fossil wood, chert pebbles, rhizoconcretions, irregular calcareous aggregates,
ferromanganese concretions, and Goliad sandstone clasts. All of this material was later
sorted and weighed or counted. Unit N113 E98 represents an exception to this procedure;
snails, concretions, fossil wood, and clastic material were not collected from the screen in
this one unit (a small collection of snails was picked in the lab from a bone deposit matrix
sample). Excavation was done with shovels, except when special care in exposing a
feature or an artifact, or cleaning a profile wall or floor was necessary.
Preventing contamination
Contamination (objects introduced by accident into an unrelated context) is not
ordinarily a major concern in most archeological excavations, but in the bench deposits,
cultural debris was so sparse that almost any degree of contamination was regarded as
unacceptable. Some special measures were taken to prevent contamination. Slump
deposits were carefully removed from the bench before excavation. Smoking was
banned, to prevent contamination of radiocarbon samples. One recurrent problem was
that the area reserved for screening was muddy with discarded slump debris, and quite a
375

few small flakes from the blufftop deposits were present. To prevent these being tracked
into active units, burlap bag "doormats" were provided for each unit, and excavators were
asked to wipe their feet before entering the unit. Wet screening was not done during the
bench excavations, so there was no possibility of bedload material being introduced from
a pump intake (as in the blufftop excavations the previous summer).
Matrix ("constant volume") samples
During the excavation of each level, a block of fill approximately 25 cm square
was left standing in the southwest corner to be collected as a general-purpose matrix
sample. These generally amounted to about two or three liters in volume, averaging about
2.5-3.0 kg in weight when dried. Matrix samples spanned the entire thickness of levels
greater than 5 cm, with the width of the column reduced accordingly so as to keep the
volume roughly constant. Samples were collected in double paper bags, which allowed
the sediment to dry without the addition of any fungicides.

In retrospect, a better plan might have been to collect the matrix as a column
sample from the profile of the completed pit. That method allows for subdivision of
samples into smaller units, makes it possible to avoid crosscutting stratum boundaries,
and eliminates the possibility of forgetting to collect a sample. On the other hand, large
column samples like these are difficult to extract from dry pit walls.

In the laboratory, matrix samples from two units (N109 E96 and N110 E102)
were subsampled for grain-size analysis and then the remainder of the sample was
washed through graduated geologic sieves to extract snails (details of the procedure can
be found in Chapter 8). Four matrix samples supplied sediment for radiocarbon assay of
376

sediment organics. Un-oriented peds or sediment aggregates were extracted from matrix
sample bags (N111 E101) for micromorphological studies, since no oriented samples
were collected in the field.
Pollen/phytolith samples
Small sediment samples that could be used either for pollen or phytolith analysis
were collected from the top of each matrix block before it was bagged. No phytolith
analysis has been done, but one column of pollen samples (all from N110 E102, except
for one sample from N109 E103) was analyzed by Richard Holloway, with the excess
sample portions returned for curation.

Although these samples were intended as general-purpose pollen or phytolith
samples, some of them were later subsampled for diatom analysis, magnetic
susceptibility, and soil lipid analysis as well.

The collection protocol for these "phytopol" samples was as follows:

1) Approximately a centimeter of fill was troweled off the surface of the matrix block to
expose a fresh surface;

2) The trowel to be used for collection was washed in distilled water;

3) The sample was collected from a thin layer, ideally no more than a centimeter thick,
and placed in a plastic bag which was immediately sealed;

377

4) Samples were not treated with phenol or other fungicides. Instead, the tail of the
plastic bag was loosely wrapped around the sample, which was secured and placed in
a labeled paper bag. This kind of closure was intended to allow enough ventilation for
moisture to escape very slowly, yet prevent contamination by airborne pollen.
These "phytopol" samples are therefore derived from the upper 2 cm (or less) of a
5 cm level, and most of the remainder of the matrix sample is generally derived from the
lower 3 cm. Figure 3.4 is a schematic drawing showing the relative vertical position of
the different kinds of samples. In the case of 10 cm levels, one sample was collected from
the top of the level and another from the midpoint (except in N113 E98, where only the
top sample was collected). These supplementary samples are as follows:
N110 E102 92.90-92.80 (upper at about 92.89, lower at about 92.85)
N111 E101 92.80-92.70 (upper at about 92.79, lower at about 92.75)
N112 E97 93.14-92.75 (about 92.80)
In all but one case, samples were not collected from the initial level in a unit,
since only a centimeter of fill would insulate these from the eroded surface. In addition to
these standard samples, a few special samples were collected in the field and lab,
including two from a probable root mold in N110 E102, one from the fill of Feature 6,
another from sediment under the associated core, and several samples collected in the lab
from artifacts or other objects. There is also a column of 11 small sediment samples that
Joan DeCosta and I collected from the exposed wall of the main blufftop excavation
block (at N97 E96) in April, 1981; some of these have been subsampled for diatom
analysis. These, plus similar samples collected by David Brown during his excavations,
furnish samples of the upper sediments for comparison with their counterparts from the
bench.

Bulk sediment sampling from N109 E96
In the unit closest to the bluff (N109 E96), the matrix and "phytopol" samples
were collected as described, then all of the remaining fill passing through the 1/4" screen
was collected on a tarp underneath, saved by level in large plastic bags (Fig. 3.9), and
hauled to the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory in Austin, where it was washed through
fine mesh window screen to recover small vertebrate and invertebrate remains.
Approximately a cubic meter of fill was treated this way. Although little bone was
recovered from this particular unit, the sample of snails from the site was greatly
expanded, and a reliable estimate of the amount of "ambient" or "background" subfossil
bone in the sediments was obtained.

Unit 2 fill
As explained by David Brown (1983:17), part of the fill removed from Unit 2
(from the eroded bench surface down to the level of the Feature 5 fired surface) was wet
screened through nested 1/4" and 1/8" mesh hardware cloth. The unscreened part of the
fill was replaced in the unit as backfill at the end of the June, 1979 project. No lithic
cultural debris was found anywhere in the unit. The screened residue was bagged, and in
September, 1982, about three-fourths of this residue was again wet-screened, this time
through nested #12 and #35 geologic sieves. Examination of this residue suggested that
some contamination by snail and mussel shell fragments from the upper deposits had
occurred during the original wet-screening process. Very little bone was seen (laboratory
notes, September 10, 1982). Residue was rebagged in 1993 and remains in curation, but
has played no part in the analysis of the site.

385

It is very critical to note that none of the charcoal submitted for radiocarbon
assay, and none of the microfauna in lot B-149 (44 fragments representing at least two
dozen elements; Appendix 6) came from wet-screening. Instead, all charcoal and all bone
were collected by hand-picking.

The reason this distinction is crucial is that contamination can occur during wetscreening, either when foreign material is introduced through the pump intake, or when
screens are not thoroughly cleaned between lots of material. None of the material
analyzed for the present project was recovered by wet-screening.
Block removal of Feature 5
On April 18, 1980, I cut a four-sided trench around Feature 5, leaving an isolated
block of matrix about 21 cm on a side in the center for removal to the archeology
laboratory (Fig. 3.10). This block contains the core of the fired area, although some of the
periphery has evidently been lost. A small sample of the fired surface was removed in the
UTSA-CAR lab for lipid analysis. The surface and all sides of the block have also been
inspected closely in hopes of finding additional charcoal that could be used for AMS
dating; none has been found. The block remains available for further studies, although the
surface has been considerably altered by repeated troweling and by sampling for various
studies.

Field observations and their recording
The primary record of the bench excavations was the daily journal, which has
detailed information on particular units and levels when something noteworthy was
found. A log of levels excavated was maintained, but no level forms were filled out.
386

E98 in foreground. Beyond is Feature 5 completely isolated for removal as a
matrix block. Unit 2 lies to the left. Photo taken April 18, 1980; rapidly
rising waters of Coleto Creek Reservoir can be seen in upper right corner.
Instead, I recorded information on the sediments by photographing and drawing
profiles of all four walls of every excavation unit (except N113 E98, where only the west
and north walls were profiled), by drawing floor plans when horizontal variability was
apparent, and by later analyzing sediment samples for grain size and carbonate content.
387

Inclusions and features, whether cultural or noncultural, were drawn on level floor plans
by crew members, and elevations were recorded with transit shots. Special features (root
mold, ravine outwash, pits) were described in the daily journal; no feature forms were
used. The feature numbers assigned (5 through 7) are a continuation of numbers assigned
in the main block excavations by David Brown. A radiocarbon sample log and color and
black-and-white photo logs were maintained. Film roll numbers (B/W rolls 5-12, color
transparency rolls 5-9) assigned are a continuation of numbers assigned in the main block
excavations by David Brown. Large format cameras were not available, so photography
was exclusively 35 mm. Kodak Plus-X film was mostly used for black-and-white,
Kodachrome transparency film (plus one roll of Kodacolor color negative film) for color
photography. One roll of black-and-white infrared film was taken of the unit N109 E96
profiles, but since I did not have an infrared filter, the results were the same as
conventional black-and-white film.
Associated geologic samples
A few geologic samples from the site environs were collected. Two samples of
bedload material collected underwater from the creek bed have already been described in
Chapter 1. Some samples of Goliad sandstone from a knickpoint in the ravine southwest
of the bench area (Figs. 1.30, 1.32) were collected. Two narrow profiles on the Lissie
terrace cutbank were cleaned (locations 1 and 2 in Fig. 1.30), and some small sediment
samples were collected. Two samples from Lissie section 1 were analyzed for diatoms, to
check for possible reworking of Lissie-age diatoms into the bench sediments (discounted
by the analysis). There are also samples of pedogenic (?) carbonate obtained from
backhoe trenches 2 and 3 in Area B during the Flume #3 project.

388

Lighting conditions and their effect
Nearly all the fieldwork was done under wintertime lighting conditions. Winter
skylight is weak, diffuse (multidirectional), and deficient in the red or warm end of the
visible spectrum. This not only made photography difficult (an electronic flash was
unavailable), it also made viewing the profiles more difficult in some respects. In
wintertime the bench was never in direct sunlight except just after sunrise, when the edge
along the cutbank was lit for a brief time. Even at noon the excavations lay in complete
shadow. Lighting was always best for the south or west wall, depending on time of day,
and stratum descriptions for excavation profiles are based mainly on those two walls.
Minor stratigraphic units defined from the south or west wall were frequently difficult
and sometimes impossible to trace around all four walls, which accounts for some of the
minor discontinuities in the profiles.

Diffuse winter skylight, despite lack of color saturation, tends to accentuate color
differences at the expense of textural differences. Nevertheless, sediment analysis shows
that the strata defined in the field have textural validity, and it is quite possible that in
strong, direct summer light the subtle bench strata would have been nearly invisible. The
severest lighting problems occurred in N109 E96, set well back in a notch cut into the toe
slope. Here the stratigraphy was nearly impossible to define with confidence, but this
may also have been partly due to addition of colluvial sediments from the valley wall in
this area.
OVERVIEW: KINDS OF DATA RECOVERED
In addition to the small number of cultural features and stone artifacts that were
discovered in the bench deposits, an interesting array of data on past habitats and
389

environments was found in the bench deposits. The different kinds of proxy
paleoenvironmental data are reviewed in their respective chapters and appendices, but a
brief overview of the classes of data and their provenience units is given here.
Grain-size and carbonate content samples
A composite column consisting of three samples from N109 E103 plus 25 from
N110 E102, as well as one sample from the cutbank (stratum 2E), two from N109 E96,
and three from Lissie terrace sections 1 and 2. These have pipette analysis of fines, and
estimation of carbonate content (by weight loss after acid digestion). An unsuccessful
attempt was also made to measure organic content by the loss-on-ignition method.
Samples from the excavation units were extracted from general-purpose matrix sample
bags. There are also some sieved samples from the upper deposits, for which fines were
not analyzed.
Clasts
1/4" screen sample: chert pebbles, Goliad sandstone nodules, and carbonate nodules
(either pedogenic or clastic in origin) saved from all units.
Rhizoconcretions, ferromanganese concretions
1/4" screen sample: large samples from all units.
Micromorphology samples
Seven un-oriented aggregates from N111 E101, extracted from matrix samples.

390

Magnetic susceptibility samples
Five columns of samples (N109 E103, N110 E102, N111 E101, N112 E99, and N109
E96) extracted from "phytopol" samples, plus some samples from the cutbank, Feature 6,
for a total of 117 samples from the bench deposits; 10 more samples come from the upper
deposits at N97 E96. Altogether, 127 samples were analyzed.
Sediment lipid samples
Three small samples were analyzed, one from the hearth surface (Feature 5) and two
background samples from as nearly the same elevation as possible: N112 E99 (92.4092.35) and N113 E98 (92.40-92.30). Both plant and animal lipids were identified.
Sediment samples assayed for radiocarbon and carbon isotopes
Four sediment samples, all from N111 E101, were submitted for radiocarbon assay of the
humin fraction. These subsamples (ranging in dry weight from 1.02 to 2.0 kg) were
extracted from the general-purpose matrix samples, and Î´13C values were determined for
all of them. These, plus samples of wood charcoal submitted for assay are described in
the chapter on radiocarbon dating.

Animal bone
Almost all of the bone found in the bench deposits is from microvertebrates. Relatively
little came from screening; instead, most microfauna were found concentrated around
Feature 5, and were collected by hand-picking in the field or by scooping up small
quantities of loose dirt and bone during excavation. Some items were found and drawn in
place. Two of the largest, a raccoon humerus and a turtle plastron, both with cutmarks,

391

were found in the cutbank (provenience is shown in Fig. 3.1). Bone is very well
preserved, and the fauna is taxonomically diverse and informative.
1/4" screen sample: a small quantity of microvertebrate bones from various units.

bulk fill from N109 E96: a moderate number of microvertebrate bones.

hearth deposit from Unit 2 and N113 E98: a large quantity of microvertebrate bones
recovered by picking fragments from the excavation floor and by sieving small quantities
of loose sediment through a fine mesh sieve.
Snails
Snails are fairly well preserved. There is mechanical breakage of some taxa, but little
evidence of chemical dissolution. The snail fauna is abundant, diverse, and possibly the
most informative proxy environmental indicator.
1/4" screen sample: a moderately sample of large-bodied taxa, recovered from all units.

bulk fill from N109 E96: a very large sample of small (microsnail) to large-bodied taxa.

snail columns: two columns of sediment samples from N109 E103 (21 samples, total dry
sediment weight 69.42 kg) and N110 E102 (26 samples, total dry sediment weight 68.70
kg), processed through geologic sieves to extract microsnails.
Freshwater mussels or sphaeriid clams
About 31 mussels and 23 sphaeriid clams were recovered. The freshwater mussels are
powdery, poorly preserved, and for the most part were found in situ but were difficult to
392

recover intact. They are believed to have been brought to the site by human occupants,
but are quite informative about water depth and runoff conditions.
Pollen
Pollen column: analysis of a composite column consisting of one sample from N109
E103 and 24 samples from N110 E102, from the "phytopol" samples described earlier.
Pollen is badly degraded and so few grains remain that none of the samples are
statistically usable. The pollen tells little about environmental conditions.
Diatoms
Diatom column: similar to the grain-size samples, a composite column consisting of three
samples from N109 E103 and 27 from N110 E102, but extracted from the "phytopol"
samples; plus two samples from the upper deposits, two from Lissie terrace section 1, and
one sample from the cutbank (stratum 2E).
Plant macrofossils: charcoal, seeds, resin or amber
Except for rhizonconcretions (listed separately above), plant macrofossils are few in
number and are not very environmentally informative. About 28 charcoal samples were
logged, although microscopic examination of some of these showed some were actually
small, black, ferromanganese aggregates. Samples submitted for radiocarbon assay are
described in more detail in the chapter on radiocarbon dating. Nine samples of wood
charcoal were submitted for wood species identification, of which four were large enough
for identification to the generic level (all four were later submitted for radiocarbon assay).
A single small fragment of a possible charred but unidentified monocotyledon was
recovered from N113 E98. A small fragment of unidentified tree resin, sap, or amber was
recovered from screened bulk matrix in N109 E96. Several calcareous hackberry seed
393

tests were recovered, some of them having a charred appearance. Many of these were
discovered fortuitously in the laboratory, among samples of snail shell or other material
recovered from the 1/4" screen.
CULTURAL EVIDENCE FROM THE BENCH DEPOSITS
Analysis of the cultural evidence recovered from the bench deposits is beyond the
scope of the present work. However, a summary statement about the findings may be in
order here. By the late Holocene, Berger Bluff had clearly become a major base camp
with an extensive midden of shell, bone, and lithic debris capping the bluff (D. Brown
1983). The situation some 8,000-10,000 years earlier, however, was different. Human
occupation at that time appears to have been transitory, of very limited duration, and with
little impact on the site. The earliest use of the site is believed to have been as a foraging
station rather than as a residential site, so it is not surprising that the most important and
informative cultural evidence from the bench consists of animal bone and freshwater
mussels, rather than tools and manufacturing debris.

Lithic reduction (including biface thinning or resharpening) clearly was done at
the site at this early period, for there are cores (including a small single-facet polyhedral
core), a possible core-trimming flake, and at least one textbook example of a lipped softhammer biface thinning flake (Fig. 3.11, middle row). An in situ scatter of flakes from a
single chert cobble reduction episode was also excavated near the top of unit N109 E103,
and a small biface preform reject was discovered during trenching for removal of Feature
5 (Fig. 3.11, top row). There are no finished tools, however, except possibly for a
bifacially flaked chopper (Fig. 3.11, top row). Tool manufacture or refurbishing was
clearly a rather minor activity at the site, or at least the part that remained for us to
394

investigate, and although the bench deposits are clearly Paleoindian in age, none of the
lithic debris bears any hallmarks of other known Paleoindian lithic traditions. Instead, all
of the lithic debris is indistinguishable from generalized Archaic or Late Prehistoric
debris in south Texas.

Evidence of fire, in the form of small fired clay nodules, heat-altered chert
(potlids, heat-discolored or fire-crazed fragments), and calcined and heat-discolored snail
or mussel shell is fairly common, although not much charcoal remained in the sediments.

Three

cultural

features were formally investigated during the two 1979

excavation projects. Feature 5, located in Unit 2 (lower stratum 2B; stratigraphy will be
described in the chapter on sedimentology), is a small unprepared hearth (a well-baked
but otherwise unmodified sediment surface) with an associated deposit of microvertebrate
remains (extending into unit N113 E98) that is interpreted as a human latrine deposit (K.
Brown 1996). Feature 6 is a small pit that lay at the grid point between two units (N110
E102 and N111 E101, basal stratum 2A). The fill contained nothing except some baked
clay nodules and iron-stained snail shell, but a small chert core (Fig. 3.11, top row) lay
next to the pit. Feature 7 is another similar pit located in N109 E96 (stratum 2C?). The
fill contained snail shell, small sandstone and carbonate nodules, fossilized wood, small
bits of wood charcoal, and bone fragments of eastern mole, (probable) kangaroo rat,
unidentified mouse-sized mammal, and unidentified turtle and frog.

Feature 7, but below detection level (lot B-141-1, N109 E96, 92.25 m);

unmodified chert pebble (manuport, lot B-3, N109 E103, 92.90-92.85 m);
fired clay nodule (lot B-114, N112 E97, 92.70-92.65 m); chert thermal spall

core remnant (lot B-41-1, N110.62 E102.01, 92.51 m); chert primary flake
(lot B-15-2, N109.31 E103.94, 92.53 m).

396

Two other features are known but were not studied. One is a possible hearth (in
stratum 2D) encountered while clearing stratum 3 overburden (Figs. 3.1, 3.2, 3.7),
consisting of a cluster of sandstone nodules without any visible charcoal. The feature was
not documented nor was a feature number assigned. The other feature is a definite hearth
that was noted by Bill Birmingham during a visit to the site in the mid-1960s. It consisted
of a ring of sandstone nodules with an orange fired interior, probably located somewhere
in the vicinity of the three easternmost excavation units, or perhaps slightly to the south,
but at a slightly higher level that has since been removed by deflation of the bench
surface (Bill Birmingham, personal communication, 1983 and 1998). Since it appears that
the resistant bench surface has been lowered very little by erosion since its exposure, this
feature must have lain just above the level from which the 1979 excavations began, but
disappeared sometime during the preceding dozen or so years.
ANALYSIS METHODS: GENERAL PRINCIPLES
As the chapter on depositional history will show, a prominent feature of the bench
deposits is the cyclic banding visible in the cutbank. A key problem is to identify the
meaning of this cyclicity. Chapter 1 has already addressed the scale and significance of
cyclic climatic phenomena. Could these bands represent climatic cycles? One way to test
whether banding has a climatic origin is to inventory diatoms or snails and discover
whether assemblage composition changes at stratigraphic boundaries.

Some data are essentially qualitative in nature â that is, some things such as
mussel shells are informative, but occur in samples too small for quantitative treatment.
Other items, such as animal bones, are abundant enough for quantitative study, but are
too spatially clustered to illustrate long-term trends in abundance. Animal bones are
397

abundant in the microvertebrate bone bed next to Feature 5, but elsewhere in the site
occur only in moderate abundance. Other kinds of data, such as magnetic susceptibility,
carbonate content, or grain-size statistics, furnish single measures that can be plotted
vertically and compared among each other.

Two kinds of environmental proxies (snails and diatoms) are abundant, fairly
well distributed throughout the bench, and taxonomically diverse. These are best
examined by correspondence analysis, which allows case scores to be plotted vertically,
level by level, and compared both with other measures (such as grain-size statistics) and
with stratigraphic boundaries as defined in the field profiles.

Details of laboratory and analysis methods will be presented in the various
chapters and appendices to follow. Table 3.2 lists some of the analysis software
employed in various chapters.
