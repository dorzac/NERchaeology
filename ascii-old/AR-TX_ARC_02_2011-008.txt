ABSTRACT

On March 11 and 15, 2011, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
archaeological survey of the Hillsboro City Park and expansion area in
Hillsboro, Texas. The study was done for the City of Hillsboro at the
request of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The entirety of the
existing park and the proposed expansion area was walked, with special
attention given to the Pecan Creek channel, which runs north to south
through the expansion area. No cultural resources were found on the
ground surface, eroding from the creek banks, or in any of the 15 shovel
tests excavated in the study area. However, historic site 41HI313, which is
an earthen berm atop which the abandoned St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas
Railroad ran, was recorded during survey. Given the poor condition and
lack of integrity at the site, it is not considered eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological
Landmark. Based on the results of this survey, AR Consultants
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted.
However, if cultural materials are encountered during park expansion,
work should immediately stop in that area and the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Hillsboro has purchased twelve acres of undeveloped land situated adjacent
to the west end of the Hillsboro City Park, which is located in the northern part of the city
(Figure 1). Several improvements are to be made to the existing park property and a
walking trail is to be constructed in the newly acquired property using funds provided by
the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. In order to secure these funds, the city was
directed to have an archaeological survey of the park property conducted and then
approved by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
Pecan Creek forms the southern boundary of the existing park, while the northern
boundary is formed by the old St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas railroad berm that runs
northeast-southwest. Milford Road is the eastern boundary of the existing park and
Pleasant Road is the western boundary of the park. The expansion area is west of Pleasant
Road and extends south to Doyle Street and is bound by the northeastern corner of the
Old Hillsboro Cemetery. Pecan Creek extends west into the new property and then turns
north across the center of the tract and passes through the old railroad berm as it
continues west toward Little Hackberry Creek. The only modification planned within the
park expansion area is the construction of a native soil trail that will be situated on the
north and east sides of Pecan Creek. The property on the west side of the creek will not
be disturbed, and will leave an area that is more than three hundred feet wide between
Pecan Creek and the closest boundary of the Old Hill County Cemetery.
The survey was conducted for the city in order to determine if significant archaeological
sites are present and how they might be impacted by construction of the new walking trail
as well as improvements in the existing park. Because the city is a political subdivision of
the State of Texas, carrying out the survey required the issuance of a Texas Antiquities
Permit. Permit number 5912 was issued to AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) for the
archaeological survey. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974,
as amended (PL-93-291). The report has been formatted as per report guidelines
developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists and adopted by the Texas Historical
Commission.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF HILLSBORO CITY PARK

NATURAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
The proposed park site is located in the Blackland Prairie, which covers the eastern part
of Hill County (Sharpless and Yelderman 1993). The Blackland Prairie includes
grassland and savannahs and is reported to be the most extensive, the richest, the most
diverse, the most beautiful and the most sought after of the Texas interior prairie lands
(Hayward, Doliver, Amsbury and Yelderman. 1992:2). The study area also lies within the
Texan Biotic Province, which contains at least 49 mammal species, 39 snake species and
17 species of reptiles and amphibians. Common forms of fauna include deer, raccoon,
opossum, rabbit, lizards and turtles (Blair 1950:101-102).
The Eagle Ford Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972) which consists primarily
of shale, sandstone, and limestone underlies the proposed park site. The overlying soil
association is the Houston Black-Heiden-Altoga (Brooks 1978:General Soil Map) which
consists of deep, nearly level to gently sloping, moderately alkaline clayey upland soils.
Almost all of the park site is mapped as Heiden-Urban land complex (Brooks 1978:Sheet
Number 35) which has a shallow plow zone that is described as being up to six inches
thick and being dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) clay. Underlying this thin plow zone the
soil changes to dark grayish brown (2.5Y4/2) clay and remains in the 2.5Y color range to
below 58 inches where the clay is light olive brown (2.5Y5/4).
Pecan Creek is an intermittent tributary of Hackberry Creek, which joins with Aquilla
Creek upstream from the Aquilla Lake dam, which is just north of the boundary of Hill
County and McLennan County. Aquilla Creek empties into the Brazos River upstream
from Waco. Pecan Creek drains rainwater off the Blackland Prairie northeast of Hillsboro
but is not presently a spring-fed stream.
Prior to the survey, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2011) was consulted for sites
listed that were in the proposed park site but none was found. The only nearby recorded
site is 41HI255 which is a series of historic structures located on the edge of Katy Lake.
Archaeological studies in Hill County have been primarily associated with the
construction of Lake Whitney (Stephenson 1970) and more recently with the construction
of Aquilla Lake (Skinner 1972; Skinner and Henderson 1972; Lynott and Peter 1977;
Skinner, Shaw, Huckabay, and Bartsch 1978; Skinner, Turner, McGregor, and Richards
1979; Brown 1987). However, investigations in the Aquilla/Hackberry creek watersheds
began in the early 1930s when Frank Bryan (1937) published an article that described six
prehistoric sites within the Aquilla Creek Watershed, one of which was along lower
Hackberry Creek. Based on the artifacts described, most of the sites were Archaic in age
and probably dated between 6,000 BC and AD 750. Several Paleoindian sites in the
watershed have been described by the William Young of Corsicana (2011). Many of
these ancient sites date between 6,000 BC and 10,000 BC and were known to members of
the Dallas Archeological Society and the Central Texas Archeological Society. Limited
survey in the upper Hackberry Creek Watershed was done in 1975 for the Soil
Conservation Service (Skinner 1975a). Several prehistoric surface sites containing lithic

debris and occasional Archaic dart point fragments were found, as was the partial
skeleton of a bison that was considered a paleontological find and not an archaeological
one (Skinner 1975b). These surveys concluded that site density was lower than it is
downstream in the lake area, sites were small in area and had limited artifact assemblages
attributed to gravel knapping and hunting, and occupation was primarily in the Late
Archaic based on artifacts recovered and landowner reports. The only other survey
conducted in the area was by William A. Martin (1987) of the Archaeology Research
Program at Southern Methodist University who reported one archaeological site adjacent
to the Katy Lake (TASA 2011) that was recorded in conjunction with a park study done
for the City of Hillsboro.
History of Hillsboro
Formerly Hillsborough, the City was established in 1853 from a 220-acre plot donated by
Thomas M. Steiner (Maxwell 2011). Hillsborough was named for George W. Hill, a
surgeon from Tennessee. Hillsborough's first school opened in 1853; the post office in
1854. It is the county seat of Hill County. The post office shortened the name to
Hillsboro in 1888.
The first railroad to arrive in Hillsboro, Texas was the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MKT)
railroad, commonly called "the Katy," in 1881 (Hofsommer 2011). This rail connected
Dallas to other southern cities, via Hillsboro. The Katy Shops, constructed at the same
time, provided jobs for the citizens. In 1887, the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railroad,
also known as the St. Louis Southwestern Railway and the Texas and St. Louis Railway
Company (commonly called "the Cotton Belt"), was constructed, connecting Corsicana to
Hillsboro (Craver 2011). This rail line was not profitable, however, and it was
abandoned over the course of eight years, between 1932 and 1940.
To the west, near Highway 81, Old Hillsboro Cemetery (HI-C057) lies near the edge of
the proposed area of park expansion. According to records, the cemetery dates to the
mid-19th century and has 1,334 interments (TASA 2011). Hillsboro's second cemetery,
Ridge Park Cemetery (HI-C015), dates to around the same time, and is located to the
north and is much larger (TASA 2011). This cemetery is separated from the park by the
St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas railroad berm.
Growth in Hillsboro has been unsteady. It was incorporated in 1881 and received its first
charter in 1915. When the Katy Shops were withdrawn, some of the population was
forced to relocate along with them, to Bellmead. Historically, Hillsboro's main focus was
on agriculture, primarily cotton, but this expanded to the manufacture of clay and
building stone, as well as the cultivation of corn, oats, cattle and poultry.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF HILLSBORO CITY PARK

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

Based upon the site information described in the previous chapter, the potential for
encountering a prehistoric archaeological site would appear to be low. Sites would be
expected on low knolls or ridges near but not immediately adjacent to Pecan Creek. Very
few artifacts would be expected on the surface and any encountered by shovel testing can
be expected to be in the upper twenty centimeters of the dark grayish brown clay plow
zone. The only other place where prehistoric sites might be encountered would be in the
creek banks where past flooding covered an occupation surface and has continued to
cover it to such a depth that plowing has not reached it and thus destroyed or mixed the
topsoil and artifacts. The survey area is not likely to have been occupied historically, ie,
been the site of a residence, even that of a tenant house, due to seasonal flooding and the
farmability of the soil. There is a potential of finding historic trash that was discarded on
the side of the creek channel or adjacent, but no such sites were encountered upstream in
the Hackberry Creek Watershed. Additionally, there is the possibility that some artifacts
such as ties, spikes, rails, or other components that were associated with the St. Louis,
Arkansas & Texas Railroad will be encountered. However, this is unlikely given that the
railroad has been abandoned for over 70 years. In summary, it is unlikely that undisturbed
historic or prehistoric archaeological sites will be encountered by the survey of the Pecan
Creek Park.
The developed park area was walked over in such a way as to inspect those areas, which
are not covered with trails, parking areas, play areas, baseball diamonds, etc. and with
particular attention to the creek channel where historic artifacts may have been deposited
and where there was a chance that shallowly buried prehistoric site deposits might be
exposed. The new part of the park was systematically surveyed and shovel tested in order
to have a representative coverage of the undeveloped property. Shovel tests averaged 30
cm in diameter. The clay fill from the shovel tests was hand sorted to determine if
cultural materials were present. Shovel test matrices were also described on the basis of
texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil
colors in each test. Shovel test locations were recorded using a Garmin GPS Map 76
handheld GPS receiver. Furthermore, the creek channel was carefully inspected for
exposed areas where buried deposits might be present. Photographs were taken
throughout the survey area using a Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph 8.0 mega
pixel digital camera. Based on the depth of the soils present, no backhoe trenching was
conducted.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections; the first describes the terrain and natural
setting of the study area. The results of the survey and trenching follow, and conclusions
end the chapter. Although shovel tests are described generally within the text, a complete
description can be found in Table 1.
Study Area
The study area is located primarily within the extensively modified and manicured
grounds of Hillsboro City Park, but also extends into a wooded and undeveloped area
immediately to the west of Pleasant Street, which forms the current western boundary of
the park (Figure 2).

Figure 2.

The boundaries of the Hillsboro City Park shown on portions of the
Hillsboro East and West, TX 7.5’ USGS maps.

Several concrete walking trails, athletic fields, playgrounds, parking lots, pavilions and a
few small buildings such as restrooms are present within the park boundaries. Situated
primarily in the drainage valley of Pecan Creek, terrain throughout the park is fairly level,
with an average elevation of approximately 585’ asl. The exception to this is a distinct
rise in the northeastern portion of the park, which slopes up to over 600’ asl and offers a
commanding view of the park below (Figure 3). The topography of the park shows signs

of significant alteration by way of cut and fill activity, particularly in the northeastern
section, where a tract measuring approximately half of an acre has been leveled on the
rising slope to create a baseball field. The park and expansion area to the west area
bordered to the north by the old St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas railroad berm, while Pecan
Creek forms the southern boundary of the park. In this low-lying setting, the creek is
relatively narrow and shallow, measuring approximately 2.5 meters wide and less than a
meter in depth (Figure 4).
The proposed park expansion area is located immediately west of Pleasant Street, in a
thickly wooded area that is roughly bisected by the Pecan Creek channel. Vegetation here
consists of hackberry, oak and pecan, with an understory which includes greenbrier, ivy,
weeds and sparse prairie grasses (Figure 5). Terrain in this area is relatively level, though
elevations rise steeply to the south and west of Pecan Creek toward the level upland atop
which the City sits. The highest elevation encountered in this area is approximately 620’
asl. This abrupt increase in elevation results in portions of Pecan Creek featuring banks of
radically different height, such as can be seen west of Pleasant Street, where the gently
sloping banks on the north side of the channel, which are less than a meter high, are
dwarfed by four to five-meters high shale cliffs on the south (Figure 6). This is caused by
the Pecan Creek channel migrating south over time, and encountering the less easilyeroded shale of the Eagle Ford formation, which forms the underlying geology of the
region. However, the majority of the channel within the expansion area features relatively
even banks approximately two meters high. The channel itself is generally four meters
wide, with approximately 50cm of running water present at the time of survey.

The Survey
As stated in the Research Design, the primary purpose of this survey was to
systematically survey the proposed park expansion area west of Pleasant Street. As such,
the majority of shovel tests, 14 of the total 15, were placed in this area (Figure 7).

Shovel testing began in the wooded park expansion area on the approximate location of
the granite walking trail that will run atop the abandoned railroad berm on the northern
border of the park, before curving south to intersect with a circular native soil trail
bordered to the west and south by Pecan Creek and to the east by Pleasant Street
(Appendix A). Shovel test 01 encountered a soil profile consisting of 25cm of dark
grayish brown (10YR4/2) clay loam and loamy clay overlaying dark grayish brown
(2.5Y4/2) clay. The first 8cm of the shovel test contained traces of crushed rock, which
may result from the railroad berm to the north. Excluding the possible railroad berm fill,
this general soil profile was seen in almost all of the shovel tests excavated in the
relatively level Pecan Creek floodplain, which consisted of 22 and 36cm of dark grayish
brown (10YR4/2) clay or loamy clay overlying dark grayish brown (2.5Y4/2) clay or
loamy clay (Table 1).
The six subsequent shovel tests (02 though 07) were excavated on the roughly circular
proposed walking trail, two (08 and 09) were excavated on either side of the creek
channel, and five (10 through 14) were scattered throughout the expansion area west of
the creek on both the floodplain and the rising upland. Many of the shovel tests west of
the creek encountered vastly different soil profiles. These include shovel test 11, which
was excavated on a level area on the upland rise to the south, and encountered light olive
brown (2.5Y5/3) clay underlying 8cm of dark grayish brown topsoil; shovel test 12,
which was excavated atop the upland rise, and encountered 30cm of dark brown
(10YR3/3) loamy clay over light olive brown (2.5Y5/4), both of which contained calcium
carbonate; and shovel test 14, which was excavated near a gully west of the channel, and
encountered 50cm of very dark grayish brown (2.5Y3/2) loamy clay.
A final shovel test (15) was excavated within the existing park boundaries east of
Pleasant Street. It was placed near the location of a proposed concrete walking trail that
will supplement the existing trails in the park. This shovel test encountered a disturbed
soil profile consisting of mottled sandy loams and sandy clays, with abundant crushed
rock and pea gravel. As this shovel test likely represents the amount of gravel disturbance
throughout the park, no further shovel testing was done within the existing park
boundaries. No cultural remains were located in any of the shovel tests excavated within
the study area.
In addition to shovel testing, the entire length of Pecan Creek was walked, and the banks
were visually inspected for eroding prehistoric artifacts or for dumped historic material.
No prehistoric artifacts were noted to be eroding from the banks, and though a great deal
of debris, mostly modern building material and garbage, has been dumped in the channel,
none of it was noted to be historic in age. Additionally, a pile of debris was noted in the
expansion area west of Pleasant Street (Figure 8). It consisted primarily of reinforced
concrete, but also contained metal pipes and chunks of asphalt (Figure 9). The mixed
nature of the debris, along with the absence of mapped structures in the study area,
suggests that the pile results from episodic dumping over a period of time, and is not the
remains of a demolished structure that stood in the area.

Site 41HI313
As stated in the Cultural History of Hill County included in this report, the railroad berm
that runs along Hillsboro City Park’s northern border is part of the abandoned St. Louis,
Arkansas & Texas Railroad, as can be seen mapped as the “Old RR Grade” on the
Hillsboro East, TX 7.5’ USGS map (Figure 2). This railroad, also known as the
“Cottonbelt Line” operated in Hill County from 1887 to 1940, when it was completely
abandoned for financial reasons. Nothing remains of the railroad itself, as its tracks and
ties were most likely removed and reused decades ago. Additionally, whatever pilings,
trestles or other implements which once formed the railroad’s crossing over Pecan Creek

also no longer exist. All that is left is an earthen berm, which runs between Milford Street
on the east and Waco Street (SH 80) on the west. At its northeastern terminus, where the
surrounding terrain is higher and more level, the berm is less pronounced, and can
scarcely be discerned on the landscape. However, in the lower-lying areas to the
southwest, the berm attains its largest dimensions (Figure 10). The top of the berm
measures approximately six to eight feet wide and as tall as ten feet at its highest point.
The base of the berm is roughly 25 to 30 feet wide in the areas where the berm is at its
tallest. At the creek crossing, an approximately 70-meter long gap in the berm is present,
which represents the area where a bridge was once located. Due to its well-documented
age and regional significance, the abandoned St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railroad berm
was recorded as archaeological site 41HI313. However, its poor condition and lack of
integrity almost certainly make it ineligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).

Conclusions
As stated in the Research Design, the study area was thought to have fairly low potential
for containing prehistoric archaeological sites, and this was confirmed by the survey. This
low potential is due to its location primarily within the floodplain of Pecan Creek. The
frequently flooded nature of this area means that the only prehistoric sites that may
possibly be present would be temporary and ephemeral occupation surfaces located near
the channel margin, which survey confirmed to be absent. Longer-occupied campsites
may be present in the upland edge overlooking the creek, where prehistoric people would
have been above the level of periodic flooding. However, the absence of cultural material
found in this setting during survey determined that this is not the case within the study
area.
Historic potential in the study area was likewise thought to be low, and this was
confirmed by the survey as well. The frequently inundated, very arable nature of the
study area made it an unlikely place for historic settlement and this is buttressed by the
lack of mapped structures present in the study area. The only type of historic resources
thought to be possible in this setting were ephemeral trash scatters along the creek and
artifacts associated with the railroad, and even these were found to be absent, with only
modern debris seen dumped in the channel and in piles west of the park.
However, the presence of the “Old RR Grade” on the USGS map indicated the possibility
of encountering a potentially historic railway within the study area. This was confirmed
both by archival research that identified the mapped feature as the St. Louis, Arkansas &
Texas Railroad, which dates to the 19th century, and by the results of the survey.
Although an earthen railroad berm is all that remains of the railroad, it was recorded as
site 41HI313. Despite the lack of integrity and overall poor condition of the railroad
berm, which almost certainly makes it ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP or as a SAL,
it is nevertheless a part of the local and regional history of Hill County. Efforts need to
be made to record such minutia of local history, and a step in this direction is the
designation of the railroad berm as a historic archaeological site on file at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the results of the survey, AR Consultants, Inc. concludes that the potential
for encountering significant cultural resources within the park area is low. Therefore, we
believe that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted and we recommend
that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this recommendation. However, if
cultural materials are encountered during construction of the trail or any of the park
improvements, work should stop in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be notified.
