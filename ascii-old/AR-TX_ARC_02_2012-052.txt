ABSTRACT
The purpose of the Trinity River Mainstem Pipeline project was to transfer
water from a pump station that was to have been constructed on the east
bank of the Trinity River to a water treatment facility located in the
floodplain of the East Fork of the Trinity River near Crandall, Texas. The
pipeline project was being planned by the North Texas Municipal Water
District but work on the project has been discontinued. The proposed
pipeline route was approximately fifteen miles long and was situated
almost exclusively in the East Fork floodplain. Fieldwork was begun in
December 2011 but was delayed by issues of land access. The entire route
was surveyed for archaeological sites and shovel testing was conducted
throughout the floodplain. Limited backhoe trenching was conducted in
several locations although no buried sites were encountered.
Three prehistoric sites (41KF151-153) and one historic archaeological site
(41KF150) were recorded. The prehistoric sites are primarily surface lithic
scatters where Late Archaic dart points were found. A Late Prehistoric
arrow point was found on the surface of site 41KF151 but no pottery or
other evidence of Late Prehistoric occupation was found. The three
prehistoric sites (41KF151, 41KF152, and 41KF153) have been
determined not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) or for nomination as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL). The historic site is the location of Lock and Dam #7 which was
part of the early 1900s Trinity River Navigation Project that was never put
into operation. Besides the lock and dam which span the river, the site
includes a ramped concrete platform on which a storage building had been
built, as well as two concentrations of four foot tall concrete piers that held
up wooden frame residences or offices. Other structures and the east half
of the lock may still be present under a meter of floodplain sediments. The
historic Lock and Dam #7 (41KF150) and associated structures are of
unknown eligibility for listing on the NRHP and for nomination as a SAL
and warrants further investigation.
AR Consultants recommends that if the pipeline is to be built in the future,
trenching the drainage crossing southeast of the lock and dam site should
be done to explore for evidence of buried historic or prehistoric
occupation. The pipeline route from the drainage north should be trenched
and shovel tested to demonstrate avoidance of lock and dam site. Because
of its historic significance, it is recommended that the Lock and Dam #7
site should be protected from further erosion but this is not part of the
pipeline project.

INTRODUCTION
North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) intended to construct the Trinity River
Mainstem Pipeline in southwest Kaufman County, Texas. The proposed fifteen mile long
pipeline was to have extended south from a splitter box within the East Fork Wetland
water polishing facility located west of Crandall on the west side of the East Fork of the
Trinity River [hereafter the East Fork] and north of US Highway 175. The route was to
have crossed the East Fork and proceeded in a generally southerly direction at the edge of
and in the floodplain until crossing the abandoned Texas & Pacific Railroad berm west of
the community of Rosser. The route then turned west and paralleled the berm for a short
distance before turning north and crossing to the north side of the berm again. At this
point it was to have turned west and then north before reaching a pump station site that
was located on the east of the Trinity River just upstream from the site of Lock and Dam
#7 that was built between 1914 and 1918 on the main stem of the river to allow boat
traffic to travel the river between Dallas and the Gulf Coast.
The proposed pipeline route was approximately 15 miles long and was to have been
constructed within a 100â wide easement/right of way and buried in an open cut trench.
The route is situated primarily in the East Fork floodplain and would have crossed several
intermittent drainage channels and sloughs that are associated with the meanderings of
the East Fork channel across the floodplain. Some of the channel changes are due to the
construction of man-made levees that provided for more efficient farming in the early
1900s. Archaeological sites could be present along any of the old East Fork channels that
are no longer active or the creeks and tributaries that fed into it.
During mid-December, 2011, AR Consultants, Inc. began the pedestrian archaeological
survey of the pipeline route. The survey began on the north and proceeded to the south.
Fieldwork was not continuous due to weather conditions that made access impossible and
also due to landowner access stipulations. The purpose of the survey was to determine if
archaeological sites are present on or buried in the native soils, make recommendations
about their significance and eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP), warrant designation as a State Archaeological Landmark (SAL), and
how they might be impacted by pipeline construction.
The survey was conducted for the engineering firm of Alan Plummer Associates, Inc.
which is serving as the environmental permitting agent for Freese and Nichols, Inc., the
prime consultant responsible for designing the project for NTMWD. The report is to be
reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE). Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190, and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974,
as amended (PL-93-291). In addition, since NTMWD is a political entity of the State of
Texas, an Antiquities Permit was required, and permit #6117 was assigned to the project.

The scope of the project included a records review, a field survey, the recording of sites if
present, and the preparation of a summary report. This report was written in accordance
with report guidelines adopted by the Archeology Division of the THC and developed by
the Council of Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief
description of the natural setting of the project area. This is followed by a short
discussion about North Central Texas archaeology and history. The research design and
methodology follow. The results of the field survey are presented as the major chapter of
the report. Recommendations conclude the text. A list of references cited is at the end of
the report and is followed by shovel test and trench descriptions in Appendices A and B.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The proposed pipeline route is confined primarily to the east side of the East Fork
floodplain outside the earthen levees that parallel the river channel. The floodplain
sediments consist entirely of Holocene-aged alluvium, which contain clay, sand, gravel,
and silt (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). Pleistocene-aged fluvial terrace deposits
overlie the floodplain alluvium to the east. Both are underlain by several Upper
Cretaceous-aged clays and marls. These include the adjacent Kemp Clay and Corsicana
Marl undivided and the Neylandville Formation and Marlbrook Marl undivided.
Knappable gravels known as Uvalde Gravels are noted to occur on the surface of the
uplands in Dallas and Kaufman counties (Byrd 1971:17). In terms of knappable stone, the
Uvalde Gravels were increasingly utilized as a source for lithic raw material during the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric in the Upper Trinity watershed (Prikryl 1990:47-65). These
gravels consist of about 90 percent quartzite and 10 percent chert (Menzer and Slaughter
1971:217-218).
The most common soils encountered along the proposed pipeline route are occasionally
and frequently flooded Trinity clay, which constitute the East Fork and Trinity
floodplains (Pringle 1977:Sheets 35, 41, 47, 53, and 59). The pipeline route runs through
the occasionally flooded soil, which is situated in the portion of the floodplain bounded
by levees, where flooding is less intense. The soil profile listed for the Trinity series by
the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) consists of banded A-horizons of dark gray to black
clay to a depth of at least 72 inches (180 cm). The C-horizon is listed as gray clay with
distinct brown mottles. A number of other soils would have been crossed for short
distances by the pipeline route, where it skirts the curve of an upland ridge in the north
and near where it terminates in an elevated complex of terraces and upland soils. The
soils encountered in the north include Houston Black clay, which is an upland soil
associated with broad watershed divides, and Ferris clay and the Ferris-Heiden complex
of clays, both of which are located on side slopes upslope from drainages. In the south,
the pipeline route encounters Wilson silty loam and Konawa loamy fine sand, which are
upland soils associated with upland plains and slopes, and the Styx-Aquic Haplustalfs
complex of deep sandy soils that constitute the terraces. Lewisville silty clay, which sits
on the foot slopes of terraces, is also encountered.
The southwest portion of Kaufman County is located in the Blackland Prairie
physiographic region of Texas (Diamond, Riskind and Orzell 1987: Figure 1). The
Blackland Prairie is in the northern part of the larger Texan biotic province, which
characterizes much of North Central Texas (Blair 1950). KÃ¼chler (1966) classified the
Blackland as grassland dominated by Andropogon-Sipa grasses, with stands of deciduous
timber generally present along the drainages. Prehistorically, the portion of the East Fork
in the study area would have been dominated by a bottomland forest consisting of various
oaks, elm, hackberry, pecan, and other trees. Understory vegetation would have included
hawthorn, greenbrier, honeysuckle, grapes, berry vines, and various sedges and grasses in
drier areas. Approximately 30 percent of the forested area would have been open.

However, today, most of the land inside the levees has been cleared for agricultural
purposes (Richner 1976:4-5).
The Trinity River, which forms part of the western border of Kaufman County, and the
East Fork, its largest immediate tributary, have been extensively channelized. Indeed, the
current channels at times diverge entirely from their mapped courses, and numerous old
channels and meanders crisscross the study area, with some still containing water.
However, many of the old river channels and meanders have been silted in, and have
essentially become marshes. In addition to river channelization, an extensive levee was
constructed to the east and north of the river in an effort to stem seasonal flooding.
Determining the paleo-environment for North Central Texas is complicated. Recent work
on the paleo-environment of North Central Texas by Reid Ferring (1994) examined the
Upper Trinity terraces. Ferring believes the Early Holocene (11,000 to 7,500 years ago)
was moister than today and during the Middle Holocene (7,500 to 4,500 years ago), there
was a period of decreased rain, but moist conditions returned to North Central Texas
during the Late Holocene. Further refinement of the past environment is described from a
buried archaeological site located in the Clear Fork of the Trinity River in Tarrant County
where soils, fauna, and vegetation indicate that the West Fork Paleosol dates between
2300-1000 years ago. At that time the environment was cooler and wetter than at present
(Hall, Boutton, Lintz, and Baugh 2011). As discussed in other recent publications (Foster
2012; Benson, Berry, Jolie, Spangler, Stahle, and Hattori 2006) the period of the past four
thousand years has been one of oscillating climate swings every 500 to 800 years. The
Medieval Warm Period correlates with population growth in both Europe and North
America between AD 900-1300. For the next three hundred years, a colder and wetter
climate that at the present prevailed and is termed the Little Ice Age. In the Southern
Plains of Texas this was a time when buffalo remains are commonly found in prehistoric
sites (Dillehay 1974). The current warm period began in the mid-1800s.

CULTURAL HISTORY
A definitive chronological framework for the Upper Trinity River Basin and North
Central Texas has been difficult to establish for several reasons. Deep Holocene
alluviation has preserved buried occupation surfaces, both in the Holocene, as at the
Dalby site on the main stem of the Trinity River in Dallas County, and in the Pleistocene,
such as at the Aubrey site on the Elm Fork below the Lake Ray Roberts dam. Without
alluviation, these sites would have remained surface deposits, likely with no contextual
integrity. However, a prehistoric chronology based on Prikryl (1990), with a divided Late
Prehistoric and an added Historic period is presented to provide a temporal framework
for the culture history of the region.

6,000 B.C. to 4,000 B.C.
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

Prehistoric Native American settlement in North Central Texas began at least 11,000
years ago as attested to by the presence of Clovis dart points at the Lewisville site (Crook
and Harris 1957) and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001) in Denton County. Moreover,
artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff, and other PaleoIndian points from surface sites in the region (Bever and Meltzer 2007). The presence of
exotic, non-local lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled a territory
where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw material
trading. These early people hunted now-extinct large game, but probably also foraged off
the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from as early as 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late
as A.D. 700. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the area but particularly along the
major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods.
Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts found
on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making and using exotic cherts
for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics for
chipped stone tools. Smaller lithic scatters have been recorded in upland areas throughout
Kaufman County. These sites appear to be Archaic in age, but none have been thoroughly
studied (Prikryl 1990).
The definition of the Late Prehistoric, which ranges from approximately A.D. 700 to
1750 has been problematical. Krieger (1946:137-141) attempted a chronological
framework for North Central Texas when he defined the Henrietta Focus. Prikryl
(1990:12) states that the artifacts and features from the Henrietta Focus bear strong

similarities to those at Plains Village sites in the Southern Plains area. However, Peter
and McGregor (1988:367) believe that further research should be done on defining the
Henrietta Focus.
Stephenson (1952:305-312) tried to create a chronological sequence for the Upper Trinity
River Basin when he defined the Wylie Focus, which was dated to A.D. 1300 to 1600,
based on shell and clay-grit tempered pottery which, he believed, was Caddo in origin.
The Wylie Focus was characterized by large circular pits, no indigenous pottery, flexed
burials (both single and multiple and in poorly defined burial pits), maize agriculture, and
villages. The concept of the Wylie Focus was questioned when Bruseth and Martin
(1987:280) dated pits at the Bird Point Island and the Adams Ranch sites to the Late
Archaic period.
Influenced by Lynott's (1977) earlier work, Prikryl (1990:62) divided the Late Prehistoric
into two phases, the Late Prehistoric I, dating from A.D. 700 to 1200 and Late Prehistoric
II, dating from A.D. 1200 to 1600. Late Prehistoric I diagnostic traits included maize
horticulture, house remains, grog-tempered and sand-tempered pottery, and Scallorn,
Alba, Steiner and Catahoula arrow points. Late Prehistoric II seems to occur about the
time that the climate of northern Texas became drier. Diagnostic traits included an
emphasis on bison hunting, Washita, Fresno and Harrell arrow points, bison scapula hoes,
"Plains-like" lithic artifacts, and settlements on sandy terraces above the floodplains (Late
Prehistoric I people had lived on floodplains). It is important to note that Prikryl
suggested that site placement is suitable for agriculture, even though there appears to be
no evidence of agriculture except for the bison scapula hoes.
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the North Central Texas area based on an absence of sites with trade
goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish, or English traders (Skinner
1988). This interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and attempts to factor in
negative information generated by professional and avocational archaeologists who have
conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region. There is very little evidence of
historic era Native American occupation anywhere in the North Central Texas although
historic accounts indicate that groups were present as late as the early 1800s.
Current research seems to indicate that Anglo settlers were the first non-Indians to settle
in North Central Texas. Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, the
aboriginal inhabitants continued to play a role in the history of the region. Garrett
(1972:24) states âIndian hostilities almost depopulated North Texas (of Anglo dwellers)
after 1839. It dwindled to less than half.â Hostilities continued until the Treaty of 1843
was signed by the State of Texas and ten Native American tribes. This treaty provided the
impetus for settlement of several North Central Texas counties.
The first Euro American settlement in Kaufman County occurred in 1840, when William
King and forty other pioneers from Mississippi emigrated to a headright secured from the
Republic of Texas (Hart 2011). The town that grew up around this initial settlement
became known as Kingâs Fort, or Kingsboro, in honor of its founder. After annexation of
Texas, Kaufman County was drawn out of what was then Henderson County, and Kingâs

Fort was chosen as the county seat, and subsequently named after the county. Agriculture
was the countyâs primary land use, and cotton production came to dominate the countyâs
agricultural output in the years between 1880 and 1930. With the advent of the Great
Depression, farm values fell, and emigration from the county increased for the next three
decades to a low in 1960. Since that time, populations have risen steadily, fueled by
growth in the countyâs agribusiness, manufacturing and retail sales industries, and the
eastward expansion of the City of Dallas.
Previous Investigations
The most notable archaeological surveys and excavations in the East Fork area were
conducted at Lake Lavon and Lake Ray Hubbard (formerly Forney Reservoir). The
surveys were not systematic or comprehensive, as would be required by the USACE and
the THC today, but were essentially reconnaissance surveys focused on prehistoric sites
and on areas that had high probability for containing preserved site deposits.
Nevertheless, 25 sites were recorded at Lake Lavon (Stephenson 1949b; 1949c) and
subsequent excavation defined the Wylie Focus (Stephenson 1949a; 1952). This work
built on earlier investigations by members of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS)
(Harris 1948 and 1960; Wilson 1946). In the 1960s and 1970s, further survey and
excavation was done which added to our understanding of the local archaeology (Lorrain
1965; Lynott 1975, 1977). In 1963, the DAS surveyed the area of Lake Ray Hubbard and
recorded 33 archaeological sites (Harris and Suhm 1963), primarily on terraces,
floodplain knolls, and ridges. This survey described 20 sites already known to the DAS
membership (Hannah 1941; Hannah and Harris 1948), and located 13 previously
unrecorded sites. Only limited excavations were subsequently conducted (Ross 1966), but
along with the previous DAS excavations, they did provide evidence of the way of life
practiced by the prehistoric peoples who occupied the East Fork valley.
In addition to the large area studies conducted for lake projects, a number of surveys were
been conducted along the East Fork. R.K. Harris (1936) and several members of the
Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) surveyed the East Fork downstream from the Lake
Ray Hubbard dam and recorded sites there. These sites were generally located in farmed
fields situated on the leading edge of terraces or other natural projections into the
floodplain. Another survey of the river channel was done as part of planning for
channelization (Richner 1976). This survey was limited in scope due to reliance on
surface exposure of sites in areas where flooding, plowing, and erosion had removed
vegetation or sediment. However, the survey did identify 12 new sites exposed in the
channel cut bank. One site adjacent to the study area, 41KF8, was located during the
survey, and contained fire-cracked rock, mussel shells, and lithic debris. No shovel tests
were excavated during this survey, however, and it is possible that other sites along the
banks of the East Fork and within its floodplain were overlooked.
Since the 1970s, numerous small-scale cultural resources surveys were conducted of
transmission corridors, pipelines, and SCS floodwater retarding structures throughout
Kaufman County (Ferring 1975; Lynott and Banks 1975). The overall impression from
these studies is that historic and prehistoric cultural resources are present, but are widely

scattered and sites are small and frequently consist of upland surface deposits. Of note is
the fact that lithic procurement sites are found in upland areas where metaquartzite
gravels occur. Habitation sites are reported to be near available water sources.
Several surveys have been conducted near the study area. One of these surveys recorded
a shell lens site (41KF122) in the channel of the East Fork, and a historic house site
(41KF121) on a low ridge at the eastern edge of the valley (Skinner 1992). The recent
survey of the Cobisa-Forney Electric Power Plant Site recorded no historic or prehistoric
sites in the Buffalo Creek floodplain (Price 2001). An approximately 9,700â long pipeline
route, with associated bore holes in the East Fork, was monitored by ARC that would
provide natural gas to the Forney Electric Power Plant (Skinner, Kent, Wheeler, Trask,
and Todd 2002). The pipeline route is located approximately 1.3 miles south of SH 80
and crosses the East Fork floodplain. An interesting result of this monitoring was that a
bois dâarc tree trunk located approximately a meter below the floodplain surface was
radiocarbon dated to 120+50 B.P. (Beta-170374). This indicates that a meter of alluvium
has been laid down since the late 1800s.
In preparation for construction of the East Fork Raw Water Supply Project pipeline, ARC
conducted an archaeological survey and evaluation of 43.5 miles of pipeline route that
primarily runs north from the study area and extends to the shore of Lake Lavon in Collin
County (Todd and Skinner 2005). Four historic sites were recorded in the Blackland
uplands and one prehistoric shell lens site (41KF134) was recorded in the East Fork
floodplain. A total of 32 shovel tests and 13 backhoe trenches were excavated during the
survey. Three of the backhoe trenches were used to determine the boundaries of site
41KF134, a shell lens site. In 2006, ARC conducted an archaeological survey of a
wetland tract within the levees of the East Fork to determine if sites were present in
elevations along the levee southeast of Seagoville (Todd and Skinner 2006). This tract is
located immediately west of the northern end of the study area. No cultural materials
were found in 41 shovel tests and 4 backhoe trenches.
Several investigations have been conducted at the Gilkey Hill site (41DL406), which is
situated on a knoll in the East Fork floodplain north of the study area. The site was
originally recorded by Harris (1942) during a DAS survey of the East Fork floodplain,
and was later revisited by ARC during a pipeline survey (Skinner 2001). Shovel testing at
the site located a total of 273 artifacts. These included FCR, bone, mussel shell, and
abundant lithic material consisting primarily of flakes, cores, and bifaces, but with two
partial dart points located as well. These points were identified as Wells and Yarborough
points, which suggest a tentative date range for this site between the Early (Wells) and
Late (Yarbrough) Archaic period.
ARC conducted additional work at the Gilkey Hill site in 2005/2006, when the site was
tested in preparation for the installation of the Buffalo Creek Interceptor sewer line
through the site boundary (Todd, Skinner, and Trask 2006). However, despite the
excavation of eight backhoe trenches and 16 test units, no burials or human remains, no
distinguishable midden deposits, and no cultural features were located. One decorated
rim sherd, an arrow point base, and four dart points were recovered, in addition to
________________________________________________________________________

artifacts similar to those seen during the 2001 survey. The diagnostic artifacts suggest
episodic or periodic occupation of the site in the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods. A 2 Sigma-calibrated radiocarbon date of 460 to 290+40 BP (Beta-216538) was
obtained from a sample collected 40cm below the surface. This date range indicates that
at least the Archaic artifacts were in a derived context, with very few in situ site deposits
present.
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) shows that, while relatively few
archaeological surveys have been conducted near the study area, a number of sites have
been recorded in the East Fork floodplain (2011). Near the northern end of the pipeline,
Forest Kirkland recorded site 41KF43 in 1941. Situated on a mapped knoll southwest of
the East Fork, Kirkland describes the site as a surface camp featuring a scatter of lithics,
potsherds, mussel shell, and broken bones. He notes that locals had reported finding
projectile points, but that much of this material had been looted by the time the site was
recorded. 41KF5 was recorded in a similar setting atop an elevated knoll east of the river
by C.K. Chandler in 1968. Located in a cultivated field north of Buffalo Creek, Chandler
classified the site as an open camp, and noted a diversity of artifacts on the surface,
including a grooved sinker stone, one possible Clear Fork gouge, one Well point, one
possible Frio dart point, one large stem fragment and a small biface.
South of Buffalo Creek, PBS&J conducted a survey of a transmission line for the Trinity
Valley Electric Cooperative in 2009. The transmission corridor roughly parallels that of
the East Fork Raw Water Supply Project pipeline surveyed by ARC in 2005. During the
2009 survey, PBS&J field personnel recorded two prehistoric sites: 41KF139 and
41KF140 (Cliff, Perry, and Pemberton 2011). 41KF139 consisted of mussel shell and
FCR found in the back dirt of an auger hole dug in preparation for construction of a tower
foundation. Judging by the color of the soil, the depth of the site was determined to be
approximately 2.5 meters. 41KF140 consists of a single quartzite flake located in an
auger hole at between one and two meters in depth. Both sites were found in the
floodplain, but not directly adjacent to the river channel. 41KF139 was located on an old
East Fork channel, while 41KF140 was recorded west of Buffalo Creek. Given the
paucity of artifacts, no further work was recommended for either site.
Four sites (41KF76-78 and 41KF85) were located to the south atop a series of hills
located on the terrace edge east of the floodplain, generally parallel to Ezell Slough. The
sites were recorded by William Young and family, and consisted of surface scatters of
lithics and bone. 41EL1 was recorded west of the study area in Ellis County, where Red
Oak Creek converges with the Trinity River. The site was recorded by members of the
DAS, principally Harper and Long, and consists of a series of midden deposits containing
abundant cultural material ranging in age from a Late Archaic-age Gary point to Late
Prehistoric pottery sherds. Long notes that burials have been reported at the site, though
this was not confirmed when the site was recorded. The final site located near the study
area is 41KF57, which sits atop the upland edge south of the pipeline route, and is similar
to the other elevated open camps discussed earlier. The site is located in an area that has
been quarried, and little may remain.

A review of historic maps, including the 1936 and 1961 General Highway Maps of
Kaufman County (Texas State Highway Department), was conducted prior to fieldwork
in order to search for potential historic resources. Both the 1936 and 1961 maps show
structures plotted near the study area along the south side of CR 3039. Review of the
Scurry, TX 7.5â USGS map, which was based on 1961 aerial photography and
photorevised in 1973, shows that, by the second half of the 20th century, no structures
remained. No structures were located along the remainder of the proposed pipeline route,
which is predictable, given that the route runs primarily through a floodplain setting.
Review of recent aerial photography confirms these findings.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
A comprehensive records check and map review was conducted to produce specific
research problems regarding prehistoric and historic resources prior to the
commencement of fieldwork. Numerous prehistoric sites have been recorded in the
immediate area (Richner 1976; Texas Archeological Sites Atlas 2011). Early maps of
Kaufman County (Texas Agricultural Experiment Station 1936; Texas State Highway
Department 1936, 1961) were reviewed to determine if historic structures were mapped
within the survey area and local history was reviewed to determine the possibility of
other cultural remains, several potential locations were identified. Information gathered
by those surveys guided this research design.
Research Design
Within the Trinity River Mainstem Pipeline route there are several settings that provide
moderate to high potential for the discovery of prehistoric sites. About 95 percent of the
survey area lies within the quaternary alluvial deposits of the Trinity River and the East
Fork Trinity River floodplains. Within the Trinity River floodplains deeply buried
prehistoric sites have previously been recorded indicating the possibility of prehistoric
cultural remains being buried greater than one meter deep under quaternary alluvial
deposits (Cliff, Perry and Pemberton 2011, Skinner, Kent, Wheeler, Trask, and Todd
2002). Although these sites are deeply buried, they are most likely to occur adjacent to
the old river channels and drainages where the habitants had ready access to food and
fresh water. Shovel testing in the floodplains is determined to be unwarranted due to the
nature of deeply buried deposits, and trenches will be excavated near river and slough
crossings to test for the deeply buried prehistoric sites. The Texas Historical Commission
has agreed with these recommendations.
The second possible setting is upland edge soils, which are described by the SCS as
âancient terracesâ (Pringle 1977:6, 18), or upland soils at the margin of the East Fork of
the Trinity Riverâs floodplain were occupied prehistorically when the East Fork channel
was adjacent to or closer than it presently is. It is also possible that the occupation of the
frequently flooded or occasionally flooded Trinity soils along in the project area adjacent
to upland soils may contain shallowly buried archaeological site deposits that may be
contemporaneous with or more recent than occupation on the terrace soils. The shallowly
buried settings in the Trinity River soils may date after the terraces if river bank
occupation followed the lateral movements of the river toward the west. Shovel testing
will be focused on shallow Trinity and upland soils where encountered. The alternative to
the above is that sites are not present in either setting.
Based on the review of early historic maps and a history of floodplain development, the
best chance for finding historic artifacts are along old road routes prior to the building of
the levees that have pushed the East Fork west from its original location. Since levee
formation in the early 20th century, floodplain soils have been reclaimed for agricultural
purposes increasing the likelihood of historical cultural remains. Several locations were
identified based on road proximity and mapped structures to have a strong likelihood of

13

historic significance. Post levee formation also provides a strong possibility for
unmapped cultural remains to be discovered away from established roads. Map reviews
also indicate that the proposed pipeline corridor crosses two historic railroad berms that
were critical to the growth of both Crandall and Rosser, Texas. The railroad berms
provide a strong possibility of cultural remains to be located within the adjacent areas.
Methodology
In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, an intensive
pedestrian survey was conducted. A 100â wide corridor was surveyed along the pipeline
route, shovel tests and trenches did not exceed outside of the area of potential effect (APE).
The APE for the Trinity River Mainstem Pipeline is approximately 88,190 feet long x 100
foot wide (202.46 acres).

The full length of the proposed pipeline routes were walked by a two-person crew using
parallel transects spaced 20-30 meters apart. The minimal requirements for shovel testing
were met as defined by the Texas Historical Commission (ND) for slope and terrace
settings and excavated to the bottom of the A-horizon or to 100 centimeters below
surface (cmbs). Shovel tests supplemented by augering were excavated where ground
visibility was less than 30 percent and slope was less than 20 percent. Shovel tests
averaged 30 cm in diameter. Sediments were screened through a Â¼â mesh hardware
screen. Periodic shovel testing within the floodplain soils was conducted to test for a
depth greater than one meter verifying the need of backhoe trenching. Subsequent to
completing the pedestrian survey of the study area, backhoe trench locations were
selected. A profile of each trench was prepared and a soil sample from each stratum was
screened through 1/4" mesh screens.
If site deposits were discovered during survey and/or testing, it was considered important
to determine their lateral and horizontal extent within the study area. For sites that fall
completely within the survey corridor, a minimum of six shovel tests were excavated to
determine the site boundaries. If sites extended out of the project area shovel tests were
excavated within the survey corridor but the limits outside the APE were defined by
surface evaluation only, no subsurface testing was conducted outside the project area.
Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil
Color Chart was used to identify soil colors. Photographs were taken throughout the
survey area using a Fuji FinePix J38 12.2 mega pixel digital camera or a Canon
PowerShot A800 10 mega pixel digital camera. Shovel test locations were recorded with
a handheld Garmin GPSmap 78 GPS unit. Notes were taken about the surface visibility,
land disturbances, drainage channels, and vegetation. Furthermore, we needed to
determine through shovel testing if site deposits showed vertical separation of light
versus heavy artifacts or if bioturbation occurred in the vertisols. In addition, it was
important to identify datable materials and ecofacts, if present, because these are
necessary for determining site significance for listing on the NRHP.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into three parts: the first describes the pedestrian survey and
mechanical testing. The second presents site descriptions and is followed by conclusions.
The survey was conducted from north to south and is presented in that order. A total of
45 shovel tests and five backhoe trenches (Figure 3) were excavated and are described in
the text, specific information is listed in Appendices A and B, respectively.

Survey
Splitter Box to Highway 175
The pipeline route begins at a splitter box that is located on the west side of the East Fork
within a NTMWD water polishing facility. The pipeline route proceeds to the east on the
north side of an intake structure and a diversion pump station, adjacent to a wooded area,
prior to crossing the East Fork. Figure 2 is taken from the waterâs edge facing west along
the pipeline corridor; the intake structure is on the left, the pump station is in the
background.

Shovel test 1 (ST1) was excavated in this area for the purpose of determining if cultural
remains were present on the river bank. Three sediment zones were uncovered. The first
consisted of very dark grayish silty clay for the first 15 cmbs. The second consisted of
black silty clay to a depth of 100 cmbs and the third zone of very dark gray silty clay
continued below 125 cmbs. The shovel test met the expectations of a stratified A-horizon
as described by the SCS for frequently flooded Trinity floodplain deposits but no cultural
materials were found.
East of the river (Figure 4) the corridor passes through a forested environment and turns
south for approximately 100 m before it turns east and parallels Hwy 175. The forested
environment consists mostly of post oak and hackberry trees with some green briars.
After turning east, the north half of the pipeline corridor is forest covered and the
southern half is open grasslands. Ground visibility in this portion of the corridor was
between 0 and 10%. A shovel test (ST2) was dug within the forested strip to avoid
previous ground disturbance caused by highway construction. The shovel test exposed
very dark gray silty clay similar to that encountered in the lowest level of ST1 and was
terminated at a depth of 110 cm without encountering a second level.

An earthen levee and associated ditch are approximately 200 m from the river edge and

meters before the pipeline turns south to cross under Hwy 175. The isolated find is
located within floodplain deposits and has a hinged lid to allow access into the pipe, no
identifiable markings were observed. No artifacts were noted on the surrounding ground
surface.

Highway 175 to Lewis Road/FM 3039
The pipeline corridor is routed under Hwy 175 and will continue south southwest across
the grassy floodplain. The pipeline corridor parallels an existing pipeline for 1.1 km
before turning easterly to generally follow the contours of the hill slopes east of the
corridor. Visibility through this portion of the survey was poor (0-20 percent). The
exceptions were in those numerous areas where dirt mounds created by crayfish, fire ants,

and rodents provided repeated glimpses of subsurface sediments. Shovel test three (ST3)
was placed at the closest location to upland soils available within this segment of the
survey corridor. This shovel test exposed three sediment zones. The first was very dark
gray silty clay to a depth of 40 cmbs, followed by heavily mottled yellowish brown silty
clay and light yellowish brown sandy clay. At 58 cmbs the sediment changed to the
black silty clay observed elsewhere in the East Fork floodplain. The mottled deposit may
have been a product of previous pipeline installation due to the proximity of the existing
pipeline. Another shovel test (ST4) was placed immediately after the pipeline corridors
diverged before reaching the remains of County Road 4124. This shovel test was
excavated to a depth of 115 cmbs and exposed very dark gray silty clay that had calcium
carbonate deposits between 90 and 115 cmbs.
The first location where historic sites might have been present based on historic maps
was on the north side of County Road 4124. The county road is located on top of a levee
and previously was the route of Hwy 175 prior to its present location. The pipeline
corridor turns east approximately 50 meters north of the road and parallels it within a
ditch for 250 m before turning south. No historic artifacts or house/outbuilding
foundations were identified within the pipeline corridor where it parallels the road or
where the corridor turns south and crosses it.
Within 200 meters after the pipeline crosses County Road 4124, it also crosses the
Southern Pacific Railroad Berm as mapped on current USGS topographic maps, two deep
ditches and a second water control levee. The only evidence of a railroad line at this
location is the berm. The two ditches are located between the two levees and the railroad
berm, and are typically full of water based on a lack of ground cover and aerial
photographs. These depressions are most likely a product of the berm and levee
construction. The ponds located both north and south of the railroad berm were nearly
void of water during the time of the survey. The southern pond has large quantities of
tires located within the survey corridor (Figure 6). An estimated 2000 tires are visible
within the dry pond.
South of the second levee the ground cover is characterized by knee-high grasses with
poor (25%) ground visibility. Shovel test (ST5) was placed within the floodplain 360 m
southeast of the levee. The shovel test exposed two sediment zones, the first was dark
gray silty clay to a depth of 50 cmbs, and the second was very dark gray silty clay. The
shovel test was terminated within the second zone at 80 cmbs due to soil compaction.
Adjacent to the survey corridor and approximately 275 m south of ST5, a large pit had
been dug out and is currently open for trash disposal. The pit is partially filled with 55
gallon plastic drums and is deep enough to expose a clear B-horizon at approximately
two meters (Figure 7).

Immediately north of Lewis Road, the abandoned Thunderbird Racetrack which can be
seen on the current USGS topographic map has been demolished and rubble is scattered
throughout the area (Figure 8). Trash piles consisting of modern car parts, and plastic oils
jugs were observed immediately north of the racetrack within the survey corridor.
Ground visibility was poor (10-20%) with short grass cover and the occasional juniper or
oak tree. One shovel test (ST6) was excavated adjacent to the racetrack and three distinct
sediment zones were exposed. The first was very dark gray silty clay to 10 cmbs; the
second was very grayish brown silty clay that was heavily mottled with pale brown silty
clay. The third layer consisted of black silty clay that began at 38 cmbs and extended to
42 cmbs where the shovel test was terminated due to very compact sediment.

side of Lewis Road west of the pipeline corridor. View is to the northwest.

Lewis Road/FM-3039 to Little Buffalo Creek
Within the entire survey area, the portion between Lewis Road and Buffalo Creek was
determined to have the best potential for both prehistoric and historic archaeological
sites. The northern part of the survey route parallels Lewis Road before turning south to
round a bluff. Review of historic road maps indicated that historic sites might be within
the survey corridor, while the close proximity to the ridge and terrace sediments provided
an increased possibility that prehistoric sites might have also been present.

The survey corridor was covered with mixed vegetation between Lewis Road and Buffalo
Creek. It was predominantly ankle to knee high grass with woody patches that included
cedar, juniper, mesquite, and honey locust. The first seven hundred meters of the survey
corridor adjacent to Lewis Road parallels a fence line that sits a low berm (Figure 9). The
berm is approximately a meter high and three meters wide, the north side of it leads down
into floodplain prairie, the southeast side, after a ditch, leads uphill onto the ridge.
Fourteen shovel tests (ST7-ST20) were excavated within this short portion of the survey
corridor, nine of which (ST9-ST17) were associated with testing the boundaries of a
prehistoric site 41KF152. The site is located on the north side of the berm between the
floodplain and the fence line. The site and associated shovel tests are discussed in more
detail within the site section of this chapter.

Figure 9.

View northeast along the pipeline corridor adjacent to the berm and fence
line at shovel test eight.

Shovel tests seven and eight were excavated prior to finding the site. Shovel test seven
(ST7) was located immediately south of Lewis Road and exposed very dark gray silty
clays to a depth of 100 cmbs where very dark gray silty clay was mottled with a small
quantity of very dark grayish brown silty clay for an additional 15 cm. Shovel test eight
(ST8) is located on the south side of the berm within the ditched area; this test had a
slightly different profile and exposed the very dark gray silty clay underlain by dark
brown sandy clay between 16 and 35 cmbs. The lower two levels of ST 8 had a profile

22

similar to ST 7 with very dark gray mottled with the dark brown to 50 cmbs followed by
black clay to 110 cmbs.
South of site 41KF152, the survey corridor turned south. Shovel test 18 (ST18) was
excavated in this area and the soil profile consisted only of very dark gray sandy clay.
The only cultural remains discovered within the shovel test and the surrounding area
were small red-orange brick fragments. The ground visibility was moderate (30%) due to
rodent disturbance and dead grass caused by recent hay storage.
The survey corridor follows the ridge southeast toward Buffalo Creek where two shovel
tests (ST19 and ST20) were excavated before reaching a stock pond and levee adjacent to
the creek. Both contained sediment different than that identified in any portion of the
survey area so far and different than the Altoga Silty Clay reported by the SCS for the
area. Shovel test 19 exposed very dark gray sandy clay, dark reddish gray clay between
70 and 80 cmbs, followed by weak red and red clay to 90 cmbs. Shovel test 20 exposed
weak red sandy clay followed by reddish brown silty clay. As the pipeline corridor
continues towards Buffalo Creek, the terrain levels out and after crossing a levee, the
vegetation changes from an open pasture to a closed woods. Dense vegetation of junipers,
honey locusts, and green briars reached all the way to the creek edge and the creek
appears to have been channelized indicating a high probability of heavily disturbed soil
with low potential for cultural remains being intact.
Little Buffalo Creek to the Old Texas & Pacific Railroad Grade
Immediately south of Little Buffalo Creek the terrain appeared to have been invaded by
exotic vegetation within the last ten years based on a lack of large trees and the dense
honey locust growth. Ground visibility was poor (10-20%) through this part of the survey
corridor between the channelized Little Buffalo Creek and the Anthony Branch of the
creek. The dense vegetation continued south until a second levee was crossed south
Anthony Branch. Both Little Buffalo Creek and the Anthony Branch drainages have been
realigned due to levee construction based on both the 1936 and the 1961 highway maps.
The levees are still visible on aerial photographs of the area and no cultural remains were
identified where the creeks have cut new channels into the floodplain sediments located
immediately south of Little Buffalo Creek.
South of the levee, the pipeline corridor is typified by either improved pasture or plowed
fields currently being used for cotton or soybeans. This portion of the survey route
crosses floodplain deposits as evidenced by the twenty shovel tests (ST21-T40) and five
trenches (T1-T5) that were excavated between Buffalo Creek and the old Texas & Pacific
Railroad grade as labeled on the USGS topographic map. Shovel tests 20-27 (ST20ST27) exposed only black silty clay between the surface and where they were terminated
between 80 and 115 cmbs due to soil compaction. Ground visibility was highly variable
(10-75%) for 2.5 miles south of Buffalo Creek, where it consisted predominately of
improved pasture with ankle-high grass.

Visibility south of the pastures was excellent (Figure 10) for 7.2 miles until the corridor
reaches the old railroad grade. The ground was recently plowed; the only vegetation
present included small weeds, and the remnants of cotton and soybean crops. In addition,
the ground was recently further disturbed by pigs rooting in the ground to depths up to 30
cm. Very few knolls, rises or other landscape features were identified aside from river
and drainage channels.

Railroad berm. View is to the south

Although levees and channelization have moved the East Fork west from the pipeline
corridor, remnants of the pre-existing river channels still exist and provided the
possibility of sites being present. This portion of the survey area crosses the old channel
of the East Fork on two separate occasions, within 50 meters of the channel one
additional time, and crosses minor sloughs and creeks six times. Two prehistoric sites
were identified (41KF151 and 41KF153) in this portion of the survey area. Site
41KF153 is located on the east side of Pecan Slough on one of the few low rises located
within the floodplain. The site is mostly outside the survey corridor and only three
shovel tests (ST28-ST30) were excavated to determine the site boundary within the study
area. Only one shovel test (ST28) was positive for cultural materials. The Triple R site
(41KF151) is located adjacent to a raised two track field road along the pipeline corridor.
Eight shovel tests (ST31-ST38) and two trenches (T1 and T2) were excavated at the site
to determine site boundaries and deposit depth. Both sites were identified within plowed
fields where buried artifacts had been exposed. The sites are discussed in further detail

later. South of the Triple R site (41KF151), the pipeline corridor crosses an S bend in
Ezell Slough. Two shovel tests (ST39-ST40) were excavated adjacent to the slough and
exposed only very dark gray to dark grayish brown clays to depths up to 110 cmbs
followed by a dark grayish brown clay mottled with olive brown and very dark gray clay
to a total depth up to 125 cmbs.
The pipeline corridor crosses the old East Fork channel approximately 800 meters north
of the abandoned Texas & Pacific Railroad grade. Three trenches (T3-T5) were
excavated at the channel crossing to explore for buried prehistoric archaeological site
deposits adjacent to the creek. Trench three (T3) was oriented north-south approximately
10 meters north of the current water level in the old channel. The trench was seven
meters long and excavated to a depth of 330 cmbs. Four different zones were uncovered.
The B-horizon identified within the trench began at zone three at a depth of 100 cmbs.
Zones one and two consisted of black and very dark gray Trinity silty clay floodplain
deposits. Zone three consisted of a dark grayish brown mottled with dark yellowish
brown clay with abundant calcium carbonate deposits between 150 and 215 cmbs.
Within this same zone, a possible piece of bois dâarc wood between 150 and 200 cmbs,
and mussel shells scattered through the zone were identified (Figure 11).The wood is
possibly a fence post fragment based on the end being sawed flat. Zone four was between
314 and 330 cmbs and consisted of dark gray and brown mottled clay. The mussel shells
are small in size and showed no evidence of having been modified by man.

Trenches four (T4) and five (T5) were placed in a perpendicular line on the south side of
the channel. Trench four was located eight meters south of the current waterâs edge and
extended for three and a half meters; trench five was located 16 meters from the waterâs
edge and extended for four meters. Trench four was excavated first and mapped to
determine zones. Trench four exposed four zones. Zones one, two, and three consisted of
very dark gray to black silty clays typical of the Trinity floodplains to a depth of 200
cmbs. Zone four encountered the B-horizon and extended to a depth of 264 cmbs where
the trench was terminated. This lower zone consisted of dark reddish gray silty clay with
up to 10% calcium carbonate. Trench four was negative for cultural materials and it was
determined that an additional trench further from the waterâs edge might have a better
possibility of locating a buried prehistoric site deposit. Trench five was excavated five
meters south of trench four. This trench was excavated to the B-horizon before it was
terminated and determined to have the same zones as Trench four. Trench five was also
devoid of cultural materials. The two trenches provided a thorough search up to twenty
meters from the waterâs edge and a depth of 260 cmbs to explore for the presence of
buried prehistoric cultural materials.
Immediately north of the old Texas & Pacific Railroad berm, the ground had been cleared
and covered with gravel to accommodate the usage of the area for gravel production by
the Latimore Materials Company, L.P. The railroad grade is recognized as a large berm
and has been cut within this area to accommodate a road wide enough for large gravel
trucks to access Highway 37 to the south. About 1200 feet of the pipeline corridor is to be
placed within the gravel sorting and parking area where it veers around east then south of
the buildings and crosses the berm on the west side of the road. Although there were
many broken rocks within this portion of the survey corridor, they were attributed to the
recent use of heavy equipment, and gravel used to cover the clay sediment. The gravels
were not recognized as being culturally significant.
Texas & Pacific Railroad Berm to proposed Pump Station Site
South of the railroad grade, the pipeline corridor turns west away from the road cut and is
routed on the south side parallel to the berm for a mile before it turns north and once
again crosses the railroad berm. This portion of the corridor appears to have been
previously disturbed by berm construction and power line installation; two shovel tests
(ST 41 and ST42) were excavated on low hills located within the survey corridor. Shovel
test 41 consisted of a strong brown sandy loam typical of the Styx Series soils identified
by the SCS; shovel test 42 consisted of dark brown sandy loam consistent with the Lufkin
Series soils identified as being in the area. Visibility of this area was moderate (30-75%)
based on grass cover and a large quantity of hog disturbed land (Figure 12).
After the pipeline turns north again, the survey route crosses the railroad berm then
immediately drops into a drainage likely created when the berm was built. The berm and
drainage areas have heavy tree and foliage coverage before it clears again near a two
track road. This road crosses a shallow pool of water, which roughly parallels the main
stem of the Trinity, and which may constitute an abandoned cutoff river channel. The
possible channel is less than a meter deep and between three and four meters wide, and a

single shovel test was placed on either side of the channel. The shovel test on the east
side of the channel (ST43) contained a soil profile generally consisting of gray and
grayish brown clays and silty clays, with mottled clay subsoil and some calcium
carbonate. The shovel test excavated to the west of the drainage (ST44) encountered
more typical alluvial flood deposits of brown and yellowish brown silty or clayey silty,
overlain by similar gray and grayish brown clays. No cultural resources were located in
either shovel test.

Figure 12.

View south of the Texas & Pacific Railroad berm. The brown spots in
grass cover are areas of hog damage. View is to the west.

Once the pipeline corridor reaches the two track road it turns westerly again and follows
the road into the vicinity of the Trinity River Lock and Dam #7 (41KF150) that was built
in the early 20th century. The pipeline corridor turns north just before it reaches the site of
the proposed pump station, which is north of the Lock and Dam #7 site. One shovel test
(ST45) was placed in the proposed pipeline route; it exposed dark yellowish brown
clayey loam followed by very dark silty clay. No cultural resources were encountered.
Following the two track road the ground visibility is fair between 20 and 30 percent.
Two eight inch auger tests from geotechnical testing were discovered along the survey
route; they were mechanically excavated to a depth of 4 meters. The auger holes were not
excavated by ARC and were left open with the back dirt exposed on the surface. No
cultural materials were identified at either auger hole. Where the pipeline corridor
separates from the two track road the ground has been recently disturbed by clearing, the
piles of cleared brush and trees still exist and sediment removed was still visible around
the exposed roots. Grass cover had already begun to grow within the area again and
ground visibility was between 30 and 50 percent.

Site Descriptions
Site 41KF152
Site 41KF152 is located on the north side of what appears to be a man-made berm
between Lewis Road on the north and a hill slope on the south (Figure 13). The nearest
natural water source is an intermittent drainage located approximately 180 meters to the
west. A fence on top of the berm separates the floodplain and the hill slope. The site is
likely part of the hill slope that has been cut out to create a ditch and piled up to create the
berm (Figure 14). The site is about 3 meters wide by 22 meters long determined by
shovel tests and the surface scatter.

Figure 13.

Site 41KF152 on a section of the Scurry, Texas 7.5â USGS map.

The site is identified on the basis of ten surface artifacts, a single unidentified dart point
(Figure 15), a quartzite core, mussel shells, and bone fragments. Nine shovel tests (ST9ST17) were dug to test the site deposit and determine the site boundaries. A single
quartzite cobble core from 80 cm in shovel test 10 was the only subsurface artifact found.
Approximately 80 meters southwest of the site on the hill slope, there is an area with
large cobbles washing out of the ditch wall. The cobbles are fine-grained quartzite and
appear to be the same material observed in lithic artifacts from the site. Two shovel tests
(ST16 and ST17) were excavated into the hill slope adjacent to the cobbles to determine
the possibility of cultural materials being present. Both shovel tests were negative and
exposed dark grayish brown sandy clay with pebbles between 1 and 5 cm in diameter
located within the top 50 cmbs. Shovel test 15 was also excavated into the hill slope

immediately adjacent to the lithic scatter to determine site boundaries; it has similar soils
without the gravel inclusions, however it exposed dark yellowish brown sandy clay
between 61 and 108 cmbs. Four shovel tests (ST9, ST10, ST12, and ST13) were located
on the berm to determine soil composition and site boundaries. These shovel tests
revealed brown to very dark grayish brown sandy clay similar to that located in the hill
slope shovel tests.

Figure 14.

Site 41KF152 plan map.

Two additional shovel tests (ST11 and ST14) were excavated within the low spots on
either side of the berm. The shovel test on the northwest side (ST11) exposed very dark
gray silty clay. The other shovel test (ST14) located on the southeast side of the site
exposed yellowish brown sandy clay consistent with the lowest level of ST 15. This site
is not recognized as having any potential for inclusion in the NRHP and would be
ineligible for SAL designation as it appears to be a totally disturbed surface deposit.

Site 41KF151
Site 41KF151 is located on a low knoll overlooking Pecan Slough (Figures 16, 17). The
site is within a soybean field that was recently plowed. Ground visibility at the site was
very good (90-100%) (Figure 18). Pecan Slough is approximately 50 meters west of the
site. Most of the archaeological site, as a surface scatter, lies east of the pipeline survey
corridor and shovel testing was only conducted within the corridor. Based on surface
artifact locations, the site measures 82 meters east/west by 196 meters north/south. The
site is located on a flattened or buried knoll based on an aerial photograph taken after
recent plowing.

Artifacts identified in the surface scatter included lithic debris, a broken Gary point and a
possible Catahoula arrow point (Figures 19 and 20), a biface, burned clay fragments, and
a large cobble with flake scars on one edge. All of the identified lithics were quartzite,
and the lithic debris consisted primarily of primary and secondary flakes. This site does
not appear to have naturally occurring cobbles indicating that most of the lithics
encountered were imported from the adjacent uplands to the east.
The pipeline corridor is routed along the west edge of the site. Three shovel tests were
excavated (ST28-ST30), two were negative. The positive shovel test (ST28) contained a
single cracked quartzite rock that may have been broken prehistorically. The shovel tests
were terminated between 50 and 100 cm based on soil compaction. None of the shovel
tests penetrated the black and dark grayish brown Trinity clay. This site is primarily
located outside the pipeline corridor and is not recommended as having potential for the
NRHP and would be ineligible for SAL designation.

Triple R Campsite (41KF153)
The Triple R site (41KF153) is located in the East Fork floodplain where levees have
protected the area for farming (Figure 21). The closest natural water to the site is Pecan
Slough which is approximately 600 meters northwest and the Old Channel of the East
Fork 1 km east. The site is approximately 71 meters north-south by 36 meters east- west,
and is not on any observable rises or knolls; however, the site has been bisected by a two
track raised road that runs north-south (Figure 22). Road construction may have
borrowed sediment from the surrounding area allowing for plowing to bring artifacts up
from a buried site deposit. The site and surrounding area were newly plowed and had
excellent visibility (90-100 percent) at the time of the survey.

Figure 21.

Site 41KF153 on a section of the Scurry, Texas 7.5â USGS map.

Eight shovel tests (ST31-ST38) and two trenches (T1 and T2) were excavated to
determine site boundaries and depth. The surface scatter consisted of a Gary point (Figure
23), a biface fragment, and more than 20 pieces of lithic debris. Only two of the shovel
tests were positive (ST35 and ST36) and revealed flakes between 30 and 40 cmbs, at the
beginning of a sediment color change at approximately 30 cmbs. Shovel test 36 consisted
of typical very dark gray silty clay Trinity floodplain deposits between 1-35 cmbs,
transitioning into mottled dark grayish brown silty clay before reaching olive brown clay
that began at 80 cmbs. Shovel test 35 had a similar profile but was terminated between 90
and 105 cmbs when it reached mottled dark grayish brown and olive brown clay. Four of
the shovel tests (ST33, ST34, ST37, and ST38) exposed the dark grayish brown sediment

similar to the artifact bearing zone of the previous tests between 50 and 70 cmbs but
negative of any cultural materials. The final two shovel tests 31 and 32 did not exhibit the
same soil profile and contained only black and very dark gray Trinity floodplain
sediments to a depth of 170 and 80 cmbs respectively.

Figure 22.

Triple R site (41KF153) base map.

Two trenches were excavated (T1 and T2) to determine cultural deposit depth and extent
of the site. The trenches were located east of ST 35, north of ST36 and south of ST33;
they were oriented in line north to south with trench one being on the north. Trench one
was 380 cm long and 204 cm deep, the B-horizon was reached at approximately 173
cmbs as black clay mottled with grayish brown clay. A total of four zones were identified
ending with mottled pale brown and light brown clay in Zone four between 198 and 204
cmbs. Trench one contained no cultural materials. Trench two was located three meters
south of trench one and consisted of a very different soil profile. Trench two had three
observed zones; the first consisted of very dark gray silty clay to a depth of 26 cmbs. One
quartzite flake was discovered in the first zone. Zone two marked the B-horizon and
consisted of light olive brown clay mottled with dark gray clay to a depth of 65 cmbs.
Mussel shell fragments were found scattered through this layer but no cultural materials
were present. Zone three consisted of grayish brown clay to a depth of 133 cmbs and
contained no cultural materials.

Gary point discovered at the Triple R site (41KF153)

Shovel tests along with trenches excavated at the site suggest that the site originated as a
buried deposit located on a buried or flattened knoll possibly adjacent to a channel that
has since filled in with the floodplain deposits. The site is likely Late Archaic in age
based on the discovery of a Gary point but no additional dateable materials were
discovered. This site is not recognized as having potential for inclusion on the NRHP and
would be ineligible for SAL designation.
Trinity Lock and Dam #7 Site (41KF150)
The Trinity Lock and Dam #7 site (41KF150) was constructed across the Trinity River
channel between 1916 and 1918 for the purpose of maintaining a constant water level
upstream while at the same time providing for downstream flowage (Figure 24). The goal
was to allow boats to carry supplies, agricultural products, and people between Dallas
and Trinity Bay. The area of the site is shown in Figure 25 includes several features
which are described below and which are then related to structures shown in a series of
historic photographs taken during the construction period. The most prominent feature at
the site is the lock and dam which is shown on the aerial photograph although the eastern
half of the lock is almost totally obscured by floodplain sediments. As shown on the site
map (Figure 26), the northeast and southeast ends of the lock are barely visible in the
river bank. The ramped structure is included in a roughly circular tree concentration
located east of the lock and dam and the concrete footings of a formerly elevated
structure are located in a smaller tree concentration situated north of the ramped structure.

Six additional concrete piers are located on the river edge and may mark the only
evidence that remains of a second structure that was built on top of the piers. The pump
station site was to be located north of the site and construction of the pipeline and the
pump station were not to have impacted any parts of the site.

3.2 acres. The western end of the dam is shown in Figure 27 and it appears that the river
has eroded the river bank and left the anchoring end of the dam isolated inside the
channel. The channel bottom is shallow downstream from the dam on the western side
and this would not have been allowed boats to pass through the lock and dam structure
had a second lock been on the western end of the dam. The photograph shows a metal
bypass gate in place that is the only remaining evidence of the movable structure that was
on the top of the concrete dam. A tiled water gauge scaled in feet is located in the
upstream corner of the concrete embankment. The west side of the dam was not mapped
during survey due to limited access but was included within the overall site boundaries
based on aerial photographs.

wall. Note the presence of the tiled water gauge and the still standing
bypass gate.

The area between the two lock walls is filled with sediment to the point that less than half
of the lock is visible. However, the northern and southern ends outside of the lock gates
are open and the western upper gate is obviously open. Several of the control
mechanisms used for gate movement are also visible (Figures 28 and 29). Three tiedowns are anchored in the upper surface of the lock on the river side. The river side has a

dip of approximately 75 degrees from the lock top (Figure 30). The western side of the
lock structure is 245 feet long and 24 feet wide.
The second structure recorded at the site consists of a single ramped aggregate concrete
foundation with a disintegrated stone retaining wall around the base. It is oriented such
that the ramp is perpendicular to the long axis of the lock. The structure appears to be
mostly intact but is heavily overgrown with vines and young trees (Figure 30). The
platform stands four feet high with three visible step type levels on the retaining wall.
The platform is 41 ft by 27 ft and appeared to be constructed of dirt fill covered with
aggregate concrete. The ramp is 13 ft wide by 31 ft long and enters the platform from the
southwest. No building remnants were visible either on top of or around the platform.

gate, is shown in the foreground. The west end of the dam is in the

The remaining structures consist of two sets of rebar reinforced concrete piers. The larger
structure has 33 vertical piers that stick up from the ground approximately four feet.
Thirty one of the piers are square with 18 in sides, one of the piers is L-shaped with 3 ft
sides and 18 in thick, and the last one is a solid 3 ft by 3 ft square (Figure 32). The piers
are reinforced with either plain square or Damascus twist rebar (Friedman 1995:108,
Skinner and Trask 2011). The Damascus rebar is a style that was used in the early 1900s
and was abandoned about 1920 (Figure 33). A circular corrugated metal structure with a
square concrete foundation is also present on the east side of the piers (Figure 34). The
only artifacts identified around the large collection of piers were a few brick portions
with ATLAS impressed into them (Figure 35). Atlas had manufacturing plants in both
Dallas and Ferris near the turn of the 20th century; by 1914 Ferris was producing bricks
that are known to have the ATLAS stamp on them (Graves 1996:395, 396; Atkinson
2012). The Atlas bricks were the only artifacts found on the surface, this could be due in
part to silting. Almost a meter of fill is present at the western part of the lock and the
same amount of sediment may have been deposited across the floodplain.

The second structure consists of a series of six piers of similar dimensions and
construction as the small piers located within the larger pier structure. The smaller pier
structure is located on the river bank, and the piers are situated so that they form an L
with 5 piers oriented north to south and one additional pier on the west side of the north
most pier. The piers are spaced three feet apart. The ground around the sixth pier is
partially eroded away so the subsurface pier foundation is partially visible within the
river bank. It is likely that these piers are part of what was once a larger structure that has
eroded into the river
Background research on the Trinity River Lock and Dam #7 has identified a series of
photographs taken between 1914 and 1918 at various stages during construction. Figure
36 was taken from the east bank of the river on June 24, 1918. This was near the end of
construction. The northern end of the lock is shown and it is apparent that the east side of
the lock is wider and more massive than the western part which is the only part of the
lock that is uncovered at the present time. The lock gates are closed in the picture and a
small barge is upstream. The west end of the dam appears to have been completed except
for the moveable metal gates. White rock riprap had been placed upslope from the
concrete structure. A pile of unused rock is situated on the edge of the adjacent
floodplain.

This photograph of the unfinished Lock and Dam #7 was taken on March
19, 1917. It shows two elevated structures on the eastern floodplain.

The east side of the lock and dam were photographed on March 19, 1917 (Figure 37) and
at that time the concrete structure appeared to be in roughly the same condition as a year
later. Of interest is the concrete-covered river bank upstream from the eastern part of the
lock as well as several buildings on the floodplain to the east. The building immediately
east is better shown on Figure 38. This apparently 1 Â½ story high storage building has a
wide front door situated at the top of the ramp and is resting on a cemented stone
foundation. The structure is situated on the top of a tiered foundation.
The second elevated structure shown in Figure 37 appears to have been a residence or an
office that was elevated on concrete piers. This is shown as an apparently white structure
on the right hand side of Figure 39. Two additional structures are shown to the north and
the smaller one which is close to the river bank may correspond to the location of where
six concrete piers were recorded. A second building is located between the two elevated
structures shown and it is a frame building that may have been constructed on the ground
surface. This picture may have been taken when the dam gates were being installed near
the end of construction.

The site is one of about a dozen locks and dams that were built in the early 1900s as part
of the Trinity River Navigation Project to provide river transportation to the Dallas area
(Gard 2011). By 1921, project complications and money demands stripped the project of
its federal funding and it was effectively abandoned (Durham 1976:90-93). The project
was eventually abandoned and never completed but it represents a significant attempt at
opening up additional trade routes to the region. Additional research will be required
before the Lock and Dam #7 site including the associated ramped platform and the pier
structures can be considered eligible for inclusion the NRHP or to be eligible for SAL
designation.

Conclusions

Prehistoric archaeological sites in the lower East Fork Valley have been found buried in
floodplain sediments, on the surface of generally low knolls in the floodplain, and on
terraces and ridges at the valley edge. The Mainstem survey recorded sites in two of these
settings, the valley slope and on a low knoll in the floodplain adjacent to a now
intermittent tributary. A third site, a scattered low density lithic accumulation, found on
the floodplain surface was also recorded and this was considered an unusual site location,
unless it had a buried site deposit. No strong evidence of a buried site deposit was found
at the site. All three sites were occupied during the Late Archaic and site 41KF151 was
also occupied during the Late Prehistoric period. The floodplain and slope sites are small
in area and the scattered artifact assemblages consisted almost exclusively of lithic
debris. Besides dart points, no chipped or ground stone tools or pottery were found. Site
41KF151 is a larger site that may have functioned as a more permanent but temporarily
occupied camp similar to the unrecorded prehistoric site located on the Sand Hill knoll.
Both floodplain sites and sites including X41KF6 (Richner 1976:16) would have been cut
off from the upland during seasonal flooding. Therefore it is predicted that permanent
campsites would be found at higher elevations in and adjacent to the floodplain where
upland access was possible year round and also where potable water was always
available. The Gilkey Hill site fits this description but no recorded sites in the lower East
Fork valley match it and an effort to locate and evaluate such sites needs to be done. No
evidence of older or younger Native American occupation was encountered during the
survey.
Sites attributed to transporting goods and people are the only major historic sites noted to
be present in the survey area. This is to be expected because occupation in the floodplain
was and remains limited by seasonal flooding, furthermore, the floodplain soils have been
intensively farmed and not lived on for more than a century. Earthen berms which once
supported railroad tracks and roads crossed the East Fork valley on the north and south
ends of the pipeline route but no houses were found in the vicinity of the pipeline route.
No features or artifacts associated with the railroads were encountered during the survey.
The only other historic site is the Lock and Dam #7 that was built during the second
decade of the 1900s and was never used on a permanent basis. The site is similar to Lock

& Dam #1 in Dallas County (Kosloff and Bruseth 1982:15-18). Like the railroads, the
purpose of the lock and dam was to assist in the transport of goods and people (Saunders
1991), not to establish residences in the East Fork floodplain although workers certainly
lived in the area during construction and may have left some features/artifacts buried
below the present ground surface in the vicinity of the structural evidence of the site.
Navigation on the Trinity River was at its peak between 1865 and 1878. Efforts to make
the river reliably navigable continued up to the late 1900s although navigation was never
successful. The potential significance of the Trinity Navigation Project and the remains
of the locks and dams has been recognized (Reese, Pegues, and Yates 1988) but further
investigations are needed before any of these resources are recommended for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places or designated as a State Archaeological
Landmark.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The 45 shovel tests and five trenches excavated during survey of the pipeline route have
demonstrated that historic and prehistoric archaeological sites are present in and on the
abundant floodplain sediments. AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that if the pipeline is
to be built in the future, additional trenching should be conducted at the drainage
southeast of the Lock and Dam #7 site. Furthermore, additional shovel tests and trenching
should also be conducted along the portion of the pipeline route adjacent to the Lock and
Dam #7 site to demonstrate that the site does not extend into the pipeline corridor and
that there will be no negative effects to the site during construction.
The Lock and Dam #7 site (41KF150) was built as part of the Trinity River Navigation
Project in the early 20th century. The site is regionally significant because it represents a
substantial attempt at making water transportation from the Gulf coast to the Dallas area a
reality. The lock and large portions of the site has been silted over by approximately a
meter of sediment, and erosion has already had an effect on the site as evidenced by one
of the pier structures. Independent research aside from the pipeline project should be
conducted to determine the full horizontal extent of the site, the extent of erosion damage,
and to assess the possibility of site excavation or stabilization prior to further degradation.
Additional research would also be useful to determine eligibility of the site for inclusion
in the NRHP, SAL designation, or the Historic American Engineering Record.
The three prehistoric sites (41KF151, 41KF152, and 41KF153) recorded during survey
have been determined to be highly disturbed within the pipeline corridor due to farming
and land modification. Therefore, they are considered not eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP or for SAL designation. AR Consultants, Inc. requests that the Texas Historical
Commission concur with our recommendations.
