Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint and access right-of-way of
the proposed TX 16609-B Masterbilt Cellular Tower site in northwestern Hansford County,
Texas. The Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA;
47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an
undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent review of this archaeological
report was provided by the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeology Division. The total area
to be impacted is 10,000 square feet (<0.23 acres), in addition to a 20-foot wide Access/Utility
Easement, and three 40-foot Guy Wire Easements.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on January 6, 2015. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

(TAAI) to conduct
an archaeological
investigation of the
proposed tower site.

funding was involved in the proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking.
In December 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or
within one mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area.
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area.

apparently been used primarily as farmland and pasture.

Project Environment
The Project Area lies within the northwestern portion of Hansford County, in the northern Texas
Panhandle, within the Great Plains region, in the High Plains area. The topography of Hansford
county is typically rolling prairies cut by Frisco, Coldwater, and Horse creeks; all intermittently
flowing during infrequent periods of heavy rainfall. Elevation in Hansford County ranges from
about 2,900 feet in the southeast, to roughly 3,300 feet in the northwestern portion. The modern
climate of the Project Area is classified as semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall of just over
22 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year, with average daily
maximum temperatures averaging about 94 degrees in July, to around 20 degrees in January. The
combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in frequent droughts as well as
periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of roughly 186 days (Anderson 1996;
Welker et al. 1960).
Soils
About 60 percent of the county is covered with non-calcareous upland slope soils away from the
Caprock and valley breaks. Roughly 13 percent of the soils in Hansford County are classified as
calcareous and shallow upland soils that are present on the broad divides between Palo Duro
Creek and its major tributaries. Approximately 10 percent of the county lies on the rough
escarpments along Coldwater Creek and Palo Duro Creek and their tributaries. Soils in these
dissected area consists of highly calcareous, shallow, and eroded rough land soils on steep slopes
near the Caprock edge. Finally, soils in the valley lands of Coldwater Creek and Palo Duro Creek
and their tributaries cover about 17 percent of Hansford County. These are classified as alluvial
in nature, but subject to significant erosion and shifting due to the rapid seasonal runoffs that are
common (Welker et al. 1960).
As shown in Figure 4, the TX 16609-B Masterbilt Tower and its three Guys will impact Sherm
silty clay loam (ShA),very deep soils commonly on nearly level to gently sloping eolian plains in
this area of Hansford County. Sherm series soils formed in loamy and clayey eolian sediments of
Pleistocene age.
A typical soil pedon of Sherm series silty clay loam from 0-8 inches below the surface consists
of brown silty clay loam that is slightly hard, friable, non-calcareous, and exhibits vertical cracking
when dry. From 8-18 inches is brown silty clay with a prismatic structure transitioning to strong,
medium, angular, blocky. It is very hard, with common distinct clay films and common pressure
faces on peds. Vertical cracking is common when dry, and the soil in this zone is slightly
calcareous and moderately alkaline.
From 18 to 28 inches below the surface one would expect to see brown clay with a prismatic
structure as well as strong, medium, blocky. As with the zone above, it is also very hard and
3

cracks vertically when dry. The ped faces exhibit common distinct clay films and pressure faces.
It is also slightly calcareous and moderately alkaline. From about 28-49 inches below the surface
is reddish yellow silty clay with a prismatic and medium, angular, blocky structure. As with the
above zones, this one is also very hard, with common distinct clay films on ped faces, but
becomes highly calcareous and moderately alkaline.
Roughly from 49-60 inches below the surface, this zone is pink clay with a subangular blocky
structure and is slightly hard and friable. With a few faint clay films on the ped faces, it is
comprised of calcium carbonate masses, nodules, and finely disseminated carbonates probably 60
percent by volume. Accordingly, this subsoil is very strongly calcareous and strongly alkaline.
From approximately 60-80 inches below the surface should be reddish yellow clay that exhibits
a weak subangular blocky structure, is slightly hard and friable, and has distinct clay films on the
ped faces. It is estimated that calcium carbonate masses, nodules, and finely disseminated
carbonates make up 35 percent by volume. And, as would be expected, this lower subsoil is also
very strongly calcareous and strongly alkaline (Welker et al. 1960: Websoil Survey Online 2014).

Cultural Chronology
The location of the TX 16609-B Masterbilt Cellular Tower survey area presumes cultural
affinities and influences from the Southern Great Plains (Figure 5). Several scholars have offered
sound but differing arguments for cultural chronologies for the Southern Great Plains extending
into northern Texas. The cultural chronology, defined by complex (in lieu of the terms phase,
interval, or period) of the North American High Plains has been synthesized by Hofman et al.
(1989), and more recently, the Southern High Plains in Texas by Johnson and Holliday (1995)
and Boyd (1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by
shifts in climatic conditions and subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are
indicators of change in central and south Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived
from Johnson and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are
approximate and given as years before present (B.P.).
Pre-Clovis
Although humans may
have inhabited the
landscape before 11,500
B.P, solid evidence does
not support their
existence. Although
human behavior is
inferred on stone
artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site
(Fox et al. 1992:51-73),
all are problematic. At
Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of
north-central Texas,
r a d i o c a r b on date s
initially believed to be
from burned charcoal in
human campfires, and
approximating an
antiquity of 40,000 years
were later disproved as
dates on natural coal Figure 5. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from
( S t a n f o r d Black 1989a).
1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic
proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on
5

stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and
with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances
of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains
were occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people
who made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented
the presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include
bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called "Goshen" may be present (Hofman 1989:34; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in
Bell County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940),
archaeological evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either
extinct or otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer,
antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman
6

1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano
Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of
megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic
hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game
hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas,
such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were
small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed
and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the
inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants and animals which would produce the same
amount of calories and protein with the same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile
points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues that the area was used more frequently in the
Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of bison and other
game animals on the Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that population densities
were low during this period, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
"few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on diffuse
utilization of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and
lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285).
Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains
decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation
of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut
harvests in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black
1989a). Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the
acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and
processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt
this conclusion (e.g., Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock
7

middens are still a matter of controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach
and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus
seems to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other
plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds
of accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological
community, but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about
4500 B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites,
at least in the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as
the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or
fell during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of
burned rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the
Blue Hole site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32
(Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens
at Camp Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County
(Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in
diameter were still very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have
become less specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base
(Black 1989b:30). Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains
area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the
Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story
(1985:44-45) believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981),
Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968a, b), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt
8

(1980) further posits that population in the Hansford County area peaked during the Late Archaic
with groups moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found
in the region were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points. The most common are
Ensor and Frio types, both of which are short, triangular points with side notches. The Frio point
also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt
(1980) presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's
(1974) contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes,
which also lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.
Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits mark the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including
the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and
the northern South Texas Plain (Black 1989b:32; Story 1985:45-47). Two complexes following
the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from about
2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts
into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977;
Skinner 1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into
the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to
Hurt (1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is
mirrored in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due
to the increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited
European contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The
cultural context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence
of outside ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos
9

and Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed
in many sources (e.g., Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975;
Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan
Apache, and Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989;
Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on
the Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994;
Johnson and Campbell 1992).
Hansford County History
“An Apachean culture occupied the Panhandle-Plains area in prehistoric times; the modern
Apaches emerged subsequently but were pushed out of the region about 1700 by the Comanches,
who dominated the area until the mid-1870s. During the early 1870s buffalo hunters traversed the
area from the east, slaughtering the great southern herd as they went. In 1873 James H. Cator and
his brother Robert, both buffalo hunters from England, established an outpost in what became
Hansford County. They named this semipermanent camp Zulu, and it soon became known as Zulu
Stockade. Over the next four years the buffalo were wiped out. In the Red River War of 1874 the
Comanches were conquered; they were removed to Indian Territory in 1875 and 1876".
“In 1876 the Texas legislature marked off Hansford County from land previously assigned to
Young and Bexar districts; the new county was administered by authorities in Wheeler County.
By 1880 the United States census counted eighteen people living in the county. That same year
the county's first town, Farwell, was established near the center of the county; in 1887 Hansford,
a stage stop on the old Tascosa-Dodge City Trail, was established near Farwell on Palo Duro
Creek. In 1889, when the county was politically organized, Hansford outpolled Farwell in a
county-seat election”.
“Though ranching early became the mainstay of the county's economy, it did not develop as
quickly or on as large a scale as in other counties of the western and southern Panhandle. After
1900 farmers began to move in. Land speculation and the foundation of several local land
companies after 1900 led to the arrival of both Anglo-American and immigrant farmers. By 1910
Hansford County had 152 farms and ranches and the population had increased to 935. Crop
farming was slowly being established. By 1920, 221 farms and ranches had been established in
10

the county, and almost 32,500 acres was devoted to wheat culture”.
“In 1920 the North Texas and Santa Fe Railway built a line from Shattuck, Oklahoma, to its new
townsite of Spearman in southeastern Hansford County, and more and more farmers arrived to
buy promising lands. Spearman soon became the leading town in the county, and in 1929 it
became the county seat. In the late 1920s the Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railway built
southward from Liberal, Kansas, to Amarillo. Construction of the Rock Island line across the
county led to the foundation in 1927 of Gruver, a railroad and farming community that eventually
became the second largest town in the county. In 1931, the Santa Fe Railroad extended its line
from Spearman to the southern edge of the county to link up with the Rock Island. The two
railroads joined at a new townsite, Morse, which had been laid out in 1928. In the 1920s and
afterward a highway system was developed within the county to supplement the railroads. In
1927 only one state highway, running north from Spearman to Guymon, Oklahoma, crossed the
county; only dirt roads connected Spearman to Stratford, Perryton, and Dumas. By the end of
the 1940s, however, a network of farm roads crisscrossed the county, and paved State highways
117 and 282 (now 15 and 207) linked Hansford County to the rest of the state”.
“Oil was discovered in Hansford County in 1937, and significant production began in the 1950s.
By the 1980s Hansford County had a diversified economy based on agriculture, oil, and
transportation. The diversification of the county's economy after World War II led to a substantial
increase in population between 1940 and 1970” (Anderson 1996:444-445).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results

A review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the TX 16609-B Masterbilt Cellular Tower site had
not been subjected to a cultural resources survey, nor were there any documented archaeological
surveys, no known archaeological sites, historic structures, nor historical markers within one mile
(Atlas 2014; see also, Figure 3).
As of December 22, 2014 there were 131 documented archaeological sites in Hansford County,
and together they begin to convey a glimpse of how the landscape may have been exploited over
the past several millennia in the area. It is evident that humans have lived in the area from the
Paleoindian period, perhaps as long as 11,500 years ago. Notably, legendary Panhandle Plains
archaeologist Jack Hughes had a hand in documenting the first 78 archaeological sites in Hansford
County during a survey of the Palo Duro Reservoir area in 1978. Also of note is that Alibates
chert and bison bones are common to many of the sites in the county.
Of the 131 sites, 84 are prehistoric open campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian through
the early Historic periods; two of which contain human burial remains. Twenty-three of the 131
documented sites have been classified as prehistoric lithic scatters. Other prehistoric components
include five rockshelters, two rock cairns, and four bison kill and processing sites.

11

Numerous early historic sites in the county include 1800s ranch headquarters and farmstead
remains, dugouts, wagon cuts, rock corrals, a late 1800s townsite and cemetery, the Bushman
Stage Stop on the Tascosa to Dodge City Trail (1879-1912), the Palo Duro School (1896-1936),
and multiple 1800s and 1900s trash scatters.
Eligible National Register Properties in Hansford County include historic Indian pictographs,
multiple prehistoric open campsites, a rock cairn, a rock corral, and a bison kill and processing
site (Atlas 2014).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
Prior to the archaeological survey, the area to be impacted had been clearly delineated with survey
stakes (see for example, Figure 6). In Accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough
pedestrian survey of the delineated tract was conducted. Soils matrices from the six shovel tests
(STs) were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with a designed research plan,
all redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be
placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. Excavation of the shovel tests were
terminated at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs).

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
The tower footprint area and guy locations had obviously been disturbed by the cultivation and
sowing of a winter wheat field. As shown in Figures 6 and 7, surface visibility ranged between
80-100 percent across the site, and the entryway from CR 12 crosses a bladed bar ditch.
The surface examination revealed common fragmented, soft, and crumbly caliche. A total of six
shovel tests were placed within the tower’s footprint, access/utility easement from CR 12, and
the three guy locations (Figure 8). The results of all six shovel tests were generally generic in
terms of soils, sediments, and inclusions by level. That is, the upper 0-10 centimeters (cm)
exhibited few grass (winter wheat) rootlets within pale brown, crumbly and friable sandy clay
loam. Below that, from roughly 10-25 cm, we observed pale brown clay loam with vertical
cracking to 1/8" wide. The mid subsoil from 25-60 cm consisted of pinkish gray clay loam that
was more compact with depth, with a notable increase in calcium carbonate fines and clay with

13

depth, in addition to tiny, subangular caliche nodules pebbles roughly 5 percent by volume from
50-60 cm below the surface.
The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms, are on file at Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, and are available upon request. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface or in either of the six shovel tests.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
There are no known archaeological sites, historic structures, nor historic markers within the visual
APE of the proposed TX 16609-B Masterbilt Cell Tower site. A thorough pedestrian survey of
the surface within the Project Area was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated. No
evidence of neither prehistoric nor historic occupation was found either on or below the surface.
Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as
eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction
within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
