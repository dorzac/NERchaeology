Reconstruction

INTRODUCTION
This report details excavation, artifacts, and recommendations at the
McKinney Homestead and Mill (41TV289) located on the banks of Onion
Creek about 7.5 mi southeast of Austin (Travis County, Texas). Over 60
mandays were expended in efforts to remove the rubble overburden (wall
fall) from the three room house and explore the deposit of the mill wheel
house in an effort to determine the motive power of the mill. About 40 cu m
of overburden was removed from the house and 20 cu m of deposit was excavated in the mill wheel house during the months of September and October 1974.
The primary emphasis is to make architectural recommendations to Texas
Parks and Wildlife architects and describe those artifacts from the house
which were not covered in previous work. Only brief attempts are made to
describe the architecture and setting as full descriptions are in the main
body.
ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Previous Investigations
Previous investigations within~ McKinney Falls State Park area concentrated on prehistoric archeological sites (Suhm, 1955, 1957) or surveys and
minor testing (Kegley, 1972; Ralph and Loving, 1973) designed to clear
areas for park development.
Extensive investigations at McKinney Falls State Park were undertaken by
the Texas Archeological Society from June 8 to June 15, 1974 during the
Society’s annual field school. The TAS work was focused on the historical
aspects of the park and concentrated on the McKinney Homestead com-

plex. During the field school, an intensive archeologica! survey was conducted in the park and a number of historic and prehistoric sites were
located and recorded.
Archeological prospecting was conducted around the McKinney house
and mill utilizing a proton magnetometer, metal detectors, and pH and
phosphate chemical tests. Excavations at the house consisted of a meter
wide trench along the inside east wall of the east room, a trench running east
from the southeast corner of the house, and a trench north from the north
wall or back of the house. Excavations in the east room produced burned
flooring, two possible floor joists, and miscellaneous artifacts. The two
trenchs outside of the house revealed foundation construction features and
a shallow occupation layer about 20 cm deep containing numerous artifacts,
including pressed glass, medicine bottles, metal artifacts, and ceramics.
Over 1300 man days went into this phase of research.
Excavations at the mill consisted of shallow cuts to define architectural
features and a deep cut into the wheel pit. The main structure and outlying
features were detailed with machinery related artifacts recovered in all
locales. The deep cut stopped short of the main turbin machinery due to
lack of time.
Emergency archeological investigations were directed by McEachern
(Hudson, ms) January 20-29, 1975, at site 41TV314, a large prehistoric
site located on park property. A significant portion of the site ~vas destroyed
during construction activities. Several additional sites were located during
this time.
Archeological excavations were directed by Roberson (Black, Appendix
B) at the horse trainer’s cabin (41TV307) during a five day period in July
1974, using Parks and Wildlife personnel and local volunteer amateur archeologists. A moderate collection of artifacts belonging mostly to the first
quarter of this century was recovered and architectural details were defined.
Additional surveys of the park were conducted by Calvert in an attempt to
relate various fences to historic structures; and by Medlin who attempted to
update all site survey forms. Field notes are on file at Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department.
Texas Parks and Wildlife Investigations
The Historic Sites and Restoration Branch of the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department conducted investigations at the Thomas F. McKinney House
and Mill to determine actual needs to stabilize and preserve the house before
the park was opened to the public. The field work was conduqted between
September 23 and October ,11, 1974, with a crew of four peolJle and occasional volunteers. Twenty ~ight mandays went into clearing and mapping
the house and 32 mandays ~(plus 8 mandays of volunteer labor) were utilized in removing fill in the mil! shaft. Work was carried out under Antiquities
Permit Number 53.
The Parks and Wildlife investigations of the house consisted of clearing
the rubble from the house down to the surface of the occupation zone. In
addition, two small test units were excavated into the occupation deposit.
When surface artifacts were encountered, they were placed in lots which
corresponded to general areas of the house (Fig. 1). The excavation grid
and elevation were established previously during the field school investiga-

148

tions and were based on Texas Parks and Wildlife Department monuments.
All work was conducted using metric units.

McKINNEY HOUSE ARCHITECTURE
The old McKinney House (41TV289) was a two-story, cutstone building
with three downstairs rooms (east, west, and middle), a front porch, and
supposedly a built-on smoker/kitchen (Figs. 14-20, main text). Work was
accomplished on the main house structure only. The rooms, porch, and
construction material were described in the main text.

McKINNEY HOUSE ARTIFACTS
Wood
The wood artifacts consist of fragments of joists and planks used in the
construction of the east room of the house. Most of the wood is burned or
badly decomposed; in only a few cases could the actual dimensions of the
boards be reconstructed.
JOISTS
Number of specimens: 4 fragments
Provenience: lots 6, 7, 8, 12
Description: All fragments covered are remains of second story joists which remained in
the joist pockets when the house burned. The joists are manufactured from logs; in
one case, finishing cuts occur on two sides at right angles to each other while the remaining logs were finished on only one side. The joists cut on one side are 15 cm
thick; the specimen finished on two sides is 11 cm.

BEAMS
Number of specimens: 1 fragment
Provenience: lot 12
Description: A fragment of one beam finished on three sides with the remaining side
burned was found in the porch area. Dimension of the intact side is 6.5 cm; the remaining side was greater than 6 cm.
Discussion: The original use of the beam in the construction of the house is unknown
but it could have been used as a first story joist.
PLANKS
Number of specimens: 16 fragments
Provenience: lot 12(7), 14(4), 15(2), 16(I), 22(2)
Description: The widest plank is 8 cm in width (not necessarily the actual width of the
original planks). Fragments are uniformally 2 cm thick.
Discussion: Plank fragments are assumed to be the remains of the second story floor.
MISCELLANEOUS BOARDS
Number of specimens: 4 fragments
Provenience: lot 4, 9, 15(2)
Description: Cut end fragments of four boards. Three have tapered cuts or tongues; the
remaining piece is beveled for use in a corner.
UNIDENTIFIED WOOD
Number of specimens: 16 fragments
Provenience: Lot 2, 3(2), 9(2), 10(2), 12(5), 14(2), 22(2)
Description: Too fragmentary for further comment.

Metal
NAILS
Of all the artifacts recovered, nails were the most common and divided into two classes: wire nails and cut nails. Nails were classified as to pennyweight (abbreviated d) when complete enough. There are a variety of diffe~’ent standards for length versus pennyweight (Table 1). Standards include: U.S. 1876, 1897, 1931 (Walker, 1971:69); Simmons (1884);
Baldwin (1891); and Unknown (Fontana and Greenleaf, 1962:56). The
1931 U.S. standard was used for wire nails and the 1876 U.S. standard for
cut nails. However, the house was constructed before the U.S. standards
were established. Lengths given show the variations in range that are normally expected in any manufacturing process (Table 1).

Wire Nails
Wire nails first came into use in the United States during the 1850’s
(Nelson, 1968). Earlier wire nails were popular in small sizes intended for
use in making cigar boxes and other items. These earlier nails had bulbous
heads and were generally eccentric in relation to their shanks. It was not until the 1890’s that wire nails became the predominate type. They have never
completely replaced cut nails which are still used for some purposes. Wire
nails from the house are all of the modern type (Table 2).
Cut Nails
Cut nails of the type found in the McKinney House were manufactured
from about 1830 to the

present (Table 3).

from 2.5 to 3.5 mm in thickness and are often fused into indistinguishable blobs from
fire.
Discussion: Window pane glass distribution followed the pattern established by the TAS
excavation (see main text).

Ceramics
Ceramic classification is based on three categories: I) hardness of paste as
reflected by its porosity; 2) color of paste; and 3) decoration. As much as
possible, the classification follows the basic rules listed by Powell
(1962:34-35). The small size of the collection makes a more refined
classification impossible.
The ceramics can be considered earthenwares based on hardness of
paste. (Lardner, 1832:67) and tongue test (Durrenberger, 1965:9). Eight of
the 10 sherds are of medium paste and considered cream colored wares.
The remaining sherds are hard paste of the ironstone type.

McKINNEY HOUSE RECONSTRUCTION
The builder’s trench was dug and the foundation of rough cut native
limestone was coursed up to grade. The first cutstone course was laid, tied
at the corners and cross-walls, and the doorsills were placed. Coursing continued as stone become available, resulting in differing craftsmanship from
area to area. Windows, opening inward, were enclosed and lintels placed as
the structure grew. Capping stones on the ends and two cross walls climbed
to the gabled roof beam. The intricate double fireplace with upstairs heater
kept pace with construction and became the stabilizing factor for the structure.
McKINNEY HOUSE

RECOMMENDATIONS

East Room
Set a stone larger than 110 x 15 x 15 cm inside and against the south
door. When finished with stabilization and repointing, fill with pea gravel,
about 20 cm deep (ca. 3.0 cu m). Scaffolding or booms used during
reconstruction must be blocked or placed on plywood to protect the archeological deposit. Excavation may not proceed below 157.19 meters
elevation without an archeologist present. If supervision is inadequate or
vandalism a problem, hurricane chain link fence can be overlapped on the
floor before adding the gravel.
Middle Room
It is recommended that a stone larger than the doorway be set just inside
the room as with the east room, and pea gravel (ca. 3.8 cu m) added after
stabilization and repointing. The wood floor must be protected from workers
and scaffolding by using plywood or blocks. Excavation shall not proceed
below 157.28 m elevation without an archeologist present.
West Room
It is recommended that excavation not occur in this room without an archeologist present. The standing walls require stabilization and the south,
west, and half of the north walls need rebuilding to at least a m high. Pea
gravel should be placed 15 to 20 cm thick in this room after stabilization and
rebuilding (ca. 5.5 cu m).
Porch Area
It is recommended that excavation not be attempted below the existing
ground surface and that the archeological fill be further protected from man
and nature by placing 15 cm of topsoil over the entire front (7.8 cu m) and a
cover crop planted to retard erosion.

Cistern
An open cistern immediately south of the house presents a special problem as it is very rich in artifacts and fauna and should not be disturbed.
Without disturbing the deposit, a locked grate should be placed over the
mouth to protect the public from accidental falls.
General
An archeologist must be present if any excavation is to be attempted
within 10 m of the house or mill. This presence is to insure the protection of
the known resources (cistern, piping, barn) and the unlocated resources
(slave quarters, slave cemetery, and dump). A parameter fence may be
necessary to protect the stabilized ruin from vandalism.

McKINNEY MILL
Architectural Summary
The complex consists of a dam, mill race, penstock, wheel house, and
tailrace. The superstructure, possibly two story, straddled the
penstock/wheel house pit while pilaster (piers) and wall lines indicate additional structures or retaining walls.
Excavation showed that water diverted from Onion Creek to the penstock
was channeled via a wooden fore bay which cut through a large crosswall into the wheel house where it turned a 4 ft diameter metal and wood horizontal turbine. The possibility of another turbine being present in the wheel
house needs further attention. Spent water exited south back to Onion
Creek by way of a tunnel (tailrace) beneath the mill.
Results of Parks and Wildlife excavation and mill artifact descriptions are
incorporated into the main body text.
Recommendations
It was intended originally to recommend that the wheel pit and tailrace
tunnel be completely excavated and an interpretive trail be placed through
the ruins. The flood on November 18, 1974 proved that maintenance could
be a costly and on-going expense to the department. Furthermore, when
elevations were taken, it became apparent that the water table is above the
bottom of the wheel pit and exit tailrace. Rechannelization of Onion Creek
would be necessary to keep the wheel pit from ponding. Recommendations
are for backfilling the wheel pit to an elevation of 146 m (to preserve the turbine, wood, and odd metal artifacts still in the ground but now exposed to
the elements), with clean sand or sandy-loam and further investigation be
left to a future date when expertise and funding are more readily available.
