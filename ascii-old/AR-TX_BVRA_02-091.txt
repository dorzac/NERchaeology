ABSTRACT
An archaeological investigation of a 3200 foot right-of-way for a six inch gas
pipeline in west-central Washington County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas in June 2001. One prehistoric site
(41WT68) was found in the project area. This site is described in this report as a upland
limited activity or camp site area as evidenced by a sparse scatter of ten flakes between
10 and 50 cm below the existing ground surface. That portion of the site within the
right-of-way is not significant, and it is recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed as planned. The site is on private land, and the artifacts were returned to the
landowner.

INTRODUCTION
Duke Energy Field Services, Inc. of Houston, Texas proposes to install a six inch
gas pipeline along a 3200 foot right-of-way in west-central Washington County, Texas
(Figure 1). The pipeline right-of-way will traverse overland from the Means Number 3
Well site to an existing gas pipeline. At the request of Stephen M. Swetish of CSC
Engineering in Bryan, Texas on behalf of Duke Energy Field Services, Inc. BVRA was
retained to evaluate the archaeological potential of the area that will be affected by the
route of the pipeline as currently proposed. As a result of this agreement, an
archaeological survey was conducted on June 29, 2001 by BVRA. The project number
assigned by BVRA is 01-10.
The maximum width of the pipeline route will be 50 feet; however, the actual
ground disturbance or permanent easement will only affect 15 feet; the remaining 35
feet is a temporary work area. The projected depth along the pipeline route is three
feet. The total amount of land involved is 3.67 acres. The current project area is
depicted on the 7.5' United States Geological Survey topographical map Carmine,
Texas (Figure 2) that also serves as the project area map for this report.
The pipeline access is situated on relatively flat to rolling terrain that ranges from
small areas of open pasture to large areas of heavily wooded property along Alum
Creek. The pipeline access initiates at the Means Number 3 Well location and follows
open pastureland in a southeasterly direction for approximately 300 feet before entering
a densely wood tract of land. The line then continues to the southeast across the
densely wooded pasture until it approaches Coyote Run Road (a county maintained
road). At this point, it will change from the standard "trench and bury" to a "directional
boring" under the road. Once boring beneath the road is complete, it will continue in the
same direction until reaching a property boundary and fence approximately 200 feet
north of Alum Creek. The line will then turn 90 degrees to the northeast for about 350
feet before resuming its original southeasterly direction. Then, it traverses about 200
feet at which point it crosses and parallels Alum Creek. Here, standard excavation
methods will be abandoned, and the pipeline access will bore beneath the creek and
existing vegetation. The pipeline will then proceed across predominately open
pastureland for about 900 feet to the existing Duke Energy Pipeline tie-in location.
Along the route of the proposed pipeline both wooded and open grassland areas
are crossed. Surface soils in the project area are mainly fine sandy loams of the
Padina, Falba, and Burlwash series. These soils range in depth from relatively shallow
to moderately well drained fine sandy loams over dense clays that are somewhat poorly
drained. These soils occur on slightly sloping hills to relatively flat terraces and upland
areas. Detailed descriptions of these soils can be found in the soil survey for
Washington County (Chervenka et al. 1981).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical Commission
(Biesaart et al. 1985:76), Washington County is located in the Southeast Texas culturalgeographical region. In terms of recorded archaeological sites, Washington County in
1985 was 20th in a region comprised of 22 counties. In 1985, for example, the county
had 16 known sites or .98% of the region and .08% of the state (Biesaart et al.
1985:88). Currently Washington County has 67 recorded sites (TARL site files).
In 1985, 0 sites in the county had been excavated, one had been tested by hand,
and 13 had been surface collected. Six recorded prehistoric sites in the county were
listed as Archaic, and eight sites were listed as Late Prehistoric. One site contained
burials (Biesaart et al. 1985:195). Unfortunately, the site number is not given by
Biesaart et al. (1985), and the age of this site is not known.
The first major investigation by a professional archaeologist occurred in 1961
during a survey of land to be affected by the proposed Somerville Reservoir in Burleson,
Lee, and Washington counties (Honea 1961). This study resulted in the recording of
the first four archaeological sites in the county (41WT1 - 41WT4). Not one of the four
sites was considered to be potentially significant, and no further work was
recommended.
A review of the Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology series and Archeological
Bibliography for the Southeastern Region of Texas (Moore 1989) published by the
Texas Historical Commission revealed subsequent work has been scattered throughout
the county and consists mainly of projects generated by oil and gas exploration
(Hannum 1991; Turpin 1992), transmission lines (Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc.
1986; Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. 1989; Rogers 1990), Texas Highway
Department projects (Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
1989), water supply projects (Corbin 1986), and recreational facilities (Moore 1998).
The Washington County area is one of the oldest settled areas in Texas with the
town of Washington-on-the Brazos established in 1830. One of the original Texas
counties, Washington County was created in 1836 (Webb 1952:866). The historical
significance of the town of Washington-on-the Brazos and early settlement in the area is
reflected in several professional archaeological investigations conducted at the site and
the Anson Jones Plantation (Carlson 1995; Kuehn 1996).
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Washington County, especially when numerous contract reports are
available. The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al.
1985), other reports cited above, and the Archeological Bibliography for the
Southeastern Region of Texas for more detailed information regarding the archaeology
of Washington County.

METHODS
Prior to visiting the project area, the Principal Investigator conducted an in-house
literature review of relevant contract reports for Washington County. The field survey
crew relied on the 7.5' topographic map Carmine and the soil survey for Washington
County (Chervenka et al. 1981) for location and soils data. Because of the poor surface
visibility, the method utilized to assess the project area consisted of shovel tests dug in
arbitrary 10 cm levels. The pipeline traverses overland in an southeast-northwest
direction through pasture and a thick woods (see Introduction above). The nearest
water source is an unnamed tributary of Alum Creek at the northwest end of the project
area, and the main channel of Alum Creek is located near the existing gas pipeline at
the southeast end of the project area.
After reviewing the topographic map and soils data for the area, it was
hypothesized that the hill overlooking a tributary of Alum Creek was the area most likely
to contain evidence of prehistoric occupation. This hill is located in the uplands with an
elevation of 386 feet at the top. The northern section of the pipeline right-of-way
traverses a steep slope to the Means #3 well which was already in operation. No tests
were dug on this slope or at the well site. Similarly, the southern edge of the hill
crosses another steep slope and then traverses flat terrain with little relief. At the
southern end, the project area crosses the lower reaches of an unnamed tributary of
Alum Creek. This area was considered very low probability. Duke Energy plans to bore
beneath this stream. At the southern end of the project area, there was some
disturbance associated with the existing gas pipeline. The 15 shovel tests were,
therefore, excavated on top of the prominent landform overlooking the creek to the
north. This was viewed by the survey crew as the only likely area for a prehistoric site.
The field survey crew walked the right-of-way from the county road to the top of
the hill where shovel testing was initiated. Since the project area does not exceed 50
feet (15.2 meters) in width, survey transects were not necessary. The first two tests
were dug at the top of the hill in a fine sandy loam with negative results. Shovel Test 3
was placed at the edge of the hill at the point where the slope becomes pronounced. At
this location, two chert flakes were found in levels 3 and 4 (20-40 cm). Since Shovel
Test 3 was at the edge of the slope, the next tests were dug to the southeast at
approximate 10 foot intervals. Artifacts were found in this direction at six of the next
seven tests between 20 and 40 cm. Shovel testing continued in this direction
until two negative tests were dug. At this point, we had reached the opposite slope of
the hill. Therefore, no additional tests were dug along this line. We then returned to the
discovery test (Shovel Test 3) and moved over 10 feet and excavated a line of tests
parallel with the first group. Although these tests were on a rather obvious slope, flakes
were found in two tests. Because of the slope, we did not dig more tests in this
direction. In all, 15 tests excavated, and they were restricted to the high probability area
overlooking the creek to the northwest.

All earth excavated through shovel testing was screened using 1/4" hardware
cloth, and a shovel test log (Appendix I) was kept. Profiles of the shovel tests were
sketched in the field and the tests were drawn on a project area map. The location of all
shovel tests is depicted in Figure 3. The presence of numerous trees and roots in the
project area made it difficult to dig shovel tests at regular intervals. Shovel test intervals
in the site area varied from 10 to 15 feet.
Artifacts collected during shovel testing were bagged and entered on a log.
These specimens were examined in a laboratory setting by William A. Dickens, and his
findings appear as Appendix II to this report.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL revealed no previously recorded archaeological site
in the project area. One prehistoric site (41WT68) was found within the current project
area right-of-way. This site is located on an upland sandy hill with an elevation of 386
feet overlooking an unnamed tributary of Alum Creek approximately 1020 feet to the
northwest. The size of this site is unknown; however, artifacts within the right-of-way
were found in an area approximately 50 x 90 feet in size. In all, 10 flakes were
recovered from depths ranging from 10 to 50 cm below the existing ground surface, and
50% of the artifacts were concentrated between 20-40 cm. The lithic analysis indicated
that 41WT68 probably served as a short-term occupation site in which minor late stage
tool manufacturing and/or tool maintenance activities were conducted. The sparseness
of artifacts is evidenced by the fact that the 10 flakes were found in 8 separate shovel
tests.
This site is located in Padina loamy fine sand, 1-5 percent slopes (53), a deep,
gently sloping soil found on uplands. Typically the surface layer is a yellowish-brown,
neutral loamy fine sand about 25 inches thick. From 25 to 60 inches it is light yellowishbrown, slightly acid loamy fine sand. The subsoil from 60 to 80 inches is a mottled
reddish-yellow and white, medium acid sandy clay loam. This soil is moderately well
drained, runoff is slow, and permeability is moderately slow. Available water capacity is
low (Chervenka 1981:28).
Site 41WT68 is similar to other upland sites in the region containing sparse
amounts of cultural materials in a deep sandy mantle. Since no features or diagnostic
artifacts were found, the research potential of this site is low within the project area.
The site outside of the project area has not been assessed. The portion of the site
within the project area is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.
Therefore no further work is recommended. The site probably extends across the fence
to the southwest out of the project area and may follow the crest of the hill. Therefore, it
is believed that this investigation only sampled a portion of the site. If it does extend to
the southwest as suggested above, significant deposits may be present in other areas.

RECOMMENDATIONS
BVRA recommends that Duke Energy Field Services, Inc. be allowed to proceed
with construction of the pipeline as planned. It is the opinion of BVRA that the portion of
site 41WT68 within the right-of-way is not significant. Should, however, cultural
materials be exposed during the construction of the pipeline in areas other than
mentioned above, all work should cease until the situation can be evaluated by the
Texas Historical Commission in consultation with Duke Energy Field Services, Inc. and
Brazos Valley Research Associates. It is also recommended that additional survey be
conducted if the pipeline right-of-way is moved across the fence to the southwest.

APPENDIX II: LITHIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
Ten flakes were recovered from eight positive shovel tests. These flakes
were analyzed to help determine the cultural significance of the site. The
analysis of flake debitage is an invaluable tool in determining a number of
activities and strategies that were conducted at a particular site. To accomplish
this, a number of attributes were coded and recorded for a statistical evaluation.
This process began with the size grading of each flake. It has been determined
that reductive processes and stages of reduction for bifacial tool manufacture can
be defined through the maximum size of a flake (Ahler 1989; Stahle and Dunn
1982:86). Each flake was passed through a series of eight nested screens. The
screen sizes are: (1) 50 mm or 2 in., (2) 37.5 mm or 1 1/2 in., (3) 25 mm or 3/8
in., (4) 19 mm or 3/4 in., (5) 12.5 mm or 1/2 in., (6) 9.5 mm or 3/8 in., (7) 6.3 mm
or 1/4 in., and (8) < 6.3 mm.
Additional debitage variables coded for included material type, presence
or absence of cortex, heat treatment, striking platform preparation and type, type
of bulb of percussion, and flake termination. The type of raw material is useful in
determining the method and range of material procurement, preparation,
reduction, and ultimate artifact morphology (Dockall 1991; Shafer 1971).
The presence and amount of cortex helps determine the type and degree
of reduction applied to a core or flake. For example, most of the raw materials
found in the project area are chert cobbles that are naturally covered with a hard
"rindâ called cortex that is unsuitable for tool use. Thus, as the cobble is reduced
during tool manufacture, this cortex is proportionately reduced until finally
removed. Three cortex categories have been established: (1) primary
decortication flakes, or those whose dorsal surface is 90-100% covered with
cortex, (2) secondary decortication flakes, or those that are partially covered with
varying amounts of cortex, and (3) tertiary decortication flakes which are those
having no cortex.
The Identification of heat alteration can help determine whether intentional
annealing has occurred or if heating was caused by some other factor. The
platform is the flat surface on top of the edge of a flake where the blow removing
the flake was received (Whittaker 1994:14). These are either natural (cortex
covered) or prepared, and the degree of preparation is a variable controlled by
the knapper (Whittaker 1994:91). Thus, the recognition of platform types can
help further determine reduction strategies.

The type of bulb of percussion (a swelling located immediately below the
platform) is usually an indicator of whether a hard hammer (stone) precursor or a
soft hammer (bone or wood) precursor was used. Very prominent bulbs usually
indicate hard hammer use, and more flattened or diffuse bulbs usually indicate
soft hammer use (Whittaker 1994:185). In addition, the presence of a lipped
edge on the platform is also a general indicator for soft hammer use.
Finally, successful tool manufacture is dependant upon each successive
flake removal. When a flake is removed from a core or biface, a "scar," the
approximate size of the flake, is left on the core or biface's surface, and the type
of termination of the scar can determine whether additional flakes can be
successfully removed with the desired results. The most desirable termination
type is known as "feathered." Flakes exhibiting feather terminations contain
distal and lateral edges that are thin and sharp. This termination type allows
additional flakes to be removed with few problems. However, "stack" or "hinge"
terminations may prevent additional flake removal by failing to detach evenly or
smoothly. Such terminations usually result in a buildup of material and/or diving
into the surface forming "valleys," both of which could result in unsuccessful
reduction and failed tool manufacture.
Results of Debitage Analysis
Washington County lies within a region that contains varying amounts of
chert gravel deposits. These gravels, classified as Colorado River gravels, occur
throughout the Colorado River drainage from east of Austin to the Columbus
area in Fayette County and north to the Yegua Creek region north of Lake
Somerville. These gravels are distinct from other gravels, such as the Brazos
River gravels, by having a more rounded and less angular shape, a thicker and
more pitted cortex, a high variety of colors and textures with an increase in more
translucent forms. These gravels are highly variable in color and texture that, in
many cases, are tough and grainy resulting in a more resistant "nature" to flaking
(Dickens 1995:179-180). There are, however, some extremely knapable forms,
such as "root beer" and the above-mentioned translucent forms. These gravels
are often very abundant, being found in large areas on varying surfaces, while at
other times are restricted to drainage systems. Varying degrees of quartzite and
silicified wood occur within these gravels.
All of the flakes found at this site were derived from these Colorado River
gravels. These flakes are virtually distinct from each other in color and texture,
indicating that multiple cobbles were utilized. Forty percent are yellow and
yellow-brown forms of translucent or semi-translucent chert with the rest
consisting of dark yellow-brown, light yellow-brown, dark gray, and gray-brown
forms of opaque chert.

Two flakes are complete, 5 are proximal fragments, 2 are medial
fragments, and 1 is a distal fragment. Flakes containing platforms, i.e., one
complete and four of the proximal fragments, consist of a single natural platform
and four plain platforms. This indicates that little preparation, beyond cortex
removal and platform angles, was performed. Four flakes contain bulbs, 3 are
diffuse, and 1 is moderately strong. This indicates that a soft hammer (antler,
bone, or wood) was probably used as the precursor.
The flake sizes ranged between grades 5 and 8 (Table 1). From the table
it can be seen that 70% were in the smaller grades (i.e., less than 9.5 mm or 3/8
inch). This suggests that reduction or tool manufacture was being restricted to
late stage reduction or small tool production and/or maintenance. This is further
supported by the absence of primary or secondary cortical flakes. Only one flake
contained cortex, and it was on the platform. This cortex is thin and hard
presenting no problems with flake removal and is often retained on the edges of
blanks until the final thinning processes. This cortex retention was an effort to
conserve as much of the blank width as possible (Dickens 1995:200). Three of
the flakes are thin with feather terminations that are typical in late stage
reductions. Only three flakes showed evidence of burning, and this was probably
the result of post-depositional surface fires.

Interestingly, three of the flakes recovered are either triangular (n=2) or
trapezoidal (n=1) in cross-section. These shapes often suggest possible blade
manufacture. The two triangular specimens are small fragments, but the
trapezoidal specimen, also a medial flake, is fairly wide with a central concave
scar dominating the central portion of the flake. With 30% of the recovered
flakes containing this morphology, it is possible that they represent a form
specialized tool manufacture such as blades or blade-flakes. However, small
cobble reduction, typical of most gravels, is often performed by extensive
longitudinal or end thinning flake removals which follows hand-in-hand with the
cortical edge retention mentioned above and similar blade or blade-like flakes
would have been produced. Therefore, these flake forms may only be a result of
this kind of reduction strategy. The flakes were recovered in an almost even
distribution between levels 2 (10-20 cm) and 5 (40-50 cm) with the majority
between levels 3 and 4.
Conclusions
The results of the analysis indicate that the site was likely utilized as a
short term occupation site in which minor late stage tool manufacturing and/or
tool maintenance activities were conducted. As mentioned above, some
specialized tool manufacture, such as blade or blade-flake manufacture were
preformed, but it is just as likely that these flakes represent other reduction
strategies common to gravels. In addition, no diagnostic artifacts or other
evidence was recovered or identified to establish a chronological placement of
this assemblage. The placement of the majority of the flakes at 30-40 cm
suggests that the assemblage is concentrated within those depths, but
bioturbation activities could have affected the movement of flakes up or down in
the sandy soil.
