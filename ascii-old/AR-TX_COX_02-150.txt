Intensive Archeological Survey of FM 1488 from Existing FM 1488 West of Magnolia to Proposed SH 249
Montgomery County, Texas

ABSTRACT
The Houston District of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) proposes to construct a
new roadway on primarily undeveloped land around the north side of the City of Magnolia in
Montgomery County, Texas. The proposed roadway will be the Farm-to-Market (FM) 1488
Magnolia Relief Route extending from the existing FM 1488 west of Magnolia to the proposed
State Highway (SH) 249 east of Magnolia. The proposed project would be approximately 5.4
miles (8.7 kilometers) in length. The proposed roadway will consist of four lanes, two in each
direction, separated by a median. This project will also include grade-separated overpasses at FM
1774, at the Union Pacific Railroad, and at the proposed SH 249 extension. The project and
archeological area of potential effects totals 199.88 acres, 155.0 of which are new right-of-way,
41.5 acres that overlap with the proposed SH 249 project, and 3.38 acres of existing right-ofÂ­
way.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) applies to this project; the Antiquities
Code of Texas also applies.
Based on a review of the Houston Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), 73 percent of the
199.88-acre (80.8-hectare) project area (146.91 acres or 59.45 hectares) is designated as Map
Unit 2, for which a surface survey is recommended. The total acreage includes right-of-way that
overlaps with the proposed SH 249 project. PALM data also indicated that the remaining area, 27
percent (52.97 acres or 21.43 hectares), is located within Map Unit 4, for which surface survey is
not recommended.
Cox|McLain Environmental Consulting, Inc. (CMEC) completed an intensive archeological survey to
inventory and evaluate archeological resources within the area of potential effects (APE). Fieldwork
was conducted April 11-13, 2017, under Texas Antiquities Permit 7914. Only 48 percent of the
total acreage was surveyed since access was not granted for the remaining 52 percent. The majority
of accessible parcels where intensive survey was conducted was determined to have been heavily
disturbed by activities associated with agriculture and cattle grazing, as well as erosion.
No new archeological sites were identified during the survey and no artifacts were identified or
recovered. Project records will be curated at the Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State
University per TAC 26.16 and 26.17.
The Texas Historical Commission concurred with the findings and recommendations of this report on
September 1, 2017.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Houston District of Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) proposes to construct the Farmto-Market Road 1488 Magnolia Relief Route around the north side of the City of Magnolia in
Montgomery County, Texas. The proposed project would consist of four lanes, two in each direction,
separated by a median. This project would include grade-separated overpasses at FM 1774, at
the Union Pacific Railroad, and at the proposed State Highway (SH) 249 extension. This project
would be on new location with limits extending from FM 1488 west of Magnolia to the proposed
SH 249 east of Magnolia.
The project is sponsored and funded by the TxDOT Houston District. Because TxDOT receives
federal funding, the project is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) as well as the Antiquities Code of Texas. TxDOT contracted with Klotz Associates, Inc. to
carry out environmental studies in support of the project. Klotz contracted with Cox|McLain
Environmental Consulting, Inc. (CMEC) to conduct the cultural resource studies required for
compliance with the NHPA.
The project area of potential effects (APE) is approximately 5.4 miles or 8.7 kilometers in length
and has a typical width between 200 and 350 feet or 61 and 106 meters. The APE will be up to
900 feet (274 meters) wide at the intersection north of FM 1774. The APE is 199.88 acres, 155 of
which are new right-of-way, 41.5 acres that overlap with the proposed SH 249 project, and 3.38
acres of existing right of way. Typical roadway construction depths would reach 2 feet (0.6 meter),
drainage ditches would reach between 1 and 5 feet (0.3 to 1.5 meters) in depth, and the extents
of deeper bridge support column location depths will be determined later.
On April 11-13, 2017, CMEC archeologists conducted an intensive survey in order to inventory and
evaluate archeological resources within the APE. The fieldwork was carried out under Texas
Antiquities Permit 7914 by Brett Lang and Joseph Motley of CMEC. Melissa M. Green served as
Principal Investigator on the project.
Access was restricted to the western portion of the APE; no access was granted to the entire eastern
half of the APE. Where access was allowed, the APE was subjected to an intensive pedestrian
survey; additionally, shovel tests were excavated in areas identified as Potential Liability
Archeological Map (PALM) Map Unit 2. Ground surfaces within the APE were of varying visibilities
(10 to 90 percent) due to cattle and horse grazing practices, housing and commercial development,
and a sand mining operation facility. Other portions of the APE cross areas that have been disturbed
by pipeline corridors. The eastern end of the APE is mostly characterized by a thickly wooded
setting and includes large areas where no access was granted for survey.
A review of the Houston PALM reveals that the majority of the APE (146.91 acres or 59.45 hectares)
falls within Map Unit 2. Within this unit, surface survey was recommended only with moderate deep
potential. The other PALM Map Unit present in the APE was Map Unit 4, covering 52.97 acres
(21.43 hectares). No survey was recommended for Map Unit 4 due to the low chance of prehistoric
archeological deposits.

In all, 39 shovel tests were excavated within the APE. A majority of the shovel tests revealed sandy
loam or sand deposits to a depth of 25 to 60 centimeters below surface (cmbs) underlain with clay
or sandy clay. Nine of the shovel tests extended to 80 to 100 cmbs in sandy loam or sand deposits
and did not encounter clay. Shovel tests were only excavated in areas where previous agricultural
impacts were not apparent, ground visibility was less than 30 percent, and the PALM map units
suggested the likely presence of intact soils that could contain prehistoric archeological deposits.
No new archeological sites were identified and no artifacts were collected; therefore, only project
records will need to be curated per TAC 26.16 and 26.17. Project records will be permanently
housed at the Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State University.

INTRODUCTION

Overview of the Project
The Houston District of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has proposed the
construction of a new-location 5.4-mile (mi), or 8.7-kilometer (km) relief route around the north side
of the city of Magnolia, Montgomery County, Texas.
The proposed Farm-to-Market (FM) 1488 Relief Route would consist of four lanes, two in each
direction, separated by a median. This project would include grade-separated overpasses at FM
1774, at the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR), and at the proposed State Highway (SH) 249 extension.
This project would be on new location. The project limits would be from the existing FM 1488 west
of Magnolia to the proposed SH 249 east of Magnolia. The project and archeological area of
potential effects (APE) totals 199.88 acres, 155.0 of which are new right-of-way, 41.5 acres that
overlap with the proposed SH 249 project, and 3.38 acres of existing right of way. Typical
roadway construction depths would reach 2 feet (ft) or 0.6 meter (m), drainage ditches would reach
depths between 1 and 5 ft (0.3 and 1.5 m). The subsurface extents of the deeper bridge support
column will be determined later.
Brett Lang and Joseph Motley of Cox|McLain Environmental Consulting, Inc. (CMEC) performed the
fieldwork on April 11-13, 2017. Melissa M. Green served as Principal Investigator. Placement of
shovel test units within the APE was based on observed disturbance levels, ground surface visibility,
the professional judgment of the archeologists in the field, the analysis of Houston Potential
Archeological Liability Map (PALM) data, and guidelines established by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) and approved by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).

Regulatory Context
The APE is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (9 TNRC 191). The project also has a federal
nexus due to federal funding, triggering Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA), as amended (16 USC 470; 36 CFR 800). Antiquities Permit 7914 was assigned to this
project by the THC.

Structure of the Report
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 presents environmental parameters, a brief cultural context,
and a summary of previous archeological research near the APE. Chapter 3 discusses research
goals, relevant methods, and the underlying regulatory considerations. Chapter 4 presents the
results of the survey and summarizes the implications of the investigations, and references are in
Chapter 5.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXTS

Topography, Geology, and Soils
The APE is located at approximate elevations of between 220 and 280 ft (67 and 85 m) above
sea level in eastern Montgomery County, Texas (see Figures 1 and 2). The area is surrounded by
a mix of developed and undeveloped areas. The APE crosses numerous tributaries to Mill Creek at
the northern and eastern ends of the alignment and two branches of Mink Branch Creek at the
western end. Geologically, the APE is primarily underlain by the Pleistocene-age Wills Formation
with some occurrences of the Pleistocene-age Beaumont Fluviatile terrace deposits along Mill Creek
(USGS 2017). Wills Formation is primarily clay with some limestone; the Beaumont Formation is
primarily sand with occurrences of gravels.
According to Natural Resources Conservation Service, or NRCS, data (2017), the mapped soils in
the APE include:
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢

Conroe gravelly loamy fine sand on 0 to 5 percent slopes
Conroe loamy fine sand on 0 to 5 percent slopes
Fetzer loamy fine sand on 1 to 5 percent slopes
Katy fine sandy loam on 0 to 1 percent slopes
Edna-Katy complex, Betis fine sand on 0 to 5 percent slopes
Splendora fine sandy loam on 0 to 2 percent slopes
Frequently flooded Bibb soils
Lilbert loamy fine sand

Most of these soils are deep to very deep and occur in upland settings. With the exception of the
Bibb soils, which are also deep but are located on floodplains, all of these soils have shallow A
horizons [0 to 10 centimeters (cm) deep], often with E horizons below that extend to approximately
60 cm deep. The E horizon is over a Bt Horizon.

Vegetation, Physiography, and Land Use
The APE is located in the Southern Tertiary Uplands within the South-Central Plains ecoregion,
according to the Griffith, et al. Ecoregion Map (2007) derived from Gould et al. (1960). According
to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Departmentâs Vegetation Types of Texas map and accompanying
descriptions, the APE is in an area mapped as being covered with Pine-Hardwood Forest (McMahan
et al. 1984). Vegetation noted during the survey included manicured grazing lands, various types
of native and invasive grasses, blackberry bushes, and thorny vines, as well as oak and other
hardwood trees. In the eastern portion of the APE, dense woods replace slightly undulating pasture
land. Many of the surrounding parcels are primarily used for cattle or horse grazing.

Archeological Chronology for Southeast Texas
The APE lies within the Southeast Texas archeological region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993;
Patterson 1995; Perttula 2004; Story et al. 1990), which has a cultural history extending back at

least 12,000 years into the past. Human occupation of the area during these 12,000 years is
divided into four broad periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. The periods
are based on a proposed sequence of economic strategies identified in the archeological and
historical records. These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways consider cultural, economic, and
technological factors in order to provide a model useful for attempting to understand ancient and
early historic populations. The dates assigned to the period interfaces represent a generalized time
range but are based on scientific results from archeological research. The dates presented in Table
1 are derived from Perttula (2004).
Further discussion of the prehistory of Southeast Texas is beyond the scope of this document. For
such a discussion regarding the prehistoric record, the reader is referred to Aten (1983), Ensor
(1991), Patterson (1995), and Story et al. (1990), among others.

Historic Context
The earliest known European exploration of the region dates to the early seventeenth century with
RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1687. Spanish soldiers followed in order to reclaim the
land from the French. The Spanish continued to expand their occupation in Montgomery County,
eventually establishing three missions along Spring Creek. By 1756 no permanent Spanish
settlements existed and the missions were abandoned (Long 2016).
Anglo-American settlement began in the early 1820s when Stephen F. Austin proposed his local
settlement. Originally 42 families of Austinâs Colony acquired land titles from the Mexican
government, settling in western Montgomery County. One of the earliest settlers was Andrew
Montgomery who set up a trading post at the Loma del Toro and lower Coushatta traces crossroads.
The population increased greatly in the 1830s and in December of 1837 the Republic of Texas

Montgomery County, Texas

Congress established Montgomery County. The modern boundaries of the county were in place
after 1870 when Waller County was established (Long 2016).

Previous Investigations and Previously Identified Resources
A review of the Houston PALM revealed that the majority of the APE [146.91 ac (59.45 ha) or 73
percent] falls within Map Unit 2. For the portions of the APE that fall within this unit, a surface survey
is recommended (Figures 3a-d; Abbott 2001). The remaining APE falls within Map Unit 4 [52.97
acres (21.43 ha) or 27 percent], an area for which no survey is recommended.
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) maintained by the THC and the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory was conducted in order to identify archeological sites, historical
markers (Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks), properties or districts listed on the National Register
of Historic Places, State Antiquities Landmarks, cemeteries, or other cultural resources that may have
been previously recorded in or near the APE, as well as previous surveys undertaken in the area. A
larger 1-km study area around the APE was also examined (Figure 2).
According to the Atlas search, the majority of the APE has not been previously surveyed, although
two linear surveys cross the alignment (THC 2017). One linear survey was performed in 2015 for
TxDOT by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) for the proposed SH 249 roadway to which this project
will ultimately connect (Fields and Burden 2015; THC 2017). The other was performed in 2005 for
TxDOT by Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. for widening FM 1774 (THC 2017).
There are no recorded archeological sites within the APE or within the 1-kilometer buffer area
surrounding the APE. There are three cemeteries within the buffer area surrounding the APE: Old
Sanders Cemetery, âunknownâ Magnolia (or Turner-Thomas Cemetery), and âunknownâ Missionary
Church (Unknown Cemetery No. 5). There is little information about Old Sanders Cemetery (MQÂ­
C036), Turner-Thomas Cemetery (MQ-C034), or Unknown Cemetery No. 5 (MQ-C031) on the Atlas
(THC 2017). According to findagrave.com (Tipton 2017), the Old Sanders Cemetery has only one
burial, which dates to 1992, and the Turner-Thomas Cemetery has 12 burials dating from the late
nineteenth century to the 1940s. No information on the Missionary Church (Unknown Cemetery No.
5) was available on findagrave.com.
A review of available historic aerial photos and topographic maps on Google Earthâ¢ and the
Nationwide Environmental Title Research (NETR) website, www.historicaerials.com, was also
undertaken to determine how the corridor has been utilized over time. According to the earliest
aerial photo (1957) and topographic map (1964) available, most of the development, outside of
Magnolia, was between existing FM 1488 and FM 1774 (NETR 2017). The vegetation depicted on
the 1957 aerial makes it difficult to identify the types of structures present, but many are likely
residences. The remaining portion of the APE is still undeveloped, primarily between FM 1486 and
the planned SH 249 corridor, as much of the development is along the existing FM 1488 roadway.

RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

Purpose of the Research
The present study was carried out to accomplish three major goals:
1. to identify all historic and prehistoric archeological resources located within the APE defined
in Chapter One;
2. to perform a preliminary evaluation of the identified resourcesâ potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and/or for designation as a SAL (typically performed concurrently); and
3. to make recommendations about the need for further research concerning the identified
resources based on the preliminary NRHP/SAL evaluation, with guidance on methodology
and ethics from the THC and CTA.

Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended (16 USC 470; 36 CFR 800), directs federal
agencies and entities using federal funds to âtake into account the effects of their undertakings on
historic propertiesâ (36 CFR 800.1a). The CFR defines âhistoric propertyâ as âany prehistoric or
historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National
Register of Historic Places [NRHP] maintained by the Secretary of the Interiorâ (36 CFR 800.16).
In order to determine the presence of historic properties (with this phrase understood in its broad
Section 106 sense), an APE is first delineated. The APE is the area in which direct impacts (and in a
federal context, indirect impacts as well) to historic properties may occur. Within the APE, resources
are evaluated to determine whether they are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and to determine
the presence of any properties that are already listed on the NRHP. To determine whether a
property is significant, cultural resource professionals and regulators evaluate the resource using
these criteria:
. . . The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering,
and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity
of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
a. that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
b. that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c. that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction,
or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
d. that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history
(36 CFR 60.4).

Montgomery County, Texas

Note that significance and NRHP eligibility are determined by two primary components: integrity
and at least one of the four types of association and data potential listed under 36 CFR 60.4(a-d).
The criterion most often applied to archeological sites is the lastâand arguably the broadestâof
the four; its phrasing allows regulators to consider a broad range of research questions and
analytical techniques that may be relevant to the specific resource (36 CFR 60.4[d]).
Occasionally, certain resources fall into categories which require further evaluation using one or
more of the following Criteria Considerations. If a resource is identified and falls into one of these
categories, the Criteria Considerations listed below may be applied in conjunction with one or more
of the four National Register criteria listed above:
a. A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or
historical importance; or
b. A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily
for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a
historic person or event; or
c. A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no other
appropriate site or building directly associated with his or her productive life.
d. A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent
importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic
events; or
e. A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented
in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or
structure with the same association has survived; or
f. A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value
has invested it with its own historical significance; or
g. A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance
(36 CFR 60.4).
Resources listed in the NRHP and resources recommended eligible for the NRHP are treated the
same under Section 106; they are generally treated the same at the state level as well.
After cultural resources within the APE are identified and evaluated, effects evaluations are
completed to determine whether the proposed project has no effect, no adverse effect, or an
adverse effect on the resources. Effects are evaluated by assessing the impacts that the proposed
project will have on the characteristics that make the property eligible for listing in the NRHP and
on its integrity. Types of potential adverse effects considered include physical impacts, such as the
destruction of all or part of a resource; property acquisitions that adversely impact the historic
setting of a resource, even if built resources are not directly impacted; noise and vibration impacts
evaluated according to accepted professional standards; changes to significant viewsheds; and
cumulative effects that may occur later in time. If the project will have an adverse effect on cultural
resources, measures can be taken to avoid, minimize, or mitigate this adverse effect. In some
instances, changes to the proposed project can be made to avoid adverse effects. In other cases,

adverse effects may be unavoidable, and mitigation to compensate for these impacts will be
proposed and agreed upon by consulting parties.

Antiquities Code of Texas
Because the project is currently owned and funded by TxDOT Houston District, a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, the project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (9 TNRC 191), which
requires consideration of effects on properties designated asâor eligible to be designated asâ
SALs. SALs are defined as:
. . . sites, objects, buildings, structures and historic shipwrecks, and locations of historical,
archeological, educational, or scientific interest including, but not limited to, prehistoric
American Indian or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, aboriginal
paintings, petroglyphs, and other marks or carvings on rock or elsewhere which pertain to
early American Indian or other archeological sites of every character, treasure imbedded
in the earth, sunken or abandoned ships and wrecks of the sea or any part of their contents,
maps, records, documents, books, artifacts, and implements of culture in any way related to
the inhabitants, prehistory, history, government, or culture in, on, or under any of the lands
of the State of Texas, including the tidelands, submerged land, and the bed of the sea
within the jurisdiction of the State of Texas. (13 TAC 26.2)
Rules of practice and procedure for the evaluation of cultural resources as SALs, which is also
explicitly referenced at the state level, are detailed at 13 TAC 26. An archeological site identified
on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas may be of sufficient significance to allow
designation as a SAL if at least one of the following criteria applies:
1. the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. the site's archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
4. the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
5. the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to insure [sic] maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic
collecting when the site cannot be protected (13 TAC 26.10).
For archeological resources, the state-level process requires securing a valid Texas Antiquities
Permit from the THC, the lead state agency for Antiquities Code compliance. This permit must be
maintained throughout all stages of investigation, analysis, and reporting.

Survey Methods and Protocols
CMEC conducted an intensive survey according to the guidelines provided in 13 TAC 26.13-26.18
and using the definitions in 13 TAC 26.3. Field methods and strategies complied with the
requirements of 13 TAC 26.10 and 13 TAC 26.15-26.18, as elaborated by the THC and the CTA.
Shovel test units were focused in areas where ground surface visibility was below 30 percent, soils
appeared deep enough to contain subsurface cultural materials, potential for historic archeological
sites was high based on map data, and/or disturbance appeared minimal. All shovel tests were
excavated in natural levels to subsoil or 60 centimeters (cm) 24 inches [in]), whichever was
encountered first. Excavated matrix was screened through 0.635 or 0.25-in hardware cloth as
allowed by moisture and clay content; in some cases sediments required examination by hand or
trowel. Deposits were described using conventional texture classifications and Munsell color
designations. If any shovel tests had contained cultural materials, radial shovel tests would have
been placed at 10-m (33-ft) intervals around each positive shovel test until two negative units had
been established in each cardinal direction, as allowed by project limits. Mechanical trenching was
not anticipated based on PALM analysis and was not used in this investigation. No parts of the APE
fall within areas flagged for deep testing (see Figures 3a-d).
The APE has a low probability of encountering human burials; if burials are found, TxDOT would
be notified and all requirements of 8 THSC 711 would be followed.
Most of the APE was located on privately owned land anticipated for acquisition; therefore, any
artifacts found from shovel tests and surface contexts would have been noted, described,
photographed, and returned to their original contexts. Since access was not available at the time
of the survey for approximately half of the APE, a reasonable and good-faith effort was made to
document inaccessible areas from accessible areas for the purposes of Permit 7914.
No new sites were observed or recorded during the investigation. Had a site been identified, a
temporary marker would have been placed on the site. The markers would have included an
identifying name employing the last name of the CMEC employee who recorded the site or
corresponding landform. The temporary site nomenclature would be superseded by a formal site
trinomial obtained following the completion of fieldwork. Site designations would have been
applied only to features (whether surface or subsurface) that appeared to represent occupation or
activity areas and/or to clusters of artifacts (whether surface or subsurface) that met the minimum
threshold of two contiguous positive shovel test units.
CMEC personnel kept a complete record of field notes supplemented by digital photographs, with
observations including (but not limited to) identified sites, cultural materials, location markers,
contextual integrity, estimated time periods of occupations, vegetation, topography, hydrology,
land use, soil exposures, general conditions at the time of the survey, and field techniques employed.
All materials (notes, photographs, administrative documents, and other project data) generated
from this work will be curated at the Center for Archeological Studies at Texas State University
where they will be made permanently available to future researchers as per 13 TAC 26.16-17.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

General Field Observations and Results
On April 11-13, 2017, CMEC personnel conducted an intensive archeological survey of sections of
the APE for which access had been granted. Accessible portions of the APE began at the western
end of the APE and extended approximately 3.2 mi (5.1 km) east. Within this western section,
properties for which access was not granted were intermixed with those to which access had been
granted. Thus, CMEC archeologists were able to access a total of approximately 2.6 mi (4.2 km or
about half, of the 5.4-mi (8.7 km) length of the APE. No access was granted for the remaining
segment extending to the eastern terminus.
The intensive survey included both pedestrian survey and shovel testing. More than half (143.6 ac
(58.11 ha) of the APE falls within PALM Map Unit 2 where a surface survey was recommended. For
these sections, a CMEC crew conducted pedestrian survey, photographed the areas, and excavated
shovel tests. The remaining sections of the APE were located within PALM Map Unit 4 where no
survey is recommended. Pedestrian surveys were conducted and photographs were taken of the
segments in Map Unit 4, but these areas were not shovel tested. In all, 39 shovel tests were
excavated in locations mapped in Map Unit 2 and shown in Figures 4a-h. Complete shovel test
descriptions are listed in Appendix A.
The survey began at the western end, north of FM 1488 (see Figure 4a). The APE starts in a sand
mining yard with disturbances from cleared roads and large piles of sand (Figure 5). Other than
the cleared area for the sand piles where ground visibility was 100 percent and a semi-cleared
field with blackberry vines, other unidentified grasses and scattered trees allowed for only 0 to 20
percent ground visibility. Two shovel tests (BL01 and JM02) extended from 55 to 100 cmbs with
sand or loamy sand exposed. Both shovel tests were negative for cultural material on the surface
and subsurface. Continuing north, the APE partially enters one of the properties with no access; only
the western boundary edge could be surveyed along a fence line (Figure 6). The area is less
disturbed along the edge of a wooded area in a cleared section with short prairie grasses and 10
to 50 percent ground visibility. Four shovel tests (BL02, BL03, JM03, and JM04) were excavated
along the fence line before encountering another property with no access for the next 0.27 mi (0.43
km). All four shovel tests were negative for cultural material.
Continuing north, the APE crosses Old Hempstead Road (see Figures 4b-c). After meeting with the
landowner, access was granted onto the APE 0.48 mi (0.77 km) south of Old Hempstead Road. The
terrain is a cleared, mowed field used for cattle grazing with short prairie grasses, scattered oaks,
pines, and other large trees, along with 20 to 50 percent ground visibility (Figure 7). The landowner
stated that the landscape has been used only for cattle grazing for as long as she can remember,
and she has lived there for 80 years (personal communication, Joyce Gilliams, May 11, 2017). No
disturbance has come from agricultural practices or terracing of the land, nor has she found any
cultural material. The ground surface is relatively level with low, rolling hills (Figure 8). The property
is in the PALM Map Unit 4 area; however, one shovel test (JM01) was excavated on the biggest
hilltop to determine the subsurface potential. The shovel test was negative for cultural material and
extended to 55 cmbs before compact loamy sand was encountered.

North of Old Hempstead Road to FM 1774 the setting is manicured yard for an abandoned modern
house. The front yard of the house (Figure 9) has short manicured grass with 10 to 30 percent
ground visibility. The house, located at the northern end of the property (Figure 10), appears to
have been burned based on the interior damage. Behind the house, UPRR tracks immediately south
of FM 1774 were located. The vegetation changed to 0 to 20 percent ground visibility in the
disturbed area with taller chest- to head-high grasses of various types. Ten shovel tests were
excavated in this area. Disturbance was located north of the house with evidence of a gravel layer
from 10 to 30 cmbs. Shovel tests BL08 to BL12 and JM09 to JM13 were excavated with clay
commonly encountered from 30 to 50 cmbs overlain with sandy loam soils. Four of the shovel tests
contained multiple layers of sandy loams to 90 cmbs. Nothing cultural was observed on the surface
or subsurface.
The APE continued to the northeast north of FM 1774 widening out to approximately 738 ft (225
m, see Figure 4c). The entire width of the APE was available for survey at FM 1774 to FM 1486,
except for the corner parcel in the southwest corner of the intersection. The APE in this area began
in a heavy wooded parcel north of FM 1774 (Figure 11) then extended north into a semi-cleared
field up to a farmstead with barns and fences. Ground visibility was 20 to 50 percent in the wooded
section and vegetation included pines, cedars, oaks, and blackberry bushes, along with other
unidentified trees and grasses. In the semi-cleared field ground visibility was 10 to 30 percent on
the hilltop with ankle- to waist-high prairie grasses; oaks and other unidentifiable trees and prairie
grasses were elsewhere (Figure 12). Eight shovel tests were excavated, BL04 to BL07 and JM05 to
JM08, with clay observed at 50 to 60 cmbs only in the area close to FM 1774 and sand or sandy
loam extending to 60+ cmbs in the remaining shovel tests leading up to the hilltop location. No
cultural material was observed in any of the shovel tests or on the surface.
An adjoining parcel contained a manicured horse grazing field with short ankle-high grasses, large
oaks and pines more than 40 ft (12.2 m) tall, and other unidentifiable tree and grass species (Figure
13). Ground visibility ranged from 10 to 40 percent on a relatively level surface. A small stream
located close to the western boundary of the APE measured less than 1.6 ft (0.5 m) deep and wide;
it continued south into the no access property (Figure 14). In all, 10 shovel tests were placed from
FM 1486 to the southern property with no access (BL15 to BL19 and JM16 to JM20). Clay was
commonly encountered at 50 cmbs along the western boundary of the APE. On the eastern
boundary of the APE sand extended to 70 to 90 cmbs. No cultural materials were observed on the
surface or subsurface.
East of FM 1486, land access was limited and restricted to various parcels for approximately 1.12
mi or 1.79 km. At that point, no access was granted all the way to the eastern terminus (see Figures
4e-h). Parcels near and adjacent to the high school included a disturbed cleared area behind the
high school where a large water runoff area (Figure 15) and wooded area extended to FM 1486.
East of the disturbed cleared area a young-growth dense woods setting extended to the next no
access property (Figure 16). This section is in the PALM Map Unit 4 zone for which shovel testing is
not recommended; therefore, the segment was only pedestrian surveyed. No cultural materials were
observed on the surface. Ground visibility ranged from 10 to 30 percent in the cleared/disturbed
section and 0 to 20 percent in the dense woods. Vegetation in the cleared/disturbed area included

only short mowed grass; other areas were characterized by mostly young oaks, pines, cedars, green
briar, and other unidentified trees and grasses.
Access was granted to parcels near S Buckhorn Lane (see Figure 4e). Disturbance had occurred in
the western end of the property where large trees had been cleared, resulting in nearly 100
percent ground visibility in some locations (Figure 17). The section is also developed with housing
north and south of the proposed APE. Another wooded segment with housing intermixed started at
the eastern end of the property (Figure 18) where a trailer home is seen partially in the woods. As
with the previous area, this section fell under the PALM Map Unit 4 for which survey is not
recommended. Therefore, the area was only walkedâno shovel tests were conducted. Nothing
cultural was observed on the surface.
Additional parcels in this area lie in very dense woods accessed from a north/south road connecting
S Buckhorn Lane and S Brenda Lane (see Figure 4e). A small unnamed drainage (Figure 19) within
Map Unit 2 received shovel testing (BL13, BL14, JM14, and JM15), with two shovel tests located on
each bank. All four shovel tests were negative for cultural material. Sand was the prominent soil
type, extending from 40 cmbs to a maximum depth of 80 cmbs. The extremely dense wooded area
was accessed through an existing pipeline corridor east of S Brenda Lane (Figure 20). Vegetation
included pines, oaks, cedar elms, greenbriar, and other unidentified trees and grasses with ground
visibility at 20 to 50 percent. The trees also consisted of both young growth less than 10 feet (3.0
meters) tall and old growth from 30 to 40 ft (9.1 to 12.2 m) tall. The young growth trees were
often close together (Figure 21) making it difficult to walk the property.
The remaining 2.2 mi (3.5 km) were not surveyed due to lack of access. Based on aerial photographs
and field observations, the terrain appears very similar to the previously discussed adjacent
segment in thick, dense woods. At the eastern end of the APE the future SH 249 ROW and this
projectâs APE overlap.

Recommendations
Results of the survey indicated that extensive disturbances have occurred in a majority of the APE
due to previous construction activities, utility installations, commercial and residential development,
sand mining operations, and cattle or horse grazing. No evidence was found of any preserved
cultural deposits in any of the 39 shovel test locations or on the surface with a high degree of
integrity. Additionally, personal communication with one landowner at the least disturbed
environmental setting south of Old Hempstead Road confirmed that no cultural deposits or remains
were ever observed or encountered on their property. Pedestrian survey was conducted on all
parcels where right of entry was granted, whether shovel testing was required or not based on
PALM data, since there were parcels in-between that required shovel testing. These 84.84 acres
(34.3 ha) with right-of entry all occurred in the western half of the APE. No additional archeological
investigations are warranted prior to construction activities for the western half of the APE. However,
areas with no right of entry all fall within the eastern half of the APE and entirely within Map Unit
2 where 111.68 ac (45.2 ha) of surface survey is recommended. The parcels within the APE in the
eastern half starting at S. Buckhorn Lane should be surveyed prior to any construction activities in
this area.

No artifacts were collected; therefore, only project records will be curated per TAC 26.16 and
26.17 at CAS at Texas State University where they will be made permanently available to future
researchers.
If any unanticipated cultural materials or deposits are found at any stage of clearing, preparation,
or construction, the work should cease in that area and TxDOT personnel should be notified
immediately. During evaluation of any unanticipated finds and coordination between TxDOT and
THC, clearing, preparation, and/or construction could continue in any other areas along the corridor
where no such deposits or materials are observed.
