CVAS Annual Picnic
San Angelo State Park
The Concho Valley Archaeological
Society enjoyed a field trip to San Angelo
State Park on a beautiful July Saturday. The group boarded the trailer for a
tour with Ranger Bill Guffey to many areas of the park. For some it was the first
trip to the park, but many have frequented
the park area often as bikers, hunters, hikers, fishermen, birders, or photographers. Of special interest this day were
sites with evidence of habitation by previous cultures and travelers through the
thousands of acres associated with the
North Concho River.
Because of its available water
sources and the game and pecan trees
nearby, the park area was traversed by nomadic groups of hunters and gathers for
thousands of years. There are middens
and mortar holes indicating groups like
the Jumanos lived there for extended periods. Petroglyphs carved into rocks are
dated

CVAS Picnic from page 1
hundreds of years old. Of special interest is
the possible bison jump located near
Brown's Crossing. Macey's grave indicates
that a man died in 1847, probably one of the
first Anglos in the area. The park was a
bivouac site for soldiers from Fort Concho
and later became privately-owned ranchland.
Stops to see the bison, longhorns and
prairie dogs accompanied by facts and anecdotes from Ranger Guffey were enjoyed by
all. CVAS members ended an interesting
and informative tour with a picnic lunch at
the South Pavilion. The group expects to
plan future events at SASP to learn more
about its archeological features and historical presence and in the Concho Valley.

Rock Art Foundation Tour
Meyers Springs Pictograph Panel, September 1, 2007
Last Chance This Year
Meyers Springs, a major source of water in dry west Texas, has been a center for human activity
for thousands of years. At the spring site ancient peoples left Pecos River style rock art. Then
later native artists recorded the European contact with the indigenous peoples atop the older
paintings. Still later the Seminole Scouts and local ranchers left their marks. This site was added
to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and today is privately owned. The Rock Art
Foundation, in stewardship with the landowner, invites you for a tour to this very important rock
art and historic site.
Your guide for this tour will be Greg Williams. The tour will meet in Dryden, Texas, at the intersection of Hwy 90 and Hwy 349. Be there at 9:30am and be prepared for a prompt 10:00am departure. Be sure to bring everything you need for a day in the west Texas sun - water, lunch, and
sunscreen.
The drive to the ranch does not require any special vehicle and all except for the lowest of cars
will do fine. Once there it is a short walk to the rock art panel. This is an excellent tour for
young children. After seeing the rock art the tour will drive a short distant to the outpost of the
Seminole Scouts who patrolled the western Texas frontier in the 1880’s and 90’s. The tour usually concludes by 3:00pm.
The cost of this tour is $35.00 per person. To register for the tour email the RAF at
rockart01@aol.com (preferred) or call 888-762-5278. Please include the number in your group
and a telephone number where we might reach you. The cell service in the Comstock area is not
dependable so you will, most likely, be out of touch. Please no pets.

White Shaman Preserve Open September 1
The White Shaman Preserve will open September 1, 2007, after being closed for the summer.
We hope to see many of you over the Labor Day Holiday and during the beautiful fall season
along the lower Pecos River.
Tours to the White Shaman pictograph panel are at 12:30 pm throughout the season – September
through May. No reservations are needed. Meet the weekend guide at the gate along Hwy 90
just east of the Pecos River Bridge. It is then a short drive into the property and to the parking
area. Be sure to wear sturdy footwear and bring drinking water for the two hour long tour.
