Foreword
K. Perttula

This special volume of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society, the Society's 70th, focuses
on Spanish Colonial archeology and historical
research in Texas. Its original impetus was a
symposium of papers on Spanish Colonial
archeology held at the 1996 Annual Meeting of the
Texas Archeological Society in San Antonio, along
with the interest fostered by the 1997 and 1998
Texas Archeological Society Field Schools held at
Mission Espiritu Santo de Zuniga (41 VTll) in
Victoria County, Texas (Thomas R. Hester,
Principal Investigator).
The 29 papers in the "Spanish Colonial Archeological and Historical Research in Texas" section of this volume range across the breadth and
scope of current Spanish colonial studies in our
state. They deal with the following themes: first
entradas and trails; Native American history during
the Spanish colonial era; Spanish colonial missions,
presidios, and civil settlements (ranchos) in Texas,
including acequias and grist mills; material culture
studies (particularly lithics, Native-made and Spanish-made ceramics, and glass beads), and the use
and exploitation of wild and domesticated animals
by the mission inhabitants.
Through the concerted efforts of many archeologists, historians, and archivists-both professional and avocational-and building on the
many excellent studies completed in the first
three-quarters of the 20th century, our understanding of Spanish Colonial Texas has grown
by leaps and bounds in the last 20 years or more
(see Hester 1989; Simons and Hoyt 1992;
Gilmore 1995; de la Teja 1997, 1998), and there
is every reason to expect this trend to continue
for the foreseeable future. Truly, Spanish Colonial archeology and history is alive and well in
Texas. To foster a broader appreciation among
the public and in our educational system of the
Spanish colonial era in Texas and surrounding

states, I think that the year 2000 would be a propitious and exciting time for the Texas Archeological Society, the Texas State Historical Association,
the Texas Catholic Historical Society, the Texas
Historical Commission, and other organizations
to join together to organize a conference on Spanish Colonial archeology and history in Texas. From
this conference should come publications and
scholarly articles, public exhibits and Websites,
CD-ROMs, and other materials that can convey to
the interested public the rich and diverse archeological and historical heritage (both Native American, Mexican, and European) of the Spanish
colonial era in Texas.
I would like to thank the many volume authors
that contributed to the Spanish Colonial archeological and historical section of the Bulletin. I also
appreciate the help and assistance provided by Linda
W. Ellis, Associate Editor, and several professional
colleagues that served as peer reviewers for the
papers. These include C. Britt Bousman, John W.
Clark, Pam Headrick, Thomas R. Hester, Nancy A.
Kenmotsu, Nancy G. Reese, Steve A. Tomka, and
Mariah F. Wade.

Spanish Colonial Archeology in Texas:
Where We Are and Where Should
We Be Going from Here?
Anne A. Fox

Contrary to the impressions of the general public, Spanish colonial sites in Texas include more
than just Franciscan missions. The Spanish also
built presidios and founded towns. They constructed
houses and parish churches, established ranches out
in the countryside, and built dams and irrigation
systems, sugar mills, grist mills, brick and lime
kilns, and other industrial sites.
Few Spanish colonial mission sites had been
investigated by Texas archeologists before 1962
(Tunnell and Newcomb 1969:iii), with the exception of excavations in the late 1930s under the
direction of the National Park Service in connection with the restoration of Mission Senora del
Espiritu Santo at Goliad (Figure 1). Since no report was written by the archeologists on the project,
no one had the benefit of what was learned there
until a later study was done of the artifacts
(Mounger 1959).
Texas archeologists began working in the 1960s
at known sites with visible ruins-Mission San
Lorenzo at Camp Wood, the San Antonio missions,
and the Alamo-nice, solid sites we could see and
identify. Since most of us had little experience in
historical archeology, we learned by trial and error
how to recognize and understand wall foundations;
what kinds of construction to anticipate; how the
buildings should be arranged; and what sorts of
artifacts we should encounter. Using the techniques
we had learned for excavating prehistoric sites, we
began to examine and record historic structures for
the first time. Fortunately, the fact that we were on
unfamiliar ground encouraged us to proceed cautiously, recording everything in field notes and measured drawings. We gradually learned how to use
the time-honored techniques in new ways, how to
recognize and record structural details, when to
trench and when to open large areas, and most
recently when it was appropriate to use heavy machinery such as a backhoe or Gradall to recover

certain types of information. We learned to do our
research before we went into the field, and to plan
our excavations based on the results, rather than
digging first and then deciding later what we had
found.
After a while, we realized that we had only
examined mission sites, and began to also look for
the presidios and settlements that usually went along
with them. We began to think about how to find
Spanish sites that were no longer visible on the
surface, sites about which we had little information
beyond a few mentions in the documents. Some of
our missions and presidios had been moved at least
once, and some of them had been moved several
times. How could we find these sites?
To answer this need, Kathleen Gilmore proposed a four-pronged method to find these "lost"
sites. In order to properly identify a site, one should
construct a model of the site based on the expected
geographic location, topographic features, the physiographic nature of the area, and the cultural remains that should be present. Armed with such a
model, one could go forth and find the lost sites,
and she proceeded to prove it by locating and identifying the San Xavier mission complex in Central
Texas (Gilmore 1969).
Thinking in this manner and persevering despite obstacles and disappointments, we gradually
learned that all four of these requirements must be
met before we could with assurance say we had
found a particular Spanish site. For instance, at
Mission Espiritu Santo in Mission Valley north of
Victoria, despite the fact that we were sure we had
the right location and some very convincing ruins,
until we finally recovered Spanish artifacts during
testing operations we could not say with certainty
that we had the right site.
Another thing we have learned is that it is hard
to get much information when we are limited to
small, scattered excavation units. We can get a

sample but not much more. Small units can be
helpful, however, if they are carefully placed based
on intensive documentary research beforehand. Jake
Ivey proved this at Mission Concepcion in San
Antonio in 1981 (Ivey and Fox 1999), when he was
able to reconstruct the entire outline of the mission
that had disappeared by the 1890s. However, for
the most part, the best structural information from
Spanish colonial sites that has been recovered has
come from large, horizontal excavations such as
those carried out by Curtis Tunnell at Mission San
Lorenzo (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969), Mardith
Schuetz at Mission San Juan Capistrano in San
Antonio (Schuetz 1968), and Kathleen Gilmore at
Mission Rosario at Goliad (Gilmore 1974).
We have also learned how vitally important it
is to record every minute detail of what we see in

the ground. Such careful recording will pay off,
sometimes when another archeologist works nearby
and can suddenly relate what you found to what he
or she is finding, sometimes years later when we
have learned more about colonial sites and see things
in these previous excavation reports that we did not
understand at the time. Our understanding of Spanish colonial sites, and the way past peoples were
thinking, is of necessity cumulative, with one discovery building upon another.
Nevertheless, everything always seems to go
back eventually to the accuracy of our understanding of the Spanish documents. And this is where
we have usually been dependent upon historians
and translators for our information. This is appropriate, and we need to cooperate and work with
people in other related fields of research. The prob-

Fox lem is that sometimes translators skip over the
little, niggling details that are terribly important to
the archeologist, but not so important to the historian. Also, translators sometimes differ with each
other, which can add to our confusion. For these
reasons, some of us have learned that with determination and a good Spanish dictionary we can
read the documents, at least well enough to know
when we need help. Then we can ask our specialist
friends for translations of small sections, rather
than whole documents.
So we have excavated in known sites, we have
found some missing ones thanks to the "Gilmore
Method," and we have learned our way around in
the Spanish archives and the county courthouse
records. We wish for larger projects where we
could learn more, but are nearly always limited by
time and money. Where should we be going from
here? How can we make the most of what opportunities we have to learn more about Spanish colonial archeology?
We are branching out to examine other aspects of the Spanish colonial period such as dams
and acequias (see Cox, this volume) and civilian
settlements and Indian camps, finding and identifying new sites (see Horell, this volume), and expanding our knowledge of those we already know
about. In addition we are doing in-depth studies of
specific artifact types, learning how to gain more
from the information we recover.
The best and most recent example of the way
we should be looking at our Spanish colonial sites
is the 1997 and 1998 Texas Archeological Society
Field School at the site of Mission Espiritu Santo in
Mission Valley, north of Victoria (Walter and Hester
1998; Walter 1997, Walter, this volume). Careful
advance research and planning resulted in a thorough investigation of a frontier mission, including
every aspect of mission life: not just the buildings
but the people that lived there; the quarry from
which the stone was obtained; the kiln that produced the lime for construction; and the irrigation
system that helped produce the food to sustain the
mission inhabitants (Rinker et al., this volume). We
seldom, if ever, put such a large group of people in
the field doing archeology as was done there, but
the important thing is the comprehensive picture
that has evolved of the mission as an institution.
It seems that the public and professional interest in the archeology of Spanish colonial sites in
Texas has revived and is growing. The question

Spanish Colonial Archeology in Texas

now is, how do we direct that interest and enthusiasm into research that is more than just more shovel
tests and one meter squares producing disjointed
results? We must do more than just continue in the
same way.
It is time to reexamine our earlier reports for
deeper meanings, more details, and for clues to
further research efforts. Comparative studies of architectural practices must be pursued, along with a
better understanding of industries such as brick making, lime burning, sugar making, and pottery making. We need to reach out to other archeologists
and historians in the Southwest who may know
more about these things. Perhaps this means getting together whenever possible; in short, we need
less expensive meetings than the large national society meetings. It means corresponding with our
peers everywhere: did I hear someone say the
Internet? The Spanish were not eager experimenters. They were very conservative in how they did
things. Their habits and customs did not change
appreciably from the 17th century to the early 19th
century. What has been learned in Florida (e.g.,
McEwan 1993) or California (e.g., Costello and
Hornbeck 1989) is probably applicable to what was
happening here as well.
Take the whole subject of food-where it was
coming from, how it was prepared and eaten, and
what was done with the garbage? Questions like
this may not seem earth-shaking at first, but everything we find on a site is related to them-hearths,
pottery sherds, and animal bone-and not just what
they are but where they are. Discussion of these
topics should be addressed in our final reports. It is
time for some of us to write discussions that cover
more than just the usual: where did we dig and
what artifacts did we find? Instead, we should discuss what we have learned, and how can a particular excavation project be related to earlier work at a
Spanish colonial site or at other similar ones? What
questions do we still need to answer, and how can
this be done?
Speaking of reports, we must do a better job of
communicating our results as quickly as possible as
the pace of Spanish colonial archeology quickens.
Publication seems to take anywhere from six months
to years or not at all. We need a means of sharing
publication titles and authors, if nothing else. This
does not mean we must hurry up and get the publication done and never mind the details, but it does
mean have it finished before the next project comes

along. How many of us do this now? We must try
harder. Perhaps we need a conference to discuss
this whole problem. Does every small testing project
of a Spanish colonial site need to produce a separate published report? Is there a more efficient way
to accomplish the exchange of information?
The scarcity of funding and pressure to preserve as much as possible of every Spanish colonial
site have often resulted in minimal excavations.
We may need to rethink this approach. Do we save
everything for the future at the expense of learning
what we need to know now? There must be a middle
ground. We are challenged to refine our excavation
and recording techniques in order to recover as
much as we can from every project. Concentrated
effort on detailed recording-maps, profiles, and
photographs-will pay off in many ways. Preparation of the report will be facilitated by providing
this information, and communication with the readers, both professional and avocational, will be improved. The next archeologist who follows that work
on the site will know exactly what was done and
where. The accumulation of knowledge contained
in carefully written site reports will benefit every
manager who later has to make decisions about the
future of the site.
At the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, we are learning that every hole in the
ground can tell us something, even if it is that
"there's nothing here." An orderly file of short reports from monitoring such small projects as tree
planting and drainage alterations is invaluable for
future planning of projects. We must not only monitor these alterations, but take notes, make sketches,
and file them where they can be found.
What happens to the field notes, drawings,
photographs, and artifacts when the project report
is finished? The excavation is not completed until
they are all put in order and deposited in a curation
facility where the rest of us can refer to them. This
is true for professional and avocational
archeologists. Having these materials remain on
the closet shelf or in our personal files will not help
anyone. Putting our site records in order is often
one of those things put off because we think it will
take too long, but this is not necessarily true. We
must sort things into folders, identify our
photographs, and then follow the instructions of the
facility where they are being taken for permanent
curation. The curation facilities will be glad to help
get materials in order and provide exact instructions

and guidance on what is needed to complete the
curation process,
So here is what we need to do:
More research in the archives: do not be
intimidated, just plunge in;
More consultation with historians: we have
a lot to offer them, as much as they have to
give us;
Careful planning when we write proposals
to be sure that the time and the budget are
adequate to do a good job;
Thoughtful recording of excavation results
and prompt report writing and publishing;
and
Curation. Get those collections out of the
closet.
It is exciting to see how many Texas archeologists are now beginning to take an interest in Spanish colonial sites. This should be encouraged by
those of us who are already doing this kind of
work, by readily sharing our knowledge and offering to advise and help other archeologists wherever
possible.
Finally, it is shameful to see that Ii ttle if any,
emphasis is put on colonial archeology in our Texas
colleges and universities. Course schedules would
have us believe that Texas archeology stops at the
end of the prehistoric period. Until students are
encouraged to undertake Spanish colonial topics
for thesis and dissertation research, we may well be
limited to the piecemeal recovery of information
from shovel tests and scattered one meter squares.

earlier, two-volume work (Webb 1952) and

supplement. Entries in these three works are
Indian Groups in Table 1.

erable uncertainty in some of the attributions even
at this coarse resolution. It is advisable for anyone
using this guide to consult groups in those areas
adjacent to their area of interest. An eighth geographic category identifies groups who entered
Texas from elsewhere as a direct result of displacement by European settlement. Also, no finer interval of time than a specific century is tabulated,
although most of the documents are dated and one
can find more specific chronological information
by consulting the New Handbook of Texas entries.
No effort has been made to augment information provided in each of the Handbook entries. For
example, in instances where a group's location is
given only in reference to some other named
group-group X lived inland from group Y-I did
not check the group Y entry for locational information, and thus either left the location blank in the
table or indicated an uncertain location.
Almost all of the entries have bibliographic
citations, which is one of the more valuable kinds
of information provided by The New Handbook of
Texas. The completeness of bibliographic citation

was based vary considerably by contributor.
Campbell, for example, researched a large number
of sources and considered synonymy, alternate
spellings, and other issues more systematically
than did some of the other contributors. Thus, the
contributor is identified by initials for each entry.

Artifacts, Archeology, and Cabeza de Vaca
Southern Texas and Northeastern Mexico

Thomas R. Hester

ABSTRACT
The route followed by Cabeza de Vaca across southern Texas and northern Mexico in 1534 has been the
subject of much debate among historians, anthropologists, and archeologists. Archeological data from the South
Texas and northeast Mexico area are offered as support for a "southern route" initially proposed by Alex D.
Krieger and later by T. N. Campbell.

INTRODUCTION
This article reviews, from an archeological
perspective, the route traveled by Alvar Nunez
Cabeza de Vaca in 1534 across southern Texas
and into northeastern Mexico. Of all the various
routes published for Cabeza de Vaca over the
past century, none make any sense (e.g., proposing a trek that went into East Texas or headed out
across the Edwards Plateau; cf. Pupo-Walker
1993 :Figure 1) in terms of the archeological and
ethnohistorical record, except those of Krieger
(1955, 1961, n.d.) and Campbell and Campbell
(1981). This route (see also Chipman 1987:143,
145; Olson et al. 1997; Howard 1997), hereafter
referred to as the "southern route" (Figure 1), takes
Cabeza de Vaca and his group from the upper and
central Texas coast, through southern Texas, into
northeastern Mexico, and perhaps back into western Texas (Figure 2).
Since the bulk of the archeological literature
for the major part of the route, that running across
southern Texas, has been generated in only the
last four decades, earlier scholars could not have
taken full advantage of the Cabeza de Vaca
chronicles in considering the various alternatives
for the route. Even today, we can push the "southern route" a bit further south than Krieger and
Campbell and Campbell because of what we have
learned archeologically in this region.

CABEZA DE VACA AND COASTAL
NATIVE GROUPS
Based on the recent archeological studies by
Ricklis (1994) on Galveston Island, new insights
can be added to the initial phase of Cabeza de
Vaca's capture and subsequent movements among
coastal peoples. The Narvaez expedition, of which
Cabeza de Vaca was a member, was shipwrecked
in 1528 on the upper Texas coast, at a location they
described as the Isla del Malhado; this was probably Galveston Island or a nearby area. The descriptions of the peoples they encountered match
closely the archeological remains found by Ricklis,
although they are perhaps broadly representative of
upper coastal cultural adaptations in the early 16th
century. Cabeza de Vaca records the use of the bow
and arrow, fish weirs or traps, and a heavy reliance
both on fish and roots during fall and winter on the
island, as well as the exchange of hawk bells and
beads, by the Spanish, for food and water (Krieger
n.d.:44ff) . Special mortuary treatment was reserved
for children and for "medicine men" (who were
cremated), and Ricklis found that most grave goods
were lavished on adult males and children. One
adult burial contained what Ricklis ( 1994:476) describes as a "rat-tooth bloodletting instrument,"
which he infers to be a "shaman's possession,"
albeit not with a cremation. This has a possible
link to an account of Cabeza de Vaca' s, at some

distance from the coast, and I will return to it later
in this article.
Ricklis' excavations at 41GV66 also produced
examples of probable dwellings. For example, Feature 110 was a distinct semi-circular depression,
with an arc-like series of postmolds on its south
side. Ricklis (1994:6) suggests that the clusters of
debris and postmolds found at the site would have
represented the types of flimsy mat-covered houses
noted by Cabeza de Vaca on the Isla del Malhado,
used by the inhabitants in the fall and winter. Krieger
(n.d.:47; see also Favata and Fernandez [1993:61])
notes that the Indians of Malhado spent three months
on the nearby mainland, staying until the end of
April, collecting oysters and "pitched their lodges on
oyster heaps." Ricklis found no such dwelling-types
in his fieldwork, though perhaps it is possible that
portions of oyster-shell clusters that he partially
exposed (e.g., Feature 106; see Ricklis [1994:69])
might be floors of small houses associated with the
flimsy dwellings described for the island.
Whether these peoples were Karankawa,
Akokisa, or some other group, Ricklis' work suggests that they were more complex in term of social
organization and belief systems than Cabeza de

19

Vaca recorded. There are tantalizing material culture details in
Cabeza de Vaca's account of the
island. For example, Covey
(1961:55; see also Favata and
Fernandez [1993:55]) notes that
an "earthen pot" was one of the
items (along with a domestic dog)
stolen from a native hut on the
island; a recent translation of
Cabeza de Vaca's account by
Maria Wade (The University of
Texas at Austin, Department. of
Anthropology) indicates that this
"pot" was an olla.
Ricklis' (1994) well-researched
study is highly recommended to
those who are deeply interested in
the earliest part of Cabeza de
Vaca' s saga in Texas, along and
near the Texas coast. My emphasis
(see Figures 1-2) will be on his
travels across southern Texas and
into northeastern Mexico.

CABEZA DE VACA
ASA TRADER

It is during Cabeza de Vaca's presence among
the coastal groups that we learn much about material culture, especially the kinds that survive
archeologically, and this comes from his role as a
trader. This began in 1530 when he lived among
the "people of Charruco" in the coastal zone south
of Galveston Island. Much has been written about
Cabeza de Vaca as a trader (e.g., Corgan 1969;
Wade 1996), but here I will focus specifically on
the material goods that he exported and imported,
and what that tells us archeologically.
Wade (1996 personal communication) in her
personal translation of Cabeza de Vaca's account,
indicates that the items he took with him from the
coast were: pieces of "sea snails" (conch or other
gastropods) and their "hearts" (here, he must be
referring to the columella of the conch, widely
prized as a raw material), and shells to cut a fruitlike bean with which they cure and make bailes
and fiestas. This "bean" would not have survived
archeologically, although the identity of this vegetal item would be important.

20

Texas Archeological Society

With these goods, Cabeza de Vaca traveled
into the interior, apparently crossing territories
without conflict. The latter is also of considerable
interest, because the region was characterized by
continuous inter-group warfare during this time,
and most, if not all, groups apparently had welldemarcated territories (cf. Krieger n.d.:47, who
notes that the trader [Cabeza de Vaca] could move
freely, but not the Indians). Mariah Wade (1998;
see Wade, this volume) notes a similar concern
with territories among groups in southwest Texas
in the 17th century.
It is probable that Cabeza de Vaca's activities
were part of a trading system of great time depth in
coastal and southern Texas. Indeed, there is ample
archeological evidence, on which I have written
several times, of pre-Hispanic trade involving these
two regions (cf. Hester 197la, 197lb, 1980, 1995).
Once in the interior, he traded his coastal goods
for the following items, again based on Wade's
recent translation: "skins," "red dirt with which
they grease and paint their faces and hair" [hematite or red ocher], chert [pedernales] points of arrows, hard cane to make arrow shafts [flechas],
glue, and "some tassels which they make of skin of
deer and dye red."
Cabeza de Vaca's trading endeavors closely
match the archeological record of southern Texas,
perhaps even that of Central Texas and the lower
Pecos. Covey's (1961) suggestions of his incursions going into East Texas and Oklahoma can be
discounted. The Texas coast was without chippable
stone (chert or "flint") and since Archaic times,
there is ample evidence of South and Central Texas
cherts being obtained by coastal peoples to make
spear and arrow points. This may have even accelerated in Late Prehistoric times, roughly the era of
Cabeza de Vaca, when bison hunting became important on the coastal prairies-and thus the need
for more chert for arrow points, end scrapers, knives,
and perforators (Hester and Parker 1970). Chert of
variable quality is available on the lower Nueces
and the lower Guadalupe rivers 15-50 miles upstream from the coast (Chandler 1984).
Red ochre or hematite appears in coastal burials (e.g., Hester 1969), as well as in those on the
coastal/interior ecotone, such as the Archaic cemetery at Loma Sandia (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Skins, arrow shafts, and tassels have left no archeological trace. I am not sure what "glue" the coastal
peoples desired from the interior, perhaps sap from

mesquite or similar trees which produce resins that
make a good mastic; however, the coastal peoples
had available, and had used since at least 600-800
B.C., asphaltum that washed up on the beaches, and
which could be melted and used as an adhesive.
In the interior, marine shell is present at many
sites (cf. Hester 1971a, 1971b, 1980; Black 1986;
Highley 1986). Indeed, ornaments of marine shell
imported from the Texas coast are found as early as
5800 years ago at the Bering Sink mortuary site in
Kerr County (Bement 1994). Marine shell usually
occurs as scattered specimens, especially conch shell
fragments, conch columella (often made into either
tools or disc-shaped beads), and fragments of ribbed
cockle shell such as Dinocardium robustum. Here
again, it is my distinct impression that the very late
Late Prehistoric peoples had more of this material,
as at the Hinojosa site near Alice (Black 1986) and
site 41LK201 on the Frio River west of Three Rivers (Highley 1986). An alternative to trade would
be interaction between coastal and interior groups.
For instance, Ricklis (1996) has suggested contemporary co-habitation of a coastal margin site,
41RF21, and perhaps during such events, trade
would have taken place. And, yet another alternative would have been the seasonal transhumance of
coastal groups to the prickly pear fields in the interior, well documented by Cabeza de Vaca. However, given the time depth of such trade in the
interior of South, Central, and lower Pecos Texas, I
suspect that some other mechanism led to an intensification of exchange in the Late Prehistoric.

CABEZA DE VA CA'S JOURNEY
THROUGH THE INTERIOR
Cabeza de Vaca's activities on the margin of the
coastal prairies, and then his journey across the interior to the Rio Grande raise several archeological
issues. For example, references to subsistence activities are of interest. While living with the Mariames
on the lower Guadalupe River (we assume), Cabeza
de Vaca and his colleagues were involved in the
processing of pecans. This may have involved ground
stone manos and metates, or even the use of stone
pestles. Alternatively, they may have used wooden
mortars and pestles of the sort reported
ethnohistorically in Nuevo Leon in the 17th century
by Alonso de Leon (Brown 1988; see also Beals
1932), and archeologically, from the lower Pecos

Hester-Artifacts, Archeology, and Cabeza de Vaca
area by Collins and Hester (1968) and Prewitt (1981 ).
Cabeza de Vaca noted wooden pestles in use by
Indian groups west of present-day Falcon Reservoir
(Krieger n.d.:78) In addition, the harvesting and processing of tuna, the fruit of prickly pears, might have
involved similar gear, or just an earthen pit.
It is significant that when, in 1532, Cabeza de
Vaca and colleagues are involved in the summer
harvesting of prickly pear tuna, there is no mention
of pottery, which would have been ideal for the
storage of beverages made from tuna juices (cf.
Krieger 1956:53); indeed, he mentions a "lack of
vessels" for the juice from the tunas (Favata and
Fernandez [1993:75] also note that these Indians
"have no vessels"). Either this is specific only to
the group with whom Cabeza de Vaca was associated, his failure to note similar plainware ceramics,
or his route across southern Texas was a bit farther
south than the "southern route" currently suggests.
I can say this with confidence in that the peoples of
the southern Texas interior had begun making bonetempered pottery, including olla forms, as early as
A.D. 1200-1300, or perhaps even 200-300 years
earlier (cf. Hester 1980:126; Highley 1986). It continued to be manufactured through the Late Prehistoric and during the time the regional Indian groups
were residing in the 18th century Spanish missions.
Pottery was being made as far south as Alice, and
clearly north of a line running from Dimmit County
down to Alice and eastward to Baffin Bay. Thus,
the map of Cabeza de Vaca' s journey might be
more accurately drawn as running south of Alice
(see Campbell and Campbell 1981:Figure 1)-or
his route took a decided southern turn (cf. Chipman
1987: 131 ). I doubt the latter is the case as the Wells
and Davenport route discussed by Chipman (1987)
would have put the castaways in the South Texas
Sand Sheet area, a patch of South Texas that Cabeza
de Vaca would have surely remembered! Indeed, if
Cabeza de Vaca was among the Avavares, whose
territory included the legendary great prickly pear
fields, he would then have been in Webb, Duval,
and southern Jim Wells counties, south of the pottery-making peoples.

CABEZA DE VACA'S RECORD
OF STONE ARTIFACTS
Cabeza de Vaca also made an interesting record
of stone artifacts while among the A vavares, when

21

he was told of the myth of Mala Cosa, the Badthing.
Mala Cosa used a "flint knife two palms long and a
hand wide" (Covey 1961:90) to inflict wounds on
hapless individuals. There is no raw material in
southern Texas that would have allowed the
Avavares to have even dreamed of a stone tool of
that size (the Uvalde and Rio Grande gravels used
for points and everyday tools are relatively small
cobbles). Additionally, while among the Avavares,
another group, the Cutalchiches, were in residence
(a village of 50 dwellings, see Krieger n.d.:74).
Cabeza de Vaca reports that "they gave us flints up
to a palm and a half long, which they use for cutting and which they highly prize." A description of
such massive bifaces may reflect what we see
archeologically in the region, and that is the presence of large, thin bifaces ("knives," Figure 3) that
have been traded into the region from the Edwards
Plateau, placed in burials and in non-burial caches
(e.g., Hester and Barber 1990; Miller 1993; Hester
1995: Figure 19; Taylor and Highley 1995; Boyd et
al. 1997).

OBSERVATIONS ON SUBSISTENCE
AND SETTLEMENT
It should also be noted that this area of Cabeza
de Vaca's route, especially Starr, Zapata, and Jim
Hogg counties, has a high density of prickly pear,
but little in the way of creeks or other surface water
(Hester 1981). This area and the area to the east
could have been the territories of the Avavares (at
least seasonally), and certainly the Arbadaos
(Campbell and Campbell 1981), and the dire descriptions of their subsistence, during Cabeza de
Vaca's eight months in the monte, would certainly
fit with the settlement pattern and low-density resource model that I have put forth for the region
(Hester 1981; why Covey [1961:92] equates this
locale with the Texas "hill country" is indeed a
mystery). Cabeza de Vaca's stay among the
Cuchendados (Campbell and Campbell 1981:39)
on the Rio Grande demonstrates his adaptation to
life in the region (Wade 1996) and his skills at
making items of material culture, such as mats,
which were greatly prized as house coverings in
what appear to have been at least a couple of sizable villages.
Cabeza de Vaca offers other insights into subsistence that have archeological implications. He

22

the fact that the Mariame and related groups
ate practically everything. This is borne out
by the long lists of faunal remains at Late
Prehistoric sites in the region (e.g., Hester and
Hill 1975; Black 1986, Highley 1986). It is
intriguing that he notes the pulverization of
bone, to reduce these materials to bone grease
to be mixed with other foods. This is a well
known practice among southern California Indians (Bean 1972:66). However, faunal remains are so extensive and so well preserved
at most Late Prehistoric sites in South Texas
that this technology must have been used either with certain species, certain times of the
year, or in cases of famine/hunger. Krieger
(1956:53) reports that snails (land, or prairie
snails; Rabdotus sp.) were also eaten, although
I cannot locate this reference in the published
translations. Campbell (1983) also reports the
eating of snails by the Mariame while they
were in the tuna fields.
However, the archeological evidence is
overwhelming in terms of snail consumption.
Along the central and southern coast, on the
coastal prairies, and into the interior, Late
Prehistoric sites have abundant land snails in
the middens. Some archeologists and other
scientists attribute their presence to the scavenging activities of land snails, but this is a
facile argument that ignores the archeological data, that is to say their association with
hearths and food processing areas (cf. Scott
1982; Black 1986; Highley 1986). If the snails
got incorporated into the middens as casual
scavengers, then they have clearly changed

at this period on the coastal prairies (cf. Hester
one recorded in McMullen County (Hester et al.
and Parker 1970; Ricklis 1996). He also points to

Hester-Artifacts, Archeology, and Cabeza de Vaca
1975) may be similar. There are, however, a variety of hearths, including charcoal and rock-filled
features, that might have served in this fashion
(as at Choke Canyon; Scott 1982). While Cabeza
de Vaca disparages the Indians' use of fire to
burn off the prairies, this was a widespread practice in Texas and the Great Plains. Archeological
evidence of such activities is, of course, hard to
come by, although McGraw (1983:91) recorded
thin lines of charcoal in excavation profiles near
Laredo that might reflect such events. Megan
Biesele and Steve Barclay (1997 personal communication) report the use of "flash-fires" by the
San in Namibia to remove grasses (without damaging fruit-bearing trees), which within a few
days are replaced by green shoots attracting kudu
to the area (and making the kudu easier to track,
with their hoof prints easy to spot in the sootcovered earth).
I have always been bothered by Cabeza de
Vaca's descriptions of hunger, famine, and low
quantities of food just about everywhere he went
(these descriptions have been embellished; cf.
Krieger 1956). This simply does not fit with the
archeological evidence, in terms of faunal remains
(animals, fish, marine or freshwater shell, snails,
etc.) that occur in sites in the area where he must
have traveled. Perhaps his eight months in the
monte in the South Texas interior reflected seasonal variations in food availability as recorded
by Alonso de Leon (Brown 1988). Or perhaps he
was there in a time of drought; having just been in
the area currently suffering from a significant
drought, I can imagine the shortage of resources
he encountered. Or perhaps his descriptions reflect his bias as a European who had to subsist on
unfamiliar and distasteful foods.
The settlement pattern described for the
Mariame and associated groups, to be near wood
and water, fits what is seen for the placement of
prehistoric occupation sites in the region (Cabeza
de Vaca later contradicts himself by noting that
the Indians "have no familiar places for getting
water" [Covey 1961:83]). Perhaps here he referred
to groups deeper into South Texas, where creeks
and water sources were indeed fewer (the lowdensity zones described by Hester [1981]). The
brevity with which the sites were occupied likely
suggests repeated occupations over the years, again
fitting with the "settlement zones" seen in the areas
of higher density resources in the region (Hester

23

1981). Some sites were apparently occupied long
enough for houses, albeit flimsy ones, to be set up.
Archeological evidence for such houses is limited
to a few postmolds or trash distribution patterns
from a few sites (cf. Black 1986:266).

CABEZA DE VACA CROSSES
THE RIO GRANDE
Cabeza de Vaca' s projected entry into Mexico
near what is today the Falcon Reservoir district is
probably accurate. If the Avavares' homeland was
indeed southwest of Alice, in northern Duval
County (cf. Krieger n.d.:78), Cabeza de Vaca and
his group could have continued southwestward
and crossed the Rio Grande in that locale. His
party said mountain ranges were off to the west,
and Jack T. Hughes notes (1998 personal communication) that Alex Krieger, when visiting Hughes'
Falcon excavations in the early 1950s, was amazed
at the view of these mountains (the flanks of the
Sierra Madre Oriental), looking from the field
camp atop a bluff on the north side of the river.
After wading chest-high across the river, the
group went to a village of 100 or more "lodges"
(Favata and Fernandez 1993:92). That such large
villages were in that area is highly likely. The
work done by James B. Boyd (Boyd et al. 1997),
including the documentation of several cemeteries, appears consistent with significant Late Prehistoric population concentrations (Boyd et al.
1997; Hester 1995). In the large village visited by
Cabeza de Vaca were Indians using rattles, fashioned of gourds filled with pebbles. Evidence for
such rattles have been found both at Loma Sandia
(Taylor and Highley 1995:483-484), in the Falcon
Reservoir area, and in ethnohistoric accounts from
the lower Rio Grande Valley (Salinas 1990). Regarding the gourds themselves, there has been
much debate as to their source, although the native Texas gourd (Cucurbita texana) that occurs
in Central Texas, along the Guadalupe River, and
elsewhere, would have been available, albeit for a
fairly small rattle (cf. Heiser 1985:64-65). Additionally, A veleyra Arroyo de Anda et al. (1956)
report a gourd dipper from Cueva la Paila in southwestern Coahuila. This particular gourd is larger
and apparently represented a cultivated species;
since gourds were domesticated very early in
Mesoamerica (Heiser 1985), the specimen seen by

24

Texas Archeological Society

Cabeza de Vaca could have been either of a native
Texas species or a gourd/gourd rattle traded into
the area, perhaps from the Huasteca.
When Cabeza de Vaca moved west from the
Rio Grande, he entered territory that is still very
poorly known archeologically-especially in Late
Prehistoric times. No major excavations or studies
have dealt with this terminal portion of the culture
sequence in the region, and those that have, usually involved rockshelters (cf. Hester et al. 1994),
a settlement type not described in Cabeza de
Vaca's chronicle.
Cabeza de Vaca notes, as he moves away from
the Rio Grande, the presence of "corn flour." If
this is indeed an accurate reference to maize, it
may indicate horticulture in some portion of the
northeast Mexico coastal plain. However, less than
150 miles to the south are Huastecan villages (e.g.,
Wilson and Warren 1975), and cultigens may have
been obtained from them. As Cabeza de Vaca
moves farther into Coahuila, he also notes "pifion
pine," whose nuts were paper-thin. Olson et al.
(1997) report the presence of this specific pifion
species in the central mountains of Coahuila, "exactly on [the] route as projected by Krieger" (Olson
et al. 1997:176, 186). It was also in this area of
eastern Coahuila that Cabeza de Vaca carried out
his storied surgery, removing a projectile point
from a man's chest; earlier studies of Cabeza de
Vaca's route place this in areas ranging from West
Texas to the Pueblo area in the Southwest (cf.
Favata and Fernandez 1993:126). Beyond this area,
and still in eastern Coahuila, Cabeza de Vaca describes rabbit-hunting sticks (probably much like
those found at Cueva de la Candelaria in southwestern Coahuila [Aveleyra Arroyo de Anda et al.
1956:141, 143, 189],aswellasthoseintheLower
Pecos [Shafer 1986]). He also reports wooden
cradle frames (Aveleyra Arroyo de Anda et al.
1956:151-152) and the presence of bison hides.
The presence of bison hides in northeastern Mexico
likely reflects two phenomena that Wade (1998)
has recently reported. Seventeenth century expeditions observed bison in Coahuila, south of the
Rio Grande, and also recorded the practice of Indian groups from northeastern Mexico traveling at
times north of the Rio Grande to hunt buffalo and
then to return to their home territory.
However, there is a much discussed incident
involving material culture that I would like to
touch upon. This is the "copper" bell or rattle

(described as "squat and wide;" M. Wade, 1996
personal communication) given to Dorante "at
the base of the mountains" (Covey 1961:110;
Ketchum 1988; Epstein 1991). Cabeza de Vaca
relates that the gift-givers had obtained the artifact from the "north." This has led many to speculate that it is derived from Casas Grandes, the
great trading and craft production center in Chihuahua studied by Di Peso (1974), who notes
Casas Grandes trade networks reaching to La
Junta de los Rios and other northern Mexico locales. It may have indeed come from there (or
from other Southwestern sources; see Vargas
1995), but I suggest an alternate scenario. If the
Krieger route is correct (cf. Chipman 1987:143),
this event probably took place south of Monterrey.
This is only 250 miles from the Pavon site, on
the Rio Panuco, in the Huastecan culture area. At
this site, Ekholm (1944:478-479) reports and illustrates large copper bells (including one strikingly similar to a specimen from Casas Grandes,
see DiPeso [1974:510]), and notes several others, including one in the form of a turtle (the one
given Dorante apparently had a "face" or image
on it) in the Huasteca. Indeed, Huastecan outposts
in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, occupied at the time
of Cabeza de Vaca (the Mesoamerican Late
Postclassic) were within 150 miles or less. The
Huastecans were very active traders, as seen in
their interaction with the hunters and gatherers of
the Brownsville complex in the Rio Grande delta,
where obsidian, pottery, and jade is documented
(see Hester [1995] for a detailed review). Further,
despite all the ruminations in the various translations, could the "South Sea" and its riches not be
the Pacific or the Bay of California, but the Gulf
of Mexico with its Huastecan towns and traders?
At the end of the route with which I am
concerned in this article, I will close with some
observations on the material culture related to the
famed "mouse-teeth" bloodletting or scarification
event (Covey 1961:113; "rat's teeth," in Krieger
[n.d.:109]). It is hard to say where this took place,
although Krieger's route suggests it could have
been in the Big Bend area (Olson 1997: 176),
somewhere perhaps about four days west of La
Junta de los Rios, or even in the Presidio, Texas

While I am not equating the Val Verde
County jackrabbit mandibles with Ricklis'
(1994) comb-like apparatus, with rats' teeth
mounted in asphaltum (and which he
describes as a shaman's bloodletting tool),
the Cabeza de Vaca narrative indicates that
persons other than shamans may have been
involved in bloodletting or scarification.
As we depart the "southern route," as
Cabeza de Vaca heads to the Rio Grande in
the Junta de los Rios area, he records his
interaction with bison hunters, who do their
cooking by stone boiling in gourds, and who
have acquired cotton blankets. Krieger
(n.d.: 112) believes these peoples to have
been the Jumanos. Hamilton (1999) reports
woven cotton, cotton lint, and cotton seeds
from Granado Cave (41CU8) in Culberson
County. Although this is far to the north of
Cabeza de Vaca' s route in the Big Bend
area, it nonetheless illustrates the presence
of these materials in western Texas, doubtless acquired through trade with Southwestern cultures.

a "shaman's kit" or a "medicine bundle." Among the
contents are mescal beans (hallucinogens?) and buckeyes
(for fish poison?) and 11 halves of jackrabbit mandibles.
It is not hard to imagine these latter items being used for
bloodletting scarification, especially in the scene
described by Cabeza de Vaca. While he relates the event
as one in which parents are punishing a crying infant, it
is possible that he was witnessing a scarification scene.

Unfolding Native American
The Entrada of
Manuel De La Cruz
and the Bosque-Larios Expedition
Mariah F. Wade

ABSTRACT
In the 1670s Texas did not exist as a colonial province of New Spain. At that time, and later still, the history
of Texas was enmeshed with the history of Coahuila as were the lives of many Native American groups. The
archival information that pertains to the events before and after the entrada of Fr. Manuel de la Cruz and the
Bosque-Larios expedition has been misquoted, poorly researched, and is in some cases unknown. By casting a
broad contextual net and doing detailed translations it is possible to obtain information on Native American
cultural behavior and the local environment. This article uses archival materials from the 1650s to the 1670s,
including the entrada of Fr. Manuel de la Cruz and the Bosque-Larios expedition, to discuss Native requests for
settlement, the impact of the work of the Franciscan friars on the Native populations, as well as Native
movements, group coalitions, and Native control of land areas and resources. I also provide a list of the Native
American groups who inhabited or used the southwest portion of the Texas Edwards Plateau in 1674-1675.

PREAMBLE
In 1932, Francis Borgia Steck published an
article entitled "Forerunners of Captain de Leon's
Expedition to Texas, 1670-1675." The article, based
on Spanish archival documents, brought to light
important events related to the work of the
Franciscan friars in Coahuila and Texas in the late
1600s. Although Steck's approach to the archival
material is completely understandable, it is unfortunate that Steck did not explore the full potential
of this documentation, and, in at least a few important points, his article led to some confusion and
misunderstandings.
This article presents most of the documents
alluded to or referenced by Steck (1932), and locates the relevant archival repositories. I fully translated all the documents relating to this early period
(about 120 pages and 16 different documents).
These documents, and others discussed herein, span
several years and relate events in the areas of
Saltillo, Coahuila, and Texas. I made a conscious
effort to retain the tone and language of the documents that were translated. Thus, the majority of
the reported events are rendered almost as a direct
translation. Due to space constraints, I could not

include the Spanish textual version as often as
wished. However, in some cases where the information provided by the documents is considered
very important, controversial, or was incorrectly
reported by Steck (1932), the Spanish quotes have
been included. Differences in the spelling of Native
names and personal names appear in the original
texts. This article also includes arc hi val material
heretofore not published except for the author's
dissertation (Wade 1998); this material covers the
period of 1658 and some of the documents for
1673. This documentation is summarized in the
present article to allow for development and analysis of the material that was not fully reported and
explored by Steck (1932).

INTRODUCTION
The Spanish entrada of Fr. Manuel de la Cruz
(1674) and the expedition of Bosque-Larios (1675)
into the southwest part of the modern territory of
Texas provide temporal and spatial windows into
the lives of Native groups and the historical events
that shaped their lives. The sequence of events that
culminated in the Bosque-Larios expedition began

Bulletin of the Texas Arclieological Society 70 (1999)

to unfold in 1658, and is intrinsically connected
with Fr. Manuel's entrada. This article focuses primarily on the events that preceded the BosqueLarios expedition, and discusses how those events
were shaped by the actions of particular Native
groups and their spokespersons.
The picture that emerges from the Spanish archival documentation pertaining to this stream of
events clearly indicates that the majority of the
groups involved had considerable populations, were
organized in broad multi-ethnic coalitions, and controlled sophisticated information networks. Some
of these groups and their spokespersons were the
primary initiators of the movement to establish Native settlements. The evidence also indicates that
some Native groups controlled and defended specific geographic areas and the harvesting of resources within those land areas. A reshuffling and
bid for control of some of those areas and resources
may have been underway at the time of the entradas.
This realignment appears to have been a major
source of conflict between group coalitions.
Face to face with imminent culture change,
brought about by the presence of Europeans, Native American groups on both sides of the Rio
Grande were devising ways to incorporate and deflect the potential effects of those changes. In the
long run, the events that resulted from these entradas
thwarted the Natives' intents, but their actions testify to their insight and enterprising ability within
complex political and economical situations.

THE ENTRADA OF FR. MANUEL DE
LA CRUZ AND THE EXPEDITION
OF FR. JUAN LARIOS AND
LIEUTENANT FERNANDO
DELBOSQUE
The entradas of Fr. Manuel de la Cruz and
Bosque-Larios have been portrayed as efforts to
Christianize the Native populations and survey the
country north of the Rio Grande. There is no question that these were some of the motivations of the
colonizers, but the Spanish impetus for those
entradas, and the Native motives that fostered those
trips, have not been investigated or discussed. The
lack of scrutiny of the primary sources has produced, at best, a lopsided view of the events, and at
worse, it has presented Native groups as passive
subjects in the process of change.

The appointment of Don Antonio Balcarcel de
Ribadeneyra y Sottomayor as Alcalde Mayor of
Coahuila was the catalyst for the Bosque-Larios
expedition into modem Texas territory. However,
the proximal causes that led to the solo trip of Fr.
Manuel de la Cruz and the official entrada of
Bosque-Larios were deeply rooted in early Native
resettlement attempts. Some of the Native groups
and Spanish individuals who played a role in those
entradas had been involved in attempts to establish
Native pueblos in Coahuila and in colonization efforts before Balcarcel arrived in Coahuila in November 1674.

PAST EVENTS

1658
In March 1658, Miguel de Otalona, War Captain and Judge in Saltillo, heard testimony from
army personnel and the citizenry of Saltillo relative to a request made by four Babane and Jumano
individuals to establish a pueblo of their own.
These individuals had visited Viceroy Duque de
Albuquerque ( 1653-1660) to present their request,
and the Viceroy ordered the matter investigated
(Otalona 1658).
Testimony of the various witnesses shows that
the request made by the Babane and Jumano argued that the encomenderos of Saltillo rounded up
Natives in Coahuila for their encomiendas, imprisoned the children of Native workers to force their
parents to remain in the haciendas, and did not pay
the Natives for their work. In their request to establish a settlement, these Native Americans begged
the Viceroy to provide them with 15 Tlascaltecan
families in order that both groups could settle and
be Christianized together. Some of the witnesses
testified that they had been in the province since
1618. They stated that they had known the Babane
and the Jumano for a long time. It appears that
these Native groups may have been in the area at
least since the 1620s (Morales 1658; Otalona 1658).
Local Spanish officials and encomenderos objected vehemently to this petition. Their arguments
stated that: (1) these Natives had no pueblo and no
Native following since they had always been
encomendados; (2) the Natives wished to gather in
a pueblo only to return to their barbaric customs
and be free to commit all sorts of depredations
without fear of punishment; (3) the encomenderos

Wade- Unfolding Native American History
provided for all the Natives' physical and spiritual
needs, which would not be met if they were in a
pueblo; (4) if they were allowed to leave Saltillo
they would retire to the mountains, where the
encomenderos could not reach them, and finally (5)
if these Natives left, others would follow, and the
Province would be ruined, since the encomenderos
did not have a labor force to work the farms. If that
occurred, they would have to abandon the province. The farmers of Saltillo collectively sent a
petition to Viceroy Duque de Albuquerque, and the
matter was closed (Aguirre et al. 1673a).
1673-1674
Fifteen years later the issue resurfaced. In April
1673, Don Marcos, a Juman, appeared before General Echeberz y Subic;a in Saltillo to request settlement in a pueblo. Don Marcos was accompanied by
his brother, Don Lacaro Agustin, a Juman, and by
Don Marcos, a Babane. General Echeberz y Subic;a
appointed Fr. Juan Larios as interpreter of the proceedings because of his proficiency in the Mexican
language (Echeberz y Subic;a 1673a). General
Echeberz y Subic;a told Don Marcos to bring the
Natives of his group and following (nacion y
sequito) to discuss the matter of settlement. Don
Marcos replied that there were only three people
left of his group. Those who sent him to request a
pueblo were the Bobole and their allies (y otros
agregados suios), who lived in the province of
Coahuila and Valley of the Buffalo (Agustin l 673a).
General Echeberz y Subic;a convened a meeting of prominent citizens to evaluate the merits of
the request and provide information on the character and intentions of the petitioners. Most of the
military and church officials who testified stated
that they knew Lacaro Agustin and the others, and
that it was not a bad idea to establish a pueblo for
them in Coahuila. The area needed to be explored
and had promising mining possibilities, but it
would be essential to place a presidio in the area.
They were of the opinion that it would not be easy
to sustain a pueblo in Coahuila because of the
many rebel and non-Christian peoples that inhabited it, and also because the Natives were not
accustomed to labor for their sustenance but survived on what the earth provided. Furthermore,
they stated, it would be difficult to control them
and prevent their return to a sinful and barbaric
way of life (Salac;ar 1673).

31

Nicolas Flores, one of the witnesses, declared
that he had known Lacaro Agustin since he was a
boy and that Lacaro had been raised in Saltillo.
He had no Native following except for his brother,
or uncle (Don Marcos), who was also a party to
the petition (Flores 1673). Captain Domingo de
Menchaca, who had also been in Coahuila before
the area was abandoned by the Spaniards, declared that he knew Agustin and the other Natives. He testified that when he was in Coahuila
he had seen many rancherias of people with the
same language and customs (de la misma lengua
y costumbres) as those who wished to gather in a
pueblo (Menchaca 1673).
On June 30, 1673, the petitioners were given to
understand that their request was going to be
granted. Don Lacaro was ordered to bring before
Echeberz y Subic;a the Natives who were a part of
the request for settlement (Echeberz y Subic;a
1673b). Don Lacaro stated that he would get the
Bobole and their allies (agregados) to come in person and "state their needs as kin that they all were
since they understood each other in a mother language and were all natives of the province of
Coahuila" (y juntas pidiriamos do que nos combiese
como parientes que somos todos pues nos
entendemos en una lengua materna originarios de
la dicha probincia de cohaila) (Aguirre et al.
l 673b). Don Lacaro included in the group of petitioners the Bobole, Baias, Contotore, Tetecore, and
half of the Momone. Two other very large groups
were also joining: the Guequechale and the Tiltic y
Maigunm. At this meeting Don Lacaro was accompanied by a Christian Gueiquechali Captain by the
name of Don Esteban, two non-Christian Captains,
and 28 Bobole and Temmanar individuals (Aguirre
et al. 1673b; Agustin 1673b).
Don Lacaro stated that the Bobole had over
300 warriors and that they had been in Coahuila
since time immemorial (desde tiempo ymmemorial).
The Bobole stated that they had lost many people
in wars and could not maintain their rancheria unless they congregated with other groups. Don Lacaro
added that the Bobole had always been loyal to the
Spaniards. He mentioned the help given by the
Bobole during the battle of Don Fernando de Asco
(Azcue) against the Cacaltles and their allies
(Echeberz y Subic;a 1673b). The intervention of 50
Bobole warriors gave the victory to Azcue and made
possible the chastisement of the Tetecore and
Contotore. Don Lacaro also mentioned that the other

32

Texas Archeological Society

nation who was joining them (Gueiquesale or
Catujano?) was from the east and that he did not
know the boundaries of their lands (Aguirre et al.
1673b; Menchaca 1673).
After all the witnesses had testified, the consensus was that Don Lacaro Agustin was a savy
ladino who incited other groups to rebellion, and
that he had nothing to do with the help given to
Fernando Azcue. General Echeberz y Subii;a asked
the Town Council (Cabildo) for a decision on the
affair. After deliberations, the Cabildo stated that it
was very convenient and useful to establish a pueblo
such as the one requested by the Native petitioners,
if the town had the military force and resources to
guarantee its survival. Since that could not be done,
and the creation of such a pueblo would strain the
town's resources and cause its ruin, the request was
denied (Aguirre et al. 1673a, 1673b; Echeberz y
Subii;a 1673b, 1673c).
In September 1673, Fray Larios traveled to
Guadalajara accompanied by 20 Native Americans
(Ardenol 1673a). This group of Native Americans
came to plead their case for settlement before the
Audiencia de Guadalajara on behalf of 24 groups.
Among the Native visitors were Don Lazaro
Agustin, Don Marcos, and a Native named Juan.
These Native ambassadors were protesting the offenses committed against them by the
encomenderos, including the use of military force
by the officials in Saltillo to prevent Fr. Larios and
the Native groups from moving into Coahuila
(Ardenol 1673a:40-42). During their three-month
sojourn in Guadalajara, the Native group was housed
at the San Francisco Convent where eight Native
Americans were publicly and solemnly baptized.
The last of the baptismal ceremonies took place on
November 27, 1673 (Ardenol 1673a:37-38). The
following day Fr. Larios, Fr. Pefiasco, Fr. Manuel
de la Cruz, and the Native Americans returned to
Saltillo. The whole group was escorted with great
pomp to the outskirts of Guadalajara by the ecclesiastic authorities, including the Bishop of New
Galicia, Don Francisco Verdin y Molina (Ardenol
1673b).
This trip to Guadalajara resulted, in part, from
a formal complaint made by Captain Francisco de
Barbarigo against the Alcalde Mayor of Saltillo,
Juan de Maya. In response to the complaint, the
Audiencia de Guadalajara sent Don Martin Moreno
to Saltillo to investigate the charges. Traveling with
Don Martin Moreno were Don Antonio Balcarcel

and Miguel Thomas de Ascoide (Ardenol
1673a:46). In December 1673, Don Martin Moreno,
Miguel Thomas de Ascoide, and Antonio Balcarcel
testified to the conflicts they had witnessed in
Saltillo and to the tense situation existing between
the friars, the Native Americans, the encomenderos,
and the Saltillo authorities. In his deposition,
Balcarcel (Ardenol 1673a:43) attested that he had
personally talked with the Native representatives.
He stated that all together the 24 nations mustered
about 3,700 warriors and about 12,000 people (y
reducido a numero alto ser tres mil y setecientos
yndios de armas en que se supone y reconosse este
testigo seran mas de dose mill almas) (Ardenol
1673a:43). Despite these events, in December 1673,
the Governor of Saltillo ordered presidia! troops to
subdue nine rebel Native groups. On December
29th, the troops vanquished the rebels, took their
possessions, and reduced the males to slavery
(Larios 1674a: 136).
In November 1673, when Fr. Larios returned
to Saltillo with Fr. Francisco Pefiasco and Fr.
Manuel de la Cruz, he had obtained official permission to missionize in Coahuila (Ardenol 1673b;
Mohedano 1673). It appears that the inquiries ordered by the Audiencia de Guadalajara had led to a
change of attitudes, and sometime in early 1674 the
friars established the first mission settlements in
Coahuila. On December 30, 1673, the group of
Natives who had pledged peace and were returning
from Guadalajara were given 30 fanegas (77 bushels) of com and five heifers (Barbarigo 1674a:l02).
In January 1674, Captain Francisco Elizondo
was ordered to proceed to Coahuila to establish
pueblos for Don Marcos, a Babane, and his allies
(Elizondo 1674:65). When Elizondo arrived at
Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe (Monclova), 35
leagues (91 miles) from Saltillo, he learned that the
friars and the natives were further inland. Elizondo
sent a courier to inform Fr. Larios that he would
wait four days (until January 23rd or 24th) to meet
them and to give official possession of the lands to
the Natives (Elizondo 1674:66). By January 24th,
since Elizondo had not heard from Fr. Larios, he
decided to proceed in search of the friars. He continued northward to Santa Cruz de las Penuelas,
located beyond the Nadadores River and halfway
between the Nadadores and the Sabinas rivers. After reaching Santa Cruz he traveled about 14 leagues
(36.4 miles) northward from Santa Cruz. At this
place Captain Elizondo met two Xicocoge who in-

Wade formed him that Don Marcos, his allies, and the
friars were on the Sabinas River (Elizondo 1674:67).
Elizondo's party traveled to the Sabinas River. On
January 26th, he stopped 60 leagues (156 miles)
north of Saltillo upon being met by two Natives
who were carrying a letter from Fr. Larios. Larios
reported that on January 22nd, he had arrived at a
rancheria of the Bobole, Gueiquechale, Tiltiqui,
and Mayhuam and other allied groups. These groups
were camped about 10 leagues (26 miles) beyond
the Sabinas River toward the Rio Grande because
of the smallpox. Since Elizondo's deadline had expired, and Fr. Larios did not wish to leave those
who were sick, he promised that as soon as the
epidemic subsided he would place them in pueblos
and would inform Elizondo (Elizondo 1674:68-69).
However, when Fr. Larios learned that Captain
Elizondo had not departed for Saltillo, he traveled 4
leagues (10.4 miles) further to San Ildefonso, where
he arrived January 23rd (Elizondo 1674:68; Larios
1674b: 111).
Captain Elizondo joined Fr. Larios and several
Native Captains at San Ildefonso de la Paz, 14
leagues north of the Sabinas River. On January
28th, according to Elizondo, he was visited by the
Captains of the Gueiquechale, Bobole, Manos
Prietas, Pinanaca, Obaya, Babaymare, Zupulame,
Omomone, and Xicocoge. Fr. Larios, on the other
hand, states that they were visited by the principal
"leaders" of the Gueiquechale, Bobole, Xicocoge,
Obaya, Xiupulame, Manos Prietas, Bacorama,
Omomone, Baniamamar and later by the Mescale,
Jumee, Cabeza, Contotor, Tetecora, Bausari, Manos
Coloradas, Teimamar, and others (Barbarigo
1674a: 112). At least the people from the first set of
groups were interviewed through the interpreters
Don Marcos and Don Lasaro Agustin, who spoke
Castilian, Mexican, and apparently the language of
those groups (Elizondo 1674:69). They declared
their wish to settle, but they were divided in several
groupings at present because of the epidemic and
the lack of food. Fr. Larios stated that they lived on
mescal, tuna, small nuts and oak acorns, fish, buffalo, and deer. Their dwellings were round huts
surrounded by straw and covered with buffalo pelts
that had been prepared so as not to let the water
penetrate (Barbarigo 1674a:l12). Some of their
people were on the Rio Grande, 20 leagues (52
miles) from San Ildefonso, hunting andjerking buffalo meat. Many others were in various spots looking for food while several warriors had been left

33

guarding their belongings at the place where they
had congregated with Fr. Larios (Elizondo 1674:6970). The following day (January 29th) Captain
Elizondo counted the people: there were 543 adult
women and children and 106 warriors. At the Natives' request Fr. Larios baptized 63 Native children.
Captain Elizondo notified Don Marcos and his
allies to gather on the Rio Sabinas in order and that
he would give them possession of the lands they
had selected. Don Marcos made it clear that the
number of his people to be settled far exceeded
those present. He also stated that he needed more
time to gather those who were settled (com mas
gente de la suya de la que esta en aquella parte que
la de demas esta fixos y an menester mas tiempo
para salir a ella) (Elizondo 1674:71). After the
religious ceremonies Elizondo gave the Native Captains their staffs and admonished them to remain
peaceful. He also told them to give of their foods to
the friars because the latter had no Spanish foods
and were eating mescal (y acudiessen a su corriente
con algun sustento de sus comidas par quanta se
allan sin ningun de las de las espanoles comiendo
mescale) (Elizondo 1674:71-72).
Captain Elizondo specified that he had given
possession to the Natives of the lands on both sides
of the Rio Sabinas for a distance of l 0 to 18 leagues
(26 to 46.8 miles) (Elizondo 1674:72). On February l, 1674, Elizondo reported that he had given
possession to Don Marcos and his allies of the
lands along the course of the Sabinas River above
and below a divide between hills that was next to
the river, and beyond and northward of the place
which they call "where the tetecores were killed"
(Elizondol674:74). The lands extended about 8
leagues north-south from the divide and downstream
to a small hill shaped like a hat, which was located
at the crossing of the path that led to the San
Ildefonso settlement. This pueblo, which was 14
leagues (36.4 miles) south of San Ildefonso, was
called Santa Rosa de Santa Maria (Elizondo
1674:74-75). As sign of possession the Natives
pulled grass, dug dirt, watered the earth, and marked
with stones the square area where the church was to
be built.
Captain Elizondo, clearly at the bequest of Fr.
Larios, made several recommendations for the success of the enterprise. First, he asked that no Spaniard be allowed to enter that area, particularly those
from Saltillo and Nuevo Leon, because the Natives

34

Texas Archeological Society

abhorred them due to the punishments and deaths
these people had caused the Natives. Second, he
asked that no Spaniard be allowed to hunt buffalo
in the area. This was a very sensitive issue for the
Natives which, among themselves, led them to defend their rights by the force of arms (por ser materia mui sensible para ellos, y que afuerza de armas
defienden de otras naciones). Third, that no Native
be again subjected to encomienda since the
encomenderos had not reduced them but only exploited them (Elizondo 1674:72-73), and fourth,
that the missionaries needed help with food, seed,
and farming utensils. On March 2, 1674, Fr. Larios
sent a letter and several testimonies of their missionary work to the Commissary General in
Guadalajara. This letter was hand-delivered by Fr.
Pefiasco, who traveld to Guadalajara to request help
for the new conversions in Coahuila (Larios 1674b).
In a letter dated September 15, 1674, Fr. Larios
(Figueroa Torres 1963:67; Larios 1674a:135,
1674c:l45) confirmed that between January and
February 1674, the friars had established two mission settlements (poblaciones): S. Ildefonso de la
Paz, located 14 leagues (36.4 miles) north of the
Rio Sabinas, 20 leagues (52 miles) south of the Rio
Grande and over 70 leagues from Saltillo; and Santa
Rosa de Santa Maria, located 80 leagues (208 miles)
north of Saltillo and 40 leagues westward of the
Rio Grande. The two mission settlements were established principally for the Gueiquezale and the
Bobole, but in them were aggregated 32 different
Native groups. Twenty-two other groups from
Nueva Viscaya and Nueva Galicia had also declared peace and were joining the friars (Larios
1674a:l35). At S. Ildefonso there were 512
Gueiquesale and 178 additional individuals, some
of which were Bobole, Obayo, Tiltique, Tiltiquimayo, Pinanaca, and Mayhuam, among others (de
la Cruz 1674; Steck 1932:6). The smallpox epidemic had led the Gueiquesale, the Bobole, and the
Obayo to ask to leave the area. These groups promised to return by the half-moon of March. Fr. Manuel
de la Cruz remained at Santa Rosa until March 20,
1674, at which time he was joined by Captain Francisco Barbarigo and Fr. Larios, who arrived from
Saltillo with supplies to build the adobe church, the
sacristy, and a zacate dwelling for the friars (de la
Cruz 1674).
The friars stated that the conditions at the mission settlements were very bad: they had little to
eat but mescal and roots, and their tattered robes

would soon force them to wear buffalo and deer
skins (de la Cruz 1674; Steck 1932: 16-17). Captain
Barbarigo stated that the friars sent him donkeys to
be returned with flour and ground corn, but when
the Friars ran out of these foods they ate roots of
lechugilla, tule, and sotol (Barbarigo l 674b;
Figueroa Torres 1963:96). Although it is clear that
the conditions could not have been good, especially
for the Native Americans deeply affected by smallpox, the friars' reports seem to reflect more their
own difficulties than those of the local inhabitants,
particularly because the Native groups actually supplied the friars with food (Elizondo 1674:71-72).
When Fr. Larios arrived at Santa Rosa and
realized that the Bobole had left the settlement, he
asked Fr. Manuel to find them and persuade them
to return to the pueblo. On March 22, 1674, Fr.
Manuel departed Santa Rosa and traveled 12
leagues (31.2 miles) to an arroyo where the Bobole
were camped. Six days later (March 28th?), Fr.
Manuel arrived back at Santa Rosa with the
Bobole. One day after his arrival, Fr. Larios ordered him to the north side of the Rio Grande to
look for the Gueiquesale, and Fr. Manuel left the
following day (30th or 31st of March?) (de la
Cruz 1674:119-120).
On May 29, 1674, Fr. Manuel wrote a letter
describing his trip to the north side of the Rio
Grande. The letter makes it clear that he was reluctant to make the trip (de la Cruz 1674). He left with
five Bobole and traveled northward for four and
one-half days and covered about 40 leagues (104
miles) to reach the Rio Grande. The group crossed
the Rio Grande in two stages. The crossing was
difficult and disturbed the horse or mule Fr. Manuel
was riding. After crossing the Rio Grande, Fr.
Manuel traveled eastward for three days and arrived near a mountain which the Natives called
Dacate, a word that in Castilian meant noses
(camine al salir del sol dejando de ir acia el norte y
a los tres dias llege junta de una sierra q. Los
yndios llamam dacate q. en nuestro edioma es lo
proprio q. narices) (de la Cruz 1674: 120). Near
Dacate Fr. Manuel was intercepted by a Native
who warned him to leave that path because the
Patagua-Ocane and Catujane were coming to aITest
him and kill his companions. These groups had
been told to do so by a devil who appeared to them
in visible form (y me dijo q. dejase aquel camino
porq. los yndios Pataguas-ocanes y catujanes
abisados de un demonio q. se les aparece en forma

Wade bisible). Fr. Manuel changed course toward the
north and hid in an anoyo for three days surviving
on reed roots (y despidiendose de mi bolbi a caminar
acia a el norte y escondido en un aroyo estube tres
dias) (de la Cruz 1674:120). While in hiding he
sent one of his Bobole guides to reconnoiter the
land, and he returned saying that the Bobole who
were missing from Santa Rosa were camped about
6 leagues (15.6 miles) upstream and northward on
the same arroyo.
Pleased with the news, Fr. Manuel left his hiding place at about midnight and arrived at the
Bobole camp around 9:00 AM. The Bobole informed him that the Gueiquesale "leader" was staying, with all his people, 8 leagues (20.8 miles)from
the Bobole camp. Fr. Manuel related to the Bobole
how he had been warned about the hostile attitude
of the Patagua-Ocane and Catujane. The Bobole
appeared to be rather astonished. They immediately
sent scouts to survey the land and Fr. Manuel sent
a Bobole to warn the Gueiquesale "leader" Don
Esteban who, upon learning of their plight, left
camp with such haste that he reached the Bobole
camp before sunset. Don Esteban brought along 98
warriors prepared for war, well supplied with bows
and arrows, and displaying body decoration for
war. They were wearing only a small piece of deer
skin (gamuca) over their sexual organs and a hide
shield (adarga de cuero). Their arms and chests
were decorated with streaks of red, yellow, and
white. On their heads they had crowns made of
mesquite leaves and others of leaves of estofiate
silvestre (a medicinal herb). Above the floral
crowns they wore beautiful feathers. When they
arrived at the Bobole camp they sat down and Fr.
Manuel embraced Don Esteban, who asked Fr.
Manuel why he had come to see them. Fr. Manuel
declared that he had come to look for them and find
out why the Gueiquesale had not returned to Santa
Rosa. Don Esteban declared that his people only
wished to be Christians and that was certainly his
intent. He stated that as long as Fr. Manuel had
come for them they would depart with him (de la
Cruz 1674:121).
Meanwhile, the Natives who had gone to patrol
the land reported that the enemies were still pursuing Fr. Manuel and that they had 180 warriors.
Upon receiving these news they all stood up, got
very excited, and told Fr. Manuel to stay in the
camp (rancho) with the women and children while
they proceeded to meet the enemy. Fr. Manuel re-

35

fused their offer, stating that he would not abandon
his brothers. Considering Fr. Manuel's decision as
proof of his friendship, they declared that they
would rather die than abandon him. Fr. Manuel,
Don Esteban, and 147 bowmen left the Bobole
camp about 10:00 PM and traveled until they detected the enemy. Then they stopped, and at sunrise
they appraised each other's forces. The Gueiquesale
and Bobole warriors recognized the superiority in
numbers of their adversaries. Fr. Manuel showed
them Christ's image (a cross or picture of Christ on
the cross) and told them not to worry because God
would help them. The last thing the warriors did
before battle was to prepare their bows. Then with
a horrible noise they attacked the enemy with great
valor. Unable to resist, the enemy abandoned the
field and hid in the Sierra Dacate. The Gueiquesale
and the Bobole killed seven men and captured four
women and three boys who they did not kill due to
Fr. Manuel's intervention. After their victory the
Bobole and Gueiquesale showed the surrounding
area to Fr. Manuel, telling him the name of the
arroyos, mountains, and hills (y muy alegres me
llebaran por toda aquella tierra ensenandomela y
diciendome los nombres de los arroyos, sierras y
lomas) (de la Cruz 1674:122). They returned to the
Bobole camp and the following day Fr. Manuel left
with the Bobole to join with the Gueiquesale
rancheria. They traveled two days through beautiful prairies (caminando dos dias por unas ermosas
lanadas) (de la Cruz 1674:122). The prairies they
traversed, as well as all the land Fr. Manuel had
traveled through after crossing to the north side of
the Rio Grande, were covered with countless buffalo, and had many fish, shrimp, plenty of turtles,
and all the richness one could ask for (de la Cruz
1674:122).
Fr. Manuel was well received at the Gueiquesale rancheria. The Gueiquesale women put on a
dance, as was their custom, to express their pleasure at his visit. The following day they all departed. They were 733 people counting children
and adults. Fr. Manuel stated that he had spent 21
days north of the Rio Grande. Together they reached
the Rio Grande, which they crossed in two stages at
a wide and beautiful crossing. The river water
reached only the belly of the animal he was riding.
This crossing had in the middle of the river a sandy
island with two beautiful beaches on both sides of
the island. There were rocks but the rocks were not
good to make fire (de la Cruz 1674:122).

36

After crossing the Rio Grande, they traveled
for two days and reached an arroyo where 166
Pinanaca and Tiltiq.mayas were camped. They welcomed him and the women prepared a feast (dance?)
in his honor. The following day they continued
their journey, and traveled seven days through beautiful lands and arroyos until they reached the Nueces
River (Mexico). Fr. Manuel explained that the river
was so named because all the trees produced large
nuts in great quantities. After crossing the Nueces
River, they traveled for one day and reached a
spring located in a marsh between some hills. Here
they found 82 Babusarigame who also received
him well. The following day they all departed for
Santa Rosa. Both male and female children ran
ahead of him gathering small bead-like fruits which
grew in the thick bushes. With great joy they
brought them to the friar, saying in their language
"here father these are for you to eat" (de la Cruz
1674:123). Fr. Manuel accepted them and thanked
God for his good fortune. After crossing several
beautiful and wide plains and many pleasant arroyos the group reached an arroyo located about l 0
leagues (26 miles) from Santa Rosa. The Native
travelers were tired and asked to remain there to
rest two or three days. Fr. Manuel went ahead to
Santa Rosa where he found Fr. Larios and Captain
Barbarigo. The day after Fr. Manuel's arrival, they
finished erecting an adobe church with a sacristy
and a zacate dwelling for the friars. On that same
day, Fr. Pefiasco arrived from Guadalajara having
tried, unsuccessfully, to see his Franciscan superiors and obtain support for the mission settlements.
Three days after his arrival, Fr. Manuel accompanied Barbarigo to Saltillo to request food donations. Captain Barbarigo, personally aware of the
difficulties the friars were experiencing, gave Fr.
Manuel flour and corn. After two days in Saltillo,
Fr. Manuel returned to the Pueblo with the much
needed food supplies (de la Cruz 1674:123).
Fr. Manuel closed his letter with an appeal to
his Franciscan superiors for help with supplies as
well as a vehement request for action against the
encomenderos who would not set the Natives free
to go settle their lands. Fr. Manuel reported an
incident that had just taken place: two male and
two female Natives had left the Hacienda de Patos,
whose owner was Don Agustin Eceberz y Subica.
Upon learning of their departure, Don Agustin sent
three people in their pursuit. These individuals
hunted down the Natives as if they were runaway

slaves (coma se fueran esclavos fugitivos). Fr.
Manuel concluded by saying that if the actions of
the encomenderos were not curbed all their work
among the Native populations would be lost (de la
Cruz 1674:124).
In July, Fr. Pefiasco wrote to his superiors from
Saltillo to relate the events that occurred during
May and June. From Fr. Pefiasco' s letter, it appears
he had left Guadalajara on April 10th and arrived at
Santa Rosa May 10, 1674 (Barbarigo 1674b:130).
Eight days after his arrival at Santa Rosa (May
18th), Fr. Larios sent him to look for the Manos
Prietas (Pefiasco 1674: 127). Fr. Pefiasco found them
4 leagues (10.4 miles) north of the Rio Grande and
about 50 leagues (130 miles) from Santa Rosa. The
Manos Prietas offered him buffalo meat which they
possessed in quantity. Fr. Pefiasco asked them to
move closer to Santa Rosa in order that he could
catechize them, and they replied they would do so
in another eight days (Pefiasco 1674:127).
Meanwhile, the Manos Prietas told Fr. Pefiasco
about another group, the Giorica, who lived further
inland (mas adentro) 8 leagues (20.8 miles). Fr.
Pefiasco dispatched two ambassadors (dos
embaxadores) to the Giorica to inform them of his
presence. The Giorica replied that they did not want
to leave their land because they were doing very
well and had plenty of food and supplies where
they lived (q. no querian salir a parte alguna por
allarse mui bien en aquella tierra, adonde no les
faltaba la comida, y sustento necesario) (Pefiasco
1674: 127). Undaunted, Fr. Pefiasco dispatched another ambassador to explain that he was not trying
to persuade them to leave their land but to teach
them about God. Fr. Pefiasco added that if his words
made sense to them they should come and embrace
God, otherwise they should stay where they were in
peace since God did not force people to serve him.
The Giorica treated the second ambassador with
more affection than they had the first ones and gave
him a Quezale boy who was their prisoner. They
also told the ambassador that in two days time they
would come to see Fr. Pefiasco, which they did
(Pefiasco 1674:127).
The Manos Prietas, their bodies festively decorated, met the Giorica on the way. Later they held a
dance for the Giorica as a sign of peace and exchanged bows and arrows to solidify the peace commitment (una danza, o baile, q. es seftal de paz, y
trocaron unos con otros areas y flechas para maior
firmeza de la paz) (Pefiasco 1674:127-128). The

Wadefollowing day Fr. Pefiasco told them that God and
the King wished them to be peaceful and to settle.
For that purpose the King would give them corn to
plant and oxen to sustain themselves. He stated
that the friars were sent by God and the King to
teach them the Christian doctrine and to defend
them against the Spaniards, who the Natives intensely disliked because of the news they were
receiving of the tyrannical behavior suffered by
those closer to the Spaniards [defenderlos de los
espaiioles (aquien tienen notable aborrecimiento,
por las noticias que les dan de las tiranias que
usan con los de la tierra afuera)] (Pe.fiasco
1674:127, parenthesis in the original).
Persuaded by Fr. Pe.fiasco's words, about 300
Giorica departed with him and the Manos Prietas
for Santa Rosa. About 70 Giorica remained behind
to care for their sick people with the understanding
that as soon as they recovered they would join their
people at Santa Rosa (Pe.fiasco 1674:128). Fr.
Pe.fiasco also stated that at Santa Rosa the friars had
gathered about 3,200 people who were settled in
radii of2, 3, 5, and? leagues (5.2, 7.8, 13, and 18.2
miles). At the time they were sustaining themselves
from the large, productive tuna fields in the area,
but as Fr. Pefiasco pointed out, if the friars did not
get food before the tuna supplies ran out, all the
natives would leave in search of food. They would
then tell the friars they had wronged them by convincing them to gather at Santa Rosa and promising
food without delivering (Pefiasco 1674:128).
Also in July Captain Barbarigo wrote a letter to
the Franciscan Commissary that confirmed the problems facing the fathers at Santa Rosa. Barbarigo,
who had returned to Saltillo with Fr. Manuel on
May 22, 1674, stated that the friars needed three
more religious workers to be able to handle so
many people, particularly because they could not
remain together due to the lack of food. The friars
were obliged to follow the Natives, and they moved
every three or four days to look for food. They
would set up a rancheria, but when there were no
more roots to be had hunger forced then to move
again. For this reason the friars often stayed apart
20 to 30 leagues (52 to 78 miles). Barbarigo also
stated that the encomenderos were continuing the
practice of enslaving the natives (Barbarigo
1674b:133).
In September 1674, Fr. Larios was planning to
establish four other settlements to accommodate
the large number of people who had expressed a

Native American

Hi<!tnnâ¢

37

wish to settle. These settlements were to be located
in Mapimi, San Lorenzo, San Pedro, and Cuatro
Cienegas. The families who were going to occupy
these settlements were to move into those areas by
November 1674 (Larios 1674a: 138). Given this program, he was understandably desperate for funds,
food, and other supplies. Fr. Larios was aware that
Don Antonio de Balcarcel had been appointed
Alcalde Mayor of Coahuila, and it appears Fr. Larios
wanted to have these settlements in place before
Balcarcel took office.
On October 31, 1674, Fr. Dionisio de San
Buenaventura reported to his superiors. He stated
that he had arrived at Santa Rosa in early August
1674, accompanied by Fr. Esteban Martinez.When
they reached Santa Rosa the place had been abandoned and destroyed. About 600 Natives had moved
15 leagues (39 miles) further inland. The two friars
joined them while awaiting Fr. Larios, who had
gone to see the Governor of Parral to request the
release of the men, women, and children the Governor had imprisoned in December 1673 (de San
Buenaventura 1674:141; Larios 1674a, 1674c:l43).
Fr. Dionisio reported that Balcarcel was to take
office in November. The friars were so apprehensive about the Native reaction to this new official
entrada in Coahuila that they all gathered in Saltillo
to see what developed and also to ask for food
donations (limosna) (de San Buenaventura
1674:142).
On December 30, 1674, Fr. Larios reported to
his Franciscan superiors and provided them with a
Memoria (Larios 1674d) of the groups who had
pledged obedience as of that date. His letter recapitulates some of the events of the year that was
about to close. Fr. Larios reported on the unhappy
events at Santa Rosa, where only Don Esteban, the
Gueiquezal, and Don Marcos, the Babane, had remained. Don Esteban was very sick and it appeared
that Don Marcos and some of his people, mostly
ladinos, had taken all the things from the sacristy
and set fire to the jacale of the friars (Larios
1674c:144-145).
Fr. Larios went on to explain why Native groups
moved so frequently and why the friars were compelled to follow them. He stated that because they
were very numerous and lived on the roots gathered and on the animals hunted, in about 15 days
they depleted the area where they camped, and
were forced to move to other areas. Thus, the friars
could not erect permanent buildings and stay with

38

Texas Archeological Society

the Native groups in one place. They were like
gypsies who did not have permanently located
dwellings (en quince dias atalan la tierra donde se
hallan de rayces y luego les es fuerr;a levantar su
rancheria y andarse a otro paraje, y desta suerte
no nos es possible hacer mansion en parte alguna
con ellos, porque son como gitanos q. no tienen
vivienda situada) (Larios 1674c:144).
In his Memoria (Larios 1674d) Fr. Larios listed
the coalitions, their "leaders," and the Native member groups of each coalition. The Bobole coalition,
under Captain Joan de la Cruz, included the Bobole
proper and the Xicocosse, Jumane, Bauane
(Babane), Xupulame, Yorica, Xianco cadam,
Yergiba, and Bacaranan (Larios 1674d). Although
there is no later list for the Bobole coalition, the
Bagname, Bibit, Geniocane, Gicocoge, Jumee, and
Yorica are mentioned as allies of the Bobole in
1675 (Portillo 1984: 106).
The Gueiquesale coalition, under Don Esteban,
included the Hueyquetzale proper and the Manos
Prietas, Bacoram, Pinanacam, Cacaxte, Coniane,
Ovaya, Tetecora, Contotore, Tocaymamare, Saesser,
Teneymamar, Codarn (Oodam?), Guiguigoa,
Eguapit, Tocamomom, Huhuygam, Doaquioydacam, Cocuytzam, Aquita doydacam, Babury,
Dedepo, Soromet, and Teymamare (Larios 1674c).
The third coalition was under Don Fabian and
included the Mayo, Babusarigame, Bamarimamare,
Cabezas, Bauiasmamare, Colorado, Pies de
Venado, Igo quib, and Toque (Larios 1674d). The
elements of this coalition also acknowledged the
authority of Don Esteban. The fourth and last coalition group was under the influence of Captain
Miguel, a Catujano, and included the Catujano
proper, the Bahanero, Chacahuale, Toarma,
Masiabe, Madmeda, Mabibit, Milihae, Ape,
Pa9haque, Tilyhay, Xumez, Garafe, and Mexcale
(Larios 1674d).
Fr. Larios' lists, as published by Alessio Robles (1938:232, 242) and Griffen (1969:88), differ
from the original in that some Native names are
shown with a different spelling and the Xumez
are omitted from the Catujano list. From the
events of 1658 and 1673, it is clear that these
groups stated their allegiance to Fr. Larios and
had established these coalitions sometime before
the arrival of Balcarcel.
On November 23, 1674, Don Antonio Balcarcel
arrived at Monclova. On November 28th, Fr. Larios
and Fr. Manuel went in search of the Bobole and

their allies at the Sabinas River. Fr. Larios stated
that in February he would be traveling north of the
Rio Grande to visit Don Esteban, who was there
with all his people. He was also sending another
friar to the Catujano, not only to continue to catechize them, but also to make arrangements for
Bakarel' s trip to the north side of the Rio Grande
to survey the land and count the Natives (Larios
1674c:l49).
As soon as Balcarcel took possession of
Monclova, he received a series of Native ambassadorial delegations who came to pledge obedience
and declare their intent to be peaceful and settle in
pueblos. Fr. Larios' lists include groups that did not
appear before Balcarcel to pay homage, and were
not included in the lists given by Juan de la Cruz,
Don Esteban, or Captain Miguel. Don Fabian does
not appear as the spokesman for a coalition in the
later lists. Don Esteban came in the name of his
group and as representative of the following groups:
Manos Prietas, Bocora, Siaexer, Pinanaca,
Escabaca, Cacaste, Cocobipta, Cocomaque,
Oodame, Contotore, Colorado, Babiamare, and
Taimamare (Portillo 1984:69). Captain Miguel, a
Christian Catujano, appeared on behalf of his group
and as representative of his allies the Tilijae, Ape,
Jumee, Pachuque, and Toamare (Portillo 1984:72).
Later, Captain Miguel brought before Balcarcel the
captains of the Bajare, Pachaque, and Jumee
(Portillo 1984:80-83).
On January 18th, Balcarcel welcomed Francisco, a Bagname, who was accompanied by 18
warriors, three women, Mapo, a Bagname Captain,
and Yosame carboan, a Siano Captain (Portillo
1984:73-75). On January 26, 1675, Balcarcel received the visit of Pablo, a Manos Prietas, who was
accompanied by eight individuals of his group, the
Gueiquesale, BapacoraPinanaca (Bacopora and
Pinanaca), and Espopolame (Portillo 1984:73-75).
On April 22, 1675, Balcarcel received Don Salvador, a Bobosarigame, who came accompanied by
Don Bernabe, a Contotore, and by Don Esteban,
who was, by then, called Capitan Grande by the
other Natives (Portillo 1984:80-83).
This series of ambassadorial delegations provides some information about Native power relationships and the various coalitions and their
member-groups. The order of appearance before
Balcarcel is the following: the Gueiquesale and their
allies; the Catujano and their allies; the Contotore;
the Bagname and the Siano; and the Manos Prietas,

Wade who came as allies of the Gueiquesale and with two
groups allied with the Gueiquesale (the Bacora and
Pinanaca). The Manos Prietas also brought along
the Espopolame, not mentioned in the coalition list
of Don Esteban but recorded as Xupulame, a member of the Bobole coalition, in December 1674. The
Manos Prietas had alliances, or friendship ties, with
groups belonging to the Gueiquesale and the Bobole
macro-spheres of influence. This indicates a primary alliance (micro-social) with the Xupulame
(and probably other groups), and an alliance with
the Bobole at a macro-social level. The Manos
Prietas alliance with the Gueiquesale may have also
been a primary alliance. The same holds true for
the alliance between the Bacora and Pinanaca (micro-social) and the alliance between the Bacora, the
Pinanaca, and the Gueiquesale (macro-social).
These alliances were, quite possibly, restricted to
certain spheres of social and economic interaction.
The next round of ambassadorial delegations
started with the Catujano and their allies, the
Bobosarigame (who came accompanied by Don
Esteban and Don Bernabe, a Contotore ), followed
once again by the Catujano and their allies. Don
Bernabe appeared to be an adjunct to Don Esteban,
a Gueiquesale. The Bobosarigame, who in December 1674 appeared within the following of Don
Fabian, accepted Don Esteban's authority quite
likely via the Contotore. This implies a closer relationship (micro-social) with the Contotore. In their
visits to Balcarcel, the Catujano representatives were
never accompanied by the Gueiquesale or the
Bobole. This confirms their independence, as a coalition, from the other two coalitions.
The Catujano brought before Balcarcel the Captains of the Ape, Tilijae, Bajare, Jumee, and
Pachaque. Only the representative of the Toamare,
stated as a Catujano ally in January, did not come
before Balcarcel. The Bagname and the Siano asked
to be settled with the Bobole. They do not appear to
have considered the Gueiquesale their friends or to
have had an alliance with them. Their relationship to
the Catujano, if there was one, could have been via
their connection to the Bobole. Being inhabitants of
the Dacate area, as they stated, they were probably
being squeezed by the peoples of Don Esteban's
coalition, as indicated by the statements made by
the peoples encountered by Bosque while on the
north side of the Rio Grande. Some of the Catujano
groups (Ape, Jumee, and Bibit or Mabibit) seem to
have had a closer relationship with the Bobole,

likely via the Yorica. This series of interlocking
ties within micro- or macro-coalitions reflects the
particular and timely concerns of each group.
The process of aggregation through coalitions
and alliances is well noted among the Prehispanic
Tlascaltecans (Corona 1988:66-69). Although in the
Tlascaltecan case Corona refers to "clans" and
"tribes," he points out that the political structure
was organized around an individual who was viewed
as the supreme expression of the community and
was the eldest or the strongest in political and military terms. This individual would establish close
relations with other "chiefs" of the same ethnic
group or, alternatively, establish alliances to achieve
a broad coalition to defend the ethnic and territorial
viability of the group (Corona 1988:68).
Similar processes were at work in Pre-contact
California. Discussing issues of multi-lingualism,
Silver and Miller (1997:212-215) state:
[T]ribelets were strongly connected with
each other by both formal and informal
interlocking links, and stable trade and
military alliances often involved communities that were members of various
language groups. Alliance structures occurred throughout the precontact California area from west to east and from
north to south. In addition, there were
communities that served as cross-tribelet
interface centers, sometimes involving
several hundred to several thousand
people in intense sociopolitical and economic interaction (Silver and Miller
1997:214).

Unfortunately, these authors provide only general
sources (Silver and Miller 1997:223) to substantiate these comments, making it difficult to compare
specific groups and cases.
In April 1675, Don Esteban reported having
problems with the Ervipiame (Yrvipias) because
they had killed five people belonging to the
Gueiquesale coalition. In retaliation for that attack,
the Gueiquesale attacked the Ervipiame and killed
their Captain and eight of his people. The sequence
of conflicts between the Gueiquesale (and their
allies) with the Ervipiame shows a continuation of
a problem that already existed the year before, when
Fr. Manuel witnessed a battle between these groups
(Portillo 1984:75, 80-81; Wade 1998:50-51).
Whatever the problems at issue, they had not been

40

Texas Archeological Society

resolved. If the Ervipiame were trying to infringe
on the territory held by the Gueiquesale and their
allies, they had not yet succeeded. If, on the other
hand, the situation was reversed, the Gueiquesale
had not succeeded in displacing the Ervipiame. It
appears, however, that the Gueiquesale were
getting the upper hand. Regardless of the final
outcome of the conflict, smaller and weaker groups
in the area would have to ally themselves with one
of these parties.
It is logical to think that the number of warriors
was a very important consideration for Native
groups and that having 100 warriors or more was
necessary to muster control. It is possible that the
threshold was regarded as controlling 100 bowmen. Thus, some battles were waged to reduce the
size of the opposing warrior group, because warriors were not easily replaced. Likewise, coalitions
were necessary to provide warriors and maintain a
balance of power.
On April 25, 1675, the Parochial Church of
Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe was officially opened.
The following day Balcarcel founded the Native
pueblo of S. Miguel de Luna. The pueblo leadership was given to the Bobole and the Gicocoge,
even though other groups, including the Ape and
the Gueiquesale, were congregated there (Portillo
1984:84-87). On April 29, 1675, Captain Pablo, a
Manos Prietas, arrived to settle at S. Miguel de
Luna with 232 of his people. He informed Balcarcel
that he had left behind, ready to depart, all the
people who wanted to be settled. The number of
people was so great that they extended from
Monclova to both the south and the north banks of
the Rio Grande (Portillo 1984:88). Balcarcel must
have been petrified. S. Miguel de Luna was already
overflowing, and even charismatic leaders like Juan
de la Cruz and Don Esteban were hard pressed to
maintain peace. The alliance between the Bobole,
the Gueiquesale, and the Spaniards held the balance of power and was key to the peace that kept
other groups at bay. On the other hand, many Spaniards, fearful of the presence of so many Native
Americans, had fled the area (Portillo 1984:132).
Balcarcel readily recognized the potential for conflict if all these peoples were allowed to stay at S.
Miguel de Luna.
On April 30th, Balcarcel ordered Alferez
Fernando del Bosque and Fr. Juan Larios to travel
from the Rio de Nadadores to the Sierra Dacate
and other areas that might be convenient to visit.

They were to take possession of the lands, record
information on the environment, and count the
peoples they encountered. They were to inform the
Native Americans that the Spanish would establish
pueblos for them and would supply ministers to
teach them the Christian doctrine. In fact, however,
their primary objective was to stem the flow of
Native groups into the Monclova area by promising
them the establishment of pueblos in their own
lands (Portillo 1984:88-89).

THE BOSQUE-LARIOS
EXPEDITION
The expedition of Fernando del Bosque and Fr.
Larios (Portillo 1984:90-107; Wade 1998:63-106)
to the north side of the Rio Grande was fairly uneventful. The group left Monclova and traveled to
the Rio Grande, which they crossed near modem
Normandy, Texas (Figure 1). Soon after the crossing, probably at Las Moras Creek (day 14), they
encountered 54 Yorica and Jeapa warriors who had
been buffalo hunting. These individuals complained
to Bosque about their difficulties in traversing the
land, visiting their kinfolk, and acquiring resources.
They also reported their conflicts with the Ocane,
the Pataguaque, and the Ervipiame. The Yorica and
Jeapa offered to guide the expeditionary group to
the peoples who lived in the Sierra Dacate and
Yacatsol. Meanwhile they sent emissaries to their
people, the Mabibit (or Bibit) and the Jumee, to
join them along the way to greet the Spaniards. On
May 14th, probably between Las Moras Creek and
Cow Creek, the Bosque-Larios party met the
Mabibit and the Jumee, who reiterated the same
complaints made by the Yorica and Jeapa. These
people were separated from their kin due to
internecine strife between Native groups. Such a
pattern of forced geographical division of ethnic
groups in the Edwards Plateau occurred prior to the
southward moves of the Apache. The statements of
the Mabibit, Jeapa, Jumee, and Yorica constitute
good evidence that the same or related Native
groups lived in different areas, either by choice or
as a result of local conflicts.
While at this camp, Bosque and Larios received
the visit of six captains of the Pinanaca, Xaeser,
Teneimamar, and possibly the Cocoma. They had
come to reaffirm the allegiance given to the King
of Spain, in their name, by Don Esteban. They were

waiting to become Christians and be settled in a
pueblo (Bolton 1916:300-301; Portillo 1984:97-98).
The visit of the Pinanaca, Xaeser, and Teneimamar
captains confirms the connections between the following of Don Esteban on the west and those on
the east (i.e., the north bank of the Rio Grande). All
these groups were included in the coalition of Don
Esteban. None of these groups complained about
the difficulties of traveling through the area or having access to the buffalo herds. Their silence over
these difficulties appears to be confirmation of their
control over the area as members of the Gueiquesale
coalition. This control would justify the problems
of the Yorica, Bibit, Jeapa, and Jumee to travel
through the area, since these groups were members
of the Bobole and the Catujano-Tilijae coalitions.
The following day, probably on Elm Creek, the
Spaniards were visited by the captains of the
Xoman, Tereodan, Teaname, and Teimamar, together with their people (Bolton 1916:300-301;
Portillo 1984:98). They too declared their wish to
be Christians and settle in pueblos. This decision
was being taken for the future welfare of their children and grand-children. Bosque ordered them to
be peaceful and to avoid the conflicts that led them
to kill each other. The people of these groups made
an offering (lismona) of a piece of animal fat (sebo ),
a piece of rendered fat (manteca), as well as skins
or pelts of animals that they used to make clothing,
or used as cover for themselves, or to sleep on
(Portillo 1984:98-99). When the Spaniards counted
the Natives they found over 1,300 people.
On May 18th, the party reached a small stream
that the Natives called Dacate. It appears that the
native word Dacate denoted the southwest edge of
the Edwards Plateau. On the southwest bank of the
West Nueces River, Bosque received the visit of a
Geniocane Captain who stated that he could not travel
further south because of their enemies, but that his
people would be waiting for the Spaniards northward. The Geniocane could not travel to the area of
Dacate, the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau.
The control of the boundaries of that physiographic
feature prevented the Geniocane from reaching the
buffalo hunting grounds on the plains to the south.
The Bagname captains Francisco and Mapo, as
well as the Siano (Sana) Captain Yosame carboan,
who visited Balcarcel at Monclova, declared that
they came from a mountain range (sierra) which in
their language was called Dacate. These groups
were not mentioned among the following of Don

Esteban (Portillo 1984:74-73). Presumably the
Bagname and the Siano were in the same situation
as the Geniocane, sandwiched between the friends
of the Gueiquesale and other enemies further to
the north on the plains forming the top of the
Edwards Plateau.
On May 20th, the Bosque-Larios party reached
the rancheria of the Geniocane, probably in the
valley of Indian Creek (see Figure 1). Unlike other
groups met before, it is apparent that Fr. Larios was
not acquainted with the Geniocane since he did not
accede to their request for baptism. However, he
promised to visit them frequently and teach them
the doctrine in order that they could be baptized
(Wade 1998:94-95).
On May 25th, Bosque traveled northward, probably to the headwaters of the more southerly Dry
Devils River. This spot was near or at the locality
mentioned by the Native Americans as Yacatsol
because of the small mountains with tall protrusions like nipples described by Bosque (Lino
Canedo 1968:8; Molina 1977:30; Wade 1998:9798). He was accompanied by the captains of the
Xoman, Tereodan, Teaname, and Teimamar. He
ordered them to remain peaceful in their lands.
Bosque stated that these groups belonged to the
following of Don Esteban.
The Bosque-Larios party returned to Monclova.
North of the Rio Grande between Sycamore Creek
and Pinto Creek (see Figure 1), Bosque met the
Bobole, who were hunting buffalo. During the return trip Bosque found several other Native groups
between the south bank of the Rio Grande and
Monclova. Bosque arrived at Monclova and wrote
a report and recommendations to Bakarcel based
on his observations and impressions. Bosque stated
(Portillo 1984: 105-107) that he had traveled the
land north-south and east-west and realized that it
was divided into three major coalitions, or three
divisions (sequitos o parcialidades de jente), each
with a great number of people. The most bellicose,
but the least numerous, was the following of Don
Esteban, consisting of all the peoples that had been
counted, except the Yorica, Jumee, Vivit (Bibit),
and Geniocane, since those groups belonged to the
followings of the Bobole and the Catujano-Tilijae.
These groups had many conflicts among themselves.
They killed each other, ate each other, and kidnapped each other's children, as they themselves
stated. At the time of the report several groups were
at war. The following of Don Esteban was at war

Wade- Unfolding Native American History
with the Geniocane and their allies; the Yorica,
Jumee, and Vivit were at war with the Arame and
the Ocane and those of their following; and the
Bobole were at war with the Yurbipiame. Bosque
declared that the various groups wanted to be Christians and to settle in pueblos, but they wished to get
individual economic and spiritual help and did not
want to be placed together in a pueblo because this
would result in conflicts. He thought the best solution would be to create three main pueblos for the
three coalitions, whereby they would recognize each
other but would remain independent. Apart from
all this, Bosque stated that missionaries would also
have to be provided because the Native Americans
requested them. The groups did not want to share
the friars but wished to be ministered to individually. Besides, the Native peoples spoke different
languages, were very numerous, and their settlements were located at great distances. For the time
being, at least four missionaries were needed for
each chain of settlements, and if the King wished to
accept their request and place them in pueblos, it
would be necessary to provide seed, oxen, and
Tlascaltecan families to help with the settlement
(Portillo 1984: 105-107).

AFTERMATH
On June 30th, Balcarcel and Fr. Larios presided
over the religious ceremonies at S. Miguel de Luna.
By July 3, 1675, Balcarcel realized that there were
too many conflicts and too many people at S. Miguel
de Luna. He ordered the Ape, the Bobosarigame,
the Catujano, and the Manos Prietas to leave the
pueblo for their own lands. He promised them religious and material support (Portillo 1984:127-128).
On July 5th, Larios traveled to Guadalajara to ask
for help for the new conversions in Coahuila. Fr.
Larios also stated that he was in possession of the
Baptism, Marriage, and Burial books that pertained
to the three parcialidades: Boboles, Huiquesales,
and Catuxames and all their allies (Larios 1675).
On July 6, 1675, Balcarcel (Portillo 1984:129-136;
Wade 1998:405-408) wrote a very eloquent and
unusual letter to the Audiencia de Guadalajara. In
it he recommended the establishment of several
pueblos, made suggestions for their organization,
recognized the shortcomings of S. Miguel de Luna,
the inadequacy of the resources available, and the
failure of promises made to the Natives.

43

On October 26, 1675, Balcarcel was visited by
Captain Christobal, a Catujano representative of
the following nations: Ocane, Maquimixe,
Mancequan, Papuliquier, Paponaca, Pahaque,
Patoloque, Mesquite, Pataquaque, Canoome,
Pausale, Pamafeo, Papanaque, Chanoada, Panaque,
Tochi, and Michi. The Catujano Captain estimated
the total population of these groups to be over 2,000
people. Christobal declared that they wished to settle
in pueblos and become Christians. Balcarcel told
them to return to their lands and stated that he
would inform the King of their wishes (Portillo
1984:139). On November 17, 1675, Balcarcel welcomed Juan de la Cruz and Don Esteban, who came
to see him on behalf of their people and the other
groups staying at S. Miguel de Luna. These Native
"leaders" were preoccupied with the continuous
conflicts and the poor conditions in the pueblo, as
well as the misunderstandings that resulted from
the different languages and the actions of manipulative interpreters (Portillo 1984:140).
On November 20, 1675, Balcarcel stated his
intention to visit the surrounding area, assess its
problems, and attempt to keep the peace. He informed Juan de la Cruz and Don Esteban of his
intentions. It is not certain that this trip was ever
undertaken. On the same date, he counted the
people in the town of Monclova and stated that
there were eight Spaniards and 232 Natives. The
rest of the people had left to hunt and eat buffalo.
Thus, most of the people at Monclova were on
their winter buffalo hunt on the north side of the
Rio Grande. By the end of 1676, Balcarcel had
left Monclova and was living in Saltillo (Portillo
1984: 142).
In January 1676, the Bishop of Guadalajara, D.
Manuel de Santa Cruz y Sahagun, placed Fr.
Pefiasco in charge of the pueblo of Santa Rosa (40
leagues from Monclova); Fr. Esteban Martinez in
charge of the pueblo de Baluartes (20 leagues from
Monclova); Fr. Dionisio de Buenaventura in charge
of the pueblo of Quatro Sienegas (16 leagues from
Monclova); and Fr. Manuel de la Cruz at the Head
Mission in Monclova (Cavesera de Coahuila).
These were all Native pueblos (Figueroa Torres
1963:128-129). Fr. Larios died September 7, 1676
(Figueroa Torres 1963:133). In 1681, Fr. Pefiasco
was still working in the area, and during the same
year Fernando del Bosque was appointed Alcalde
Mayor and Capitan de Guerra of Coahuila
(Marques de la Laguna 1681).

Texas Archeological Society
ANALYSIS
Requests fo:r settlement

The events that began to unfold in 1658 and
continued through 1675 make it abundantly clear
that certain Native groups and particular individuals took the initiative to promote the idea of autonomous and multi-ethnic settlements in order to
escape the actions of encomenderos and counteract
the population erosion being experienced by certain ethnic groups. The active intervention of Don
Lazaro Agustin and Don Marcos, as well as the
statements of the Bobole mentioned earlier, are
clear evidence of those concerns. The political
and economic influence of the encomenderos nullified the Natives' demands for settlement until
the intervention of the friars and some influential
civilians took up the Natives' cause. The advocacy of the Natives' requests came with a price:
Christianization practices and the reoccupation of
Monclova by Europeans. This, as usual, would
prove a mixed blessing.

The Franciscan friars, the Natives,
and the Settlement project
With the concerted intervention of Fr. Larios
and the ecclesiastic and civil authorities of
Guadalajara, the establishment of several Native
settlements was attempted in 1674. In their conversion zeal the friars tried to bring into the settlements not only Native groups who actually had
asked for them, but also other groups who apparently expressed no desire to move out of their lands.
The case of the Y orica illustrates this, since the
Yorica specifically stated they did not wish to move,
were content in the lands they occupied, and had
plenty of resources.
Despite the Yorica's early refusal, Fr. Pefiasco
offered them, in the name of God and King, corn
to plant and cattle to eat. This offer led the Yorica
to move from the north side of the Rio Grande to
the south side in May 1674. One year later, in
May 167 5, when the Y orica and their allies, the
Jeapa, Jumee, and Mabibit, were encountered by
Bosque, they complained about the difficulty to
travel freely, obtain food resources, and visit their
kin. It appears that the move they made in 1674
cut them off from their kin and produced loss of
territory and resources. The case of the Y orica is
probably not unique.

Thus, it seems that while some Native groups
needed to move and coalesce with other groups to
maintain their ethnic viability and escape the
encomenderos, other groups were enticed to move
off their lands by well-intentioned but unrealistic
promises. It is clear that the first set of groups was
comprised of Natives who were in close contact
with the European population south and west of the
Rio Grande. The latter set of groups was located
primarily north of the Rio Grande.
The confines of this article do not permit a full
discussion of the settlement problem. However, it
should be noted that the settlement movement of
1674 and 1675 was greatly based on both mutual
equivocations and unreasonable expectations on the
part of the Native groups and the friars. The friars
were befuddled by the intrinsic logic behind the
pattern of resource acquisition practiced by the Native groups, but they could not supply them with
enough food to prevent their frequent moves. On
the other hand, the Natives felt betrayed when they
were promised food resources that were not delivered. When that happened and the local resources
became exhausted, they were forced to move. This
issue was only partly solved when the mission became synonymous with a set of permanent buildings inside which the Natives were confined.

The entrada of Fr. Manuel de la Cruz
The route and events of Fr. Manuel's trip to
Texas have been improperly understood partly because they were reported without adequate context,
and in some cases, erroneously. As previously noted,
it is necessary to review the events of 1658 and
1673 to understand why Fr. Manuel was ordered to
travel north of the Rio Grande.
When Steck (1932) reported on Fr. Manuel's
trip, he omitted some important information included in the letter and mislead researchers by indicating that Fr. Manuel traveled in a "northerly
direction" (Steck 1932: 10) before and after he
crossed the Rio Grande to the north side. Steck also
stated that Fr. Manuel covered "approximately six
leagues a day" (Steck 1932: 10), and that Fr. Manuel
"disregarded the Indian's warning" (Steck 1932: 10)
to change course. All these statements are incorrect. The letter referenced by Steck (1932: 10) has
the same date and addressee as the one I translated,
and most of the information reported by Steck
(1932) is indeed mentioned in the letter. It seems

Wade- Unfolding Native American History
that both Steck (1932) and I saw and used the same
archival document. However, it is possible that
Steck saw an incomplete or faulty transcript of the
letter. Nonetheless, researchers who used this material were mislead just as I was while preparing
my dissertation (Wade 1998). When I finally located these documents and translated them, the discrepancies became apparent.
Fr. Manuel's route as presented in this paper
(see Figure 1) is not without problems. Fr. Manuel
crossed the Rio Grande and traveled eastward for
three days. Late on the third day, near a sierra
called Dacate, he was intercepted by a Native who
warned him not to continue eastward because of
the danger of being captured by hostile Native warriors. Fr. Manuel turned northward and hid in an
arroyo until his scouts reported that the Bobole
were upstream on that same arroyo. He traveled to
the Bobole camp and was soon joined by the
Gueiquesale warriors. Together they traveled to the
site of the battle, which was near the Bobole camp,
and the Bobole and Gueiquesale defeated the enemy. Sometime after the battle, Fr. Manuel traveled two days across beautiful prairies to reach the
Gueiquesale rancheria, and the following day he,
the Bobole, and the Gueiquesale started their return
to Santa Rosa.
The information provided by Fr. Manuel is not
adequate to accurately trace his route north of the
Rio Grande; thus, several alternate scenarios could
be proposed. The one offered here seems to accommodate all the available evidence in a reasonable
manner (see Figure 1). Fr. Manuel crossed the Rio
Grande about 15 miles downriver from Ciudad
Acuna and somewhere between the mouth of Sycamore Creek and Pinto Creek. He traveled three
days in an east-southeast direction. On the first
night Fr. Manuel stopped on Las Moras Creek,
about 13 miles downstream from Brackettville. On
the second night, he stopped at a pond on Stricklin
Creek about 2.5 miles south of the north line of
Maverick County. On the third night Fr. Manuel
hid on Turkey Creek, about one mile south of the
north line of Maverick County, and about two miles
north of the eastward path he had been following.
He proceeded 15.5 miles upstream on Turkey Creek
to the Bobole camp, which was located one and a
half miles northwest of the modem village of Cline.
The battle took place 5 to 10 miles east-northeast of
the Bobole camp, near the confluence of the Nueces
and West Nueces rivers. Fr. Manuel probably spent

45

a few days near the Bobole camp and was shown a
large area of the Edwards Plateau Escarpment, the
rivers, and Anacacho Mountain. Fr. Manuel, the
Bobole, and the Gueiquesale warriors traveled 20.8
miles west-northwest to the Gueiquesale rancheria
located near the modem town of Brackettville. From
there, Fr. Manuel and the people of both Native
groups returned to the Rio Grande, which they
crossed about three miles downstream from the
place where Fr. Manuel had originally crossed, and
near the same crossing used by the Bosque-Larios
party on their outbound trip.

Populations, Groups, and Coalitions
It has been frequently assumed that the groups
who inhabited the southern and western portions of
the Edwards Plateau had small populations. The
documents do not bear out that notion. Although it
is often impossible to disentangle individual group
numbers from totals, or determine the extent of
temporary and local patterns of fusion and fission,
some numbers should be noted. The smallest stated
individual group population belongs to the
Geniocane, with 188 people (including 75 warriors),
while the largest, 512 people, belongs to the
Gueiquesale. However, these numbers are misleading since the combined population of the Jumee
and Mabibit was only 105 people, and the combined population of the Xoman, Tereodam,
Teaname, and Teimamar was over 1,300 people, or
an average of 325 people per group. The last four
groups mustered 425 warriors, or an average of 106
warriors per group. The preferred number of warriors for a group, or coalition of groups, appears to
have been 100 or more bowmen (Wade 1998:89).
Balcarcel's remark that 24 Native groups mustered
3,700 warriors (about 154 per group) appears to
confirm that assumption.
According to the archival documents discussed
in this article, the groups that inhabited or used the
southwest portion of the Edwards Plateau in 16731675 were: Ape (Jeapa), Bagname, Bibit (Mabibit),
Bobole, Cacaxtle, Catujano, Ervipiame, Geniocane,
Gueiquesale, Jumee, Manos Prietas, Ocane, Patagua
and or Pataguaque, Pinanaca, Saesse, Siano,
Teaname, Teimamar, Teneimamar, Tereodam,
Xoman, and Y orica.
Most of these groups were members of
coalitions. These coalitions can be grouped into
two basic types: macro-social coalitions and micro-

social coalitions. The macro-social coalitions, such
as the coalitions headed by the Gueiguesale, the
Bobole, and the Catujano-Tilijae, incorporated many
groups and reflected their broad concerns. These
macro-social coalitions were agglutinated by means
of interlocking micro-social coalitions. These microcoalitions probably reflected kin ties or concerns
particular to a small number of groups. The size
and life-span of a specific coalition quite likely
reflected the type and duration of defensive,
economic, and political endeavors.

"Territories"
It appears that some group coalitions controlled and defended specific land areas and the
resources in those areas. The evidence is still
sketchy but statements by Balcarcel (Wade
1998:405-408), Fr. Larios and Bosque, together
with the approximate location of the camps of the
Bobo le, Gueiguesale, Y orica and others, give
weight to this interpretation. Those "territories"
seemed to have been composed of slices of land,
oriented north-south, and bordered by main water
courses, such as the Pecos and the Nueces rivers.
A north-south environmental cline provided access to a variety of resources, particularly pricklypear fields and buffalo herds immediately north
and south of the Edwards Escarpment.
The remarks made by various Native leaders
during the period of 1674-1675 indicate intensive
group agglutination but also great tension. The
location of the camps of several groups near the
margins or immediately below the Edwards Escarpment, and the conflicts reported both by Fr.
Manuel and the Bosque-Larios expedition, point
to the need to control the Edwards Escarpment
and the access to the plains immediately to the
south. Further research may invalidate or validate
this interpretation.

Shawn

ABSTRACT
Mission Dolores, one of the earliest established and longest occupied missions in Texas has been the subject
of numerous archeological investigations over the years. Now, that infonnation has been synthesized and
incorporated into exhibits at a newly erected on-site visitor's center. A collection of documents, copied from
repositories throughout the United States, Mexico, and Spain, supplements the archeological facilities,
promoting the center as a Spanish colonial research facility.

RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF
THE MISSION SITE
Development of Mission Dolores de los Ais
has been a dream of San Augustinians for years.
Recently, those dreams have come to fruition with
the completion of a plan designed to preserve, protect, interpret, and develop the archeological site
that lies on the outskirts of their town (Freeman and
Kenmotsu 1993). A newly erected visitor's and
interpretive center graces the site perimeter and
trails meander through the site proper. Exhibits
within the center focus upon integration of the site's
archeology and history as it pertains to: (1) the
Native American culture that preceded establishment of the mission, (2) the period during which
Mission Dolores de los Ais was actively occupied,
and (3) the post-mission period settlement.
Archeological data for exhibits comes from excavations that have taken place through the years
(Corbin et al. 1980, 1990; Carlson and Quinn 1996).
It is hoped that ongoing excavations directed at
specific research issues will regularly provide new
data and serve as a "living" exhibit. The archeological laboratory housed within the new interpretive center provides the space and equipment
necessary to carry out these investigations.
Adjacent to the archeological laboratory is the
archival research library. A collection of newly
acquired Spanish documents is housed in this library, which will serve both as a repository for the
documents and a reading room for researchers
(Benavides 1998).

Funding for programs at the visitor's center
will come from fees charged at a new recreational
vehicle park adjacent to the site that includes vehicular camp sites, tent camp sites, and group shelters. Other sources of revenue include fees from
the visitor's center and taxes generated from tourist expenditures.
Interpretation of Mission Dolores is now being
achieved through museum exhibits and tours of the
site. Long-term plans call for reconstruction of the
mission and construction of an Indian farmstead
that will reflect the life of the missionaries and the
Ais Indians.

A RECAP OF THE MISSION'S

HISTORY
During the 18th century, the mission of Dolores
de los Ais was one of many isolated posts on the
Texas frontier. Its first location was occupied for
only two years (1717-1719) before the threat of
French encroachment forced its abandonment
(Chipman 1992:111-119). The second location of
Dolores, only one-quarter league distant from the
first, operated for 51 years but was never particularly
successful (Forrestal 1935). Situated halfway down
an upland outlier, Mission Dolores was erected in a
small open prairie, surrounded by forest, and
overlooked Ayish Bayou to the west (Figure 1). A
nearby creek supplied water for drinking and for an
adjacent fruit and vegetable garden. Although a
large, level tract, suitable for cultivated fields was

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 70 (1999)

close by, these fields could not be irrigated because
of the steep creek banks.
The geographic location of Mission Dolores
matches those of other mission sites (Corbin
n.d.:6-7). Clearly established in a defensive position, the location was less suitable for agriculture
and may have actually repelled the Ais, who were
accomplished agriculturalists. Although located
centrally to attract the greatest number of Indians,
the eight Ais settlements (rancherias) within two
leagues of Mission Dolores had little use for the
struggling mission.
To date, no documentary information exists regarding the actual arrangement or construction techniques used in the buildings at Mission Dolores de
los Ais. They may have been similar to those at
Mission San Miguel de Linares established approximately 30 leagues to the east during late 1716. A
1767 map of Mission San Miguel de Linares (and
Presidio Los Adaes) drawn by Joseph Urrutia shows
two buildings within the stockaded mission compound (Avery 1997:66). Coincidentally, two diaries describing Mission Dolores mention only two
buildings. These are the 1721-1722 diaries of Don
Juan Antonio de la Pena describing the establishment of Mission Dolores and the 1767-1768 diary
of Fray Gaspar de Solis during his inspection of the
missions (Forrestal 1931, 1935). The structures
mentioned in both diaries are (1) the mission, and
(2) the dwelling for the padres. It is likely that other
structures were built through time and archeological evidence supports an argument for multiple
structures (Corbin et al. 1980, 1990). However, the
low number of soldiers assigned to guard the mission and the inability of the missionaries to attract

Indian converts suggests that additional buildings
may have been unnecessary.
In 1727, the only priest at Mission DoloresFray Pedro Munoz-described the church as beautifully furnished and decorated with "the required
colors to celebrate the holy Sacrifice of the Mass
and to administer the holy Sacraments" (Munoz
1727). Later, in 1767, Solfs described the mission
as a wooden structure kept neat and clean with
well-kept vestments, sacred vessels, and silver utensils (Kress 1931). The dwelling quarters were large
and made of wood.
Between 1736 and 1748 there is little information about the mission, although we do know that
during the year 1744 only two priests with a guard
of two soldiers inhabited the mission (Magnaghi
1984: 175). No Indians were in the mission, apparently due to the lack of funds to support it.
By 1754, these conditions had not changed and
recommendations were made to transfer the Ais
mission to the coast to serve the Karankawan Indians instead. This proposal was successfully defeated
and the mission remained occupied (Nunley
1975:32).
In 1767, an inspection was made of the missions by the Marquis de Rubi. His engineer and
diarist, Nicolas de la Fora, described Mission
Dolores de los Ais as " ... useless as the preceding
one [Guadalupe de Nacogdoches] ... " (Kinnaird
1958:166).
Only a few years later, in 1772, the governor
of Coahuila authorized the closing of the East
Texas missions (Bolton 1970:377-446). The few
settlers at Los Adaes and Los Ais were forced to
abandon their homes and move to San Antonio.
Subsequently, they established a new settlement
in 1774 on the Trinity River called Bucareli.
Bucareli was abandoned in 1779 and its inhabitants moved to Nacogdoches.

PAST ARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS AT
MISSION DOLORES
The site of Mission Dolores de los Ais lay
neglected from the time of its abandonment in 1773
until the early 1960s when archeologists first
became interested in it. Local residents were well
aware of the general site area and referred to it as
"Mission Hill." But, the exact location of the

documented at the mission (cf. Winthuysen 1744),
96 percent of the ceramics were aboriginal (Carlson
1994: 179). Corbin (n.d.:9) attributes this presence
to the use of aboriginal wares by the soldiers and
the priests. The remainder of the collection included
European wares (2 percent), Mexican majolica (1
percent), and Chinese wares (1 percent).
The non-aboriginal wares were somewhat difficult to obtain (Carlson 1994). Chinese porcelains
(Figure 5), which were used in small quantities at
most of the missions, were shipped once a year
from the Philippines, across the Pacific Ocean, to
Acapulco. They were carefully packed on mule
trains that journeyed more than 1000 miles north
through Mexico to the Texas hinterlands. The safe
arrival of these delicate wares to the Spanish missions seems remarkable today.
European wares, like English and German saltglazed stoneware or Dutch and English delft, arrived at the port of Vera Cruz on the east coast of
Mexico and, like the porcelain, were transported

Most recently, excavations were conducted in
1995 and 1996 by Dr. Shawn Bonath Carlson of
Historic Sites Research in College Station (Carlson
and Quinn 1996). Carlson's excavations focused
on the periphery of the mission compound where
plans were being made to construct a visitor's center and parking lot complex. Anticipating Indian
campsites associated with the mission, Carlson and
her team were dismayed to find logging activities
had obliterated any evidence of 18th century debris
around the mission.

THE ARCHEOLOGICAL
EVIDENCE
Thousands of artifacts, variously attributed to
Ais, Mexicans, or Europeans, have been recovered
from Mission Dolores over the years. Of particular
interest is the ceramic assemblage. Despite the fact
that there was never a resident population of Ais

to Texas by mule train. French faience (Figure 6)
probably came through the port of New Orleans
(Walthall 1991 :99). Also, a large variety of handdecorated vessels, both lead-glazed and tin-glazed
(majolica), were made throughout central Mexico
during the 18th century, and these were commonly
used as well (Figure 7). While it is unlikely that
Indians were eating from Chinese, European, or
Mexican wares, it is believed that all occupants or
visitors to the mission were using the easily obtainable and coarsely-made Indian vessels for eating, cooking, and storing food. These low-fired
earthenware vessels comprised the major part of
the ceramic assemblage recovered archeologically
from Mission Dolores de los Ais (Corbin et al.
1980, 1990).
Besides ceramics, some glassware was also
found at Mission Dolores. Most of the glass vessels
were fragments of dark olive green hand-blown
wine bottles (Corbin et al. 1980, 1990). Typically,
these bottles are irregularly shaped and exhibit many

bubbles as a by-product of blowing glass. Pontil
scars are found on the bottle bases and the finishes
have simple fire-polished rims. Applied strips of
glass provided added strength to the rim and made
it easier to seal these bottles (Figure Se-i).
Other glass artifacts included trade beads
(Corbin et al. 1980, 1990). These were found in a
variety of shapes and colors (see Figure Sa-c). The
basic shapes were tubular or round, with the tubular
shape being achieved through blowing and pulling
of molten glass. Round beads were shaped by winding small strands of molten glass around a thin
metal rod.
Metal artifacts were widely varied with nails
being the most abundant ferrous materials recovered (Corbin et al. 1980, 1990). The nails associated with Mission Dolores were all hand-forged
and appeared square in cross-section (Figure 9a-e).
In addition, knife parts, bridle parts (Figure 9f-i),
spur parts (Figure 9j), a key, bullet worms, hasps,
gun parts (Figure lOe-f), kettle fragments, wire

loops, fasteners, and hooks were found. Copper
artifacts, including chocolate cups, bail ears, a kettle
handle (Figure lOi), rivets, buckle fragments, a
candle snuffer, and tinklers (see Figure lOb-c), were
also recovered at the mission. Brass artifacts from
the site included a clasp knife handle (see Figure
lOa), gun parts, furniture ornaments, buttons, spoons
(see Figure lOg), buckles (see Figure lOd), and a
tack. Artifacts of lead were musket balls, shot, bottle
seals, and sheet lead.
These artifacts are all typical European items
that would have been introduced to the missions
by the French or Spanish. Yet the primary population around the mission was the Indians. Their
presence is reflected in the aboriginal pottery and
a limited number of stone tools (Corbin et al.
1980, 1990). The Indian pottery, probably made
from local clay sources, included bits of bone,
shell, and grog as temper. Also, the vessels were
decorated with engraving, incising, and punctating

(Figure 11). Most typically, these aboriginal wares
included types such as Natchitoches Engraved,
Ebarb Incised, and Emory Punctated-Incised.
Trade wares made by the Hasinai Caddo, such as
Patton Engraved (see Figure l lc, g), were also
found at the mission.
Stone artifacts, including gun flints (Figure
12a-h), occur in small quantities at Mission
Dolores de los Ais (Corbin et al. 1980, 1990).
Arrow points (Figure 12i-j), including those made
from glass (see Figure 8d), and lithic debitage
have been found but their small number suggests
that perhaps the Indians were replacing their stone
tools with ones of metal manufacture. Also present
are stone metate fragments imported from Mexico
(Figure 121).
This brief overview of the various artifacts
recovered from the mission site attests to the
presence of the friars, the soldiers, and the Indians
throughout the 18th century at Mission Dolores

plus two priests and a layman were the only
residents at Dolores (Kinnaird 1958).
The Ais Indians, a tribe of the Caddo, only
visited the mission when it was to their advantage
(Hatcher 1927; Hughes 1974). Already successful
agriculturalists, the Indians did not need the missionaries. They lived in dispersed permanent settlements that were self-sufficient, and they only came
to the mission to trade for European items that they
wanted; some became baptized before their deaths.
The Ais primarily cultivated com and beans and
supplemented their meals with deer and an occasional bison. They lived in dome-shaped, thatched
houses with several generations of family. Their
clothing was made of carefully dressed deer skins
or buffalo hide. Men wore little clothing during
warm weather and leggings and shirts when it was
colder. The women, however, were usually covered from head to toe with ankle-length skirts and

THE MISSION INHABITANTS
The mission inhabitants included the priests,
the soldiers, and, occasionally, the native Ais.
Soldiers at Mission Dolores de los Ais were few. A
minimum of two were required at every mission
and they were supplied by the nearest presidio. The
soldiers at Dolores came from nearby Presidio Los
Adaes and, ostensibly, protected the friars. They
also helped in running the mission. When the
Marquis de Rubf inspected the mission in 1767, he
noted that the two soldiers-with their families-

waist-length shirts. All clothing was decorated with
fringes, beads, feathers, etc. The men wore their
hair long, as did the women.
Between sunrise and sunset, the friars sought
to educate the Indians. At Mission Dolores, the
friars were forced to travel to the rancherias because the Indians would not come to the mission
(Kress 1931). However, the large quantity of ceramics recovered from archeological excavations
suggests that Indians did come to the mission despite documents that show otherwise (Corbin et al.
1980, 1990). It is likely that the Ais chose to come
and go as they pleased, never committing themselves to mission life or Christianity. It is also possible that other Indian groups sought refuge at the
mission. During the times that the Ais, or other
tribes, were present at Mission Dolores, daily activities were probably much like those at other missions. The friars devoted themselves to teaching
the Indians Castillian Spanish and, in tum, learned
the native language (Bolton 1962). Although communication was important, the friars believed that

language was the first step toward educating the
Indians about Catholicism. Converting the Indians
to Catholicism was so important that special efforts
were taken to insure that the children-vulnerable,
impressionable, and potential converts-learned to
read and write and speak the Spanish language.
Besides their religious education, the friars indoctrinated the Indians with Spanish culture to insure that they would become loyal subjects (Bolton
1962). The friars supervised every detail of mission
life, i.e., they instructed the Indians in the skills that
were necessary to operate the mission. Agriculture,
animal husbandry, special skills, and crafts were all
part of their education. The soldiers helped the friars in this education by supervising the planting
and harvesting of crops, etc. The Indians were taught
social skills, how to dress appropriately, and even
music and the arts.
The relationships that missionaries developed
with Indians across Texas served to create alliances
for the Spaniards. Converted Indians, especially,
tended to help defend the Spanish against their enemies and provided a security net at the isolated
frontier outposts. Although various documents show
that Mission Dolores failed to convert any Indians
during the years in which it was in operation, their
presence at the mission is known through the archeological record. Their interaction with the Spanish missionaries had effects about which modem
researchers can only speculate.

The Marques De Aguayo's Report to the King
Regarding His Expedition to Restore and
Establish Missions and Presidios
in Texas, 1720-1722

Translated and Edited by David McDonald, Kay Hindes, and Kathleen Gilmore

The following transcription and translation is
the official report made by the Marques de San
Miguel de Aguayo to the King of Spain of his tour
of inspection of the northern frontier of New Spain
from 1720-1722. This expedition "so solidified the
Spanish claim to Texas that it was never again
challenged by the French" (Newton 1996:71). Presented here for the first time, in his own words, is
Aguayo's brief account of his expedition. We believe the document will serve as an important source
of primary archival research to not only archeologists and historians working in the Spanish Colonial period, but to other disciplines as well.
Prior to the publication of this document no
translated version of Aguayo' s account of his expedition has been available to researchers. Foster
( 1995: 145) correctly notes that no record of a diary
account written by Aguayo has been found to date,
but although certainly not as detailed as a daily log
(or derrotero), the following report contributes to
our knowledge and understanding of the expedition. Aguayo himself notes that a record exists of
the expedition's route "which I have sent to be
printed in Mexico" (Aguayo 1722). It is not clear if
this statement indicates that Aguayo maintained his
own daily log, or perhaps was referring to the one
kept by Father Juan Antonio de la Pena (Forrestal
1935). The possibility that such a document may
exist is important and exciting.
Although earlier historians (Buckley 1911;
Castaneda 1936-1958; Hackett 1945), as well as

more recent ones (Chipman 1992), obviously had
access to the untranslated document or a similar
one, apparently no translation was ever published
of this particular account. Chipman (1992)
references an additional report sent to the Viceroy
by Aguayo, and while this document contains
much of the same information as the report to the
King, the following account is more inclusive.
Archeologists and historians have relied primarily
on the much more extensive and detailed account
of the expedition recorded and written by Father
Pena (Forrestal 1935).
The Aguayo account is presented here with
minimal annotation. We acknowledge this could be
considered a flaw of this article, but believe that in
the interest of making the data available we are
justified in doing so. Also, as noted above, a number of historians have previously presented richly
annotated accounts and narratives of the expedition
and we direct the interested reader to these additional published sources.
Located in the archival collections at the Old
Spanish Missions Historical Research Library, Our
Lady of the Lake University, in San Antonio, Texas,
this document is one of two that Aguayo wrote to
the Viceroy and the King detailing his expedition.
The document was located by Research Historian
Kay Hindes in 1997 while undertaking primary research regarding the first site of the Mission Nuestra
Senora Espiritu Santo de Zuniga, founded on
Garcitas Creek in present day Victoria County. The

Bulletin of the Texas Arclzeological Society 70 (1999)

mission was originally established in 1721, but not
formally dedicated by Aguayo until 1722. The site
of this mission has not been found to date, despite
extensive field surveys and archival research.
Hindes contacted two of her colleagues to assist in
the verification, analysis, and translation of the
document: David McDonald, an experienced translator of Spanish Colonial documents, and Dr.
Kathleen Gilmore, historical archeologist.
McDonald verified the document and produced a
scholarly transcription and translation. Dr. Gilmore
provided expertise concerning the veracity of the
document, and provided funding for the translation.
This account currently is a part of the research
studies associated with the site of 41 VT4, La Salle's
Fort St. Louis located on Garcitas Creek in presentday Victoria County. The document, found prior to
the beginning of contracted research for this ongoing project, is direct confirmation and validation
of Father Pena's account that the Spanish Presidio
del Loreto, present by at least 1721, and formerly
established by Aguayo in 1722, was built directly
at the place where the French fort had been located
as per the direct orders of the King. Additionally,
we believe the document serves to clarify and elucidate a number of other areas for archeologists and
historians interested in the Spanish Colonial period. We are grateful to Dr. James E. Bruseth and
Mike Davis of the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission, and to Dr. Timothy K. Perttula,
Texas Archeological Society Publications Editor,
for their cooperation in the timely publication of
this significant document.
Written in his own words, and read as such,
we are able to begin to understand that a man of
such importance as the Marques de Aguayo needed
and desired to undertake and perform a deed of
great importance. By doing so, he was "responsible for the beginnings of colonization in Texas"
(Newton 1996:71), and established his place firmly
in our history.

THE MARQuES DE AGUAYO'S REPORT
TO THE KING REGARDING HIS
EXPEDITION TO RESTORE AND
ESTABLISH MISSIONS AND
PRESIDIOS IN TEXAS, 1720-1722
The Marques de San Miguel de Aguayo,
Captain General of the Military Arms of Your

Majesty on the frontiers of New Spain, reports
to Your Majesty that he has secured your
beautiful province of the Texas Indians, the
New Kingdom of the Philippines, by having
established a presidia at the Bahia of Espiritu
Santo, another presidia in the center of Texas,
and another on the frontier near Natchitoches.
Along with these fortifications, including the
presidia of San Antonio (which was
untenable), he also established nine missions
and placed seventy Indian nations under the
obedience of Your Majesty across this
province, which extends two hundred fifty
leagues in length and eighty in breadth. 1
/fl My good fortune to serve Your Majesty

with the general command of these frontiers
of New Spain reached its zenith with the honor
that your royal generosity conferred upon me,
by the dispatch you signed in Aranjuez on
May 26, 1721. Thus with the knowledge that
you had entrusted to my modest abilities the
restoration of Texas, or New Philippines, the
arms of Your Majesty have prevailed and
with little more than a feint your legitimate
domain was restored.
Misfortunes and various acts of war exiled
Your Majesty's pleasing dominion of Texas
(which borders on the confines of Coahuila),
except for the Presidio of San Antonio. It
would appear that all the denizens of Hell
conspired to maintain this tyrannical empire
by which barbarism was prolonged, resulting
in the abominable scorn by which the Catholic religion was profaned by the barbarous,
idolatrous Indians. It conspired to abolish the
six missions by fomenting their diabolical
astuteness, and by delaying my expedition by
imposing the obstacle of severe storms.
During all of 1720, my departure from this
province of Coahuila, or New Extremadura,
was delayed by a great drought that caused
the loss of 3,500 horses. The replacement
of them, and all the military and food
supplies, could not be achieved until the
beginning of October. This is the time of
copious rains of the Fall season, and I
decided that I could not begin the march
until the middle of November. The rivers
flooded out of their banks with such forceful
risings that they greatly hindered me in

Transkltion by McDonald, Hindes and Gilmore of the Marques De Aguayo's Report to the King
crossing with the six-hundred troops 2 plus
twenty horses, six hundred steers, ninehundred sheep, and eight-hundred mules for
the baggage and food supplies. This is in
addition to what was stored at the Presidios at
San Juan Bautista and San Antonio. I was
detained only by Rio Sabinas and the Rio del
Norte (commonly called Rio Grande), which
flows through this province (of Coahuila]. I
remained at its banks until March 20, 1721,
until its currents subsided and because of bad
weather of the season that produced ice, snow,
and rain. Flooding slowed the fifty swimmers
whom I directed to cross using rafts made of
wooden beams, barrels and rushes. I had no
other way to cross the Rio del Norte. It was
done with such effort and risk that some loads
were lost, and two soldiers were endangered.
From there, daily marches had to be adjusted
because of the intense heat. All of the other
sixteen rivers I found to be fordable //3 except
the Trinity and the Neches, which flows by
the site where the first mission was built. I
spent nearly a month in crossing them. While
we were there [at the Neches], the Comander
of Texas, Monsieur St. Denis, came with a
guard party and asked me to negotiate
concerning the interests of the two crowns.
His said that he knew Your Majesty had
agreed to truces with France in Europe and
that adherence to them should be observed
in these lands. To that I responded according
to the orders of Your Majesty which I now
carried that authorized only defensive
warfare, once that province was recovered. I
said that it would be advisable for him to
depart, to retreat immediately with all his
people to Nachitoches, 3 the terminus
prescribed my orders.
With his capitulation, he delivered to me the
entire province. Continuing my march I reestablished all the missions. I went among
the Indians-as many as sixty nations in the
remainder of this province-flattering them
and providing gifts so that they would willingly render obedience to Your Majesty. I
gave them to understand that Your Majesty
would admit them under your royal patrimony; that you wished for them the greatest
good: that they would come to know the
True God, and that in return they were to
congregate in the missions. They showed me

that they would comply by planting crops,
especially at Mission Concepcion //4 of Our
Lady. It is in the center of the land of the Texas
Indians, where I found many Caddodacho,
Bidays, Yogdocas, and other nations that the
Comandant St. Denis had recently convened.
His intent (according to what I learned from
the Texas Indians) was to take over the Bahia
del Espiritu Santo and then to proceed to
invade San Antonio (I had already been at
La Bahia for four months, providing it with
a presidio and forty soldiers).
These storm clouds faded like smoke with the
arrival of Your Majesty's arms. And having
reestablished the five missions (building again
the churches and residences of the priests) I
built a presidio in the center for their protection, designing the fortification to correspond
to the twenty-five men planned for it. I continued my journey to Los Adaes, where I
arrived on August 29. There, the comandante
of Nachitos, Monsieur Rererenau, wanted to
hinder our occupation of that place with chicanery. He said that he had no order from
Mobile that would allow me to fortify and
take possession of that area, and thus I would
have to halt. But when I responded that I
carried orders to the contrary that I was bound
to execute at any cost, he yielded his position, capitulating like Comandant St.
Denis-he whom we had running truces.
Having reconnoitered all that frontier, I established the sixth mission and constructed a
Presidio of one hundred men at the place
that I found to be most advantageous for all.
It is seven leagues from Nachitoches and a
little more than a half league from a large
lake, through which the Rio de Cadodachos
passes and forms the Island of Nachitos. The
presidio was completed in the form of a
hexagon, that I sketched, removing from it
three bastions so as to provide the mounting
that it had to have for the six campaign artillery pieces that I brought.
I began my return on November 17. From the
first steps, the returning was more troublesome than the coming because of the terrible
weather. Rain, snow, and ice broke an infinite
number of trees and uprooted them from the
weight of the ice. So many horses, mules, and
oxen died that, from the [land of the] Texas,

61

almost all the people traveled on foot, the
hardship being such that even officials
marched in the same manner. I also made
some marches on foot in order to share in the
fatigue. Because of the shortage of mules
and the slowness of the marches, my greatest concern was to zelously watch to see if
the food supplies were faltering. But this did
not happen, although we reached San Antonio with but 100 of the 800 mules and 50 of
the 2,000 horses.
We had to leave behind, halfway along the
road, about 150 loads and almost all the soldiers' saddles-to be watched over by guards.
Nevertheless, I had the good fortune of not
endangering a single soldier. Upon arrival in
San Antonio, I recognized, as has been said,
that the Presidio was vulnerable to any attack
by Indians because it was completely indefensible. I surveyed and caused to begin construction of a fortification with four baluartes
proportioned for a company of 54 soldiers.
I sent for replacements of mules and horses,
and with those that I could gather, I went to
La Bahfa in order to strengthen that presidio
with fifty soldiers and to set up the fortification at the place where Monsieur La Salle had
his fort. As Your Majesty ordered, thus have
I executed; for the location is still known of
the holes where they burned the powder and
buried the artillery. I found pieces of muskets
and other iron pieces during the digging of
the foundations, which I recorded in the sketch
which, along with those of the other presidios,
I am remitting to Your Majesty. Also included is the chart of the bay that I had
sounded and the sand bar that was well reconnoitered. The bay will be secure as if locked
with a key if a small fortress is built and
equipped with artillery at the Cape ofNuestra
Senora de Buena Fortuna. 4 There are two
springs of sweet water there, but they can
not 6// support more than twenty-five soldiers. When families come, a town could be
established closer to the sea on the banks of
the Guadalupe River. The route to Veracruz
was determined, the coast being observed
with a sloop rented at my expense for 305
pesos, in order to bring to La Bahfa the
supplies that came in my care. I have requested payment of 1,300 pesos from Your

Majesty. Having supplied the captain of the
presidio, provided for the fortification of that
port, and increased his staff by fifty men, I
returned to San Antonio in accord with my
orders. Supplied with fresh horses, I continued the return march (to Coahuila] in order to
reduce the license [term of service] for the
rest of the troops, which I effected in this
capital5 on the 31st of the past month.
The result of my expedition is in accord with
most recent orders of Your Majesty: a barricade has been formed by the presidios that I
constructed in that province, equiping it as
bastion for the Kingdoms of New Spain. The
missions have been increased, as the Catholic zeal of Your Majesty desires. In addition
to the six missions that I restablished among
the Texas Indians, there is now one in La
Bahfa and two in San Antonio, including the
mission that was already there before my
expedition, 7// and many Indians were left
congregated in them, as is demonstrated by
the testimonies of the foundings which I am
remitting to Your Majesty.
For the progress, establishment, and
maintenance of this province, as well as to
save Your Majesty many expenditures by
not having to maintain so many soldiers or
presidios, it is indispensable to settle it with
two-hundred families of Spaniards from
Galicia, the Canary Islands, or Havana. For
these are people better equipped to work in
this climate. Also needed are another two
hundred families from Gran Tlaxcala which,
by way of Veracruz, could arrive at La Bahfa
for a modest cost. The Tlaxcalans have
proven themselves in all parts of the colony,
and since they are very devoted to the Divine
Cult their example would serve as a great
stimulus to [reduce] that interminable
gentilism. The two hundred families could
be distributed among La Bahia, San Antonio,
the missions of Adaes and the Texas Indians.
Another town of Spaniards and Tlaxcalans
could be founded half-way along the road at
either of the two points of Anguila or Nuestra
Senora de Buena Vista, for the one hundred
seventy-two leagues between San Antonio
and the first mission of Texas6 are unpopulated. Without these families //8 it will be
difficult if not impossible to maintain that

province- which should be for Your
Majesty one of the best in America because
of the great fertility and amenities of the
land (which is specifically expressed in the
record of the expedition's route, which I
have sent to be printed in Mexico). The
province is suitable of all types of crops and
livestock and is lacking in nothing but
agriculture and a populace who, as they
explore the land, will solicit the richest mining
claims so they can be worked for the pleasure
of Your Majesty. [In turn], Your Majesty
could employ your treasures to rescue the
innumerable souls who live in the unhappy
captivity of idolatry, whose voracious flames
are being vanquished by the ocean within the
immense sea of grace of Holy Baptism that is
frequently administered.
I have desired in this enterprise to discharge
my obligation and my love for the royal service of Your Majesty, in which I hope the
little I have done may supplement the great
desire I have had for its completion. If Your
Majesty provides, bequeathing for my service, I will obtain the greatest prize to which I
have aspired. Even though my broken health
persists-which began upon leaving San Antonio-I take [pride J7 in having employed
that also in the service of Your Majesty. Having concluded with the recovery//9 of that
province, insofar that it was made my responsibility, I left those provinces and obtained
permission to retire to my home, which I did
this week. Nevertheless, I would still go forth
to whatever part of the world that Your Majesty may order. As long as I have breath, I
will not lack the will to employ my life in the
service of Your Majesty. May God watch
over the Catholic and Royal Person of Your
Majesty for the many years that Christianity
has need of you. Coahuila, June 13, 1722

Bronze Cannons and Ardent Spirits
at La Bahia

Curtis Tunnell

ABSTRACT
A cache of copper and iron artifacts excavated near Mission Espiritu Santo at Goliad in 1930 are described
and related to Spanish documents of the period. Two bronze cannons and a large copper still in the cache add
significantly to our knowledge of Spanish colonial material culture in Texas.

INTRODUCTION

BRONZE CANNONS

La Bahfa, Spanish for "The Bay," was a term
originally applied to the Spanish Presidio Nuestra
Senora de Loreto located on the site of La Salle's
Fort Saint Louis at the head of Lavaca Bay. After
subsequent relocations, the Presidio and Mission
Nuestra Senora del Espfritu Santo de Zuniga were
established on the San Antonio River near Goliad,
Texas, in 1749 (Roell 1996:1180). A settlement
known as La Bahfa grew up around the presfdio
and mission. In this paper, the term La Bahfa refers to the entire complex of presfdio, mission,
and townsite.

The two bronze cannons from La Bahfa first
came to my attention about 1970, when the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department was installing interpretive exhibits at Goliad State Park. Virtually no
provenience information was available on the cannons at that time, but it was assumed that they had
been found at that site because of the notation "Site
Find" on the catalog card. After the Texas Historical
Commission began working on La Salle's ship La
Belle in 1997, several people told us that we should
examine the old "French Cannon" at Goliad State
Park. There were some recent news articles that mentioned a French cannon at Goliad that may have
been brought over by La Salle. On a trip to the coast,
I stopped by Goliad and asked if they had a French
cannon. The park attendant said that indeed they had
a French gun and took me to an exhibit case. There
was one of the Spanish bronze cannons that I remembered from years back. The elaborate dedication plaque on the cannon is a bit obscure (Figure 1),
but the gun is obviously Spanish in origin. This
cannon is illustrated and properly attributed as being of Spanish origin in The Presidio La Bahia del
Espiritu Santo de Zuniga (O'Connor 1966:54).
Adding to the confusion over the identity of
these guns was an article in the Goliad Advance
Guard, dated October 27, 1930, which quotes
Yoakum (1855:22):

cannons, and not a single ball. These
pieces of artillery were afterwards transported to La Bahfa (now Goliad), and
used by the Spaniards till 1812 ... where
as late as 1838, they were seen, with the
impression of Louis XIV upon them.

We now know that this statement is not true, because the eight La Salle cannons were excavated in
September 1997 by the Texas Historical Commission at Fort Saint Louis on Garcitas Creek where
they were buried by Don Alonzo De Leon in 1689
(Tunnell 1998). In the book Prairiedom: Rambles
and Scrambles in Texas or New Estremadura
(Suthron 1845:140) it is said: "Goliad was first
settled in 1662 [sic] by M. La Salle, a Frenchman.
Some of his descendants, it is said, now live here,
and there are French cannon here which they
brought, with the impression of Louis XIV, on
them." Again, this statement is so patently permeated with errors that it is meaningless, but it nevertheless has contributed to the myth of French
cannons at Goliad.

FINDING OF THE BRONZE GUNS
It all started with an article in Popular Mechanics magazine in early 1930, describing how to
build a metal detecting device. August Leeder of
Center Point, Texas, was mechanically inclined and
decided to try his hand at making one of the contraptions. Harley Johnson was born and raised in
Goliad, but was working at a hospital in Kerrville
when he met Gus Leeder. Harley's older brother,
Sam Johnson, was still living on the farm at Goliad
and had long dreamed of finding buried treasures

around the old Spanish mission and Presfdio (La
Bahfa) on the San Antonio River.
One conversation led to another, and in September 1930, Gus and Harley arrived at the Johnson
farm in Goliad with the "electrical-magnetic" machine which Gus had built. Well, it did not take
long for them to strike paydirt. On about the 10th of
September, they made a big hit down by the river
near the old mission (Nuestra Senora del Espfritu
Santo de Zuniga, third location). After digging down
a few feet, they were flabbergasted to find a large
bronze cannon, which had been cut through the
middle into two pieces (Figure 2). The cannon was
some five feet long, with a bore diameter of three
and one-eighth inches, and with one trunion missing. The cannon had an eroded Spanish coat of
arms and some other markings. Along with the
cannon, they found two large copper vessels and
many other artifacts (see Figure 1). Partially filling-in the hole and taking their treasures home,
they began to worry about reporting the find.
Judge Fowler of the Fannin Battlefield Commission and County Judge J. A White of Goliad already
had gotten news of the treasure seeker's activities. Being avid history buffs, they wasted no time in going out
to the Johnson farm where they found the cannon in the
front yard, covered with a cottonsack. On September
13th, the Johnsons and Leeder brought the cannon to
Judge White's office (see Figure 2), and surrendered
it when they were assured that they were not giving up
any "finders rights" which they might have. The receipt which they received, on Judge White's stationery and dated September 13, 1930 (Goliad County
Library, Judge White collection), reads in part:
This is to certify that August Leeder,
Harley Johnson, and Sam Johnson, have

Figure 2. Spanish Bronze Cannon GOSP-419 as found in 1930. Special Collections, Victoria College.

Tunnell - Bronze Cannons and Ardent Spirits at La Bahia
this day brought to my office an ancient
cannon which the parties state they found
near La Bahia Mission on the San Antonio River, the cannon being dug out of
the ground. This cannon has been left
with me by the parties above mentioned
with the understanding on their part that
they do not relinquish or abandon any
legal rights they may have as finders of
the cannon. They state they recognize
State ownership in the cannon and only
ask to be protected in so far as their rights
as finders obtain (Goliad County Library,
Judge White collection).
The document is signed by Judge White, Leeder,
and the two Johnsons. Judge White explained to
them: "That a river's bend was state property and
that property could not be legally claimed by a
finder if the finder knew it's rightful owner" (Goliad
Advance Guard, September 25, 1930).
Now that an understanding had been reached,
Leeder and the Johnsons carried out more digging
in the "treasure hole." Judge White described their
metal detector as a wire-covered frame attached to
a battery and earphones. The frame was carried on
the operator's shoulders and a buzzing noise was
heard. The judge tried the instrument and said it
worked perfectly (Goliad Advance Guard, September 25, 1930). Soon they had found the breech half
of another bronze Spanish cannon with elaborate
decoration. Excitement filled the air. The finders
invited Governor Dan Moody to come to Goliad
and receive the cannons. He declined and urged
them to keep the whole matter quiet. Ms. Clara
Driscoll was also invited, but had other travel plans.
Lawyers were consulted. Local newspapers carried
stories of the finds. A state-wide tour of the cannons was discussed. By September 19th, Judge
White had both halves of both cannons in his office, and the public was invited to view them. An
article in the Houston Chronicle dated September
19, 1930, says in part:
The second cannon unearthed near La
Bahia Mission within a week was
delivered to County Judge J. A. White by
Sam Johnson, one of the finders of the
first cannon, which was located with the
aid of an electrical instrument. Both were
found at the same spot. The success with
which the ancient guns were discovered

67

by use of an electrical instrument
probably will cause extensive employment of such devices in similar searches.
[The beginning of an era!]
The smaller bronze cannon, also in two pieces,
was ornately decorated with a crest, obscure writings, and decorations, which resembled fleur-de-lis
(see discussion below). This cannon was about four
feet long, with a one and 3/4-inch bore and both
trunions intact. Almost immediately, people and
the press began to speculate that this cannon might
be of French origin, and may have even come over
with La Salle. Locally, this has been known as a
"French cannon" to the present day.
In May 1931, Senator J. W. Stevenson of
Victoria asked the Legislature to appropriate $3,000,
"an exorbitant sum," to settle with the cannon
finders. In a letter to Judge White, dated May 14,
1931 (Goliad County Library, Judge White collection), Senator Stevenson says: "There are two
or three men who are claiming ownership of the
cannon taken out of the grounds of La Bahfa Mission. I do not think these claimants have any valid
claim on these relics. However, I am willing to
make a fair settlement with them if my associates
in the Legislature will agree" (Goliad County Library, Judge White collection). Alas, no record
has been found that the Senator was successful in
getting his legislative colleagues to appropriate
money for cannons in what must have been a very
tight-money session.
The two halves of both cannons were soldered
back together, and after a time in Judge White's
office, they were put on permanent exhibit in Goliad
State Park. In fact, the cannons and other artifacts
recovered in 1930 were instrumental in getting public support for creation of the park by the Legislature in March 1931.
In a letter from Judge White to a Mr. McVea
in Houston, he says in part: "The parties who found
them [the cannons] were searching for money, and
did their work at night. They surrendered the cannon and pots to me as county judge. We feel that
the cannon should eventually be placed in the Goliad
State Park for permanent exhibit." And so it has
been for over 60 years.
Leopold Morris of the Victoria Advocate made
a serious attempt to identify the markings on the
two cannons. A letter to Morris from 0. J. Gatchell
of the Ordinance Department dated October 7, 1930

cannons were forthcoming from
the many sources consulted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE
LARGER CANNON
(CATALOG NUMBER
GOSP-419)

The first cannon found by
Leeder and the Johnsons is of cast
brass or bronze. It had been cut
through immediately in front of
the trunions (see Figure 2), and
one trunion and both lifting
handles had been removed.
Deeply impressed hammer blows
occur on both sides of the cut
which severed the cannon before
it was buried. The gun is relatively devoid of decoration except for a badly eroded crest
immediately toward the breech
from the lifting handles (see Figure 3). The touchhole has been
spiked. The figure "4" was chiselcut into the top of the gun near
the muzzle, and a "5" appears
between the breech and the crest
(see Figure 3). There is a distinct
reinforce at the breech, and the

throughout the length. The chisel-cut through the
cannon at the time of burial, was crudely soldered
together at the time it was recovered in 1930. Dimensions of this cannon appear in Figure 5. At the
time of documentation, this cannon was mounted on
a crudely wrought wooden carriage and rested atop a
mock bastion in the exhibit hall of Goliad State Park;
consequently, its weight could not be determined.

The Texas Parks and Wildlife staff graciously
removed the smaller cannon from an exhibit case
where it had rested for 25 years, in order to make it
available for study by this researcher. This brass or
bronze gun weighs no more than about 100 pounds
and is cylindrical in shape (Figure 6). This small
ornate cannon likely was a presentation piece used
more for saluting, signaling, and ceremonial purposes than for defense. It saw heavy use through
many years of service. The bore of the gun shows a
myriad oflinear striations running lengthwise where
cannonballs and perhaps chain, nails, stones, and
other things were fired through it. The touchhole is
eroded into a broad pit and has been spiked.
This gun is richly ornamented with both
molded and chased decorations. The muzzle face is
decorated with a molded floral motif, and there is a
bevel down to the bore (Figure 7). A series of six
raised rings or reinforcements divide the barrel into
segments, with the first rings being at the muzzle
and the sixth set at the breech (see Figure 6). Between the fourth and the fifth rings is a raised crest
with chased burgees or pennants on either side (Figure 8), and small impressed stamps of a lion passant
and crest with the name "JURADO." Jurado is a
common name in southern Spain, and almost certainly identifies the maker of this cannon.
Toward the breech from the third and fifth
rings are chased designs resembling fleur-de-lis,
which have probably led to this cannon being
wrongly attributed for decades to the French (see
Figure 7). Philip V ruled Spain between 1700 and
1746, and he was a grandson of Louis XIV and

born at Versailles. A Fleur-de-lis design could
well have been used in Spain during his reign.
Between the second and third rings is a cartouche with "San Juan Bautista" and a "91" (see
Figure 7). Below the "91" is a chased medallion
with obscure wording which says: "DEL SARGENTO MAYOR DON JUAN ESCUDERO Y
ARN EDO." The letters are all run together and
complicated by use of small subletters, double letters, and backward "N's," as if done by someone
of limited literacy (Figure 9). This panel may well
attribute this ceremonial cannon to the person who
had it commissioned.
Like the larger cannon, this small one was cut
into two pieces immediately on the muzzle side of
the trunions at the time of its burial. After its

recovery in 1930, it was soldered back together
rather crudely, with the joint being incompletely
closed on the bottom side of the cannon. The modern solder protrudes about l cm into the bore.
One of the lifting handles is missing from the
top of the cannon and the one remaining probably
represents a jumping dolphin, but it is very crudely
executed. The rings on the bottom side of the gun
are heavily worn, as if the gun was often draggedaround on this face. On either side of the breech
end of the gun are many fine chisel marks and
scratches in a random pattern, covering an area
some 80 mm in diameter. There is a prominent
bulge at the base of the breech, and the cascabel is
long and narrow with a small knob on the end.
Dimensions of this cannon appear in Figure 6.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE CRESTS
Considerable effort has been expended in
attempting to identify the coats-of-arms on the two
bronze cannons from La Bahfa, and has met with
some success. The heavily eroded crest on the larger
cannon, GOSP-419, has not been identified with
certainty, but Dr. John de Bry of the Center for
Historical Archaeology in Florida feels that it is
"clearly Spanish" and probably is a device awarded
after a naval battle to the first seaman or officer to
board an enemy ship.
Dr. de Bry, working with Michel Paret, an
archivist in Seville, was successful in finding the
crest-of-arms from the small cannon (GOSP-148),
in a listing of 13,000 coats-of-arms. It belongs to
the family Arnuero, from a place name Muruelo,
jurisdiction of Villa de Santofio, in the province of
Santander. The owner of the crest appears to be
Jose Prado Guenes Arneuro y de la Sota, who received the Order of Alcantara, as shown in the
crest, in the year 1737. This may indicate that the
cannon was cast soon after that date.

CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING
THE CANNONS

Figure 9. Presentation Plaque on Spanish
Bronze Cannon GOSP-148.

The two bronze cannons from La Bahfa add
significantly to our inventory of Spanish Colonial
material culture in Texas. We may never know for
sure if the guns were cast in Mexico or in Spain.
In any case, the two cannons must have been of
considerable value at this remote outpost, where
they had been brought across many rivers by
oxcart or pack animals. They appear to have been
used for decades.
It is said that gunners liked bronze guns because they would bulge before they cracked, and
crack before they burst. Iron guns, on the other
hand, would sometimes explode disastrously without warning. Another advantage of these small guns
was their relatively light weight, as they could be
easily maneuvered by two or three men. Four and
six-pounder iron guns, like the French cannons
found at Fort Saint Louis (Tunnell 1998:40), weighin at 800 to 1000 pounds and are much more difficult to handle.
These small bronze cannons were probably
used more often for ceremonial occasions than for
defense or offense. Such guns serve well for

Tunnell - Bronze Cannons and Ardent Spirits at La Bahia
celebrating weddings, funerals, patriotic holidays,
and saluting the arrival of dignitaries. Also, the
noise and fire that issued from these cannons were
very effective in intimidating Native Americans who
were unaccustomed to such firepower.
Soon after Presidio La Bahia and Mission
Espiritu Santo were moved to the San Antonio
River in 1749, on the recommendation of Jose de
Escandon, the well-armed garrison had six eightpounder cannons (Roell 1996: 1068). It is not specified if these large guns were iron or bronze, but at
that date they were likely iron. There is no mention of the two small bronze guns being at the
settlement in 1750. Governor Martos y Navarrete
(1762) inspected the Presfdio in 1762 and mentioned six eight-pounder cannons made of iron and
two swivel guns, but makes no mention of the two
small bronze cannons.
Captain Juan Cortes, who commanded the
Presidio in 1795, reported that there were eight
serviceable cannons at La Bahia of twelve and sixteen caliber, with gunners ladles, wool swabs, waddings, and powder scoops (Cortes 1796). However,
he said that because they lacked experienced people
to serve these guns, he had no faith in the utility of
this artillery should it need to be used. "I have no
confidence in the troop in charge of the
cannons ... because the Presidio is laid out without
any order in the town's center, the cannons would
destroy the larger part of the houses if served with
ball and shot" (Cortes 1796).
Upon returning from a trip to Nacogdoches,
Captain Cortes recovered two bronze cannons that
had been abandoned by Don Antonio Gil Ybarbo
at the old townsite of Pilar de Bucareli on the Trinity River (Castaneda 1942:180). Gil Ybarbo had
transported four bronze and two iron cannons from
Presidio Los Adaes to Bucareli when it was established back in 1774 (Castaneda 1939:315). Captain
Cortes said in a January 16, 1796 letter to Governor Munoz:
As for the cannons at Nacogdoches, I
can only say that I saw them resting on
the earth without carriages, supported
only by logs. In just such a condition
did I find the bronze guns I observed on
the Trinity River, where they were abandoned by Don Antonio Gil Ybarbo (the
ones Your Honor ordered brought
hither) (Cortes 1796).

73

Then, in May 1795, Ensign Cadena brought back
to La Bahia a bronze swivel gun from the Trinity River crossing where Bucareli had once stood
(Cortes 1795). This put at least three old bronze
cannons of unspecified poundage at La Bahfa in
1795.
Since Mission Espiritu Santo had only two
small cracked bells, Captain Cortes requested that
the governor send a master craftsman to melt-down
the bronze cannons found at old Bucareli and cast
substantial bells for the church, but permission was
denied by the governor. In 1797, the mission was
still requesting new bells, and eventually was
granted bells from one of the San Antonio missions
that had been secularized (Castaneda 1942:180). A
former presidial commander at La Bahia left a long
outstanding debt of 400 pesos due Mission Espiritu
Santo. One wonders if two of the old bronze cannons may have been given by Captain Cortes, to
the Mission as potential bell metal, in payment of
this debt.
It seems likely that the two bronze cannons
excavated near Mission Espfritu Santo in 1930,
were at Presidio Los Adaes, then were moved to
Pilar de Bucareli by Gil Ibarbo in 1774, were
abandoned on this site from 1779 until 1795,
when they were transported to La Bahia. Captain
Cortes obviously thought little of the guns and
proposed that they be melted to make bells for
the mission. The final question is when and by
whom the guns were destroyed and buried beside
the San Antonio River.
The following hypotheses concerning the cannons are proposed:

1. That the two bronze cannons excavated near
Mission Espiritu Santo in 1930, began their
Texas odyssey at Presidio San Juan Bautista
on the Rio Grande in the early 18th century;
2. That at some later date they were moved to
Presfdio Los Adaes which confronted the
French at Natchitoches;
3. That they were transported in 1774, along with
two other bronze guns and two of iron, by Don
Antonio Gil Ybarbo to the new village of Pilar
de Bucareli on the Trinity River;
4. That when Bucareli was abandoned after a

74

Texas Archeological Society
disastrous flood in 1779, the bronze cannons
lay hidden and ignored beside the Trinity
River for the next 16 years;

5. That in 1795, Captain Cortes found and recovered the old bronze cannons and transported them to Presidio La Bahfa on the San
Antonio River;
6. That since the Presidio had much larger and
more serviceable guns, Cortes asked
permission to have the old bronze guns made
into bells, but permission was denied;
7. That to settle a long overdue debt of 400
pesos by previous commander Manuel
Espadas, Captain Cortes cut the two least
serviceable bronze guns (excluding the
bronze swivel) into pieces and gave them to
Mission Espfritu Santo as potential bell metal,
at the time of his retirement in 1797;
8. That when secularization finally came to the
dilapidated and mostly deserted Mission
Espfritu Santo in 1830, the priest had the
parishioners bury the old cannon fragments,
a huge copper pot (see below), and other
items not worth transporting to San Antonio,
and of no use to the few remaining families;
and

and pain in this dangerous and remote outpost of
New Spain. A spectacular artifact in the museum
at Goliad State Park may reveal that distilled spirits were indeed available to the soldiers, settlers,
and clerics of La Bahia.
Using a home-made metal detector, Gus
Leeder, Harley Johnson, and Sam Johnson located
and excavated a giant copper vessel (GOSP-421)
along with two destroyed bronze cannons in 1930
(Figure 10; see also Figure 1). Quite a variety of
artifacts were found by the treasure hunters in a
pit near Mission Espfritu Santo, and due to the
efforts of County Judge J. A. White, the cannons
and large spherical copper vessel were preserved
in the newly created state park.
Although I saw the large copper vessel in
1970, it meant nothing .to me at the time. But
while studying primitive distilleries (viiiatas) in
the Chihuahuan desert around La Junta in the midl 980s, I saw a number of large spherical copper
vessels used in the distilling of sot61 liquor. When
I again saw the vessel in the museum at Goliad
State Park, in 1998, I recognized it immediately as
a "per61" for distilling liquor.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PEROL
This beautiful example of Spanish Colonial
craftsmanship is almost identical in size and
conformation to the recent per6ls around La Junta

9. That the old bronze cannon fragments faded
from the memory of local families and lay in
their pit beside the San Antonio River until
found by Gus Leeder' s metal detector in September 1930.
In 1846, the City of Goliad reserved the old
Mission grounds and 20 acres of land to serve as
the site for county or college buildings. The City
and County of Goliad transferred this site to the
State on March 24, 1931, for use as a historic park.

COPPER STILL OR PEROL
Spanish documents, so rich in detail on many
subjects, remain largely silent concerning the availability and use of alcoholic beverages on the Texas
frontier. Most would agree that ardent spirits must
have been required to relieve some of the misery

Figure 10. Copper per61 excavated near Mission Espiritu
Santo in 1930.

Tunnell- Bronze Cannons and Ardent Spirits at La Bahia
(Figure 11 ), but it is more ornate in execution.
The per61 is made from three pieces of hammered
copper, put together with elaborate riveted joins
(Figure 12), forming a spherical vessel 256 cm in
circumference around the middle and 70 cm deep
from lip to bottom. The vertical neck of the vessel
is 26 cm in diameter and 5.5 to 6.0 cm in height,
ending in a rolled lip. Just below the bottom join
is a drainage hole 10 cm in diameter with a riveted
reinforcing band around the circumference. This
drain facilitated the removal of water and dregs
from the per61 between distillations. The bottom
of the per61 is somewhat flattened.
The copper sheets from which the per61 is
formed are a uniform thickness of about 0.3-0.5
mm. The joins were formed by overlapping the
sheets by 3.7-4.0 cm. The upper sheet and lower
sheet both overlap the central body sheet. Heavy
rivets are spaced evenly at 4.5 cm intervals along
both joins. The rivets protrude about 5 mm on the
outside and are surrounded by a hexagonal pattern
of four rows of chisel marks (see Figure 12). On
the inside of the vessel, the rivets are hammered
flush with the surface. A chased mark along the
back edge of the join completes the design.
The per61 has extensive damage, including
missing fragments on the backside, and these may
have occurred during its burial and excavation.
Riveted repairs to some of these breaks were made
in the 1930s.

PRODUCTION OF DISTILLED
ALCOHOL
Sources of sugars for distillation during the
colonial period at La Bahfa could have included
grains, sugar cane, and agaves. Since grain and
sugar cane would have been in demand as food,
agaves may have been a more likely source of
liquors. Knowledge of preparing alcoholic beverages from agaves was probably brought from
Mexico by many of the settlers. Agaves still
abound around La Bahia today.
Many kinds of agaves, yuccas, and sot61s have
hearts rich in starch and sugars. Mature plants are
pried out of the ground with an iron bar and the
leaves chopped off with a machete. The hearts
(pifias) are baked in an earth oven, chopped into
pieces, and fermented in wooden vats in the ground
(Tunnell and Madrid 1988:154).

After several days of fermenting, the juice
(caldo) is placed in a spherical copper per61 of
about 400-600 liters capacity and boiled over a
hot fire (Figure 13). A section of hollow log
(pipote) is sealed on top of the per6l with mash
and catches the steam. A tube (serpentina) of
copper or cane carries the steam through a cooling
vat and liquor drips from the end of the tube. The
product of the first distillation is called "vino" and
contains impurities which can cause headache and
hangover. After draining and cleaning of the per61,
a second distillation of the vino produces a much
finer and stronger liquor. Fragments of green glass
bottles are found on most Spanish sites in Texas,
and liquor could have been kept in these or even
in glazed clay bottles and pitchers.
Liquor not only served as an intoxicating beverage on this remote frontier, but it was also an
important medication for many illnesses. Efficacy
of the alcohol as medication was likely enhanced
by the addition of various herbs (Tunnell and
Madrid 1988:159). In 1768, Fray Jose de Solfs
reported that excellent peaches and figs were harvested in large quantities by the neophytes at Mission Espiritu Santo (Castaneda 1939:32). Soaking

of these fruits in the distilled liquor could produce
good quality brandy.
Hypotheses concerning the per61:
1. That since the per61 was found buried near
Mission Espiritu Santo, the chore of making
alcohol at La Bahia may have fallen to the
neophytes;
2. That the sale of alcohol as a beverage and
medication to the presidia! troops and villagers across the river, would have provided some
income for the church. Lt. Hardy ( 1977), traveling in the Chihuahuan desert in 1825, said
that two small stills brought a profit of thirty
dollars a day throughout the year;
3. That an overdue debt of 400 pesos owed to
the church by presidial Commander Manuel
Espadas, was settled by Captain Cortes in 1797
(Castaneda 1942: 180). Perhaps this was a bill
for liquor rations secured from the mission;
and
4. That when the mission was finally secularized
in 1830, the departing priest had the parishioners bury the old per61 and fragments of two

bronze cannons which had been intended as
bell metal, between the mission and the river.

ABSTRACT
This article presents historical, archival, and artifactual evidence supporting the belief that the Tonkawa
Bank site (41VTI0), located in the Victoria City Park, Victoria, Texas, is the second location of the Mission
Espfritu Santo de Zuniga. This mission, originally founded in 1721 on Garcitas Creek in current-day Jackson
County, was relocated to the Guadalupe River sometime prior to 1725. The site, listed on the National Register
of Historic Places in 1981, is significant from a local, areal, regional, and state-wide perspective.

INTRODUCTION

Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. The site
consists of both a prehistoric and historical
component. The historical component consists of
the stone foundation footings of a two-room
rectangular structure, measuring ca. 25 x 40 feet on
the exterior (Figures 1 and 2). The footings are
constructed of stream-rolled chert gravels, caliche/

Site 41VT10, known as the Tonkawa Bank
site, is currently recognized as a visita of the Mission
Espfritu Santo de Zuniga. Located within the
Victoria City Park, the site, listed on the National
Register of Historic Places in 1981, also is a

1932:3). As early as 1883, John Linn, who settled
in Victoria in 1829, noted:
The Toncahuas were located at or near
Victoria, their field being above the site
of the present town. They had a church,
which was erected on what is now known
as "the Toncahua Bank," the foundation
of which is still visible, as it was built of
masonry (Linn 1883:333-334).

sandstone cobbles and mortar, with an original width
of one vara (33.3 inches). Surface artifacts on the
site cover an area approximately 240 x 300 feet,
with concentrations of artifacts located well to the
south of the existing foundations.
Archival research (Hindes 1995:8-9, 28) and
archeological field work indicates that the site more
accurately may be the second location (see Hester
1995:6, Endnote 1) of the Mission Espiritu Santo
de Zuniga, moved from its first location on Garcitas
Creek in ca. 1725. This mission and its corresponding Presidio Nuestra Senora del Loreto were originally founded by the Spanish on Garcitas Creek in
1721, although not officially dedicated by Aguayo
until 1722 (Patron 1722). The Presidio Nuestra
Senora del Loreto was established on the site of La
Salle's Ft. St Louis (Gilmore 1973).
The documentary data regarding an additional
location for the Mission Espiritu Santo de Zuniga
was uncovered during historical and archival research conducted in 1994-1995 (Hindes 1994). This
research was begun prior to field surveys initiated
in 1994 and currently ongoing to locate the first site
of the mission. Although the later locations of the
mission (as well as the Presidio Nuestra Senora del
Loreto) were not of primary interest during the
original studies, a review of all aspects of mission
development and history was necessary to understand the mission's founding.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The site was a Tonkawa Indian site when
Martin de Leon founded Victoria in 1824 (Jarratt

Linn's information regarding the site may have
come from a Tonkawa Indian named "Joe" who
lived in Victoria during the time that Linn also
resided there (Linn 1883:333-334). According to
Linn, the Tonkawa manufactured blankets, cultivated corn and vegetables, and owned cattle and
horses (Linn 1883:333-334). However, only a remnant of the tribe was left as of the early to mid-19th
century (Linn 1883:333-334).
The first mission on Garcitas Creek had been
founded primarily for the Cocos, Curacames, and
Cujames (Karankawa) Indians (Patron 1722). The
relocated mission was established for the
Aranama (Almazan 1726; Bustillo 1726), who
had petitioned Governor Alarcon for a mission
as early as 1718 (Celiz 1935:67). However, by
the early to mid-19th century, at which time Linn
had settled in the Victoria area, the Tonkawa
resided here.
John Jarratt first became aware of the
archeological aspects of the site in 1922 when he
discovered a human arm bone partly exposed in
an area of a mott of trees located on the southern
portions of the site (the prehistoric component),
as well as chert flakes, shell, and animal bone
(Jarratt 1932: 1). These deposits had been exposed
by soil borrowing activities conducted by "Doc
Hiller," the owner of "Hiller's Mott," as the site
was then known. The stone ruins were found on
top of the thick mesquite and huisache brushcovered ridge (Figure 3) (Jarratt 1932:2). In 19301931, Jarratt investigated the "Indian Village"
(or burial ground) located ca. 1000 feet south of
the stone ruins (Jarratt 1966b:l). He additionally
placed a "test hole two feet deep by two feet
wide ... 300 feet from the river and on top of the
hill" (Jarratt 1932:3). At this location, Jarratt
found a "volcanic rock matate [sic] of Mexican
origin" (Jarratt 1932:3). The 1930 excavations
revealed the following regarding the historical
component:

Hindes, Fox, and Schmiedlin- Test Excavations and Research at the Tonkawa Bank Site

Figure 3. Site 41VT10 prior to bulldozing by city.
Much pottery and various types of flint
implements such as manos, points, scrapers, grinders, etc. were found-much of
it on the surface among the brush that
covered the whole ridge at that time. Here
also Spanish artifacts are much in evidence in the form of broken metates and
manos of Mal-pie and volcanic materials, and Majolica pottery potsherds.
Tests ... on the ridge showed kitchen
midden from 8 to 12 inches deep and
saturated through with all sorts of potsherds, Indian and Spanish, flint, dart and
arrow points, bones, burned rocks, and in
some places charcoal to a depth of 2 feet
(Jarratt 1966a:4-5).
Jarratt forwarded artifacts, notes, and drawings to the Smithsonian Institution, and on April
24, 1931, Dr. Frank M. Setzler of the Smithsonian
traveled to Victoria (Jarratt 1932: 11). Both the south
slope (and Indian burial ground area), as well as the
north slope (in the area of the stone ruins), were
inspected (Jarratt 1932: 11 ).
J. E. Pearce of the University of Texas at Austin visited the site in early 1932 (Jarratt 1932: 12).
Pearce, later that same year, sent A. M. Woolsey of
the University of Texas at Austin and some students to conduct investigations at the Tonkawa Bank
site as well as at other sites in the Victoria area
(Jarratt 1932:12). Woolsey worked two days at the
prehistoric component (Woolsey n.d.; Jarratt
1966b). He did not investigate the historical component at the site (Jarratt 1932: 12).
In 1965, Jarratt, with a small number of volunteers including George Hobbs, a 15-year-old high

81

school student, returned to the Tonkawa Bank site,
this time concentrating his efforts at the stone ruins
(Figure 4a-b ). He excavated and mapped what remained of the ruins on the site, which he had observed there originally in 1922, before the City of
Victoria bulldozed about two feet off the top of the
ridge in 1958. Jarratt maintained that the walls had
been standing three feet high as late as 1922 (Jarratt
1966a:6). He found a two-room stone building partially surrounded by a stone wall on the north, east,
and south. Artifacts he recovered included majolica
and Indian pottery sherds as well as other Spanish
artifacts. Mr. Des Hiller, who as a boy played around
the old foundations, stated that:
...the large door to the building faced
west or toward the river.. ./and the walls/
... were about 5 feet high in places, and
had a lot of Windows or what could of
been windows, they were very small and
looked more like slots left in the wall for
some reason ... (Jarratt 1966c:6-7).

These openings were probably troneras (gun ports)
commonly found in early structures on the sides of
the doors and windows for defensive purposes (Graham 1994:26). Because of the threat of Indian attack, the earliest structures had few if any windows
(Juarez 1976:21).
By 1965, the stone ruins were about six inches
below the surface (Jarratt 1966b:7-9). The foundations, "made of limestone or sandstone rock, were
two feet in width" (Jarratt 1966b:7-9). Jarratt reported that a layer of yellow sand had been placed
in a prepared trench that was then filled with river
gravel and rock and cemented into a solid mass.
The stone ruins measured 40 feet on the north side,
42 feet on the south side, and 25 feet in width. The
west end on the south side had an extension of two
feet. The main door was located in the west elevation. The building was divided into two rooms by a
partition wall, also two feet in width, with a fire
place in the front room. Buttresses were noted at
each comer (Jarratt 1966b:7-9).
The layer of sand was ca. three inches in depth
placed
directly on clay (Jarratt l 966c:6). Once
and
these foundations reached what Jarratt considered
the ground surface, the sandstone walls began with
"some gravel being used as filling, with the exception of the comers and where the buttress/es/ were
located... " (Jarratt 1966c:6). The floor was made of
a Iimestone-caliche while the walls were plastered
(Jarratt l 966a:6).
Jarratt also found "the outline traces of other
old foundations" near where he encountered three
historic burials (Jarratt l 966c:5). Additionally,
Jarratt found evidence of a third room attached to
the southeast comer of the two-room structure that
he believed may have served as a kitchen. Indian
pottery, majolica, burned rock, fragments of an old
iron pot, animal bones, and shells were found here
(Jarratt l 966c:7). To the west of the two-room structure he found a trace of a rock wall with a lot of
"burned clay and sand, fragments of baked clay,
charcoal...Indian pottery ... and some pottery that had
been glazed ... clam and mussel, shell, and flint chipping ... " (Jarratt 1966c:8).
In September 1965, Jarratt located three burials ca. 60 feet south of the stone ruins (Jarratt
1966b:3), or 36 feet southeast from the old foundation wall (Jarratt 1966c:5). All three burials had
been exposed by heavy equipment being driven
over the area in wet weather (Jarratt 1966a:7), and
were "badly crushed and broken" (Jarratt 1966c:7).

Burial No. l was "exposed so much that it was
taken up" (Jarratt 1966b:3):
The skull was all broken and crushed as I
were/ the other bones of the skeleton,
however, a complete Jaw bone with the
teeth still intact was in good condition,
the burial was all removed as to [sic]
much of it was showing above ground, I
did not want anyone digging around the
area and find/ing/ the other graves, these
I want to excavate with an Anthropologist present when they are taken up .. .In
the grave excavated, was found with the
skeleton were scraps of old Iron so badly
rusted away that nothing could be made
of it, also found was a fragment of Braid
made of Copper Silver and Brass thread
(This I identified as Spanish by comparison with similar braid found at the
Espiritu Santo Mission site and at La
Bahia at Goliad), and could be off of a
Spanish Priest Vestments or from a Spanish Officers Coat of the Early 18th Century. A peace [sic] oflead was also found
at this burial, as was a small fragment of
Majolica ware...My opinion of this grave
yard is that it is Spanish, as the burials
face East, and are straight burials, where
as the burials that I found in 1930 in the
Indian burying ground South of this location /were/ all flexed or bundle burials
(Jarratt 1966c:8).
Police Capt. Kenneth Rosenquest, another policeman, and Mr. Herman Fishbeck witnessed the excavation (Jarratt 1966b:3).
On November 24 and December 28, 1965,
Jarratt also reported finding "some human bones
(ribs) south of rock wall...The remains of an Iron
pot 8 in. down ... the bones and the pot /were/ left
over night inside a fence, but /were/ stolen during
the night" (Jarratt l 966b: 10). It is not clear if these
remains were from the same original three individuals or different burials.
On May 27, 1966, Jarratt began the excavation
of the second burial at the site. This burial, fully
extended with the hands folded across the breast,
faced east (Jarratt 1966b:20-21). Two amber glass
beads and approximately three pink "chalk" beads
were found near the neck. Based on the presence of
fragments of nails and "rusty streaks," Jarratt

Hindes, Fox, and Schmiedlin -

Test Excavations and Research at the Tonkawa Bank Site

believed the body to have been placed in a coffin
about two-and-one-half or three feet deep (Jarratt
1966b:20-21). Since evidence of a "fire pit" and
Indian ceramic sherds were encountered 12 inches
below the burials, Jarratt believed that the burials
had been placed within/over an Indian occupation
level (Jarratt 1966a:7).
In the spring of 1978, E. H. Schmiedlin
excavated a row of 11 auger tests across the site.
He recovered additional artifacts similar to those
found by Jarratt and the tests suggested that the site
continued to the south of the ruins.
At the request of Jack Murphy, Director of
Parks and Recreation for the City of Victoria, archeologists from the Center for Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio
(CAR-UTSA) monitored test trenching at the park
site in November 1978 (Fox 1979). The purpose of
the project was to determine the extent of the site
so that future park development in the form of a
rose garden to the west of the site would be sure
not to disturb it. Two narrow perpendicular
trenches were machine-excavated across the area
directly south of the ruins, as suggested by the results of Schmiedlin' s auger tests. All artifacts
brought up in the backdirt of the machine were

I

flagged and mapped in place. The resulting site
map depicts the extent of the site (Figure 5). This
estimate was reached by mapping the extent of the
artifact scatter recorded by these two efforts, in
relation to the overall map of the site. Artifacts
were concentrated near the crossing of the two
trenches, and gradually diminished toward the
west, south, and east.
In May 1989, at the request of Parks and
Recreation Director Paul Locher, Dan Potter from
the CAR-UTSA conducted a survey and shovel
testing of the area directly to the east of the colonial site. The area had been the location of the
Jaycee Hall and parking lot. The hall had been
removed down to the concrete slab, and the area
was slated to become a children's playground.
Potter found no evidence of archeological sites of
any kind within the survey area, which approached
to within 25 m of the estimated eastern edge of the
colonial site.
In September 1996, limited testing and mapping operations were conducted at the Tonkawa
Bank site by the authors under Antiquities Permit
No. 1733 issued to Dr. Thomas R. Hester. These
investigations extended the testing to the east and
south in order to positively confirm the limits of the

site, in particular, whether the mission site extended
beyond the south boundary into the Hiller property
(Figure 6a-b).
Test units were placed in selected areas to
determine the presence or absence of additional
features (particularly in the southern third of the
site area where earthmoving activities were believed
to not have as severely impacted deposits). A reanalysis of artifacts from the site was also undertaken, and included collections placed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin (TARL), CAR-UTSA, as

well as a number of private collections.
While the 1978 testing appeared to show the
artifact densities decreasing at the east and south
ends of the test trenches, neither trench showed
totally convincing evidence that sterile soil had been
reached beyond where the trenches stopped. Relocating the original trenches was complicated by the
numerous changes in the area between 1978 and
1996. The ruins had been completely covered with
topsoil and overgrown with grass, so that only an
occasional top of a stone could be seen. The fence
that had surrounded the ruins had been removed,
leaving only the historical marker still in place. The
entire area was hip-deep in grass, except for the
area immediately around the ruins.
The location of the 1978 test trenches was
reestablished, using a transit, from an accurate map
of the site done at that time. The east and south
extensions of the trenches were staked out, measuring from the point where the trenches had crossed.
To the east (Trench B), shovel tests were dug to
sterile soil every five feet along the original line,
but beyond the point where testing had stopped in
1978. Contrary to the original estimate, artifacts
were present more than 30 feet beyond the end of
the original trench. Artifacts were found from six
inches to 30 inches below the present surface, and
there was no sign of a Spanish colonial occupation
surface. In order to more closely examine the stratification of the soils in this area, one half of a threefoot-square unit was excavated in six-inch levels,
screening all soil removed. The soil was identified
as Beaumont Clay, which cracks badly in dry
weather, allowing artifacts to fall deeply into the
subsoil. Ironically, this condition allowed the limits
of the original artifact scatter on the site to be established in spite of the later removal of up to two
feet of soil.
To the south of Trench A, approximately 40
feet lay between the end of the trench and the boundary fence at the top of the rise. Shovel tests were
placed every ten feet beyond the end of the 1978
trenches. In this area, shovel tests were excavated
to sterile soil every five feet, extending 40 feet to
the fence and 40 feet beyond. This work clearly
established the relationship between the historic site
and the prehistoric site on the Hiller land to the
south. There was no sign of artifacts of any age in
these tests, which extended across the storage lot,
across the boundary between this park land and the
Hiller property to the south, and several ten foot

Hindes, Fox, and Schmiedlin -

intervals into the Hiller property.
To the west of Trench B (see Figure 5), sufficient testing had been done, particularly since the
installation of the Rose Garden did not encounter
significant evidence of ruins or numerous artifacts,
unlike the intersection of the test trenches. To the
east of Trench B, the main artifact concentration
approached the end of the test trench and additional
shovel tests were placed here to determine if any
further remains extended in this direction. This was
particularly important given the location of the burials observed in the 1960s by Mr. Jarratt farther to
the north. These shovel tests, 15 inches in diameter,
were executed in the same manner as those done by
CAR-UTSA at Mission San Jose in 1993 (Hard et
al. 1995). This entailed recording soil changes as
they were discovered, changing the levels at each
soil change, excavating to sterile soil, screening all
soil removed, and bagging the artifacts by provenience for later analysis.
Portions of the foundation footings visible to
the eye as well as those located by ground probing
with a metal rod were flagged and found to measure approximately 25 x 50 feet. A photographic
record of what was visible above the ground was
made to complete our investigations.

IDSTORICAL AND ARCIDVAL
RESEARCH
Abandonment of the first mission and presidio
locations on Garcitas Creek was considered as
early as April 15, 1725. On April 1, 1726, Juan
Antonio Bustillo, Captain of the Presidio, selected
and surveyed a site on the Guadalupe River for the
new presidio. After a delay of almost a year from
the time first considered for the move, Fernando
Perez de Almazan, the Governor of Texas, finally
approved the site surveyed earlier by Bustillo. We
do not yet know exactly when the mission was
moved from Garcitas Creek; however, it was at its
new location by April 1, 1726. Two of the three
priests assigned to the mission had died by 1725:
Fray Ignacio Baena (or Bahena) in 1725 and Fray
Diego Zapata in 1723 (Leutenegger and Habig
1973:111). Word of the death of Fray Baena
reached Zacatecas in March 1725. In 1729, his remains were taken to Zacatecas and interred in the
cemetery at the college (Leutenegger and Habig
1973: 111). Only Fray Agustfn Patron remained at

85

the mission, and we can surmise that Patron, afflicted with a "horrible disease of running sores"
(Ramsdell 1963:6), was eager to find a more suitable location. He also wanted to find more receptive neophytes. The presidio was not moved until
after August 29, 1726.
Bustillo wrote on June 18, 1726 (emphasis the
authors'):
.. .I showed him (Almazan) a place on the
banks of the Guadalupe River, about five
leagues from here a little more or less. It
is a place that I had previously noted for
this purpose on the same river.. .In the
cited mail of September 2nd, I had recommended the site of the ranch; however
I had not seen this site, which is of greater
extension, ...With the referred to advantages induding a creek at a quarter of a
league, where I have built an irrigation
outlet for a mission and the Father Missionary there is attending to the planting
and is working to recruit Indians from
the Jaraname nation... They are a nation
that is spread far and wide, so that to
gather them together it will be necessary
to place another Mission, at the large
creek that I reconnoitered on the new
road that I opened going to the Rio
Grande. This site is located about three
leagues from the place selected for the
presidia.

Almazan, who accompanied Bustillo, to inspect the site chosen by Bustillo, wrote on July 4,
1726 (emphasis the authors'):
.. .I went to the presidio and carefully
reconnoitered the area. A site was found
six leagues to the northwest on the bank
of the Guadalupe river. It has the advantage of being on high ground ... at a distance of less than a league ... there is a
creek of sweet water. ..It is sufficient easily for a furrow and a half of water for
farming land and to congregate some
Indians in a mission, ... whose acequia is
already being dug ... Later I was given to
understand that there has been discovered on this side of the river, at a distance of three leagues, another arroyo
with abundant waters and sufficient
lands for a copious mission that could

86

provide crops to supply the presidia.

Bustillo reported the distance of the location
chosen for the new presidio to be about five leagues
poco mas o menos from the old presidio. Almazan
stated that the distance was six leagues. The mission location (in relation to the site selected for the
presidio ), where the Mission fathers had established
themselves and begun an acequia, is noted in both
documents: Bustillo reports 1/4 league while
Almazan recorded it as "less than a league." By
extrapolation, the second mission location was 5
1/4 leagues (13.80 miles) to less than 7 leagues (18.41
miles) from the first presidio on Garcitas creek.
Father Habig believed the second location of
the mission "could not possibly have been the Mission Valley site" (Habig 1969), but rather, was near
Bloomington, or "near (or in) Victoria" (Habig
1983). Jarratt believed that the distances mentioned
in translations indicated that the priests had settled
at the Tonkawa (Toncahua) Bank (Jarratt 1967: 10).
Jarratt identified eight Spanish colonial sites for the
Victoria County Historical Society in 1968. He produced a rough map showing the eight locations
(Jarratt 1968). Jarratt's Site No. 3 is identified as
the "Second site of Mission Senora del Espfritu
Santo de Zuniga." This site is the Tonkawa Bank
site (41 VTlO) currently identified by an official
Texas Historical Marker as the visita of the mission. Jarratt also identified the Mission Valley site
as the "third location" (Jarratt 1968).
Most importantly, Almazan and Bustillo stated
that the location selected for a larger mission (than
the one already present on the Guadalupe River)
was at a large creek three leagues distant from the
site chosen for the presidio. By taking the extrapolated distances for the mission in relation to the site
selected for the presidio, one arrives at five and
one-fourth leagues (13.80 miles) to less than seven
leagues (less than 18.41 miles). This would put the
sites in the Victoria area, far short of the Mission
Valley location. By adding the three leagues (7.89
miles) that both Bustillo and Almazan tell us was
the place then chosen for the larger mission, we get
a distance of 21.04-26.30 miles. The distance from
41 VT4, the site of the Presidio Nuestra Senora de
Loreto on Garcitas Creek, to the Victoria City Park
area is approximately 20.5 miles. The 26.30 miles
is fairly close to the approximate distance of 27.8
miles from the Presidio Nuestra Senora de Loreto
on Garcitas Creek to 41VT11 (the Mission Valley

site; see Walter 1997). Additionally, the three
leagues (or 7.89 miles) given as the distance between the second (interim) site and the Mission
Valley site closely matches the 7.61 miles between
Victoria (as measured from the Tonkawa Bank site)
and 41VT11.

MATERIAL CULTURE
The following descriptions include the artifacts recovered in test excavations (Table 1) as well
as all other known/available collections from the
site (Table 2). These come from various sources:
the artifacts recovered by Mr. Jarratt, and placed at
TARL; the CAR-UTSA 1978 project; and
Schmiedlin's collections from the surface and from
his auger tests. Due to the irregularity of the sampling used, no attempt will be made to read significance into the numbers or proportions of artifacts
recovered, limiting this article to descriptions. Additionally, the following descriptions do not include
all artifacts recovered from the site by Mr. Jarratt,
including some of those which are curated at T ARL.
For example, a number of the lithic artifacts as well
as the human skeletal remains have not been included in this report. Due to the constraints of the
project, only diagnostic artifacts were examined
that could contribute to our understanding of the
age of the Spanish colonial remains at the site.

Ceramics
Probably the most useful artifacts for identifying and dating a historic site are the ceramic sherds.
Fashions in ceramic patterns have changed with
some regularity, making them excellent time markers. In addition, we are able to identify locations or
cultural groups from which most of the ceramics on
Spanish colonial sites came.

Goliad W a:re

Unglazed ceramics make up the second largest
portion of the ceramic sherds from the Tonkawa
Bank site. This is inconsistent with other Spanish
colonial sites, in which the unglazed ceramics
constitute the highest percentage of ceramic sherds.
The majority of the sherds are from bone-tempered,
hand-built vessels currently referred to as Goliad

ware (Figure 7). Probably made by the Aranama in
this case, they are also found on colonial sites
elsewhere in the Victoria area, and range as far
north as the San Antonio missions as well, where
they are thought to have been made by other South
Texas Indian groups. The Aranama women
"manufactured cloth, and also waterjars used by
themselves" (Linn 1883:336). Identical sherds have
been excavated from Late Prehistoric sites in South
Texas, suggesting a long continuity of this ceramic
type (Ivey and Fox 1981:31). Two of the sherds
illustrated are portions of vessel handles (see Figure

Unglazed Sandy Paste Ware
Also present on this site are a smaller number
of unglazed, sandy paste sherds (see Figure 7a) that
resemble coastal Rockport ware in color and texture,
but their average thickness (7-8 mm) is greater than
that of Rockport ware (5-6 mm). A number of these
sherds also bear traces of what may once have been
an immature lead glaze. Most of the sherds contain

what appear to be shell inclusions for binder. The
uniformity of the paste firing appears to suggest
that these sherds may have been fired in some sort
of kiln. Similar sherds were excavated by the T AS
Field School at 41 VT8 in Mission Valley north of
Victoria in 1968, and were also documented by
Mounger (1959) from the mission site at Goliad,
Texas. More study and analysis of this ceramic
type is overdue. It does not appear in the San
Antonio missions.

Burnished Wares
Two types of unglazed burnished ceramics are
customarily found on Texas colonial sites. One has a
red paste (Figure Sa) and matte designs on a burnished background (Gilmore 1974:63). The othei.: with
a tan paste has been identified as Tonala Burnished
Ware (Figure 8b) made in Jalisco (Ivey and Fox
1981:31, 34). The illustrated sherd is from the base of
a small vessel. A few sherds of these
two ceramic types are in the Jarratt
and Schmiedlin collections. One
sherd can be identified as a fragment of a small novelty figurine
produced in Tonala, Mexico during
the 18th century (Deagan 1987:4446). Also known as Guadalajara
Polychrome (Deagan 1987:44-46),
bowls, lidded bowls, and the novelty figurines were most popular in
the first half of the 18th century
(Deagan 1987:46).

glazed ceramic sherds has been collected from this
site. Most have a sandy paste with glazes varying
from clear to yellow to dark green. Several sherds
appear to be decorated with green designs (see Figure 8c) and all are wheel-turned. A few of the
sherds have incised and/or engraved lines on the
exteriors. In comparison with lead glazed wares
recovered from slightly later mission sites on the
San Antonio River from Goliad to San Antonio
(Fox 1974:56), these are more crudely made and
often under-fired so that the glaze has failed to
completely mature. They vary in thickness from 513 mm. Identical sherds were found at 41 VT8 in
1968.
Two sherds with a fine-textured, creamy beige
paste have a yellow glaze and brown under-glaze
decoration (see Fox [1974:58] for a description of
similar sherds from Mission Rosario in Goliad). A
preliminary analysis of several of these sherds allow us to make some general comments on vessel
forms as attributes of size and function. A small
number of the sherds are basal sections of flatbottomed vessels with a slightly flaring to straightsided bodies (see Figure 8f-g). These appear to
represent storage jars or containers, or flat-bottomed
bowls. Two sherds (see Figure 8h) of a fine textured paste form the ringed basal portion of a small
vessel, probably a jar.

A few sherds with a fine-textured red orange paste and brown
and cream designs under a clear
lead glaze (see Figure 8k) represent a type called Galera Ware
across the Southwest (Fox
1974:57-58). The interesting point
to be made about the presence of
these sherds on this site is that the
type has been generally accepted
as not reaching the Texas frontier
until ca. 1750 (Ivey and Fox
1981:34). If this date is accurate,
it would appear that the Tonkawa
Bank site may have continued in
use at least until about the time that
the Mission Valley mission and
presidio were moved to the San Antonio River in 1749.

Olive Jar
Several sherds of heavy wheel-thrown jars with
green glaze (see Figure 8e) represent the only olive
jar fragments from this site. Nearly always present
on 18th century Texas sites, these storage vessels
are indicators of a Spanish presence.

Majolicas
A ceramic type called majolica bears a lead
glaze to which tin was added to produce a white
background for bright-colored decoration. The sherds
recovered from this site are nearly all too small to
identify the numerous varieties that are useful to
archeologists for dating deposits. However, several
sherds from Tonkawa Bank correspond to majolica
patterns found at sites in Mission Valley.
Puebla Polychrome (Figure 9a-c), made in
Puebla, Mexico, has blue geometric designs interlaced with black cobweb-like lines. It is generally
found on sites occupied in the last half of the 17th
century and the first quarter of the 18th century
(Deagan 1987:82). Seventeen of the identifiable
sherds fit this type. This represents 36 percent of
the total, by far the majority of the majolica sherds
from this site. Carlson's (1994) study of ceramic

assemblages from six 18th century Spanish colonial mission sites in Texas identified only two sherds
of Puebla Polychrome ceramics, both of these from
Mission Dolores de los Afs (41SA25).
Abo Polychrome Type B/Aranama covers a
confusing group of patterns that have yet to be
sorted out (see Figure 9d-f). These types have an
orange band encircling the rim and "gaily painted
floral and animal designs in yellow, orange,
green-blue, and brown" (Deagan 1987:79). For
the moment we are lumping these together even
though the combined dating-AM to the last half
of the 17th century and into the early 18th
century, and Aranama to the last half of the 18th
century-is not in any way helpful. As an
example of this confusion, the polychrome sherds
from this site all appear to fall into a variety that
Ronald May in California has named Quiburi
Polychrome (Barnes and May 1972:35) and dated
1770 to 1800, yet in Spanish sites in Texas this
type seems to be contemporary with Puebla
Polychrome, as it is here. A total of nine sherds
from Tonkawa Bank can be typed to this category.
This represents 19 percent of the total documented tin-glazed majolicas. Ongoing analysis
of collections from two sites know to be
associated with Presidio La Bahfa (41 VT8 and
41GD7) will attempt to help solve this problem,
since presidia! sites are known to produce

proportionately more majolica than mission sites
(Goggin 1968:223; Fontana 1973:12).
Puebla Blue on White (see Figure 9g) consists of one or more shades of blue in a wide
rim band, below this a narrower band, and suspended from this is a row of single petals alternating with whole blossoms. In the center is a
flower, a long-legged bird, or a deer (Goggin
1968:191). It is contemporary with Puebla
Polychrome.
Puebla Blue on White II (see Figure 9h) is a
variation of Blue on White whose decoration appears only on the exterior of cups and bowls. The
design consists of numerous horizontal parallel light
blue lines dotted with darker blue petals (Tunnell
1966:8; Seifert 1977:186). It dates to the last half of
the 18th century.
One sherd of an unnamed variety (see Figure
9i) bears a form of decoration seen only in the
collections of Presidio La Bahfa at Goliad (41GD7).
On the larger sherds, pale blue, orange, yellow, and
pale green elements are surrounded by very thin
brown/black lines with the usual amount of creamy
white background exposed, giving a light, airy appearance. Other sherds of this variety include a
yellow rim band with one brown/black line above
and two below (see Figure 9d), identifying it as a
member of the Ab6/Aranama family.
Metal
The back half of a compound copper/brass
button (Figure lOa) was found at the site by Mr.
Jarratt. A loop is brazed to the back, which tends to
date the button to the late 18th to early 19th century. This may not be a Spanish colonial button.
Mr. Jarratt also found a 4-inch-long, wormshaped piece of lead (see Figure lOc), the purpose
for which is unknown. An unidentified metal object was also in the Jarratt collection (see Figure
lOb ), along with a number of fragments of badly
rusted iron.
Eight fragments of thin sheet copper came
from the site (see Figure lOd-h). All of these appear
to have been cut from a larger object, perhaps to
repair a cooking pot. Two of the fragments are
elongate (see Figure 1Od) with shapely pointed
and tapered ends. One lug fragment (see Figure
IOf) has a rivet hole where the handle would have
been attached to the pot. Repaired copper pots

not have recognized these as worth
saving, but the archeologists habitually collect them.

Beads

A bead made from the columella
of a conch shell (see Figure 1 ld) is in
the Jarratt collection. Such beads are
not uncommon on historic period Indian sites, probably in this case indicating trade between the Aranama and
coastal groups.
Three pink clay beads, only two of
which remain in the collection (see Figure l le) were found by Mr. Jarratt near

the clay. Additionally, a natural source
of drying would be the sun, baking the
clay much like sun-dried adobe bricks

many more such burned daub fragments
on the surface when Mr. Jarratt first
made his collections from the site, but
he would not have recognized them as
important enough to save.

contain eight to ten irregular facets (Deagan
1987: 178-179). They most commonly represent rosary beads (Deagan 1987: 159).

Pipe
A white clay pipe stem fragment (see Figure
1 lg) of probable European origin is among the
Jarratt artifacts. Similar fragments have been found
at Mission Concepcion (Krueger and Meskill
1992:23) in 19th century deposits. Although such
pipes were made as early as the 18th century, pipe
smoking did not come into fashion in Texas until
the arrival of the Anglo-Americans and Germans in
the early 19th century.

Chert
Of the 27 chert fragments recovered during
the excavations, three are identifiable as gun flints
(see Figure l lh-j). They are quite different in shape
and are made from three distinctly different colors
of chert. All appear to be locally made.
Animal Bone
The fragments of bone recovered from the two
excavation projects were nearly all splinters and
fragments too small to identify as to species.

Other
The Jarratt collection at TARL also includes
"a fragment of Braid made of Copper Silver and
Brass thread" (Jarratt n.d.:8). This fragment was
found in association with burial No. 1. Due to the
fragile condition of this artifact, it was not removed
for analysis.

SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
The Tonkawa Bank site contains the remains
of stone ruins and other features dating to the Spanish colonial period. Although a tremendous amount
of modification activities have taken place at the
site within the last 40 years, "the fact that Jarratt
could still locate wall footings suggests that there
are probably more structural remains present even

where topsoil removal was most severe" (Fox
1979:6). Infrared photographs taken of the site in
1997 appear to show several distinct anomalies in
the southeastern portions of the site where our
shovel tests were located; these may represent
jacals. If so, some subsurface evidence of these
structures must exist or be intact enough to be detected by remote sensing techniques.
The 1996 investigations at Tonkawa Bank
revealed that the site limits originally proposed
by the 1978 work were substantially valid. The
eastern site limits extended approximately 30 feet
past the 1978 margins. Testing to the south of the
original limits of the site showed that the site
does not extend into the city storage area or into
the Hiller property. Revised estimates of the site
limits based on a surface and subsurface artifactual scatter of approximately 240 feet by 300 feet
is consistent with other known and documented
mission sites.
Based on the statistically significant presence
of certain tin-glazed ceramic sherds, of which the
largest majority (36 percent) are Puebla Polychrome (e.g., Deagan 1987:29, 82), an initial occupation date of 1725 (or earlier) can be
established for the Tonkawa Bank site. This date
corresponds directly with the archival data, supporting the hypothesis that this site is the second
site of Mission Espiritu Santo de Zuniga. Based
on distances given in the archival records, the
second location of the mission could not have
been the Mission Valley site (41VT11). The exact
date for the removal of the mission from the
Garcitas Creek location is not currently known,
but it is clear that the mission had already relocated prior to the official permission of the Spanish authorities, and before the relocation of the
presidio. The site remained in use throughout the
first half of the 18th century. We do not yet know
when, or if, the Tonkawa Bank site ceased to exist
as a "formal" mission after the construction of the
third and larger mission site (41VT11), but archival data supports a contemporary occupation. The
date of the relocation and reburial of Father Baena
to Zacatecas may help to clarify this increasingly
complex series of removals and relocations. Thus,
based on material culture as well as retranslations
and reanalysis of primary source documents, the
site appears to represent a much more substantial
mission location than that of a visita (Fox 1979)
or an interim location (Hindes 1995).

Hindes, Fox, and Schmiedlin -

Test Excavations and Research at the Tonkawa Bank Site

The artifactual material and its similarity to
the ceramics from the mission and presidio sites at
Mission Valley indicate that the sites were all occupied during the same time period. An important
conclusion that is suggested by the analysis of ceramics at the Victoria Park site is that this site must
have continued in use right up to the time that site
41VT11 (the Mission Valley site) and 41VT8 (the
presidio site) were moved to the San Antonio River
in 1749. This is based on the presence of Galera
Ware, which did not appear in Texas until the midl 8th century, and Puebla Blue on White II majolica, also thought to date to the last half of the
18th century. Indeed, artifactual material located in
several collections (not included in this article)
found over a large area of Tonkawa Bank, but away
from the main Spanish colonial occupation, suggests an historical occupation dating from ca. 1725
to the mid-19th century.
To recapitulate, archival documents consulted
so far, then, suggest that the mission was removed
from Garcitas Creek sometime prior to 1725 to the
Victoria City Park area, and was actively occupied
by the mission fathers prior to the removal of the
presidio from Garcitas Creek. Because of the great
numbers of Aranama Indians, a third mission site
was selected at the Mission Valley location and
was also established and occupied contemporaneously with the Tonkawa Bank site for a period of
time. Artifactual material correlates with the archival documentation and suggests that the site was
definitely occupied through the first half of the
18th century, or until the time that both the missions and presidios were removed to the San Antonio River at current Goliad, Texas.
Documentary evidence and material culture remains thus point to four mission sites. The first site
on Garcitas Creek is yet unlocated (Hindes and
Mallouf n.d.). The second site was apparently in
the immediate area of present-day Victoria at the
Tonkawa Bank site. The next location was at
41VT11, where the University of Texas at Austin
field school conducted investigations in 1996 and
the 1997 and 1998 TAS Field School was held, and
the fourth and final site is at Goliad.

and we are grateful for his support and interest.
As always, Kathleen Gilmore listened to the
ideas of the senior author and read drafts of working papers dealing with the history of the mission
and presidio, made recommendations, and analyzed
the validity of the hypothesis regarding an additional site for the mission. It was Kathleen who
initially encouraged the same author to publish this
data, even though, it was not, at the time, accepted
by many professional archeologists and historians.
Dr. Thomas R. Hester, Director, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas
at Austin, offered support and encouragement regarding the archival studies. Tom served as Principal Investigator and tactfully challenged the senior
author to initially publish the work, and provided the
format through the Friends of TARL Newsletter.

Excavations in Area A at Mission Espiritu
Santo de Zuniga (41 VTll),
Victoria County, Texas
Tamra L. Walter

ABSTRACT
The third location of Mission Espiritu Santo de Zuniga (41VTl1 ), located in Victoria County, Texas, was
the site of the Texas Archeological Society's 1997 summer field school. Archeological investigations were
conducted in an area (Area A) of the site believed to represent the mission Indian living quarters. Three large
excavation blocks were opened up in Area A in an attempt to find evidence indicative of mission Indian
occupation. The results of these investigations are the focus of this article.

INTRODUCTION
During the 1997 Texas Archeological Society
(TAS) field school at Mission Espiritu Santo, investigations were carried out across the site. Area
A (Figure 1), believed to be the mission Indian
habitation, was the primary focus of these investigations. Work was also completed in and around
the mission ruins (Area D) and in Area E (see
Figure 1), where excavations uncovered an intact
lime kiln. Anne Fox and Jack Eaton oversaw the
architectural investigations in Area D and a report
of their findings is available in the 1998 TAS Field
School Manual (Eaton 1998). Excavations at the
lime kiln in 1997 and 1998 were supervised by
Cecil Calhoun and Bryan Jameson. The results of
these excavations were summarized in a paper given
by Calhoun and Jameson (1998) at the 69th Annual
Meeting of the TAS in Waco, Texas.
In addition to the work conducted at 41VTl1,
T AS field school investigations were also carried
out at several sites related to 41 VTll, including
41VT121, 41VT13, and 41VT10. Limited testing
was completed at 41VT121, a sandstone quarry
located less than a mile south of the mission structures. Investigations at the site indicate that the
quarry was the primary source of stone for the
mission buildings (Jones 1998). A mission dam
and acequia, 41VT13, is located approximately

eight miles northwest of Victoria on the left bank
of Mission Creek. It is presumed that the dam and
acequia were built in conjunction with the mission
in an attempt to irrigate the mission fields (Calhoun
1966). During the 1997 TAS Field School, portions
of the dam and acequia were mapped and recorded
under the supervision of Jim Blanton. A full scale
investigation of the acequia, undertaken during the
1998 TAS Field School, consisted of the recording
and mapping of all intact portions of the acequia
(Rinker et al., this volume). Archeological and architectural investigations were also conducted at
41 VTlO, the second location of Mission Espiritu
Santo in Victoria City Park under the direction of
Kay Hindes during both the 1997 (Hindes 1997)
and 1998 TAS Field Schools (see also Hindes et
al., this volume).
A B:rief History of Mission
Espiritu Santo
The Espiritu Santo mission was first established
in 1722 at a location along Garcitas Creek near
what is now Matagorda Bay (Figure 2). The mission, founded by Franciscan missionaries sent from
Mexico, was originally established for the
Karankawa Indians. The Karankawa, however, were
antagonistic and hostile toward the Spaniards. The
reaction of the Native population, in combination

with the inhospitable climate of the coast and the
failure of crops, prompted the missionaries to relocate the mission to a site further inland (Almazan
1724). The mission was moved sometime in 1725
or 1726 to its second location at Tonkawa Bank in
today's Victoria City Park (see Figure 2). This temporary location of the mission later served as a
visita of the third location of the mission (Hindes
1995). Recent archeological and archival work by
Kay Hindes (see Hindes et al., this volume) has
firmly established this site as the second location,
or interim site, of Espfritu Santo.
The third location of the mission was founded
in 1726 along the west side of the Guadalupe River
in Mission Valley, Texas (see Figure 2). It remained
in operation here for 23 years before it was moved
a fourth and final time in 1749 to a site located on
the San Antonio River in modern-day Goliad (see
Figure 2). The removal of Espfritu Santo from Mission Valley to the San Antonio River was part of
Jose de Escand6n's colonization plan for the province of Nuevo Santander (O'Conner 1984). The
Espiritu Santo mission continued to operate until
its secularization in the 1830s.
At the third location of Espfritu Santo in Mission Valley (41VTl1 ), the Spaniards hoped to Christianize the Aranama and Tamique and convert these
Indians into loyal Spanish citizens. Little is known
about the two groups. Historical records mention
their presence at Espfritu Santo but there is a noticeable lack of information about their lifeways
and customs. Moreover, historical documents render no information about where these groups were
from. Subsequently, there is much speculation about
the origins of the Aranama and Tamique Indians.
Historical accounts cite the Aranama as the dominant group at Espfritu Santo and mention the presence of some 400 Aranama at one point during its
history on the Guadalupe River (Ramsdell 1938).
From a linguistic standpoint, the Aranama may have
some relation to Coahuilteco (Campbell 1996). We
can be fairly certain, however, that they practiced
many of the same habits and subsistence strategies
employed by other groups in the area in the Late
Prehistoric period. Like their prehistoric predecessors, the Aranama and Tamique were probably
hunter-gatherers who traveled up and down the
Guadalupe River, and perhaps across much of the
Gulf coastal plain, in search of bison and other
local animals and plants (Walter 1997). At Espfritu
Santo, cattle ranching played a major economic

99

role and the mission Indians were expected to care
for and tend the herds. Later accounts note the
mission Indians' expertise as skilled ranchers and
cowboys (Oberste 1980).
Previous Investigations
Excavations at the mission have provided an
excellent opportunity to define the components of
the mission complex and to learn more about the
lifeways of the Aranama and Tamique Indians. Archeological investigations have been primarily focused on recovering information related to the
mission Indian occupation. In the spring of 1995,
the first formal investigations at 41 VTl 1 were conducted by the Office of the State Archeologist
(OSA) at the Texas Historical Commission. The
OSA completed limited testing in and around the
mission ruins and determined that further investigations were warranted (Mercado-Allinger 1995).
More intensive testing was carried out during The
University of Texas at Austin field school in the
summer of 1995. Under the direction of Thomas R.
Hester, test excavations at the site were completed
in Areas A, B, C, and D (see Figure 1): Area A
represents a mission Indian habitation zone; Area B
includes the area to the northwest of the mission
ruins; Area C encompasses a gentle sloping terrace
to the east of the mission structures; and Area D
represents the mission structures. Testing activities
in 1995 were primarily concentrated in Areas A
and B. Excavations in Area C were restricted to one
test unit and a few shovel tests. In addition, Jack
Eaton supervised architectural testing of the mission ruins (Area D) and positively identified two
Spanish Colonial structures related to the mission
(Structures 1 and 2).
In the fall of 1995, the author, several students
from the University of Texas at Austin, and local
volunteers returned to the site to remove the remaining portions of a "bone bed" feature that was
uncovered in Area B in the summer (see also
deFrance, this volume). Construction of the landowners' home threatened the feature area, so efforts were made to completely excavate the midden.
Additionally, in 1996, members of the TAS, the
Southern Texas Archaeological Association
(STAA), and several University of Texas at Austin
students participated in a salvage operation to recover artifacts from a portion of Area B that was
also extensively bulldozed during construction.

Walter-1997 TAS Field School Excavations at Mission
The 1995 test excavations at 41 VTll indicated
a mission Indian occupation in Area A and the
possibility of finding intact midden deposits was
strongly evidenced in the results of these initial
investigations. Materials recovered in 1995 from
Area A (Table 1) include bone-tempered pottery,
European and Mexican ceramics, glass beads, lithic
scrapers, Guerrero, Cuney, Perdiz, and Darl
projectile points, bifaces, hammerstones, metal,
bone, freshwater mussel shell, marine shell, and
various pieces of worked shell and bone. The
mixture of both Spanish and Native cultural
materials found in Area A is similar to artifact
assemblages from other Indian habitation zones at
mission sites across South Texas (Hester 1989),
including Mission Rosario (Gilmore 1974; Ricklis
1998), Mission San Josey San Miguel de Aguayo
(Hard et al. 1995), Mission Espfritu Santo in Goliad
(Mounger 1959; Ricklis 1998), and Mission San
Juan Capistrano (Schuetz 1968).

1997 TAS INVESTIGATIONS

Methods
From June 14 to 21, 1997, the TAS conducted
their annual field school at the mission. Encouraged by our findings in Area A from the 1995
excavations, we decided to focus the majority of
our efforts in this part of the site. Three large excavation blocks were opened up in Area A (see Figure 1). Block A-I, the smallest unit, was a 4 x 4
meter block; A-II was a 6 x 8 meter block; and AIII was a 4 x 6 meter block. During the course of
the field school, over 200 people worked in Area
A. A total of 59 m2 was opened and over 16 m3 of
dirt were excavated.
A Total Datum Station was used to establish
the grid for each excavation block. In addition,
actual elevations were established and used during
the excavations. For the purposes of this article,

however, the elevations have been converted to cm
below the ground surface (cm bs). The blocks were
divided up into 2 x 2 meter squares made up of four
1 x 1 meter units. Levels were removed in 5 cm
increments with the exception of the first levels.
Beginning levels were excavated in 10 cm segments in order to remove the overburden. All of the
excavated dirt was water-screened through 118-inch
wire mesh. An eight liter flotation sample was taken
from the southwest unit of each 2 x 2 meter square
for every level excavated.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
Excavations in Area A were geared towards
answering specific questions about both the mission Indian activities and the layout of the habitation area. Through a study of the distribution and

patterning of artifacts, the purpose or purposes of
Area A are examined. First, the findings from each
block are summarized and then the implications of
these results are discussed. The results described
here are not intended to be conclusive. Rather, they
represent a preliminary assessment of Area A based
on the patterning of cultural materials and basic
artifact categories.

BLOCK A-I
A total of 61 levels or 3.8 m3 of dirt was removed from Block A-I. The deepest units were
excavated to ca. 45 cm bs. A variety of cultural
materials were recovered from Block A-I, including bone-tempered aboriginal pottery, Spanish Colonial ceramics, mussel shell, lithic debitage, metal,
glass, and bone (Table 2). No features, however,

Comparatively, Block A-I produced the least
amount of faunal materials of the 1997 block
excavations. Of the faunal remains recovered
from Block A-I, over 90 percent were removed
from 0-25 cm bs. This figure is skewed slightly
by the fact that, on average, only five levels, or
25-30 cm of matrix, were excavated from the
units in Block A-I. Faunal counts decrease as the
depths of units increase. Again, this may also be
the result of fewer units being excavated below
30 cm. The faunal remains recovered from Block
A-I are summarized in Table 3. Almost half (45
percent) of the bone found in Block A-I was identified as either bovid (cow/bison) or cow-sized
mammal (McClure 1999). The remaining faunal

Lithic debitage was the most abundant lithic
artifact type found in all three blocks. Block A-I
yielded more debitage than both blocks A-II and AIII. Debitage counts are high between 0-35 cm bs,
with a slight decrease from 20-25 cm bs. The number of flakes decrease more significantly from 3545 cm bs, correlating with a decrease in the number
of units that reached these levels. Only two 1 x 1
meter units were excavated to levels 6 and 7. Despite the low number of units that reached levels 6
and 7, debitage counts remained relatively high in
the deposits.
Only 19 lithic tools are represented from Block
A-I. They include three hammerstones, one
Guerrero point (Figure 3a), the proximal end of a

Native Pottery
The Native pottery found in
Area A and across the site, by and
large, refers to the bone-tempered
ware that dominates the collection
(Figure 4). Bone-tempered pottery,
which is similar to Leon Plain
ware (Hester 1989), outnumbers
Spanish Colonial wares (non-Native) 50:1 in Area A. Block A-I
produced the least amount of bonetempered sherds in Area A. Of the
1009 sherds collected, approximately 80 percent were recovered
from the upper 25 cm of the block.
The remaining sherds were found
in levels 4-6 (25-40 cm bs).

straight to contracted stem dart point, four unifaces,
two bifaces, and four edge-modified flakes. In
addition, five cores were also recovered. Lithic
artifacts were only found between 0-35 cm bs;
however as previously mentioned, both levels 6
and 7 (30-40 cm bs) are under-represented in this
sample. Table 4 provides vertical locations for
the tools and lithic artifacts found in Block A-I.

Non-Native Ceramics
Twenty-three pieces of Spanish Colonial ware
are represented in the Block A-I collection. Twentyone of the 23 specimens were found between 0-25
cm bs. Level 4 (20-25 cm bs) had two sherds and
no non-Native ceramics were recovered from 3045 cm bs. Nine varieties of ceramics were identified

from this block (Lakeman 1998). Four of these
varieties either pre-date or are contemporaneous
with the mission occupation of 41VTl1. These
include Puebla Blue on White majolica (Figure 5ab ), Puebla Polychrome (Figure 5c), olive jar (Figure
6a), and Galera ware (Figure 6b). Two of the
varieties, 1830s whiteware and Puebla Blue on
White II, post-date the occupation of the mission.

105

Aranama Polychrome (Figure 7a) may or may not
post-date the mission occupation at the site. Deagan
(1987) places the production of Aranama Polychrome from 1750-1800. Similarly, Goggin (1968)
also dates its span from the middle of the 18th
century onward. Dates for two of the types present,
an unidentified lead-glazed ware and undecorated
majolica, are unknown.
Puebla Blue on White majolica sherds were the
most common non-Native ceramic found in Block
A-I (n=8), followed by Aranama Polychrome (n=2)
and unidentified Mexican lead-glazed ware (n=2).
The remaining ceramic types are represented by
one sherd each. The vertical proveniences of these
non-Native sherds are listed in Table 5.

. Molluscan Remains
A total of 124 freshwater mussel (Unionidae)
shells and fragments was counted from Block A-I.
This represents both whole and fragmented shells,
not a minimum number of individuals. Block A-I
also produced the least amount of shell from the
three blocks.
Over half of the Block A-I mussel shell came
from 0-20 cm bs, although levels 4-6 (20-35 cm bs)
also produced shell. Two shell beads were collected from level 2 (10-15 cm bs). The larger of the
two shell beads (Figure 8a) is barrel-shaped, while
the smaller bead (Figure 8b) is more donut-shaped.
Level 4 (20-25 cm bs) also contained worked shell:
a small, donut-shaped shell bead (Figure 8c) and a
portion of a rectangular mussel shell pendant with
two drilled holes near its edge (Figure 8d). No shell

Glass

Figure 8. Shell Artifacts: a-c, shell beads; d-e, shell
pendants.

Twenty-eight sherds of glass were collected
from Block A-I. All but one glass sherd was found
between 0-10 cm bs. These are all clear, thin (less
than 1 mm thick) glass pieces that appear to be
from the same vessel or object. One piece of opaque,
brown/black glass (5 mm thick) was found in level
3 (15-20 cm bs).

BLOCK A-II
was recovered below 35-40 cm bs. In addition,
no marine shell has, thus far, been identified from
the block.

Block A-II was the largest excavation block
opened up in Area A. A total of 7.9 m 3 of dirt
was removed from 28 m 2 â¢ The block was
excavated to a maximum depth of 50 cm bs.
Block A-II yielded much of the same mission

Metal
Fourteen metal fragments and objects were
found in Block A-I. Eleven were recovered between 0-10 cm bs, including a child's ring (Figure
9a) with a blue inset glass stone. The ring was
probably given to a mission Indian child by a
missionary. One metal fragment was collected
from 10-15 cm bs and two others were retrieved
from 20 cm bs. The vast majority of the metal
found, with the exception of the ring, are unidentifiable fragments.

Indian materials as Block A-I, but in greater
quantities (Table 6). Furthermore, Block A-II also
contained two features.

Bone
Block A-II produced the largest quantity of
bone. Bovid bone, including long bone fragments,
adult and sub-adult teeth, and near-complete mandibles, constituted 71 percent (n=715) of the identified fauna. Cow/bison bone was found in abundance
from 0-30 cm bs, but in lesser amounts between 3540 cm bs (Table 7). Domesticated taxa from Block
A-II include sheep/goat, pig, and horse. Notably,

all of the domesticated animal remains, with the
exception of undistinguished cow/bison bone, were
found in the upper 4 levels (0-25 cm bs) of the
block. In addition, two dense concentrations of bone
were uncovered in levels 3 (15-20 cm bs) and designated features.

Feature A-H-1
Feature A-II-1 (Figure 10) covered almost l m2
and was encountered at the bottom of level 2 (1015 cm bs). In addition to the clustering of bone,
Feature A-II-1 also contained lithic debitage, bonetempered pottery, a Spanish Colonial ceramic sherd,

encountered in level 2. The feature extends into
the east wall of the unit and probably extends
into the unexcavated mid-section of Block A-II.
This feature also appears to be the remains of a
small trash midden that is directly associated
with, if not part of, Feature A-II-1. The association of Feature A-II-2 with Feature A-II-1 indicates that they are contemporaneous. Both
features appear to have accumulated during the
mission Indian occupation.
The majority of bone recovered from Feature
A-II-2 is cow/bison. Gar fish, unidentified large
mammal, and several bone-tempered sherds were
also present in the feature, along with mussel shell,
a burned rock, and unidentified fauna! materials.

mussel shell, one uniface, and one Guerrero point
(see Figure 3b). Both domestic and wild taxa were
recovered, including catfish, unidentified fish, pit
viper snake, turtle, softshell turtle, turkey, deer,
cow/bison, large mammal, and sheep or goat. Although not designated as part of the feature during
the excavations, it appears that much of the faunal
and Ethic debris in the units directly south of Feature A-II-1 are part of the feature. The accumulation of materials in these units appears to extend
outside the excavation block. Feature A-II-1 is
probably the remains of a small trash heap where
food remains were discarded after being processed
and consumed. The presence of the Guerrero point,
the Spanish Colonial ceramic sherd, and domestic
fauna! materials suggests that the small midden is
contemporaneous with the mission period occupation.

flakes were also found in the deeper levels. An
average of 4.6 levels per unit was excavated in
Block A-II. This may account for the decrease in
flakes below levels 4 (20-25 cm bs); however, 46
percent of the 28 units opened were excavated below level 4.
Twenty-seven stone tools are identified from
Block A-II: eight unifaces; four hammerstones; four
cores; two possible gunflints; one biface; one edgemodified flake; one metate fragment; one mano
fragment; one Guerrero point (see Figure 3b); a
Guerrero preform (see Figure 3c), a proximal fragment of a side-notched dart point (Figure 12b); the
proximal end of a Marcos point (Figure 12c); and
the proximal end of a Perdiz point (Figure 12d).
Twenty-six of these lithic artifacts were recovered
from the first four levels (Table 8). Interestingly,
the older dart point and Marcos point were found in
levels above the Perdiz and Guerrero points. The
stratigraphic reversal of these points is probably the
result of either natural or cultural disturbances.

Native Pottery
Bone-tempered pottery was found in all levels
of Block A-II except level 9 (45-50 cm bs). Ninetyfive percent of the sherds were recovered from 025 cm bs, but below 20-25 cm bs, sherd counts of
bone-tempered ware dropped significantly. However, more than half of the units opened ended at
levels 4. Block A-II yielded more bone-tempered
pottery than either blocks A-I or A-III.

Non-Native Ceramics
Thirty non-Native sherds were collected from
Block A-II. All 30 sherds were found from 0-25
cm bs, but 4 7 percent came from 0-10 cm bs
(Table 9). These sherds include nine identifiable
and three unidentified types (Lakeman 1998), including undecorated majolicas, olive jar sherds
(n=5), whiteware (n=3), two pieces each of leadglazed ware, Puebla polychrome, Aranama polychrome, Puebla blue on white, and Guadalajara
polychrome pottery (see Figure 6c). In addition,
one piece of Chinese porcelain (see Figure 7b), a
Mexican lead-glazed rim sherd (see Figure 7c),
and one unidentified sherd were also collected
from Block A-II.

Molluscan Remains
Freshwater mussel shell (Unionidae) was
present in levels 1 through 9 (0-50 cm bs). Over 60
percent of the shell was found between 0-15 cm bs.
The shell counts decrease rapidly in the lower levels of the block. In addition to freshwater shell, a
marine shell (Olividae) fragment was also found in
level 1 (0-10 cm bs).
Metal
Metal was found in the most abundance in
Block A-II, with more than 50 pieces of metal
collected from the excavations. The majority
are non-diagnostic fragments, found from 0-10
cm bs. Several of these metal objects included
modern nails and fragments of barbed wire fencing that post-date the occupation of the mission.
The remaining metal artifacts were found between 10-25 cm bs.

Glass

Figure 12. Projectile Points: a, unidentified dart point
base; b, side-notched dart point base; c, Marcos point
base; d, Perdiz arrowpoint.

Block A-II contained more glass (n=26) than
either blocks A-I or A-III. Among the block's glass
artifacts was one glass trade bead. Most of the glass
items are broken pieces of glass from unidentified
objects or vessels. Although glass was found between 0-25 cm bs, level 1 (0-10 cm bs) had 73
percent of the glass artifacts from the block.
Sixteen of the glass fragments are very thin
(less than 1 mm thick) clear glass sherds that
appear to be from the same object. Two of the

glass artifacts from level 1 are refits that most
likely post-date the occupation of the mission.
Both of these clear glass pieces have bubbleshaped decorative rims and may have formed
part of a bowl or cup. One additional glass fragment found in level 1 also appears to post-date
the mission occupation. It is a clear piece of
broken glass (2.5 mm thick) with the letters "r's"
raised on its surface. The fragment likely came
from a bottle or mason jar.
There were four glass artifacts, including a gla~s
bead, from 10-15 cm bs. The remaining glass
artifacts include three small pieces of clear, thin
glass with a thickness of 1-2 mm. The glass trade
bead (see Figure 9c) is a large necklace bead
(Harris type no. 42) or "mulberry" bead. It is
barrel-shaped and of mandrel-wound, pressed

facet, simple construction. Its surface resembles
that of hobnail glass and it dates from 1700-1740
(Harris and Harris 1967).
Three pieces of glass were recovered from
level 3 (15-20 cm bs), including one small,
heavily patinated sherd of clear glass (3 mm
thick), a piece of brown patinated glass 2.5 mm
in thickness, and one small sherd of clear glass 2
mm in thickness. No glass was found between
25-50 cm bs.

An area of 16 m2 was opened and 4.45 m3 of
dirt were removed from Block A-III during the

a westward facing slope in Area A (see Figure 1).
Test excavations in 1995 suggested the possibility
of a dense bone midden in this part of Area A. In
addition, a cattle trail and small east-west drainage
that runs across the area revealed bone, sherds, and
lithics. Block A-III was opened up in order to investigate these findings. An average of 4.5 levels
was excavated per unit in the block, :.md approximately 50 percent of the excavation block was excavated below level 4. The block was excavated to
a maximum depth of 40 cm bs.
Block A-III excavations yielded similar artifact
assemblages to those found in blocks A-I and A-II.
However, the quantity of certain cultural materials
(Table 10) from Block A-III varied greatly from
the other two blocks.

mestic pig (both categories comprise less than 1
percent of the identified faunal remains), found in
the upper 20 cm of the block (Table 11). A tubular
bone bead (Figure 13) similar to the bone beads
found at the site in 1995 and 1996 (Hester et al.
1996; Walter 1997) was collected from level 2 (1015 cm bs).

Lithics
Lithic debitage in Block A-III, although found
in all levels, was concentrated between 10-20 cm
bs. The flake counts decrease below 20-25 cm bs,
which corresponds with a decline in the number of
units that were taken below this depth.

Bone
Bone was found from 0-40 cm bs. Ninety-four
percent of the faunal materials recovered from Block
A-III were found between 0-25 cm bs, and counts
dropped significantly from 20-25 cm bs. The frequency of bone also declined from 25-40 cm bs,
coinciding with a decrease in the number of units
that were excavated below 20-25 cm bs.
Forty-eight percent (n=l37) of the identified
faunal materials are either bovid or cow-sized mammals. Domestic taxa include sheep/goat and do-

More lithic tools and artifacts were found in
Block A-III than either of the other two blocks
combined. Fifty-four stone tools were recovered
between 0-35 cm bs in the block. The collection is
comprised of 13 hammerstones, 12 edge-modified
flakes, five cores, five unifaces, four choppers, three
bifaces, two perforators (Figure 14a-b), a medial
fragment of a dart point, an arrow point preform,
three mano fragments, one Guerrero point (see
Figure 3d), and one gunflint (Figure 14c). The
largest concentration (68 percent) of lithic tools
was recovered between 15-30 cm bs (Table 12).

Native Pottery
Native bone-tempered pottery was present in
all levels of Block A-III. Eighty-seven percent of

the aboriginal pottery, however, was found from
0-20 cm bs. The quantity of bone-tempered pottery decreases substantially from 20-25 cm bs to
Â·40 cm bs.

Walter-1997 TAS Field School Excavations at Mission Espiritu Santo de Zuniga
Non-Native Ceramics
Non-Native ceramic counts are low in Block
A-III, with 21 sherds found in five of the seven
levels excavated in the block. The majority came
from 0-15 cm bs. Two other sherds were found
between 15-20 cm bs, another from 25-30 cm bs,
and one sherd from 35-40 cm bs. Eight types of
ceramics are present, including lead-glazed wares
(n=6), plain majolica (n=5), Puebla Blue on White
majolica (n=l), Puebla Polychrome (n=l), olive jar
(n=4 ), Aranama Polychrome (n= 1), 1830s
whiteware (n=2), and Chinese porcelain (n= 1)
(Table 13).

Molluscan Remains
Block A-III contained more freshwater mussel
shell (Unionidae) than the other two blocks. Greater
than 50 percent of the mussel shell sample was
found between 0-20 cm bs.
A rectangular mussel shell pendant with two
drilled holes near the top of an elongated edge (see

115

Figure 8e) was recovered between 10-15 cm bs. The
pendant is similar to the shell ornament found in
Block A-I, and to shell pendants recovered from the
1995 excavations (Walter 1997). One marine shell
or scallop (Pectinidae) was found in level 5 (2530 cm bs). In addition, three shell features, including a feature that was identified during the 1995
excavations, were encountered in Block A-III.
Features
Feature 95-2 was described by Walter (1997)
as a dense concentration of freshwater mussel shell
that appeared to be the result of shell processing
and subsistence activities. The remaining portion
of Feature 95-2 (Figure 15), exposed at 15-20 cm
bs, extends approximately 20-35 cm to the north of
the previously excavated northern edge of the
feature and measures approximately 10 cm in
thickness. In addition to shell, the feature also
contained snail shells, chert flakes, and a few bone
fragments, along with a broken biface and bonetempered pottery.

Both Features A-III-I and A-III-2 are contemporaneous refuse heaps (Figure 16) that were
found in the same lxl meter unit and encountered
at the same depth (25-30 cm bs). Feature A-III-I
is a small, dense concentration of freshwater mussel shell. Feature A-III-2 is located just northwest
of Feature A-III- I. This feature is also a dense
concentration of mussel shell intermixed with
flakes, a broken hammerstone, and one edge-modified flake.
An additional clustering of shell (Figure 17),
although not designated a feature, was also noted
in another unit at the same depth (25-30 cm bs)
as Features A-III-1 and A-III-2. This discrete
concentration of shells was associated with several flakes and a few, scattered burned rocks.
The feature most likely represents another small
trash heap that amassed during and after subsistence activities.

Four glass items were found in Block A-III:
one glass trade bead and several miscellaneous and
undated glass fragments. Level 1 (0-10 cm bs) contained one small sherd of beige-colored, frosted
glass ( 1.5 mm thick) and a glass trade bead. The
glass bead (see Figure 9b) is a donut-shaped, translucent blue seed bead (Harris type No. 48) that
dates from 1700-1836 (Harris and Harris 1967).
Level 3 (15-20 cm bs) had one bottle neck fragment of amber-colored glass. The glass fragment
measures 1 mm in thickness at the body and 4 mm
at the neck. A small piece of light green glass was
found from 20-25 cm bs.

Metal
Metal was found only in the first three levels of
Block A-III, with more than 50 percent of the 24
metal fragments found in the first levels. Although
no formal analysis has been completed, initial examination of the metal indicate a large number of

All three of the excavation blocks from Area A
produced similar concentrations of cultural materials. Although only five features were uncovered,
evidence of mission Indian occupation is manifested
in the assemblage and patterning of artifacts
throughout Area A.
Block A-I
When examining the horizontal provenience of
cultural materials from Block A-I, there appear to
be no discrete concentrations of artifacts or faunal
materials, but rather a light scattering of mission
Indian materials. Of all three excavation blocks
opened up in Area A, Block A-I was the smallest
excavation area. Not surprisingly, this block also
had the least amount of cultural materials. The
lithic debitage count in Block A-I, however, is
high relative to its size and the density of artifacts
recovered from the other two blocks. High flake
counts are noted in the lower as well as the upper
levels of the deposits, and this may reflect the
discard of materials from lithic reduction or tool
manufacturing activities.
The lithic materials encountered in levels 5-7
(below 30 cm bs) of Block A-I probably pre-date

118

the mission period and are indicative of a Late
Prehistoric occupation of the site. Judging from the
vertical and horizontal locations of artifacts, the
mission Indian deposits are encompassed in the
first four levels (0-30 cm bs) of the block. The
mission deposits are characterized by domestic fauna! materials, Spanish Colonial ceramics, and glass
and metal artifacts that are probably related to the
Spanish occupation of the site.

the occasional mission period artifact found in the
lower levels of the block (Shoberg 1998).
Unquestionably, there were mission deposits present
in Block A-III; however, the bulk of the materials
appear to be related to a Late Prehistoric occupation.
Freshwater mussel shell, bone-tempered pottery, and lithic debitage and tools were found in
abundance in Block A-III, along with three shell
features, including part of a feature that was uncovered in 1995. Most likely, these features resulted
from the processing and consumption of mussels.

Block A-II
Block A-II is the largest block in Area A, and it
yielded the largest sample of cultural materials.
Like Block A-I, the mission deposits here appear to
be confined to the upper 25 cm, although some
stratigraphic mixing of mission and pre-mission deposits may have occurred, based on the provenience
of dart points and arrow points.
Most of the midden deposit encountered in
Block A-II consist of bone. In addition, the two
Spanish Colonial age features identified are comprised of discrete bone clusters with domestic and
wild taxa. The dense concentrations of bone are
probably indicative of animal processing and/or
food consumption. The occurrence of several lithic
unifaces or scrapers in association with the faunal
materials suggests that food preparation activities
were being performed here. Although no complete
metal tools were found, the relative abundance of
metal fragments from the block suggests the importance of metal tools in combination with lithic scrapers in butchering and processing both indigenous
and Spanish-introduced animals. This was also evidenced in the faunal materials collected from Area
B during the 1995 excavations (Walter 1997).

Block A-HI
Block A-III produced the densest concentration
of materials. Unlike blocks A-I and A-II, however,
the mission deposits in Block A-III are not as dense,
but are concentrated between 0-15 cm bs. Also, the
bulk of Late Prehistoric cultural materials are found
below the mission deposits (15-25 cm bs). The
placement of the block along a slope suggests that
erosion may have removed much of the upper portion
of the mission deposits, leaving only a thin layer of
mission-related materials. The erosion and
disturbance of the soil deposits may also account for

IMPLICATIONS
The patterning of artifacts from Area A indicate that mission Indian habitation deposits are
present in this part of the site, although there was
little evidence obtained regarding specific activities (i.e., very few discrete features were found).
Furthermore, a Late Prehistoric occupation of the
site was identified below the mission Indian archeological deposits. A preliminary comparison of
these two separate occupations suggests that certain Late Prehistoric technologies and lifeways continued into the mission period.
The Toyah horizon represents the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 1300-1600) in southern Texas
(Black 1986, 1989). This period is characterized by
Perdiz projectile points, end scrapers, gravers, perforators, knives, bone tools, bison faunal remains,
and bone-tempered pottery (Leon Plain) (Black
1989; Hester 1989). Interestingly, Area A yielded a
collection of artifacts and faunal remains from both
the upper and lower levels of the excavation blocks
that resemble Toyah horizon assemblages. Lithic
debitage, Perdiz projectile points, scrapers, unifaces,
perforators, mussel shell, shell and bone ornaments,
and bone-tempered pottery comprised much of the
collection from the Area A excavations of 1995
and 1997. The presence of these artifacts in both
the pre-mission and mission deposits suggests a
persistence of Late Prehistoric traditions and technologies into the protohistoric and historic eras.
The appearance of Spanish-introduced cultural
materials and their association with Native cultural
remains marks the mission occupation period at the
site. More specifically, this collection of cultural
materials indicates a mission Indian occupation in
Area A. What separates the mission deposits from
the prehistoric occupation of the site is the presence

Walter - 1997 TAS Field School Excavations at Mission Espiritu Santo de Zuiiiga

of Spanish-introduced artifacts such as metal, glass,
European and Mexican ceramics, and Spanish-introduced livestock. In addition, the appearance of
Guerrero projectile points and Native-made
gunflints is also indicative of the mission era (Hester
1989). Undoubtedly, the lithic artifacts, worked shell
and bone, and bone-tempered pottery are aboriginal in origin and the Spanish-introduced artifacts
were incorporated, to some degree, into the lifeways
of the Native inhabitants.
Although no direct evidence of living structures was found, the cultural materials recovered
indicate a strong mission Indian presence in Area
A. Area A consists, primarily, of scattered intact
midden deposits suggestive of Native residence. At
present, relating Area A to the rest of the site is
difficult. Unfortunately, the entire layout of the mission complex is not presently known. However, the
1995, 1997, and 1998 investigations in the architectural ruins, Area D, do provide some interesting
clues to the mission's organization.
Five structures have currently been identified
at 41VTl1. The mission structures were constructed
of sandstone cut from the quarry. Mortar for building was most likely produced in lime kilns, such as
the kiln discovered in Area E (Figure 18). The
structures form an L-shaped pattern (see Figure 1)
that appears to be the west and north edges of a
plaza or compound. The outer western walls of the
structures are presumed to have formed part of a
protective wall for that portion of the complex. Although no direct evidence of a wall or enclosure was
found, it is assumed that a protective wall or palisade
extended eastward from the mission structures to
form the compound (Walter and Hester 1998).
During the 1995 University of Texas Field
School, Jack Eaton identified two mission structures (Structures lA and 2). The partially standing
ruins represent Structure IA (Figure 19). The sturdy
construction and thick walls of Structure lA indicate that it may have served as the granary or part
of the mission church. Structure 2, a detached building directly south of Structure lA, was completely
uncovered in 1997 during the TAS Field School
and is identified as the friar's living quarters (Eaton
1998). The structure has red painted plaster on its
interior walls and a base of an altar or shrine that
was probably used to hold a religious statue or
cross (Eaton 1998).
Three additional structures were uncovered
during the 1997 and 1998 TAS Field Schools.

119

Structures lB and 3 extend north from Structure
lA and may form part of the church. The north wall
of Structure 3 forms a semi-circular pattern or apselike feature. The poor construction of Structure 3
and the lack of symmetry suggests that the structure
may have been added later (Walter and Hester
1998). Structures 4 and 5, oriented east-west,
presumably form part of the northern wall of the

Figure 18. Lime Kiln.

m1ss10n complex. The two structures share a
common wall; however, it does not appear that they
were built at the same time. Structure 5, for example,
shares construction details with Structure 3,
indicating that both structures may have been built
haphazardly. The base of a buttress was found along
the northeast comer of Structure 4 and a similar
feature was located outside of Structure lB. In
addition, two layers of cobble floors were also
uncovered during the 1998 investigations just
outside a splayed doorway of structure 5. In direct
association with the cobble floors was a midden
containing mission Indian bone-tempered pottery,
majolicas and other Spanish Colonial ceramics,
some Caddo Indian pottery, various metal objects,
glass beads, and large amounts of processed animal
bone (Walter and Hester 1998).
As stated above, it is probable that structures 1
through 5 helped to form the western and northern
boundaries of the enclosed mission complex. It appears that all of these structures opened up into a
central plaza area just east of Structures l, 2, and 3.
Seemingly all of this area would have been surrounded by a protective stone wall or, more likely,
a wooden palisade; the size of the compound remains unknown. Despite the lack of evidence for a
compound wall, archeological reports and historical accounts note their presence at several of the
missions in Texas (Hard et al. 1995; Mounger 1959;
Oberste 1980; Ricklis 1998). The Native inhabitants at Espiritu Santo probably lived outside the
compound walls, at least during the initial years of
a mission's existence when more permanent residences inside the complex were not yet constructed
(Anne Fox, 1998 personal communication).
Despite the paucity of information on the size
and dimensions of the mission complex, the layout
of the existing structures suggest that Area A was
outside the mission compound. The mission Indians were known to have left the mission at different
times throughout the year to return to traditional
territories and lifeways (Castaneda 1936-1939). The
mission was at a disadvantage because of its isolated location along the northern frontier of New
Spain, making it difficult to acquire necessary supplies to support themselves and the Native population. Because the Aranama and Tamique were not
permanent residents of the mission- and due to
the brief amount of time the mission was occupied-it is plausible that a large portion of the Indian habitation areas were outside the mission walls

where temporary shelters may have been constructed. Area A probably comprises the largest
Native residence area at the site.

CONCLUSIONS
Over the course of three years, investigations
at Espfritu Santo (41VT11) in Mission Valley,
Texas, have largely focused on the mission Indian
habitation areas of the site (Area A). Initial testing
at the site in 1995 revealed a significant mission
Indian occupation in Area A, and subsequent excavations in 1997 verified this area as a Native habitation zone. The 1997 T AS field school excavations
constituted the largest investigation of Area A and
the entire mission to date.
Three large excavation blocks were opened in
Area A. The goal of our investigations there was to
expand the 1995 excavations. The cultural materials recovered in the block excavations indicated
that both Late Prehistoric and mission period occupations are present in Area A. The mission period
deposits were marked by the presence of both Spanish and Native cultural remains. The mission deposits are concentrated in the upper 30 cm of Area
A and a Late Prehistoric occupation is present beneath these deposits. No direct evidence of living
structures (e.g., post holes or daub) was found;
however, the combination of the artifact assemblage and the layout of the mission structures distinguishes Area A as a mission Indian living area.
This article represents a preliminary study of
the 1997 TAS excavations. Certainly future analyses will expand our knowledge of the Native habitation zones. Additional materials from both the
1997 and 1998 T AS Field Schools have yet to be
analyzed and more extensive archival research is
currently underway. Our initial findings, however,
provide a general understanding of the functions
of Area A and future work is not likely to contradict our initial conclusions. Ideally, more intensive investigations of Area A will contribute to a
better understanding of the everyday lives of the
mission Indians.

Jennifer Rinker, I. Waynne Cox, and C. Britt Bousman

INTRODUCTION
Investigations at the Texas Archeological Society field school at Mission Espiritu Santo de
Zuniga in the summers of 1997 and 1998, under the
direction of Dr. Thomas R. Hester, included the
relocation and documentation of the acequia (irrigation) system. Over the period of occupation at
the mission, two acequia systems were built and
abandoned. Physical, historical, and paleoclimatic
analyses indicate that the acequia system was established during a drought and abandoned during a
wet period when the mission inhabitants shifted to
dry land farming.

HISTORICAL RECORDS ANALYSIS
AND INTERPRETATION
On April 10, 1722, the Marquis de Aguayo
authorized Father Patron to establish a mission near
the new presidio on the banks of Garcitas Creek.
The murder of Captain Domingo Ramon in 1723,
followed by the inept leadership of his son, Diego,
and the continuing hostility of the Karankawa,
doomed the first attempt to settle the area at Espiritu
Santo Bay (O'Connor 1966:10-13). An inspection
of the inhospitable environment and inaccessible
region by Governor Perez de Almazan, in April
1726, caused him to order its relocation to the
Guadalupe River valley. The mission Nuestra
Senora del Espfritu Santo de Zuniga and the presidio
La Bahia (Nuestra Senora de Loreto) were in their
new location (now 41VT11) when Pedro de Rivera
y Villalon arrived, on November 27, 1727, to
include them as a part of his four year inspection of
the frontier defenses of New Spain (Jackson and
Foster 1995:40). It has been reported that during

his short visit Rivera recommended that "the
soldiers and mission Indians should construct a dam
in order to irrigate the lands" (Castaneda 1938:85).
This recommendation is not unexpected considering the mind set of the Spanish. The high, arid
land of central Spain required the utmost care and
management of the limited water sources to support its population. The Moors had elevated that
requirement to a refined science. That is not to say
that the irrigation skills of Spain were solely a gift
of the Islamic occupation; the Roman innovations
in classical Europe are still dramatically evident in
the remains of the first century A.D. stone aqueducts near Segovia (Glick 1970: 188). The Moors
brought with them, through their Middle Eastern
heritage, techniques that had made the deserts of
North Africa lush and productive, and applied them
to their new land across the Mediterranean. Upon
their conquest of Mexico, the Spanish found an
abundance of canal irrigation in use in the New
World (Doolittle 1990:6). It was only natural for
them to make this their first consideration in the
selection of a site for a new settlement.
Although it is not known exactly when the
recommendation from Rivera was taken and the
construction of an acequia system initiated, all early
reports of the mission are consistent in the results
of the venture. Herbert Eugene Bolton (1915:1920) reported:
... several years had been spent, after the
transfer to the Guadalupe River, in an
attempt to build a dam across that stream
as a preliminary to irrigation. Meanwhile the missionary had supported his
charges on provisions purchased with
his annual stipend. But this did not suffice, and during the greater part of the

year the Indians sought their own food
on the prairies and the forest. In 1736,
however, the attempt to build the dam
was abandoned, and agriculture without
irrigation was at once successfully established. Thereafter the Indians raised, by
their own labor, plentiful maize and vegetables, and cared for large herds of stock.

Over two decades later, Carlos Castaneda
(1938:85) repeated essentially the same story, noting that "for ten years they all tried in vain to
carry out this impossible project." The consistency
of the reports is not remarkable since there is virtually only one account of this venture that has
been located to date, the report of Father Ignacio
Antonio Ciprian to the Commissary General of
October 27, 1749:
The two tribes of the Tamiquez and the
Xaranamas Indians joined the mission
and for ten continuous years the poor
missionary supported the Indians at a
great financial strain, paying the expenses
with the allowance His Majesty gave him
for his maintenance. The provisions were
transported 110 leagues from the Rio
Grande missions or 60 leagues from the
missions of San Antonio. This supply
was not sufficient to maintain the Indians, who for a good part of the year
supported themselves by hunting and by
gathering what they found in the fields.
Beset with all these problems, the mission now pressed for ways of drawing
water from the river to irrigate the fields.
A great amount of money and time were
spent in carrying out this plan, which
was given up in 1736, when planting was
done during the rainy season of the year.
The Indians now had sufficient food, and
the superfluous corn of the preceding year
is given to the Captain of the presidio
and in lean years he pays for it
(Leutenneger 1979:22-23).
Father Ciprian arrived in Texas before 1731
and administered the first baptism at the newly
established Villa de San Fernando, later to become
the city of San Antonio. In 1738, he was chosen
vicar and secretary of the College of Zacatecas, and
in 1741 he was elected as consultor. He apparently
replaced the missionary at Nuestra Senora del

Espfritu Santo in August 1747. Although it is
unfortunate that the only accounts of the period of
irrigation were written by the missionary who was
not present during that time, the late arrival of Father
Ciprian does not greatly weaken the reliability of
his account; the truth is, his is the only one available.
Father Mariano de Anda y Altamirano had served
as the missionary at the mission from 1727 until he
was replaced to travel to Mexico City to present a
memorial on behalf of the San Xavier missions.
Due to the relocation of these missions to the San
Antonio River, he probably did not return to that
post (Habig 1973:110, 115).

TECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
There are, in fact, not one but two separate
structures in association with the irrigation system, both apparently constructed during the colonial period while the mission was occupied. The
one referred to by Father Ciprian is located on the
west bank of the Guadalupe River approximately
300 m south of the De Witt County line, and has
been recorded as 41VT135. The other structure,
41VTl3, is located on the left bank of Mission
Creek approximately 13 km northwest of Victoria
(Calhoun 1966). Both are diversion darns, or weirs,
meaning that their purpose is to redirect the flow
of water into the acequia, and not to serve as
impoundment structures.
The structures are constructed of hewn limestone block quarried at their respective locations,
and they appear to have been fully completed at the
time of their abandonment. Although the report
states that the period of hardship lasted a full decade, it does not state that the effort to construct the
Guadalupe darn was undertaken for that length of
time. In fact, it appears to indicate that after enduring food supply shortages for some period of time,
the dam and acequia construction was undertaken
as a means to alleviate the situation. It is clear that
the attempt was abandoned in 1736 when dry land
agriculture was attempted and found to be the solution. There is no mention of the second system
established on Mission Creek, although the acequia
was apparently completed, but of limited success.
The primary limitation to the second system is that
Mission Creek, at present, is an intermittent stream
and contains water only during rainy periods, and
would have had very limited use during periods of

the water to the fields under cultivation.
The channel of the Guadalupe River is extremely wide at this location, and the bedrock is
exposed both on the bank and into the riverbed.

footing to support such a substantial structure. In addition, the banks, at least presently, are relatively downcut and would
not provide the necessary grade to allow
water to flow into an acequia; in other
words, water would either have to flow
uphill or such an enormous structure would
have to be created to achieve the water
level necessary to flow at that elevation.

Even though the area at the dam is
relatively flat compared to the rest of the
river, the topography is still significantly
steep between the river and the probable
irrigation lands that the acequia would have
to have paralleled the river for quite a distance before the path could have been taken
away from the river. We found no evidence
of the acequia in our brief reconnaissance,
but the topography dictates that, unless they
had devised some way to make water go
uphill, this is the only possibility. In addition, we feel that, due to the extension of
the dam well into the present bed of the
river, the dam was constructed during a dry
year. Therefore, because the location of the
dam necessitated that the acequia very
closely parallel the river for quite a distance, one slightly heavy rain would cause
the river to rise significantly and potentially destroy a large portion of the acequia.
When the acequias are earthen with no
berm reinforcements or channel protection,
as these appear to have been, the system
could have been destroyed beyond repair
with one minor flood. However, because
accessibility to private lands prevented any
further investigations of the acequia, what
we propose here is only the most probable
explanation with the present data.

41VT13, THE MISSION CREEK
DAM AND ACEQUIA
The better-known dam structure associated
with the mission occupation is located on Mission
Creek approximately 13 km northwest of Victoria,
just off Lower Mission Valley Road. The dam is
14 m long (Figure 2) and does not extend more than
5 m into the present creek. Although the highest
point of the structure is only ca. 1.25 m above the
present ground surface (bs), testing during the 1997
Texas Archeological Society field school indicated
that the coursing continued 1.50 m bs to the base
of the dam on a bedrock foundation. This indicates
that although some of the upper courses of the dam
are certainly missing now, the dam stood at least
2.75 min height from its bedrock footing. The dam
is located at a slight bend in the creek that would
have facilitated the flow of the water toward the

west bank where the dam is located. The offtake to
the acequia is well-defined as an intentional opening in the approximate center point of the dam.
There is also evidence of a set of slots cut into the
dam for a sluice gate to control the flow of water
into the canal.
One hand-dug trench across the acequia (Figure 3), located 190 m from the dam, indicated that
the acequia itself was wide and shallow. Our 4 mlong trench excavated just over half of the width,
from spoil bank (berm) to spoil bank, of the acequia;
the channel itself may have been from 4-5 m wide.
The substrate is a mottled clay that appeared to
have served as the channel bottom; it would be
relatively impermeable so there was no reason to
prepare the canal bottom to prevent seepage. A
dense layer of cobbles were located on the creekside of the acequia trench that may be an intentional armoring of the downslope side of the canal
for reinforcement.
Evidence of the acequia is present along most
of its 2 km course from the dam to the point very

near the mission location where waters were
reclaimed into the Guadalupe River (Figure 4). The
acequia path was identified from spoil banks and a
channel depression, linear alignments of large trees
within the waterway, or, when no surficial evidence
was available, the topography of the landscape. In
the segments where the acequia was not evident on
the surface, our methodology was to follow the
probable contours from the last known point; with
one notable exception, there were few instances
when this was necessary and when it was, we
seldom went more than 50 m without encountering
a recognizable segment of the acequia. The acequia
parallels the creek for more than half of its distance.
A large meander in Mission Creek, located
approximately l km from the dam, would have
been the most likely location for the acequia to
begin traveling away from the creek toward the
mission. Unfortunately, it was at this critical location
where erosion and modern plowing and farming
activities has obliterated 300 m of the acequia at
the surface. The topography dictates that the acequia
must travel further to the east in order to get around
the changes in elevation also present at this location.
The acequia then cuts across the landscape, parallels
the modern fields located on the Guadalupe River
to the east of the mission, and appears to empty into
the river. Two possible acequia laterals were
identified based on anomalies from early aerial
photographs, but were not actually located on the

surface; modern fanning may have obliterated any
surface evidence of them. The overall gradient of
the acequia is 0.7 percent. This slope is excellent
to maintain channel integrity, but might result in
slight to moderate sedimentation. The maintenance
that this implies may explain the height of the
spoil banks in some segments of the acequia; muck
from the channel would have been placed
immediately to the sides of the channel, or on the
spoil banks.
The Mission Creek acequia crosses four soil
types in its course (Figure 5). The soil into which
the first half of the acequia is excavated is Straber
loamy fine sand. According to Miller (1982:32),
the permeability is low, runoff is slow or medium,
and the hazard of water erosion is slight. Present
uses of this soil type include primarily range and
pasture lands, and the acidity of the soil may have
prevented the growth of certain types of crops.
Therefore, the likelihood of small field areas along
the length of t~e acequia is low. The second soil
type through which the acequia courses is Valeo
clay loam. Permeability is moderate, surface runoff
is medium, and the hazard of water erosion is
moderate to severe (Miller 1982:35). This soil is
also the exact location where severe erosional gullies
have helped to obliterate evidence of the system.
We could conjecture that erosion in this area may
have contributed to the eventual abandonment of
the irrigation system on Mission Creek. The third

128

Texas Archeological Society

and fourth soil types are Meguin silty clay
and Sinton loam. These soils are nearly
level and located along the floodplain of
major rivers. Flooding is frequent and these
soils are inundated once every 2-8 years.
Permeability is moderate, runoff is slow,
and the hazard of water erosion is slight
except in areas subject to stream bank
caving. Both the Meguin and Sinton are
extremely well-suited for farming and have
the highest rating potentials for grain and
seed crops (Miller 1982).
Based on investigations conducted in
the field and archives, we propose the following scenario for the irrigation system
at mission Nuestra Senora del Espiritu
Santo de Zuniga. The provisions supplied
from the Rio Grande and San Antonio
missions were not sufficient, and Rivera
made the recommendation in 1727 to initiate irrigation efforts in the area. The first
attempts were made on the Guadalupe
River, and a substantial diversion dam was
constructed. Due to the topography, the
acequia had to very closely follow the
Figure 4. Course of the Mission Creek acequia toward the
river for quite a distance, and was probGuadalupe River and the mission location. Dotted line represents

segment of acequia destroyed by modem farming.
rain. Efforts after some unknown time on
the Guadalupe were abandoned, and a less torrential, more manageable water source was chosen. A
second diversion dam and acequia system were
0.5
kilometers
constructed on nearby Mission Creek. Irrigation
efforts were tried for some time before they were
eventually abandoned in 1736. Reasons for the
abandonment of the Mission Creek system could
have been any combination of the following: (1)
severe erosion problems in the mid-section of the
acequia; (2) water availability in Mission Creek
was too low during the dry months; (3) realization
that rainfall would provide the needed water for
dry farming; and/or (4) realization that livestock
prospered on the lands.

TREE-RING RECORD

The above interpretation of the acequia system
was completed only from the historical and technological analyses. After these were complete, the
local tree-ring record was reviewed; tree-ring
records are available nearby from Coleto Creek and

a generalized record is available for the region
(Stahle and Cleaveland 1988). This record is based
on post oak (Quercus stellata) from living trees and
specimens preserved in log cabins (Stahle and Herr
1984; Therrell n.d.).
Stahle and Cleaveland (1988, 1993), Stahle
et al. (1998), and Therrell (n.d.) have demonstrated
that post oak tree ring width correlates well with
both the June Palmer Drought Severity Index
(JPDSI) and the Southern Oscillation. In both cases,
narrow tree rings reflect dry conditions and wide
rings represent wetter years. Figure 6 shows the
tree ring width index for the years from 1725-1750
for Coleto Creek and the generalized South Texas
records. As all tree ring widths become systematically narrower with declining growth rates and
larger tree diameters as the tree ages, tree ring width
indices provide a standardized measurement to account for this systematic decline in ring width. Although the South Texas and Coleto Creek tree ring
width indices vary during any specific year, both
show similar dry and wet periods. As the Coleto
Creek tree is closer to the mission, its record is
relied on to a greater degree in this analysis. However, as the recent flood of October 1998 sadly
demonstrates, the Guadalupe River has a large
catchment basin that extends far into the western
portion of Central Texas, and flooding in the downstream portion can occur due to heavy rains in any
portion of its catchment basin. For this reason the
generalized South Texas tree ring indices are also
shown. In addition, the June PDSI reconstructions
are presented to provide a measure of drought and
wetness intensity (Figure 7).
The tree-ring data substantiates our interpretation of the sequence of activities remarkably well.
In the South Texas record, 1726 and 1727 were
average rainfall years (between -1 and + 1 JPDSI);
however, at Coleto Creek, the tree ring indices indicate it was much wetter than the regional record.
It was during this time that the mission was moved
to the Guadalupe River, and Rivera recommended
irrigation efforts there. Therefore, the conditions in
which they had observed the Guadalupe River were
during an average regional period and during a
locally wet period. During this 25 year period in
the South Texas June PDSI record, 17 years were
either wet or dry (less than -1 or greater than +1),
and only nine years fall between +1 or -1. Thus,
while these years were mathematically average,
they were not common. The Spanish perceptions

of the utility and manageability of the river would
have been skewed by these average-to-wet rainfall amounts.
The period from 1728-1732 were dry years
locally and regionally. We suggest, as postulated
from the technological analysis of the acequia
system, that the Guadalupe River dam was
constructed during this dry period. The area then
experienced three alternating wet and moderately
dry years from 1733 to 1735. The acequia system
on the Guadalupe River could have been washed
out by high water, especially in 1735, that need not
have been a result of locally heavy rainfalls. This
scenario suggests a longer use-history of the
Guadalupe dam and acequia than implied in the
technological analysis. In 1733 and 1735 moderate
local rainfalls are suggested by the Coleto Creek

tree ring record. We propose that it was during this
period when the Mission Creek dam was probably
constructed. Water levels in Mission Creek would
have probably been reliable during this period in
order to provide the acequia system with enough
water. In 1736, however, the tree-ring records
suggest that conditions were dry and possibly so
little rainfall fell that Mission Creek dried up, and
the acequia did not flow. This is the exact year
Bolton ( 1915) indicates attempts to irrigate were
abandoned. The next year (1737) was wet enough
to favor dry-farming, followed by a year of likely
water availability problems for dry-farming; 1739
and 1740 were two years of wet conditions when
dry-farming would have been productive, and
irrigation would no longer have been necessary.
The following six years were dry as indicated by
the Coleto Creek tree-ring record, and the next year,
1747, was wet.
Therrell (n.d.) has demonstrated that the South
Texas post oak record is reflected in the AngloAmerican historic observations on weather and climate in the mid-19th century. Our interpretation of
this tree-ring record suggests that minor variations
in climate directly affected the Spanish colonial
and Native American farming practices at Mission
Espiritu Santo de Zuniga in Texas. Stahle et al.
(1998) have made a similar case for the abandonment of the Lost Colony of Roanoke (1587-1589)
in North Carolina and the high mortality and near
abandoment of Jamestown, Virginia (1606-1612).

SUMMARY
Historic records, technological analyses of the
irrigation system, and tree-ring evidence have been
combined to propose a sequence of construction,
use, and abandonment of the irrigation systems at
the Mission Espiritu Santo de Zuniga, Victoria
County, Texas. The acequia system was constructed
on the Guadalupe River during a drought period
when water levels in the river were low. Terrace
topography and bedrock morphology limited the
potential dam sites and forced the placement of the
acequia near the river. A series of wet years, especially in 1735, resulted in flooding that may have
destroyed the acequia system along the Guadalupe
River, but favored its relocation along Mission
Creek, a intermittent tributary of the Guadalupe
River. The acequia system on Mission Creek was

dependent on its consistent flow. Even after a series
of locally wet years in 1733 and 1735, this system
was abandoned in favor of dry-land farming. Historic records indicate it is unlikely that the acequia
system was ever used after 1736.

The Spanish Colonial Missions of Espiritu Santo (41GD1)
and Nuestra Senora del Rosario (41GD2), Goliad, Texas:
Exploring Patterns of Ethnicity,
Interaction, and Acculturation
Robert A. Ricklis

ABSTRACT
Recent excavations at the mission sites ofEspfritu Santo (41GD1) and Rosario (41GD2) provided large
samples of colonial period artifacts and fauna, along with limited samples of macrobotanical remains. The
excavations in two different midden areas at Espfritu Santo show differences in the proportional representation
of some artifact classes, indicating spatial variability in the colonial period assemblage at that site. At Rosario,
a stratified series of middens was found to overlie a colonial wall foundation and associated floors, indicating
the existence of at least one previously unrecorded building outside the main mission compound. Majolica
typological data, in conjunction with the documentary record, suggest that the lower middens at Rosario date
prior to 1780, while the upper midden dates to between ca. 1790 and the closing of the mission in 1806. Changes
in artifact assemblages at this site suggest modifications in Native lithic technology, notably a marked decline
in the production of traditional tool types, probably as imported metal implements replaced those of Native
manufacture. Comparisons of the Native pottery assemblages from the two sites indicate distinctly different
ceramic traditions, that at Espiritu Santo linked to the Late Prehistoric bone-tempered plainware tradition of the
inland Toyah horizon, and that at Rosario linked to the sandy paste, asphaltum-decorated Rockport ware series
of the central Texas coast Based on the findings, several inferences are made concerning the ethnicity of Native
groups, their mobility patterns, economic activities, and patterns of interaction.

INTRODUCTION
The investigations reported here were carried
out under the auspices of Coastal Archaeological
Studies, Inc. during 1997 and 1998. Our primary
goals were to define patterns of adaptation at the
missions and to explore the kinds of changes which
took place in Native American culture in response
to the novel opportunities and constraints inherent
in mission life. This article presents a general summary of the findings, with an emphasis on those
aspects of artifact assemblages and depositional
contexts most relevant to an understanding of the
cultural processes that operated at these missions
during the latter part of the 18th and very early
19th centuries (detailed descriptions of artifacts,
features, and additional data are contained in
Ricklis n.d.).

THE GOLIAD MISSIONS
IN CULTURAL AND
IDSTORICAL CONTEXTS
The mission of Espfritu Santo was originally
established in 1722 on Garcitas Creek, near
Matagorda Bay, for conversion of the Karankawan
tribes of the central Texas coast. Following a breakdown in relations with these coastal peoples, the
mission was moved inland to the lower Guadalupe
River in 1726 (Hindes 1995; Walter 1997; Walter
and Hester 1998; see also Hindes et al. and Walter,
this volume). Attendant upon changes in the geopolitical map of colonial Texas, Espfritu Santo was
moved to its final location on the San Antonio River
at present-day Goliad, Texas, in 1749 (Bolton 1915;
Chipman 1992). Concomitantly, the Royal Presidio
of La Bahfa, originally established near the mission

at its initial location, was moved first to the
Guadalupe River area and finally re-established
within 1 km of the final mission site, on the opposite bank of the San Antonio River (Figures 1 and
2).

Upon relocation to the Guadalupe River, the
missionary activities at Espiritu Santo were redirected from the coastal tribes to the Aranama and

Tamique, inland Native groups of the area. Initially,
both the mission and presidio consisted mainly of
wooden buildings and protective walls; excavations
conducted in 1940 at Espiritu Santo revealed post
molds and other evidence of the early wooden buildings and surrounding stockade. By 1758, the mission complex included a church and priests' quarters
of stone and mortar, and thatched roof jacales that
served as domiciles for resident Native people.
Herds of cattle and other livestock, the economic
mainstay of the Goliad missions, grew tremendously, reaching peaks of tens of thousands of head
by the 1780s. The wooden structures at Espfritu
Santo had been replaced by 1768 with stone buildings, including a sizable church, a granary, priests'
houses, and workshops. By 1786, the enclosing
wall was also made of stcne and mortar, with Indian jacal housing extending along the insides of
the walls (Mounger 1959:33). The mission continued to be occupied up until around 1830, although
it declined in population and general significance
during the early decades of the 19th century.
In 1754, the Spanish authorities made a fresh
attempt to bring the coastal Karankawans, with
whom relations had been generally hostile since the
1720s, into the sphere of colonial life and politics
(Bolton 1906, 1915; Gilmore 1984). To this end,
the Mission of Nuestra Senora del Rosario was
established in 1754 on a hilltop overlooking the
San Antonio River floodplain, some 6 km west of
Espiritu Santo and the Presidio of La Bahia (see
Figure 2).
As in the case of Espfritu Santo, the original
buildings at Rosario were of wooden construction,
although, as discussed below, our findings show
that stone foundations and adobe-brick floors were
incorporated into the construction effort. Excavations directed by Kathleen Gilmore in 1973-1974
yielded a wealth of information about the buildings
and construction phases at Rosario. At least two
episodes of church construction were documented,
and evidence for an early wood-post stockade enclosure was uncovered (Gilmore 1974a, 1974b).
Based on historical documentation, Gilmore defined several periods of construction at Rosario:
1. initial wooden construction, which lasted, apparently, until the time of the visit of inspection of Fray Gaspar de Solis in 1768;
2. construction of buildings and enclosing wall
of stone between 1768 and 1779. Gilmore's

Ricklis -

archeological work indicated a stone church
of this period, decorated with wall murals, as
well as various structures/rooms near the
church;
3. by 1780, Rosario was abandoned. The
Karankawans returned to their home territories along the coast because of "unreasonable
and cruel punishments ... and because the priests
wanted to constrain and deprive the Indians of
their liberty" (Reyes 1790); and
4. after a decade of abandonment, Rosario was
reopened by Fr. Reyes at the end of 1789.
Reyes initially officiated at a small, crude
chapel made of poles and thatch, but by 1791
the stone buildings and enclosing wall had
been rebuilt, and a new church with a secondstory loft, supported by a flying buttress, was
constructed (Gilmore 1974b:81).
With the reopening of Rosario, some of the
Karankawa returned to the mission. This coincided with a new phase of relatively peaceful and
cooperative interaction between the coastal groups
and Spaniards (Ricklis 1996), which also involved
the founding of a second Karankawa mission,
Nuestra Senora del Refugio (Oberste 1942; Ricklis
1996). At the request of the Karankawa themselves, Mission Refugio was initially established
in 1791 at the mouth of the Guadalupe River, near
the shore of San Antonio Bay. However, the location proved unsuitable to the Spaniards, and in
1795 Refugio was relocated to its final location on
the Mission River, where it functioned until 1830.
Rosario was officially closed in 1806-1807, when
its resident Native peoples were transferred to
Refugio (Gilmore 1974b).
Historically, it is well documented that both
Espiritu Santo and Rosario derived their primary
economic viability from extensive cattle ranching
(e.g., Mounger 1959; Myers 1969; Gilmore 1974a,
1974b; Jackson 1986; Thonhoff 1992; de la Teja
1995). Although limited agriculture was practiced,
rainfall was unreliable and the deeply entrenched
San Antonio River was unsuited to the acequia
irrigation technology of colonial times. Consequently, maize and other agricultural products often had to be purchased from the San Antonio
missions, where extensive irrigation made for more
reliable crop yields. Cattle, on the other hand,
thrived in the open grasslands of the coastal prairie

135

environment. At the time of its final relocation in
1749, Espiritu Santo owned some 3,000 head of
cattle; their number increased to some 15,000 by
1774, not counting "an incomparably greater number of unbranded" animals (Lopez 1940). Similarly, Rosario Mission's herd grew from 700 head
in 1754 to over 30,000 (including unbranded) by
1780 (Ramsdell n.d.)

THE NATIVE AMERICANS
Both the archeological and ethnohistorical
records indicate that the inland and coastal Native
groups associated, respectively, with the Espfritu
Santo and Rosario missions were ethnically and
linguistically distinct. Describing the region's Native peoples of the early 16th century, Cabeza de
Vaca was able to make clear distinctions between
coastal and interior groups (e.g., Campbell and
Campbell 1981; Covey 1983). Eighteenth century
Spanish colonial personnel consistently noted that
the Karankawan tribes of the coast could be readily
distinguished from inland groups on the basis of
language and a lifeway revolving significantly
around economic reliance on coastal food resources
(Newcomb 1983; Ricklis 1996).
Archeologically, the material cultures of the
coastal Karankawan peoples and various poorly defined inland coastal prairie peoples are represented
by distinct Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric assemblages. Many traits are shared by coastal and inland
archeological cultures during the Late Prehistoric,
including a lithic techno-complex consisting of
Perdiz arrow points, unifacial end scrapers, prismatic blade technology, and thin bifacial and sometime alternately beveled knives, plus limited ground
stone and bone industries.
It is in the respective ceramic assemblages that
the coastal and inland assemblages are readily distinguishable, primarily on the basis of rather consistent differen;:;es in ceramic attributes of paste
inclusions and surface treatment (Ricklis l 992a,
1995a). On the coast, pottery can be generally assigned to the Rockport ware series, the most diagnostic component of the Rockport phase, which can
be linked to the early historic Karankawa (e.g.,
Campbell 1961; Suhm and Jelks 1962; Corbin 1974;
Ricklis 1995a, 1995b, 1996). Typically, Rockport
ware consisted of small to medium-sized bowls,
jars, ollas, and bottle-like vessels that were coil-

and 5). Artifacts and faunal remains were abundant
at all depths. In each of the west slope units, a solid
sandstone bedrock was found at the base of the
midden deposits, indicating that prior to the colonial occupation the slope consisted of exposed bedrock ledges.
The midden on the northeast slope was relatively shallow, with a maximum thickness of approximately 30 cm. Once again, the matrix was a
silty soil. In this area, however, the midden rested
on Pleistocene clay rather than on bedrock, and
did not exhibit the complex lensing seen on the
west slope. Although artifacts were less abundant here than on the west slope, a significant
quantity were recovered, along with abundant faunal fragments.

ARTIFACTS
The artifacts recovered from
the two midden areas investigated at Espfritu Santo are listed
in Table 1. Because .laboratory
analyses have revealed no clear
trends in artifact forms or types
according to depths, vertical proveniences are not indicated in
the table. It can be seen, however, that there are some interesting differences in the relative
abundance of artifact classes between the two middens. By volume of excavated matrix, Native
ceramics are more abundant in
the west slope midden than on
the northeast slope, while flaked
lithic artifacts are relatively
more abundant in the latter area
than the former. Also, items of
non-utilitarian or ornamental
function (e.g., brass/copper ornaments and glass beads) are
relatively more abundant on the
west slope than the northeast
slope; in fact, while the former
midden yielded a range of nonutilitarian copper, brass, and
glass items, the latter produced
only three small glass beads.
Another apparent difference
in the material remains in the
two middens is the fact that nonNative or Spanish colonial ceramies were notably scarce on
the northeast slope. From the
west slope, 136 sherds of Spanish colonial pottery were recovered along with 2,468 sherds of
Native pottery; the ratio of Native to non-Native sherds is 18: 1;
in the northeast midden that ratio is double (36: 1).
While the reasons for these
differences are unclear, it is apparent that there is spatial variability in the kinds and relative
abundance of artifacts in extramural middens at Espfritu Santo.

The findings from the northeast midden give the
impression of less material wealth, both in the dearth
of non-utilitarian goods and in the relative scarcity
of non-Native imported colonial ceramics. Assuming that both middens represent debris largely generated by Native American residents at the mission,
it is possible that different Native groups within the
mission community had unequal access to imported
goods. Alternatively, it is possible that at least some
of the differences reflect a greater input of debris
from non-Native residents at the mission; in other
words, a larger proportion of the west slope midden
may represent the activities of resident Spanish personnel at the site than is the case with the northeast
midden. This possibility may find support in the

Our data on spatial variability
at the site are presently too limited for definitive answers to
these questions. They do, however, suggest that a spatially oriented analysis of assemblage
variability at the site may ultimately offer significant insights
into community layout and
questions of differential access/
use of material goods.
Although detailed descriptions of the many artifacts recovered in the 1997-1998
excavations are not possible in
this summary article, several
3
general observations can be
made on the nature of the material remains from Espiritu Santo.
As may be seen in Table 1, the
most abundant class of artifact
is Native pottery (Figure 6), virtually all of which falls into the
category of Goliad ware.
Goliad ware, defined on the
basis of large samples from this
site excavated during the 1930s and 1940s (Mounger
1959), consists for the most part of small to medium-size plain bowls, jars, and ollas with smooth
surfaces, and the virtually consistent use of more or
less abundant crushed bone temper. Similar pottery, usually also identified as Goliad ware, has
been recovered from the previous location of
Espiritu Santo (41VTl1) on the lower Guadalupe
River in Victoria County (Walter 1997; see also
Walter, this volume), as well as at mission sites in
the San Antonio area (e.g., Fox et al. 1976; Dial
1992) and at non-mission colonial sites in South
Texas, such as Rancho de las Cabras (41WN30) in
Wilson County (Ivey and Fox 1981; Taylor and
Fox 1985:27). Goliad ware is also abundant at the

site of Presidio de la Bahfa (41GD7), where it was
probably used by non-Native personnel as a readily
available, locally made utilitarian pottery (Anne Fox,
1998 personal communication). Goliad ware closely
resembles the Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric bonetempered plainware of the Toyah horizon, and it is
virtually certain that is represents an early historic
continuity in an inland coastal prairie ceramic tradition that was rooted in the Late Prehistoric period.
While Mounger identified decorated sherds in
her Goliad ware series (e.g., Goliad Black-on-Buff,
which was decorated with asphaltum paint, and
Goliad Red-on-Buff), these were extremely scarce,
comprising no more than a few dozen sherds in a
sample of thousands of sherds (Mounger 1959).
Thus, it is not surprising that in our total sample of
2,792 sherds from Espiritu Santo, only five bore
decoration in the form of asphaltum paint. In the
sample of 230 rim sherds, only a single specimen
bore asphaltum decoration.

The Native ceramics at Espfritu Santo exhibit a
distinctive set of attributes. In the 230 rim sherds
that had an attribute analysis, it was found, based
on rim profiles, that the most common vessel form
(31 percent) was a shallow bowl; deep bowls, at 24
percent of the sample, were less common. Jars were
represented by straight-walled and everted rim
forms (12 and 22 percent of the rim sherd sample,
respectively). Vessel orifice diameters, estimated
on the basis of rim sherd curvatures, ranged from 535 cm. Only seven percent have diameters greater
than 25 cm, indicating that, despite the presumably
sedentary lifeway of Natives at the mission, vessels
were rather small. Simple loop handles were added
to some vessels, with attachment effected by "riveting" the ends of the handle through holes in the
vessel walls. Most vessels were fired in an oxidizing atmosphere, resulting in surfaces ranging in
color from buff to orange-red or pinkish-red. Firings were apparently of short duration, given that
oxidation was in most cases incomplete, as sherd
interiors are dark gray in color. Clay bodies were
tempered with crushed bone, often in profuse quantities, and were generally devoid of other aplastic inclusions, with only four percent of the analyzed
rimsherds containing sand.
Lithic artifacts were flaked from local cherts
and, in a minority of cases, pale brown or purple
quartzite. Artifact forms include arrow points, all
of the triangular-to-lanceolate Guerrero type (e.g.,
Hester 1980; Turner and Hester 1993) with the
exception of a single round-base specimen (Figure
7a-e,j). Guerrero arrow points, ubiquitous on southern Texas mission sites, appear to have largely replaced earlier forms such as Perdiz by the 18th
century; for example, the Guerrero type was predominant at 41 VTll, the previous location of
Espfritu Santo Mission (Walter 1997).
Eleven flakes bear steep unifacial edge retouch
suggesting use as scrapers. It is notable, however,
that our sample contains no examples of the
"classic" round-ended unifacial end scrapers so
commonly found on Late Prehistoric sites in the
region and still present in significant numbers at
41VTl1 (see Walter 1997). Another lithic tool form
common in Late Prehistoric assemblages but absent
from our sample from Espiritu Santo is the flaked
drill or perforator. I infer that these tools had been
largely replaced by metal forms. Prismatic blades
(Figure 8) were fairly abundant, indicating
technological continuity from earlier times.

Six gunflints were recovered, four from the
west slope midden and two from the northeast slope
midden (Figure 9). All are rectangular in outline
and made from flakes of local cherts.
Non-Native ceramics include tin-enamel glaze
majolicas (Figure 10) and a variety of other wares,
mostly low-fired lead-glaze earthenwares and
slipped burnished wares. A single sherd of Chinese
porcelain was recovered from the west slope. All of
the majolica sherds assignable to known types come
from the west slope midden; the four types represented are San Agustin Blue-on-White (42 percent),
Huejotzingo Blue-on-White (8 percent), Puebla
Blue-on-White II (25 percent), and San Elizario
Polychrome (25 percent); the latter has blue designs on white, with thin dark brown accents in the
blue motifs. These types are typical of the colonial

period of the latter part of the 18th century (e.g.,
Dial 1992; Texas Archeological Stewardship Network 1997; Anne A. Fox, 1998 personal communication). Interestingly, none of several multi-colored
polychrome majolicas characteristic of the period
after 1790 are present (nor are the diagnostic colors
such as green, orange, yellow, or pale blue background, on the many sherds too small to type),
suggesting that the west slope midden was deposited largely or entirely during the earlier decades of
occupation at Espiritu Santo.
Glass fragments represent both bottles and flat
panes (see Table 1). The glass bead sample consists
almost entirely of small beads of various colors and
types typical of the latter part of the 18th century in
Texas and adjacent areas (e.g., Gregory and Webb
1965; Brain 1979; Harris n.d.). The single artifact
of reworked glass is a small Guerrero arrow point
(see Figure 7i) flaked from a fragment of aquamarine-colored bottle glass. Metal artifacts include several iron implements, an iron button bearing the

date 1783, wrought nails, and a flintlock. Copper
and brass items include five cut sheet fragments, a
brass arrow point, a possible copper arrow point, a
smaH fragment of copper casing, and a copper utensil (spoon?) fragment.
The variety of ornamental objects (Figure 11)
include brass earring loops, a small brass "hawk"
bell, an undecorated copper button, a molded flat
teardrop-shaped brass piece that may be the backing or setting for a gem, a small fragment of a
copper cross with an inset blue glass faceted gem,
two faceted jet rosary beads (one square, the other
diamond-shaped), and a non-Native ceramic bead
fragment (see Table 1). An additional seemingly
non-utilitarian item is comprised of two small

of burnished Spanish colonial Tonala ware, and the
other made from a fragment of grayish-white mortar or plaster.
The west slope midden yielded 299 fragments
of wall plaster, which, as mentioned above, presumably represent debris generated by repair or
reconstruction of buildings within the mission
compound. The smooth, finished side of 15 of
these fragments are unpainted. Of the remaining
pieces, 192, or 64 percent of the total sample, are
white-washed and 92 (31 percent), are painted a
deep red color. It is interesting that approximately
one-third of the plaster fragments bear red paint,
perhaps reflecting the practice of painting the
lower parts of interior walls red (as is in fact
exhibited in the restored church and other buildings at the site).

FAUNAL REMAINS
Faunal bone was abundant in all excavation
units in both middens. By far the greatest bulk of
this material is comprised of fragments of bovid
bone. The variation is size suggests both adult
animals of different sizes as well as the butchering
of juvenile cattle. Also present are chicken and
possibly turkey (wild?), opossum, rabbit, whitetailed deer, turtles, and a small quantity of fish.

INVESTIGATIONS
AND FINDINGS AT
ROSARIO MISSION
(41GD2)
As at Espfritu Santo, our
1997-1998 investigations at
Rosario Mission involved excavations outside the main mission compound wall. In
contrast to Espiritu Santo, no
restorations have been attempted at Rosario, and the
stone compound wall and interior church and other buildings
are in ruins, with only the lower

In the pair of contiguous

approximately 30 cm of midden

later years of mission occupation.
By far the most informative

found in the main excavation
block, the northern and western
limits of which were, respectively,
along grid lines Nl and El2. From

of the south compound wall, judging by surface
indications of dark-stained, organically-enriched
soil, animal bone fragments, chert flakes, pottery
sherds, and occasional other artifacts. In fact, our
excavations suggest that the lobe of high ground
extending south and southeast from the gate (see
Figure 12) is in large part the result of accumulation of anthrogenic debris and sediment during the
period of mission occupation. The excavations in
general revealed remarkably intact colonial deposits, almost entirely lacking in modern debris and
exhibiting, in the area of the main excavation block,
a clear stratigraphy and a series of architectural
features at the base of the midden deposits.
In the two units directly grid south of the gate
(S7E2 and S 15E2), an essentially undifferentiated
midden of dark brown silty soil containing numerous bone fragments and colonial period artifacts
was found to be some 50-70 cm thick. The midden
lay directly on a culturally sterile A-horizon brown
silty soil, which in turn rested unconformably on
red Pleistocene clay. No stratigraphy was discernible in these units, although a lens of charcoalstained soil and large bone fragments was noted at

Zone 1. This was a dark
brown silty soil containing
profuse quantities of cultural debris in the form of
Native and Spanish colonial artifacts, faunal remains, sandstone rubble
(mostly small, with lengths of fragments 10
cm or less, but with scattered larger rocks),
and bits of caliche. Zone l was generally
about 30 cm thick. In the northern part of the
block (and including NOE6 and NOE7), Zone
1 rested directly upon a stone wall foundation
and/or associated artificial floors at the base
of the colonial deposits. A dense bone bed
marked the base of Zone 1, although the bone
density decreased markedly in the southern
part of the block excavation (Figures 14 and
15). As discussed below, time-diagnostic majolica types associated with Zone l suggest
its deposition after ca. 1790.
Zone 2. This zone, comprised also of silty
midden soil, was distinguishable on the basis
of its slightly lighter color and more abundant
small bits of caliche. It directly underlay Zone
1 within the block excavation, south of an
east-west line running approximately along
grid line S 1. As may be seen in Figure 13,
Zone 2 is thickest, up to 25-30 cm, in the
southern part of the block and thins out to the
north. A bone bed up to 10 cm thick was

found within Zone 2 in the southern part of
the excavation block (Figure 16). The late
majolica types found in Zone 1 are absent in
Zone 2, except for a single small sherd of
early 19th century Tumacacori Polychrome
that is probably intrusive.

Zone 3. This zone, which was generally no
more than 10 cm thick, underlay Zone 2 in the
southern part of the excavation block. It consisted, again, of a silty midden soil, but with a
distinctly lighter/softer consistency than Zone
2, perhaps due to the inclusion of larger
amounts of ash. Like Zone 2, Zone 3 was

Zone 3-A. This was initially detected in unit
S6El2. In parts of this unit, Zone 3-A was
continuous with Zone 3, while in other parts
of the unit, and in other units in general, it
underlay the packed caliche floor that lay at
the base of Zone 3 (and at the base of Zones l
and 2 toward the north). Zone 3-A was quite
thin (generally only about 5-8 cm thick) and
contained only scattered cultural material. It
is the only cultural zone that predates the
architectural features described below; all other
midden strata were found above these features.
Zone 4. This is the culturally sterile, brown
silty A-horizon soil found to underlie the colonial period deposits everywhere in our excavations. It generally was approximately
30-40 cm thick, and rested unconformably on
red Pleistocene clay.

ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES
These consisted of a series of parallel features
(Figures 17 and 18):
1. A wall foundation made of small-to-medium

sized angular pieces of uncut sandstone
embedded in a red clay mortar, and in places a
lime-sand mortar. The foundation was

146

generally about 60 cm wide and only one stone
thick. The top of the stones were quite level,
suggesting that this feature is a complete
foundation rather than the bottom of a
dismantled higher stone wall. The relatively
small size of the stones (compared to those
seen in walls of the church and the compound
enclosure at the site), and the thinness of the
foundation, suggest that it was not designed to
carry a heavy load; most likely it served to
support some kind of wooden superstructure.
2. A packed caliche and red clay floor, apparently associated with the stone foundation,
was adjacent to (and a few cm lower than the
top of) the south edge of the stone foundation and extended to and apparently beyond
the southern limits of our excavation block.
For the most part, this floor was made of
packed caliche, but it also contained patches
of red clay throughout. The floor was thickest to the north near the stone foundation and
thinner toward the south (see Figure 13). This
floor dipped slightly to the south, following
the slope of the buried soil surface (as may

be seen in Figure 13, the present ground surface appears to be more or less level due to
the thicker accumulation of midden toward
the south).
3. A 2 m wide section of the same floor was
made of adobe bricks set in a mortar of red
clay; this is the same red clay found between
the foundation stones and in the packed caliche floor, and doubtless it was dug from the
Pleistocene clay deposit at the site. The surface of the adobe floor was flush with the
surface of the adjacent packed caliche floor
section, indicating that the same prepared living surface is represented. The adobes were
rectangular, some 10-15 cm thick, and ranged
in length from approximately 15 cm to as much
as 40 cm. Most were made from a mixture of
lime and native clay soil and were grayishwhite in color. Others were made primarily of
dark brown clay.
4. A series of shallow post support holes, all
around 20 cm in diameter and no more than
5-7 cm deep from the surface of the caliche

floor. These were basin-shaped and filled
with a dark-colored midden soil that was
readily discernible in the grayish-white surface of the surrounding floor. All were found
immediately to the south of, and aligned parallel to, the adobe brick floor section.

147

The fact that all of these architectural elements
run parallel to the nearby stone compound wall
suggests a planned integration into the overall layout of the mission. The complete size and floor
plan of the structure will only be determined by
additional excavation in the area (an attempt to
trace the stone foundation using ground-penetrating radar was unsuccessful, probably due to the
thinness of the foundation and the presence of rubble
within the overlying midden). It is likely, however,
that the caliche/clay and adobe-brick floor south of
the stone foundation was within a covered and perhaps enclosed space, given the presence of post
supports arranged parallel to, and located some 4 m
to the south of, the wall foundation. The presence
of adobe-brick flooring in the area between the post
supports and the foundation may indicate relatively
intensive activity there, since the adobes presumably would have provided a stable surface resistant
to treadage. The thinner caliche-clay floor to the
south of the post supports may have been an unenclosed space (e.g., a ramada), given that the floor
slopes to the south and would have drained rainwater and runoff in that direction.
The clay-filled ditch or trench along the north
edge of the wall foundation may have served as a
drainage ditch. This is suggested by its location
along and parallel to the wall foundation, where it
would have caught runoff from whatever form of
roof covered the associated structure and channeled
it onto the lower ground to the east. At some point
in time, the ditch was filled with clay mixed with
bits of caliche and lime mortar, possibly in conjunction with the construction of the packed red

5. A narrow ditch, adjacent and parallel to the
north edge of the stone foundation, filled with
red clay containing bits of caliche and lime.
This intruded into the underlying A-horizon
silty soil (Zone 4), and had a U-shaped profile
(see Figure 13).

6. A packed clay floor north of the stone foundation, some 8-15 cm thick and made of the
same native red clay used in the foundation
and other floors. This floor rested directly on
the Zone 4 A-horizon brown silty soil.

clay floor north of the wall foundation. If this was
in fact the case, it is possible that the original structure then was abandoned, with the wall foundation
and associated superstructure serving to partially
enclose the space to which the red clay floor pertained. Thus, while speculative given our limited
exposure of these features, the space between the

wall foundation and the main stone compound wall
may have been roofed over to form a new enclosed
space. This at least makes sense in view of the fact
that the distance between the two walls was approximately 5 m, which approximates the common
width of Spanish colonial domestic dwellings (e.g.,
de la Teja 1995:46).

DEPOSITIONAL
CHRONOLOGY

MAJOLICA TYPES AND
CHRONOLOGY OF THE ZONES

The midden stratigraphy, and the distinct
architectural floors, along with the presence/absence
of certain time-diagnostic majolicas and data from
historical records, permit a rather fine-tuned
chronology for the depositional sequence in the
main excavation block. Clearly, all colonial period
deposits rest on the A-horizon soil of Zone 4. Aside
from a probably brief initial deposition of cultural
debris and anthrogenic soil represented by Zone 3A, the first use of the area encompassing our
excavation was for formal structures represented
by the exposed architectural features. That these
features represent a relatively early building phase
in the mission's history is clear, given that the
foundation and associated floors are completely
covered by at least three strata of later colonial
midden material. As noted above, the relatively
small stones and thinness of the foundation suggest
that it supported a wooden superstructure, which
would be in keeping with records that indicate
that the earliest structures at the mission were of
wood construction (Kress and Hatcher 1931;
Gilmore 1974b).
At some point, the structure(s) represented by
the foundation and floors were abandoned, and the
area was used for general trash disposal. This is
indicated by the bone beds and the profusion of
broken/discarded artifacts and small pieces of sandstone rubble found in the overlying Zones 1, 2, and
3. Feature 5, a pit oval in plan (see Figure 18) and
possibly used for storage, originated from the base
of Zone 1 and intruded through the adobe and limeclay floor to penetrate the underlying A-horizon
soil. The fill of this feature consisted of dark brown
silty midden soil as well as artifacts and fauna!
bone fragments of the sorts found in the middens,
but contained no materials which would offer clues
to its specific function.
For the most part, the artifact samples from
Zones 3 and 3-A are too small for statistically
meaningful comparisons with other zones. On the
other hand, the presence of late majolica types in
Zone 1, and their absence in the underlying
middens, justifies a bipartite separation between
Zone l and the combined findings in Zones 2, 3,
and 3-A; these divisions constitute two useful analytical units for chronological comparisons of material remains.

Zone 1 yielded 535 fragments of tin enamelglazed Spanish colonial majolica, while a total of
164 fragments were recovered from combined zones
2 and 3 (see Figure 10 for selected examples). Of
these, 190 fragments from Zone 1 and 47 from
Zones 2/3 can be assigned to established types
(Anne A. Fox, 1997-1998 personal communication; also see Dial [1992]; Hard et al. [1995]; and
Texas Archeological Stewardship Network [1997]
for type descriptions and estimated temporal
ranges). As may be seen in Table 2, and as presented graphically in Figure 19, the type with the
earliest estimated time range, San Agustin Blueon-White, comprises 55 percent of the Zone 2/3
sample, but only 11 percent in Zone 1. Conversely,
San Elizario Polychrome, with an estimated time
range in the second half of the 18th century, comprises 36 percent of the Zone 2/3 sample and 52
percent of the Zone 1 sample. Perhaps most informative is the fact that 17 percent of the typable
majolicas from Zone 1 are late types (San Diego,
Monterey, and Tumacacori Polychromes plus
untyped late majolicas) that are estimated to date to
after 1790, or in the case ofTumacacori Polychrome,
after the tum of the 19th century. Only a single small
sherd of Tumacacori Polychrome came from Zone 2
and, given that this is the latest type found at the site,
it is likely that it was intrusive from the overlying
Zone l. To these typological breakdowns can be
added the fact that Zones 2 and 3 did not yield small
untypable sherds bearing the color combinations (e.g.,
greens, yellow, orange, brown) commonly found on
terminal 18th century/early 19th century types, and
that Zone 1 yielded a few sherds of whiteware typical of the early 19th century.
These significant shifts in the proportional representation and presence/absence of time-diagnostic types indicate that some time span separates
Zones 2/3 and Zone 1. As already noted, Rosario
Mission was abandoned around 1780, as the resident Karankawa became dissatisfied with life at the
mission, and the site was not reoccupied until the
end of 1789. Given that only Zone 1 is characterized by a significant representation of post-1790
majolicas, it is likely that it pertains to the final
years of mission operation between 1790 and 1806.
Zones 2 and 3 can be assigned, on the same
basis, to the period prior to abandonment in 1780.

butchering (deFrance, this volume). Other domestic

aquatic turtles, and three kinds of fish (gar, catfish,
and bass).

an unexpectedly low incidence of oak pollen in
samples from the middens analyzed by Albert (this

beans. Identified wild plant remains include seeds
of mesquite, scurfpea, thistle, and hackberry.

The chronological indicators in the artifact assemblages summarized above allow a consideration

of diachronic change in the material culture at
Rosario. The springboard for analysis is the kinds
and relative quantities of Native and imported Spanish colonial materials at the site, as measured in
terms of expected and actual percentages in the two
time periods represented by Zone 1 and Zones 2/3.
For the present purposes, the "expected"
representation of a given artifact class is based on
the relative quantities of excavated matrix in each
zone (treating combined Zones 2/3 as a single zone
or analytical unit). That this is a legitimate procedure
is indicated by the very close correspondences in
the relative percentages of some of the most
abundantly represented artifact classes (such as
Native pottery sherds, Spanish colonial pottery
sherds, and glass fragments) and the percentage of
excavated matrix represented for each zone. Thus,
for example, of the 12,052 Native pottery sherds
recovered in the three zones combined (excluding
the two westernmost units, where zone stratigraphy
was not discernible), 80 percent came from Zone 1
and 20 percent from Zones 2/3, while the
percentages of excavated midden for each zone are
78 percent and 22 percent, respectively. Similarly,
80 percent of the Spanish colonial ceramics and 77
percent of the glass fragments came from Zone 1,
with 20 percent and 23 percent, respectively, from

Zones 2/3. With a few notable exceptions, the
percentage breakdowns of other artifact classes are
more or less similar (Table 4 and Figure 23). These
data indicate that the middens in both analytical
units-Zone 1 and Zones 2/3reflect essentially the same depositional processes. In other words,
both analytical units appear to
represent general trash disposal
and a correspondingly more or
less broad range of materials and
activities at the site. It is unlikely

with the location of the middens
outside the main wall compound,
since in general Native people
lived either along the interior of
mission compound enclosures or
outside the compound, while
priests and other colonial personnel presumably resided in substantial buildings well within the
compound. Thus, while caution
is in order, it is reasonable to assume that significant shifts in the
proportions of various artifact
classes between zones are likely
to reflect, at least in large part,
changing patterns of material use
by Native peoples at the mission.
As shown in Table 4 and presented graphically in Figure 23,
the actual percentages of most
artifact classes fall within 10 percent of the expected percentages
for Zone 1 and Zones 2/3. Notably divergent are edge-retouched flakes, ornamental
artifacts, including glass beads,
and formal lithic tools (arrow
points, scrapers, thin biface
fragments). Of the total sample
of glass beads, which are quite
abundant, only 65 percent come
from Zone 1, while 35 percent
are from Zones 2/3. Artifacts of
personal adornment, including
non-Native items of dress such
as copper and brass buttons, diverge even more, with 50 percent of the total coming from
each of the zones.

CHANGES IN LITHIC
TECHNOLOGY AND TOOL
USE AT ROSARIO
The greatest divergence between Zone l and
Zone 2/3 is seen in formal lithic tools, with only 21
percent from Zone 1 and 79 percent from Zones 2/
3. While the sample is small, the nearly complete
absence of arrow points and scrapers from Zone l,
which yielded only a single arrow point preform

fragment, is striking. It is perhaps relevant, too, that
of the five arrow points found in the unstratified
midden in the two western units directly south of
the compound gate, four came from the bottom
one-third of the deposit. The presence of six bifaces
in Zone 1 should not be taken at face value, since
three specimens are thick flakes with bifacial edge
retouch (suggesting expedient rather than formal
tool production), while two may be distal fragments
of Archaic dart points that were curated/recycled
during the mission period. Only a single specimen
is a good candidate for the kind of thin bifacial

tools. Similarly, the percentages of utilized flakes,
which comprise 30 percent of the flake sample
from Zone 1 and only 17 percent from Zones 2/3,
points to an increased use of stone as expedient
tools, possibly as a compensation for a lack of
formal lithic tools. These findings essentially parallel those of Inman (1997, this volume) in her
analyses of lithic materials from the Spanish colonial missions at Guerrero in northeastern Mexico.
In sum, it appears that while a lithic technology continued to exist throughout the time span of
occupation at Rosario, there was a decrease in the
manufacture of aboriginal tool forms as Native
peoples increasingly incorporated implements of
non-Native origins/materials into their daily lives
at the mission. As a possible corollary, more reliance was placed on the use of expedient lithic

tools in the form of utilized and edge-retouched
flakes, as well as prismatic blades. Furthermore,
given that some fraction of the debitage in the
middens probably represents local manufacture of
gunflints (found in approximately the expected
percentages in the respective zones), the near absence of formal lithic tools in Zone l may actually
reflect an even greater reduction of traditional lithic
technology than is suggested by the quantities of
debitage in each zone.

CHANGES IN THE REPRESENTATION
OF NON-NATIVE ORNAMENTAL
ITEMS: THE EFFECTS OF
CHANGING SOCIO-POLITICAL
RELATIONS?
In contrast to the likely increase in the use of
metal for utilitarian purposes, there is a reduction
over time in the proportional representation of nonNative ornamental artifacts. Zone 1 produced 65
percent of the total number of glass beads, in contrast to the expected 78 percent. Of all other nonNative ornamental artifacts (see Table 4), only 50
percent are from Zone 1. While intuitively it may
be suspected th.at Native use of imported items of
personal adornment would have increased at the
expense of Native-made ornaments, other factors
help to understand the actual empirical data. Historical documentation shows that prior to 1790,
the Karankawan groups had only a tenuous link to
the mission and Spanish colonial culture; as noted
above, by 1780 relations had deteriorated to the
point that the Indians abandoned Rosario Mission.
By contrast, after 1789, when the Karankawa made

formal peace with the Spaniards, relations became
increasingly stable, so that by the first decade of
the 19th century the Karankawa were perceived
by colonial authorities as peaceful and useful allies (Ricklis 1996). Since clothing, blankets, beads
and other trinkets were commonly offered to Native peoples by missionaries to establish viable
relations (e.g., Silva 1791, 1793), it follows that
the custom of gift-giving was actually more commonly employed during the earlier period of tension than during the later years of relatively stable
and peaceful interaction. While this interpretation
of the data is at best tentative, it conceivably provides one basis for future archeological/archival
research into the material culture effects of changing socio-political relations during colonial times.
NATIVE CERAMICS AT THE
MISSIONS: PATTERNS OF
ETHNICITY AND
INTERACTION
In the preceding pages, the key attributes of
the Native pottery at Espiritu Santo and Rosario
have been briefly summarized. Even a cursory
examination of the pottery clearly shows that two
distinct ceramic traditions are represented by the
respective samples from these sites. At Espiritu
Santo, virtually all pottery recovered during our
investigations was plainware containing large
quantities of crushed bone temper. The similarity
of this material to pottery from Late Prehistoric
inland coastal prairie sites of the Toyah horizon,
as well as to the ceramics from the earlier location
of Espiritu Santo Mission (41VT11; see Walter,
this volume), leaves little doubt that it represents
the later end of a long continuum in ceramic technology and style.
By contrast, the pottery from Rosario shows
clear affiliation with the coastal Rockport ware
series, as should be expected if the Native people
at that mission were predominantly of Karankawan
ethnicity. Diagnostic attributes of Rockport warea sandy paste clay body, smooth vessel surfaces
that were commonly coated with asphaltum or
decorated with characteristic asphaltum designs
such as narrow bands on vessel lips and vertical
squiggles or wavy lines (Figure 25)-are abundantly represented at Rosario. Key attributes, as
quantified for rim sherd samples from the two
sites, are shown in Table 6.

159

Aplastic Inclusions:
Crushed Bone and Sand
While crushed bone is common in sherds from
both sites, it is more frequently present, and in
greater quantities, in sherds from Espfritu Santo. In
the sample from that site, there are no sherds without bone temper, and only 11 percent have sparse
bone temper, while moderate and profuse bone temper are found in 39 and 50 percent of the sherds,
respectively. At Rosario, 9 percent of the sherds
contain no bone, while sparse bone temper is found
in 43 percent of the sherds, moderate bone is in 41
percent, and profuse bone is in only 6 percent of the
sherds (Figure 26).
An even greater contrast is seen in the presence/absence and quantities of sand inclusions in
the sherd samples from the two sites. At Espiritu
Santo, 96 percent of the sherds are devoid of
sand inclusions, while sparse and moderate sand
is found in three and one percent of the sherds,
respectively. At Rosario, only eight percent of
the sherds are without sand inclusions, while
sparse, moderate, and profuse sand is found, respectively, in 22, 38, and 33 percent of the sherds
(Figure 27).
The data on aplastic inclusions indicate significant differences in the technology of clay selection/
preparation at the two sites. At Espfritu Santo, tempering was almost always accomplished by adding
crushed bone to the clay body, and the great majority of vessels were made from clay devoid of sand
inclusions. At Rosario, the overwhelming majority
of pots were made with clay selected for natural
sand inclusions (or with clay to which sand was
added as an intentional tempering agent; at this
time, without knowledge of the clay sources used,
it cannot be determined if sand was an intentional
additive). Bone was commonly employed as a tempering agent, but in smaller quantities than at
Espiritu Santo. At Rosario, ceramic technology
more closely approximates the sandy paste tradition of the coastal Rockport phase, insofar as the
great majority of vessels contained sand, and profuse bone tempering is found in only a small minority (5 percent) of the vessels. Still, bone
tempering was employed in most vessels (90 percent), in contrast to non-mission Rockport phase
sites, where it is found in only about 20-40 percent
of vessels (Ricklis 1995a, 1996:Appendix A).
The high incidence of bone tempering at
Rosario may reflect an influence (through as yet

obscure social and/or economic mechanisms) upon
the largely Karankawan potters at Rosario coming
from the distinctly different ceramic tradition established at Espiritu Santo. There is, in fact, some
evidence that the common inclusion of crushed
bone in the Rosario pottery increased through time,
suggesting an ongoing process of modification of
traditional Rockport (Karankawan) ceramic technology. As shown in Table 7, the quantity of
crushed bone is greater in Zone 1 than in the
earlier combined Zones 2/3. In the Zone 2/3
sample, 12 percent of the analyzed rim sherds
contained no bone, as compared to nine percent in
Zone 1. Sparse bone temper declines from 60 to
43 percent, while moderate and profuse bone temper increase, respectively, from 27 to 41 percent

and from two to six percent. Conversely, sand
inclusions in clay bodies decreases between Zones
2/3 and Zone 1: sherds with no sand represent
only three percent of the sample in Zones 2/3 and
10 percent in Zone 1. By contrast, 66 percent of
the sherds in the Zones 2/3 sample contain profuse sand inclusions, while the percentage for the
Zone l sample is only 16 percent.

Asphaltum Decoration/Coating
Aside from a single sherd from Rosario bearing two parallel, dark brown straight lines painted
in some substance (mineral paint?) other than asphaltum, all applied decoration in our Native ceramic sample was accomplished by painting
asphaltum onto fired vessel surfaces. Asphaltum
surface treatment was almost non-existent at
Espiritu Santo (Figure 28; see also Table 6); only a
single rim sherd bore asphaltum in the form of a
narrow band around the vessel lip.
In marked contrast, 43 percent of the analyzed
rim sherds from the Rosario sample bear asphaltum. Most commonly, this consists of a band
painted on the vessel lip, a common decorative
element of the Rockport Black-on-Gray ceramics
of the coastal Rockport phase (e.g., Campbell
1961; Suhm and Jelks 1962; Ricklis, 1992a, 1995a,
1996). Also present in the rim sherd sample are 20
specimens bearing vertical painted squiggles, a
highly diagnostic design element in Rockport ware.
The limited number of sherds bearing this element
is consistent with non-mission Rockport phase ceramic samples, and can be attributed to the fact
that: (a) generally only a minority of vessels at
any given site bear this design, and (b) the vertical
squiggles were placed at fairly wide intervals on
vessel exteriors (see Ricklis 1995a), so that the
element will not be present on many sherds from a
pot with this decoration.
To these data from Rosario, derived from the
analysis of rim sherds, can be added information
from a select sample of 768 body sherds from units
NOE6 and S1E12. In this sample, 333, or 43.4 percent, bore asphaltum coating and/or decoration.
Also, there is a correlation between the presence of
exterior asphaltum decoration (wavy lines,
squiggles) and interior asphaltum coating, as is the
case in ceramic samples from non-mission,
Rockport phase sites (see Ricklis 1995a, 1996:Appendix A).

In sum, in terms of the specific
decorative elements, as well as the
percentage of vessels bearing asphaltum surface treatment, the ceramics from Rosario compare well
with samples from Rockport
phase sites: at Rosario, 43 percent
of the analyzed rim sherds bear
asphaltum, while the analyses of
ceramics from seven Rockport
phase sites (Ricklis 1995a) show
asphaltum on between 38 and 65
percent of vessels, with an average of 53 percent. Given that the
Rockport phase is largely, if not
entirely, the archeological correlate of the historically documented
Karankawan groups (Campbell
1960; Newcomb 1961, 1983;
Ricklis 1996), these ceramic data
strongly suggest that Karankawan
peoples were the primary, if not
virtually the only, Native residents
at Mission Rosario (at least among
those responsible for the midden
debris outside the south compound gate).
The contrasting quantities of
asphaltum surface treatment on
vessels from the two mission sites
are shown graphically in Figure
28, with comparisons to non-mission Rockport phase sites and
Toyah sites located on the South
Texas coastal prairies. The similarities between Rosario and
Rockport ceramic samples on the
one hand, and Espiritu Santo and
Toyah pottery on the other, are
clear. Interestingly, the coastal
prairie Toyah sites have a significantly higher average percentage
(15 percent) of vessels bearing asphaltum surface treatment than
does Espiritu Santo (0.4 percent).
While analyses have shown that
the use of asphaltum for decoration on Toyah vessels involved
non-Rockport decorative elements
(Ricklis 1995a, 1996), it is apparent that Toyah potters on the

162

Texas Archeological Society

coastal prairies did have limited
access to asphaltum as a ceramic
decorative material. The contrasting percentages of asphaltum surface treatment on non-mission
Toyah sites and at Espfritu Santo
suggests that non-/pre-mission inland groups had greater access to
asphaltum, perhaps through trade
with coastal peoples, than did the
Native occupants at Espfritu Santo.
This in turn may indicate that life
at the missions was more restrictive regarding interaction between
Native peoples than was the case
under aboriginal conditions.

The dearth of handles at Rosario,

seem to agree with other historical and archeological
information suggesting that the Karankawa tended
to incorporate the mission into their seasonal rounds
as a basic ecological resource that provided beef and
maize as substitutes for the bison and plant resources
traditionally gathered on the coastal prairies (see discussion in Ricklis 1996:159-168).

SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS
The several points that emerge from the foregoing analyses can be summarized as follows:
1. Both the Espiritu Santo and Rosario Mission
sites retain essentially intact and highly
productive colonial period extramural
middens. The preponderance of artifacts from
these deposits are of Native American
manufacture, suggesting that they preserve
highly significant archeological records of
the Native occupations of these sites.
2. Differences in the relative quantities of various Native and Euro-American artifacts at
Espfritu Santo suggest as yet poorly understood spatial variability in the extramural
middens; the differences may reflect: (a) different degrees of access to imported non-Native artifacts by resident Native peoples, (b)
greater input of debris from non-Native people
in some midden areas, or (c) a combination of
these factors.
3. At both Espfritu Santo and Rosario, the abundance of bovid bone doubtless reflects subsistence based on the large cattle herds associated
with these missions. At the same time, the
presence of non-domesticated taxa indicates a
continuing partial reliance on wild game, reptiles, fish, and freshwater mussel.
4. The macro-botanical identifications indicate
the use of both plant domesticates (maize and
beans) and wild plants such as mesquite beans
and various other seeds, as well as pecans.
The lack of oak in the identified wood charcoal samples is somewhat surprising, and may
indicate that live oak motts, abundant in the
area today, were less common on the coastal
prairies during the 18th century (see Albert,
this volume).

5. The ceramic assemblages from the two sites
are clearly distinct, with the Goliad ware from
Espiritu Santo derived from the earlier bonetempered plainware tradition of the Toyah
horizon and the pottery at Rosario linked to
the coastal ceramics of the Rockport phase.
Given the marked technological and stylistic
differences, it would be erroneous to subsume
the Rosario assemblage under the rubric of
Goliad ware, since this would mask the
fundamental differences in the two ceramic
traditions. While the common use of bone
temper at Rosario suggests technological
influence from Espiritu Santo, the pottery
from this site generally contains less bone
temper and an abundance of sand. There
appear to be temporal trends in the Rosario
pottery in increasing quantities of bone
temper and decreasing amounts of sand in
clay bodies, suggesting a time-dependent
acceptance of technological aspects of the
inland bone-tempered ceramics, at least
within the mission context at Rosario.
Significantly, typical Rockport asphaltum
decoration is common at Rosario, suggesting
adherence by resident Karankawans to
traditional styles and, to the extent that these
unique stylistic features are ethnic markers
(see Ricklis 1992a, 1995a), a significant
retention of Karankawan ethnic identity
within the novel milieu of mission life.
6. The extreme scarcity of asphaltum decoration at Espiritu Santo, as well as a dearth of
vessels with sand inclusions, suggests that
there was little influence on potters at that
site from the Karankawan peoples at Rosario,
and also that few Karankawan vessels were
traded or otherwise transported to Espiritu
Santo. The use of asphaltum for decorating
vessels at Espfritu Santo is in fact markedly
less than at Late Prehistoric Toyah horizon
sites on the South Texas coastal prairie, indicating that interaction among Native ethnic
groups was probably more restricted than during aboriginal times. This may reflect social
constraints imposed by the organizational
structure of the Spanish colonial system, and
is not necessarily incongruent with the fact
that the Karankawan potters at Rosario were
influenced by the ceramic tradition practiced

Ricklis -

Spanish Colonial Missions of Espiritu Santo and Nuestra Seiiora del Rosario

165

at Espfritu Santo. At the latter mission, the
ceramic tradition was already an established
institution within the regional Spanish colonial system as the Native-made Goliad ware
pottery was incorporated into daily life as a
common utilitarian ware, including its use
by Spanish personnel (e.g., it is found in
abundance at Presidio de la Bahfa, Anne A.
Fox, 1998 personal communication). In other
words, while the dearth of Karankawan ceramic influence at Espfritu Santo may reflect
constraints upon the relations between Native peoples, the adoption by Rosario Native
potters of certain traits (common use of bone
temper, vessel handles) of the inland pottery
tradition may have been a response to the
dissemination of stylistic and technological information that had become an integral aspect of technological behavior and
material culture within the Spanish colonial community.

middens indicates that it pertains to the early
years of occupation at Rosario, and the alignment of the wall foundation, floors, and post
support holes parallel to the main wall compound suggest that the building was a planned
component in the overall layout of the mission. Further, the use of non-Native building
techniques (stone foundation, packed caliche
floors, adobe bricks) indicates that the structure was built by Spanish colonial personnel
or perhaps by Native workers operating with
novel technology directed by or learned from
Spaniards. The presence of a packed caliche
floor to the west of the main block, in units
NOE6 and NOE7, suggests the existence of a
second structure, and it is entirely possible
that a complex of outbuildings existed in the
area south of the main compound gate.

7. The diachronic analyses at Rosario suggest
two additional points. First, it is apparent
that the aboriginal lithic technology was
modified during the second half of the 18th
century, as traditional tool forms gave way
to a greater use of flaked stone "expediency"
tools (e.g., retouched and utilized flakes). Presumably, the decline in the use of formal
lithic tools reflects the availability and perhaps increasing accessibility of imported
metal implements. Second, there is a reduction in the proportional representation of glass
beads and other non-Native items of personal
adornment/dress between Zones 2/3 and Zone
1. Speculatively, this is thought to reflect a
corresponding reduction in gift giving as a
mechanism for facilitating inter-group relations, once socio-political relations between
Spaniards and Karankawans improved after
1790;and

A Comparison of Two Locations of Mission Espiritu
Santo de Zuniga and Mission Nuestra
Senora del Rosario, Texas
Susan D. deFrance

ABSTRACT
Excavation of three 18th century missions on the South Texas coastal prairie produced an abundance of
fauna! remains. These remains are associated with two different Native American populations that were
undergoing missionization by Franciscan missionaries. The Aranama and Tamique Indians inhabited the
Espiritu Santo de Zuniga missions along the Guadalupe, 41VTl1, and later they resided in Goliad, 41GD1.
A population of Karankawa Indians resided at Mission Nuestra Senora del Rosario, 41GD2. The
zooarcheological remains indicate that cattle ranching was an economic mainstay at all three sites; however,
evidence for variation in the use of local resources strongly relates to the ethnic composition of the missions.
Analysis of the fauna! assemblages included the collection of empirical data on butchering patterns and size
characteristics of the bovid remains represented in the archeological record and comparisons with other
geographic areas of Spanish settlement.

INTRODUCTION
Recent excavations at three Spanish colonial
missions on the south coastal plain of Texas have
expanded our understanding of the nature of colonial interaction between the indigenous populations
of the region and Catholic missionaries during the
18th and early 19th centuries (Ricklis 1998, this
volume; Walter 1997, this volume). One component of Spanish colonial missionization was the
introduction of Old World domesticates to mission
settings to provide both food resources and economic opportunities for the friars and native peoples
undergoing religious conversion. Both populations
had the ability to modify their diets to include new
subsistence items as well as the ability to exploit
new economic opportunities. Accommodation by
either parties would have constituted an alteration
of traditional foodways. Native populations could
have consumed barnyard domesticates from the Old
World, while the Franciscan friars would have been
able to consume a variety of wild fauna.
This article compares the patterns of faunal
use that characterize three archeological mission

contexts (Figure 1). Excavations at the missions
of Espiritu Santo de Zuniga at Goliad (1749-early
19th century) and Nuestra Senora del Rosario
(1748-early 19th century) by Ricklis (1998, this
volume) produced a substantial quantity of faunal
remains. On-going research at a prior location of
the Espiritu Santo mission (1726-17 49) on the
Guadalupe River (41VT11) also produced
abundant faunal remains. I analyzed, and include
herein, a portion of the faunal material that was
recovered from the 1995 excavation of a large
bone bed at the Guadalupe River location. The
history and archeological investigations of these
missions are only briefly reviewed here as they
relate to the faunal remains. The reader is referred
to Ricklis (1998) and Walter (1997) for additional
contextual information. Since two of the contexts
are from the Espiritu Santo Mission, the sites will
be referred to as Espiritu Santo (41VT11) and
Goliad or Espiritu Santo at Goliad.
This zooarcheological analysis consisted of the
selection of a range of archeological contexts from
which faunal remains would be examined. A variety
of measures of relative abundance were used to

determine which taxa were the most important food
resources. Additional information on the characteristics of the faunal assemblage-including bone
modifications and skeletal element representationwere obtained to provide information on how
animals were processed and consumed by the
mission inhabitants. Dimensional measurements of
individual bone elements were taken to determine
the size range of the large bovids present in the
assemblage. These data are compared with other
Spanish colonial assemblages from different
geographic areas to assess the effects of environmental variability on the size of Spanishintroduced livestock.
One of the goals of the faunal analysis is to
determine if the ethnic variability among the
missions resulted in different patterns of animal
use and discard. Comparisons of the three
assemblages are made to assess the effects that
ethnic background had on the composition of
the assemblage. At both locations of Espiritu
Santo, populations of Aranama and Tamique
Indians or inland groups resided in the mission
compounds. At mission Rosario, a program of
conversion was instituted for the coastal
Karankawa Indians.

The excavation strategies at
the three sites were aimed at uncovering undisturbed archeological deposits dating to either
the 18th and/or early 19th century mission occupations. All
three sites contained in situ deposits with large quantities of
faunal material. Criteria for the
selection of samples for analysis were the quantity of faunal
material recovered, the type of
archeological context, and the
temporal range of mission occupation represented by the faunal
remains.

Analyzed Contexts from
Espiritu Santo de Zuniga,
41VT11

A University of Texas at Austin field school
was conducted at this site during the 1995 summer
with additional excavations in November 1995.
Excavations were concentrated in an area of an
exposed knoll overlooking the Guadalupe River.
This area was to be impacted by bulldozer activity
for the preparation of the construction of a driveway
by the property owners. Uncovered and excavated
as a single cultural level was a dense bone bed that
was designated Feature 3.
Several contiguous units were excavated to
recover the bone refuse. Faunal material from
three excavation units (95-6, 95-9, and 95-14)
were selected for analysis. These units contained
dense deposits of bone. At 41VT11, non-volumetric samples were also screened with 1/16inch (2.0 mm) mesh screen to determine if
small-sized remains were not being recovered in
the 1/8-inch mesh. Fine-screened samples from
units 95-6 and 95-9 are included in the analysis.
All of the bone recovered in the 1/8-inch mesh
from the three units was combined analytically
for quantification purposes.
Vertebrate remains from six excavation units
in the area of probable indigenous settlement near
an anaqua grove were examined to determine if

deFrance -

additional species not identified from Feature 3
were present. Both the 118-inch and the 1116-inch
material were examined from these units. Although
the remains from these units were not quantified,
they include species not represented in Feature 3.

Analyzed Contexts from Espiritu Santo
de Zuniga at Goliad, 41GD1
Excavations at Espiritu Santo at Goliad were
concentrated in two areas of the site (Ricklis 1998,
this volume). The first was located on the wooded
hill slope west of the mission compound wall. The
four lxl m units excavated in this area all contained dense mission refuse dating to the mid-18th
century. One of the excavation units, S8EO, contained over 1 m of midden refuse. Although some
stratigraphic change was observed in the fill, the
material culture indicates that the deposit is chronologically undifferentiated mission-period refuse.
All of the faunal material from this unit was selected for analysis.
A second area where test excavations were completed is in the wooded area on the north slope
outside of the northeast corner of the mission compound. Two test excavations in this area indicated
that the midden deposit was very shallow with deposits not greater than 35 cm below the surface. In
Test Unit 6 a dense quantity of bovid bone was
uncovered. This deposit was dense enough to constitute a "bone bed." The faunal material from this
unit was selected for analysis.
Analyzed Contexts from Mission Nuestra
Senora del Rosario, 41GD2
The excavation strategy for Rosario mission
was also aimed at uncovering undisturbed deposits.
Surface exposure of archeological material and
shovel testing indicated that intact midden was
present south of the mission compound wall. A
series of excavations in 1997 were placed south of
the compound wall near the gateway to the complex (Ricklis 1998, this volume). The initial excavations uncovered two zones of intact mission
deposits dating to the late 18th century. Also uncovered in two adjacent squares (NOE12 and S1El2)
were a rock and mortar wall foundation to a previously unknown structure and a hard-packed caliche
floor. Dense faunal refuse was present in both zones.

171

These units were selected for faunal analysis.
Additional excavations were completed at the
site during 1997 and during the summer of 1998 in
the area of the floor and wall foundation. These
excavations uncovered additional midden from the
two stratigraphic levels (Zones 1 and 2) as well as a
deeper deposit of undisturbed midden (Zone 3) below the caliche floor dating to the initial occupation
of the mission during the 18th century. Faunal material from the three zones present in S4E13, S4E12,
and SSE 12 were analyzed to augment the zooarcheological sample.
Zooarcheological Methods
Several methods are used to characterize the
relative abundance of the vertebrate faunal remains
from the mission sites. The majority of the faunal
remains were dry-screened with 1/8-inch (4.0 mm)
mesh in the field. Additionally, volumetric bulk
soil samples of 15 liters were taken from various
levels and excavation units from both Goliad and
Rosario to assess whether remains from small-sized
taxa were excluded with the use of 1/8-inch mesh.
The volumetric samples were water-screened with
1116-inch (2.0 mm) mesh.
The faunal remains were identified using modern comparative skeletal collections at the University of Montana Natural History Museum, the
Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History,
and the Florida Museum of Natural History. All of
the remains were identified to the lowest taxonomic
level. A large quantity of the remains are bovid
elements that could not be identified to a specific
species due to the similarity in skeletal elements.
The genus designations Bos/Bison are used.
The faunal material from the bulk samples was
identified, but was not quantified in terms of relative abundance. Although the remains are not quantified, the identification of several additional taxa
that are represented by small-sized individuals provides some insights into procurement strategies
employed by the mission inhabitants.
The majority of the faunal remains (i.e., those
recovered with 118-inch mesh) were quantified using three measures of relative abundance. Number
of Identified Specimens (NISP) were determined
for all taxa with the exception of unidentified vertebrate fragments. Estimates of the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) were determined using

172

age, sex, paired elements, and size. Bone weight
was recorded for all of the categories of vertebrates
from Goliad and Rosario. Bone weights were not
recorded for 41VTI1. A large portion of the mission assemblages are bone fragments that could not
be identified to other than the class Mammalia. The
use of NISP in combination with the estimates of
MNI and bone weight are used in conjunction to
identify the economically most important taxa.
Bone modifications were recorded for the
assemblages. Modifications include butchering,
polish, and rodent or carnivore gnawing. Butchering
evidence includes hack marks, presumably with
larger implements, and cuts or smaller incisions.
One hypothesis concerning the use and processing
of animals in the mission setting is that metal tools
were adopted rapidly by the mission inhabitants.
Although a variety of lithic tools are present in the
assemblages, the use of stone tools in the mission
setting for animal processing may have been
abandoned following the introduction of superior
metal cutting tools by the Spaniards. In order to test
this hypothesis, all butchering evidence was
examined to determine if metal or stone tools were
used to produce the butchering marks present on
the skeletal elements. Walter (1997) examined the
41 VTl 1 material to distinguish metal from stone
tool cuts. Cuts made with metal tools are very
smooth and uniform the length of the cut. They also
tend to occur at an angle to the bone rather than
parallel to the bone cortex. In contrast, stone tools
will often produce multiple V or U-shaped incisions
that are wide in the middle and taper near the ends
(Fisher 1995; Walter 1997). The majority of metal
hacks could be identified without additional
magnification. A binocular microscope was used to
distinguish metal versus stone tool cut marks.
The representation of mammalian skeletal
elements can be used to determine if complete
carcasses were present at a site, and therefore, that
on-site processing took place. Alternatively, the
presence of only select skeletal elements suggests
that some type of off-site processing occurred.
Typically, the field dressing of large mammals
results in the transport to the occupation site of
only the meatiest portion of the carcass (i.e., the
axial elements), and the exclusion of the less meaty
skull and distal limb elements and feet. One question
related to mission occupation is whether the
inhabitants relied on Spanish-introduced cattle or
did the inhabitants instead hunt bison at some

distance from the missions? Presumably, hunted
bison would have been field dressed while cattle
would have been raised near the mission and
processed on-site. In order to determine if whole
animals were processed at the missions or if animals
were obtained through off-site hunting and
subsequently transported to the mission compounds,
the frequencies of skeletal elements of all bovid
remains was determined. The skeletal portions used
are cranial, axial, forelimb, forefoot, hindlimb,
hindfoot, and foot.
Cattle and bison are extremely difficult to distinguish on morphological features alone (Brown
and Gustafson 1979; Olson 1960). Despite sexual
dimorphism and age variation, bison are generally
larger-sized than cattle; therefore, size estimates
can help determine if bison remains are present in
the faunal assemblages. The size of Spanish-introduced cattle can also provide insights into the effects of environmental variability on cattle in various
New World settings. In order to determine the size
range of the bovids represented at the mission sites,
dimensional measurements were taken of all complete and fused bovid skeletal elements; measurements followed von den Driesch (1976).

ANALYSIS RESULTS

Espiritu Santo de Zuniga (41VT11)
The vertebrate faunal sample from the Feature
3 sample consists of 2607 elements representing a
minimum of 27 individuals. Table 1 provides information on the taxa identified, NISP, and estimates of the MNI. The sample consists of at least
nine mammals, unidentified bird remains, two species of freshwater turtles, and one element of freshwater catfish.
In regard to mammalian taxa, the greatest number of identifiable fragments (n=248) are those of
bovids, either cow (Bos) or bison (Bison). The second most common mammalian remains are those
of white-tailed deer (n=41). The other mammalian
faunal remains are small or medium-sized individuals that were probably hunted in the vicinity of the
mission. These include opossum, rabbit, and gray
fox. Also present is a single element (third rear
phalanx) of a bear, probably a black bear. The domestic non-native fauna include remains of either
sheep or goats. At least one burro is represented by

a tibia fragment. Although primarily used as beasts
of burden, this burro may represent food refuse
since a small cut is present on the shaft. A possible
domestic pig is also present in the faunal sample.
All other classes of vertebrates are poorly represented in the assemblage. Unidentified bird shafts
were present. Reptiles include a least two species
of turtles: soft-shelled turtles and pond turtles. The
only identified fish remains are those of bullhead
catfishes.
One non-volumetric sample of fine-screened
material contained additional faunal elements of a
song bird and non-poisonous snake remains, both
non-food items (Table 2). The excavation units in
the area of presumed indigenous settlement contained the remains of at least three taxa not present

in Feature 3. These species are
armadillo, an unidentified species of medium-sized bird, and
gar fish. Although there is far
less faunal material from these
excavation units than from Feature 3, remains of Bovidae, deer,
several small-sized mammals,
and some snake and turtle remains, are present in these units.
These remains were not quantified and only species identifications were made.

The identified mammals are
opossum, rabbit, dog, whitetailed deer, cow/bison, and sheep/goat. The greatest number of identifiable fragments and MNI are
of cattle/bison (NISP=237; MNI=9). At least five
adults and four sub-adults (including remains of
juvenile individuals) are represented in the sample.
Non-domesticated animals that were hunted are the
opossum, rabbit, and deer. Several immature specimens may represent sheep/goat or deer; however,
these remains could not be distinguished. Remains
of one dog are also present at the Goliad mission.
The birds are represented by domestic species
of chicken, and possibly turkey. One femur from
unit S8EO contained medullary bone indicating
that at least one laying hen was present. Also
present is at least one duck, a black vulture, a
hawk, and a crow. With the exception of the duck,

these non-domestic birds probably do not represent food refuse.
Freshwater species include turtles and fish.
Two aquatic turtles are present. Remains of soft-

shelled turtles are more common
than those of the smaller-sized
mud/musk turtles. The remains of
at least three bony fishes are
present in the samples. Catfish is
the most common fish, while remains of gar fish and bass are represented by single elements. At
least one other unidentified species of sunfish is present in the
Goliad faunal assemblage.
The bulk soil samples from
three excavation units contained
several species not present in the
1/8-inch mesh samples (see Table
2); however, only the fish taxa
probably represent food refuse.
Mammals present in the bulk
samples include armadillo, unidentified small mammals, and a
small breed dog. No additional
bird taxa are present in the bulk
samples. Reptiles and amphibians
include snakes and frogs. The fish
taxa include the addition of smallsized minnows and buffalo fish.
Also represented are smaller-sized
individuals of catfish and sunfishes than were identified in the
118-inch samples. These data indicate that freshwater fishing was
somewhat more important than the
1/8-inch samples suggest and that
the fishing strategies employed by
the mission inhabitants included
the use of relatively fine-meshed
nets for at least some of the fishing activities.

Mission Rosario (41GD2)
The faunal material from
Rosario consists of 6494 vertebrate elements representing a
minimum of 80 individuals. The
quantity of faunal material is
greatest for Zone 1 (n=4581;
MNI=36). Zone 1 also contains the greatest diversity of taxa. At least nine mammals are present,
along with four species of birds, five reptiles, and
two species of bony fishes. Zone 2 contains 1537

elements representing 25 individuals. The identified taxa are three species of mammals, five species
of birds, three reptiles, and one species each of
cartilaginous and bony fish. The sample from Zone
3 is small (n=376, MNI=19)~ however, a distinct
pattern of faunal use is evident. The Zone 3 sample
consists of at least three mammals, four species of
birds, three reptiles, and one bony fish. Tables 4-6
indicate the identified taxa and measures of relative
abundance for the three midden zones.
The identified mammals that are of economic
importance from the three midden zones are the
burro, horse, pig, peccary, white-tailed deer, cow/
bison, and sheep/goat. Cattle/bison are the most
abundant remains in all three zones. Both sub-adults
and adults are present in the fauna! samples. Other
domestic mammals that were used for food are the
sheep/goat and domestic pig, but neither of these
are common. The caprines are represented by both
adult and sub-adult individuals. At least two individual Equus are present, both horse and burro. The
non-domestic mammals are the white-tailed deer
and the peccary. White-tailed deer is the second
most common mammal in both Zones 1 and 2. One
element of a peccary is present in Zone 1. Also
present is an unidentified species of rodent and a
skunk. Neither of these are considered to have been
food refuse.
The birds include mallard or duck, two species
of goose, swan, chicken, turkey, the greater prairie
chicken, and a plover. At least one laying hen is
present in the Zone 1 midden. Although domestic
fowl is represented by the remains of chicken and
possibly the turkey and domestic duck, the avian
fauna indicate that hunting for waterfowl added
some diversity to the diet. The presence of the
greater prairie chicken also indicates that hunting
took place in the tall grass prairie along the coast.
The small-sized plover probably does not represent
food refuse.
Reptiles in the faunal assemblage include
snakes, alligator, two species of aquatic turtles, and
gopher tortoise. Freshwater hunting is indicated by
the alligator, pond slider, and the soft-shelled turtle.
Remains of at least one gopher tortoise are present
in Zone 1.
The fishes are represented by one cartilaginous
fish and two species of bony fish. Interestingly, the
cartilaginous fish is a marine requiem shark represented by a single tooth. The bony fish are freshwater catfish and suckers.

The bulk samples from the three midden zones
include the remains of additional species not present
in the coarse fraction (see Table 2). The soil samples
from Rosario are similar to those from Espiritu
Santo in that only the previously unidentified fish
taxa probably represent food refuse. Fishes present
in the bulk samples include shad or herring and gar
fish. Also present are small rodents, unidentified
small birds, and snakes. Remains of smaller-sized
catfish are also present in the bulk samples. The
bulk samples indicate that the mission inhabitants
employed some capture techniques that allowed for
the collection of some small-sized fish individuals.

DISCUSSION
The faunal samples from the three missions
provide insights into the patterns of animal use by
two Native American populations in mission settings in South Texas. In addition to the specific
patterns that characterize the Texas coastal prairie,
these data can be compared to other areas of Spanish colonial mission settlement to identify the effects of ethnic and geographic variability on faunal
use within the Spanish empire.
One issue concerning the Native American
populations that were incorporated into mission life
on the Texas coastal plain is the degree to which
these populations adopted Spanish-introduced faunal resources as food items versus their reliance on
native fauna for their subsistence needs. Herds of
Spanish cattle were established along the coastal
plain in the early 18th century (Jackson 1986;
Ramsdell 1949; de la Teja 1995). By the 1730s,
significant herd growth had taken place from cattle
introduced by the Alarcon and Aguayo expeditions
of 1718 and 1721. Two rival centers of herd rearing
along the San Antonio River were the string of five
missions in San Antonio and the southern coastal
mission at the earlier location of Espiritu Santo, at
Goliad, and at the neighboring Rosario mission.
The tall grass prairies near Goliad and the oak savannas near San Antonio were particularly conducive to the growth of cattle herds. By the 1760s the
missions at Espiritu Santo at Goliad and Rosario
possessed greater than 20,000 branded head of cattle
(Jordan 1993). It is estimated that an equal or greater
number of unbranded cattle inhabited the area
(Ramsdell 1949:21). At Espiritu Santo cattle ranching was the primary economic activity, with little

tallow also contributed to the rapid demise of the
herds (Ramsdell 1949:23). By the late 1700s the
cattle herds were greatly diminished. At Mission
Rosario, abandonment of the mission in 1780
and later reoccupation in 1789 contributed to the
further decline in livestock. Fewer than a thousand cattle were controlled by the mission in the
early 1800s.
The early cattle ranches served as the foundation for Texas ranching in the 19th century. However, the proliferation of introduced livestock was
at the expense of indigenous fauna of the coastal
plain. Prior to the introduction of Spanish livestock, viable herds of bison inhabited the coastal
plain. Bison hunting was a significant dietary component of the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric

l

aboriginal populations (Ricklis 1992). The cattle
competed for rangeland with native herds of
American bison that were once very common on
the Texas plains. Anecdotal accounts suggest that
the Native American populations residing at the
missions preferred the taste of bison meat to cattle;
therefore, they would venture from the missions
to hunt for bison.
Archeological evidence supporting these claims
has yet to be provided. Due to the difficulty in
distinguishing bison from cattle using only skeletal
elements, archeological research must rely on size
characteristics of the bovids and the quantity of
non-bovid faunal remains to determine the degree
of hunting that took place away from the mission
setting. If off-site hunting was a common practice,

180

the faunal samples should indicate some use of
domestic introduced animals, particularly domestic
barnyard mammals and an abundance of hunted
native animals.
The faunal samples from the three sites indicate distinct differences in the use of wild resources
(Table 7). The samples from the two Espiritu Santo
missions contain primarily large mammal remains
of either cattle or bison. Although some deer were
hunted, smaller mammals of opossum and rabbit
were more common than other large indigenous
mammals. At the earlier Espiritu Santo location,
41VTl1, fox and black bear also were hunted. While
no domestic birds are present at 41 VTl 1, the avian
fauna from the Goliad mission location is dominated by chicken and turkey, with a minor use of
ducks. The crow, hawk, and turkey vulture present
at Goliad do not appear to have been hunted for
food. Aquatic turtles were used at both Espiritu
Santo locations. Only freshwater catfish are present
at 41 VTl 1, while a greater reliance on fishing is
indicated at Goliad. At least five species of freshwater fish (including additional species identified
in the bulk soil samples) indicate that some use of
aquatic resources took place, but that these were
not dietary staples. Close proximity to the San Antonio River would have allowed the inhabitants of
Espiritu Santo at Goliad access to some aquatic
resources without having to venture long distances
from the mission compound.
In contrast to the pattern of faunal use at the
two Espiritu Santo missions, the inhabitants of
Mission Rosario hunted a greater variety of mammals and birds. Although the sample is dominated
by large bovids, the remains of mammals, birds,
and reptiles all indicate that meat from hunted
animals constituted a larger component of the diet
at Rosario than at Espiritu Santo (see Table 7).
The Zone 3 sample is the least diverse of the three
time periods, particularly in terms of mammals.
However, the non-domestic birds include ducks
and greater prairie chicken. Remains of at least
two turkeys are present in the samples that may
also represent the use of wild species rather than
domesticates. The reptiles include alligator, none
of which are present at Espiritu Santo, and pond
sliders. A small number of fish remains are present
in the initial Rosario occupation.
The mammalian fauna from the Zones 1 and 2
midden deposits indicate that white-tailed deer were
relatively common in the samples. While not many

individuals are represented, deer are more common
than other barnyard domesticates of either caprines
(sheep or goats) or pigs. Also present is a single
element of a peccary. A greater diversity of birds
and reptiles characterize both Zones l and 2 than
was found at Espiritu Santo. Fishing provided some
animal protein, but was again not a significant activity by the mission inhabitants.
During the final occupation of Mission Rosario,
both horses and burros were present in the midden
faunal sample. Presumably, both animals were used
for transportation and as beasts of burden. Since
equids were highly valued, their use may have been
restricted to the friars. Because only three elements
are present in Zone 1, it is not possible to determine
if equid use increased through the occupation of the
mission or if the recovery of equid remains is exclusively a phenomenon of sampling. One burro is
indicated at 41VTl1. No equids are represented at
Espiritu Santo at Goliad.
The recent Rosario excavations contrast with
previous zooarcheological analyses that were conducted by Davidson (1974) and Butler (1974) following the excavations by Gilmore (1974). The
identified fauna from both of these earlier field
seasons are more diverse than the recent excavations. Mammals previously identified but not
present in this analysis include: armadillo, packrat,
mink, raccoon, black bear, beaver, jackrabbit, and
pronghorn antelope. At least three additional species of birds are present in the two previous studies;
however, with the exception of the roadrunner, the
birds may not represent food remains. Significantly,
the mammals present in the 1974 samples support
the evidence that meat obtained through hunting
was a significant component of the mission diet.
Although these data indicate that the diet was
supplemented with hunted meat, bovids were the
most common meat source. If the bovid remains
represent bison that were hunted some distance from
the mission compound, the representation of skeletal elements should reflect the fact that the preliminary butchering of bison occurred at the kill
site. Therefore, if off-site butchering occurred, the
samples should contain relatively few non-meaty
portions of the skeleton, such as the head and feet.
Table 8 presents the element distribution of bovid
remains from the three mission sites. The sample
from 41VT11 indicates that cranial elements are
most common. This high percentage is skewed by
the large number of molar fragments. At both Goliad

and Mission Rosario, axial elements (vertebrae and
ribs) are the most common. This characteristic is
not surprising considering the large number of
butchered portions that can be obtained along both
the vertebral column and the rib section. With the
exception of the Zone 3 midden at Rosario, cranial
and feet elements are the 2nd and 3rd most common portions of the skeleton. While both cranial
elements, particularly teeth, and feet elements are
durable and easy to identify, their high frequency is
greater than would be expected if off-site butchering had taken place. Therefore, the element representation is interpreted as indicating that on-site
butchering of cattle had taken place rather than offsite butchering and transport of bison.
Bone modifications also support on-site butchering (Table 9). The butchering methods employed
at all three missions consisted primarily of hacking
larger portions, particularly the axial ribs and vertebrae. Metal cuts are also common. No cuts could be
positively identified as stone tool marks. The deposits may have been buried relatively rapidly as
there is very little evidence of bone gnawing by
either carnivores or rodents.
Another characteristic of the fauna! assemblage
is the size of the bovid individuals. Dimensional
measurements were taken of all complete elements
from the three assemblages. The majority of the
elements are from mature individuals. In a few
instances measurements were taken of complete
elements from juveniles individuals. The measurements were compared to a large collection of
measurements collected from Spanish colonial sites
in Florida, Georgia, and the Caribbean, and from
British period and American sites along the Atlantic
coast of North America (Reitz and Ruff 1994).
Reitz and Ruff ( 1994) compiled data from a number
of time periods ranging from the 16th to the 19th
centuries and from sites located along a significant
latitudinal gradient. The dimensional measurements

41VT11

*

indicate that the cattle individuals represented in
Spanish colonial sites are generally larger than
individuals from either British or American sites.
Factors that contribute to this pattern are the origins
and post-medieval size of the cattle transported to
the colonies, local husbandry strategies, the
economic uses of animals, and local environmental
conditions (Reitz and Ruff 1994:707).
Although Reitz and Ruff (1994) were unable to
discern temporal trends in the size of cattle, some
of the largest cattle were from the 16th century site
of Puerto Real on Hispaniola. At Puerto Real, cattle
were allowed to free-range throughout the island
habitat. In the absence of other larger herbivores
and the presence of abundant grassland, there were
no obstacles to herd growth in the island setting.
Consequently, large herds of robust cattle proliferated and served as the foundation of a very profitable
economy. In addition to the production of tallow,
large numbers of hides were produced for sale, and
live animals were exported to other locations
throughout the Spanish empire.
In some regards, the 18th century mission setting of South Texas is very similar to that of Puerto
Real: cattle were introduced early in the settlement
of the area and allowed to free-range. Although
there was some initial competition with bison for
resources, historical accounts indicate that cattle
quickly out-competed the indigenous herbivores. If
this comparison is valid, dimensional measurements
of bovid remains from the South Texas missions
should fall within the larger or largest size range of
cattle previously identified from other Spanish colonial sites. If the bovid remains include both bison
and cattle, at least some of the measurement should
be greater than the previously identified dimensional ranges of the cattle.
Table 10 presents a comparison of dimensional
measurements of the most common bone elements
from the three South Texas missions, with

measurements from other Spanish sites and the site
of Puerto Real reported by Reitz and Ruff (1994).
The most commonly well-preserved elements are
distal limb elements, particularly the astragalus and
other tarsals and metapodials. Comparisons of Texas
mission bovid measurements with those presented
by Reitz and Ruff (1994:703-704) indicate that the
mission bovid measurements fall within the size
range of Spanish cattle from both the Caribbean
and Spanish Florida. The elements are smaller than
the dimensional measurements of the Puerto Real
cattle with the exception of two elements. One is a
metacarpus (lower forelimb) from Zone 1 at Mission
Rosario. The distal breadth (71.1 mm) of the Rosario
element was larger than those reported for either
Puerto Real (range 58.0-64.6 mm, n=3) or other
Spanish sites (range 57 .0-60.6 mm, n=2). The
Rosario specimen may represent either a large-sized
cattle specimen or possibly a bison individual. Also,
one distal metacarpus from 41VT11 exceeds the
Puerto Real data (74.4 mm). 1
These results support the argument that the majority of mission bovids are the remains of cattle
rather than bison. Two larger-sized bovids, one
present in the terminal occupation of Mission

Rosario and one from 41VT11, may be bison. Alternatively, these specimens may represent a different breed of cattle than was present in the Caribbean
or at other Spanish sites. The measurements also
indicate that individual animals were relatively
large; therefore, there were many adults in the assemblage that presumably were healthy. There is a
subjective impression among mission researchers
who are interested in the faunal remains that the
mission refuse often contains the remains of both
smaller and larger-sized bovids. Additional dimensional measurements of both cattle and bison elements from other historic and prehistoric sites in
Texas would provide further comparative data on
this issue. Without more specific information on
the origins of the breeds introduced to Texas, however, it is not possible to make more specific generalizations from the morphometric data.
A final issue concerns the probable economic
uses of the bovids in the mission setting. The historical accounts indicate that during the height of
cattle abundance, many animals were killed for their
tallow and that large numbers of cattle were exported to other regions. The relatively short-lived
cattle economic boom was followed by a period of

cattle scarcity during the late 1780s and 1790s.
During the economic boom period many cattle were
used for tallow. Tallow production often involves
the boiling and splitting of long bones to facilitate
the extraction of fat. Long bone splintering can also
result from depositional conditions and from excavation technique.
All three assemblages contain large numbers
of split shaft fragments. At Mission Rosario, Zone
1 contains a greater percentage of split elements
than either Zones 2 or 3. Both locations of Espiritu
Santo contained numerous shaft fragments. In addition to animal processing during the mission occupations, soil conditions at each site may have
contributed to the high frequency of split long bones.
At Mission Rosario, Zone 1 is a highly compact silt
and fine-grained sand lens that quickly hardened
once exposed. The excavation of this zone with
trowels may have contributed to bone breakage.
Feature 3 at the Espiritu Santo mission on the
Guadalupe River was also a shallow, near surface
deposit that hardened very quickly once exposed.
At Espiritu Santo at Goliad, the excavations were
in heavily wooded areas with a large quantity of
roots. The soil throughout the stratigraphic deposit
was extremely humid, and some bone breakage may
be attributed to these soil conditions. Recent breaks
and root etching were not quantified during the analysis, but both were very common. In order to reliably
determine if bone breakage resulted from animal
processing or if it was a taphonomic phenomenon,
a more detailed analysis of the shaft fragments
would need to be undertaken. Potential evidence in
support of animal processing would include pot polish from boiling and patterned breakage patterns.

CONCLUSIONS
Excavation of three 18th century missions on
the South Texas coastal prairie produced an abundance of faunal remains. These remains are associated with two different Native American populations
that were undergoing missionization by Franciscan
missionaries. The Aranama and Tamique Indians
inhabited the Espiritu Santo de Zuniga mission
along the Guadalupe River and then at its later
location in Goliad, Texas, while a population of
Karankawa Indians resided at Mission Rosario. One
means of control in the mission setting was to alter
traditional subsistence activities, particularly hunting practices. This strategy had the two-fold objective of keeping the Indians on the mission compound
to increase the chances of religious conversion while
at the same time it provided the Franciscan missionaries with a labor pool for the economic activities on the missions.
A zooarcheological analysis of samples from
the three missions indicate that large bovids
dominate the faunal remains at all three sites and in
all time periods. The element representationincluding large numbers of cranial and foot partsstrongly suggests that the bovids are cattle rather
than bison. Dimensional measurements of bovid
remains are almost exclusively within the size range
of cattle from Spanish colonial sites in Florida and
the Caribbean. Cattle ranching was the economic
mainstay of both missions. The quantity of shaft
fragments at the sites may indicate carcass
processing for tallow; however, additional quantitative data are needed to eliminate the alternative
explanation that site taphonomic conditions were

de France - Zooarcheological Evidence of Colonial Culture Change
responsible for the high frequencies of splintered
shaft fragments.
The Indian populations at the missions rapidly
adopted the use of metal tools for animal butchering as evidenced by the abundance of both metal
hacks and cut marks. Other bone modifications are
relatively rare.
One of the strongest differences among the three
mission assemblages is the dietary contribution of
hunted meat. At Espiritu Santo, hunting was focused on smaller mammals, with some use of whitetailed deer. A small number of birds, reptiles, and
fish augmented the diet. In contrast to the pattern
indicated at both locations of Espiritu Santo, the
Karankawa population residing at Mission Rosario
subsisted on a greater quantity and variety of wild
animals that were obtained through off-site hunting. Mammals, birds, and reptiles are more diverse
and of greater dietary importance at Rosario. This
hunting strategy included the capture and transport
of some marine coastal resources in addition to
freshwater aquatic animals. The greater use of
hunted meat by the Karankawa population supports
historical accounts that suggest the Karankawa were
more resistant to control by the missionaries than
the populations residing at Espiritu Santo.
These data and the excavation of other Spanish
colonial settlements (e.g., the Refugio mission and
additional research at the Guadalupe River location
[41VT11, see Walter, this volume]) of Espiritu
Santo are expanding our knowledge of the types of
culture change the indigenous populations of South
Texas underwent as a result of missionization by
the Spaniards. The explosion of the cattle ranching
economy and subsequent alteration of traditional
subsistence practices during the 18th century was
one avenue of culture change for the Native populations. This study indicates that comparative, detailed studies of zooarcheological remains from the
mission contexts provide empirical data on the process of subsistence and economic change.

Early and Protohistoric Agents of Vegetation Change
in the Environs of Mission Rosario (41GD2)
as Reflected in Palynological Data
Bruce M. Albert

ABSTRACT
An 18th century pollen spectrum was recovered from a cupric oxide-enriched soil from the excavations at
Mission Rosario (41 GD2), dating to ca. 1760-1780. This pollen sample was compared to a modem pollen analog
sample from the site's surface to ascertain the degree of vegetation change experienced in the environs of the
mission since the 18th century. Support for a hypothesis of protohistoric fire-setting by indigenous peoples is
offered in the interpretation of the pollen spectra.

SAMPLING ISSUES AND
LABORATORY METHODOLOGY
In general, most archeological soils yield only
poorly preserved pollen grains unless special conditions for their preservation are effective (cf. Bryant
and Holloway 1983; Dimbleby 1985). Factors promoting pollen preservation-such as soil acidity
and anaerobicity-are effective in that they reduce
the degree of microbial (including fungal) activity
that normally acts to consume pollen grains.
The preservative effects of cupric oxides in
particular on pollen grains were first suspected by
the author during a 1991 examination of Bronze
Age (2nd Millennium B.C.) artifacts in the collection of the Archaeological Institute in Plzen,
then Czechoslovakia. Bronze swords and axes
recovered from burial mounds had preserved such
organic materials as wooden scabbards and
leather tongs more than 3000 years old. The toxic
qualities of the cupric oxide compounds produced
in the soil by virtue of contact with bronze artifacts appear to have deterred microbial activity,
thus preserving the ancient organic artifacts.
Given the degradation-resistant quality of the
sporopollenin in pollen grains vis a vis other organic material (cf. Feagri et al. 1989), it was
decided to take samples for pollen analysis from
further excavations yielding bronze artifacts in
the former Czechoslovakia.

Successful attempts to recover prehistoric
pollen spectra were then made in 1993 and 1994
from grave contexts at the Early Bronze Age Nitra
Culture site of Mytna Nova Ves in West Slovakia,
and the Early Iron Age Horakov Culture site of
Vojkovice in South Moravia. The spectra produced
were inconsistent with their modem vegetation
setting, and correlated well with palynological
findings from both lacustrine and alluvial pollen
sites in the region.
A further opportunity to take pollen samples
was realized during excavations of the Rosario Mission (41GD2) by Goliad in South Texas (see Ricklis,
this volume), where a large copper kettle fragment
(ca. 10 cm 2 in size) was found in situ in Zone 2,
well-dated deposits (ca. 1760-1780) belonging to
the early occupation of the mission. A soil sample
of ca. 1 cm3 was recovered from an organic-rich
soil underlying the copper kettle fragment. Additional soil was recovered from Zones 1-3, as well
as the modem soil surface south of the mission
enclosure. It was hoped that the Zone 1-3 soils
would provide a comparative basis for the degree
of pollen degradation in the soil recovered from the
copper artifact.
These soils were reduced by mechanical
methods at the Geo-Archaeology Laboratory and
then by chemical methods at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, both at The University of Texas at Austin. For purposes of mechanical

reduction, samples were first defflocated in a 5
percent solution of sodium hexa-metaphosphate in
distilled water and filtered through a 177 micron
screen (removing particles larger than 177 microns),
followed by mechanically-aided filtration through
an 8 micron screen (removing particles smaller
the 8 microns). Samples thus reduced were then
chemically reduced by the application of KOH (to
remove gross organics) and then HCL (to remove
carbonates). Silicates were further reduced by the
application of HF and HCL to remove silico-fluorides. Samples were next subjected to acetolysis
(i.e., boiled in a 10 percent solution of sulfuric
acid and 90 percent acetic anhydride to remove
cellulose), cleaned in distilled water and ethanol,
stained in a solution of safranine and tertiary butyl
alcohol, and finally mounted in a substrate of 2000
viscosity silicone oil for purposes of light microscopic analyses.

RESULTS OF THE POLLEN
ANALYSES
The general soils from Zones 1-3 contained no
recognizable pollen, presumably having been
largely degraded by microbial activity. The modern
soil contained abundant pollen, producing a spectrum of 15 types. The soil from under the copper
kettle fragment also contained abundant pollen, with
14 types (Table 1). Pollen concentrations from the
Zone 2 soil at Rosario are also 20 percent greater
than that from the modern surface.
Regarding the over-representation of "degradation-resistant" pine and composite pollen, pine

is more common in the modern analog sample
than in the Zone 2 soil. Conversely, composites
of the tubuliflora type appear to be more common in the Zone 2 soil, although unlike pine,
these pollen grains are "degradation resistant"
because of their thick exines and gross, "spiny"
morphology that renders them recognizable, even
in a partially degraded state. Twenty to 30 percent of the composite grains are superficially degraded (a "spike" of degraded pollen from soil
particles more distal to the copper artifact?). The
latter pollen grains should be excluded from what
otherwise appears to be an essentially intact pollen spectrum.

MODERN AFFORESTATION
Given the widespread pollination patterns
exhibited by species of oak (Quercus sp.) and
hackberry (Celtis sp.), the order of magnitude
increase in pollen types of the tree, shrub, and scrub
groups in the modern sample must reflect a regional
pattern of afforestation and scrub invasion in the
Goliad area in the centuries following the
establishment of the presidio and mission system
by La Bahfa (after 1721 ). The growth of the modern
oak mottes that dot the present-day landscape of
the Goliad area might then be a relatively modern
phenomenon, as is the "scrub invasion" of
leguminous species such as mesquite. Due to the
relative dearth of clay soils atop the sand-and-siltrich Goliad formation, the increase in scrub seems
to be primarily hackberry and acacia, as the
mesquite tends to thrive better on clays.
This tendency towards the growth of woody
vegetation is also expressed across a range of species inhabiting the outer margins of the riparian
woodland of the San Antonio River: Carya (pecan
or hickory, perhaps water hickory), Juglans (black
walnut), and Myrica. Conversely, the inner margins of the riparian woodland as expressed by
finds of Salix (willow) pollen are no longer found
in the modern soil. Presumably, this reflects the
exclusion of riverside airborne willow pollen by
the leafy canopy space of the now more exuberant
riparian woodland elements that have waxed since
the colonial era. Finds of Salix in early historic
times may imply that the outer margins of the riparian zone had been less densely wooded between
1760-1780.

PRAIRIE VEGETATION
IN EARLY HISTORIC
(ZONE2)AND
MODERN TIMES
After the ca. 20-30 percent
semi-degraded composite pollen
"spike" in the Zone 2 sample is
accounted for, the relative composition of the herbal component in the Zone 2 and modem
pollen sums is remarkably similar, with the frequency of composite pollen, grasses, and
sedges occurring in similar proportions (see Table 1). Artemisia and cheno-ams comprise
only a very minor part of the
open landscape vegetation as
reflected in both the early historic Zone 2 and modern pollen sums.
More emphatic in the two
pollen sums is the decline in the
relative proportion of herbal pollen since ca. 1760-1780. The
growth of oak mottes, scrub vegetation (cf. Bogusch 1952), and
riparian woodland has certainly
led to the contraction of the prairie in modem times as reflected
in pollen data.

generally open character of the landscape, but also
in the reduced state of the riparian woodland around
the margins of the San Antonio River.
It is important to emphasize that these observations are from the period prior to significant
impact by the Spanish on the local environment,
dating as they do to the establishment phase of
Mission Rosario; later documents also suggest that
pressure on the local environment increased with
the growth of La Bahia. Population estimates for
the colonial La Bahia settlement range as high as
1400 individuals (including mission indians?) by
1806 (O'Conner 1966:95). A ca. 1826 drawing of
the La Bahia settlement made by Leno Sanchez y
Tapia (Berlandier 1980) is suggestive of a landscape largely denuded of trees, even during this
period of population decline in the second and
third decades of the 19th century. It is likely that
the need for building material as well as the large
Spanish mission cattle herds also had some impact on the development of the pre-1830 landscape near Goliad.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF SPANISH
COLONIAL AGRICULTURE
Because the dry farming of maize by the inhabitants of La Bahia was always an uncertain enterprise during the 18th century (the San Antonio
River cuts too deeply to allow for ready irrigation), its cultivation comprised only a secondary
aspect to the ranching economy. However, it is
possible that the singular pollen grain of the Zea
(maize) type recovered from the Zone 2 deposit at
Rosario derives from such arable tracts of maize.
Otherwise, it may derive from stocks of imported
grain obtained from Bexar, a regular supplier of
supplementary corn to La Bahia (see de la Teja
1995:90).
Ranching was by far a more important
economic activity during the late 18th century, when
largely unbranded, free-wandering herds of more
than 30,000 head of cattle are periodically recorded
as grazing in the Mission Rosario environs (de la
Teja 1995:97). Such large herds would surely have
had an important impact on the local vegetation,
particularly in the evidence for "brush invasion"
and denudation of grasslands observed in the
modem pollen spectrum. It should also be noted
that more open prairie landscapes are also recorded

by much later "Anglo-Texan" farmers in parts of
South Texas never settled by the Spanish in colonial
times. In fact, the recorded large scale "brush invasion" of mesquite and other species (leguminosae,
Acacia, and Celtis) did not begin in earnest until
the latter part of the 19th century (Powell 1994:76).
In other respects, expectations of environmental impacts made by cattle herds contradict some of
the palynological observations made by the author,
notably the modem expansion of the riparian woodland and oak mottes. Experimental data from Southwestern common lands suggest that overgrazing
acts to reduce tree cover, even in well-watered riparian areas, through the suppression of sapling
growth with excessive soil compaction and exposure (Gillis 1991:668-675). Similarly, factors such
as climate change cannot concurrently explain both
the "scrub invasion" (a xeric phenomenon) and the
"riparian expansion" (a mesic phenomenon; see
Holecek [1991:115-120] for a further discussion of
this climatic aspect of the problem of "scrub invasion" with respect to Chihuahuan Desert elements).
One hypothesis that can account for all observed
phenomena (grassland contraction, scrub invasion,
and riparian expansion) is fire suppression.

AGENTS OF FIRE-SETTING
ON RANGELAND
Fire serves to recycle nutrients quickly through
the topsoil while suppressing brush and favoring
grasses and other herbal perennials that are nutritious to cattle and other bovids (including bison).
Scrub vegetation is never permanently suppressed;
however, such vegetation requires a longer period
to recover from fire (see Bock and Bock 1992:4953). For example, stands of mimosa (a relative of
acacia) take two or more years to renew growth as
reflected in recent experiments at the AppletonWhittle Research Ranch. Presumably then, cycles
of fire-setting repeated on the same patch of rangeland every three (or more) years will serve to exclude scrub as a significant vegetation element. The
exposed margins of the riparian woodland may also
be inadvertently affected during such fire setting,
performed presumably to improve grazing conditions for bovid herds.
When and by whom would such fire setting,
and its subsequent suppression, have taken place?
The limited, but corroborative, historical and

Albert - Early and Protohistoric Agents of Vegetation Change of Mission Rosario

palynological data suggest that the Spanish entered
into what was already an open environment, quite
unlike the climax oak mottes and riparian woodland
that would develop atop the sandy soils of the
Goliad Formation in the absence of human
intervention. In temporal terms alone, the agents
of the hypothetical range fires must have been the
prehistoric and protohistoric Native Americans of
the Goliad region. This hypothesis of Native
agency may be explained in ecological terms
because of the economic character of the Late
Prehistoric Toyah phase, an archeological "technocomplex" that seems to be importantly (but not
entirely) based upon bison hunting (cf. Ricklis
1994). Those Native groups relying to a greater
extent on bison hunting could then have adapted
their environment to the benefit of the bison herds
by means of cyclical fire-setting of the rangeland.
There is corroborative ethnohistoric evidence for
such practices by indigenous populations.

ETHNOHISTORIC EVIDENCE FOR
FIRE SETTING BY INDIGENOUS
POPULATIONS
As early as the 1520s, Cabeza de Vaca first
observed the Natives of an unspecified region of
Texas (presumably in the southern or southeastern
portion of the state) as "going about in a firebrand, setting fire to the plains" (Humphrey
1958:235), although de Vaca's account as to why
these indigenous inhabitants acted in this way is
vague at best. Of greater significance are
observations of Mi net ( 1987) in his account of the
La Salle expedition in 1687. Entries dated to
February 15th and 16th (Minet 1987: 104-106) refer
to a landward trek of some five leagues into the
interior near the north end of Matagorda Island.
On the 15th, Minet notes that "we found the
country flooded with lakes" (salt marshes?), and
after having traveled inland some three leagues,
he again records that he "saw smoke from afar"
(fire setting?), and "a quantity of killed bison
carcasses, killed at least 8-9 months previously"
(products of a late spring or early summer bison
hunt?). On the second landward day, Minet noted
during the two league trek that "fire had burned
over all these places." Minet and company then
made their way back to the ship, putting an end to
further observations, but the potential implications

193

of Minet' s final statement are considerable
regarding the modification of the coastal plain
environment by its indigenous inhabitants. The
areal extent of the fires observed by Minet may
have been on the order of several km 2, as
significant patches of the landscape were impacted
by "Native fire-branding." Finds of bison carcasses
killed in the previous year's hunt reinforces the
impression that this measure was made to aid the
bison herds on which these peoples' subsistence
depended upon to an important degree.
Other reasons for fire setting by the indigenous
populations of South Texas include setting fires to
help stampede deer in hunting drives (cf. Campbell
and Campbell 1981 ). It is interesting that one of the
few Native tribal names that has been reconstructed
by Campbell and Campbell (1981) comes from the
Great Bend of the Nueces River south of the study
area, from the Pastia Indians. It appears that the
term "Pastia" derives from Spanish translations of
Coahuiltecan terms for "to bum," "scorched," and
"seared" (Campbell and Campbell 1981:53). This
is a suggestive coincidence in light of ethnohistorical
observations of Native fire setting in other regions
of Texas.

CONCLUSIONS AND HYPOTHESES
Limited palynological data, supported by historic and ethnohistoric accounts, suggest that the
environment encountered by the Spanish at the
establishment of Mission Rosario in the 18th century was one already modified at the hands of the
prehistoric and protohistoric indigenous populations of the Goliad area. It is probable that this
environment was modified by means of deliberate
fire setting. The resurgence of the modem oak and
riparian woodlands into modern times has occurred
in spite of considerable grazing pressures on the
land during the last 250 years. It is likely that
these developments occurred more intensively after the widespread replacement of indigenous Native American populations in the 19th century,
although the frequency of fire setting may have
lessened as early as the mid-18th century as local
Native groups were absorbed into the Spanish mission system.
It is fortunate that these speculations derive
from observations of sites atop the sandy soils of
the Goliad formation, in the environs of the riparian

woodland of the San Antonio River that support
climax communities of oak and other deciduous
hardwoods under natural conditions. This has allowed the historical contraction of the South Texas
grassland to be viewed along several lines beyond
that of "scrub invasion" alone. The additional recovery of the oak mottes and riparian woodland in
the modern period would have been more difficult
to detect at sites in the mesquite-infested clay flats
lying to the south and east of the Goliad Formation.
Furthermore, it is fortunate that Captain Paszina' s
observations shed light on the very earliest environment encountered by the Spanish, an environment that was already modified from its natural
state in 1754. This impression of an open grassland
is given quantitative support in 1760-1780 pollen
data from Zone 2 at Mission Rosario.
Should these hypotheses be verified by further
work on the vegetation history of South Texas,
implications for understanding the cultural ecology
of the indigenous Native American populations are
considerable, particularly the active role such populations took to form their environment to suit their
needs. Further insight may be made into possible
adaptations of modern range-management and the
possible long-term ecological effects of fire setting
on rangeland.

Assessing Native American Mobility versus Permanency
at Mission San Juan de Capistrano through
the Use of Stable Isotope Analysis
Diane A. Cargill and Robert J. Hard

ABSTRACT
Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses were conducted on 19 individuals and six faunal species from
Mission San Juan de Capistrano in San Antonio, Texas. The carbon and nitrogen values are most similar to
prehistoric Texas coastal hunters and gatherers and least similar to South Texas inland hunters and gatherers.
While the observed carbon isotopic values may reflect maize consumption, the nitrogen values are more positive
than those typical of maize-dependent populations, and more closely resemble those found in populations
consuming freshwater or near-shore marine resources. This suggests thatmission residents may have had premission locations near the coast and that their isotopic signatures remained unaffected by a mission diet,
indicating that Native residency was intermittent or of short duration.

INTRODUCTION
Colonial mission research currently includes
two main perceptions regarding Native American
sedentism at Spanish missions in Texas. The first
view is that numerous small hunting and gathering
groups settled permanently at the missions because
these institutions provided a secure subsistence and
a safe haven from enemy raiders (John 1991). Implicit in this perception is the idea that the Native
Americans who entered the missions became acculturated and eventually integrated into the larger
Spanish community (Habig 1968). This view is
currently popularized in the movie "Gente de
Razon" or People of Reason, shown daily at the
Mission San Jose Visitor's Center. The second perception is that the length of Native residency at
Spanish missions was limited due to multiple factors. These include an unwillingness of neophytes
to enter and remain at missions (Hinojosa 1991);
high infant and maternal mortality and death from
European diseases (Schuetz 1980a); and the Native
use of missions on an intermittent basis coincident
with seasonal food procurement strategies (Ricklis
1996). There is evidence supporting both perceptions in the ethnohistorical literature of the San
Antonio missions (Hinojosa 1991; Schuetz 1980a).
These two alternatives are not mutually exclusive;

however, there were at least a few individuals who
were permanent mission residents (Schuetz l 980a).
Rather, the question is whether permanent residency
was the dominant pattern for the numerous small
hunting and gathering groups who entered Spanish
missions in South Texas.
We have pursued a preliminary assessment of
this issue through stable isotope analysis on 19
human individuals and six faunal species from Mission San Juan de Capistrano, and two prehistoric
human individuals from Bexar County, Texas.
Stable isotope studies allow for dietary reconstruction. The ethnohistorical and archeological evidence
indicates a mission resident diet comprised largely
of maize and beef. If the majority of Native people
entered and remained at the mission and consumed
a diet dominated by maize and beef, their bone
collagen would express a particular carbon and nitrogen isotope signal. On the other hand, a nonmission diet may be inferred by alternative isotope
values, which would then imply a limited use of the
mission by hunting and gathering groups.

along the San Antonio' River (Figure 1). San Antonio
de Valero, better known as the Alamo, opened its
doors in 1718, and it was soon followed by the
founding of Mission San Jose y San Miguel de
Aguayo in 1720. Mission Valero' s promoter was
Fray Antonio Olivares, who had first seen the San
Antonio area in 1709. He felt the area was an ideal
location for supplying the material needs of a
mission, as well as serving as a half-way station
between the Spanish settlements to the west and the
presidios and missions in East Texas (Bannon 1979;
see Carlson and Corbin, this volume). The
settlement of San Antonio was important, therefore,
in securing the entire frontier province of Texas. In
1731, 13 years after the establishment of San
Antonio de Valero, three missions were moved from
East Texas. These were Nuestra Senora de la
Purisima Concepcion de Acuna, San Juan de
Capistrano, and San Francisco de la Espada, creating

a chain of five missions on the San Antonio River
(Habig 1968).
Native groups who entered the San Antonio
missions came from areas in Texas, Northeastern
Mexico, and the Southern High Plains. The latter
was home to the Apache, a few of whom entered
Mission San Antonio de Valero (Schuetz 1980a).
Due to incomplete records, the entirety of groups
who entered these missions will probably never be
known; however, it appears that indigenous people
came from areas south of San Antonio, northeastern Mexico, and along the Rio Grande from its
delta as far upstream as Laredo (Campbell and
Campbell 1985).
Groups known to have been present at Mission
San Juan have been compiled from mission registers and a variety of other sources (Campbell and
Campbell 1985; Schuetz 1980a). In 1777, Father
Morfi wrote that Mission San Juan de Capistrano
was founded for the Orejones, Sayopines,
Pamaques, and Piquiques (Schuetz 1968). The early
18th century mission foundation document states,
however, that Mission San Juan was founded for
the Tilijae (Tiloujaa) and the Venado groups
(Campbell and Campbell 1985). Approximate premission locations and mission entrance dates for
known Native groups at Mission San Juan (Figure
2) are taken from Campbell and Campbell (1985),
Salinas (1990), and Schuetz (1980a).
Prior to missionization, Native Americans in
South Texas and northeastern Mexico practiced either an inland hunting and gathering subsistence
strategy focused on the prairies and riparian zones,
or a coastal adaptation focused primarily on the
resources of the bays, estuaries, and barrier islands
(Hester 1981). According to historical documents,
once these hunters and gatherers became active participants in mission life, their diet was comprised
largely of domesticated plants and animals, specifically maize and cattle (Leutenegger 1976;
Leutenegger and Habig 1978; Schuetz 1968, 1980a).
Maize and beef were significant dietary items in
both attracting Native groups to the missions
(Hinojosa 1991) and in providing the major components of the mission diet. Analyses of archeological faunal remains from neighboring Mission
San Jose and Mission Valero demonstrate that cattle
bone comprised a high percentage of the overall
faunal assemblage (Hard et al. 1995; Meissner 1998;
Tomka and Fox 1998). Furthermore, numerous references to maize and domesticated animals, as they

and house construction (Hinojosa

individuals were apostates from
missions on the Rio Grande. Others, probably in need of protection
from warring groups, were also
anxious to enter Spanish missions
(Hinojosa 1991). The following
passage written by a Texas missionary in 1740 demonstrates the
frustration of missionizing Native
groups, but alludes to the successful transition to mission life:

pertain to both consumption and inventories, are
found in historical documents of the San Antonio
missions. For example, in 1762, Padre Dolores made
an inspection of Mission San Juan and reported
" .. .in the granary, that is a spacious room, they
store about 1,000 fanegas of maize and beans necessary for the sustenance of the Indians, for which
purpose they also keep one thousand head of large
cattle, and 3500 small livestock" (Schuetz 1968:46).

PERMANENT OCCUPATION
OF THE MISSIONS
The Spanish Crown and Religious Fathers
viewed the mission as an institution for the permanent reduccion of Native peoples, and they tried to
control the mobility of their residents. Apostates
who fled the mission were often returned with the
aid of presidial soldiers, thereby insuring that they
remained under the supervision of the Padre (Habig
1968; Hinojosa 1991).
Permanent occupation of the missions by some
Native groups is inferred from references to the requests and needs of indigenous people, to missionary reports, and to demographic analysis of mission
populations. Apparently, some groups were ready to
settle and requested missions be established for them.
The Fathers found that these individuals were often
familiar with many Hispanic skills such as planting

199

The conversions are not difficult but are burdensome as it
is necessary to work with them
in the manner of a mother giving birth to an infant. It might
take five, six, or seven years
to bring them to be rational
creatures, and it is a rarity to
find one who didn't flee two
or three times to the wilderness (Schuetz 1980a:233).

At Mission Valero, where almost complete
mission registers exist, it is known that some
individuals permanently resided there as they have
been traced through birth, baptismal, marriage, and
death registers (Schuetz 1980a). Although infant
mortality was high at Valero (67 percent of 319
individuals who are recorded in both birth and death
registers died before the age of three), there were
14 individuals who attained an age between 20-29
years, and eight who lived to between 30-45 years
of age (Schuetz 1980a). This suggests that while
life expectancy was low if born at the mission,
there were individuals who remained there from
birth through adulthood.

INTERMITTENT, OR SHORT-TERM
OCCUPATION OF THE MISSIONS
While it is known that some Native American
groups requested the establishment of a mission
and appeared to be ready to adopt mission life or
simply needed the protection the mission provided,
others may have initially "entered" because of the
availability of food without understanding in full
the obligations inherent in mission life. Hinojosa

(1991) states, however, that most groups did not

Historical documents contain numerous references to Spanish recruiting efforts and Native desertions at Texas missions (Leutenegger 1976;

Salinas 1990; Schuetz 1968, 1980a). The continuous recruitment of neophytes by the Spanish FaMaterials

never completed, dates from approximately 17631785 (Schuetz 1968). Recent osteological analysis
conducted by Doug Owsley ( 1998 personal
communication) from the Smithsonian Institution
and a team of physical anthropologists demonstrates that the human skeletal assemblage is
largely Native American, with perhaps a small
number of individuals of Native American and
European admixture. We used two criteria to select
the human samples for stable isotope analysis.
The first was that the individuals chosen be
positively identified as male or female. This was
done in order to evaluate potential dietary
differences between the sexes. Based on Miller's
(1989) analysis, 10 females and 9 males were
selected. The second criteria was to include burials
that represented only one individual. Comingled
burials were not selected in order to avoid the
possibility of analyzing multiple elements from
the same individual. Human rib bones were chosen
for analysis in 15 of the 19 samples; due to the
lack of rib bones in four individuals, miscellaneous
bone was used. We selected the faunal sample
from Mission San Juan rooms containing unmixed
colonial deposits. A variety of elements (e.g.,
turtle carapace and cow femur) were chosen from
these collections.
For comparative purposes, we also conducted
stable isotope analysis on two individuals from
Bexar County. One individual from 41BX952 is
dated by the association of an Edwards arrow point.
The Edwards point dates from ca. A.D. 900-1040
(Turner and Hester 1993), and while not embedded
in the bone, it was in direct association with the
vertebrae (Meissner, 1999 personal communication). The other individual from 41BX677 produced
an accelerator radiocarbon date of A.D. 1420-1650
(2 sigma, calibrated) from bone collagen (Tennis
1994). We selected miscellaneous bone from these
two individuals for analysis. Harold Krueger from
Geochron Laboratories (Cambridge, Massachusetts)
performed the stable isotope analysis; Krueger and
Sullivan (1984) and Cargill (1996) describe the analytical procedures.

Stable Isotope Analysis
Since their introduction 20 years ago, stable
carbon and nitrogen isotope studies have become
widely accepted analytical techniques for

201

reconstructing some major dietary components such
as the use of maize, aquatic, and terrestrial resources
(e.g., Hutchinson et al. 1998; Pate 1994;
Schoeninger and Moore 1992; Schwarcz and
Schoeninger 1991; Vogel and van der Merwe 1977).
Stable 13 C and 15N in human bone collagen are
measured with a mass spectrometer. The abundance
of a stable isotope in a sample is measured as a
ratio of the heavier to the lighter isotope, with
reference to the ratio of a standard reference
material (Ambrose 1993:65). The reference
standards are: 13 C/ 12C of Pee Dee Belemnite
(PDB) and 15 N/ 14 N of atmospheric nitrogen
known as the Ambient Inhalable Reservoir (AIR).
Isotope ratios are expressed with the delta symbol
(8) in parts per thousand (%0 or per mil), using
the following formula:
8(%0) =[(Ratio of sample/Ratio standard)-1) X 1000

Typically the resulting 8 13 C%o values are negative
and the 8 15N%o values are positive.
As these isotopes are introduced, metabolized,
and incorporated into the cells of organisms and
passed up through the food chain, the changes that
occur in the isotope ratios are known as "fractionation." Because the degree of fractionation is predictable and largely known, an organism's isotopic
values can indicate its dietary history. For archeological contexts bone collagen is the most frequently
available tissue. When carbon is incorporated into
bone collagen, there is a positive fractionation or
enrichment of 3-5%0 between diet and collagen,
and 5%o is usually assumed for analytical purposes
(Bender et al. 1981; DeNiro and Epstein 1978;
Schwarcz and Schoeninger 1991; Vogel 1978). For
example, an herbivore with a pure C 3 diet (-27. l %0)
would have a bone collagen level of around -22.1 %0
(Hard et al. 1996:265).
Since omnivores, including humans, consume
plants and animals, the carbon chains utilized for
collagen synthesis may not be produced in direct
proportion to the occurrence of carbon molecules
in the bulk diet. Although this has been the standard model (e.g., van der Merwe 1982; Spielmann
et al. 1990), it now appears that the carbon molecules are not derived from the bulk diet, but may
be derived largely from protein, rather than fats or
carbohydrates (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Krueger
and Sullivan 1984; Tieszen and Fagre 1993a,

202

Texas Archeological Society

l 993b). Glycine is abundant in maize and makes up
33 percent of collagen's amino acids. If it provided
the carbon molecules for collagen, it would account for the high carbon isotopic values seen in
the human collagen of maize agriculturalists
(Tieszen and Fagre 1993b:37). Although this research is in its early stages, it is now clear that
collagen isotopic levels cannot be directly translated into the bulk dietary proportions of C3 versus
C 4 sources, although major dietary trends have been
successfully detected. There is some indication that
the isotopic values of bone apatite, rather than collagen, more precisely reflect bulk dietary proportions (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Tieszen and Fagre
1993a). While this is a promising alternative, insufficient comparative data are available to consider
this approach here, although we also report the
bone apatite values from the San Juan Capistrano
population. In contrast to carbon, nitrogen is only
found in proteins.
Our approach is to use bivariate plots of collagen o13 C and o15N values compared with the collagen isotopic values of other archeological
populations whose isotopic signatures and diet are
understood. In addition, we consider the known
isotopic levels of potential dietary components in
order to make inferences regarding the dietary history of the San Juan Capistrano population.
The isotopic collagen signature should reflect
the diet over the period of time in which bone
collagen is fully replaced. Since the bone collagen
turnover rate is l 0 to 30 years, the stable isotope
values should reflect an average of the dietary intake during this period (Stenhouse and Baxter
1979:339; Bumstead 1985:544; Krueger and
Sullivan 1984:210). Thus, the isotopic signature of
an individual who spent most of his life in one
region, but lived at the mission for only a few years
before expiring, will reflect his former rather than
his later diet.

Terrestrial Carbon
Plants incorporate carbon from the atmosphere
using one of three photosynthetic pathways, two of
which result in distinct carbon stable isotope ratios
( 13 C/ 12C) (Bender et al. 1973; Pate 1994; Smith
1971, 1972). These isotopic signatures are then incorporated into the tissue, including bone collagen,
of humans and other animals that eat those plants.
Most herbs and shrubs, all trees, and temperate

cool-season grasses use the Calvin or C 3 pathway,
named for a three-carbon molecule formed during
C02 assimilation. These plants discriminate against
the heavier 13 C isotope, producing more negative
o13 C values that range between -20 and -35%0, with
a mean of about -27%0 (DeNiro 1987:183;
Ehleringer 1989:41; O'Leary 1988:334). Although
there is substantial variation in the isotopic signatures of C3 plants, no overlap occurs between them
and the other major photosynthetic pathway, the C4
or Hatch/Slack pathway.
Plants such as amaranth, Portulaca, tropical and
warm-season grasses, maize, millet, sugarcane, and
some shrubs in the Euphorbiaceae and
Chenopodiaceae families use the C4 pathway (Pate
1994:172). C4 plants produce a four-carbon molecule during C02 uptake and they do not discriminate against the 13 C isotope as much as C 3 plants
do. Therefore, they have an isotopically heavier
o13 C, with a mean of about -13%0 (O'Leary
1988:334; Stothers and Bechtel 1987: 138) and a
range of -7 to -16%0 (Ehleringer 1989:41; Hard et
al. 1996:264: Pate 1994:173). These plants, with
their more positive values, are said to be isotopically heavier or enriched in 13 C.
Arid land succulents, such as cacti, agave, and
some euphorbs utilize a third photosynthetic pathway, crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). Such
taxa can vary their pathway depending upon if they
uptake C02 diurnally or nocturnally (Ehleringer
1989:41; O'Leary 1981, 1988; Pate 1994:173). The
day-growing group has values within the range of
C 3 taxa and the night group's values are within
those of C4 plants.

Freshwater and Marine Carbon
The 8 13 C value of freshwater fish and fauna are
affected by the influences of both terrestrial C3 and
C 4 sources and have been demonstrated to range
between -23.7%0 and -12.7%0 (Cargill 1996:103;
Katzenberg 1989:323; Schoeninger and DeNiro
1984:629; Tuross et al. 1994:295). The marine 8 13C
value of the dissolved inorganic carbon pool, from
which oceanic life derives its carbon, is positively
enriched about 7.0%o relative to atmospheric carbon (Fry and Sherr 1984: 17). Therefore, most marine plants have 8 13 C values more positive than
terrestrial C3 plants (DeNiro 1987: 187). However,
substantial variability exists in the 8 13C values of
marine organisms that is related to cold vs. warm

Cargill and Hard - Assessing Native American Mobility versus Permanency
water organisms as well as to particular coastal
ecosystems such as seagrass meadows, coral reefs,
algae blooms, and saltmarshes (Cargill 1996:105;
Fry and Sherr 1984:19-20; Little and Schoeninger
1995:358; Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984:628). For
example, the large seagrass meadows of
Syringodium filiformis in the lower Laguna Madre
of Texas exhibit a mean 8 13C value of -5.4%0 and
Halodule wrightii, the dominant seagrass in the
upper Laguna Madre, has a mean 8 13 C value of 10%0 (Fry and Parker 1979:500-501). In fact, 85
percent of the animals analyzed from seagrass meadows from the Gulf of Mexico had 13 C values between -8.3 and -14.5%0. In contrast, offshore animals
had more negative values (between -15.0%0 and
-19 .0%o). In addition, there is some evidence that
there are slight (<1%o) increases in tissue o13 C values for each successive trophic level, although this
may be related to the role of near shore taxa in the
food chain (Fry and Sherr 1984:28, 30).
The 8 13 C values of nearshore marine animals
can mimic those of terrestrial C4 plants; humans
feeding on nearshore taxa may have a similar bone
collagen signature as that of a maize-dependent
population. Fortunately, stable nitrogen isotope
analysis can assist with this discrimination
(Hutchinson et al. 1998; Schoeninger and DeNiro
1983:1381; Walker and DeNiro 1986:56).

o

Terrestrial Nitrogen
Atmospheric nitrogen is 99.64 percent of the
stable isotope 14N, with the remainder ISN. Plants
uptake soil nitrogen isotopes and animals ingest
plant and animal tissue containing nitrogen isotopes. As with carbon, nitrogen isotopes are then
incorporated into amino acids in plant and animal
tissues. Fractionation occurs at various points in
the uptake and metabolic processes, resulting in
variability in the 8 15N values that can be compared
to known samples. Human bone collagen is typically used for archeological samples. Dietary inferences can be made through comparison with the
values of known samples, and by taking into account the fractionation that may have occurred in
the nitrogen uptake and tissue formation processes.
Nitrogen, an essential component of all protein, comprises 79 percent of the atmosphere as N2.
Paradoxically, N2 cannot be directly used by most
organisms, but first must be chemically transformed
through bacterial N 2 fixation. Fixation occurs with

203

bacteria living symbiotically with legumes and rootnoduled, non-leguminous plants, free-living soil
bacteria, and blue-green algae in soil (Smith
1990:258). Bacterial action fixes nitrogen in the
soil by converting it to ammonia, a form that is
plant usable. Fixation occurs in two additional ways:
the breakdown of organic matter, and the combination of atmospheric N 2 with precipitation, also combined with high energy inputs from lightening to
produce usable nitrates (Smith 1990:258). Fractionation can be affected by these fixation processes.
The stable isotope of 14N, relative to 15N, is lost
more rapidly as soil organic matter decomposes,
resulting in o!SN values of -4.0 to +14. Nitrogen
fixing plants have a typical range of -2.0 to +2.0%o
and non-fixing plants have mean values of about
+3.0%o, but a range of 0 to +6.0%o is reported (Pate
1994: 180). Variation in plant oISN may be related
to the degree of nitrogen fixation, climate, and micro-habitat (Ambrose 1993:96). The lSN isotope
value of the same plant species may vary depending on local ecological conditions.
The relationship between the o15N isotope values in animal tissue, such as bone collagen, and
diet is dependent upon the degree that 14N, relative
to isN, is more rapidly gained during the metabolic
and cell formation processes. The o1sN values increase 3-4%0 from that of the ingested plants, for
each successive step up the trophic ladder (Ambrose
1993:97; Pate 1994:180). However, these values
are means from global surveys and there is significant variation among different ecological settings.
For example, herbivores from hot, dry environments
tend to have higher o1sN values than those from
cool, moist environments. This variability is related
to variation in fractionation levels and 8 15N dietary
plant values (Ambrose 1993:97). Therefore, comparisons should be made within, not across, ecosystems. Ideally, samples from all components of the
ecosystem under study should be analyzed in order
to reconstruct diet from bone collagen. Fortunately,
however, there appears to be no significant difference in o15N values among tissues of the same
animal (Ambrose 1991:297).

Freshwater and Marine Nitrogen
Isotope Variation
Stable nitrogen isotope values can potentially
be used to discriminate between terrestrial and
marine diets because marine ecosystems tend to

204

have higher values than most terrestrial systems.
Dissolved atmospheric N 2 in seawater is + 1.0%0.
In addition, much more of the usable nitrogen in
marine and freshwater systems is produced by
bacterial breakdown of organic material into 15 Nenriched nitrates than in terrestrial systems
(Schoeninger and Moore 1992:256). As a result,
aquatic plants at the base of the trophic scale have
8 15N values of about +7%0, 4%o higher than most
terrestrial plants (Ambrose 1993:94; Schoeninger
and Moore 1992:Figure 1). Marine nitrogen-fixing
plants, such as blue green algae, seagrasses, and
saltmarsh grasses such as those found in reef,
mangrove, and saltmarsh ecosystems, may have
o15 N values similar to those of terrestrial
ecosystems. Blue green algae and saltmarsh grasses
have measured 8 15 N values of about+ 1.0%o (Little
and Schoeninger 1995:358; Minagwa and Wada
1984: 1135). Therefore, the distinction between
diets derived from marine ecosystems such as those
with depleted 8 15N values and terrestrial ones is
difficult using stable nitrogen or carbon isotopes
(Ambrose 1993:94).
As with terrestrial systems, there is about a
3%o enrichment of 8 15 N values at each successive
trophic level. However, because of variation
among marine ecosystems, trophic level determinations should only be made within, not between,
ecosystems. For example, from the Usujiri tidal
zone of Japan, primary producers such as seaweed
and phytoplankton have 8 15N value of +6.8%0;
primary consumers (mussels, shore crabs, sea
anemones, and starfish) are +8.5 to +9.5%o; secondary consumers (including fish and octopuses)
are +10.6 to +12.7%o; and tertiary feeders such as
seagulls are +15.6 to +16.8%o (Minagawa and
Wada 1984: 1137). In contrast, lower 8 15 N values
are found in nitrogen-fixing seagrass food webs.
Juvenile shrimp from seagrass meadows along the
South Texas coast have 8 15 N values between +6.0
to +8.0%o (Fry 1983:789), and pinfish from
seagrasses in San Antonio Bay have an average
8 15 N value of +10.2%o (Huebner 1994). Offshore
non-migratory shrimp are +11.8%0 (Fry 1983:794)
and offshore pinfish are 13.6%0 (Huebner 1994).
Fish bone collagen from the Mitchell Ridge site
(41GV66) in Galveston County had 8 15 N values
of +9.9%o for drum and +6.6%0 for gar (Huebner
1994). By examining the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope results from Mission San Juan de
Capistrano with the ecological factors affecting

isotope values, it is possible to make inferences
regarding the dietary history of individuals.

RESULTS OF THE STABLE
ISOTOPE ANALYSES
Delta 13 C values for bone apatite and collagen,
and 8 15N values for bone collagen, for the 19 mission individuals, six faunal species, and two archeological comparative samples are provided in
Table 1. The carbon apatite values are discussed in
Cargill (1996). Individuals from the San Juan de
Capistrano mission exhibit collagen 8 13 C values
that range between -11.8 and -7. 9%o, with a mean
of -9.5%0 and a standard deviation ofÂ± 0.9%0. There
is a 3.9%o difference between the most enriched
and the most depleted 8 13 C value in the mission
sample. Experimental laboratory studies indicate
that animals raised on a monotonous diet should
yield o13C values within l %0 of one another; this
holds true for 8 15N values as well (DeNiro and
Schoeninger 1985). The 8 13 C values of mission
residents, therefore, indicate some variation in food
consumption; however, the range of values reflects
the consumption of C4 plants and animals reliant
upon C 4 plants.
The 8 15 N values are more tightly clustered and
differ by less than 2%o, indicating less variability
in the consumption of dietary protein. The values
range from +11.0 to +12.8%o (see Table 1) with a
mean of + l l.9%o and a standard deviation of Â±
0.5%0. These values are indicative of a diet that
includes freshwater or marine resources. When
8 13 C and 8 15 N values for females and males are
compared, it is apparent that the sexes share similar
isotopic signatures.
The faunal samples exhibit a wide range of
carbon and nitrogen values. For example, catfish
has a 8 13 C value of -20.9%0 and a 8 15N value of
+l0.6%0, while the values for cow are -15.0%0
(8 13 C), with a 8 15N value of +5.7%o. Overall, the
animals that graze or browse have 8 13 C values indicative of a diet based on both C3 and C4 plants. In
South Texas, the presence of C4 grasses is often
reflected in the 8 13 C values of herbivorous animals.
The most negative 8 13 C values are associated with
freshwater catfish and turtle, showing a C3-like
source of freshwater carbon. The 8 15N values indicate that catfish has the most positive value (+ 10.6),
while terrestrial herbivores, as expected, exhibit

by the consumption of freshwater fauna, as well as
C4 and/or CAM plants and animals dependent upon
those plants, including bison. Late Prehistoric bison in Texas have carbon isotopic values ranging
from -13. 7 to -8 .5%o, and nitrogen isotopic values
from +3.2 to +7.6%0 (Huebner and Boutton 1996).
On the other hand, the isotopic signatures may reflect a marine adaptation, as the o13C and 8 15N
values of the individual from 41BX677 are similar
to those observed in Texas' coastal groups and to
predicted values for a subsistence based on
nearshore marine resources.
Inland hunters and gatherers dating from the
Middle Archaic through the Austin phase of the
Late Prehistoric period have o13 C and o 15N values
quite unlike those observed among the Mission San
Juan de Capistrano residents. Both oBC and o 15N
values are more depleted, suggesting the exploitation of a very different resource base. The mean
o 13 C values associated with the Loeve-Fox and
Olmos samples are -19.4 and -17.7%0, respectively
(Huebner, 1995 personal communication). The ()BC
values reported for single individuals at 41WY113
and 41BX952 are -15.7 and -17.7%0, respectively.
Compared to Mission San Juan residents, the ()BC
values from these samples suggest less C4 influence in the diets of inland hunters and gatherers.
The mean o 15N values reported for both Loeve-Fox
and Olmos are +8.0%o. The 8 15N values for the
individuals at 41WY113 and 41BX952 are +7.6%0
and +7.9%o, respectively. The oBC and o 15N values
indicate that inland hunters and gatherers exploited
primarily C3 plants and terrestrial herbivores dependent upon those plants.

CONCLUSIONS
The o 13 C values of human individuals at
Mission San Juan de Capistrano closely resemble
those of maize-dependent populations. However,
maize-dependent populations do not exhibit the
consistently high o15 N values observed in San Juan
residents, unless freshwater fauna contributed
significantly to the diet.
That the Mission San Juan residents regularly
consumed cattle for the decade or more required
for the bone collagen turnover rate, is not supported
by the isotope analysis conducted on herbivores
from the colonial archeological deposits. The cow
and goat/sheep fauna have low 8 15 N values, and

209

populations consuming these terrestrial herbivores
would exhibit relatively low 8 15N values as well;
this contrasts sharply with the elevated o15N values
(+11.0 to +12.8%0) observed in mission individuals. Therefore, the elevated o15N values in Mission
San Juan residents are not consistent with the archeological faunal record that indicates that cow
was a major resource. Neither are the elevated o 15N
values of Mission San Juan residents consistent
with historic mission records indicating that maize
was an important dietary component for mission
residents (Hard et al. 1995; Leutenegger 1976;
Schuetz 1968; Wade 1993).
Enriched o13 C and elevated o15N values similar to those expressed by San Juan residents are
observed in Texas hunting and gathering groups
who exploited marine resources. In fact, given (a)
similar o 13 C and o 15N values observed in prehistoric humans buried near the coast, (b) the historical literature that discusses the recruitment of
neophytes and the recovery of apostates from the
coast, and (c) the fact that many of the known
groups who entered Mission San Juan had premission locations near the coast (see Figure 2), we
believe that the stable isotope values of the Mission
San Juan residents represent a coastal hunting and
gathering adaptation. Furthermore, we believe that
the dominant Native population at Mission San Juan
was originally from the coastal area of Texas and
lived on a mission diet either intermittently or for a
relatively short time.
Based on bone collagen turnover rates, a mission dietary signature should be acquired if an
individual remained at the mission for at least 10+
years consuming a diet comprised primarily of
maize and beef. Schuetz's (1980a) demographic
work at Mission Valero demonstrates that 22 individuals actually occupied the mission from birth
through adulthood (20 through 45 years of age).
Therefore, if stable isotope analysis was conducted
on a complete burial population, at least some
individuals should have carbon and nitrogen values reflecting a mission diet. If the human remains
analyzed from the "Old Church" at Mission San
Juan are representative of the majority of Native
Americans who entered the San Antonio missions,
the stable isotope values suggest that neophytes
did not remain at the mission long enough (10+
years) to have their isotope values affected by a
mission diet. In addition, the demographic profile
of Native American residents at Mission Valero is

210

Texas Archeological Society

characterized by high infant mortality, disease, and
desertions. This, combined with mission documents
that refer to the continual recruitment of neophytes
to replace declining populations, supports the conclusion that the major pattern of mission residency
was of short duration. Furthermore, a coastal dietary signature does not run counter to the historical and archeological evidence that indicates that
maize and beef were main staples of the mission
diet in Texas.

The Gristmill at Mission San Jose y San Miguel de Aguayo:
Insights into the Technology and Agricultural Focus of
Spanish Colonial Texas
James A. Neely

ABSTRACT
An historical perspective is provided for the Mission San Jose and its gristmill, and a detailed description
of the mill emphasizes its unusual technological design. I also evaluate the reconstruction of the gristmill under
the supervision of Ernst Schuchard, and explore the origins and distribution of the side-shot, horizontal waterwheel technology employed in the San Jose mill. Lastly, I consider the adaptive qualities of the San Jose mill
relative to technological, ecological, as well as economic and socio-cultural perspectives. In addition to
providing insights into the agricultural focus and technology of Spanish Colonial Texas, this study defines the
role of this gristmill as a part of the mission complex, and, in the process, contributes views into the religious
and social ambience of a rural Spanish Colonial frontier settlement.

INTRODUCTION
When I first visited the Mission San Jose and
San Miguel de Aguayo, located in San Antonio,
Texas, I was astonished to see the strong similarities in the architectural construction and technical
operating principals of the San Jose gristmill in
relation to those exhibited by the remains of Sasanian and Early Islamic mills that I found during an
archeological study in southwestern Iran some 30
years ago (Neely 1969, 1974, 1998; Neely and
Wright 1994).
A few years later, when I was asked to contribute a paper to the Third International Symposium on Cultural Adaptation at the Edge of the
Spanish Empire (Institute of Latin American Studies, The University of Texas at Austin, March 1991),
I naively thought that a reasonable subject would
be an overview of the nature of Spanish Colonial
milling on the Texas frontier with a focus on the
San Jose mill. I soon learned that this goal was not
attainable within the time frame available. As a
result, my goals for this paper have been modified,
and are neither as optimistic nor as ambitious as
they were when I started.

This paper addresses a number of interrelated
themes: (1) a brief historical overview of the mission and its gristmill; (2) the mill and its technology, as well as the origins and distribution of that
technology; (3) the technological, ecological, and
culturally adaptive qualities of the gristmill as part
of the mission complex; and (4) the role of wheat
vis-a-vis com (otherwise known as maize) as a
cultigen and agricultural product, as well as a staple
of the diet in Colonial Texas and its environs. In the
process of considering the role of the gristmill as
part of the San Jose Mission complex, insights are
contributed into the religious and social ambience
of this rural Spanish Colonial frontier settlement.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON
THE MISSION SAN JOSE
AND ITS GRISTMILL
The Founding of the Mission San Jose
In December 1719, Father Antonio Margil de
Jesus (Presidente of the Missions of the College of
Guadalupe) wrote to the Spanish Governor of Texas,

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 70 (1999)

216

Texas Archeological Society

Don Joseph de Azlor Virto de Vera-the Marques
of San Miguel de Aguayo-requesting him to authorize the founding of Mission San Jose as a mission of the Franciscan College of Zacatecas (Margil
1978). On January 22, 1720, Governor Aguayo
(1978) responded with the "Decree of Aguayo,"
authorizing Lieutenant General Captain Juan Valdez
of the Presidio de San Antonio de Bexar to proceed
with the founding of the Mission San Jose. In March
of the same year, Captain Valdez wrote a detailed
account of the February 23, 1720 founding of the
Mission San Jose (Valdez 1978).
The mission's exact original location is not
recorded; but it is known that it was established on
the east bank of the San Antonio River, about 3
leagues (about 12-14 km) downstream (south) of
the Mission San Antonio de Valero (later known as
the Alamo) (Habig 1968a:84; Valdez 1978:33). The
possible first site of Mission San Jose has been
tentatively located by archeological survey
(Scurlock et al. 1976: 133 and Map 4) about 1.9 km
north-northwest of the mission's present location.
Sometime prior to 1727 the mission was moved to
the west side of the river (Rivera 1978), and in
about 1740 (see Habig's comments in Ciprian
[1978: 95]) the mission was relocated further away
from the river to the place where it stands today
(see Scurlock et al. 1976:Map 4).
With its third, and final, relocation, the mission was situated on a high, relatively old terrace of
the San Antonio River, approximately 14.0 km south
(downstream) of the Mission San Antonio de
Valero. The San Jose Mission was located well
away from the river; more than 650 m from the
closest section of the old river channel (see Scurlock
et al. 1976:Map 1). The Mission was constructed
on a low ridge of the terrace, which extends as a
large prairie to the north and east into the floodplain of the San Antonio River (Brown 1982:55;
Clark 1978:9-10).

Fernandez de Santa Ana remarked on the fertility
of the land and soils in the region, as well as the
capabilities of the San Antonio River. He states,
"From its very origin, it is a river whose power can
be used to run twelve mills" (Santa Ana 1978: 54).
And, in reference to the acequias (canals) that provided waters for irrigation and the domestic needs
of the five San Antonio missions (see also Cox, this
volume), Santa Ana comments: " ... this river shows
no sign of diminution after accommodating five
very abundant withdrawals but seems to be just as
replete" (Santa Ana 1978: 55).
The reader may also obtain some idea as to the
productivity of the soils and land from statements
made by Padre Santa Ana (1978) in 1740 and Padre
Ciprian (1978) in 1749 regarding the types and
quantities of foodstuffs cultivated and harvested.
These data may be further augmented by noting the
increasing architectural construction, and subsequent enlargement of processing and storage facilities, as well as the inventories of foodstuffs
(including the types and quantities of food) found
in the San Jose granary, as enumerated in the inventories by Padres Marmolejo (1978) and Salas
(1978) in 1755 and 1785, respectively.
These early observations, pertaining to the fertility of the soils in the San Antonio region, have
been verified by David Brown's study of the
region's soils and geomorphology. Brown (1982:60)
states, for example, that the Missions Concepcion
and San Jose are surrounded by large areas of
"Prime #1 farmland," the highest category of farmland rated by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service
(Brown 1982:52). John W. Clark, Jr. (1998 personal communication) notes that the acequia and
farm plots associated with the Mission Espada are
still in use by some of the descendants of that
mission's original inhabitants.

PURPOSES AND GOALS
OF THE MISSION
AGRICULTURAL RESOURCE
CAPABILITIES OF THE REGION
From the very founding of the San Jose Mission in 1720, the historical documents frequently
make mention of the immediate region's rich soil,
abundant land resources, and water resources in the
form of springs and rivers (Rivera 1978; Santa Ana
1978; Valdez 1978). In 1740, Father Benito

If one was to enumerate a list of ideal conditions or expectations that had to be met in order for
a Spanish mission to be established and function
well, those dealing with reliable and available water sources and arable lands would be preceded
only by the need for a group of people that could be
proselytized for conversion to the Catholic faith.
By 1749, San Jose mission was widely recognized

Neely -

The Gristmill at Mission San Josey San Miguel de Aguayo

as not only an aesthetically pleasing architectural
complex, but also as a mission that was efficiently
achieving the purposes and goals of the Catholic
Church and the Spanish Government (Ciprian
1978:97, 100; Vallejo 1978:105).
San Jose, like all of the Spanish missions of
that era, functioned to Christianize the Indians and
to provide a Hispanized community to reinforce the
Spanish tenure of New Spain at its northern frontier
against the threats of French incursion (see Santa
Ana 1978:55-56). In order to achieve the latter goals,
the Spanish endeavored to inculcate the Indian converts with the social values and customs of Spanish
culture as well as to teach them useful trades (e.g.,
vaqueros, smiths, weavers, carpenters, etc.) so that
they could become independent members of a
Hispanized community. To facilitate this, the Spanish designed their missions to be comprised not only
of religiously focused buildings to attend the sacred
and spiritual goals, but also to contain a complex of
workshops and work areas to fulfill the secular and
temporal requirements (see Castaneda 1938:27). The
reports and inventories of the 18th century political
leaders and missionaries of the San Antonio region
attest to the nature and increasing complexity of
Mission San Jose's architectural components. In
reading these reports, one also gains an appreciation
for the role of the various kinds of architecture as
material manifestations of the goals of the missions
by noting their size and the permanence of construction, as well as the time and effort expended in their
construction and maintenance (the latter is especially true relative to the canal systems).

ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION
OF THE MISSION SAN JOSE
With its final relocation in about 1740, the
permanent construction of the mission complex began. An adobe church with a flat roof had been
built by 1744 (Espinosa 1964:758). By 1749, Father Ignacio Antonio Ciprian noted that there were
several structures of stone that had been built at the
mission: a convento with an arched formal
entryway, a granary, as well as housing for the
Indian residents (Habig l 968b:48-49). Father
Ildefonso Marmolejo' s 1755 inventory and report
provides a very complete description of the mission. It is apparent that the church had been enlarged and elaborately decorated, inside and out.

217

Although he does not mention the construction materials employed, it is likely that at least a portion
of the church was made of stone. Marmolejo's description of the mission architecture includes the
granary and the 84 stone houses of the village area,
as well as the 12 stone houses of the hamlet or
pueblo, with the latter probably located outside the
mission's walls. He also mentions several workshops, many made of stone masonry, including a
carpenter's shop, a blacksmith shop, a weaving
shop, and a sugar mill (Marmolejo 1978:126).
In his 1768 report concerning the mission, Father Gaspar Jose de Solis states that the mission
was protected by a surrounding compound wall
that had four gates and two corner bastions. He also
noted that the Indian quarters were built inside the
compound, against a part of this wall, as well as the
presence of a carpenter shop, a tailor shop, a blacksmith shop, lime and brick kilns, and a well (Solis
1931:19-21, 1978: 144-145). Outside the compound
were located the tannery, another smithy, a sugar
mill, cattle pens, a matadero, and other structures.
It was evidently at this time that, inside the compound, the original granary had been modified to a
vaulted structure made of stone, and had been enlarged to hold more than 5000 bushels of corn and
other crops. The interior dimensions of this enlarged granary are about 6.1 m wide, 30.5 m long,
and 4.6 m high (Clark 1978:37). Finally, the report
of Father Jose Francisco Lopez (1940) in 1789 notes
essentially the same architecture.
Thus, in spite of the relatively well documented
rapid growth of the mission and the construction of
substantial, permanent architecture, there is no mention of a gristmill having been constructed or in
service. In fact, in his 1791 letter to Governor
Manuel Munoz, Commandant General Juan
Gutierrez de la Cueva (1978:272) states that the
area lacked " ... grinders (i.e., gristmills?) for making pinole ... " Furthermore, between 1791and1793
there are several references (e.g., Lava 1983a:l7,
1983b:56, 1983c:27) to the purchase and shipment
of manos and metates to the Mission San Jose and
the other missions in the vicinity, indicating that
the gristmill was not in operation. I should also
mention that the sugar mill, noted in Padre
Marmolejo's Inventory of 1755, was evidently a
true sugar mill and, therefore, not to be confused
with the gristmill. This is verified in the 1794 inventory of Governor Manuel Munoz (1983:131),
where both, "A water mill for grinding wheat that

218

is operated by a running stream, but no [i.e., lacks
a] dam [i.e., sluice gate?]," and "Another one [i.e.,
water mill] for pressing sugar cane," are listed.
Thus, there were two completely different, but, as
will be explained shortly, probably interrelated water-driven milling mechanisms and systems at Mission San Jose.

HISTORY OF THE SAN JOSE MILL

(sometime in the period between 1859 and 1864)
by the occupants of the mission in an attempt to
dislodge Indians attacking the mission who had
taken refuge in the milling room and were using it
as a defensive position.
Mention of the San Jose gristmill is not found
again until 1933. Works Project Administration
(WPA) workers, under the direction of Harvey
Smith and Ernst Schuchard for the San Antonio
Conservation Society, discovered the mill that year
while excavating the acequia that passes just north
of the mission (Schuchard 1936).

Although a 1779 document (Croix l 779b) mentions that the Padre Presidente of the Missions intended to build a water-driven gristmill (molino),
the first definite reference to the presence of a gristDESCRIPTION OF THE MILL
mill at Mission San Jose is in 1794. This definite
reference appears in an inventory that has been

The general consensus is that the mill was designed and built by Padre Pedrajo (Guerra
1982:8, 38; Habig 1968a; Rio 1801:78-85);
however, one might suspect that the design
was by another person trained in such construction and that the mill was built by the
mission Indians under that person's direction.
As was often the practice of the time, the design and construction of the mill was probably
attributed to Pedrajo because he was the Padre

The main acequia courses generally
from west-to-east between the ridge
scarp and the northern wall of the mission compound. The gristmill was constructed into the steep face of the ridge,
about 7 m north of the main canal
(Figure 1; Clark 1978:Figures 1, 3). It
was thus placed so that some of the
water from the canal could be diverted
for power to drive the mill-wheel.
Once having driven the mill-wheel,
the water flowed through the millrace
toward the north, probably to fields
and orchards for irrigation. The gristmill at the Mission San Jose may be
best described in relation to its major
architectural and technological component parts and how they interrelate.

section, below, for additional discussion of the
function of this feature).

THE WHEEL ROOM
The wheel room had a vaulted ceiling (Figure
4); was rectangular in plan view (Figure 5); was
oriented with its long-axis running north-south; and
was constructed by cutting into the steep face of the
ridge (see Clark 1978:Figure I la). The long axis of
this room lay under the western portion of the milling room. The dimensions of the wheel room were
2.28 m (E-W) x 4.20 m (N-S), and 2.75 min maximum height. The water-wheel was located directly
below the milling room (see Figure 3), and was
attached, by means of a long, thick drive shaft of
wood, directly to the uppermost of the two milling
grindstones. The drive shaft and the upper grindstone could be raised (to disengage) and lowered
(to engage) by means of an ingenious tram-rod
framework that traveled in grooves constructed into
the masonry side walls of the vaulted wheel room
(see Figure 5). The water-wheel was about 1.60 m
in diameter, and was situated at the back of the
wheel room so that its outer edge rotated only a few
centimeters from the wheel room's south wall. The
holding tank's wooden flume jet extended through
the south wall of the wheel room (see Figures 3 and

5) and was pointed downward at about a 35 to 40
degree angle. It is possible that the diameter of the
wooden flume jet was further constricted by means
of some sort of insert (see Avitsur 1960:40-41, 45
and Figures l and 2), thereby increasing the pressure of the jet of water striking the blades of the
water-wheel or turbine. The flume jet was located
above and slightly west of the eastern edge of the
water-wheel. Water flowing through the penstock's

rectangular wooden flume jet would hit the upper
and outer edges of the blades or "feathers" and
drive the turbine-like wheel in a counter-clockwise
direction. As will be noted later, this direction of
the wheel rotation is extremely significant in determining the possible origins of this technology.
The wheel room was constructed of mortared
stone masonry with a floor of large flagstones. Excavation revealed that the flagstone floor of the
room extended outward to the north. At the west
side of the entrance to the vaulted wheel room, a
set of stone stairs led upward to the
ground surface (see Figures 3 and
5). To the east of these stairs was
found an open area leading from the
room at its floor level (see Figure 5).
This open area became a type of
canal that served as the "tail" of the
millrace and led northward for about

was started in 1936 and completed in 1937
(Schuchard 1936, and Schuchard's notes and
drawings in the Daughters of the Texas Revolution
Library, San Antonio, Texas). Thus, the mill that is
seen today is the result of some four years of
research and manual labor. The excavation of the
mill was sponsored by the San Antonio
Conservation Society. The Colonial Dames of Texas
furnished the money for the reconstruction of the
mill building. The Pioneer Flour Mills built and
installed all of the replicas of the old mill machinery.
Apparently the only reports concerning the four
years of work on the Mission San Jose gristmill
were two short articles published in equally obscure journals. Both of these articles, one published
by Smith, Sr. (1935) and the other by Ernst
Schuchard (1939), described the excavation of the
gristmill and its subsequent reconstruction. In spite
of their brevity, these articles provide excellent information relative to what was found during the
excavation of the mill, and on what extant data the
gristmill reconstructions were based.
Evidently the holding tank, the wheel room,
and the milling room, as they are seen today, are
either as they were found, or reconstructed accurately to the form indicated during the last use of
the mill. There are three exceptions to this statement: (1) the nature and height of the upper walls,
the locations of the windows, and the form and
construction of the roof of the milling room (in this
regard it appears that Schuchard followed, at least
in part, the description presented by Hoermann
[1932]); (2) the majority of the internal characteristics of the milling room, including the grain milling
equipment and machinery; and (3) the exact nature
of the wooden flume jet and the turbine-like waterwheel in the wheel room.
One might wonder about Schuchard's interpretation of the technological and architectural data
exposed during the WPA excavations. In my opinion, his interpretation that a horizontal or "sideshot" water-wheel was present is accurate. I also
generally agree with his reconstruction of the mill's
equipment, mechanics, and architecture based on
the tangible evidence found during the excavation
of the San Jose mill (Schuchard 1936), and on
comparative information from similar gristmills
found elsewhere (see "Origins and Distribution"
section below).
It is possible that more precise information,
useful in the process of reconstruction, might have

been recovered during the excavation of this
gristmill. However, this cannot be determined since
the excavation was not accomplished by an
archeologist using more modern, controlled
archeological excavation methods.

FURTHER OBSERVATIONS
RESULTING FROM THE STUDY
OF THE SAN JOSE MILL
I had several expectations at the start of this
study, namely that the San Jose gristmill was, perhaps, a rather unique phenomenon on the Spanish
Colonial frontier; that the mill was built shortly
after the founding of the Mission; that the choice
of the gristmill technology was largely based on
cultural preference; and that there was planting,
harvesting, and use of much wheat with the beginning of the Spanish Colonial period. However, as
my research on the gristmill progressed, I discovered that these were preconceived assumptions that
were not true.

THE ORIGINS AND DISTRIBUTION
OF THE SIDE-SHOT, HORIZONTAL
WATER-WHEEL TECHNOLOGY
I was surprised to find that gristmills of the
type at the San Jose Mission have a greater antiquity and a much broader distribution than I had
imagined. This type of gristmill, having a horizontal or "side-shot" water-wheel, an early form of
turbine, has been variously called the "Norse" mill
and the "Greek" mill in the literature (e.g., Forbes
1955, Vol. 2:89; Forbes 1957; Singer 1957, Vol. 2:
593-595; Wulff 1966:280). It is seen to have had a
long history of use and a distribution that spans the
area from China through the Middle East to western Europe, from Denmark and the British Isles
south to Portugal, Spain, Sicily, Italy, Greece, as
well as parts of North and South Africa.
While my discovery of this type of gristmill on
the Deh Luran Plain of southwestern Iran (Neely
1974) in association with the Early Sasanian period
occupation (ca. A.D. 225-425) represents one of
the earliest well-dated examples of this mill
technology, there are evidently earlier examples
from both Greece and what is now Turkey. Such
technology can be traced back to at least 85 B.C.,

when Anti pater of Thessalonica makes reference to
a similar gristmill (Anderson 1935; Bennett and
Elton 1899, Vol. 2:6; Forbes 1955, Vol. 2:89).
Strabo states that the Parthian king Mithridates
constructed a comparable mill for his palace in
Pontus in 65 B.C. (Anderson 1935; Bennett and
Elton 1899, Vol. 2:7; Wulff 1966:280).
Perhaps as a statement of, and tribute to, its
efficiency in certain environmental situations, it is
interesting to note that gristmills with this relatively simple technology have persisted in use into
modern times throughout the Old World. Alphabetically by location, such gristmills have been
found functioning into the 19th and 20th centuries
in: Azerbaijan (Wulff 1966); China (Hsing 1966);
Crete and Cyprus (Reynolds 1970); Denmark
(Steensberg 1952); England and Wales (Wilson
1960); Faeroe Islands (Williamson 1946); France
(Wilson 1960); Germany (Wilson 1960); Greece
(Curwen 1945; Hunter 1967); the Hebrides and
Orkney Islands (Curwen 1938); Iran (Beazley 1965,
1977; Neely 1969, 1974, 1998; William Sumner,
1977 personal communication; Wulff 1966:280283), Ireland (Goudie 1886; Lucas 1953); Isle of
Man (Wilson 1960); Israel and Palestine (Avitsur
1960); Norway and Sweden (Reynolds 1970); Portugal (author's 1994 personal observations; Oliveira
et al. 1983; Wade 1990, 1993); Rumania (Reynolds
1970; Wilson 1960); Shetland Islands (Beasley
1963; Goudie 1886); Sicily (Ayala 1993); South
Africa (Reynolds 1970; Wilson 1960); Spain
(Hunter 1967; Rossello i Verger 1989); Switzerland (Reynolds 1970); Turkey (Bryer 1978; Makal
1949; Stirling 1965; Wagstaff 1973); and Yugoslavia (Hunter 1967). I suspect this form of mill was
present, and may still be in use today, in other rural
areas of the Old World as well.
As yet, the date and place of origin of this
technology is not known. However, as noted above,
it evidently predates 85 B.C. And, because of two
characteristics, it seems more likely that the origin
of the Spanish Colonial mills can be traced to
somewhere in the Mediterranean area or the Middle
East. The two most characteristic attributes that are
associated with the Mediterranean and Middle
Eastern gristmills are: (1) the use of the watertower or penstock to build a head of water of
sufficient power to efficiently turn the water-wheel;
and (2) the counter-clockwise direction of rotation
of the water-wheels in Mediterranean and Middle
Eastern mills, which is regionally quite distinct from

223

the clockwise direction of rotation of the waterwheel in the gristmills of northern Europe (Curwen
1944; Storck and Teague 1952:97). The introduction
of the side-shot, horizontal water-wheel gristmill to
the New World seems most likely to have taken
place by means of a Spanish vector; taking the
technology first to Mexico and South America, and
then northward to the Colonial frontier of what is
now Texas, New Mexico, and California.
There is plentiful evidence for the construction of gristmills in Mexico as early as the mid16th century. Within a few decades they had become
quite numerous in the main areas of wheat production. Unfortunately, the documents are remarkably
lacking in descriptive details of the mills and their
functioning technology. If the precise location of at
least one of the 16th century Mexican gristmills
can be determined, a detailed archeological excavation of that site would be well warranted.
Zavala (1982) notes that between 1551 and
1552 there was a large number of requests for governmental permission to construct gristmills in the
state of Michoacan. In the state of Puebla, Prem
(1978:200-201, 299) reports that, in the area of
Atlixco and Huetjozingo, permits for at least 23
gristmills were submitted between 1542 and 1640.
Between 1557 and 1559, the Franciscans constructed a gristmill in eastern Puebla, in the San
Pablo Valley (Licate 1981: 109). In the Basin of
Mexico, between 41 and 66 licenses to build gristmills had been granted between 1581 and 1607
(Prem 1992:457). Two of these mills were built in
the San Juan Teotihuacan Valley, located some 35
km to the northeast of Mexico City. These two
mills have also been recorded on maps that show
the presence of these structures along canals or
streams. One of these maps dates to 1581 (Acufia
1986:214-215; Nuttall 1926:41-84), while the second map dates to 1585 (Archivo General del Nacion
[Mexico] Tierras, Vol. 1649, exp. 1, f. 12-AGN
Catalog No. 1167). Gibson (1964:79) also briefly
mentions the presence of gristmills in the area of
Tepetlaoztoc, a cabecera located in the Acolhua
foothills to the northeast of Texcoco, dating to the
mid-17th century.
Ernst Schuchard discovered a mill near Mexico
City in 1937 that had two adjacent horizontal waterwheels in the same structure. The mill was part of a
large hacienda complex known locally as the
"Molino de Flores" (Schuchard 1939:9). Recent
correspondence with Thomas H. Charlton (1995

224

Texas Archeological Society

personal communication) has revealed that the
gristmill Schuchard referred to is most likely part
of the Hacienda Molino de Flores that is located
just 3 km east of the city of Texcoco on the road to
the Baths of Netzahualcoyotl, between Texcoco and
San Miguel Tlaixpan. A rapid investigation into the
hacienda mentioned by Charlton indicates that the
hacienda is now part of the "Parque Nacional
Molino de Flores-Netzahualcoyotl" (SEDUE n.d.).
A review of the index of Mercedes in the Archivo
General de la Nacion (Colin 1967:343-344)
indicates that in 1585 Pedro de Duenas was granted
a merced to construct a gristmill at his hacienda in
the barrio of Tuzcacuaco. This hacienda
subsequently had several owners. After 1667, the
hacienda became the property of Don Antonio
Flores de Valdez, and was from that time known as
the "Molino de los Flores," later becoming "Molino
de Flores." Charles Gibson (1964:331) notes that:
"A series of remarkable letters written between 1775
and 1765 by the administrator of the Hacienda de
Molino de Flores near Texcoco to the hacienda
owner in Mexico City describes more fully than
any other known documents the daily life and
economy of the late Colonial hacienda."
The index of Mercedes (Colin 1967:344) also
lists two other mills that existed in the vicinity of
Texcoco in 1586: one constructed by Don Juan
Maldonado de Montejo in the barrio of Cuzquana
and the second owned by Francisco Garcia. From
the way this merced is worded, it appears that the
gristmills of Don Juan Maldonado de Montejo,
Francisco Garcia, and Pedro de Duenas were situated, in that respective order from upstream to
downstream, along the Rio Coxcacuacos. Although
direct evidence is lacking, it is assumed that these
two mills employed the same technology as that
evinced at the Molino de Flores.
South of Mexico, there is also evidence of
gristmills utilizing this technology. There may well
be a gristmill of this type in El Salvador that dates
to the 16th or 17th century (William R. Fowler,
1995 personal communication). David 0. Brown
(1995 personal communication) reports two mills
in Ecuador that definitely have the horizontal water-wheel technology. One of these, at the Hacienda de Todos Santos near the town of Cuenca,
dates to ca. 1547. The second is a system of four
water-wheels in a single building at the Molinos de
Monserrat, also near Cuenca, evidently constructed
by the Spanish Jesuits in 1756.

Returning to the northern Spanish Colonial
frontier in Texas, the literature indicates that there
were at least three gristmills employing the horizontal water-wheel technology that had been constructed in the San Antonio area in the mid-to late
1700s. The earliest, according to A. T. Jackson
(1971:10-12), was a mill named the Molino Blanco.
It was constructed on the San Antonio River not far
from the Alamo in 1733, and was in operation until
about 1830. This mill is reported to have had the
same horizontal water-wheel technology as that of
the San Jose mill. I have as yet found no other
reference to the technology employed at, or the
early date given to, this mill by Jackson.
In about 1780, or a little later, a mill was built
for the Mission Nuestra Senora Purisima
Concepcion de Acuna, located on the east side of
the San Antonio River about 900 m north-northwest of the Mission San Jose (Ivey et al. 1985: 193).
The mill was probably constructed in response to
the 1778 order given by Governor Domingo Cabell
for all the missions to begin growing wheat and
barley (Morfi 1935:229, 1967:105), and commented
on in the letter of Teodoro de Croix (1778). It was
evidently situated on the steep bank of the San
Antonio River about 270 m north of the mission,
where the mission road from the Villa de San Antonio passed close by the river. This location was a
good deal further from the mission than was the
site of the San Jose mill. A branch of the Mission
Concepcion acequia supplied water to power the
mill. Its design is reported to have been the same as
that of the San Jose gristmill. I have not yet found
further data pertaining to this mill.
The San Jose gristmill, apparently constructed
in about 1794, was thus the third mill to be constructed in the San Antonio region. It may also have
been constructed in response to the 1778 orders to
grow wheat and barley given by Governor Cabell.
After about 1824, however, a number of similar mills were constructed in the San Antonio area
and other parts of Central Texas. For example, the
Yturri-Edmunds mill was constructed about 1.1 km
to the north-northeast of Mission Concepcion in
about 1824 (Scurlock et al. 1976:107). Also in the
San Antonio area, the Ashley mill was driven by a
turbine water-wheel (see Scurlock et al. 1976:Figure 48a), and may have had this form of wheel
since about 1838 with the construction of its variously named predecessors (Scurlock et al.
1976:235). The Higginbotham-Kerr mill was

Neely - The Gristmill at Mission San Josey San Miguel de Aguayo 225
founded in about 1842 (Scurlock et al. 1976:56).
Furthermore, other gristmills in Central Texas with
horizontal water-wheels dating to the 1850s (such
as the mills at McKinney Falls State Park
[McEachern and Ralph 1981] near Austin, Texas,
and at the Landmark Inn State Park [Parsons and
Burnett 1984] near Castroville, Texas) indicate the
technology survived and flourished into the mid19th century and later.
The technology of operation of the San Jose
mill was evidently not restricted to the Central Texas
area, for A.T. Jackson (1971) reports the presence
of similar mills during the Colonial Period in two
other locations in Texas. A mill, employing a horizontal water-wheel, was built at San Agustine de la
Isle ta on the Rio Grande in El Paso County, approximately 15 km southeast of the present city of
El Paso. It functioned from about 1718 to 1790
(Jackson 1971:5). The second Colonial gristmill
mentioned by Jackson was constructed at the Mission Nuestra Senora de los Dolores de los Ais. It is
near the modern town of San Augustine and about
50 km east-southeast of the present city of
Nacogdoches, Texas. This mill had a horizontal
water-wheel, and was in operation from 1721 to
about 1773, or perhaps a bit later (Jackson 1971:5).
Jackson does not provide sources for his information on these two mills, and I have not as yet found
mention of them elsewhere in the literature.
In addition, I have found reference to the use
of this same gristmill technology in several locations outside of Texas. New Mexico has many mills
that used horizontal water-wheels. A few of these
are still in operation or have been reconstructed to
working order. They are found in the more isolated
Hispanic communities in the northern part of the
state. Such mills have been reported for the communities of Manzano (Torrance County); Pena
Blanca (Sandoval County); Ojo Caliente (Taos
County); Chamita and Chimayo (Rio Arriba
County); as well as Santa Cruz, La Cienega,
Pojoaque, and Nambe (Santa Fe County). The earliest of the New Mexico gristmills, with horizontal
water-wheel technology, was evidently constructed
in the city of Santa Fe, and dates to 1756. By 1776,
Santa Fe had three such mills in operation. Charles
Gritzner (1974), a geographer, has located approximately 50 mills of this type in New Mexico.
Four Spanish Colonial period gristmills of this
type have been recorded in California (Ward and
Kurutz 1974:142-146). The earliest of these mills

was evidently constructed in 1794 in the northern
part of the state at the Mission Santa Cruz. Another
was constructed at the Mission San Gabriel Archangel, near Pasadena, California, sometime between
1810 and 1823. The third mill was built at the
Mission San Antonio de Padua. The fourth California gristmill that could be determined as having
this technology has been reported at the Mission
San Louis Obispo.
It seems very likely that there were many more
gristmills located throughout Mexico, and along
the Spanish Colonial frontier in what is now the
greater American Southwest. Although gristmills
do not seem to have been important enough, or
unusual enough, for the chroniclers to focus upon,
one can often come across tantalizing passing references to the existence of mills that are usually
exasperatingly void of detail. For example, Dunne
(1948:217) relates the inventory for the mission
pueblo of Satev6, located about 77 km south-southwest of Chihuahua City, for the year 1753. In this
inventory there are references to: " ... a well-equipped
mill ... " and "Near the mill was another piece of
ground ... " (Archivo General de Indias, Audiencia
de Guadalajara 67-4-2).

THE ADAPTIVE QUALITIES OF
THE SAN JOSE MILL AND ITS
TECHNOLOGY
The adaptive qualities of the San Jose mill
water-wheel may be considered in three complimentary, interrelated perspectives: (1) a general,
technological perspective; (2) a specific, ecological
perspective that is relevant not only to the San Jose
mill but the majority of the mills found to employ
the horizontal water-wheel technology; and (3) an
economic and socio-cultural perspective.

The General, Technological
Perspective
Relative to the mano and metate, the waterdriven mill was undoubtedly a more efficient device. Two questions that arise, however, are just
how much more efficient was it and was there a
difference in the type of efficiency seen? A recent
experiment (Mauldin 1993) measured the amount
of time it took a woman experienced in the use of

226

Texas Archeological Society

the mano and metate to process one kg of toasted
com to flour. The results of this experiment, seen to
vary according to the size of the grinding area of
the mano and metate, ranged from about 18 minutes for the smallest mano/metate set used to less
than 6 minutes with the largest mano/metate set
(Mauldin 1993:319). The rate of flour production
of gristmills with horizontal water-wheels is also
quite varied, depending on the size of the waterwheel and the grinding stones; the type, condition
and weight of the grinding stones; as well as the
velocity of the grinding stone rotation. The sparse
flour production data I have been able to assemble
for relatively small, rural gristmills range from about
3.5 kg per hour for very small mills in Deh Luran,
Iran (Abdula Javadi, 1969 personal communication); 10 to 15 kg per hour for small mills of this
type in the mountainous northeastern region of Portugal (Wade 1993:39); 27.3 kg per hour for mills in
Shetland (British Isles) (Goudie 1886); 50 to 60 kg
of meal per hour for medium size mills in Ancora,
Portugal (Wade 1993:39); and 68.3 kg to 151.8 kg
per hour (depending on the flow of water available)
for a mill in Shiraz, Iran (Wulff 1966:280-281).
Unfortunately, there is no productivity data for the
San Jose mill, and even an estimate would be difficult because there is no information as to the exact
nature and size of the water-wheel and other parts
of the grinding machinery. However, even if we
assume that small, very crude water-driven gristmills of this type were only as productive as the
hand-manipulated mano and metate relative to the
volume of grain processed per hour, the waterdriven gristmill can still be considered to be more
efficient as it could be more easily operated continuously for 24 hours a day.
In relation to water mills of other design, how
efficient was the side-shot horizontal water-wheel
technology of the San Jose mill? Dr. Paul L. Czibesz
(1953), an engineer affiliated with the Southwest
Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, considered the technological design of the San Jose mill's
water-wheel to be quite efficient. Czibesz stated
that, in spite of its rustic and rather primitive construction, using mostly wood rather than metal for
its component parts and bearing surfaces, the horizontal "turbine" water-wheel design may be judged
to have been approximately twice as efficient as the
overshot and the undershot vertical water-wheels.
He based his judgment as to this greater efficiency
on two factors. First, it is a more efficient use of the

pent-up or stored potential power or energy of a
stream of water. Second, in spite of the relatively
primitive and high friction characteristics of the
materials of construction, the direct-drive nature of
the San Jose system, where one rotation of the
water-wheel resulted in one rotation of the milling
or grinding stone, was more efficient than the geared
overshot or undershot water-wheels where the vertical motion of the water wheel had to be converted
to the rotation of a horizontal milling or grinding
stone. The latter observation may be fundamentally
correct, however, Dr. Czibesz does not mention the
relative efficiency of the horizontal water-wheel as
compared to the overshot or undershot water-wheel
when the motion of the vertical wheel is converted,
by gearing, to produce several revolutions of the
milling/grinding stone for every single rotation of
the water-wheel. John W. Clark, Jr. (1998 personal
communication) observes that the use of wood for
gears, shafts, bearings, etc., in the construction of
gristmills and other mechanical contrivances was
quite common well into the 19th century in Texas
and northern Mexico.
Another aspect of the technology incorporated in this mill, that may have played an integral
role in its efficiency, was not considered by
Czibesz. The particular design of the side-shot
horizontal water-wheel lends itself well to the use
of a component feature that is often found in association. The associated holding tank or penstock
provides the pressure of a water column to supply
a sufficiently powerful jet of water that is great
enough to overcome the weight, inertia, and friction of the system in order to start the water-wheel
rotating. This jet of water subsequently also imparts a vortex action to the water that has collected on the floor of the wheel room. This vortex
action, in turn, serves to speed-up the wheel rotation and thereby achieves greater efficiency in the
milling process.
We might consider the efficiency of the
horizontal water-wheel at the San Jose Mission in
relation to yet another factor. Clark's (197 6)
interpretation of a masonry feature, found in his
1974 excavations just north of the San Jose canal
and just east of the gristmill, provides additional
information on the gristmill complex. Clark
interprets the feature he found as being part of the
mission's Ingenio (sugar mill) complex. Since
Governor Mufioz' (1983: 131) inventory states that,
by 1794, the sugar mill was water-powered, Clark

Neely -

The Gristmill at Mission San Josey San Miguel de Aguayo

makes an argument for the sugar mill being attached
to, and driven by, the water-wheel of the gristmill.
Although Clark (1991 personal communication)
now has some doubts that the feature was as he
originally interpreted it, I still find his argument
viable and intriguing. Since we know that sugar
processing required a great deal of water and that
the sugar mill was water-powered, there were few,
if any, other reasonable places in the San Jose
mission complex where it could have been located
to obtain the water required. The point being that
the technological efficiency of the San Jose Mission
horizontal water-wheel was increased if, in fact, it
powered two mills.

The Specific, Ecological
Perspective
Another consideration of the adaptive efficiency of the San Jose mill may be seen in its
topographic location or situation in relation to the
quantity of water available at a high enough velocity to drive the water-wheel. A review of the literature that describes the topography and water supply
of the immediate environs of the gristmills that
employed this form of horizontal water-wheel indicates that they were located in or on hilly or steep
terrain and that the quantity of water available was
relatively small and/or that the velocity of the water
flow was relatively slow. In other words, the horizontal water-wheel and its associated holding tank
or penstock technology permitted the use of a gristmill where the extant topography of the land would
not have readily permitted the construction of a
vertical-wheeled mill and where a relatively small
and/or slow flow of water would not have been
sufficient to efficiently run a mill of the verticalwheeled design.

The Economic and
Socio-Cultural Perspective
Having established the technological and ecological efficiency of this milling machinery, one
may see certain distinct advantages to the changes
that took place in the processing of grains at Mission San Jose. However, "efficiency" and "advantages" are seldom the sole motivation for changing
long-lived traditions. What were the factors that
influenced the change from the old technology (i.e.,

227

mano and metate) to the new gristmill and from the
old staple crop of corn to the introduction of wheat?
This section discusses some possible economic and
socio-cultural motivating factors that led to these
changes.
Let me first deal with the gristmill. As has
been amply illustrated, my assumption that the gristmill was built shortly after Mission San Jose had
been moved to its third, and present, location was
evidently not correct. A search of the archival documentation and archeological literature indicates that
the task of grain processing at the San Jose Mission
was accomplished by hand, using the simple technology of the mano/metate and mortar/pestle, prior
to the construction of the gristmill.
The presence and use of the mano/metate and/
or mortar/pestle in most, if not all, of the Indian
houses at the. San Jose mission, as well as in the
mission's kitchen, is indicated in three very complete inventories of the mission by Padre Marmolejo
(1978:115) in 1755, Governor Barrios y Jauregui
(1978: 131-132) in 1758, and Padre Salas (1978) in
1785. There are also accountings for the years 1792
and 1793, by the Father General Ygnacio Maria
Lava (l 983a: 17, l 983c:27), that list metates as one
of the items in the supplies being sent to the San
Jose mission from Zacatecas, Mexico. The origins
and history of the mano/metate and mortar/pestle in
the San Antonio area has not yet been thoroughly
researched. However, it is known that there was a
long history of Indian manufacture and use of these
tools in the processing of wild foodstuffs (Fox
1989:32). My preliminary research indicates that
the first manos and metates used at the San Jose
mission were probably very similar to the traditional one-handed, modified-cobble manos and the
only slightly modified slab or boulder metate types
found in the prehistoric sites of the region (e.g.,
Hall et al. 1982:372-385; Hall et al. 1986:320-331;
Jelks 1962:54-55). Later, however, the more stylized and formalized footed-metates from Mexico
became more prevalent.
But why was the gristmill not constructed
earlier in the history of the San Jose mission, and
why was it finally built in 1794? The answers to
these questions are not readily evident from the
documents of the time, and it seems likely that
there may well have been several interrelated
answers to each of these questions, rather than just
one. As will be expanded upon below, however, it
is evident that com, and not wheat, was perhaps the

228

Texas Archeological Society

only grain cultivated in the San Antonio region
until about 1779. This may have been at least part
of the reason why the gristmill was not introduced
until wheat was included as part of the grain crop:
because the gristmill was able to grind wheat more
efficiently (i.e., produce a finer flour) than the mano
and metate. The tradition of mano and metate use,
and more specifically the grinding of com with the
mano and metate, had by the 1700s been firmly
imbedded in the Indian cultures of what is now
Northern Mexico and Texas. However, in addition
to this imbeddedness of tradition, discussed more
fully below, there may well have been two other
explanations for the questions posed above.
First, as has been pointed out by Wade
(1993:97-103), one possible reason why the gristmill was not constructed at Mission San Jose may
well have been due to the complex interrelationship
of the general goals of the mission: to attend to the
Indian's sacred and spiritual needs as well as to
fulfill their secular and temporal requirements. In
Spain's religiously-oriented value system and moral
discourse, dedicated secular work, that fulfilled the
temporal requirements of life, also served to fulfill
the sacred goal of spiritual salvation of the sinners
(i.e., the Indians). In his poem "Carmen for King
Robert," Adalbero, Bishop ofLaon wrote: " ... some
were to order, some to obey and those that obeyed,
as punishment worked" (Duby 1980:50-55, 165166). Thus, the labor-saving gristmill may purposefully not have been introduced by the friars
so that the Indians had plenty of work to do
throughout the year.
Second, the timing of the introduction of the
gristmill at Mission San Jose may have been the
result of at least four factors. The first of these may
have been the demand in the late 1700s for such
technology by the general non-Indian populace of
the San Antonio area. This demand came from the
desire to produce a product (i.e., flour) that would
not only be locally consummed, but would also be
tradeable or saleable outside of the region (see Croix
l 779b). The second factor may have been the 1778
orders and urgings by the political and religious
leaders from Mexico for the Texas missions to start
growing wheat. This encouragement was probably
based on their desire to make the Texas missions
more self-reliant in the food they produced so that
staples did not have to be imported from Mexico.
In addition, since the wheat crops had failed in
Iberia over the previous few years, they may have

looked upon Texas as a possible source for wheat
to be exported to Spain. Third, with the onset of the
secularization of the missions, the missions were
slowly losing their labor force as the Indians left. A
gristmill would have allowed the time and energy
of a reduced work force to be reallocated from
grain processing to other necessary tasks. Fourth,
and finally, as will be discussed below, it appears
that Mission San Jose was given the responsibility
of supplying foodstuffs and other materials to the
other San Antonio missions, as well as to several
presidios. Thus, it may have been due to several of
the preceding factors, and very probably some that
have yet to be defined, that the gristmill was constructed at Mission San Jose.
There are several bits of information that would
suggest that at least some of the tentative explanations presented above are correct. Jackson's
(1971:10-12) reference to the Molino Blanco and
Croix' ( 1779b) notation concerning the cattle-driven
mill (taona), both situated in San Antonio, certainly indicate that the secular farmers were grinding flour, and thereby would have presented an
economic competition and threat to the missions.
Also, while Mandujano's (1983:264) 1809 census
of Mission San Jose specifically mentions that San
Jose, " .... maintains a mill that still grinds wheat,"
Salcedo's (1983) general census of 1809 does not
mention the presence of a gristmill at the other
three missions in the San Antonio area. The information supplied by these two documents implies
that San Jose may have been grinding flour for all
of the missions. The extremely large granary at
Mission San Jose, mentioned above, would perhaps
also suggest that it may have been the repository of
foodstuffs from and for the other missions in the
area. In addition to the competition with the secular
populace of the area and supplying the three other
major missions in the area, San Jose had yet a
further economic burden: to furnish supplies to the
presidios of San Antonio, La Bahfa del Espiritu
Santo, San Saba, El Orcoquisac, and Los Adaes.
This is indicated in the 1767-1768 report on Mission San Jose written by Solis (1978:145, 157).
Quite admittedly, the case I have built above is
based on circumstantial evidence. In addition, there
are some inexplicable factors that throw some doubt
on my reconstruction. For example, the alleged presence of a gristmill built for Mission Nuestra Senora
Purisima Concepcion de Acuna in about 1780, or a
little later (Ivey et al. 1985: 193), certainly presents

Neely -

The Gristmill at Mission San Josey San Miguel de Aguayo

problems relative to the explanation presented
above. The problem in evaluating this inconsistency is the fact that I have not been able to find
any other reference to, or information about, the
alleged mill at Mission Concepcion. On the other
hand, even if further evidence for the existence of
the Mission Concepcion mill does come to light, it
is possible that the Mission Concepcion mill was
no longer functioning or was shut down when this
mission was partially secularized and put under the
authority and control of Mission San Jose in 1794
(Cardenas 1983:156; Guerra 1982:38). In spite of
these considerations, I feel that it has been worth
the effort to present tentative explanations for the
questions posed.
Now let me turn to the subject of wheat. My
search of the literature led me to question my
original assumption that wheat was the primary
grain being planted, harvested, and consumed by
the occupants of the San Jose Mission from its
founding throughout its occupation. Although early
18th century descriptions of the San Antonio region
laud its rich soils and irrigation potentials in relation
to the cultivation of wheat (Rivera 1978; Santa Ana
1978; Valdez 1978), it is evidently not until much
later that wheat was actually cultivated in the San
Antonio region. The earliest definite mention of the
cultivation of wheat and barley in the San Antonio
region occurs in four documents dating from 1779.
Two of these documents relate disastrous events:
(1) the loss of a large wheat and barley crop in the
San Antonio region due to a bad storm, and (2) the
Apache Indian destruction of wagons, traveling
from Mexico to the San Antonio area, that contained
seeds to be used for planting wheat and barley
crops (see Gunn [1982:249] as it relates to Watkins
and Gunn [1982:195]). The first of the other two
documents comments on the sowing and harvesting
of wheat, corn, beans, and barley (Croix 1779a),
while the second notes that the local farmers have
no incentive to grow corn or wheat in greater
quantities than they can consume themselves
because they cannot sell the surplus (Croix 1779b).
The earliest definite mention of wheat that I have
found specifically for Mission San Jose is in the
inventory of Governor Munoz ( 1983) in 1794 (this
is the same document where the gristmill is first
mentioned). As noted previously, the trend toward
the cultivation of wheat may well have been a direct
result of the order presented in 1778 by Governor
Domingo Cabell (Morfi 1935:229, 1967:105) and

229

the letter of Teodoro de Croix (1778).
Prior to 1779, the only grain mentioned, and it
is mentioned quite frequently, is corn or maize. It is
mentioned relative to its cultivation and harvesting,
relative to the productivity of the lands or fields,
and relative to the amounts of grain stored in the
mission's bodegas or granaries. After the 1779 reports, wheat is mentioned, albeit infrequently, in all
of the above-mentioned relationships.
Two questions immediately arise from the
above observations: (1) when was corn introduced
to the San Antonio region, and where did it come
from?; and (2) why was wheat not mentioned, and
evidently not grown and harvested, until so late in
the history of the San Antonio region? The answers
to these questions are not readily available and appear to be quite complex. Again, it is likely that
there may well be several interrelated answers to
each question, rather than just one.
At the onset, there seems to be some question
as to whether corn was a mainstay of the subsistence pattern in Central Texas during Prehispanic
times. A brief mention of the presence of
Prehispanic water management technology (i.e., irrigation ditches, with taps or sluices, as well as
terraced fields) appears in the 1709 diary of Fray
Isidoro de Espinosa (Foster 1995:99; Tous 1930:5).
Following the route of travel indicated by the diary,
as well as noting the stated association of the irrigation technology with the San Pedro Springs and its
drainage, San Pedro Creek, which still flows through
the city of San Antonio and joins the San Antonio
River about 575 m southwest of Mission
Concepcion, strongly suggests that the irrigated
fields were within what are now the San Antonio
city limits.
A second mention of the presence of
Prehispanic irrigation in Central Texas is found in
the Fray Pedro de Mezqufa diary of 1718 that documents a portion of the Martin de Alarcon expedition into Texas. This diary notes the area of
irrigation as being near the banks of the San Marcos
River (Hoffmann 1938:319-320), perhaps in the
vicinity of the present Palmetto State Park (Foster
1995:133), somewhat more than 70 km to the eastnortheast of the present San Antonio city limits.
Unfortunately, further details as to the nature
of the water management technology, or the crops
being cultivated and irrigated, were not given by
these two chroniclers. In spite of these failings, it
seems probable, if irrigation agriculture was being

230

Texas Archeological Society

practiced by the Prehispanic occupants of Central
Texas, that com was one of the crops being grown.
However, withstanding the two recorded sightings
of indigenous irrigated agriculture mentioned above,
archeological and other archival sources do not provide support that com was cultivated in the San
Antonio region prior to the arrival of the Spanish
(Fox 1989:29; Fox 1983:21-23; Garant 1989:20;
Garza 1989:24-25, 27; Hester 1989:4; Watkins and
Gunn 1982: 193-196). It is John W. Clark's opinion
(1998 personal communication) that while these
evidences of irrigated agriculture may possibly be
the remains of Jumano subsistence activities, they
more likely represent the works of temporary or
clandestine Spanish or mestizo settlers following
herds of cattle or buffalo into the area as early as
1697 or 1700.
Even if indigenous irrigated agriculture was
not practiced in Central Texas prior to the arrival of
the Spanish, it seems quite likely that the aboriginal
inhabitants knew of corn from their neighbors: the
Pueblo Indians to the west, the Caddo to the north
and east (Fox 1983:24-28), and the Indians of
Mexico to the south. Occasional evidence of this is
suggested by the archeological discovery of a few
cobs of com found in dry Central Texas rockshelters
and caves (e.g., Timmeron Rockshelter [Harris
1985] and the Kyle site [Jelks 1962]). In relation to
the corn grown at the missions, however, it seems
quite possible, but as yet unproved, that it was
brought to Texas from northern Mexico by the Spanish and the Mexican Indians that accompanied them.
One additional observation must be made here:
there evidently were few Spanish females that came
to the New World with the Conquistadores,
therefore, a good deal of intermarriage took place
between the Spanish males and Indian females. The
Mexican Indian females most likely emphasized
Indian cuisine, with its focus on com. This is
reflected in one of the few detailed accounts of
Indian foods that Fox (1989) found with the aid of
Father Marion Habig's search of the mission
documents. Habig and Fox found that both atole
and powle formed mainstays in the mission
Indian's diet. In addition, Gutierrez de la Cueva
(1978:272) comments on the use of pinole in the
San Antonio area in 1791. Although apparently
not mentioned, I would think tortillas, tamales,
esquiate, and yoriki also may well have been part
of the diet (see Pennington [1963: 75-81, 1969:
99-103] for a discussion of all of the above-

mentioned foods and their mode(s) of preparation
in northern Mexico). The main component of all
of these foods is com.
Traditionally, and perhaps functionally as well,
the grinding of the com to the proper consistency
for these foods requires the use of the mano and
metate. Thus, the only proper way to prepare corn
for these foods, in the opinion of the Indians, was
to use the mano and metate. This most likely would
have strongly reinforced the daily use of these tools
in the missions by the Indian converts living there
as well as those working in the mission's kitchens.
There are several references (e.g., Lava 1983a: 17,
1983b:56, l 983c:27), between 1791 and 1793, to
the purchase and shipment of manos and metates to
Mission San Jose and the other missions in the
vicinity that indicates the continuing focus on the
use of corn. Furthermore, between 1794 and 1804
the San Jose documents provide very specific references to the growing and harvesting of com (Munoz
1983:124, 127; Nava 1983:98, 101; Vallejo
1983:235) interspersed with the mention of wheat
(trigo) (e.g., Munoz 1983:128-129, 131; Anonymous 1983: 162), implying the continued importance of corn (as well as manos and metates) even
after wheat became more popular in the area and
the gristmill had been constructed.
The potential answers to the second question
posed above are quite interesting, but as yet somewhat speculative. The reasons why wheat was not
brought from northern Mexico, along with corn,
early in the history of the missions may have been
fourfold:
(1) Wheat in northern Mexico, contrary to my

perception prior to this study, evidently was
not as prevalent as com in agricultural production and the diet. Coming from a completely
different direction in his research, Doolittle
(1991, 1998) has come to the same conclusion.
(2) As noted above, com was a grain known, albeit
perhaps not cultivated, by the Indians of the
San Antonio region, and evidently a very
popular crop and foodstuff in northern Mexico.
The acceptance of com, as opposed to wheat,
as a staple in the Colonial diet in the San
Antonio region is verified by the statement of
the Franciscan Missionary President, Father
Lopez, in his 1789 report of his visit to Texas.
At Mission San Jose he observed that: "Wheat
is not sown, although it does well, because the

Neely -

The Gristmill at Mission San Josey San Miguel de Aguayo

Indians hold it in very low regard in
comparison with corn, which is the daily bread
of this land, and also because its cultivation
would interfere with that of the latter, which is
here considered absolutely necessary for life"
(Lopez 1940:55-56). Note that Father Lopez'
observation is not entirely correct, for, as noted
above, there are at least four documents dating
to 1779 that indicate that wheat was grown in
the area.
(3) The cultivation and consumption emphasis on
corn by the Spanish may well have been to
please the Indians in order to get them to stay
at the missions and thereby facilitate their conversion. Conversely, when the missions became secularized (after 1793), the emphasis on
corn became less and wheat became a greater
part of the diet.
(4) There is a likelihood that wheat was not only a
culturally preferred food for the Spanish, but a
status indicator linked to the diet. That is, persons of higher socio-economic status ate (or
could economically afford to eat) wheat. Therefore, because there were so few individuals of
higher socio-economic status in the San Antonio area prior to the 1790s, the focus was on
corn rather than wheat. As it was not economically worthwhile to cultivate this relatively
fragile grain locally, most of the small amounts
of wheat that were consumed were supplied by
importation from Mexico. The small number
of peninsulares, or even criollos, in Bejar during the early 18th century has been verified by
John W. Clark,jr. (1998 personal communication), lending support to the dominance of the
mestizo, ladino, and Indian foodways in this
area at that time. When more individuals of
higher status moved into the San Antonio area
from Mexico, the increased demand for wheat
was such that it was cultivated and milled in
the San Antonio area. The improvement of
trade, due to better roads, modes of transportation, etc., must also be considered. Such improvements may have affected the growth in
the demand for wheat, not only to meet the
demands of the local inhabitants but, as noted
above, as a potential export to Spain. Although
an interesting possibility, there is yet little data
to verify this hypothesis; it is an idea that must
be investigated in greater detail.

231

Evidently, wheat never really became a popular
grain in Central Texas. In the Province of Texas,
the City of (San Antonio de) Bejar was statistically
censused in 1819 by the Intendancy of San Louis
Potosi. The following is quoted from that document:
" ... The citizenry don't [sic] have other occupations
except agriculture and those who can't do that, hunt
bear and deer. The crops they cultivate consist only
of maize, beans, and some sugar cane, which this
present year have been augmented by wheat"
(Monroy de Martf 1991:8). As late as the 1850s,
Olmsted (1857:133-195) observed the predominance of corn and the sparse cultivation of wheat
in Central Texas. However, he also noted that in
the area of New Braunfels, Texas, the farmers of
German heritage preferred wheat, and were
cultivating it in "considerable" amounts with
"satisfactory success" (Olmsted 1857: 170). For the
most part, the tradition and focus of corn cultivation
and consumption, relative to wheat, predominates
to the present day not only in Central Texas but in
northern Mexico as well (Doolittle 1991:3, 1998).

FINAL OBSERVATIONS
Whatever the immediate and local reasons may
have been, the construction of the gristmill ultimately resulted from a change in grain processing
from a focus on individual or small group consumption and barter to an emphasis on the processing of grain for larger communities and as a
commodity for a market economy. The construction of the gristmill constituted the means to produce wealth and attain power.
My research indicates that there are many
aspects of agricultural production that are not well
studied and are as yet poorly understood for the
Colonial Period of northern Mexico and the northern
frontier of the Spanish Empire. Included in these
failings are details concerning the dietary
preferences and medicinal consumption of
cultivated plants as well as the technology involved
in the processing and preparation of these foodstuffs.
One of the prime reasons for this problem is that it
has been only recently that historical archeology
has dealt with the missions, and Colonial sites in
general, in any other way than as "salvage
archeology." And, of the more recent work, very
few projects have been well-funded, problemoriented studies that have combined the mutually

beneficial research of both archeology and archival
studies. Quite obviously these deficiencies need to
be addressed as future research is planned and
implemented.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
A number of my colleagues contributed their
time and knowledge on specific aspects of this
study. I am especially grateful to William E.
Doolittle, John A. Peterson, Mariah F. Wade, and
Samuel M. Wilson for their encouragement and
many contributions. My thanks also go to Adan
Benevides, David 0. Brown, Karl and Elizabeth

San Jose y San Miguel De Aguayo

ABSTRACT
Numerous small-scale archeological excavations have been carried out at Mission San Josey San Miguel
de Aguayo since its acquisition by the National Park Service. Often, these investigations yielded Native
American artifact collections that were too small for meaningful analysis. This article reports the results of
reanalysis of the available chipped lithic artifacts recovered from Mission San Jose and housed at the Center for
Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Using these results as a starting point, I
present an alternative explanation of the shift from formal bifacial reduction strategies to flake core reduction
and expedient technologies put forth by Parry and Kelly (1987).

INTRODUCTION
The earliest excavations at Mission San Jose
were conducted by Schuetz (1970). Since that time
numerous archeological investigations have been
carried out at the mission, with each effort contributing new and important but small quantities of
materials to the overall collection. By themselves
each of these samples were hardly large enough to
provide a solid basis to characterize the lithic technology of the Indians that occupied the mission. In
addition, because these excavations occurred some
years apart, often different individuals were involved in the analyses and the writing of reports.
Finally, due to the rigors of cultural resource management archaeological schedules, the opportunity
did not seem to exist to combine these small and
disparate samples into a larger whole. This article
has two goals: (1) bring together and analyze all of
the lithic artifacts hitherto excavated from Mission
San Jose, and (2) place the results of the analyses
into the framework of current discussion related to
diachronic changes in lithic technology.

MISSION SAN JOSEY SAN MIGUEL
DE AGUA YO AND ITS HISTORY
Mission San Josey San Miguel de Aguayo was
founded in February 1720 on the east bank of the

San Antonio River "a little more than 3 leagues"
(about 7 miles) south of Mission San Antonio de
Valero (Habig 1978:33; Figure 1). It was to be used
by members of the Pampopa, Pastia, and Suliajame
bands who were apparently at odds with the groups
settled at Valero (Habig 1978:24).
In his 1768 report on the mission, Fray Solfs
lists the following tribes at San Jose: Pampoas,
Mesquites, Pastias, Canamas, Tacames, Canas,
Aguasallas, and Xaunaes (Habig 1978: 159). In
1789, Fray Lopez reports that a group of 31
Barrados, from the coast, had also joined the others
living at the mission (Habig 1978:250). The mission was still at its founding site in the spring of
1721, when Marques de Aguayo visited on his way
to East Texas (Habig 1968a:28-29). However, by
the spring of 1727, when Brigadier General Pedro
de Rivera visited the area, San Jose had been moved
onto a low terrace on the west bank of the river a
little downstream from its first location (Habig
1968a:29, 32-33). This second site was apparently
relatively close to the river bank and subject to
overbank flooding. Due in part to a disastrous smallpox epidemic in 1739, sometime in 1740 the mission was moved yet again, this time to its present
location onto a higher terrace of the river. Habig
(1968a:45) states that this site was about 25 feet
higher and about a half-mile from the second site.
In 1749, when Fray Ignacio Antonio Ciprian
visited the mission, there were 200 resident Indians

The mission ranch (Rancho Atascoso),
which was apparently located 25-30
miles south of the mission, had 1,500
head of cattle, 3,376 sheep, 103 horses,
80 mares, and 30 yoke of oxen (Habig
1968a:52, 56). Since 1749, the ranch
had lost 2,000 head of cattle to hostile
Apaches (Habig 1968a:52) In 1768,
Fray Solis visited the mission for 16
days in August and mentioned 350 Indians living in the mission. Of the 110
warriors, he described 45 as being
armed with guns, and the remaining 65
as having bows and arrows, spears, and
other weapons (Habig 1968a:55-56).
Fray Solis remarked that while the ablebodied men attended to manual labor
the old men made arrows for the warriors (Habig 1968a:57).

Indians. During the 19th century, the population
consisted of local families who had taken up residence in and around the mission. A gradual decline
in use and a lack of interest on the part of San Antonians allowed deterioration of the mission buildings.
After Bexar County obtained title to the various plots of land in the vicinity to create a park, in
1933 the Civil Works Administration (CWA) began the reconstruction of the original south, west,
and east walls of the mission, which had been the
Indian Quarters. On May 8th, 1941, the entire site
had been acquired by the State of Texas, and San
Jose was designated a National Historic Site during
a formal dedication (Habig l 968b: 185-186).
No documentary descriptions have so far been
found that indicate the method of construction or
the exact location of the Indian Quarters during the
first years of San Jose's existence on its present
site. However, it was customary for the first, temporary buildings on a Spanish colonial site to be of
jacal construction, a method that involved setting
upright logs into trenches to form walls, over which
a thatched roof was constructed.
By 1749, Fray Ciprian reported that at least
some of the Indian houses were made of stone
(Habig l 968a:49). Of 84 Indian apartments in 1755,
12 were of stone and consisted of two rooms each.
They were arranged in "streetlike form" (Habig
1978:115). This layout resembles those described
for the earliest years at missions San Juan Capistrano
(Schuetz 1968:33) and San Antonio de Valero (Fox
et al. 1976:3). Governor Barrios in 1758 described
the Indian Quarters as consisting of eight units or
squares of stone with flat roofs and parapets arranged within a larger square (Habig 1968a:5051 ). By the time of the visit of Fray Gaspar de Solis
in 1768, the Indian apartments were stone structures formed as a part of the perimeter walls (Habig
1968a:55). This description was confirmed by Fray
Juan Agustfn Morfi in 1777 (Habig 1968a:68).
After the secularization of the mission in 1794
and the division of the property, the houses of the
Indian Quarters that were unoccupied began to
deteriorate into ruins. Some were replaced by frame
houses as the mid-19th century approached. By the
early 20th century, the mission was the center of a
small settlement composed primarily of the
descendants of the first landowners (Hard et al.
1995:3-8). A 1905 USGS map and an aerial
photograph taken 15 years later indicate small
structures stood along the south, west, and east

De

sides of the compound at that time, most of them of
frame construction. A few traces of the original
walls still existed as ruins.
By the time of the CWA reconstruction of the
mission walls in 1933, the only above ground trace
of the original Indian Quarters visible was a small
section of one apartment at the southwest comer,
visible on aerial photographs but probably hardly
noticeable from ground level (Hard et al. 1995:Figure 5). The foundations of the original walls were
relocated by the CWA workers under the instructions of architect Harvey Smith, and the new walls
were then built upon these foundations. This has
since been confirmed by various archeological excavations and by Anne A. Fox's observations of
small construction projects on the site since 1971.

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
AT THE MISSION
At least nine archeological investigations have
been carried out at Mission San Jose during the
past 30 years. These excavations have sampled
many parts of the mission grounds, including the
central courtyard, areas adjacent to but outside of
the west, east, and south walls, and the acequia
along the north wall of the mission. Unfortunately,
only one of the investigations actually involved
excavations within the Indian Quarters, so that a
smaller proportion of the artifacts discussed here
derive from within the rooms of the Indian Quarters themselves.
The first systematic investigations of the mission were carried out in 1968 by Mardith Schuetz
(1970) of the Witte Museum. This work involved
the monitoring and recovery of artifacts from a
series of sprinkler system trenches within the mission compound and outside and parallel to the south,
west, and north walls. The trenches averaged 30 cm
in depth. Few field notes were taken, and the report consists mostly of lists of artifacts recovered
from each trench and a few brief descriptions of
features encountered.
In 1970, D. Fox (1970) reported several monitoring operations previously carried out as well as
testing he conducted in the vicinity of the north
wall of the mission. Included in this report are
descriptions of monitoring of a large sewer line
trench dug in December 1969 parallel to and north

244

Texas Archeological Society

of the north wall of the mission, and an electrical
line trench dug just north of the church in April
1970. The third section of the report deals with the
excavation in August 1970 of a 2.5 x 3 m unit north
of the church where a persimmon tree was to be
planted. Also mentioned is a drainage trench 30 cm
wide and 40 cm deep dug by workmen for a pipe to
carry water from the church entrance patio to a
drain east of the north wall rooms.
In 1974, Clark (1978) conducted test excavations in a number of locations around the mission
buildings to study the effects of climatic conditions on the major structures. This involved the
excavation of eight test units, generally 1 x 2 m, in
20 cm levels. Clark also summarized the history
and construction of the various buildings at the
mission and provided a detailed plan showing all
disturbances that had occurred and archeological
units that had been excavated at the mission up to
that time.
In 1974, and again in 1976, Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department archeologists conducted excavations in the vicinity of the southwest comer of
the mission, including test trenches inside three
rooms of the Indian Quarters (Roberson and Medlin
1976). These excavations were significant in that
they identified the wall trenches of the earliestjacal
buildings ever constructed at the mission.
In 1979, Clark and Prewitt conducted a testing
operation to the west of the granary in preparation
for the proposed installation of a French drain that
was "intended to relieve moisture-related structural
problems along the west wall of the granary" (Clark
and Prewitt l 979:iii). Six 0.5 x 1 m test pits were
excavated in the affected area. These revealed a
remnant of a flagstone surface and a number of pits
and other disturbances, along with artifactual evidence of Spanish colonial and later uses of the area.
When improvements were planned to Napier
Avenue in 1984, the Texas State Department of
Highways and Public Transportation conducted investigations in the roadbed, locating a number of
features (Henderson and Clark 1984). Among these
were a section of an acequia lateral southeast of the
mission compound, a 19th century burial dug into
the west bank of that feature, and what appeared to
be a Colonial foundation trench ca. 30 m outside
the south wall of the mission. The latter contained a
number of post holes, suggesting that it represented
a corral structure. Colonial and later period artifacts were recovered in the investigations.

In 1991, the Center for Archaeological Research
at The University of Texas at San Antonio (CAR)
conducted archival research and backhoe testing
to locate and map the acequia outside the east
wall of the mission in preparation for the construction of a parking area for a new visitor's
center (Fox and Cox 1991). The exact location of
the acequia madre or main ditch was determined
by excavating two backhoe trenches perpendicular to the suspected path of the acequia and following out the line of the feature based on early
maps of the area. The ditch was found to contain
late 19th century and early 20th century fill. An
acequia lateral first located by Henderson and
Clark (1984) was relocated and mapped by crossing it periodically with backhoe cuts (Fox and
Cox 199l:Figure 3).
CAR conducted test excavations at the southeast gateway and throughout the interior compound
of the mission in 1993 (Hard et al. 1995), and
additional excavations at the gateway in 1996 (Tennis 1997). These investigations revealed the construction of the 19th century road that ran through
the area and the original location of the mission
walls. The testing within the compound yielded
information on the nature and depth of mission
period and later deposits.
The previous excavations that have been most
pertinent to this article were conducted from the
summer of 1997 through the summer of 1998 by
CAR archeologists in the vicinity of the southeast gate of the mission (Tomka and Fox 1998,
1999). Part of the work included excavation of
three 3 x 3 foot units along the outside of the east,
west, and south walls of the mission, and excavations along the southwest comer of the Southeast
gate, along both the inside and outside of the corner. Also included was the excavation of 39 shovel
tests along the outside of the east, west, and south
walls of the mission. These excavations established the stratigraphy of the deposits both inside
and outside the Indian Quarters and mission compound, and identified mission-era cultural materials as much as 15 m outside the south wall of the
mission.
The various excavations by CAR have indicated that in general, deposits between 0-12 inches
deep contain a mix of Colonial and post-Colonial
cultural materials. Deposits from 1.0-1.5 feet appear to be a transition zone characterized by a decreased proportion of post-Colonial materials and

Tomka -

Historic Period Lithic Technology at Mission San Josey San Miguel De Aguayo

an increasing percentage of Colonial materials.
Deeper deposits (l.5-2.5 feet) contain predominantly Colonial materials consisting of large quantities of animal bone, unglazed ceramics (primarily
Goliad wares), and chipped lithic artifacts (Tomka
and Fox 1998, 1999).

LITHIC TECHNOLOGY
AT SANJOSE
The Artifact Samples
The lithic sample utilized for this article consists of all the chipped lithic artifacts from Mission San Jose presently curated at CAR. The
materials include all the specimens from previous
CAR projects, and well as specimens from the
above-mentioned work conducted by Schuetz, Fox,
Clark, and Clark and Prewitt. Many of them from
early excavations are poorly provenienced. In addition, even some of the samples from well-documented contexts are from mixed deposits (e.g.,
0-1.5 feet bs). Nonetheless, two characteristics of
the collection are notable: (1) the almost total
absence of chipped lithic artifacts from pre-Colonial time periods; and (2) the spatial distribution of the samples.
Of the 159 non-debitage chipped lithic artifacts, only three (2 percent) are specimens that are
diagnostic of pre-colonial periods. They include a
Guadalupe adze and two medial dart point fragments. The two dart point fragments were recycled
as gunflints. The Guadalupe adze, which is assumed
to be an Early Archaic tool form (Black and
McGraw 1985), does not exhibit obvious signs of
reworking (e.g., differential patina) but it may nonetheless represent a recycled item. Since it does not
appear that Mission San Jose, at its present location, was built on a prehistoric site, and given the
scarcity of pre-colonial diagnostics in the collection, I assume that the bulk of the chipped lithic
collection-including debitage--derives from the
Colonial occupation of the mission. Given this, and
regardless of the disturbed and poor provenience of
some of the collection, all of the mission specimens
are included in the present analysis.
It is often likely that small samples do not
constitute a representative sample of artifacts from
a site. However, the 760 artifacts reanalyzed for
this study come from a variety of contexts, including

245

outside the east, west, and south walls of the
mission; within the central compound; from a
possible midden deposits adjacent to the southeast
gate; and within structures from Indian Quarter
Rooms 21, 54, and 74. Although it would be
desirable to have a larger sample (n=26) of lithics
from within room contexts, it is possible that the
small sample actually reflects room maintenance
and/or the performance of the majority of the lithic
manufacture and/or maintenance activities outside.
The use of 1/4-inch mesh screening may have
reduced the sample of artifacts recovered from these
contexts, but 50 percent of the matrix from within
two of the four rooms investigated was screened
using 1/8-inch mesh. This procedure did not yield
greater numbers of debitage, but nonetheless, given
the variety of recovery contexts represented, it is
likely that the small collection is representative of
the lithics manufactured and used at the mission
during its occupation by Indian groups.

Results of Analysis
A total of 760 chipped lithic artifacts were recovered during the various investigations at San
Jose (Table 1). They are categorized into the following functional groups: 35 arrow points and arrow point blanks; 18 gunflints; 2 strike-a-lites; 25
scrapers; 1 graver; 9 knives; and 1 Guadalupe adze.
In addition, 42 unifacially flaked artifacts and 11
bifacially flaked item could not be grouped into
functional categories. They are classified as indeterminate uni faces and bifaces, respectively. The
presence/absence of use wear on artifacts was determined using low-powered (80X) micro-wear
analysis. Fifteen flake/blade cores also were recovered, in addition to 601 pieces of unmodified lithic
debitage. Nearly all of artifacts are of fine-grained
chert, most likely obtained from the nearby San
Antonio River.

Arrow Points
A total of 35 arrow points and fragments were
identified in the collection. Of these, 18 are
manufacture-broken or rejected blanks (Figure 2ac ), one is a Guerrero preform, and 16 are finished
specimens of the Guerrero type (Figure 2d-e).
Guerrero points are commonly associated with
mission occupations (Turner and Hester 1993).

The specimens are characterized by triangular to
lanceolate outlines and slightly to moderately
concave bases. It is probable that these points were
manufactured from flake and/or blade blanks rather
than small nodular cores. Ten of the 35 specimens
have been fully bifacially flaked. Of the remaining
25 specimens, 22 are made on flake blanks and
three are made on small blades or bladelets. Of the
16 finished complete or use-broken points, only
seven ( 44 percent) are fully bifacially flaked, while
the remaining nine retain portions of the flake/
blade blank' s ventral surface. This manufacture
strategy is reminiscent of the manufacture of some
Perdiz points.
In general, the seven complete finished specimens are shorter, narrower, and thinner (length=
24.7 Â± 5.7 mm; width=l2.6 Â± 2.0 mm; thickness=
3.4 Â± 0.81 mm) than the seven complete arrow
point blanks (length=34.9 Â± 6.4 mm; width=l 7.7
Â± 5.3 mm; thickness=4.7 Â± 1.0 mm). These differences in size attest to the unfinished nature of
the blanks and the smaller size of the functional
specimens due to reworking.

Gunflints and Strike-a-Lites
Eighteen gunflints (Figure 2f-g) and two strikea-lites (Figure 2h-i) made of local fine-grained
chert and chalcedony were recovered from Mission
San Jose. Of the 18 gunflints, two are made on
recycled dart point medial fragments (Figure 2j-k).
Two others are made on recycled unifaces. The two
dart points are clearly pre-colonial in age. The temporal affiliation of the two reworked unifaces cannot be established, although they may also represent
pre-colonial era artifacts.
The two dart point fragments have use wear
on their bifacially flaked lateral edges. The wear
consists of moderate crushing and step fracturing
beginning in the center of the edge and extending
more heavily onto one face. The flake scar ridges
on the two faces of the medial fragments also
exhibit some rounding and light polish. The two
recycled unifaces have been reflaked into small
rounded to roughly rectangular shapes. They each
have one edge that exhibits the crushing and step
fracturing characteristic of gunflints. In both

Some are fully bifacially flaked
while others are bifacially flaked
only along the margins.
One of the strike-a-lites is a
tertiary blade (see Figure 2h) while
the other is a thick secondary flake
(see Figure 2i). Three of the blade
edges are heavily crushed and step
fractured. The step fracture scars
are deeper and longer and the
crushing more extensive than
noted on the gunflints. The secondary flake has one heavily
crushed and step fractured edge.
Of the 18 gunflints and two strikea-lites, 50 percent are made on
flake blanks, 20 percent are made
on blades, and the nature of the
blank could not be determined on
the other 30 percent.

specimens, the step fracturing extends onto the
flat ventral surface of the uniface.
Sixty-seven percent of the gunflints are rectangular while only six are square or nearly square.

Twenty-five scrapers have been
identified in the collection. Of these,
only four are formal scrapers with
at least one extensi ve1y flaked working edge. One of the four formal
scrapers also has a second working
edge that has only minimal retouch.
Eight (32 percent) scrapers have
working edges created through
minimal retouch. An additional 11
(44 percent) are expedient end or
side scrapers; that is, flakes/blades
used without retouch. The final two
scrapers have two working edges
each, one edge created through
minimal retouch and the other utilized without initial retouch (i.e.,
expedient). Of the 25 scrapers, 14
(56 percent) are made on secondary or tertiary flakes, 10 (40 percent) are made on blades, and the
blank could not be determined on
the remaining specimen.

Graver
A single graver made on a biface thinning flake
was recognized in the collection. It has two engraving

tips along one edge. The edges were alternately
flaked to produce the working tips.

Knives
A total of nine specimens have been identified
as knives based on the minutely scalloped acute
working edge matching macroscopic use-wear derived from cutting or sawing (see Table 1). One of
the nine specimens has a serrated cutting edge (i.e.,
minimal retouch), while the other knives represent
the expedient use of unretouched working edges.
Six of the nine knives are made on blades, and the
remaining three are made on flakes.

Indeterminate Unifaces
The largest artifact category from San Jose consists of indeterminate unifaces (n=42). These include unifacially flaked items that lack use wear or
tool fragments that are too small to be classified
into functional tool categories.
One of the indeterminate unifaces is a small
coarse-grained chert pebble that has been unifacially flaked into a wedge shape. It has a planoconvex cross section, and is entirely corticate on
one face and at one end (see Table 1). Another six
specimens are small unifacially retouched flakes/
blades lacking use wear. The remaining unifacially
flaked fragments are too small to determine whether
they represented end, side, or combination end/side
scrapers. Seventeen of the indeterminate unifaces
are blade fragments, five are flake fragments, one
is a small pebble, and the remaining 19 are too
small to determine the nature of the blank employed in their manufacture.

Indeterminate Bifaces
A total of 11 specimens are included in this
category (see Table 1). Only one of these, a small
pebble with a single bifacially flaked edge, is complete. It resembles a miniature chopper but it is
too light for this purpose. It may have been used
as a small wedge, although no use wear was observed in support of this possibility. The remaining bifaces are manufacture rejects in various
stages of reduction. Six are early reduction failures and two are late reduction stage fragments.
The stage of reduction could not be determined on
two small fragments.

Cores
A total of 15 cores have been recovered to date
from San Jose excavations. Eight of these are large
primary and secondary flakes that were further reduced to produce small expedient tool flake blanks.
Four cores are chert nodules, one of which is considered exhausted based on its size and the number
of flake removal scars present on its surface. The
three final specimens are split pebble cores subsequently used for flake production.

Adze
A single bifacially flaked Guadalupe adze was
recovered. It is a well resharpened use-broken distal fragment. The specimen does not exhibit obvious signs of reworking (e.g., differential patina),
but it may nonetheless represent a recycled item.

Unmodified Debitage
A total of 601 unmodified pieces of lithic
debitage have been found in the mission excavations. The breakdown of cortex categories among
these specimens indicates that tertiary flakes constitute a slightly higher percentage than secondary
flakes (Figure 3). Primary flakes are a small portion
of the collection. However, the combined percentage of primary and secondary debitage is nearly
equal to the percentage of tertiary flakes. The distribution of debitage by size classes indicates that
11-20 mm and 21-30 mm specimens dominate
(Figure 4). The smallest size class (1-10 mm) may
be under-represented primarily because of the 114inch hardware cloth used in screening the bulk of
the matrix.
The distribution of platform facet counts indicates that single faceted flakes are the most
common among the platform-bearing flakes
(complete and proximal fragments, Figure 5).
Importantly, corticate platforms are the second
most common type, further indicating the relative scarcity of flakes with highly prepared platforms. Platform-bearing flakes with two or more
facets represent a relatively small proportion of
the collection. This pattern stands in strong contrast to debitage collections dominated by bifacial
reduction, where multi-faceted striking platforms
greatly outnumber corticate and single faceted
specimens (Tomka 1989).

Finally, the breakdown of the debitage in
terms of flake types indicates that 28 percent
(n=169) of the specimens could not be assigned
to a particular category. An additional two percent (n=12) consisted of angular debris. Core/
platform preparation flakes constitute the largest proportion of the remaining 420 specimens
(Figure 6). Given that, as mentioned before, a
large percentage of the platform-bearing flakes
are single faceted or corticate, and many of the
specimens have blade or bladelet-like morphologies, it is likely that most of these flakes
derive from the preparation of uni- or bidirectional cores rather than bifacial core reductions (e.g., bifaces). Blades and bladelets
constitute the second largest percentage of the
identifiable debitage. Flakes derived from bifacial reduction (e.g., biface manufacture and thinning types) constitute a slightly higher proportion
of the collection than debitage derived from
unifacial reduction (e.g., uniface manufacture
and resharpening). However, neither of these
two reduction strategies are common. The scarcity of biface flakes corresponds to the relative
emphasis on uni- and perhaps bi-directional
blade production at the mission (see also D. Fox
1979:37; Hester 1977a). The scarcity of debitage
derived from uniface manufacture and
resharpening is somewhat surprising given the
apparent emphasis on blade production. It is
possible that some of the blades were used in the
manufacture of tool forms other than unifacial
scrapers. On the other hand, it is also likely that
the debitage resulting from the making of minimally retouched scrapers and the use of expedient scrapers would be relatively small and would
not be recovered in 1/4-inch screening.

of tool forms continue to be used by mission indians
(Hester 1977a, 1989, 1998). The tool and debitage
assemblages also indicate a de-emphasis on the
manufacture of large bifacial tool classes such as
knives (Inman 1997:132-133). While the bifacial
reduction of small arrow points continues, the small
debitage generated during these efforts is absent
from most debitage collections obtained from matrix screened through 114-inch hardware cloth. Combined with the absence ofbifacial reduction debitage
from the manufacture of large bifacial artifacts, the
collection contains large proportions of blades or
blade-like flakes removed in blade manufacture
and blade core preparation. In addition, with the
exception of the arrow points, all other tool classes
are dominated by expediently manufactured and
expediently used forms.
The lack of bifacial reduction debitage and
large bifacial tool classes in combination with the
expedient nature of the tool forms is in general
agreement with patterns noted in many other parts

An Alternative Pe:rspective
on Tool Forms
Parry and Kelly (1987) argue that although
expedient tools and tool kits have some significant advantages over formal ones-including
sharp working edges and lower manufacture
costs-they have high transportation costs. In
contrast, bifacial tools are more expensive to
make, use, and maintain, and are less effective.
Nonetheless, because they are multi-functional
and multi-use implements, bifacial tools have
overall lower transportation costs. Therefore, the
tool kits of highly mobile hunter-gatherers are
dominated by bifacial tools, particularly in raw
material-poor regions. However, in regions with
abundant and ubiquitous raw materials, the lithic
technology should remain relatively expedient
because raw materials will always be available
where needed.

Tomka - Historic Period Lithic Technology at Mission San Josey San Miguel De Aguayo
Parry and Kelly (1987) provide an explanation
for a generalized trend in reduction strategies and
point out that the shift in reduction techniques was
nowhere absolute. Underlying their explanation is
a specific relationship between mobility and tool
form, itself conditioned by raw material availability. In this article, I propose an alternative explanation for variability in tool forms. I suggest that
the choice between formalized versus expedient
tools is conditioned not by mobility, but by the
amount or quantity of labor to be performed in a
given time. Specifically, tool-using contexts that
require the processing of large quantities of resources in a relatively limited time favor the use
of formal hafted tools. On the other hand, tasks
and/or activities that involve the processing of
smaller quantities of resources favor the use of
expedient technologies. Here, expedience and formalization refer to the amount of effort that is
invested in tool manufacture. Standardization, on
the other hand, refers to similarity in manufacture
techniques and processes as well as to a formal
similarity in the final products. To support this
proposition, I discuss the comparative effectiveness and superiority of hafted tools over expedient
tools in the performance of lengthy and repetitive
tasks; review examples of semi-sedentary Late
Prehistoric and Protohistoric groups with tool kits
composed of formalized hafted tools, as well as
Late Prehistoric lithic assemblages rich in bifacial
and unifacial formal tools in a lithic raw materialrich region; and review the prehistoric archeological record to demonstrate the strong correlation
between heavy dependence on bison procurement
and the incidence of bifacially flaked hafted cutting tools and formal hafted unifaces.
Many deer and other medium-sized and small
mammalian species have been butchered by archeologists using replicas of prehistoric tools (Brose
1975; Elliott and Anderson 1974; Hester et al. 1976;
Jones 1980; Odell 1980; Patterson 1975). In general, these experiments indicate that unretouched
flake edges are more effective than bifacially retouched edges, particularly in cutting muscle
(Walker 1978:711). Furthermore, the results of the
experiments suggest that a deer or other mediumsized ungulate can be butchered with as few as one
to three flakes (Odell 1980:43).
While these types of replication studies are
indispensable for understanding the formation of
use wear on stone tools, they cannot accurately

255

replicate the full range of prehistoric tool-using
circumstances. For instance, many of the experiments involve a single or a small number of small
to medium-sized animals. The limitations imposed
by prey size and quantity leave one to question the
applicability of the results to prehistoric contexts
involving a large number of prey or large-bodied
prey. Some of the doubt comes from the fact that a
number of the experimenters report discomfort and
lack of control in using expedient and small bifacial hand-held cutting tools (Jobson 1986:15, 17;
Jones 1980: 153-165; Odell 1980:41; Elliott and
Anderson 1974:5). In contrast, larger tools that
can be more firmly held and better controlled are
more effective than small flake tools held between
the fingers. Similarly, hafted tools allow one to
apply greater leverage, force, and control in the
butchering task and are therefore more effective,
particularly in the performance of lengthy tasks.
For instance, Walker and Long (1977:613) report
that the most comfortable load at which handheld obsidian flake tools could be used was 4 kg,
and as the load increased to the maximum of 7 kg,
the tool became very difficult to control (Walker
and Long 1977:611). On the other hand, hafted
tools (e.g., a steel knife) could be used at loads of
up to 12 kg without affecting tool control. Although prehistoric mastic and/or bindings may not
have been as secure as modern rivets, hafted prehistoric tools should still have allowed greater
loading stresses to be exerted compared to the use
of expedient flakes. I suspect that higher loading
translates into higher cutting/scraping power,
which in turn suggests that the greater efficiency
of expedient flake tools may be overcome by the
use of bifacial hafted tools.
I suggest that the less hand strain and greater
leverage provided by hafted tools translate into significant advantages when the tool user is faced with
the performance of lengthy and/or physically stressful tasks, such as the butchering of large-bodied
animals or a large number of butchering events.
Therefore, while a small number of flakes may be
adequate to butcher a single deer or a small number
of animals, the processing of a large number of
large-bodied prey, such as bison, would be approached not with expedient tools but with formal
bifacially flaked hafted tools. Similarly, while a
rabbit or deer hide may be processed without great
difficulty using a flake, it would be much more
effective and efficient to process a mountain of

256

bison hides obtained during the summer bison hunt
with hafted end scrapers rather than expedient tools.
Parry and Kelly (1987) and Parry (1987) suggest that under decreased or restricted mobility (i.e.,
less frequent and shorter distance movements), the
lithic technology should be dominated by expedient tools. They cite Late Prehistoric Puebloan and
Plains Village groups as examples of the shift from
formal to expedient technologies through time
(Parry and Kelly 1987:289-293). A look at the tool
kits of some Late Prehistoric Puebloan and Plains
Village agriculturalists involved in seasonal bison
procurement provides further insights.
For instance, studies of stable isotope ratios of
the Pecos population (Spielmann et al. 1990) indicate that bison was part of the diet throughout the
site's occupation. Kidder's (1932:196) description
of the presence of bison bone throughout the midden
deposits also support this interpretation. Interestingly, mule deer, rabbits, and antelope made up the
majority of the bone from the middens, and bison
bone was relatively common only in the upper deposits dating to the later part of the 15th century.
Bison bone was also present in the middens of
Gran Quivira National Monument in New Mexico,
a second border pueblo excavated by Hayes et al.
(1981). Here, bison bones appear to increase in
frequency in the late 15th and early 16th century
middens (Spielmann et al. 1990:748). Spielmann
et al. (1990) imply that much, if not all, of the
bison at a number of the eastern-border trading
pueblos derived from trade with hunter-gatherers
of the Plains. This perspective differs from
Kidder's views, who suspected that Puebloan inhabitants were directly involved in bison hunting
along the eastern frontiers.
Excavations at both Pecos and Gran Quivira
pueblos recovered a number of formal hafted tools
most likely associated with bison processing. In
addition to leaf-shaped bifacially flaked specimens
that may have been knives, Kidder (1932:15, 3034) recovered 50 two-edge beveled and 10 fouredge beveled knives. With the possible exception
of two specimens, the majority appear to be made
of Alibates dolomite. All but two of the beveled
knives are from the later deposits (Glaze V and
later, A.D. 1600-1750). Based on the quantity of
debitage of the same material found throughout the
middens, Kidder (1932:31) believed that even
though the knives were of imported raw material,
they were made at Pecos Pueblo. In addition to the

beveled knives, Kidder (1932: 15) also recovered
185 "snub-nosed" end scrapers made of Alibates
dolomite. These specimens are heavily retouched
and well standardized and are morphologically identical to hafted end scrapers used by Plains bison
hunting groups.
Excavations of Mound 7 at Gran Quivira
yielded a similar lithic assemblage. Hayes et al.
(1981:110) identified 54 projectile point that may
have also been knives, seven knives, and 110 unnotched knives. A number of these un-notched
knives are described as long, lanceolate to subrectangular blades with beveled edges (Hayes et al.
1981:110). In addition to the knives, a large number of end scrapers also were recovered (Hayes et
al. 1981: 111 ). Unfortunately, lacking the necessary
use wear analysis, it is not known at present how
many of the 374 so-called "unhafted" unifaces were
actually hafted.
Puebloan peoples who moved onto the western
edge of the Llano Estacado between the l 3-l 6th
centuries also relied on agriculture and seasonal
bison hunting (Pearce 1936; Collins 1968). Lithic
assemblages from Ochoa phase sites on the Llano
Estacado contain arrow points, beveled knives, and
end scrapers (Collins 1968). Late Prehistoric (A.D.
1100-1541) Plains Village groups of the Canadian
and North Canadian river drainages in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle had a similar mixed
economy (Brooks 1989; Habicht-Mauche et al.
1994; Lintz 1986). Typical Antelope Creek phase
(A.D. 1200-1450, see Lintz 1986) and Washita
phase (Bell 1984) tool kits consisted of triangular
arrow points, beveled knives, and standardized
hafted end scrapers (Lintz 1990:Appendix B, n.d.;
Studer 1934).
One of the key factors conditioning the formal properties of tools of mobile hunter-gatherers
is raw material availability. Parry and Kelly (1987)
assume that since bifacial tools represent a strategy that is employed to reduce transportation costs,
few formalized tools should be used, even by
highly mobile groups, in regions where lithic raw
materials are abundant. Therefore, one way to examine the nature of the interrelationship between
mobility and tool form is to investigate the tool
forms used by mobile hunter-gathers in raw material-rich areas.
Many of the Edwards Group Formations of the
Edwards Plateau are rich in high-quality raw materials (Frederick et al. 1994:Figure 1.1; Frederick

Tomka - Historic Period Lithic Technology at Mission San Josey San Miguel De Aguayo
and Ringstaff l 994:Figure 6.2). In addition, both
the eastern margins of the Plateau and the neighboring Blackland Prairie have been prime bison
hunting country for groups beginning about A.D.
1250 and continuing through the Historic period.
The Toyah phase (Prewitt 1981) is one of the wellstudied Late Prehistoric archeological entities most
directly associated with bison hunting in these regions. Although disagreements persist as to the origins of the adaptation and its appearance in Texas
(Black 1986, 1989; Prewitt 1985), it is clear that
between A.D. 1200/1300-1500/1650 (Johnson
1994), human populations were engaged, at least
on a seasonal basis, in bison hunting throughout
much of the Southern Plains and the Blackland
Prairie (Johnson 1994:Figure 105).
An examination of Toyah components from
various sites (41TG91, Creel 1990; 41KM16,
Johnson 1994; 41HI1, Jelks 1962; 41TV42, Suhm
1957; 41JW8, Black 1986; Hester 1977b; 41LK201,
Highley 1986; 41SS20, Green and Hester 1973;
41BX528, Ahr 1998; 41TG346, Quigg and Peck
1995; 41HY209T, Ricklis 1994) indicates that, although not the predominant tool types, most Toyah
components consistently contain two tool forms:
beveled knives (two- or four-beveled) and end
scrapers. These tools are two of the diagnostic elements of bison hunting complexes throughout the
Southern Plains and Central Texas (Creel 1991;
Poteet 1938). Although few of the beveled knives
have been subjected to extensive use-wear analysis, the limited data available indicates that at least
the two-beveled knives were hafted (Shaller et al.
1997). From the limited number of specimens I
have examined, it is my impression that four-beveled knives were also hafted. My microscopic examination of a large number of "snub-nosed" end
scrapers also indicates that Toyah phase end scrapers were hafted. Examples of early historic Plains
hide scraper hafts support this observation (Metcalf
1970; Wedel 1970). Given Parry and Kelly's (1987)
proposed relationship between raw material availability, tool form, and mobility, and since the region is rather rich in lithic raw materials, the
presence of formal bifacial and unifacial tools does
not fit expectations. Formal tools are present in
these collections because they represent the most
effective tool forms employed in bison butchering
and hide processing.
Finally, a look at regional subsistence practices
during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods

257

indicates that hunter-gatherer groups were, to a
greater or lesser extent, engaged in bison procurement during portions of both periods. During the
Late Holocene, bison were present in Central Texas
at two times: (1) 2000 B.C.-A.D. 200, during the
Late Archaic (Collins 1995:Figure 2; Dillehay
1974); and (2) A.D. 1250-1550, during the later
part of the Late Prehistoric (Collins 1995:Figure 2;
Dillehay 1974). In addition, Collins (1995) suggests
that bison also were present in Central Texas in the
Early Archaic period (ca. 4000-3000 B.C.).
I have already described the emphasis of
hunter-gatherers on bison hunting during the Late
Prehistoric period. During the Late Archaic, bison
hunting appears to have flourished between 1000
B.C. and A.D. 100. Archeological sites containing
Marcos, Montell, and Castroville projectile pointsas well as Ensor, Frio, and Fairland types-commonly contain bison bones in addition to the remains
of other ungulates. As in the case of the Late Prehistoric Toyah phase tool assemblage, two tool
forms are consistently present in assemblages containing these point types: bifacial knives and end
scrapers. Unlike any preceding time in prehistory,
the manufacture and use of specialized hafted bifacial knives appears to have flourished during the
Late Archaic. A number of bifacial knives make
their appearance, including comer-tang knives,
"short-stemmed" knives, and San Gabriel bifaces.
The comer-tang bifaces tend to occur in sites
with Castroville, Marcos, Montell, Ensor, and Frio
points (Saner and Tomka 1998). In Central Texas,
they appear to be distributed on the eastern margins
of the Edwards Plateau and along the Blackland
Prairie (Patterson 1936:Figure 3). Their distribution extends outside of Texas and follows the Central Plains region (Kraft 1994:Figure 7). It has been
suggested that these tools may not have been hafted
(McReynolds 1984). An examination of a number
of specimens from the Edwards Plateau indicates
clear haft wear, sometimes in combination with
probable mastic residue, on all but the manufacture-broken specimens (Saner and Tomka 1998).
A second bifacial knife found on Late Archaic
sites is large triangular bifaces with short stems
(Hester 1995; Hester and Green 1972). Like the
comer-tang knives, wear analysis of these specimens shows that they were used as hafted knives
(Hester and Green 1972:345). These hafted knives,
and other large well-made and very thin triangular
bifaces, are consistently found in Late Archaic sites

258

Texas Archeological Society

(Hester 1995). Although the triangular haftless
specimens may represent "trade blanks" (Hester
and Barber 1990), some of the specimens exhibit
considerable use wear, such as the heavily edgepolished specimen recovered from a Late Archaic
burial in Wilson County, Texas (Labadie 1988).
Although use wear analyses on these specimens
have not been performed, it is suggested that the
degree of wear exhibited by many of these triangular specimens would have developed only if these
knives were hafted while in use. Finally, while these
specimens are found primarily in South and south
central Texas, an additional triangular form, the
San Gabriel biface (Prewitt 1982), was their equivalent in Central Texas during the Late Archaic. These
triangular and well-thinned bifaces co-occur with
Late Archaic Ensor points, and although use wear
analyses have not been completed, they appear to
be finished tool forms rather than preforms.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Bifacial knives and hafted end scrapers tend to
be associated with periods of bison presence in
Central Texas. However, these examples were highlighted simply because they are the most clear cut.
That is, the manufacture and use of bifacial hafted
knives is not assumed to be necessarily restricted to
periods of bison presence. Rather, it is suggested
that formalized and standardized hafted tool forms
would be consistently manufactured and used at
any time the resources procured were sufficiently
large to necessitate more efficient processing technologies than could be obtained by expedient flake
tools. This situational relationship between tool form
and amount of labor can easily account for the
presence of both formal standardized hafted tools
and their expedient functional equivalents on many
sites. This co-occurence should not necessarily be
taken as participation in on-site tasks. On the other
hand, there is no particular reason why they could
not have been employed in different tasks. Expedient tools are more than adequate in the performance of many domestic and maintenance tasks
carried out at residential camps. However, certain
tasks may require greater strength/leverage or better control of the tool, and in these circumstances
hafted tools would be most effective and desirable.
Having provided the broad theoretical outlines of an alternative to Parry and Kelly's (1987)

relationship between tool form and mobility, what
does this have to do with mission lithic assemblages? Previously, formal variability in tool kits
and assemblages tended to be interpreted as signaling variability in mobility strategies. If, however,
tool form is conditioned by the amount of work that
is to be performed, it may be possible to use the
ratio of formal to expedient tools in an assemblage to gauge the proportion of bulk resource
procurement and processing activities engaged in
by prehistoric or historic Native groups. Such a
relationship places the variability in mission lithic
assemblages in a new light by allowing the exploration of which groups were more or less dependent on mission resources as opposed to wild
resources, and more precisely determining the degree to which wild resources were procured in small
packages dispersed over time, or as large packages
or quantity obtained in a short episode.
Using this approach, it is likely that the Indian
population from Mission San Jose was to a large
part dependent on the animal resources of the mission rather than hunted resources. This impression
is in part confirmed by the account that of the seven
cows slaughtered each week at the mission, four
were designated for consumption by those living
within the compound (Habig 1968a:52). A similar
pattern appears to be evident from Mission Refugio,
where preliminary indications are that much of the
lithic technology was also expedient in nature and
dominated by blade core rather than bifacial reduction strategies. The large size of most of the cow
bones recovered from Refugio may be an indication of sufficient meat for mission consumption to
reduce the need for systematic hunting of wild resources. The same pattern appears to hold for the
lithic assemblage from the Alamo (see Lohse, this
volume). The non-debitage artifact types recovered from the Alamo are not unlike those from
Mission San Jose. Interestingly, however, about
nine percent of the relatively sizable unmodified
lithic debitage collection from the Alamo consists of biface thinning flakes. This percentage is
much higher than the two percent recovered from
Mission San Jose. However, 33 flakes have been
identified as representing biface manufacture
(e.g., early and middle reduction stage, thinning,
and resharpening) in the San Jose collection. This
number represents eight percent of the identifiable flake types (n=420, excluding angular debris and indeterminate specimens). Overall, then,

Tomka - Historic Period Lithic Technology at Mission San Josey San Miguel De Aguayo
little difference appears to exist between the three
mission assemblages. The chipped lithic assemblages from Mission San Jose and Refugio are
primarily expedient in nature, suggesting yet again
that there was little need for highly formalized
tool kits because the resident Indian population
depended primarily on the missions' livestock for
meat protein.

Analysis of Materials from 1979
Excavations at the Alamo
Jon C. Lohse

ABSTRACT

A lithic assemblage collected during excavations conducted at the west wall of the Alamo mission complex
in San Antonio is analyzed in this paper. Much of the collection was associated with a bone midden, and
represents Native American subsistence activities in a European context. Interpretations are offered according
to the results of the analysis, as are suggestions for future directions in analyses of lithics from mission studies
in South Texas and Northern Mexico.

INTRODUCTION
While fascination with Texas' archeological
past has always been strong, interest in the legacy
of the Colonial era in particular has enjoyed a recent surge. During that time, the Indians of Southern Texas and Northern Mexico experienced a
disruption in their native lifeways as they endured a
dramatic increase in European, and especially Spanish, contact and interaction. The experiences of Native American groups ranged from adjustments to
new neighbors to outright relocation, sometimes
into the setting of a mission. In either case, this was
the beginning of a long era of gradual disenfranchisement, as first Europeans and then AngloAmericans pushed into the "unsettled" frontier. The
manner and degree to which the many Native
American groups adapted to a new way of life,
either within the walls of a particular mission or
away from their traditional homelands, is still poorly
understood. Recent archeological (e.g., Inman 1997;
Ricklis 1998; Walter 1997) and ethnohistorical
(Salinas 1990) work across Southern Texas and
Northern Mexico (Figure 1), though, is shedding
light on the beginnings of this protracted cultural
diaspora and its long-term effects.
This paper examines a collection of lithic artifacts recovered during excavations conducted by
the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1979 at
the Mission San Antonio de Valero, also known as

or negative bulbs of percussion). The difference
between chips and chunks is, admittedly, somewhat subjective, although both categories may be
the result of opportunistic lithic resource collection
and exploitation strategies focused on medium-sized
cobbles found either on the surface or in river channels near the mission.
This morpho-technological system of debitage
classification is consistent with that used previously
by Fox (1979). In his analysis of lithics from other
mission contexts, Fox (1979:9) notes that "the morphologically defined categories may be representative of products (chipped stone specimens that
functioned as tools) and by-products (chipping debris and other lithic forms which became detached
from the continuum) of lithic tool production."
Non-debitage stone artifacts were also identified
and placed into categories. These include formal
tools; trimmed or retouched unifacial flake tools; a
single hammerstone; and flake cores, some of which
also appear from wear patterns to have been used
as chopper-like implements. Formal tools include
scrapers, of both end and side varieties; arrow
points; prismatic or ridge blades, some of which
show distinct macroscopic wear patterns along their
lateral edges; and an Archaic period Guadalupe
tool (cf. Turner and Hester 1993:256-260) that was
apparently carried into the site (Thomas R. Hester,
1990 personal communication).
This collection includes a relatively large number (n=l5) of gunflints, which are also classified as
formal tools. These artifacts are present in other
historic era assemblages from Mission San Bernardo

267

and perhaps Mission San Bautista in Northern
Mexico (Inman 1997:43, 70-71); Espiritu Santo (final location) and Nuestra Senora del Rosario in
Goliad County (Mounger 1959; Inman 1997:Table
19; Ricklis 1998:Tables 1 and 4); San Lorenzo de
la Cruz in Real County (Tunnell and Newcomb
1969); and Missions San Jose (Hard et al. 1995),
San Juan Capistrano, and Concepcion (Fox
1979:Figure 11 and Table 2) in San Antonio.
Gunflints have been reported from other locations
within the Alamo mission complex as well (e.g.,
Fox et al. 1976:73 and Figure 26i; Fox 1979:Table
2). Analytical categories defined in this analysis
are depicted in Figure 3, and Table 1 shows the
breakdown of the 1979 assemblage by artifact type
and frequency.
THE ASSEMBLAGE
Dehitage
By far the largest analytical category of this
assemblage is unmodified debitage. Of the 2,078
pieces included in this collection, a total of 2,009
are debitage (Table 2). It is important to note that
a number of debitage specimens, while unmodified, did show macroscopic edge damage. Utilized
flakes and flake fragments form an integral part of
many Native American tool kits, and generally
should be included in comprehensive lithic
analyses. However, because of the long-term
storage of this collection, it was not considered
well suited to a detailed use wear analysis, and so

Artifacts

Among the 69 artifacts in this category are
completed formal tools, informal bifaces and
unifaces, flake cores, choppers, and a hammer-stone.
In some cases these artifacts (especially formal
tools) represent the finished product of a deliberate
reduction sequence, and belong to recognizable
types that are found in other mission and non-mission contexts. Other artifacts-such as flake cores
and the hammerstone-are included here because

These tools were made on flakes or blades,
occasionally show cortex, and may have been used
for scraping or cutting activities in the processing
of plant and animal remains (Figure 6). There are
11 specimens in this collection (a 12th was removed earlier and is not included in this analysis).
Among the scrapers, 82 percent show either macroscopic edge damage on the distal end or on their
lateral edges, and 73 percent were used on both the
end and edges. Edge angles range between 55-116Â°
(Table 4).
Of interest regarding the scrapers is that at least
three (specimens A/C-4, 12-3, and 39-BB-4) appear
to have been made on blades. Blade technology is a

from Europe, most likely France (Thomas R. Hester,
1998 personal communication). Gunflints of both
Native American and European manufacture have
been reported from numerous other missions (cf.
Fox 1979; Hester n.d.; Inman 1997; Tunnell and
Newcomb 1969; Walter 1997). Manufacturing
techniques for gunflints vary, with specimens
showing unifacial, bifacial, and alternate-edge
beveled flaking. Many retain intact striking
platforms and bulbs of percussion, indicating that
they were crafted from interior flakes, while others
were made of pre-existing bifaces.
Kenmotsu (1990) conducted a study of historic
and replicated gunflints, and determined that they
derive from three possible sources, depending on
material type and techniques of manufacture.

defining characteristic of Toyah horizon lithic
industries (Black 1989), and is also common in
mission assemblages (Hester 1989).

Gunflints
A total of 15 chipped stone artifacts were
recovered from the Alamo excavations that were
recognized as gunflints. These artifacts may be
produced through a variety of techniques, and
specimens include those made by Native American
occupants of the mission as well as those imported

Gunflints from France are common in assemblages,
and may be identified by material of a "honeyyellow or blond" color. English-made gunflints generally appear in archeological sites dating after 1790,
and are characterized by "very dark, nearly black,
translucent flint to a gray, opaque flint with inclusions" (Kenmotsu 1990:95-96). European gunflints
were mass-produced using a technique by which a
macro-blade would be manufactured, then broken
into regular-sized fragments. These would then be
unifacially trimmed around the edges to create the
final tool form. This "snap-blade" technique results
in a fairly standardized tool size, and may be recognized through the presence of blade ridges, or arises,
along the dorsal side of the artifact (Kenmotsu
1990). Gunflints of Native American manufacture
are frequently more standardized in form, "with all

four edges carefully worked to an edge by secondary chipping" (Witthoft 1966:22, as cited in
Kenmotsu 1990:97). These may be made of a wider
variety of material types, depending on what is
locally available, and frequently they show bifacial
edge modification.
The gunflints recovered from the 1979 excavations range in size from 3.71 x 3.62 cm (specimen
59-7) to 2.04 x 1.55 cm (specimen 73-5) (Figure 7
and Table 5). Differences in size may reflect the
type of weapon in which the gunflint was used
(such as a musket or pistol, Thomas R. Hester,
1998 personal communication), and the Radio
Shack gunflints have been separated into three informal size gradients that reflect these differences.
The largest size grouping includes specimens 59-7
and 7-1, while the second group (n=4) includes

The four specimens in this category have been
worked on both sides in order to create an edge
suited for utilitarian tasks. One of the bifaces (specimen 70-7) appears to be the distal tip of a dart
point, while the others represent fragments of indeterminable origin (see Figure 8). Metric dimensions for bifaces are provided in Table 7.

width" (Crabtree 1982: 16). This technology is designed to achieve a long, fairly straight cutting edge,
and also results in a high ratio of cutting edge-toflake mass. The skill necessary to prepare a platform, the uniform dimensions of these artifacts,
and the fact that they represent such a small percentage (0.3 percent) of the overall collection suggest that blade technology represents at least a low
level of specialized skill among the mission Indians
at the Alamo.

This specimen is a Guadalupe tool as defined
by Turner and Hester (1993:256-260), and clearly
dates to the Early Archaic period. Heavy patination
on this specimen, and its presence out of primary
temporal context, suggests that it was transported
into the mission site. However, there is light retouch along its edges, and so it appears to have
undergone at least some use in its present context.
Metric dimensions for the Guadalupe tool are provided in Table 8.

(Table 9). Both appear to have been heavily modified, but the purpose for which they were intended
is unclear. One specimen (47-BB-3) is simply a
flake that was unifacially trimmed to provide two
distinct working edges. These artifacts do not resemble formal tool types recognized elsewhere in
Texas during this time period, and likely represent
heavily but expediently utilized flakes that underwent some degree of tool modification.

Hammerstones, Choppers, and Cores
A total of six specimens from these three classes
were included in this collection. These tool types
are presented together here because several of these
specimens show multiple wear patterns, suggesting
that they do not easily conform to a single artifact
type. Flake cores are relatively easy to recognize;
they show evidence of prepared platform areas, and
perhaps negative bulbs of percussion that relate
morphologically to the ventral sides of the flakes
removed. However, the technique of bifacial flake
removal may also produce a rough edge useful for
certain tasks. Observed wear in the form of battered
and crushed edges implies use of these artifacts as
chopper-like implements. The core-chopper continuum has been described previously for the San
Antonio missions (Fox 1979) and elsewhere (e.g.,
Aoyama 1994) and appears to have been commonplace in the pre-Columbian New World.
In addition to the three core-chopper tools, one
specimen (specimen 35-2) appears to have served
as a core and a hammerstone as well (Figure 9).
Weights in grams, and comments, are provided for
hammerstones, cores, and choppers in Table 10,
and Figure 10 is a hammers tone recovered during
the excavations.

DISCUSSION OF EXCA VATE:O
CONTEXT FOR 1979
ASSEMBLAGE
As mentioned earlier, the lithic assemblage
described in this article was collected from deposits
immediately outside the west Alamo wall.
Construction of a commercial building in the late
1800s protected these deposits from disturbance
(J. Ivey, field notes on file at the Center for
Archaeological Research, The University of Texas
at San Antonio). During the field work, excavators
recorded a midden of fauna! material located
behind what was the outer wall of the neophyte
residential area. Figure 11 shows the excavation
units and the location of the bone midden, as well
as an adobe wall remnant that indicates the former
location of Native American occupation areas
within the mission. The midden assemblage
consists of larger fauna such as goat, sheep, and
cattle (Anne Fox, 1991 personal communication),
and the kinds of lithic artifacts found in association
with this midden provide an indication of the

subsistence practices of the neophytes in an
otherwise European cultural context.
The artifacts directly associated with the bone
midden represent only a small percentage of those
recovered during the 1979 excavations. By no
means do they reflect the total range of lithic
production behavior that took place at this site.
Further, many of the artifacts not found in
association with the midden are also likely to
represent important tools used in daily subsistence.
However, the information provided in Table 11
does allow some tentative conclusions concerning

the degree to which Native American lithic
industries were employed in a European mission
setting.
First, the low ratio of gunflints present implies a
continued reliance on traditional arrow points for
hunting. Many of the gunflints recovered during these
excavations may have been deposited during the 1836
Battle of the Alamo, rather than during the mission
occupation (Thomas R. Hester, 1998 personal communication). This conclusion is supported somewhat
by the relatively high proportions (35 percent) of
arrow points in the bone midden (see Table 11).
The general prevalence of Native American
arrow points, especially the Perdiz style point made
of glass, in addition to the frequency of side and
end scrapers in the midden, is also indicative of the
retention of traditional technologies over newly
available European materials. Some archeologists
(e.g., Ricklis 1998) have suggested that Native
American mission occupants may have incorporated
metal implements into their toolkits rather than
traditional tool forms; the present analysis would
seem to imply that the adoption of new technologies
may not have been universal. Stronger support for
this interpretation may come from future studies of
microscopic use wear on blade tools, scrapers, and
expediently utilized debitage.
Finally, the relatively low frequency of
prismatic blades (14 percent) found with this midden
would seem to imply that these tools may not have
been integral to the processing of large fauna. No
evidence is currently available to refute this
impression. However, future studies of mission
assemblages should include microscopic use wear
studies of both formal tools (such as prismatic

blades) and expediently used debitage. These studies
may identify shifting trends in subsistence behavior
in light of the introduction of new materials and
resources into Native American toolkits during the
mission era, as well as potential changes in
subsistence resources that were available.

DISCUSSION AND
CONCLUSIONS
The lithic artifacts recovered during 1979 excavations at the Mission San Antonio de Valero
represent an important aspect of mission studies
across Southern Texas and Northern Mexico. They
illustrate important patterns that existed within Native American mission lithic assemblages, and can
help in documenting changes in subsistence behavior through regional comparisons across Southern
Texas and Northern Mexico (see Inman, and Tomka,
this volume). Such comparisons of mission assemblages may help our understanding of the success
or failure of the Spanish advance during the Colonial era.
Through the current analysis, certain fundamental traits can be used to characterize mission
Iithic industries. These include the Guerrero arrow
point type, prismatic blade technology, formal end
and side scrapers that are frequently made on prismatic blades, gunflints, and in some cases the presence of core-chopper tools (cf. Hester [1989, n.d.]
for discussions of mission lithic toolkits). Many of
these traits also characterize Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric, non-mission occupations belonging
to the Toyah horizon (Black 1986, 1989; Hester
1977, 1989, 1995; Hester and Hill 1975; Ricklis
1992) and the Rockport phase (Hester and Shafer
1976; Ricklis 1992, 1998). Artifacts diagnostic of
these earlier time periods include beveled knives,
Perdiz points, bone-tempered ceramics, the reintroduction of blade technology, and drills and perforators made on flakes (Black 1989; Ricklis 1998: 109).
Artifact types found in missions such as prismatic
blades, scrapers, and especially the Perdiz point
provide strong evidence of cultural continuity from
the Protohistoric into the Historic period.
In the current assemblage, as well as in others
available for comparison (e.g., Fox 1979; Inman
1997; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969; Walter 1997),
there is evidence of earlier, Archaic material mixed
in with the Historic era collections. In many cases,

these artifacts appear to have been curated into
mission settings, and several have clearly undergone reuse. Two general implications may be
drawn from this behavior. As no Archaic period
sites have been reported to underlie the missions,
neophyte groups occupying Spanish colonial missions may have been allowed to come and go with
relative impunity. Ricklis (1996) has demonstrated
how this freedom of movement for the Karankawa
Indians of the Gulf Coast allowed them to incorporate nearby Spanish missions into their seasonal
subsistence procurement schedule. Also, the preference for chipped stone tools, even those gathered from outside the mission context, may provide
another line of evidence against the ready acceptance of European metal implements. These two
points argue for the complexity of the relationship
between European missionaries and their contemporary Native American neighbors.
Important differences between mission
assemblages and those of the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods seem to focus on the shift
from Perdiz to Guerrero arrow points, and the
presence of gunflints. However, changes are also
evident that suggest a closer look is warranted at
mission lithic assemblages. As one moves south
from the San Antonio missions into Mexico, the
frequencies of Guerrero points (cf. Inman 1997;
Mounger 1959; Ricklis 1998) show a demonstrable
percentage increase in the assemblages. The rapid
spread of this style, then, may perhaps be understood

either as a sub-regional response to changes in the
subsistence base, or to the presence of Native
American styles that predominated in Northern
Mexico, and that were able to spread into South
Texas along with Spanish influences.
The relatively low frequency of formal end
and side scrapers in certain missions has been
explained by the introduction of functionally
equivalent tools made of metal (Ricklis 1998).
The strong association between stone scrapers and
large faunal remains found during the 1979 Alamo
excavations provides an opportunity to reevaluate
this conclusion. To explain the relative frequency
of these tools in other mission assemblages, one
could instead examine how populations of bison
and other large fauna were affected during this
era, or their representation in midden deposits
associated with mission neophyte residential areas,
as in the Radio Shack excavations near the west
wall of the Alamo.
An additional line of evidence supporting a
changing subsistence base is the continuity of prismatic blade technology in some missions. Thus,
while formal scrapers were particularly well-suited
for processing the bison that inhabited the corridor
to the east of the Edwards Plateau (cf. Dillehay
1974), these tools are absent at certain sites. However, the continued use of prismatic blade technology in these same assemblages (e.g., Ricklis 1998)
seems to argue for a shift away from large game as
an important resource.

278

Texas Archeological Society

Finally, the presence of a core-chopper continuum may be diagnostic of a toolkit based largely
on expediently used flakes and flake fragments,
thus accounting for the relatively low frequency
of formal tools in the Alamo collection discussed
here. This pattern pervades domestic toolkits further south in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica
(Aoyama 1994; Lohse n.d.). Implications from this
observation are (1) that wear patterns on debitage
may provide significant information concerning
the resources that would have provided important
dietary supplements or staples, and (2) that microscopic use wear studies should comprise an integral part of future analyses of mission lithic
assemblages.
The Radio Shack collection from Mission San
Antonio de Valero has provided an excellent opportunity to examine lithic industries employed
by Native Americans in Europeanized contexts.
Given the patterns evident is this collection, additional work is warranted in other mission locations throughout Southern Texas and Northern
Mexico to determine if the trends suggested here
are accurate, because they hold important implications for understanding the acculturation of Native American groups during their protracted
diaspora in the Spanish Colonial era.

Analysis of Vertebrate Faunal Remains from a Spanish
Colonial Deposit at Mission San Antonio
de Valero (the Alamo)
Barbara A. Meissner

ABSTRACT
In 1979, the Center for Archaeological Research, University of Texas at San Antonio, completed
excavations beneath the floor of a building constructed in 1875 on the west side of Alamo Plaza, in downtown
San Antonio, Texas. The building had been constructed over the remains of the west wall of Mission San Antonio
de Valero, the first of five Spanish missions in the area. Placement of the building had preserved a well-stratified
deposit of 18th and 19th century artifacts. During the excavations, a large undisturbed Spanish colonial period
bone bed was discovered, comprised of more than 12,000 bones in excellent condition. This article will report
the results of a recent analysis of the contents of this bone bed.

INTRODUCTION
In July 1979, the Center for Archaeological
Research (CAR), of the University of Texas at San
Antonio, began excavations inside a building that
had been built over the remains of a portion of the
west wall of Mission San Antonio de Valero
(41BX6; Figure 1). This mission, the first of five
Spanish missions along the upper San Antonio
River, later became known as the Alamo (Figure
2), and was the site of a world-famous battle during
the 1836 Texas Revolution.
The excavations were part of a project to link
the city's two most popular tourist attractions:
Alamo Plaza and the Riverwalk. The project involved tearing down several buildings along the
southern part of the west side of Alamo Plaza to
create a park-like link to the Riverwalk, known as
the Paseo del Alamo. The building to be excavated
had most recently housed a Radio Shack store. It
was important because it was the only building
along the west side of the plaza that did not have a
basement. Originally built around 1870, the building was believed to straddle part of the west wall of
Mission San Antonio de Valero (Figure 3). It was
considered possible that the building had unintentionally served as a protective barrier over almost
300 years of cultural remains. Although the area

was known to have once been part of Mission San
Antonio, the building was given a different site
number, 41BX438.
Excavations, directed by Jake Ivey, proved that
the building did indeed hide a rich deposit of artifacts, ranging in age from the Spanish Colonial
period to the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
including evidence of the battle in 1836 that had
made the old mission world-famous (I. W. Cox,
1996 personal communication). The west wall of
the mission, constructed of adobe, was discovered
during the excavation. Outside this was a small
depression, apparently an arroyo, filled with bone
and other refuse, beginning about 2 feet below the
original ground surface (Figure 4). When excavation of this feature was complete, a small silver
coin was discovered directly beneath the lowest
level of bone. It was identified as a 1 real piece,
minted in Mexico City in 1748 (Figure 5), conveniently providing a terminus post quem for the bone
bed date.
The results of the Radio Shack excavations
were not published. The bone from the bone bed
remained in storage at the CAR curation facility
for about 16 years. In 1996, I began an analysis of
the bone from the bone bed for a Master's Thesis
(Meissner 1998a). This article will present a
summary of the results of that analysis, and will

Pedro Springs (de la Teja
1995:8; John 1975:206-207).
The location, at the border between the dry lands of what is
now southwest Texas and northern Mexico and the relatively
wet lands of East Texas, was
highly strategic. A mission,
presidio, and civilian community
were established near the head
of the San Antonio River to provide a secure way-station between the Rio Grande and the
East Texas missions (Habig
1968:38). Together these three
communities formed the nucleus
that would become San Antonio, Texas.
Sometime before January
1719, the mission site was
moved to the east side of the
river, south of the present location, near where Commerce
Street crosses the river today
(Cox 1994:1). By 1721, 240 Indians were living at the mission.
However, in 1724, a hurricane
devastated the mission buildings,
and it was moved to its present
location (Habig 1968:43).

consider how those results can
help to reconstruct the lifeways of the people who left
the bone there.

In 1745, work began on a permanent stone
church for the mission. Fray Lopez reported in
1789 that the building had once been completed,
but had shortly afterwards collapsed. The rebuilding had been completed to the height of the cornices, but "at this point construction stopped many
years ago for lack of qualified workmen. For this
and other reasons .. .it cannot now be carried to
completion" (Habig 1968:64-65). By this time,
the mission was clearly failing, with only 52 Native Americans in residence (Habig 1968:65). In
1793, a royal decree secularized Mission San Antonio de Valero, and the mission lands were divided among the remaining mission inhabitants
and other local citizens.

Beginning in 1803, the old
mission grounds served as a garrison of the Spanish Army
through years of revolutionary
turmoil, which did not end even
after Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821. In December 1835, the garrison was
captured by Texans seeking independence from Mexico. For 13
days in February and March of
the next year, the grounds were
held by about 200 men against
an army of Mexican soldiers. The
siege ended on March 6th, when
the Mexican Army overwhelmed
the old mission and killed all the defenders
(Fehrenbach 1968:185-215). In the aftermath of that
war the mission grounds were left in ruins (Cox
1994:7-9).
After a decade of existence as an independent
nation, Texas was annexed by the United States.
In 1849, the U.S. Army leased the Alamo church
and convento from the Catholic church, and began
restoring some of the buildings for use as a
Quartermaster's Corps depot (Cox 1994:12). There
was some question whether the old church should
be torn down or repaired; the latter course was
taken, not out of respect for its antecedents but as
an economy measure (Young 1991:5).
By 1850, the army had repaired the old
convento building, built a number of small outbuildings in the old convento patio, put a roof
on the old church (its first successful covering
after more than a hundred years of existence),
and put a cap over the original facade of the
building. It is this cap that forms the most
famous architectural outline in Texas.
The presence of the army depot increased
traffic around Alamo Plaza enormously. In
1876 the army moved out of the Alamo and
into the new facilities at Fort Sam Houston
(Story 1938:45). The main post office was
moved to Alamo Plaza in 1877 (Cox 1994:22).
The old convento was being used as a general
store, while the church building, which was
leased from the Catholic Church, served as the

Meissner-Analysis of Vertebrate Faunal Remains from a Spanish Colonial Deposit 285
store's warehouse until 1883, when the Texas State
Legislature decided that the Alamo church should
be purchased by the state. The city of San Antonio
agreed to assume upkeep of the building, a responsibility that was later given to the Daughters
of the Republic of Texas (Story 1938:54).
Throughout the late 19th century Alamo Plaza
continued to develop as an urban center. In the
1880s, the Crockett Block was built along the
west side of the plaza, and in 1886 the Grand
Opera House was built (Cox 1994:23). The small
store between these imposing structures had been
built around 1870, and expanded in 1880 (Fox and
Ivey 1979); it was in use as a barber shop in 1877
(Meissner 1998a:21). According to the 1923-1927
Sanborn insurance map, the small building was
being used as a clothing store, while other buildings along that side of the street were also used for
commercial purposes.
During the years before World War II, the
park in Alamo Plaza underwent numerous changes
(Cox 1994:30). For the centennial of the Battle of
the Alamo, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas,
with state and federal aid, completely renovated
the Alamo grounds, put a new roof on the church,
and built the Museum/Gift Shop. The Cenotaph
memorial was constructed in 1940 (Cox 1994:33).
At about the same time, plans to make a commercial and tourist attraction out of the riverbank in
downtown San Antonio were made, and the early
stages carried out. However, the beginning of
World War II cut off further development of the
area, and it was not until the mid-1960s that the
Riverwalk was once again set for development
(Cox 1994:33). A decade later the plaza was redesigned again. An outline of the "Low Barracks"
was reconstructed on the foundations, and used as
a flower box (Cox 1994:33; Fox et al. 1976; see
Figure 3). The next major change in the structure
of the plaza was the Alamo-River Linkage Project,
begun in 1979.
Alamo Plaza began as the compound of a
mission, became an unsuccessful fortress, lay
deserted for a time, and then became one of the
major commercial centers of a growing city.
Today it functions as a tourist center, and home
of numerous commercial enterprises, but also
serves as a monument to those who died in the
famous battle, and as a reminder of the long
history of San Antonio.

METHODS
Field Methodology
As mentioned above, the 1979 excavation took
place inside a building that had most recently housed
a Radio Shack store. With the cooperation of the
city, lights and air-conditioning were available.
Once the floor and support beams had been recorded and removed, the excavation grid was established (Figure 6). The units were 4 x 4 feet in
size, and were numbered consecutively from the
northwest comer of the building (Ivey 1989). After
the interior excavations were complete, the building was torn down and debris removed. The remains of the west wall were protected, and can be
seen today, still in situ, inside a display case at the
entrance of the Paseo del Alamo.
The units were excavated in a checkerboard
pattern in order to allow profiles to be made of all
four walls of each unit. Sixty-five units were excavated during the project. The bone bed was found
first in Unit 43, at a depth of approximately 2 feet
below the ground surface. As the number, size, and
condition of bone was recognized, the decision was
made to number each bone before it was removed.
After Unit 43 had reached sterile sediments, adjacent units were excavated down to the level of the
bone bed. Only when the extent of the bone bed had
been determined was the first layer of bone in the
other units removed. All in situ bones visible in a
layer were numbered in black India ink (Figure 7),
and the ink covered with a layer of polyvinyl acetate
(PVA) to seal it (J.E. Ivey, 1998 personal communication). Bones that appeared very fragmented were
mended with PVA in situ. Numbered bone was then
removed, wrapped individually in aluminum foil
along with a paper tag that provided provenience
information, including unit, bone layer, and bone
identification number. The bone was then placed in
paper bags. The next layer of bones was then deaned.
All matrix was screened through 114-inch screens.
Bone found in the screened matrix was bagged together by provenience, but was not numbered. The
bone was stored at the CAR curation facility.

Laboratory Methods
The bone was washed in tap water, and lightly
brushed with soft brushes when needed. Matrix

was removed from cavities with dental tools. Care
was taken to insure that provenience tags remained with the bone. The bone was air dried,
then placed in plastic bags, with provenience tags.
Each numbered bone was placed in a separate
bag, and unnumbered bones were bagged by unit
and layer.
Bone from six of the nine units that contained
the bone bed were examined, roughly 97 percent
of the total. The unexamined bone was from three
units with only a small part of the periphery of the
bone bed (see Figure 6).
The bone was identified by the author to the
most specific taxon possible using the comparative collection at CAR, as well as several standard
reference texts (Balkwill and Cumbaa 1992;
Boessneck 1970; Gilbert 1990; Hildebrand 1955;
Hillson 1986; Olsen 1960, 1964, 1968; Schmid
1972). Identifications were conservative; that is,
bone that appeared to be cow-sized was not identified as cattle (Bos taurus) unless it could be
differentiated from Bison and Equus (horse) species. Bone that could be identified to the order
taxonomic level was given an ID number in the
lab if it did not already have such a number.
The differentiation of Bos and Bison presents
an analytical challenge. The post-cranial skeletons
of these two genera are very much alike. Recent
work by Balkwill and Cumbaa (1992) has added
considerably to the data provided by Olsen (1960),
and their work provides a set of characteristics for
each post-cranial element that can be used to differentiate Bos and Bison. While these references
have made the task of differentiation easier, a comparative skeleton for both bovids must also be
available in order to correctly distinguish between
them. Differentiation is still difficult in many cases,
however, especially in fragmented bone.
Coding sheets were used to facilitate data collection. The data collected from all bone included:
taxon, count, weight, evidence of exposure to heat,
and evidence of gnawing. In addition, on bone
that could be identified to at least the order taxonomic level, the following data were collected,
whenever possible: element; portion of element;
whether the portion appeared to have been deliberately butchered (i.e., was the portion the result
entirely of butchering practices?); side; criterion
used to estimate age; estimated age class; whether
the bone had been broken, and if so, whether it
was broken while the bone was fresh, while the

made concerning what type of data

be categorized, how it will be ana1yzed, and, as Davis (1987:22)
points out, what will be published,
can affect the nature of the information that is eventually available
to the archeologist.

Relative Importance
Analytic Methods
This section will describe the methods used to
analyze some of the categories of data that were
recovered during this project. From the beginning,
it must be remembered that the bone being examined is only a sample, and a sample biased by many
different factors, most of which cannot be controlled (Figure 8). Beginning with the animals
available for use by humans, the combination of

Estimation of the relative abundance of taxa in
a collection is a subject of major concern in faunal
analysis (Baker et al. 1997; Grayson 1984; Lyman
1994a; Reitz and Scarry 1985:16-19). One is faced
with the problem of assessing what animals are
present in the collection, and ranking the importance
of each in the diet of the people who deposited
them in the site. The first part of the question
concerns not merely identifying the individual bone.
Among other things, it is necessary to consider how

taphonomic changes, both cultural and non-cultural,
have affected identifiability.
For the second part of the question, namely
what is the relative importance of each taxa, the
problem is compounded by the fact that in many
cases, it is the bone that is not present-the bone
that was taken away from the deposit-that was
the most important to the diet. Thus, it is
necessary to consider the nature of the deposit: is
it bone left at a kill site, a kitchen midden, or a
casual scatter? Methods for estimating actual
meat and other nutrients represented by bone have
been developed (Binford 1978; Casteel 1978;
Reitz and Scarry 1985:17-19; White 1953) but
each has problems.

The relative abundance of
animal taxa in a collection is
usually estimated by the Number of Identified Specimens
(NISP) or the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI), or often both (Lyman 1994b). NISP
is the easiest, as this is simply
the count of identified specimens (Lyman 1994b:43).
"Identified" is not strictly defined, however, and may be
used to mean all bone identified to any given taxonomic
level. Usually NISP is limited
to bone identified to the genus
and/or species level, although
it may include bone identified
only to family or even order. In
this article, NISP will be defined as the number of specimens identified to the genus or
species taxonomic level.
Serious problems, however,
are associated with using NISP
alone to quantify and compare
taxa in a faunal collection.
Grayson (1984:20-24) identified 11 most-cited criticisms of
specimen counts as a method
of estimating relative abundance. Of these, the most important are:

1. NISP counts are not independent. Thirty specimens of a given taxon may represent 30 individuals or 30 bones from a single individual, or
possibly even a single element. This lack of independence invalidates most statistical methods.
2. The use of NISP assumes that all specimens
are equally affected by taphonomic factors,
from weathering to butchering practices
(Grayson 1984:21). This is not the case. The
survival and identifiability of bone is mediated by (among other things) the size of the
bone (Von Endt and Ortner 1984), and the
bone density of various parts of the skeletal
element (Brain 1967; Lyman 1994a:234-235;
Lyman and O'Brien 1987). NISP is affected

Meissner-Analysis of Vertebrate Fauna! Remains from a Spanish Colonial Deposit 289
by butchering and transportation practices, so
that differences in specimen counts may simply reflect the fact that some butchering techniques may lead to more bone fragmentation
(Grayson 1984:20).
3. Numbers of readily identifiable specimens vary
greatly from taxa to taxa, so animals with distinctive bones will be identified more often
than animals with less distinctive bones
(Grayson 1984:21). For example, turtle carapace of the genus Trionyx (soft-shelled turtles)
is easily identified even in tiny fragments, while
much larger fragments of the carapace of most
other turtles are needed to identify the genus
(Sobolik and Steele 1996). Thus, the relative
abundance of soft-shelled turtles in a collection
may be overestimated by NISP.
In order to solve some of these problems, the
MNI is often preferred. This is the number of individuals of a given taxa needed to account for the
identified bone, as a measure of relative abundance.
This value is derived by dividing the identified
specimens of a taxa into left and right elements (or
portions of elements, such as distal femora, proximal humeri, etc.), and using a count of the most
abundant of the elements as the MNI represented
by the identified bone (Lyman 1994b:43). In addition, observations can include specimen size and/or
age to determine the MNI: if there are three adult
left proximal tibia and two right proximal tibia, one
of which is immature, the MNI would be four (the
three adult proximal left tibias plus an immature
animal). MNI has many advantages over NISP, especially in that the counts are all independent of
each other; that is, it is safe to assume that each left
distal femur represents one and only one animal
(Grayson 1984:28).
There are, however, grave problems with MNI
as well. Grayson (1984:29-49) has pointed out the
MNI of a taxa can be greatly altered, depending on
how the faunal collection is aggregated during
analysis. That is, a large difference in MNI numbers can be produced depending on how the specimens from a site are grouped: the entire site taken
as a unit, or divided by excavation unit, feature,
arbitrary level, natural level, or any other division
(see Grayson 1984:34-49). MNI also tends to overemphasize the value of small animals (Reitz and
Scarry 1985:17). In addition, it must also be re-

membered that an MNI of three for a given taxa
does not mean that three whole animals were present
on the site (Reitz and Scarry 1985:17), since in
both historic and prehistoric sites some animals
may have arrived in the site only as portions of
carcasses. Another problem is that MNI almost
always reduces the size of the data set to the point
that statistical analysis becomes difficult (Grayson
1984:50).
Grayson (1984:92) believes that MNI is a poor
method to estimate relative abundance because there
is no way around the aggregation problem unless it
is known exactly how the site was formed and what
parts of the site accumulated at the same time. All
things considered, Grayson prefers NISP to MNI
for estimates of relative abundance, since they provide "the best unit we have available for measuring
the relative abundance of vertebrate taxa in archaeological sites" (Grayson 1984:92).
Although Grayson's arguments against the use
of MNI are persuasive, it is a value that is often
used in faunal analyses. MNI values will be included in this article in order to facilitate use of this
data by other analysts, as well as to estimate the
number of each element which should be present in
the bone bed.

Bone Weight and Biomass
One way around the problem of NISP and
MNI is to consider that the main reason (at least in
this case) that we want to know the relative abundance of a taxon is that we want to understand its
relative importance in the diet. Neither NISP or
MNI should be used for this purpose. Clearly a
high NISP or MNI of rats in a site does not necessarily mean that rats composed a high percentage
of the nutrition in a diet, both because rats may or
may not have been eaten (especially in historic
sites) and because rats are very small mammals
compared to a deer or cow.
Estimates of meat weight represented by bone
in an assemblage may be a better method for estimating relative importance in a diet, since meat is
the primary (although not only) goal of dietary animal utilization. Specific methods for doing this,
however, are problematic. For instance, early versions of this method were based on generic estimates of the percentage of live weight of animals
that was edible (White 1953) multiplied by the MNI,
to give an estimate of total meat weight represented

290

Texas Archeological Society

by the bone (Davis 1987:36). These studies were
seriously flawed, because of the questionable accuracy of MNI as well as the fact that in many sites
only portions of a given animal were ever at the site
and were eaten (Reitz and Scarry 1985:18).
Reitz and Scarry (1985:18) describe a method
of estimating meat weight (biomass) that is based
on the fact that the amount of meat carried by a
bone increases exponentially as the bone weight
increases (Casteel 1978). The method uses an allometric equation based on the weight of the bone to
estimate biomass represented by the bone in question. The curve described by the equation is different for different taxa (Reitz and Scarry 1985:67
and Table 9). Reitz and Scarry (1985:19) believe
that this method results in a more accurate estimate of meat weight represented by bone. They
admit, however, that bone weight itself can be
influenced by many taphonomic variables and suggest that it be used only for comparing relative
importance within a site, where such factors can
be considered to have affected bone more or less
equally (Reitz and Scarry 1985: 19).
Although the method Reitz and Scarry
(1985: 19) use to estimate biomass represented by
bone weight is tempting, it has several problems. In
the first place, the assumption that taphonomic factors affecting bone weight are likely to do so equally
(i.e., as an equal or nearly equal percentage of the
bone weight of each bone) is invalid. As mentioned
above, bone density has a considerable affect on
how susceptible a given bone or portion of bone
may be to such factors as weathering and leaching
(see Brain 1967; Lyman 1994a:234-235; Lyman
and O'Brien 1987). In addition, the absolute size of
the bone, and whether the bone is whole or broken,
will also influence the degree to which taphonomic
factors affect the bone (Lyman 1994a:421-422; Von
Endt and Ortner 1984).
A more serious problem, however, is the nature of the equations used to estimate biomass. Although adjustments are made to describe the
relationship of bone weight to biomass for different
taxa (Reitz and Scarry 1985:67 and Table 9), the
equation assumes that that relationship is the same
for all bones in the animal. Yet it is clear that this is
not the case. The heavier, denser bones of the lower
legs of most animals do not, in fact, carry a great
deal of usable meat and thus represent body areas
of relatively low nutritional value, compared to
much lighter ribs and vertebrae. The equations used

to estimate biomass are based on the ratio of meat
weight to bone weight averaged over the whole
animal (Casteel 1978). The solution to this problem
is to divide the bones of the body into groups with
roughly similar nutritional value (e.g., lower legs,
thoracic vertebra, upper legs, etc.), and use ratios of
biomass to bone weight in each as the basis for
adjusting allometric equations used to estimate biomass. Unfortunately, the data needed for this solution are not available at this time. While the method
described by Reitz and Scarry (1985) is very useful
to more accurately estimate the relative importance
of taxa from different classes, it is problematic when
used to estimate relative importance among mammals alone.
Given the foregoing discussion, the decision
was made to use simple bone weight to estimate
relative importance in the meat diet of the bone
studied from the Radio Shack excavations at the
Alamo. The use of bone weight alone has many of
the same problems that calculation of biomass has.
As mentioned above, bone weight is differentially
affected by taphonomic factors, depending on size
and density of the individual bone. And, like estimates of biomass, bone weight also over-emphasizes taxa represented by large percentages of dense
lower limbs compared to taxa represented largely
by ribs and vertebra. The difference is that bone
weight, used alone as a measure of relative importance, does not attempt to estimate the actual amount
of meat represented by the bone.
Used together, NISP, MNI, and bone weight
can provide a picture of the relative importance of
a taxon to the diet. Each measure provides both
information and a check against some of the problems that plague the others. Use of all three together does not allow for a straightforward ranking
of taxa importance, however. The ability to do
this accurately in all situations awaits new analytic techniques.

Describing Butchery

What is butchery?
Lyman (1987:252) has defined butchering as
"the human reduction and modification of an animal carcass into consumable parts [where] 'consumable' is broadly construed to mean all forms of
use of carcass products including but not restricted
to consumption of products as food." Binford

Meissner-Analysis of Vertebrate Faunal Remains from a Spanish Colonial Deposit 291
(1978:48) notes that "butchery is not a single act
but a series of acts beginning when the animal is
killed and continuing at varying junctures until the
animal is totally consumed or discarded." Of interest in the faunal analysis is what particular parts
of the animal the butcher exploited, and for what,
and what processes were used to extract them
(Lyman 1994a:295). An underlying assumption of
studies of butchery is that it reflects the pragmatic
and efficient human use of the animal carcass
(Lyman 1994a:296).
Butchery is a process that uses different techniques depending on the intended use of various
parts of the animal carcass, the size of the carcass,
transportation logistics, and the tool technology
available to the butcher. Lyman (1994a:300) has
divided the process into a set of stages: (1) killbutchery, which involves slaughter of the animal
and any preliminary butchery done at the kill site
(such as gutting, partial disarticulation, and skinning) before transport of some or all of the carcass;
(2) secondary stage butchery, in which the carcass
is further processed, and some secondary transportation of the carcass parts takes place, even if only
the distribution of parts to a different area of the
site (to a cooking area, for instance); and (3) final
butchery-consumption stage, in which final processing and use of the various parts takes place.
Any unwanted parts will be discarded at each of
these stages.
One of the questions that must be considered
during analysis of butchery is: What is here, what is
not, and why? Human beings sometimes kill, process, eat, and dispose of an animal in the same
location, but usually at least some transportation of
at least some parts of the carcass takes place between the death of the animal and the final disposal
of all products acquired from it (Lyman 1994a:299).
Analysis of what parts of the carcass of each taxa
were present, and how each part was processed can
suggest what behaviors resulted in the presence of
bone in the excavated area.
Coding Bone Modifications
The choice of what data to collect in order to
study butchery in a faunal collection can be difficult. In a collection of any size, the time it takes to
collect needed data from an individual bone for a
very detailed study of butchery practices can be
prohibitive. The problem faced in this situation is

the coding of locations, type, and count of bone
modification in as efficient a manner possible, given
realistic time constraints, and most importantly, the
amount of information that is needed to pursue the
research design.
Methods used to understand the butchery of animals in an archeological site can range from mere
mention that a bone displays some kind of butcher
mark to detailed descriptions of all modifications,
including the nature, counts, exact location, and direction of such modification, and an analysis of the
presumed purpose (e.g., dismemberment, flaying,
filleting, processing for bone grease, etc.) that each
identifiable modification represents (Binford 1978,
1981). There have been several attempts to develop
such a system of coding (see Baker and Shaffer
1991; Lyman 1994a: 297-306). One of the most
detailed is th!).t of Shaffer and Baker (1992). This
system allows detailed coding of exact descriptions
and locations of bone modifications and includes
advice about the use of computer database systems
for collection and analysis of data.
The system proposed by Shaffer and Baker
(1992) has the advantage of completeness and flexibility. The location codes identify exact areas on
bone, such as "acetabular end of ischium," "horizontal ramus with diastema," and "semi-lunar
notch only" (Baker et al. 1997:310 and Table 13.3).
However, the number of bones to be examined
from the Radio Shack excavations made use of
this highly detailed method daunting, and the research design in this analysis made it unnecessary. The major question to be asked of the data
was: are any particular butchering patterns evident in this assemblage? In order to answer this
question the data needed was the number and type
of butcher marks on bone identifiable to the order
taxonomic level, and a general idea of the location
of these marks. The author and a colleague,
Johanna Hunziker, developed a series ofline drawings representing stylized bovid bones with general locations numbered on each. The location of
each modification was coded by (1) element; (2)
view (e.g., dorsal, anterior, lateral, etc.); and (3)
numbered location of modification. Figure 9 shows
an example of location codes for two bones, a
femur and a scapula.
Bone modification type was categorized as thin
cut (superficial), thick cut (superficial), chop (deep),
or impact scar; no saw-cut bone was recovered
from the bone bed. Chop marks were characterized

excavations (Table 1). A total of 3, 179 (28.5
percent) was identified to at least the order
taxonomic level and 1,881 (16.9 percent) were
identified to one of 37 genera. The bone was, in
general, in an excellent state of preservation. Very
few showed evidence of having been seriously
damaged. Not infrequently, bone was broken either
in the process of excavation or during packaging or
transportation; however, as the fragments of such
bones were packed together, wrapped in aluminum
foil, broken bones could be rejoined, so little or no
information was lost.
More than 97 percent of the bones identified to
class are mammalian. Reptiles are the next largest
class, with 1.2 percent, followed by birds with 1
percent. Fish and amphibians each comprise less
than 1 percent. In fact, only a single amphibian
bone was identified.
There were 38 bones found articulated with at
least one other bone (excluding unsealed epiphyses still articulated to metaphyses). All but one set
of articulated bones were portions of the lower
legs of animals. Most were cattle (Bos), however,
deer ( Odocoileus) feet and portions of the feet of a
young black bear ( Ursus) were also found articulated. The single set of articulated bones that was
not lower legs was three vertebrae from a young
alligator. Although articulated bones were found
in all levels, the majority were found in the uppermost layer of bone, Level 1, and thus were deposited last.

as rough or clean-edged. Generally speaking, cleanedged chop marks are almost certainly made with
metal tools, while rough-edged marks are more likely
(but not certainly) to have been made with a stone
tool (Binford 1981:105). Blumenschine et al. (1996)
have shown that such determinations can be reliably
made with the aid of low-powered magnification.
During the analysis, it was noted if characteristics of
a rough-edged chop were such that it was probably
(as opposed to possibly) made with a stone tool.

RESULTS OF THE FAUNAL
ANALYSIS
A total of 11, 14 2 animal bones, weighing
100,011.42 g, was analyzed from the Radio Shack

Table 2 lists all bone identified to the genus
taxonomic level, with NISP, MNI, and bone
weight. Thirty-seven different taxa are listed,
including 20 mammalian taxa, three bird taxa,
eight reptilian taxa, one amphibian taxon, and
five fish taxa.

NISP

Cattle (Bos) is by far the most common identified taxa, representing 47 percent of the total NISP
(see Table 2). Bison is the next most common, with
black bear third. The low numbers of other taxa is
striking. Thirteen taxa (34.2 percent) are represented
by less than five identified bone and 22 (57.9 percent) are represented by less than 10 bones.

Both bison and bear display the problem in
using NISP for assessing relative abundance. More
than half (124 of 230) of the bison bones are from a
single, highly fragmented skull. The bear bone consists of a highly fragmented skull and the bones of
the feet, including the unsealed epiphyses of the
metapodials and a distal radius, probably from a
single individual. While bison is one of the more
abundant taxa according to MNI and weight (see
below), the high NISP of the bear is misleading. If
NISP percentages were used without consideration
of MNI and bone weight, the result would be an
inaccurate estimate of relative abundance.
The way that these bones were excavated and
stored permits an adjustment of the raw NISP numbers to allow, to some extent, for fragmented bones.
Bones with ID numbers were packaged separately,
so even if they were fragmented during excavation

or afterwards, they retained a single ID number.
For instance, the cow skull labeled 884 in the field
was very fragile, and in the process of excavating,
storing, and cleaning it, it was broken into 232
pieces. These fragments were kept together, and
still have a single ID number. Another example is
the goat radius labeled 941, which is broken in four
pieces. The computer database makes it possible to
find those bones that had ID numbers, and were
fragmented. For each of these, the NISP could be
adjusted to 1. Of course, only bone that had been
numbered and packaged together could be treated
in this fashion. Table 3 shows the bone identified to
one of the mammal genera, with NISP and adjusted
NISP. The percent of the total listed in Table 3 is
probably a more accurate estimate of the relative
abundance of mammals in the bone bed than the
percentage of raw NISP. Bison is only about half as

abundant according to the percentage of adjusted
NISP than in the raw NISP counts. The percentage
of bear is also reduced. Cows, and deer, on the
other hand, have a higher percentage of the total
adjusted NISP (see Table 3). Differences for other
taxa are small. The ranking of mammals by abundance after adjusting the NISP shows that cattle are
by far the most abundant, with bear, bison, deer,
sheep, and equids the next most abundant.
While this method of adjusting NISP did permit allowances to be made for some of the bone
fragmentation, it did not solve all the problems
associated with using NISP as a measure of relative
abundance. The abundance of bear is, for instance,
still overestimated by this method.

part, given an MNI of 13 (see Table 2). Complete
long bones are listed twice, once for proximal and
once for distal ends. There is a higher percentage of
observed proximal metatarsals, compared to the
expected number, than any other body part. Distal
tibia, proximal radius, and proximal metacarpal have
the next highest percentage of expected counts. All
other body parts listed had less than half the
expected counts. Distal ribs were the least
represented in the bone bed, with only 0.3 percent
of the expected numbers.

MNI

Cattle also dominate the MNI, with 13 (see
Table 2). The next highest MNI is sheep (Ovis)
with four and bison (Bison) with three. Only four
other genera had an MNI of two. However, MNI
was calculated by aggregating the entire analyzed
collection. It is possible that this is not how the
bone bed accumulated, in which case these MNI
would underestimate the actual abundance of
some taxa.
Bone Weight

Bone weight has the advantage of combining
all identified bone, no matter how fragmented. If
the bone weight is used as an estimate of relative
dietary importance of the different taxa identified,
the dominance of cattle is even more apparent than
in MNI, NISP, or adjusted NISP. Bos bone is more
than 76 percent of the weight of bones identified to
the genus level. In comparison, Bison comprises
about 19 percent, while only horse and deer were
more than 1 percent of the weight of the total NISP
(see Table 2).
Together, domestic animals make up 79.3 percent of the total identified bone weight. Bison is the
only wild animal with a significant percentage of
total bone weight.

Cattle Elements Present
Table 4 shows the numbers of body parts of
cattle compared to expected numbers of that body

The only intact long bones of Bos or Bison
were a radius and a number of metapodials. A total
of 14 complete bovid metapodials were identified,
three of which were articulated to the rest of the
lower leg.
Figure 10 shows locations where at least two
chop marks and/or impact scars were observed
on the bones. This figure is only a guide to location of the butcher marks, however. It may appear, for instance, that the radius, ulna, and tibia
were more heavily processed than the femur or
humerus, but this is because, as mentioned earlier,
there were many more examples of the radius and
ulna in the collection (see Table 4). The nearabsence of femora identified as Bos, for instance,
makes it difficult to determine how they were routinely processed.
Crania were generally in very fragmented condition, but all appeared to have been chopped open
down the middle (Figure lOa). Most marks on mandibles were either just posterior to the diastema or
at the beginning of the ascending ramus. These
breaks were either chopped or hammered, with chop
marks either clean or rough (Figure lOb).
The pelvis was chopped just above the acetabulum, usually with a metal tool, and again at the
neck of the illium. The pubis was either broken
without leaving chop or impact marks, or was left
intact (Figure lOc).
Only six scapula identified as Bos had chop or
impact marks on them (Figure lOd). On five of
these, the acromion process had been removed by a
series of chops, usually rough-edged, from the
dorsal end. The scapula were either chopped or

articulation with the humerus. In some cases there
were chop marks just dorsal of the articulation, or
in the glenoid fossa itself, always with a metal tool,
although these chops usually did not cut all the way
through the bone.
Because only the proximal end and, in some
cases, the distal half are distinctive in bovids, many
rib fragments could not be identified to genus, Bos
or Bison (Figure lOe ). There were 17 proximal rib

were chopped from the dorsal side, with either clean

be identified as Bos. There were four clean chop
marks near its proximal end.

marks left on cervical vertebrae, as they appeared
in no particular location. However, all but one of
the chop marks were from metal tools. Thoracic

of butchery. In most cases, the spinous process was
broken or chopped off near the neural arch and the
articulation with the ribs was chopped away, leaving
only the neural arch and the centrum intact (Figure
lOf). Most of these chops were probably made with

metal tools. In some cases the centrum was split up
the middle from the dorsal side, much as modern
butchers do. In other examples, the centrum was
chopped in half from the side. Chops through the
centrum were always made with a metal tool.

Heat Alteration
There is very little evidence of heat
alteration in this collection. Only 1.6 percent (n=l 79) of the total bone showed evidence of having been exposed to heat. Of
these only 16 (9 percent) were calcined or
partially calcined, indicating exposure to
high levels of heat for long periods of time.
David (1990) has shown that bone is unlikely to become calcined under normal
cooking conditions, and the presence of
calcined bone can usually be attributed to
deliberate disposal of bone by burning.
Clearly this bone bed was not used as a
location for the secondary deposition of
previously burned bone. Most of the
burned bone in the Radio Shack collection
appears to be the result of cooking activities; however, little of the bone shows even
this amount of heat alteration.

The very low counts of rodent and carnivoregnawed bone, and the very large number of
ungnawed epiphyseal ends, strongly suggests that
either the bone was buried shortly after it was
deposited, or that it had been rendered undesirable
to scavengers by some other means, such as boiling. As there is little evidence of bone grease
extraction in this collection (see discussion below), it seems likely that the bone was buried
shortly after deposition.

differences appear significant. Roughly half of the
bone shows Stage l weathering in each level. All
levels have unweathered bone and all levels have 3
stages of weathered bone, although there is somewhat less Stage 3 bone in levels 3 and 4.
Bone that showed differential weathering
(i.e., more weathering on one side or one end
than on the other) is also listed in Table 5. While
this bone comprises only 5.9 percent of the total
weathered bone, it constitutes important evidence
that, although most of the bone seems to have
been buried fairly rapidly after deposition, at least
some of the bone was partially exposed, either
by incomplete initial burial or by erosion at some
later date.
Gnawing
All bone was examined for evidence of gnawing. A total of 41 bones (0.37 percent) shows evidence of rodent gnawing, another 118 bone (1.1
percent) had carnivore tooth marks, and two bones
had some evidence of chewing, but the agent was
not determined. Lyman (1994a:276) points out that
although bone dragged away or eaten whole by
carnivores cannot, obviously, be part of the assemblage, there should be plenty of tooth marks on
bone from a ravaged assemblage. Epiphyses are the
most desirable for gnawing, both because of their
high grease component and their low density, making them easy to chew. In a ravaged assemblage
there should be a notable lack of epiphyseal ends
(Lyman 1994a:276).

DISCUSSION
In this part of the article, I will use the data
presented above to consider: (1) what function
within the community did the bone bed serve?; (2)
as expressed by the bone in this location, what was
the meat diet of the mission community?; and (3)
what does the bone tell us about butchering and
distribution practices?
Bone Bed Function
The concentration of bone in one limited area
suggested that this was a designated place to throw
bone, but was it for dumping general garbage, or
possibly a primary or secondary butchering area?
One way to assess bone bed function is to examine
what parts of the body of Bos taurus, by far the
most common taxon, are represented in the bone
bed. If the bone bed was an area designated during
a (presumably brief and possibly intermittent) period
for general dumping of garbage from the entire
mission, then we would expect to see all body parts
of cattle represented more or less as they occur in a
complete body. That is, since the Spanish reports
indicate that cattle were brought to the mission to
be slaughtered (Habig 1978: 135), if all the garbage
from the mission during a particular period was
dumped there, then we would expect to find most
of the cattle bone from that period dumped in that
area. If, on the other hand, the area was a dump
near a butchering area, used primarily for disposal
of unwanted parts of the slaughtered animals, then
bone bearing the most meat should be missing from
the area. A third possibility is that the area was a
kitchen midden, at which remains from food
preparation was left, in which case bone that carries
large amounts of meat should be most common.
Thus, estimates of the relative importance in the

302

Texas Archeological Society

diet of various body parts, compared to the
abundance of that part in the bone bed, will provide
clues as to the function of the bone bed.
In order to estimate the relative importance of
any given body part to a meat diet, Binford's
(1978: 19) Meat Utility Index (MUI) for caribou was
used. This index is a straightforward assessment of
the meat weight carried by each bone, with no consideration of the quality of that meat (Binford
1978: 19-23). It was developed by calculating the
gross weight (that is, dressed weight, exclusive of
skin, blood, and internal organs) of each anatomical
part (thoracic vertebrae, femur, carpals, etc.) as a
percentage of the total gross weight of the animal, so
that a measure of the proportion of the total animal
that each part represents could be made (Binford
1978: 19). Binford then multiplied this times the percentage of non-bone weight for each part. The index
values were then standardized on a scale from 1 to
100. While there are clearly differences in body size
between cattle and caribou, both Binford (1978:475)
and Speth (1983:88) felt that there was enough general similarity in relative proportions of the body that
the MUI for caribou could be used, with caution, to
estimate bison MUI values. Cattle are, if anything,
more like caribou in general body shape than bison
are, so the caribou MUI was employed to estimate
the relative utility of cattle elements.
Figure 12 shows a scatter plot of the percent
of expected count (see Table 4) compared to
Binford' s MUI. This figure shows that, in general,
the more meat utility a part has, the less likely it is
to occur in a high percentage of the expected

numbers. The body parts with the least meat utility
are the most variable.
Bone marrow is another important resource
available in a carcass. To examine the bone bed
compared to a bone marrow utility index, the values for calories produced per hour of processing
time from various body parts were used (Jones and
Metcalfe 1988:471 and Table 3). These values were
standardized by dividing the calories per hour by
the largest value and then multiplying the result by
100, in order to produce a Standardized Marrow
Utility Index (SMUI) with values of 1 to 100. In
addition, only broken metapodials were counted in
the percent of expected count, since unbroken
metapodials clearly had not been used for marrow
production. The scatter plot in Figure 13 shows the
comparison of the SMUI to the (modified) percent
of expected count. There seem to be two trends
depicted in Figure 13. First, the tibia, proximal
metatarsal, and radius/ulna have a high utility value
and a relatively high percentage of expected count.
On the other hand, the femurs, humeri, and distal
metatarsal have high marrow utility value and low
percentages of expected count. The metacarpals
have fairly low utility and low percentages of expected count.
This pattern can be explained if the butchers
usually extracted marrow from tibias and radius/
ulna and then discarded them, whereas the femur
and humerus were distributed, and were not usually
left in this area. Removal of marrow from the large
cavities in these bones does not destroy their identifiability. In fact, all of the long bones left in the
bone bed except some metapodials
seem to have been routinely broken
open, presumably to extract marrow.

to believe that little, if any, bone grease extraction
was actually taking place during the time this bone
bed accumulated. The apparent correspondence of
low grease utility and high percentage of expected
count is probably a reflection of the meat utility
rather than grease utility of the bone elements.
In light of the discussion above, what can be
said about the function of this bone bed? Clearly,
it was a designated bone disposal area. Just as
clearly, it was not where all the bone was discarded (see Table 4). The evidence suggests that
this area was primarily a place for secondary processing of carcasses, and probably a distribution
area. Some primary butchering probably took place
in the area, however. The relatively small number
of skulls (three of an expected 13), and relatively
small numbers of foot bones (72 of an expected
312), suggest that slaughter and preliminary butchering, including removal of the head and feet, did
not always take place in the area. The fact that
almost all long bones present (with the exception
of metapodials) were broken open, presumably to
extract marrow, indicates that some processing of
bone did take place in the area, but the relatively
low percentages of expected bones that carry large
amounts of meat (see Figure 12) suggest that these
parts of the carcass were distributed, and the bone
disposed of elsewhere. The presence of articulated
feet (23 of 72 foot bones were articulated in six
groups) indicates that the remains of early stages
of butchering were sometimes, but not always,
discarded here.
One more piece of evidence contributes to the
assessment of the bone bed as primarily a butchering and distribution area where unwanted portions
were discarded. As mentioned earlier, there is very
little evidence of heat alteration of any kind. While
it is likely that much of the meat was boiled in
soups and stews (especially since the meat of these
cattle was likely to be fairly tough), at least some
evidence of roasting should be present on bone that
had reached the household level of processing (see
discussion of butchering and distribution below).
There was, in fact, very little such evidence. This
suggests that most of the bone in this bone bed did
not reach the household level of processing, and
was, in fact, discarded during the secondary butchering process.
Some general trash dumping also seems to have
taken place at this bone bed. While some general
trash such as ceramics and lithics may be present as

a secondary deposit, accidentally included when
the bone was buried, the fairly large numbers of
ceramics, the presence of bison and deer bone, and
the articulated bear feet, indicate that something
other than cattle butchering was contributing to the
accumulation of the bone bed.
Meat Diet at the Mission
Reitz and Scarry (1985:84) have pointed out
that features such as trash dumps or bone beds are
not necessarily representative of the complete meat
diet in historic sites. They emphasize that a
complete assessment of diet requires samples from
diverse contexts, and that "archaeologists working
with the historic period must be alert to the hazards
of confining subsistence analysis to single small
features" (Reitz and Scarry 1985:84). When it is
necessary to confine consideration of diet to a
single feature, care must be taken to remember the
possible limitations that are involved under those
circumstances. The discussion of bone bed
function made it clear that not all bone used at the
mission during the period when the Radio Shack
bone bed was being formed ended up in that
bone bed. The following discussion must, as a
result, be viewed with some caution, as it concerns
only that bone found in this one location, in a
single feature.
Another problem with assessing the meat diet
at the mission, as represented by the bone bed, is
that we know that this bone bed consists largely of
bone associated with what, at least for the cattle,
was not eaten. In addition, all the problems associated with attempting to estimate relative abundance
and relative importance discussed earlier make such
assessments difficult.
Issues of bone survival can be important, as
well. For instance, most of the identified pig bone
was from immature animals. Immature bone is
well known to be more susceptible to damage
from taphonomic factors than mature bone because of its relative size and its low density (Lyman
1994a:397; Reitz and Scarry 1985:11). There may
be a great deal of pig bone that was not identifiable, due to differential damage to the immature
bone, compared to the more mature sheep, goat,
and deer.
Given these difficulties, we can still get a sense
of the diet at the mission, at least as represented
by this bone bed. Further analysis of bone from

Meissner - Analysis of Vertebrate F annal Remains from a Spanish Colonial Deposit 305
other contexts at Mission San Antonio de Valero,
both already excavated and currently still in the
ground, will be needed to complete the picture
presented here.
Examination of the NISP, MNI, and bone
weight makes is very clear that cattle were the
dominant source of meat as represented by this
bone bed. In fact, 33 (89.2 percent) other genera
have less than 1 percent of the weight of bone
identified to the genus level (see Table 2). Of all
the other genera, only bison has enough bone weight
to be considered an important component. The meat
diet represented by this bone bed is, then, overwhelmingly beef, with some bison. All other sources
of meat are unimportant.
Archival records tend to agree with this assessment. Guidelines written for missionaries at
about 1760 advised, "Every week the missionary
must see to it that the supply of beef cattle are
brought to be rationed for the sustenance of the
Indians ... Generally, four or six are slaughtered
when the natives are few" (Leutenegger 1976:19).
In October 1755, a report from Mission San Jose
noted "for the weekly ration 7 beef cattle are
slaughtered, 4 for those living at the mission, 1 for
the shepherds, 1 for the cowboys, and 1 which is
made into jerked meat for the convalescents.
Chicken and mutton are also given to the sick"
(Habig 1978:135). The population of Native
Americans at San Jose at the time of this report
was 194 (Habig 1978:122). Even assuming that
the cattle in question were small and fairly lean,
this suggests that an enormous quantity of meat
was being consumed, even without including other
meat sources, such as sheep, goats, pigs, and nondomesticated animals. While this information concerns another mission, it is safe to assume that
large amounts of meat were being consumed at
Mission San Antonio as well.
There is indirect evidence that food supplies
in general and meat in particular were plentiful
during the time the bone bed was deposited. Most
of the metapodials of cattle, sheep, and bison
present in the bone bed are not broken. While
these bones do not provide a great deal of meat,
there is a significant amount of marrow available
in them, especially in the metatarsal (see Jones
and Metcalfe 1988:471 and Table 3). The failure
to take advantage of this food resource certainly
suggests that meat (and especially fat) supplies
were more than adequate.

Other evidence that suggests that meat and fat
supplies were plentiful is the lack of evidence for
bone grease extraction. It is possible, given the
fact that the bones with highest bone grease yields
have the lowest percentage of expected count (see
Figure 14), that these bones in particular were
carried away (along with the large amounts of
meat they carry), and utilized for grease extraction. If so, the detritus from this processing was
not dumped in this bone bed. One piece of evidence against the idea that bone grease was being
extracted is the relatively large numbers of tibias.
Although tibias have only moderate meat utility
value, the proximal tibia is ranked third in bone
grease utility (Brink 1997:263 and Table 3). Yet
46.2 percent of the expected proximal tibias are
present in the bone bed (see Table 5). It seems
unlikely that extensive bone grease extraction was
being carried out, presumably because the yield of
fat from such activities was not worth the effort,
given the presence of other sources of fat.
There is, then, considerable evidence in the
archeological and archival records that meat and
carbohydrates were abundantly available to the
Native Americans at Mission San Antonio, and
that the vast majority of this meat came from cattle.
However, while there is no reason to doubt the
importance of cattle to the diet of the missions,
some caution must be introduced here. This bone
bed does not, as has been discussed, seem to be a
general bone dump. If, as is suspected, this dump
is associated primarily with cattle butchering, then
it is natural to find mostly cattle bone in it. The
incidental inclusion of other bone will not necessarily occur in proportion to their actual use at the
mission. In other words, a great deal more goats,
sheep, pig, and deer may have made up part of the
diet than is shown in this bone bed.
Butchering and Distribution
Practices
Archival records tell us that cattle were
butchered weekly for distribution to the neophytes
(Habig 1978:135; Leutenegger 1976:19). They do
not tell us exactly how the cattle were butchered.
Evidence from this bone bed suggests that, as both
Binford (1978) and Lyman (1994a:300) have
pointed out, butchering is a series of events that do
not necessarily happen at the same place or time.
The following consideration of butchering practices

306

is, of necessity, based solely on evidence from this
bone bed.
As has been discussed above on bone bed
function, it appears that cattle were slaughtered
some distance from the mission and the carcass
moved (at least on some occasions) to an area near
the wall, where secondary butchering took place,
and waste discarded. It is interesting to note that
beheading of cattle and other animals seems to have
almost always been done with a metal tool,
presumably an ax or hatchet. Skulls were chopped
down the center, presumably to remove the brains.
The carcass was then dismembered at the major
joints. Marks of metal tools were common on the
scapula at its articulation with the humerus and the
pelvis at the acetabulum, indicating that legs were
also removed with metal tools. The separation of
uppermost leg bones from the rest of the leg then
took place, probably more often with metal tools,
although the scarcity of humerus and femur makes
it difficult to be sure. Apparently these bones,
presumably with their meat, were distributed at this
point, as they were rarely found in this collection
(see Table 4).
Marks indicating removal of carpals, tarsals,
and metapodials from the rest of the leg are rare,
and consist mostly of thin cut marks, not chop
marks. The relative lack of foot bones indicate that
either they were usually removed during preliminary butchering or that they were distributed. Since
foot bones provide little utility in any nutritional
category, the former seems most likely. In several
cases, the metapodials, either whole or broken at
the center of the diaphysis, were found still articulated to the feet.
The radius and humerus are fairly rare in the
collection, indicating that these, too, were often
distributed at this point. Tibias, on the other hand,
were broken open, presumably 5itripped of meat,
and left at the bone bed.
Portions of the pelvis were apparently distributed still attached to the meat, but it should be
noted that the fragmented bovid pelvis is difficult
to assign to Bos or Bison and thus would not be
considered in the butchering study. If those pelvis
fragments that were identified only as Bovinae are
added to those known to be Bos (Table 6), it is clear
that the lower part of the pelvis, the ischium and
pubis, are relatively rare. Apparently the meat was
stripped from the illium, and the bone remained at
the bone bed, but the ischium and pubis were car-

ried away with the meat. These portions of the
pelvis were usually broken away from the acetabulum, not chopped.
The ribs present a similar identification problem. Although proximal and distal rib sections are
fairly easy to identify to species, the remainder of
the ribs are not easy to differentiate between Bos
and Bison. As a result, only proximal ribs are included in the butchering marks study. Proximal
ribs were one of the most poorly represented in the
bone bed collection (see Table 4). Most proximal
ribs were removed and disposed of elsewhere. Since
the proximal rib carries a large and tender section
of meat, this is not surprising. There were 93 medial sections of ribs identified as Bos or Bovinae.
Clearly the medial section of rib was routinely removed and discarded at the butchering area.
The almost complete absence of distal ribs is
something of a mystery. Only a single distal rib
was identifiable as Bos. Only 9 of 240 (3.8 percent)
bovid rib fragments are distal ends. Distal ribs do
not, however, carry any large amount of meat, nor
do they supply large amounts of marrow or bone
grease. It does not seem likely that they would be
distributed to the households when medial rib
sections were not. Yet the distal ends of the ribs
were obviously removed from the medial section of
the ribs at some point before the latter were
discarded. Two possible answers to the puzzle are:
(1) the distal ribs were routinely cut off during the
gutting of the animal, and were discarded where
this process was carried out; and (2) the distal ribs
are associated with a part of the cow which, while
not especially nutritious, was popular. The fact that
only one bovid sternum was identified makes the
first possibility more likely. The distal ribs, and the
sternum to which they were attached, could have

been cut away from the rest of the rib cage in order
to open the thoracic cavity so that heart, mesentery,
and lungs could removed. These organs are highly
nutritious, and chopping away the sternum with distal
ribs attached would make their removal much easier.
Thoracic vertebrae were present in much less
than expected numbers (see Table 4). It seems likely
that they were often distributed with the proximal
ribs still attached. When present, the spinous process had almost invariably been chopped or broken
off and often left at the bone bed (identified as
Bovinae). Usually the articular process was also
chopped or broken away in the process of detaching the ribs.
Lumbar vertebrae were somewhat more likely
to be found in the bone bed (see Table 5), but
they, too, usually had their spinous processes, as
well as the transverse processes, broken away. Of
the 156 transverse processes that should have been
present on 13 cows, only five (3.2 percent) were
actually recovered (identified as Bovinae). It appears that lumbar vertebrae were either distributed
with the loin meat, or the meat was stripped off,
with the transverse process included, leaving only
the centrum and neural arch to be discarded.
Butchering at the mission seems to have been
accomplished in stages. Cattle were slaughtered
and some preliminary butchering took place, including the removal of the sternum and distal ribs.
In the secondary processing location the carcass
was dismembered and distributed. Removal of
head and feet apparently sometimes took place at
this time. Long bones that were not distributed
were usually broken open, presumably to extract
marrow, but they often did not bother doing this to
the metapodials.
The removal of the head and legs seems to
have been fairly routinely done with a metal tool,
while other parts of the dismemberment process
appear to have been done either with metal or stone
tools. It is possible that metal tools were sometimes
difficult to acquire. Letters from Governor Antonio
Martinez in the early 1800s repeatedly begged for
more iron, claiming that all available iron had already been used to repair cannon and small arms
(Hatcher 1935:69, 141, 142, 146, 237). This was,
however, after secularization and, in any case, is
likely to be an exaggeration. The inventory of the
mission done in 1772 lists 13 axes (Leutenegger
1977:33). It is probably more likely that for some
parts of the butchering process, butchers at the mis-

307

sions preferred to use the stone tools with which
they were familiar.
The remainder of the butchering process took
place at what may be termed the household level,
although, in fact, a certain amount of communal
final butchering, cooking, and eating of the meat
may well have taken place. Bones were then disposed of, usually not in the bone bed left by the
earlier butchering process.

Implications of Wasteful
Butchering Practices
One of the most interesting facts determined
by this faunal analysis is the apparently casual way
that some body parts were discarded without processing. Several lower legs were discarded without
any processing, and most of the metapodials present
had not been broken open to remove marrow, even
though the metatarsal is a richer source of calories
per hour of processing than the humerus (see Jones
and Metcalfe 1988:471 and Table 3). As mentioned
above, bone grease, a small but potentially important portion of the total calories available from cattle,
does not seem to have been an important consideration in carcass use.
The reason for this rather wasteful use of carcasses is probably the relatively great abundance of
beef available. In addition, the evidence suggests
that there were plenty of carbohydrates, either in
the form of fats or as starches, available to the
inhabitants of the mission. Of the resources available from cattle, it is the marrow and the bone
grease, both very rich in fats, that appear to have
been the least utilized. The missionaries reported
that their irrigated fields were producing large quantities of com as well as other crops (Habig 1978: 101,
134, 157, 211), so this source of carbohydrates was
available, as well as the fat in the meat of the cattle
and other animals eaten at the mission.

The Decline of Texas Herds

The apparent abundance of beef suggested by
the failure to utilize the entire carcass may help us
limit the time period in which the bone bed may
have accumulated. There is evidence that several
factors, including environmental as well as
demographic and political, led to a decline of cattle
populations in the latter part of the mission period.

308

Texas Archeological Society

Roundups at San Jose's ranch from 1749 to
1767 had produced an average of about 1500 head
(Hard et al. 1995:81). Yet, in a 1785 report
concerning a roundup of the herd, the missionary
indicated that, after considerable effort on the part
of the vaqueros, only 682 cattle were found, which
"were all very lean. In the end it was necessary to
set them loose. Things were so bad that by the
present time many may have already died" (Habig
1978:244).
The inventory done at Mission San Antonio in
1772 claimed that a "fair estimate" of cattle at La
Mora, the ranch belonging to the mission, was 4000
to 5000 head (Leutenegger 1977). This changed
dramatically during the next ten years. Table 7 lists
the total cattle counted during roundups for the
years 1780-1782 (Jackson 1986: 220, 230, 245).
Even assuming that the estimate in 1772 had been
overly optimistic and the actual count was closer to
3000, the 1782 count was less than one-quarter of

Table 7. Cattle Counts from La Mo:ra

that. In fact, the count declined by more than half in
just that three year period.
This was not a short-term problem. According
to Jackson (1986:221, 224, 228, 248, 268, 293,
309, 346, 397), throughout the 1780s and 1790s
inhabitants of the upper San Antonio Valley fought
over herds of semi-wild cattle that were becoming
more and more scarce. Things had become so serious by 1794 that Governor Munoz imposed a
quota on cattle that could be slaughtered for family needs and banned the killing or export of breeding cows (de la Teja 1995:111). When the last of
the missions in the area was secularized in 1794,
Jackson (1986:411) notes "nothing remained of

the once considerable wealth in livestock except a
few milk cows." In 1803, Governor Elguezabal
reported "There is a notable scarcity of cattle" (de
la Teja 1995:112).
There appear to have been a number of causes
of this cattle decline. One of them appears to be
environmental. Tree ring data from East Texas show
that the period between about 1770 and 1810 was
unusually dry, with only two relatively wet years
during the entire 40 year period (Stahl and
Cleaveland 1988). This dry period could have been
very hard on the cattle roaming on the large mission ranches. The semi-arid vegetation of the area
tends to die back during dry periods, waiting for
new rain to activate rapid growth (Wright and Van
Dyne 1976). Cattle may have found it difficult to
find enough food during extended dry periods, and
their fertility would have been reduced. Additionally, they may have tended to wander farther than
they ordinarily would, thus making them harder to
find (Jackson 1986:127, 301).
Another reason for the decline may have been
the increase in predation by all the inhabitants of
the area. Apaches, and later the Comanches and
other hostile Native groups, had been a constant
drain on the cattle population from the beginning.
By 1781, the Comanches in particular were causing
so much trouble that most of the ranches, including
mission and civilian ranches, were deserted most of
the time, and the cattle left to fend for themselves
(Jackson 1986:224).
The Spanish population of the valley was increasing. Cattle were often slaughtered indiscriminately. Sometimes meat hunters would kill many
cattle and take only the very choicest portions
back with them, leaving the rest to rot (Jackson
1986: 16). In addition, ranchers were now rounding up herds of cattle, not for subsistence, but for
driving to the markets south of the Rio Grande,
such as Saltillo in Nuevo Leon (Jackson 1986:130).
An estimated 18,000 cattle were driven to Coahuila
and Nuevo Santander between 1779 and 1786 (de
la Teja 1995:111).
Constant arguments between civilian ranchers
and missionaries, as well as a need to increase
revenues, led the Commander General of the Province, Teodoro de la Croix, to declare in 1778 that
all adult unbranded cattle were the property of the
king, and henceforth a license must be obtained and
a fee paid before slaughtering or exporting such
cattle (Jackson 1986:155). This edict made both

Meissner-Analysis of Vertebrate Faunal Remains from a Spanish Colonial Deposit 309
civilian ranchers and missionaries very unhappy.
They claimed that it was impossible to keep their
cattle branded, due to a lack of manpower and the
constant threat of attack by hostile Native Americans (Jackson 1986:220). Even unbranded cattle
were in short supply (Jackson 1986:268). In 1785,
one missionary lamented:
In the past the income from the herds and
the missionaries' allowance alone was
enough to clothe the Indians and pay the
expenses of the Divine Cult, now without [the cattle herds], there is not enough
for either. As a result...these wretches are
made to suffer and endure great sorrow,
while they observe that the Apaches are
allowed ... to cause excessive damages to
their cattle and that the soldiers and citizens are permitted to slaughter them
(Dabbs 1991:453).
This statement was part of a plea for a change
in de la Croix's edict, and can be assumed to be
exaggerated, but it seems that, for the first time
since their arrival in the valley, the missionaries
were having trouble feeding their charges (Jackson
1986:294). They continued these complaints until
the missions were secularized in 1793 (Mission
San Antonio) and 1794 (the other four missions in
the area) (Jackson 1986:410-411).
It is possible, given the failure to extract all the
available fat resources from the cattle whose partial
remains were discarded at the Radio Shack bone
bed, that the bone bed dates before the 1780 period,
when a combination of events led to a scarcity of
cattle, both at the missions and throughout the immediate area. This is, of course, only a possibility,
based on evidence of declining cattle herds, and on
the assumption that the sample from the bone bed
is representative of the general behavior of mission
butchers at the time. As Reitz and Scarry (1985:81)
have pointed out, it is important not to read too
much into data from a single feature. Future data
may help to resolve this issue.

SUMMARY AND
CONCLUSIONS
In 1979, a project to link Alamo Plaza and the
Riverwalk was begun. During the initial stages of

this project it was discovered that one building
did not have a basement. This was important
because the building was believed to straddle the
remains of the west wall of Mission San Antonio
de Valero, the first of the Spanish missions in
San Antonio.
Subsequent excavation inside this building revealed undisturbed sediments containing cultural
remains from approximately 250 years of habitation in the area, including intact Spanish Colonial
deposits. A distinct bone bed in an old arroyo was
discovered and excavated with great care. It can be
dated between 1748 and about 1800 by the presence of a coin beneath the bone bed and the dates
for the types of majolica recovered within the bone
bed (M. Brown, 1998 personal communication).
The bone bed was located only about 14 feet outside the west wall of the mission compound, near
its southwest corner.
Bone from six of eight units within which the
bone bed was excavated were analyzed, a total of
11,142 bones. These bones were, for the most part,
in excellent condition, due in part to being covered
by the building part of the time they had been
buried. Not only did the presence of the building
protect the bone from further disturbance, but it
also provided at least some protection from leaching, and even possible erosion by rainwater. Evidence from the pattern of weathering and absence
of scavenging suggests that this bone bed developed as a series of episodes of dumping, burial,
and re-exposure by erosion. While it is clear that
erosion at times exposed some of the bone to
weathering damage, the presence of articulated
bone in all levels suggests that erosion of the area
was not severe.
Most of the bone was in large pieces, allowing
16.9 percent of it to be identified to the genus
taxonomic level. Domestic cattle (Bos taurus) were
by far the most common of the 37 genera
identified, with 47 percent of the NISP of bone
identified to genus and more than three times the
number of MNI compared to the next highest,
sheep (see Table 2). Bison has the second highest
NISP and third highest MNI. Adjusting the NISP
by reducing to 1 the counts of fragmented bone
known to have been a single bone at the time of
excavation increased the relative abundance of
cattle somewhat and decreased the relative
abundance of bison by almost half. When bone
weight is considered, the dominance of cattle is

310

Texas Archeological Society

very apparent. Among bone identified to the genus
taxonomic level, only cattle (76.2 percent) and
bison (18.9 percent) constituted more than 2
percent of the bone weight (see Table 3).
The presence of trash such as discarded lithics
and ceramics, as well as the presence of so many
different taxa, is evidence that the bone bed was
used at least part of the time as a general trash
dump. However, the cattle elements present in the
bone bed indicate that the majority of the bone bed
accumulated as a result of proximity to a secondary
butchering area, where carcasses were dismembered, distributed, and the unwanted portions discarded. In general, elements with high meat utility
are much less common in the bone bed than elements with low utility. Bones with low bone grease
utility are much more abundant in the bone bed
than bone with high bone grease utility, but there is
evidence that this is related more to the close correspondence of meat and bone grease utility indices
than to the actual processing of bone for bone
grease. In fact, the only evidence that bones may
have been processed for grease is that the bones
with the highest bone grease utility are largely missing from the bone bed; the tibias are an exception.
Although they are very high in bone grease utility,
they are present in large numbers, suggesting that
bone grease utility was not an important factor in
the decision of what to throw away in this bone
bed. In addition, the many small bone fragments
that are the result of processing for bone grease are
not present in the bone bed.
The failure to utilize some portions of the
cattle carcasses indicates that meat supplies were
abundant. The disposal of potential sources of fat
such as marrow and bone grease is evidence that
food, especially fat and starches, was plentiful
during the time the bone bed was deposited. This
abundant food was used by the missionaries to
encourage the Native Americans to enter and to
stay in the mission.

The Spanish Colonial Acequias
of San Antonio

I. Waynne Cox

ABSTRACT

The Spanish acequias, or irrigating ditches, constructed in the San Antonio River valley had a major impact
upon both the development and physical layout of the city. The paths of the acequia were primarily responsible
for the pattern of growth within the city, as well as its wandering roadways. I present a brief history of the
development and growth of the missions in San Antonio and their irrigating systems, as well as the basic
principles of their construction.

San Antonio has long been referred to as unique
among American cities; one reason for this uniqueness is its Spanish heritage. The more visible symbols of this heritage are its five individual missions.
However, there is an Hispanic contribution to San
Antonio, now largely forgotten, that in many ways
had a more dynamic impact upon the very fabric of
the city, the acequia system. These wandering waterways made the missions possible, predetermined
her seemingly random thoroughfares, dictated her
settlement and growth patterns, and affected the
lifestyle of the community until well into the 20th
century. From its very conception the city of San
Antonio has been irreversibly linked with the wealth
of water from the Edward Aquifer. This aquifer,
pulsing throughout the porous limestone below, is
the source of the abundant springs that first attracted the indigenous natives, and later the Spanish, to induce man to call it a home for a continuous
period in excess of 10,000 years.
The primary consideration of the Spanish was
the relocation of these waters to those areas that
would allow them to settle and occupy this fertile
valley to their best advantage. The streams were
conveyed across the land by diversion ditches called
acequias. The courses of the acequias were dictated by the contours of the land, ever seeking a
lower level. But this decrease must conform to a
specific grade; too steep and the ditches would overflow and erode away their containment channels.

Too shallow and the water would not produce sufficient flow to water its vital crops and would well
up in stagnant pools. The acequiadors, canal makers, were generally expert in achieving this proper
gradient; but just how they managed to engineer
the miles of waterways is not recorded. Several
theories have been advanced, varying from an equilateral triangle and plumb bob, a wine bottle half
filled with water, to pure trial and error of opening
a trench and following the flow. While this paints a
colorful picture of the early settlers attempting to
learn the essence of hydrology by trial and error, it
is probably far from realistic. The essential principal of redirecting water for use had been established and published by Marcus Vitnrius Pollio as
early as the first century before the Christian era.
Hero of Alexandria, Greek engineer and mathematician, he later invented the dioptra, a device for
measuring both vertical and horizontal angles adjusted by turning screws that engaged sprockets.
Fitted with some water-filled glass tubes for leveling, it became an all-purpose instrument and a forerunner of the modem theodolite. This technology
was not greatly improved by the 18th century
(Hauck 1988:43-45). By whatever manner they created the acequias, they were extremely successful,
for these waterways fulfilled their intended purposes
with only minor alterations for more than 270 years.
The paths of the acequias caused the resultant
fields that they nurtured to vary in area, dictating

that if division of lands were to be distributed in an
equitable manner, the drawing of lots or chances
determined the recipient's suerte or luck. The roads
and paths through the villa and to the missions
followed the winding waterways, creating what later
evolved into street patterns that failed to conform
to a more logical grid pattern. The later division of
lands and the development of the irregularly shaped
plots created many of the unusually shaped buildings and curious orientation of many downtown
blocks that add to the quaintness of the city. The
growth of the city developed not toward the cardinal directions but along the canals that served to
provide agricultural and landscape imgation, as well
as drinking water. San Antonio's bountiful springs
provided the impetus for its founding, but the
acequias allowed for its growth and development.
Canal irrigation is a system of transporting water from a source by means of gravity through artificially constructed open canals. An acequia is often
thought of as merely a ditch to convey water from
one point to another. While this is essentially true,
in actual function it is much more complex and
requires a complexity of components and controls.
The first is a device to contain and direct the water
into the channel; this is usually accomplished by
means of a diversion dam. A diversion dam, in
contrast to a storage dam, does not impound water,
but merely raises the level of a water source to
allow it to be directed toward the withdrawal channel, and excess water is allowed to flow over the
top without the use of floodgates or spillways. The
principal channel is referred to as the acequia
madre, or mother ditch. Near the point where the
water is directed from the stream channel, a head
gate is installed to control the flow into the madre.
At the point where the flow is needed to irrigate the
fields, distribution canals are constructed with the
flow controlled by sluice gates. Often desagues, or
discharge channels, are required to control flooding
and excess flow. If the channel must pass over an
obstacle, such as a stream or another acequia, an
elevated structure, an aqueduct, is constructed to
carry the flow over the obstruction. This can often
be as simple as a canoa, a hollowed-out log, or as
complex as the massive stone structure such as still
functions near Mission Espada. Once the water
reaches the field, it is distributed through field channels into the various agricultural plots by furrows.
Another attribute of the acequia is that after it has
been made accessible to all the required users, it

must return to a primary source, usually the parent
stream from which it originated. While this is often
viewed as a conservation technique, it is instead a
basic principle of acequia operation.
The water laws developed in the New World
were a composite of Spanish laws, the new environment, and the interaction of both. The other
colonial powers, England, France, and Holland,
were generally conditioned to deal with an exccess
of moisture, however, their primary concern was
land; they were more concerned with water as a
source of power and cheap transportation. Spain,
by dint of her heritage of an arid environment, was
obsessed with water as well as land; therefore, she
brought with her colonies detailed and established
regulations in the distribution and use of this essential commodity. Their land grants address the
allowances of water because the amount of land to
be allotted depended on the area that could be
irrigated.The standard dula, or allowance, specified in the deed records of San Antonio is onehalf day of water. In fact, the standard grant
actually specifies the amount of water allowed
"with the corresponding lands" (con su tierra
correspediente) (Land Grants and Sales, Bexar
County Archives). This same system of planting
is still the basic pattern observed today in the
fields of the Espada Ditch Company, the only
colonial acequia still in operation.
On April 9, 1718, Governor Don Martin de
Alarcon, accompanied by Fray Olivares and seven
families of settlers crossed the Rio Grande. Because of disagreements between the Governor and
the priest, they traveled separately but arrived at
the San Antonio River on April 25th. Father
Olivares explored the vicinity and independently
founded a mission, San Antonio de Valero, " ... near
the first spring [San PedroJ half a league from a
high ground and adjoining a small thicket of live
oaks" (Hoffman 1938:43). Shortly thereafter he
moved the mission to the east bank of the river,
south of its present location. On May 5, 1718,
Alarcon established the Villa de Bejar, near San
Pedro Springs, named in honor of the brother of the
Viceroy. The first acequias in the San Antonio
valley were begun shortly afterward. While there
have been many acequias, of varying length and
importance, within the rich historic past of the city,
the seven major Spanish acequias have had the
most profound effect and will be addressed in this
narrative (Figure 1).

Figure 1. The Seven Major Spanish Acequias of the San Antonio River valley.

The acequia for the Villa de Bejar would have
been established in close proximity to the settlement and would logically have drawn upon the
abundant waters of the spring as its source. The
land above the springs rose sharply, with the lands
to the south offering the only lands to serve as
fields for the settlers.
As is usually the case, the archival records fail
to indicate the location selected for the presidio's
new acequia; however, in this case there is the
Aguayo map (Figure 2). This map, reputedly produced by the Marques de Aguayo for Viceroy
Casafuente in 1729, has been dismissed as "charming" but "inaccurate in scale and geographic features" (Schuetz 1966:4-5, 1968:11). It has further
been criticized because it places the loop of the
river on the wrong side, the confluence of San
Pedro Creek and the river incorrectly, the presidio

irrigation system incorrectly, and Mission San Jose
on the wrong side of the river (de la Teja 1996:54).
However, if viewed as a representation of the
area as it appeared when last viewed by Aguayo
upon his departure in 1722, an entirely different
interpretation can be made of the map. A comparison of the area from below the springs to the
confluence of the creek and river shows a direct
correlation of features (Figure 3). Although the river
is clearly not depicted in correct detail, San Pedro
Creek is represented in a realistic manner, and the
loop of the river can be identified as the portion
above the horseshoe bend, now identified as the
Riverwalk, that does project toward the west. This
indicates that the presidio acequia emanated from
the first major bend of the creek, then curved to the
southwest to return to the river near the beginning
of the river bend. If we consider the present street

where an acequia could easily draw water from the
abundance of the springs. He had already selected
an ideal location. On his first visit, with the Aguirre
expedition in 1709, he had noted the numerous
springs that formed the headwaters of the river and
knew that those waters could be easily tapped near
the ford just below their confluence, the Paso de
Tejas, on the road to the eastern missions. Fray
Mesquia, in his journal, recounted that the first
week in May 1719 was devoted to excursions to
examine the area, and a site had been located at a
"ford of the San Antonio River, about a fourth of a
league" that was ideal to draw water for an acequia.
He cautions that a "good deal" of work would be
involved, for the lands selected for the new location
"are a league and a half distant [3.9 miles]. The
water rises to the top of the ground and the entire
work is a matter of using a plow" (Hoffman
1938:317-318). He further describes the future location as extensive and level, enclosed on one side
by the river and on the other by low hills.
The acequia emanated from a diversion dam
that sprang from the west bank of the river and
extended into the stream to raise and direct the flow
toward the eastern bank where the canal intake was

located. The acequia then traced a sinuous path,
between the river and the low hills to the east,
toward the south-southwest, to pass through the
mission grounds to return to the river at the largest
bend, creating a ditch approximately three and onehalf miles in length. Later additions to the channel,
branching near the mission and irrigating additional
labores or farm lands to the east and south, would
extend the total length of the acequia to approximately 10 miles.
On October 15, 1727, Fray Miguel Sevillano de
Paredes visited the mission and reported their
progress. He noted that the clerics had established
" ... a little fortification (torreonsillo) two gunshots
(dos tiros, approximately 300 yards) ... from its
present location" (Paredes 1727), but everything had
been destroyed by a humcane in 1724, at which time
it was moved. He reported that the acequia was still
one league (2.63 miles) from the mission, and " ... the
entire project was an arduous one, since it was carried out solely by using crowbars" (Paredes 1727).
He further commented that the work had been repeatedly delayed by the need to protect the struggling mission from Apache attacks, requiring them
to discontinue work on the acequia and fortify their

320

Texas Archeological Society

quarters. Because of the importance of completing
the acequia, work on the stone church had not begun, but stone had been selected and they were awaiting the arrival of a master craftsman. It is known that
one of the officers accompanying Governor Alarcon
was Captain Barreiro y Alvarez, a member of the
Royal Corps of Engineers, and official engineer
for the expedition (Fireman 1977 :54). It can, therefore, be assumed that the actual planning for the
placement of the acequia was under his direction.
In 1718, Spain found herself at war against a
European alliance, including her arch enemy,
France. Military operations between the two
countries began in January 1719 and ended in
February of the following year. During that period,
France made engagement against the East Texas
settlement, forcing their withdrawal. Among the
refugees were the eight fathers from the evacuated
missions. One of the priests, Fray Antonio Margil
de Jesus, who founded in 1706 the College of
Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Zacatecas, viewed
this as an opportunity to advance the needs of his
college. He had encountered three groups of Indians
who desired mission life but could not tolerate the
group living at Valero. To accommodate them he
resolved to found another mission farther down the
river. Fray Margil wrote an impassioned letter to
the new viceroy, in December 1719, stating the
requirement for a new mission as well as the
imperative needs of the Zacatecan friars for their
own halfway mission in the San Antonio valley.
Father Olivares, of Mission Valero, viewed this a
definite infringement upon the lands he had selected
for his mission, but his objections were ignored.
Perhaps the main reason that Father Margi! had so
readily been granted his wishes on the matter of the
new mission, was that he had tactfully suggested
that it would be named after new Governor Aguayo.
At any rate, on February 23, 1720, Lieutenant
General Captain Juan Valdez, accompanied by
Father Margil and an official party, arrived at a site
"where water can be drained from the San Antonio
River to irrigate the land" and "went down river
following the direction where the irrigation ditch is
to be." They selected a site where
the land offered such rich pastures and
plentiful woods for beams, quarry stones,
and firewood. There are excellent exits
and entrances along the river for the
cattle, sheep, goats and horses.

Having satisfied all involved that this was a suitable
location, the Mission San Jose y San Miguel de
Aguayo was established (Leutenegger and Habig
1977a). This later became known as the "Queen
of the Missions," and proved to be one of the most
successful of the San Antonio complex. However,
the acequia described was for the initial site, not
its present location.
The acequia for the final, and present site, of
San Jose issued from the river eight-tenths of a
mile south of Concepcion, and just above a ford of
the river for the mission road crossing. The dam
was constructed approximately 1400 feet below the
confluence of San Pedro Creek and the river, jutting upstream, to divert the water to a headgate
located on the west bank. From there, the channel
followed land contours southward to pass to the
west of the mission compound. After passing the
mission, it veered slightly to the east to return to the
river just north of the Espada dam. In approximately 1790, the molina, or mill, was constructed
to the north of the church, and the acequia was
diverted north of the mission to provide power for
the operation. The channel then skirted the east
wall of the compound to rejoin the old channel
south of the mission to return to the river. The total
length of the madre was approximately three miles.
With the appointment of Juan de Acuna,
Marques de Casafuente, as viceroy in October 1722,
King Philip V charged him to conduct a survey of
the frontier to evaluate the defenses and instigate
necessary reforms. In 1724, Brigadier General Pedro
de Rivera y Villalon, former governor of Tlaxcala,
was dispatched by the viceroy to accomplish this
formidable task (Weddle 1968: 172). The tour lasted
until June 1728, and covered more than 8,000 miles.
Among his recommendations was the reduction of
the East Texas garrisons and the relocation of the
three Queretaran missions to new sites on the
Colorado River, near present-day Austin. Viceroy
Casafuente, acting on the recommendations, reduced
the presidios and moved the missions in July 1730.
That location was not acceptable to Father Paredas,
the guardian of the college, and the missions were
again moved to the San Antonio River basin on
March 5, 1731. Nuestra Senora de la Purisima
Concepcion de los Hainai became Nuestra Senora
de la Purisima Concepcion de Acuna, and was
located between San Antonio de Valero and the
new site of San Jose y San Miguel. San Jose de los
Nazonis, now San Juan Capistrano, and San

Cox Francisco de los Neches, now San Francisco de
Espada, were assigned lands farther to the south.
The Concepcion, or Pajalache, acequia, as
previously stated, was probably in existence before
the new mission was built. The channel began on
the east side of the river at a rather large dam that
spanned a point just above the town's major ford at
Presa (Spanish for dam) Street. Because the entry
point was at La Villita (the little village), one of the
highest points in the downtown area, it required a
massive cut to initiate a downward flow. The
Concepcion acequia was always noted as the largest
of the ditches, so large in fact that it was reported
that the fathers kept a boat on it to attend to its
cleaning (Comer 1890:44). It was certainly large
enough at the inlet point, for the width was reported
as 20 feet (San Antonio Express 1913). It progressed
southward along the west side of the road to the
lower missions, to a point 2500 feet from the intake,
to where a canoa, or hollow log, transported a later
extension of the Alamo madre over the canal on its
return to the river. This was later replaced, probably
during the mid-1800s, by a "substantial arched stone
aqueduct" extant in 1890 (Comer 1890:43). It then
progressed along the road to the mission compound,
where it diverted westward to return to the river
south of the confluence of San Pedro Creek. The
original acequia had a total length of approximately
3.3 miles. In later times a double gate was installed
1.4 miles from the intake. and an eastern branch
was constructed to irrigate additional farm lands,
adding another two miles to its length. Before the
acequia was abandoned, it consisted of more than
7.5 miles of ditches.
The acequia for Mission San Juan Capistrano
was probably begun about the time that the first
huts were constructed on May 4, 1731, but progress
on the mission, and probably its acequia, was slow
during the first 10 years due to frequent Apache
raids, obstructionist tactics of Governor Franquis
de Lugo, and an epidemic in 1739 (Habig
1968:164). However, the acequia was in operation
by February 1740, for the fields were reported as
newly planted in the spring of that year, and a
report by Fray Fernandez de Santa Ana comments
on the "five very abundant withdrawals from the
river" (Leutenegger 1968). The dam that serviced
the acequia was constructed along the west bank of
the river, almost directly opposite the present site
of Mission San Jose, and was approximately 300
feet in length and projected downstream, diverting

The Spanish Colonial Acequias of San Antonio

321

the flow to the deep intake located on the east bank.
Approximately 550 feet down the acequia, a stone
headgate was constructed to control the flow. The
channel continued slightly more than three miles
southward on the east side of the river to the mission. An eastern branch to irrigate later fields added
an additional 2.6 miles of canals.
The acequia for Mission San Francisco de
Espada began at a dam spanning the river, midway
between missions San Jose and San Juan, diverting
water into a channel along the western side of the
river. This dam, the last of the functioning Spanish
colonial dams, is constructed of limestone and lime
mortar, and arches downstream of the river flow.
At a point 1.49 miles down the acequia, it became
necessary to construct an aqueduct to convey the
water over Piedras (Six-Mile) Creek; it remains as
the only surviying stone aqueduct. It was described
in 1772 as a
... conduit of lime and stone of thirtyeight varas [105.5 feet] in length; six
[16.6 feet] in height; with its diamond
point, and two arches, which allow
the currents of said creek to pass ...
(Saenz 1772).
The diamond point referred to is the pointed projection of the central pier that diverted the pressure of the stream away from the support for the
two arches. The acequia continues south to the
mission and below for a total length of approximately 3.25 miles.
Another of the recommendation of Brigadier
General Rivera was that the frontier be settled with
stable families, believing that "one permanent Spanish family would do more to hold the country than
a hundred soldiers" (Chabot 1937:141). King Philip
V turned to the Canary Islands to provide the emigrant families for New Spain. On March 9, 1731,
56 Islanders arrived at the presidio to form the
nucleus of the Villa of San Fernando de Bexar, the
first civil settlement of Texas. Viceroy Casafuente
had ordered that the newcomers be greeted and
housed in the presidio until the villa was established a " ... gunshot's distance ... to the west of the
presidio" (Aviles 1726-1731). The Captain of the
Presidio, Juan Antonio Perez de Alamazan, delayed
the laying out of the villa until after the planting
season, selecting "land subject to irrigation" as temporary fields for the Islanders, and selected a site
east of the presidio instead. In order to do this, it

322

Texas Archeological Society

was necessary that he usurp the fields presently
being farmed by the presidio families. Alamazan
had selected the fertile area to the south of the villa
between the river and the creek down to the
confluence of the streams for the permanent fields
for the Islanders.
Each family was consigned a plot sufficient to
plant their crops. As previously noted by Celiz, the
banks of the two streams were deep enough in this
area to make irrigation difficult; therefore, an
acequia was envisioned to begin from San Pedro
Springs proceeding southward between the water
courses to return to the river just prior to the
confluence. This design presented two distinct
advantages; first, it could service the barrio del
norte, the presidio and the villa, as well as the
Islander's fields; secondly, by following the high
ground between the two water courses, it could
irrigate lands on both sides, in contrast to the other
acequias that watered only the lands toward the
river. The date establishing the beginning and
completion is not recorded, but it is logical to
assume that construction was initiated soon after
assignment of the land. On January 11, 1734, by
order of the viceroy, the lands were re-surveyed
and official title was granted to the Islanders. Excess
land was also granted to eight other citizens of the
villa (Leal 1986). In all probability, the acequia
was in operation by this time. With the completion
of the San Pedro acequia, the entire basin between
the creek and the river could now be irrigated from
the area of the springs to the confluence of the two
streams. The channel was approximately four miles
in length and watered approximately 400 acres
below the villa, the new lands of the Islanders and
other citizens.
It has been stated that the arrival, in 1773, of
the relocated persons from another withdrawal of
the citizens from East Texas, the Adaesanos,
prompted the demand for another acequia to make
available the irrigable lands to the north of the
villa (Buck 1980:244-245). However, the demands
for such an acequia were of long standing. In fact,
the permission for an additional acequia had been
granted in 1733. In August 1762, a group of 13
citizens petitioned the governor for land and water
to be distributed as had been previously ordained.
In their request, they claimed that "about the year
of forty-five" the viceroy had ordered this of his
predecessor, but for reasons unknown, he had
failed to comply. The governor, Angel de Martos

y Navarrete, agreed that the request was valid and
directed Geronimo Flores, who was "skillful in
withdrawing water," to measure the lands proposed
for the acequia. Flores reported that a channel
could be constructed from a point on the river
5853 varas (three miles) north of the villa that
would pass through five thousand varas (4428.4
acres) of irrigable land. The only obstruction that
presented itself was a stretch of 150 varas (416.6
feet) "across the brow of the hill which is called
Loma de la Vieja" (now Tobin Hill). He further
noted that it would require a dam of 35 varas
(97.2 feet), 25 of them (69.4 feet) two and threequarters varas in height (7 .6 feet), and the
remaining 10 (27.8 feet) of one and one-half varas
(4.2 feet). He estimated the cost of the dam and
canal at 3,000 pesos (BAT 1762). The governor
fully agreed with the proposal and submitted it to
the viceroy, but for unrecorded reasons, the plan
was not put into effect.
Fourteen years later, the citizens would again
petition the governor, Baron de Ripperda, for the
additional land and water. The reason for this
renewal of interest may have arisen from the fact
that the villa was in the depth of a severe drought
that began in 1771 and lasted for six years (Gunn et
al. 1982:70). The governor, well aware of the
volatile nature of the various factions of the villa,
approached the proposal with a full awareness of
the need of his diplomatic skills. On January 10,
1776, he addressed the citizens of the villa, stating
that "there will be found in the archives of this
province, two orders from the Sir Viceroy Marquez
de Casafuente, of December 10, 1731 and March
12, 1733, distributing the waters of the two springs
of San Pedro and San Antonio and that of the five
missions adjoining this presidio and village." He
then noted that the governor, Antonio Bustillos,
commissioned Lieutenant Governor Matheo Perez
to give possession of a saca de agua above the
Paso de Tejas out of the San Antonio river to the
residents of the village on October 27, 1733 (BCA,
Vol. 3, p. 317). He then requested that "all Canary
Island settlers as well as all the rest of the
inhabitants ... in order to avoid in future all motives
of discord," and present any documents that "may
prove in their favor" within four days (Corner
1890:46). Upon receiving no valid complaints from
this quarter, he then addressed a similar letter to
Fray Pedro Ramires, president of the missions,
inquiring if this would adversely impact the

Cox -

The Spanish Colonial Acequias of San Antonio

missions. The padre replied that he did not think
that the missions would be injured by the building
of the ditch (BCA, Volume 3, p. 318).
Having satisfied himself that neither the villagers nor the clergy had a strong protest against the
project, he then ordered that by January 29, all
resident Islanders and others present
themselves before me, and those who
wish to contribute to said ditch, therefore
after having enlisted themselves, to commence same, each to commence with one
peon and the necessary tools.
He then specified that distributions of the lands
would be made by suertes with its corresponding
one day of water to each of the participants. The
construction of the ditch was to be placed in charge
of an "able man of experience" (BCA, Volume 3,
pp. 318-319). The shareholders met on July 13,
1776, and elected Angel Galin to supervise the four
peon and 26 men "who are to work daily on said
ditch." Thoribio Fuentes was placed in charge of
the actual construction. For this they agreed to pay
Galin a peso per day "until the madre and other
necessary ditches" were finished, while Fuentes was
allotted an additional portion of land (BCA, Volume 3, pp. 322-324).
By April 28, 1777, the acequia had reached the
midpoint of its construction; therefore, in order to
place the ditch in operation for the planting season,
the ditch was returned to the river, and a drawing
was held to distribute the first 26 suertes. The governor then called all officials of the presidio, missions, and villa together for the drawing of the
suertes. The names of the shareholders were placed
in a brass urn and sealed, the numbers of the suertes
were then placed in a like urn and sealed, and then
"two boys of tender age" proceeded to draw one
ticket, alternately, from each urn to select the property holders (BCA, Volume 3, pp. 325-332).
By March 1778, the remaining portion of the
acequia was finished, "draining into the San Pedro
Creek by a trough ... so that the residents located on
the other side may avail themselves of its excess,"
and the drawing procedure was repeated to distribute the remaining suertes of land. One exception
was that Francisco Xavier Rodriquez did not take
part in the drawing for he had agreed to take a
suerte and one half to the north of the ditch (BCA,
Volume 3, p. 327). Thus, by March 10, 1778, the

323

acequia was complete and the remaining irrigated
portions of land had been distributed.
The acequia was constructed as envisioned by
Geronimo Flores in 1762. The dam was erected on
the west bank of the river at the "Paso de Tejas,"
now Hildebrand Avenue, and the water supplied by
the group of springs to the west of the main spring
feeding the river. The portion first constructed,
between July 1776 and April 1777, progressed along
land contours toward the southwest to a point at the
present intersection of Evergreen Court and North
St. Mary's Street, where it returned to the river near
the intersection of St. Mary's Street and Ninth
Street, a length of almost three miles.
With the completion of the Upper Labor
acequia, the last major construction period for
acequias under the Spanish ended. However, the
fruit of their efforts continued to serve the growing
and changing city. Through the years the same
ditches served the population under the flags of
Spain, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the Confederacy, and the United States of America. They
served as the sole source of drinking water for the
city until the municipal water system was established in the 1870s, and they continued to supply
the citizens with garden irrigation until the first
decade of the 20th century when they became an
expensive luxury for the taxpayers and the downtown acequias were closed and filled. The downtown portions of the Alamo and San Pedro acequias
now functioned only in those portions that had been
adapted as storm drains. The San Juan and Espada
systems continued to perform their function, but
their relationship to the other systems was known
to only a few. The rich heritage of the acequias had
slipped from the public consciousness.
Although the acequias no longer flow through
the streets of the city or supply the population
with its source of water, they are still very much a
part of the fabric of the city and a vital element in
understanding the history of San Antonio. At
present only the Espada acequia performs the function for which it was designed 250 years ago.
Soon the old San Juan acequia will be restored
and again water the demonstration farm of the
mission, another element of the National Park Service interpretive program.
Is there a requirement, or need, for further work
on the old waterways? The answer is most certainly
a positive one. There are still unanswered question
and buried resources that have not been exposed.

Texas Archeological Society

Beneath the surface of one of the city's busiest
intersections, St. Mary's and South Alamo, lies
buried the remains of a major stone aqueduct that
was still visible as late as 1890 (Cox 1995). Another, most probably of stone, reposes buried and
forgotten just to the east of the Five-points intersection. One of the major reasons that San Antonio has become such a popular tourist and a
convention destination is the rich cultural history
it displays. The further addition of the story of the
acequias can only enhance this experience for the
visitors, as well as our own citizens. At present
only fragments of the acequia are present in the
downtown area to tell the story, such as can be
seen at the Alamo, HemisFair Park, Brackenridge
Park, the Justice Center, and the San Antonio
Housing Authority. Recently, during the planning
for the Downtown Hampton Inn, the acequia was
incorporated into the landscape area behind the
building (Renner 1997). While these allow small
windows into this rich history, there is no single
location where the story can be told in its entirety.
This rich history should be preserved for future
generations in order to allow them a complete
picture of their heritage and the little waterways
that helped shape their city.

Archeological Investigations at Area I,
the Cabasefio Ranch (41ZP79),
Falcon Reservoir

ABSTRACT

Area I at the Cabasefio Ranch site (41ZP79) is a ca. 1775-1800 Spanish Colonial settlement along the lower
Rio Grande. It is normally inundated by the waters of Falcon Reservoir, but archeological investigations
conducted in 1996 and 1998 when the site was exposed during record low water levels have documented a small
rancho with three structures, two pits filled with animal bones, and a midden with majolica, an assortment of
lead-glazed wares, and a wide variety of hand-made and wheel-thrown coarse earthenwares.

INTRODUCTION
Much of what is known about Spanish Colonial archeology in Texas is based principally on a
long history of 20th century investigations at mission and presidio sites in centers of Spanish civil
and religious settlement, such as San Antonio and
environs, Goliad, Nacogdoches, and San Augustine (see Fox, this volume). We have learned a
great deal about the lives of the missionaries, soldiers, and Native American converts in these
places, much that was never documented in the
historical records and archives of the Spanish bureaucracy. Nevertheless, this emphasis of archeology on the civil and religious sites, important as it
is, does not tell the whole story of Spanish Colonial life in Texas and, in fact, overlooks the historical importance of the early ranching sites and
communities in the colonization and settlement of
the state (cf. Tijerina 1998). At the Cabasefio
Ranch site (41ZP79), the subject of this article,
we have a rare archeological glimpse of an early
ranching settlement along the north bank of the
lower Rio Grande, in one of the heartlands of
Tejano ranching (see Jackson 1986:443-450).
The Cabasefio Ranch site was one of 40 historic
archeological sites dating between the late 18th

century and 1950 that were recorded and studied
during the 1996 Na ti on al Park Service-Texas
Historical Commission-Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at
Austin site assessment effort at Falcon Reservoir
(Perttula et al. 1996). It is situated amidst several
other ranching sites in a north-south stretch of the
Rio Grande, a few miles above the small community
ofLopeno (Figure 1), and a few miles downstream
from Zapata Viejo.
Subsequent archeological survey by
McCullough and Warren (1998) across Falcon Reservoir have documented more than 110 historic archeological sites, including ranches with stone and
wood structural ruins, cemeteries, wells, dipping
vats, troughs, quarries, and corrals. However, Area
I at the Cabasefio site is one of the earliest Hispanic
colonial ranching sites identified to date at Falcon
Reservoir; apparently contemporaneous ranchos
were investigated at the Falcon Reservoir dam in
the early 1950s (Krieger and Hughes 1950; Hartle
and Stephenson 1951).
The ceramics from this component of the
Cabasefio site contain only majolicas, lead-glazed
wares, and a variety of coarse earthenwares, and
British or European ceramics or bottle glass are
notably absent. The Tejano ranching sites along the

lower Rio Grande dating after ca.
1820/1830, by contrast, contain
abundant British-made whitewares
and many lead-glazed ceramics, a
trend noted on Hispanic archeological sites elsewhere in Texas, the
Southwest, and California (cf. Fox
1992; Cohen-Williams and Williams
1996). Based on the recovery of
Puebla Blue on white II majolica,
San Elizario Polychrome, Puebla
Green on white, Aranama Polychrome, and Huejotzingo Blue on
white majolica, the ranching settlement at Area I appears to date between ca. 1775-1800.
The Cabasefio Ranch is situated on the Zapata terrace (Evans
1962), a Holocene-aged alluvial deposit that parallels the now-inundated channel of the Rio Grande. It
ranges in elevation from ca. 250255 feet amsl, and is normally inundated by 46-51 feet of water when
the Falcon Reservoir conservation
pool is full. The Arroyo Cabasefio
enters the Rio Grande a short distance downstream from the site, creating a southward-facing terrace
landform between the arroyo and the
Rio Grande.

CULTURAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL
SETTING: HISPANIC AND TEJANO
ARCHEOLOGY ALONG THE
LOWER RIO GRANDE
The historic archeological sites present at Falcon Reservoir represent the remains of 18th to 20th
century Hispanic and Tejano ranching communities along the lower Rio Grande (George 1975;
Tijerina 1994, 1998; Poyo 1996; Alonzo 1998).
These communities on the north side or bank of the
Rio Grande were established after 1750, following
Jose de Escandon' s colonization efforts in the province of Nuevo Santander (Thompson 1997: 19-24),
which extended from Tampico, Mexico on the
south, Matagorda Bay on the north, the Sierra Madre
Oriental to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the
east (Gerhard 1993). The largest river in the prov-

ince, the Rio Grande, ran through the center of the
province (Figure 2). The 1750 ranching community
ofNuestra Senora de los Dolores in northern Zapata
County was the "first settlement in Nuevo Santander
on the north bank of the Rio Grande in what is now
South Texas" (Thompson 1997:27).
The Colonial Hispanic ranching and agrarian
communities quickly developed along the Rio
Grande and took on great importance as a major
ranching area, despite its relatively late 18th century occupation compared with inland and coastal
mission and civil settlements in Texas that were
established in the first quarter of the 18th century
(cf. Jones 1996). By 1830, there were 241 Tejano
ranches in the Rio Grande region, and this had
increased to 356 ranches by 1833 (Tijerina
1994:Table 7).
The Rio Grande area was one of the centers
of Hispanic cattle ranching in North America, taking shape from Mexican Gulf coastal (Tamaulipan)
culture and ranching/herding practices extending

Area I at the Cabasefio site was located in the general area of the "Ranchos de Revilla."

back to about 1650 (Jordan 1993:147-156 and
Figure 27). This area had large herds of feral
cattle and horses, which proved to be a boon to
the eventual development of the cattle ranching
industry. Associated with the spread of cattle
ranching/herding to the lower Rio Grande were
distinctive systems of private land ownership (large
Royal grants or porciones), unsupported by either
the military or missionaries, use of a vaquero (cowboy) work force, and an architectural expression
in houses and public buildings that reflected the
climate of the region and available materials, including wood, stone, clay, and grass/branches
(Robinson 1979; Graham 1994, 1997; Fleming
1998). Jones (1996:78) succinctly captures the essence of the Hispanic and Tejano populations that
colonized the lower Rio Grande valley:
These settlers were not great landowners
or members of any aristocratic group.

They were mostly small farmers and
ranchers, artisans, day laborers, and occasionally merchants. Their society not
only held this frontier for Spain, but established a Spanish-speaking nucleus of
population for southern Texas and
Tamaulipas. Their emphasis upon raising large numbers of livestock near the
Rio Grande became the basis of the huge
Texas cattle industry that developed after the Civil War in the United States.
The historic archeological ranching sites and
communities at Falcon Reservoir "were selected
with cares, with consideration toward good terrace
soil, firewood, shade-trees, and available water"
(George 1975 :20). The earliest ranches and
communities appear to have been situated on
alluvial terraces adjacent to low water crossings or
fords of the Rio Grande, as at Nuestra Senora de los
Dolores (later named Dolores Viejo, but established

330

Texas Archeological Society

in 17 50 by Jose Vasquez Borrego), Lopefi.o
(established after the 1761 land grant to Ysabel
Marfa Sanchez) and Falcon (established ca. 1781
by Don Jose Ramirez and Rita de la Garza Falcon).
Late 18th to mid-19th century archeological sites
with stone structure ruins are also common in the
vicinity of the Santa Rosa ford of the Rio Grande
(near the confluence of Arroyo Cabasefio), including
the Cabaseiio (41ZP79) and Santa Rosa Ford
(41ZP302) sites, and on alluvial terraces where a
major arroyo enters the Rio Grande valley.
These ca. 1780-1860 ranching sites were probably in ruins at the time of Emory's 1852-1853
survey of the Rio Grande (Emory 1987:Map No.
1). Emory's map shows a "Deserted Rancho" and a
"stone Rancho (in ruins)" between present-day Arroyo Loma Blanca and Arroyo del Tigre, in the
vicinity of the Santa Rosa Ford as shown on the
1929 15' USGS maps of the Falcon Reservoir area.
These sites contain the sandstone ruins and foundations of ranch structures, homos or outdoor stone
baking ovens, trash pits and bone-filled middens,
and extensive trash midden deposits containing
Mexican majolica types common in northern New
Spain between ca. 1780-1850 (Cohen-Williams
1992; Cohen-Williams and Williams 1996; Fox
1992). Also present are Mexican lead-glazed wares,
locally-made coarse earthenware jars and ollas (labeled Mier Plain by Alex Krieger from ceramic
sherds and partial vessels recovered from 41SR39
and 41 SR43 at Falcon Reservoir [Krieger and
Hughes 1950; Hartle and Stephenson 1951]), British and European ceramics, liquor and medicine
bottles, metal implements and tools, and an assortment of other kinds of material goods obtained
from Mexican, American, and European sources.
Some of the earliest identified Hispanic
ranching sites and ruins (as at Area I at Cabasefio,
see below, and the Santa Rosa Ford site) contain
roughly rectangular rock foundations (one or two
courses in height) rather than the thick stonewalled and flat-roofed or pitched-roof structures
also common along the Rio Grande in the Falcon
Reservoir area (see George 1975; Fleming 1998).
These rock foundations may have had adobe walls
and thatched roofs (John W. Clark, 1998 personal communication). Others of wood probably
represent the foundations for wood post jacales,
the walls having been composed of vertical mesquite posts covered with adobe plaster and with a
wood roof framework thatched over with saw

grass or tule (George 1975; Graham 1997). In
other cases, early 19th century archeological deposits with preserved middens and features have
been identified along the Falcon Reservoir shoreline, but no stone structure ruins or other rock
features were apparent. It is likely that the structural remains of these particular early ranching
communities are either buried in alluvial deposits (and/or buried under recently deposited reservoir silts) or remain inundated.

SITE INVESTIGATIONS
Investigations at the Cabaseiio Ranch site in
1996 and 1998 primarily consisted of mapping and
photographing features and artifact concentrations,
along with the systematic collection of late 18th
and 19th century artifacts (including ceramics, bottle
glass, and metal items) on the exposed shoreline
(Figure 3). During the surface collection, all plain
and decorated majolicas, lead-glazed wares, and
coarse earthenware sherds in Area I were collected,
while in the other areas of the site, decorated refined earthenwares and bottle glass lips were also
collected for analysis (see Perttula et al. 1996;
Perttula et al. 1998). Visibility was excellent along
the recently exposed beach, which facilitated the
surface collections, but a few shallow shovel tests
(ca. 40 x 50 cm in size) were excavated at Cabasefio
in 1998 to ascertain if buried archeological deposits
and features remained there.
The Cabasef\o site has been periodically
occupied since the late 18th century, and the last
occupation (associated with Features 13-17, a corral,
two collapsed jacales, a two room pier structure,
and a midden deposit) dates to the early part of the
20th century. The most substantial settlement at
Cabasefio dates to the mid-19th century, based on
decorated English whiteware and Guanajuato
Polychrome majolica. This settlement included one
large two-room stone structure (Feature 1), two
smaller stone structures (Features 2 and 7), a
possible homo or oven (Feature 3), a lime pit
(Feature 5), and several areas of trash midden
deposits with an abundance of artifacts and animal
bone. Area I, the late 18th century component, is
situated near the northern part of the terrace, and
slightly lower (1-3 feet) in elevation than either the
mid-19th or early 20th century ranchos. It covers at
least 25 x 20 m (see Figure 3), but an unknown

The three stone structures are

Five features have been recognized in Area I

ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGE
Majolica
The majolicas found at the Cabasefio site were
imported from central Mexico (probably from
manufacturing sources such as Puebla, Mexico City,
and Guanajuato ). Their purchase and use by 18th
and 19th century ranchers in the Falcon Reservoir
area hint at broad patterns of commerce and existing
systems of exchange between the local, probably
self-sufficient, Hispanic and Tejano ranching
communities on the lower Rio Grande and the
Mexican mercantile centers.

Texas Archeological Society

In general, the Mexican majolicas at the Falcon Reservoir historic ranching sites appear to be
dominated by Guanajuato wares, which include
majolicas with green, reddish brown, and rust-colored bands, flower petals, and decorative motifs
that became popular in the early 19th century at
Hispanic sites in South Texas (cf. Fox 1992; Carlson
1994), and continued in popularity into the early
20th century (Clark 1989; Cohen-Williams 1992).
At Cabasefio, for example, over 71 percent of the
Mexican majolicas are Guanajuato polychrome
wares, but these majolicas are found exclusively
outside Area I (Perttula et al. 1998). There are also
in general surface collections at the site, small percentages (between 1-5 percent) of Aranama Polychrome {1800-1835), Puebla Green on white
(1780-1800), Huejotzingo Blue on white (17001850, but rare before 1780), Puebla Blue on white
(1700-1850), including a late variant (Puebla Blue
on white II [see Carlson 1994] dating between 17751800), Esquitlan Yellow (1800-1900), Mexico
Green on white ( 1700-1800), and San Elizario Polychrome (1750-1850); the estimated date ranges for
the majolicas follow Carlson (1994).
The same range of Mexican majolicas are
represented in University of Texas collections from
previously investigated Hispanic or Tejano ranching sites at Falcon Reservoir (Krieger and Hughes
1950; Hartle and Stephenson 1951; see also
Goggins 1968), including 41SR39 (two small
plates of Guanajuato polychrome ware), 41SR43
(San Elizario Polychrome, Aranama Polychrome,
and Puebla Blue on white), and a poorly recorded
ranching site between Lopefio and Falcon (with
Huejotzingo Blue on white, Puebla Blue on white,
Aranama Polychrome, and Guanajuato wares). Recent investigations at Corralitos (41ZP74), a few
miles north of San Ygnacio on the Rio Grande,
also recovered the same sort of late 18th century
majolica and other Mexican wares in a midden
deposit apparently associated with the 1780s construction and use of a Casa Fuerte (Fleming and
Perttula, this volume; see also Fleming 1998).
There are only 26 majolica sherds from Area I
at Cabasefio, accounting for 7.3 percent of the ceramics from this component. By comparison, the
308 majolica sherds (principally Guanajuato
polychromes) from other parts of the site comprise
a much higher 13.9 percent of the ceramic assemblage, which is otherwise dominated by Mexican
lead-glazed wares (n=759), coarse earthenwares

(n=550), and decorated English-made whitewares
and yellowwares (n=572). From the differences
between the two assemblages (one late 18th century and the other primarily dating from ca. 18301860), and similar ceramic assemblage data from
several other early and mid-19th century ranchos
at Falcon Reservoir (see Perttula et al. 1998: Table
1), it appears to be the case that the opening of the
Mexican port of Matamoros on the lower Rio
Grande in 1824 for international trade (Alonzo
1998:67-73) led to the introduction of new ceramic wares from England and a broadening of
the ceramic trade within Mexico and border regions and towns. This apparently led to the increased shipment and purchase of more majolica
and lead-glazed wares in the Falcon Reservoir area
by local ranchers after 1824.
The Cabasefio, Area I majolica was made in at
least two source areas in central Mexico, based on
differences in the paste and surface color of the tin
glaze. The principal majolica (accounting for 50
percent of the majolica) has a grayish-white Puebla
paste (cf. Fournier 1997), followed by a majolica
with a reddish-brown paste and a creme-yellow
surface color (31 percent), and a few majolica sherds
with a reddish-brown paste and a creme surface
color. The latter majolica may have been manufactured in Puebla or Guanajuato; the one Guanajuato
polychrome sherd has a reddish-brown paste with a
creme-yellow surface color.
The Puebla paste majolica (n=l3) includes
two plain body sherds, one unidentified sherd with
blue petals, San Elizario Polychrome (n=5) rim,
body, and base sherds with dark blue petals and
dots (Figure 4a, c-d, g), a possible Monterey Polychrome (1775-1825) rim with dark brown, reddish-yellow brown, and brown rim bands (Figure
Se), three Huejotzingo Blue on White rims, including one with a wavy rim band, and each with
blue rim bands on interior and exterior surfaces
(Figure 4e, h), and one Aranama tradition rim/
body sherd with brown, grayish-green, brown, and
blue bands (Figure Sc). Decorated majolica with
the reddish-brown paste and creme-yellow surface color (n=8) comprises an Aranama tradition
base sherd with circular black and green lines (Figure 5b), one base sherd with light blue and dark
blue petals (Figure 4f), a Puebla Blue on White
cup with blue lines and three dots (Figure 4j), a
small rust-brown decorated piece that may be a

rims (Figure 4i), a Huejotzingo Green on White
rim, and one sherd with light green bands (Figure
5d), probably made in Puebla. Finally, the five
majolica sherds with a reddish-brown paste and a
creme surface color are represented by two Puebla
Green on White body and base sherds with dark
green petals (Figure 5a), probably part of the same
vessel, one Huejotzingo Blue on White rim (n=6),
and two San Elizario Polychrome rim sherds (Figure 4b).

Lead-Glazed Wares
The Mexican lead-glazed wares from Area I
are wheel-made vessels with a very fine paste, lead
glazes on interior and exterior surfaces, and several
different kinds of decorations. They have a characteristic orange vessel surface color from having
been well-fired in an oxidizing environment.
A number of the lead-glazed wares are from
post-1750 Galera Polychrome sherds (n=14) from
chocolateras. The sherds are thin-walled (averaging 3.5 mm in thickness, with a range of 2.6-4.8
mm) and have creme-colored bands and dots, black
lines and swirls, as well as green and creme-colored lines and dots on the vessel exterior (Figure
6a-g, i). Five other lead-glazed sherds are probably from bean pots, and include two handles, two
rim sherds (3.6 mm in thickness), and a rim/body
sherd (see Figure 6h). The rim sherds have a brown
painted rim band on the interior of the vessel.
Another 24 sherds are undecorated rim and body
sherds from thin (3.8 Â± 0.7 mm) lead-glazed vessels of undetermined form and with fine pastes.
They have clear, yellow, and brown glazes.

Burnished Red Wares
There are four rim and body sherds of a burnished red ware from Area I, possibly all from a
single bowl with a 22 cm orifice diameter and 7.9
mm thick body walls (Figure 7a-d). The rim is
direct and rounded at the lip. The red ware has a
fine reddish-brown paste, and the sherds are from a
vessel fired in an oxidizing environment. A few
other burnished red ware sherds are present in shovel
tests and surface collections to the east and south of
Area I (see Perttula et al. 1998:Table 1), but they
are found in mid-19th century contexts. One black
glazed ware sherd, or Black Luster probably made

Coarse Earthenwares

Figure 7. Burnished Red Ware Sherds from Area I.

There are three kinds of coarse earthenwares
at Area I in the Cabasefio site: (1) large wheelmade jars, bowls, and ollas with sandy paste and
crushed rock temper; (2) medium-sized to large
jars and bowls of a hand-made earthenware, tempered with shell, bone, or crushed rock; and (3)
olive jars. These earthenwares comprise approximately 80 percent of the ceramics from Area I, but
only 24.8 percent of the ceramic sherds from the
mid-19th century or later components at Cabasefio
(Perttula et al. 1998:Table 1).

Figure 9. Rim Profiles, Coarse Earthenware: a-e, handmade coarse earthenware; f-k, wheel-made coarse

There are 91 rim, body, and base sherds of
wheel-made coarse earthenwares in Area I. The
vessels are large jars, bowls (Figure Sb), and ollas,
with rounded lips and everted to strongly everted
rims (Figure 9f-k). Measurements of orifice diameter on the larger rim sherds range from 22 cm to
greater than 32 cm. The wheel-made earthenwares
have thick body walls (ranging from 6-9 mm) and
bases (11-14 mm in thickness), while rim thickness
varies by vessel form and profile, but range from
4-10 mm; in a few cases, the vessel rim is deliberately thickened below the lip (see Figure 9h).
The majority of the sherds (75 percent) have a
lead glaze, usually on the interior and/or exterior
vessel surfaces, with a smaller number (about 11
percent) having a glaze only on the exterior. A
green glaze was preferred (Figure lOb, g), and was
usually applied in globs and splotches, and several
sherds have streaks and lines of glaze. Brown or
clear glazes were 3-4 times less common in the
wheel-made earthenwares (Figure 1Of, h).
Analysis of the paste in the sherd crosssections (cf. Teltser 1993) indicate that the majority
(more than 55 percent) of the wheel-made coarse
earthenwares were fired in an oxidizing
environment, probably a kiln, although the number
of sherds fired in a reducing (or low oxygen)
environment and/or not completely oxidized during
firing suggests that some of the wheel-made
earthenwares may also have been fired in an open
air environment. Proportionally, however, the

Perttula, Boyd, Iruegas, and Nelson -Archeological Investigations at Area I

335

amount of wheel-made earthenwares that were not
completely oxidized during firing was much lower
than among the hand-made coarse earthenwares
(see below).

Hand-made Coarse Earthenwares
(Mier Plain)
The hand-made coarse earthenware from Area
I at Cabasefio is a distinctive part of the Spanish
Colonial and Tejano material culture along the lower
Rio Grande. This kind of earthenware (dubbed Mier
Plain), frequently tempered with bone, shell, or
crushed rock, has been found in numerous historic
archeological sites at Falcon Reservoir, and at other
sites along the lower Rio Grande (Perttula et al.
1997), and comparable hand-made earthenwares
have been reported from San Jose de Corralitos
(Fleming and Perttula, this volume) and the 1830sl 840s Fort Lipantitlan on the Nueces River (Ing
1976; Warren 1988). The relatively thick unglazed
sandy paste ware reported from Tonkawa Bluff (see
Hindes et al., this volume) also appears to be similar to the hand-made coarse earthenwares on the
lower Rio Grande.
Although petrographic and neutron activation analyses of the sherd pastes have not been
completed, we suspect that the hand-made coarse
earthenwares were made locally by Hispanic and
Tejano potters for local domestic consumption.
The fact that the hand-made earthenwares are so
common in a late 18th century context at the
Cabasefio site suggests that there was a limited
supply of affordable and good quality ceramics
(i.e., such as the majolica, chocolateras, and bean
pots) available through long-distance traffic with
central Mexico, and that the early settlers along
the lower Rio Grande needed to also manufacture ceramics for themselves.
There are 183 rim, body, and base sherds of
hand-made coarse earthenwares in Area I. The
vessels are medium-sized to large jars, bowls (see
Figures 8a and lOa), and ollas, with rounded or flat
lips and direct to strongly everted rims (see Figure
9a-e ). Measurements of orifice diameter on the
larger rim sherds range from 16 cm to greater than
32 cm, and average 23.2 Â± 4.7 cm. The coarse
hand-made earthenwares have thick body walls
(ranging from 6-10 mm) and bases (12-18 mm in
thickness). Rim thickness varies by vessel form
and profile, ranging from 4-18 mm; in one case, the

vessel lip is deliberately beveled on the vessel
interior (see Figure 9a).
Even though these coarse earthenware vessels
are hand-made, many of the sherds (56 percent)
have a lead glaze, usually on the vessel interior (48
percent), with a smaller number (about 9 percent)
having a glaze on the exterior and interior vessel
surfaces. Both green and brown glazes were used
(see Figure lOd-e), in roughly equal proportions,
and the glaze also applied in globs and splotches,
while several sherds have streaks and lines of glaze.
A few of the sherds have exterior brushing, wiping,
and fingernail marks, along with smudged and soot
marks, indicating their use over a fire during cooking activities.
Analysis of the sherd cross-sections indicate
that the majority (more than 60 percent) of the
hand-made coarse earthenwares were fired in an
oxidizing environment, but particularly common
are sherds from vessels that had not been completely oxidized during firing, leaving black carbon
streaks in the paste; only about 15 percent of these
sherds were from well-oxidized vessels. The remainder were from vessels fired in a reducing environment, including a number that were then cooled
in a high oxygen environment, leaving a thin oxidized band at the surface of the vessel core. The
combination of firing conditions suggests that the
hand-made coarse earthenwares were fired in an
open air environment.

336

Texas Archeological Society

Comparing the firing environments of the
hand-made and wheel-made coarse earthenwares,
as well as the olive jars, by whether the sherds are
from vessels with (a) oxidized exteriors, (b) reduced exteriors, or with (c) surface oxidized exteriors indicates that there is a statistically significant
difference (chi-square=12.33, df=4, p=.015) in
how these vessels were fired and cooled. Sherds
from hand-made earthenware vessels had higher
than expected proportions of surface oxidized exteriors (i.e., fired in a reducing environment, but
cooled in a high oxygen environment), while
sherds from wheel-made earthenware vessels had
lower than expected proportions of this kind of
firing environment. Olive jar sherds had significantly higher proportions of reduced exteriors, and
much lower proportions than expected of sherds
with oxidized exteriors.
If we consider differences among the earthenware sherds in firing environments by more
specific categories-namely oxidized, reduced,
incompletely oxidized, or reduced but cooled in
a high oxygen environment-the hand-made and
wheel-made coarse earthenwares and olive jar
vessels are again from demonstrable and statistically different populations (chi-square=l5.9,
df=8, p=.05). Hand-made coarse earthenware
vessels are proportionally more likely than the
wheel-made earthenware or olive jars to have
been fired in a reducing environment but cooled
in a high oxygen environment, while wheelmade earthenware is much more likely to have
been fired under oxidizing conditions than were
the hand-made coarse earthenwares. Incompletely oxidized and reduced vessels occur in
comparable frequencies in both the hand-made
and wheel-made earthenwares.
Olive Jars
Olive Jars are one of the mainstays of the
ceramic assemblage in Spanish Colonial sites in
Texas, where they were utilized for the storage of
liquids and the transportation of goods. The seven
Olive Jar body sherds from Cabase:fio, Area I (see
Figure l Oc ), appear to be late style jars, dating from
1780-1800 (Deagan 1987:34-35), as they have
compact fine pastes, lack the exterior white slip
seen more frequently in earlier jars, and have thick
vessel walls (mean thickness of 10.3 Â± 1.8 mm).
They were also fired under both oxidizing and

reducing environments, but most of the sherds are
from vessels that were incompletely oxidized.

Faunal Remains
A small amount of vertebrate faunal remains
(n=66) have been recovered in shovel testing in
Area I (Schniebs 1998), and faunal remains are
abundant along the shoreline in this area of the
Cabase:fio Ranch. The fauna includes large mammals (probably cow, but not identifiable to species), cottontail rabbit, deer-sized artiodactyl, cow,
and sheep or goat (Schniebs 1998:Table 7). More
than 90 percent of the fauna has been burned or
charred, indicating its trash midden context.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The Spanish Colonial and Tejano cultural heritage of the lower Rio Grande valley is embedded in
the many ranching communities established along
the north bank of the Rio Grande by Jose de
Escandon in the mid-18th century: "The ranch communities along the Lower Rio Grande developed a
distinctive identity, noticeably different from the
people of interior Mexico" (Tijerina 1998:xx).
Despite the many excellent historical studies
of the Spanish Colonial, Mexican, and early Texan
(post-1836) periods along the Texas-Mexican
border, and the recent concern with the lifeways of
Tejano ranchers (see Alonzo 1998; Tijerina 1998),
our understanding of these early Tejano ranching
communities and the lives they led can be enhanced
by intensive archeological studies of 18th-20th
century ranchos along the lower Rio Grande. There,
well-preserved Spanish Colonial and Tejano
archeological sites are known, such as Area I at the
Cabasefio Ranch, that warrant further and careful
investigations. These sites contain direct evidence
in the archeological record of house construction;
the spatial layout, use, evolution, and abandonment
of ranches and small communities by the ranching
patriarch, his extended family, and laborers; the
furnishings, material culture, and tools of the
ranching families, including goods obtained from
Mexican markets as well as other goods made
locally for local consumption; the building and use
of outdoor cooking ovens and lime kilns, corrals,
dipping vats, and other facilities; the raising,
consumption, and marketing of cattle, sheep, and

Perttula, Boyd, Iruegas, and Nelson -Archeological Investigations at Area I
goats; and the participation of local ranchers in
local and long-distance markets to obtain necessary
goods. We look forward to further archeological
research on the Spanish Colonial and Tejano cultural
heritage on the lower Rio Grande.

Site 41VT8 is located on the east bank of the Guadalupe River about 8 miles upstream from the presentday city of Victoria, Texas. It was the second location (1726-17 49) of the Spanish Presidio Nuestra Senora Santa
Marfa de Loreto de la Bahia del Espiritu Santo. The presidio site was discovered and recorded in 1966, and was
the focus of the 1968 Texas Archeological Society Field School.
This article, written in 1969, was originally intended to be part of the complete report of the limited
excavations conducted at the site. It deals strictly with one class of artifacts recovered there, the tin-enameled
Spanish majolica and French faience ceramics. I present descriptions of the sherds, the suite of represented types,
and comparisons with tin-enameled earthenwares documented previously at other Spanish Colonial sites
(primarily in Texas).

INTRODUCTION
The technique of coating ceramic surfaces with
an opaque white enamel, which was obtained by
adding an increment of tin to the glaze, is believed
to have evolved in the Middle East before the beginning of the Christian era. Gradually diffusing
along the eastern and southern Mediterranean regions, it was introduced to the native peoples of the
Iberian peninsula by Moorish invaders sometime
before A.D. 1000 (Goggin 1968:5). The practice
was accepted there, was modified and improved
upon, and eventually became a traditional feature
for the vessels and tiles of Spain and Portugal.
Potters from Spain carried the technology to Italy
and thence to France. By the 15th century, Holland
was producing a variation of the soft paste, lowfired pottery with its hard, opaque, vitreous coating; somewhat later, potteries in Germany, England,
and other smaller European countries were manufacturing it in quantity (Barber 1907:20, 31).
Today, three broad categories of the ware are
generally recognized: majolica (or maiolica),
faience, and delft. Each term is usually reflective of
its country of origin, although certain minor distinctions can be made between them. Thus, majolica connotes such tin-enameled pottery produced

in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Mexico, while faience
is ordinarily limited to that made in France and
Germany; delft is made in Holland and England.
Sherds identifiable as majolica and faience were
recovered from site 41 VT8, and in this article only
these two subdivisions of the ceramic tradition will
be discussed.

ANALYSIS METHODS
In referring to the vitreous coating of the softbodied wares, the term enamel is used rather than
glaze. Whereas the latter is clear, the former contains an additive that renders it opaque; in this
case it is a tin oxide (or tin ash) that is suspended
in a matrix of lead oxide and silica (Jelks
1958:202).
A graphic explanation is provided in Figure 1
of the nomenclature used for different areas and
salient features of the brimmed plates, or platos,
the most common vessel form found at 41 VT8.
Hardnesses were determined by scratch tests using
a set of standard mineral specimens (Mohave
Instrument Company, Long Beach, California), and
are expressed in Moh's scale. Colors are expressed

color classification guide was available when these
analyses were conducted in 1968-1969.

MAJOLICA
Majolica, in the form of utilitarian plates, cups,
and bowls, was probably aboard the first Spanish
ships to reach the New World. But it was only
following the establishment of outposts and settlements on various of the larger islands, and on the
American mainland, that the pottery, along with
any other European artifacts, might be expected to
have appeared in any significant amounts. Tunnell
and Ambler (1967:26) state that: "In Texas, tinenameled potsherds are of special interest because
they are found in large numbers on Spanish Colonial sites and are completely absent in the later
Anglo-American occupations." By the mid-1500s,
some majolica was being manufactured in New
Spain, particularly in the vicinity of Puebla, Mexico
(Barber 1911:4), and perhaps exclusively in that
locale at this early date. The industry grew quickly,
and consequently the need diminished for majolica
supplied from Spain.
As was the case with the earlier Spanish ware,
Mexican majolica underwent numerous temporal
changes in form and decorative mode. Only since
the 1960s, however, have useful archeological studies been made along these lines, starting with
Goggin's (1968) work.
There are 824 majolica sherds from 41VT8.
Their classification follows Goggin (1968), where
possible. Exceptions to this classification are noted,

but no new types are proposed in this paper. Sherds
grouped into Unclassified lots include those with
attributes so consistently similar as to likely constitute distinct types, but for which no precedents
have been noted in the archeological literature. The
several Miscellaneous lots contain sherds that may
belong to any two or more separate types or to no
recognizable type. Primary reliance was upon decorative features (including motifs and pigments) in
placing the majolica sherds in defined groups and
types; rim sherds were particularly important in
this respect.
Most of the majolica from 41VT8 is from two
vessel forms. By far the most common is a deep,
flat-rimmed (or brimmed) plate or plato. The other
is a deep cup or bowl, with nearly vertical sides and
usually without handles, termed an escudilla. A
few sherds were found that appear to represent a
drug jar, or albarello, a tall, cylindrical vessel with
somewhat constricted sides, while some may be
from small drinking cups or tauas. All forms are
wheel-thrown, with a low, circular foot-ring.
The inside edges of many of the vessel footrings appear to have been formed around the edge
of a disc, while the basal exterior shows evidence
of having rested on a smooth, flat surface during
vessel manufacture. This consists of rough depressions in the base that may be the result of small
patches of clay being pulled from it when the raw
ware was removed from the surface of the disc.
Thus, rather than the vessel base being hollowed
out as a separate step in shaping the piece, these
basal marks suggest that it and the foot ring were
molded over a pedestal (which was probably oiled
or dusted) centered on the potter's wheel during the
initial manufacture. The exterior of the ring, along
with the exterior of the rim, was shaped with a
template or jig, then the foot cut away from the
wheel with a thin wire (Goggin 1968:4).
The vessels were each kiln-fired twice, and
after the first firing they were coated with enamel
and then (in most cases) decorated. The second
firing (at a lower temperature than the first)
simultaneously fixed both the enamel and the
decorative element.
Crazing of the enamel is a feature common to
the 41 VT8 majolica. It ranges from light, hair-line
cracks to prominent and extensive cracking. Exfoliation, however, is quite rare. The enameled surfaces are scratched and scored on all sherds,
particularly on the interior plate surfaces. These

striae may not be from use, per se, but rather
from how the vessels were cleaned. Wet
sand, for example, was probably used to
scour the vessels. On some flat basal sherds
that lack other distinguishing characteristics,
this differential abrasion is useful in defining the interior and exterior surfaces.

Puebla, Mexico (Goggin 1968:168)
One trait shared by the San Luis Polychrome
sherds from 41 VT8 is the speckled surface of the
enamel; that is, the cream-colored surface appears
to be copiously peppered with tiny black dots. When
examined under a binocular microscope, the dots
are actually fenestrations resulting from ruptured
gas bubbles in the thin enamel, as well as dark
unbroken bubbles below the surface. The bubbles
often contain tiny, dark, angular inclusions (either
burnt-out impurities or deliberate additives to the
enamel) that are firmly embedded in the vitrified
walls of the voids. Although the speckled appearance of the enamel is not unique to San Lufs Polychrome, however, it is characteristic of a high
frequency of the type sherds.
Puebla Polychrome
Frequency: 14 sherds (Figure 2b)
Paste: Very fine and compact, but comparatively
soft. In some sherds the color is white and almost
chalk-like with a hardness of 2. Other sherds have
a buff color, are coarser or more granular, and
have an average hardness of 3. Both kinds contain
small amounts of fine, transparent to white sand
grains, and a small amount of finely crushed red
inclusions.
Form: Both plates and cups are represented in the
sherds. No rims were recovered, and the overall
dimensions of either form are undetermined. The
plate sherds average 5 mm in thickness at the base,
6 mm at the cavetto, and gradually taper to 4.5 mm
on the rim. The escudilla sherds range from 3-4
mm in thickness.
The two plate foot rings are 11 cm in diameter.
Both foot ring bases have been abraded, either as
the result of attrition during normal use, or more
likely they were deliberately abraded to even and
level the bottom of the foot ring.
Both the plates and cups were coated with white
enamel and then decorated with dark blue and black
paints. The opacity and purity of the enamel is
more notable on the Puebla Polychrome sherds than
on any other majolica type from the site. Crazing is
relatively light, particularly on the sherds with a

white paste, and surface bubbling is uncommon
except in the blue painted decoration. The hardness of the enamel is 6, while that of the blue paint
is 5.5.
Decoration: This type is probably one of the most
readily identifiable of the blue and white Puebla
wares because of its distinctive decorative style.
Two palettes were used over the white enamel, a
clear cobalt blue and an opaque black or very dark
brown. The blue is dark and brilliant where the
paint is thick, and a paler, grayish-blue where it is
thin. Where the blue paint overlaps the black framing lines, diffusing into them, a clear green color
is evident.
Although the decorations are basically the
same from vessel to vessel, there is some variation. The so-called dibujo de encaje pattern (Snow
1965:27) is present on all the specimens. This is a
complex, well-balanced design where the black is
applied in very fine, narrow lines to create a cobweb effect, one imitating lace (Goggin 1968: 174).
The blue paint appears as broad, symmetrically
arranged, and curvilinear ribbons bordered by the
detailed black elements.
Chronological Position: This majolica appears to
have been made no earlier than the last half of the
17th century and no longer manufactured by ca.
1725 (Goggin 1968:180; Snow 1965:32). Puebla
Polychrome is also present at the site of Fort Saint
Louis (41 VT4 ), where it is attributable to the 17221726 Spanish occupation of Presidio Nuestra Senora
de Loreto. The type seems to have its closest associations with San Lufs Polychrome, San Lufs Blue
on White, and Abo Polychrome (Goggin 1968: 179;
Snow 1965:33).
Comments: It is possible that two separate types
of majolica are included within the Puebla Polychrome from 41 VT8. One, the sherds with soft
light pastes, appear more like the "classic" Puebla
Polychrome in that the design elements are done
with black paint and with a uniform skill and care
in the repetitive detail work. The second group
includes the sherds with dark reddish-brown paint
instead of the black paint. On these sherds, the
lines forming the lacy fans or cobweb-like framework are broader and mottled, and more crudely
applied. Also, crazing of the enamel is more pronounced on these sherds, and the paste is darker,
coarser, and harder.

or inferior cavetto encircles the outer edge of the
foot ring on both vessel forms, but is most prominent on the plates.
The vessel surfaces are completely covered with
white enamel, but the coating was not uniform and
pinhole perforations are frequent; these are caused
by bubble pits and small impurities on the body
surface that repelled the slip or liquid enamel. The
slip covering the bisque is thinnest along the lip,
the foot, and the arris, and it has been reduced
further during the final firing of the piece through
the loss of free water and the absorption of the
enamel into the surface of the paste. During regular
use, the wear on the enamel was greatest at these
same points, and the enamel has been lost through
attrition and abrasion. On the ring foot, the enamel
has been removed by deliberate grinding to minimize projections from enamel drippings, or to permit the finished vessel to sit upright and stable.
A few cup sherds were poorly fired and slipped.
They have light throwing marks on the sherd interiors, and the enamel has a rough eggshell-textured
surface. The enamel is occasionally absent from
the thin lips of these cups.
Where the enamel is thin, it has a light cream
or soft pink tint; even where it is thicker and
opaque, the enamel has a grayish-white cast. The
enamel surface has a hardness of 6, a high gloss,
and a tactile smoothness. It contains myriad tiny
spherical gas bubbles apparent under magnification. Crazing is common, particularly on the basal
interiors of plates.
The use of firing stilts or spurs is evident from
the scars displayed on four basal plate sherds; three
scars on the exterior surface are rough and the interior surface scar has been lightly smoothed. Multiple firing of pieces, and the use of clay supports to
separate then, was usually restricted to the common
class of majolica in the Puebla potteries (Van de
Velde and Van de Velde 1927:468; Goggin 1968:7).
Decoration: It is confined exclusively to the interior of the plates and the exterior of cups, and the
designs are painted with blue glaze paint in a motif
of flowers, leaves, and complementary bands. The
blue paint is softer than the white enamel (5.5 hardness), and ranges in chroma from a brilliant dark
cobalt to a thin gray cerulean.
On the plates, two light blue bands always
encircle the rim. The outside one, placed about

5.0 mm from the unpainted lip, is usually the
broader (6.0 mm) of the two bands, with the second
band below it averaging about 3.0 mm in width.
Pendant from this narrower band, and spaced
equidistant along it, are eight (?) inflorescent
elements, each consisting of a group of slender,
rounded petals radiating from a center between the
two bordering bands. The flowers extend down the
rim to slightly below the arris, and are separated
from one another by undecorated arcs about as long
as they are wide. A central medallion fills the
round, flat field of the base, and includes several
daisy-like flowers and numerous paired and single
dark blue dots and ovals (probably leaves).
A different Puebla Blue on White decoration
includes two narrow light blue parallel lines that
form a 7 mm diameter circle centrally located on
the interior base. The circle encloses a single large
blue blossom and several random blue dots, and the
circular feature is framed by a close-set series of
large blue ovoids.
The lip on cups is also unpainted. Two closely
spaced light blue lines (about 3 mm wide) encircle
the rim exterior, about 3 mm below the lip, and
three other narrow blue horizontal lines gird the
cup at mid-height. Usually there is a single light
blue band painted around the lower part of the cup,
while the upper half of the cup has several large
dark blue flowers separated by clusters of dark blue
compound leaves. A fairly broad line of overlapping dark blue leaves (?) forms a sinuous band
around the lower half of the cups.
Regardless of how light-colored or thin the blue
paint is that forms the floral element, the horizontal
bands and circles are always lighter and thinner.
The differences are probably the result of different
methods of application: the bands painted while the
ceramic piece was being rotated (dispersing and
thinning the paint) and the primary design elements
(flowers and leaves) painted individually with a
loaded brush. The viscous glaze paint retained a
darker hue because of its greater thickness, often
standing in low-relief on the enameled surface.
A fragmentary potter's mark in dark opaque
brown paint is present on the exterior of two plate
base sherds. It may represent the initials of the
potter or the pottery, but it is incomplete (see Figure 5d).

majolica. Goggin (1968: 194) states that
it was made from ca. 1700-1850, with
similar derived forms being made at
the present time. The types of plates at
41 VT8 also occur in Texas at the 17461755 San Xavier missions in Milam
County (Gilmore 1969:91-92 and Figure 12f-g, i, p), at the 1762-1771 Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz in
Real County (Tunnell and Newcomb
1969:Figures 45a-c, f and 46b), and by
a few sherds from Mission Nuestra
Senora del Rosario in Goliad County
(1754-ca. 1821).
Among the Puebla Blue on White
cups, a large cup sherd from the San
Xavier missions closely resembles
those from 41 VT8 except that the floral design is pendant from the rim
bands (Gilmore 1969:Figure 8g). Another decorative variation from the
1731-1793 Mission San Juan
Capistrano-but on a bowl-has a
painted lip and blue bands painted on
the interior (Schuetz 1968: 13, 66,
l 969:Plate 26d-f).
Comments: The closely-related blue
on white majolica types need a careful and critical analysis to sort out
temporal differences in form and
decorative elements. Gerald (1968:4452) defined the San Elizario Polychrome type from the melange of
blue-on-white majolicas, and more such
work is warranted.

Paste: Similar to Puebla Blue on White
Form: Similar to Puebla Blue on White. Only the
deep rimmed plate is present in the 41 VT8 sample.
Decoration: San Agustin Blue on White is distinguished from Puebla Blue on White by its
decoration. The interior of the plates have
closely-spaced floral elements (in two distinct
shades of blue) painted into the white enamel
background (Figure 4a). A series of light blue

overlapping loops or arches are present on the
plate exterior along the underside of the rim and
ledge (Figure 4b ).
The plate interiors also have two light blue
bands encircling the rim, just below the lip, like
Puebla Blue on White. Below the bands are a series
of dark blue painted oval compound leaves and
daisy or carnation-like flowers. Light blue lines
depict viny stems, tendrils, and peticles, and connect with the dark blue elements. Random dots of

346

dark blue fill in otherwise undecorated areas of

The decoration appears from an examination
of large sherds to have been executed while the
white enamel was still wet; the custom was usually to allow the enamel to dry. The margins of the
design elements are blurred and feathered, diffusing into the white enamel. The San Agustfn Blue
on White vessels from 41 VT8 are distinguished
from later majolicas of similar character by their
unpainted lips and decorative elements that have
only dark blue and light blue painted colors.

Chronological Position: Goggin (1968:27, 189)
dates this type from about 1700 to 1730. In Texas,
decorative variations of San Agustin Blue on White
have been reported from the 1718-1793 Mission
Valero in Bexar County (Tunnell 1966:7, 13-14
and Figure 2f), the 1762-1771 Mission San Lorenzo
in Real County (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969:Figures 45g-h and 46a), and the 1766-1771 Presidio
Ahumada in Chambers County (Tunnell and Ambler
1967:30-31 and Figure 4f-g). At the latter site, however, the plate lip is covered by a blue painted
band. Similar majolica, with the light blue arches
decorating the rim exteriors, is known from sites in
Texas that postdate the mid-18th century (Anne A.
Fox, 1969 personal communication), but these also
have painted lips along with dark brown lines as
part of the interior decorative element.
Comments: One sherd has a single small (3.5 mm
in diameter) perforation through the rim, 1 cm below the lip (Figure 5g). A similar perforated sherd
was recovered at Mission San Lorenzo (Tunnell
and Newcomb 1969:Figure 47c). Di Peso
(1953:222) noted this feature on majolica sherds
from Quiburi, Arizona, and suggested that (instead
of being a crack lacing hole) a cord may have been
passed through the drilled perforation for suspending the vessel.
Huejotringo Blue on White
F:requency: 37 sherds (Figure 3c)
Fo:rm: Similar to Puebla Blue on White, except
proportionally more sherds have either a buff or
pink paste. Sherds with a white paste have a
body hardness of 2, while the buff and pink
paste sherds are harder (2.5).
Form: Plates similar to those of Puebla Blue on
White.

Decoration: The plate decoration consists of a
single blue band along the lip. On approximately
50 percent of the sherds, the lip is completely covered with paint, and on a few, it extends down the
underside of the rim a short distance. On the remainder, the paint extends only to the mid-line of
the lip. The paint uniformly overlaps the interior
rim surface about 5 mm.
The blue ranges from a pale grayish-blue to a
dark ultra-marine. The darker color appears to be
related to the thickness of the paint.
Ch:ronologkal Position: It appears to be contemporary with Puebla Blue on White, and Goggin
(1968:195) dates it to the 18th and 19th centuries.
Gerald (1968:43) places its manufacture from 1700
to the present time. In Texas, Huejotzingo Blue on
White is present at the first location ( 1722-1726) of
Presidio La Bahfa (Tunnell 1966:Figure 7), and at
all later Spanish Colonial sites in the state that have
large samples of majolica sherds.
Comments: Snow (1965:29) uses the term
"Huejotzingo Banded" for plates and bowls that are
decorated with a narrow band of "blue, green, or
yellow just below the rim." This description probably includes the wares from 41VT8, but his conclusion that it dates from 1780-1850 is obviously
anachronistic (Snow 1965:Table I).
Abo Polychrome

Frequency: 22 sherds (Figure Sa)
Paste: Similar to Puebla Blue on White
Form: Deep rimmed plates similar to Puebla Blue
on White. Small cups and bowls of Ab6 Polychrome
are known from other sites.
Deco:ration: The design is found only on the
interior of the plates, and consists of stylized floral
or arboreal elements bordered by alternating black
(or very dark brown), orange, and white bands.
These floral or arboreal elements are dominated
by ovoid leaves and varying sizes of circular and
pear-shaped fruits, and are executed in at least
five separate palette colors, with various shades of
each. The colors in descending order of use are:
opaque, ochreous orange; dull, citron yellow; a
light pea green to dark jade green; black or dark
brown; and dark indigo blue. The floral elements
are outlined by narrow black lines, and cursive
black lines (representing branches and stems)

Calhoun -Majolica and Faiencefrom the Presidio Loreto Site (41VT8)
connect the primary elements. Random dots of
thick dark blue paint are scattered casually over
the design and/or interior surface. They frequently
stand higher than the background enamel, but none
are outlined.
The heavily colored decorations are enclosed
by a single broad (5-8 mm) band of orange or
yellow that encircles the rim (one sherd has two
orange bands outlined in black); the band is 3 mm
from the lip. The band is itself bordered by a narrow black line along its outer edge, and two closelyspaced parallel lines along its inner margin. The
black lines along the rim border, as well as those
outlining the floral elements, are usually sharply
defined and opaque, but may be thinned, blurred,
and mottled, as the manganese flowed into the
lighter colors, indicating that the "black" is actually
a very dark brown.
Chronological Position: Goggin ( 1968: 171-172)
dates the type to the last half of the 17th century,
ending around 1700. He notes its close relationship
with Puebla Polychrome, and that it is commonly
found in association with San Lufs Polychrome.
Snow (1965:26 and Table 1) calls this type "Ab6
Polychrome I," and includes it among the majolica
present on Southwestern sites until 1725.

Unclassified Blue on White I
Frequency: 6 sherds
Paste: Similar to Puebla Blue on White.
Form: Cups (n=4 sherds) and bowls (n=2). Rim
diameters on the cups average 8.0 cm, and bowl
diameters average 11.0 cm. The rims are slightly
thickened and the lips are rounded.
Decoration: Limited to the vessel exteriors, with
two exceptions: first, the lip on the sherds is painted,
and the paint extends a short distance down the
interior rim; and second, one bowl rim sherd has
two narrow light blue lines around the vessel interior, adjacent to the lip band. The decoration below
the lip band is uncertain, but resembles a bowl
found at the 1746-1755 San Xavier missions
(Gilmore 1969:Figure 8k).
Unclassified Blue on White U
Frequency: 4 sherds
Paste: Similar to Puebla Blue on White.

347

Form: Vessels with nearly vertical and relatively
thick (4.5 mm) walls, such as cups or drug jars.
Decoration: Exterior floral motifs that are executed
in a camaieu style, resembling the interior designs
on San Agustfn Blue on White plates. The cups
and/or drug jars appear to have been decorated while
the enamel was still wet, also like San Agustfn Blue
on White.
Comments: These sherds may be from San
Agustfn Blue on White majolica, but are kept separate because only wide-rimmed plates are included
in that type.
Unclassified Blue on White IU
Frequency: l sherd
Paste: Similar to Puebla Blue on White.
Form: A small cup with broad and vertical corrugations (see also Gilmore 1969:90 and Figure 8d).
It has a wall thickness of 3.0 mm, and a projected
oral diameter of 8.0 cm.
Decoration: The sherd has only a blue painted lip,
with the paint extending 5.0 mm down the interior
rim and 2.0 mm on the exterior rim. The 1746-1755
San Xavier specimen also has no decoration other
than along the lip. A large section from a cup of the
same type has been reported from the first site of
Presidio La Bahfa on Garcitas Creek (V. C. Branch,
1969 personal communication).
Chronological Position: The occurrence of the simply decorated and fluted/corrugated cups at the three
sites noted above indicates a use range between ca.
1722-1755.
Comments: Gilmore ( 1969:91) associates this type
of majolica with Huejotzingo Blue on White, based
primarily on the occurrence of both types at the San
Xavier missions.

Unclassified Polychrome
Frequency: 7 sherds (Figure 5b-c)
Paste: Similar to Puebla Blue on White.
Form: Plates similar to Puebla Blue on White.
Decoration: The decoration is limited to the interior surface, and embodies distinctive styles of two
other majolica types. The rim design consists of a

348

Texas Archeological Society

broad yellow to yellowish-orange band bordered
with narrow black lines (one above it and two below) that is identical to Ab6 Polychrome. Pendant
from the band are dark blue floral elements exactly
like those on plates of Puebla Blue on White. The
decoration below the rim is less certain because of
the small number of sherds. It contains yellow,
orange, green, and blue elements in a floral or arboreal pattern, closely related to Ab6 Polychrome.
Fine black or dark brown lines frame each of the
colors, except for the blue. Narrow black lines also
depict branched (or thorny?) stems and tassels.
Where this unclassified polychrome majolica
can be readily distinguished from Ab6 Polychrome
is in the decoration of the base. Blue paint is present
not as capricious dots and spots, but as curving,
lanceolate slashes (see Figure 5c). Also, along the
rim, blue is used for the flowers. However, the
blue is the only color not framed by black lines,
which is characteristic of Ab6 Polychrome (this
attribute is useful in differentiating sherds of
Aranarna Polychrome, in which the green designs
were never outlined with black).
Comments: The unclassified polychrome majolica
represents an intermediate form of both Abo Polychrome and Puebla Blue on White, more akin to
the latter than the former. It was probably produced ca. 1725 or later. One rim sherd of this
particular polychrome majolica was found at the
1746-1755 San Xavier missions (Gilmore 1969:9293 and Figure 12n).
Miscellaneous Blue on White
Frequency: 347 sherds (Figure 5e-f)
Paste: Similar to Puebla Blue on White.
Form: The majority of the sherds (n=220) are
from rimmed plates, and the rest are from cups or
small bowls. One basal sherd from a plate has a
small triangular firing scar on its interior surface
and another scar on the exterior, both of which
were smoothed by intentional abrasion or vessel
use. A second base from another plate is
exceptionally thin (3.5 mm at the base, and 3.0
mm at the cavetto ), although otherwise it has the
same general dimensions as the other plates. One
escudillo or albarello base sherd has a foot ring.
There is little enamel visible along the bottom of
the foot ring, which is chipped and rough,
suggesting that the vessel had no secondary

support from the kiln floor or saggar during the
final firing.
One sherd from a cup or small jar (3.0 mm
thick) bears a noded finial, and the attachment scar
from one end of a loop (?) handle. The vertical
handle is round in cross-section and 6.0 mm in
diameter, and is the only appendage represented
among the tin-enameled sherds from the site.
Decoration: All sherds have simple, fragmentary
blue on white designs. The plate rim sherds have
portions of an interior band below the lip, and all
sufficiently large rim sherds have two such bands.
The cup sherds have partial designs comparable to the Unclassified Blue on White styles. Three
base sherds from small bowls have two closely
spaced light blue bands on the exterior, next to the
outside angle formed by the juncture of the ring
foot with the body. Another base sherd bears part
of a blue flower or leaves. Fourteen very small rim
sherds from cups and/or small bowls have only
painted lips.
Comments: There are two modified sherds in this
group. One, from along the arris of a plate, has two
perforations (10 mm apart and each 2 mm in diameter) that may represent an attempt to mend a cracked
vessel by lacing the fracture (see Figure 5f). The
other sherd may be about 25 percent of a disc, with a
smoothly ground and rounded margin, possibly 3 cm
in diameter. The sherd is 6.5 mm thick, and from a
plate base. Pottery discs made of majolica and other
glazed as well as unglazed sherds have been found at
several Spanish Colonial sites in Texas, including
Mission Nuestra Senora del Rosario, Presidio San
Luis de las Amarillas (Gilmore 1967:21 and Figure
6k), and Mission San Lorenzo (Tunnell and
Newcomb 1969: 103 and Figure 40a-b). Schuetz
(1969:94, 99) equates the ceramic discs with stone
ones found at Mission San Juan Capistrano and Mission San Antonio de Valero. Schuetz (1969:74) suggests that they are examples of gaming pieces called
quatros, used in a game of skill (of the same name)
that involved tossing them at a certain mark or small
hole, and that the pastime was probably accompanied by betting.
Miscellaneous Polychrome
Frequency: 29 sherds
Paste: Generally comparable to Puebla Blue on
White.

Calhoun-Majolica and Faiencefrom the Presidio Loreto Site (41VT8)

349

Form: Deep rimmed plates and one thick-walled
cup or bowl.

without painted rim bands. The remaining sherds
could have come from vessels with decorations.

Decoration: The plate sherds are decorated only
on the interior surface, while the escudilla or
albarello sherds are decorated only on the exterior. The six plate rim sherds have a broad band
of ochreous yellow bordered by dark brown
lines, and may belong to Ab6 Polychrome or
the Unclassified Polychrome group. Nine other
plate sherds are much like these, except that the
lip is missing.
Five very small sherds have only yellow paint
on one surface. They are included here because this
earth color appears only on polychrome wares on
the larger sherds from 41VT8.
A dark ochreous yellow paint covers the exterior surface of one hollowware body sherd, and a
narrow dark brown line extends across it under the
thin yellow paint. The other two cup or bowl sherds
are also painted yellow, but the color is bordered by
narrow brown lines.
One atypical plate rim has two dark brown
parallel lines that circumscribe the superior rim
surface just below the lip, rather than a single
bordering line at the outer edge of the rim band.
The sherd is included here on the same basis as
the yellow painted sherds discussed above.
The last sherd in this group is a base with a
fragmentary and unidentified subject carefully executed with fine black lines; a small spot of blue
paint is near one edge. The design may be part of
a furred animal, a conventionalized bird, or a human head. Such zoomorphic and anthropomorphic
elements have been noted on Ab6 Polychrome.

Comments: Plain white sherds comprise a large
percentage of the majolica sample from most 18th
century Spanish Colonial sites. However, plain
white vessels do not.

Miscellaneous Undecorated
Majolica
Frequency: 166 sherds
Paste: Similar to Puebla Blue on White.
Form: Plates (n=161 sherds) and cups (n=5 sherds).
The cup sherds include three foot rings (about 4 cm
in diameter) that lack enamel on their bottom edges.
One cup sherd, thicker (4.5 mm) than the others,
has a relatively hard (3) cream paste and a hard (7)
grayish-white enamel.
Decoration: None. Four rim sherds are large enough
to be reasonably sure that they are from vessels

FAIBNCE
Faience is the term generally used for the tinenameled ceramics produced in France. The
technology for its manufacture reached France by
ca. 1500 in the form of Italian majolica, and the
early examples produced there were imitative of
the Italian style. By 1550, native French expressions had a strong outlet in the ware, and between
1709 and ca, 1780, faience reached its highest
development in France (Lane 1946:16). It was used
for tiles, statuary, and ornamental and utilitarian
vessels.
The decorative style to about the mid-18th
century was inglaze. By 1750, however, most
French potteries were producing faience that was
an imitation of, and a cheap substitute for, Oriental
porcelain. This innovation was characterized,
among other traits, by overglaze painting of the
decorations. By 1800, the faience industry had
sharply declined in the face of competition from
the hard-paste, clear glaze ceramics that continue
to be made today.
The bulk of the faience produced by French
potteries in the 17th and 18th centuries, and
certainly the vast proportion of the faience that
eventually reached the New World, was the lowfired, inexpensive, simply decorated domestic and
utilitarian tablewares. Termed faience blanche,
"these plain or simply ornamented articles for
mass-consumption furnished the economic basis
on which some faience makers, by spreading their
costs, could afford to produce wares more
elaborately decorated" (Lane 1946:9). Throughout
its history, the faience industry in France depended
on the customs of the poorer bourgeoisie:
Both the large factories and the obscure
little country ones made great quantities
of faience with slight ornament in no
particular style, from the seventeenth till
well into the nineteenth century. So cheap
were these simple wares that almost any-

350

Texas Archeological Society
one could afford them and the style
spread. Montaigne, in his travel-journal
(1581), after visiting Siena, remarks how
well suited these white dishes were for
table use in comparison with the filthy
pewter found in French inns (Lane
1946:8-9).

In Texas, faience is less useful to the archeologist than majolica because French sites are comparatively few, and the faience reported to date has
been from sites that are attributable to Spanish occupations. The presence of faience at Spanish sites
in Texas is most often considered indicative of contact (whether direct or through intermediaries) between the Spanish and their French contemporaries
at outposts nearest them in colonial Louisiana.
Fehrenbach (1968:42) described the situation: "All
trade between Spanish colonies and foreigners was
strictly forbidden, of course, but on the frontier
such regulations were not only ridiculous, they could
not be enforced."
The Louisiana French were active traders.
Unburdened with the problems of colonization and
subjugation, they offered hardware, dry goods, and
alcohol in exchange for livestock and furs, for
information and alliances, and as bribes to
encourage new partners for their lucrative trading
ventures. Faience itself cannot have been an
important item in this commerce, and while no
sufficient reasons have been presented to conclude
that most of it reached Texas by way of Louisiana,
there is no doubt that the great majority of it did.
Therefore, it can serve as an index of inter-cultural
contact along a common frontier, and provides
clues about the amount of trade and the depth of
the trade's penetration into Spanish territory. The
more eastern the location of a Spanish military
garrison, mission, or civil settlement in Texas, the
more likely that French faience will be found there.
At Presidio Ahumada in Chambers County, for
example, 46 percent of the tin-enameled sherds
(n=559) were French faience (Tunnell and Ambler
1967:26-27), while less than 0.7 percent of the
617 tin-enameled sherds were faience at Mission
San Lorenzo in Real County (Tunnell and
Newcomb 1969:87-97). About 4 percent of the
tin-enameled sherds at 41 VT8 are faience.
Other than the decoration, the most readily
distinguishable characteristic of the faience from
41VT8 is the tendency of the enamel to flake away
from the body of the sherd. This exfoliation rarely

occurs on the majolica, while on the faience it is
not unusual for the sherds to have completely lost
the enamel from one or both surfaces. This appears
to be the result of the dissimilarity of the enamel
and the paste, in that the glaze on well-made and
well-fired ceramics (of which porcelain is probably
the premier example) must have the same
temperature coefficient of expansion as the paste
itself (Esbach 1963:74). Neither majolica or faience
meet this criterion, but majolica has a coarser and
more porous body than faience. The enamel
covering the surface of the majolica has penetrated
deeper into the paste and thereby has a mechanical
advantage over faience, the enamel of which has
only a surface fusion.
Temperature changes cause differential expansion between the paste and the enamel in both wares,
and set up stresses. Crazing of the enamel is the
primary form of stress relief in majolica. In faience,
however, with its inferior bond between enamel
and paste, crazing of the enamel is secondary to
exfoliation. This deficiency in faience was noted
nearly 300 years ago on tile facades and decorative
vessels destroyed by frost action (Lane 1946:16).
Another difference between the two wares at
41VT8 is the tendency of faience, with a finer
paste, to fracture sharp and straight, while majolica
breaks with rough and uneven edges. The paste of
faience has fewer black and red inclusions, and
they are smaller than the "tempering" particles in
the majolica. Also, the sand is more widely
dispersed in the faience paste, the grains are larger
in size, and are commonly a pink color. The tin
oxide content of the faience is higher than the
majolica, and it has a dull matte finish. The surface,
although very smooth, looks dry and feels chalky.
Majolica, on the other hand, has a glossy enamel
that feels waxen.
Rouen Faience
Frequency: 4 sherds (Figure 6a-b)
The paste of these body sherds is light buff,
with a hardness of 2. The sherds (from two different vessels) average 4.5 mm in thickness and come
from large bowls. The enamel on both surfaces is
a flat white, quite thick, and has a hardness of
about 6.5.
The decoration is confined to the vessel exterior
and is executed in dark blue paint with narrow
blue-black accent lines. Although the complete

design is not identifiable, elements present include
the repetitive use of elongated petal-like elements
with black edges, blue tips, and a blue line down
the center of each (Figure 6a). This decorative mode,
associated with the style rayonnant, is diagnostic of
the faience produced at Rouen, on the Normandy
coast, after 1647 (Lane 1946:20). Lane (1946:Plates
18-22) illustrates several vessel forms with this
particular design element, all of which he attributes
to the early 18th century. Barber (1907:26) states
that the ornamentation, which he calls broderie,
was suggested by the embroidered hangings or
drapery of the period, and illustrates a blue
"monochrome" plate and a large polychrome platter,
both typical of the "School of Rouen, France"
(Barber 1907:Figures 36 and 39).
The remaining small sherd has a fragmentary
design that may be part of the numeral "7," the
numeral "2," or part of the Roman capital letter
"Z." It is in dark blue with two narrow black supplementary lines (Figure 6b).

common on exterior surfaces, and both
sherd surfaces are covered with a thick
white enamel; crazing is light, but
exfoliation is extensive. The enamel has
a hardness of 6.5, is matte and completely
opaque, and has a very light blue-gray
tint (especially on the interior).
The decoration is inglaze and
found only on the exterior surfaces. It is
a conventionalized floral design executed
in dark green (leaves), dark blue (petals), and dark red (stems). A similar dark
ochreous red paint is mentioned by Lane
(1946:24) as typical of the Rouen potteries, along with a few smaller contemporary potteries that imitated this style prior
to 1737.
Unclassified Polychrome II Faien.ce

Frequency: 7 sherds (Figure 6e-f)
These faience sherds have a cream-colored
paste with a 2.5 hardness, and an average thickness
of 3.5 mm. The enamel on both surfaces is hard
(6.5), thin, and dirty-white in color.
Six sherds, including one rim and a basal sherd
with part of a low, narrow foot ring, may belong
to one vessel: a small, shallow plate decorated on
the interior surface (see Figure 6e-f). The other
sherd is decorated only on the exterior surface,
and appears to be from a small cup with nearly
vertical walls.
The decoration on both vessels includes a profusion of small flowers painted in pink, yellow, and
dark red, and leaves painted in light green. Other
indeterminate elements are rendered in thick dark
red paint. Narrow lines and isolated dark blue leaves
or petals form a set of grids beneath the floral
elements. Patterns of cross-hatching combined with
polychrome floral accents were common at potteries near Rouen ca. 1720-1740 (see Lane 1946:21
and Plate 25a).

Un.classified Polychrome I Faien.ce
Frequency: 6 sherds (Figure 6c-d)
The Polychrome I faience body sherds are thick
(5.5 mm) and have a fine, soft (a hardness of 2),
and light yellow paste. They were found in three
widely separated parts of the site, and may represent
sherds from six individual vessels, all fairly large
examples of hollow ware. Throwing marks are

Unclassified Blue on White I Faience
Frequency: 5 sherds (Figure 6g-h)
The sherds are probably faience blanche, or
bianchi de Faenza, intended for common use and
produced in great quantity in France between the
16th and 18th centuries (Lane 1946:8-9). They have

352

Texas Archeological Society

a fine cream-colored paste with a hardness of 2, a
grayish-white enamel with a hardness of 6, and a
fragmentary blue decoration painted on one surface. The two largest sherds are from plates with
rounded and thickened lips. The decoration on these
sherds consists of a 6.0 mm wide interior decorative band with two dark blue parallel lines that
enclose a series of blue dots and narrow diagonal
lines; the band is 5.0 mm below the lip (see Figure
6g). The design is similar to several of the simply
decorated plate sherds of French faience from
Presidio Ahumada (Tunnell and Ambler 1967:3542 and Figure 7). Another sherd, also from a plate,
has a fragmentary dark blue flower with six petals
painted on the interior surface. Of the last two
sherds, one has two dark blue parallel lines curving
across its exterior surface, and the other (a very
small sherd) has two narrow light blue parallel lines
on one surface.
Unclassified Blue on White II Faience
Frequency: 1 sherd (Figure 6i)
This sherd is a rim from a large, thin (4.0 mm)
plate. It has a light yellow paste with a fine texture
and a hardness of 2. The vessel diameter is ca. 32
cm, and the lip is rounded and slightly thickened.
Both surfaces of the sherd are covered with a relatively hard (6.5) white enamel with a bluish tint.
The enamel has no crazing or exfoliation.
A single band of blue paint, 5.0 mm wide,
borders the interior rim, about 6.0 mm below the
lip. The surface of the paint is thinly clouded by an
iridescence not unlike the patina that commonly
forms on bottle glass sherds.
This blue on white faience probably belongs to
a type within the faience blanche series of wares
(Lane 1946:8-9). Similar faience is reported by
Tunnell and Ambler (1967:37 and Figure 7e) from
Presidio Ahumada in Southeast Texas. They note
other examples in the 18th century French faience
from the Fortress of Louisburg in Nova Scotia
(Tunnell and Ambler 1967:33, 37-38).

2.5. Both surfaces of the sherds are coated with a
white enamel that has exfoliated to such an extent
that only traces of it can be observed under magnification. The enamel is milk white to grayish-white
in color, and one sherd has a pinkish tint; it is much
harder (6.0).
The undecorated faience sherds range from
2.5-8.5 mm in thickness. One large plate sherd has
a slightly concave exterior that is 6.5 cm in diameter and 5.5 mm in thickness (see Figure lb). One
large fluted sherd may be a "pouring lip" from a
large pitcher.

SUMMARY
The best available dates on the majolica and
faience from 41 VT8 (Figure 7), and the overlap in
date ranges, all strongly support the premise that
the site was the intermediate location of Presidio
Loreto de la Bahfa (Figure 8). The presidia was
relocated from its first site (41VT4) on Garcitas
Creek at the head of Lavaca Bay to the Guadalupe
River in 1726. It remained on the Guadalupe until
1749, when it was moved a final time to a location
on the San Antonio River (41GD7) near presentday Goliad (Oberste 1949:3-5). Since 41 VT8 is a
single component Spanish Colonial occupation,
these ceramics help expand the inventory of
majolica types, and perhaps some of the faience,

Lead-Glazed Ceramics from Four Texas Missions
Shawn B. Carlson and Ariel Malicse

ABSTRACT

Petrographic analyses were conducted on lead-glazed earthenwares from four 18th century Texas mission
sites. The primary goal was to identify manufacturing locales and, especially, to distinguish between Texasmade wares and Mexican-made wares. The results showed, partly through comparisons with wares of known
origin, that the Texas missions were reliant upon locally-made Indian wares and Mexican-made wares.

INTRODUCTION
Most lead-glazed earthenwares found on
colonial sites throughout the Spanish borderlands
are poorly known despite the fact that they occur
in great abundance (Deagan 1987:47-53). One
explanation for this is the difficulty in disseminating information about ceramics that have
relatively few distinguishing characteristics.
Comparison of these wares from site to site is
nearly impossible if the ceramics are not physically
examined. Even then, difficulties arise. To
overcome these problems in identification,
different techniques are available that provide
quantitative data that are easily compared. One of
these techniques is petrographic analysis.
A grant from the Texas Archeological Society
Donors Fund was used to conduct a petrographic
analysis of ceramics from four 18th century Texas
mission sites. The four sites were Missions Dolores
de los Ais (41SA25), San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz
(41RE1), San Juan Capistrano (41BX5), and
Rosario (41 GD2). The purpose of the study was to
identify the matrix and temper of the paste used in
the manufacture of lead-glazed wares found at these
sites. The underlying assumption was that the ceramics should reflect the local geology of their place
of manufacture. If this assumption is true, then it
should be possible to distinguish which ceramics
were made on-site and which were not. Typically, a
sample of clay from each site is necessary to verify
that the ceramics were made on-site. However, in

this study that was not possible to do. Rather, the
goal was to identify relative manufacturing locales,
especially those of Texas-made wares versus Mexican-made wares.
METHODS
Instrumental Neutron
Activation Analysis
The selection of samples was based on a previous study of the lead-glazed wares from the same
ceramic collections (Carlson 1994: 140-149; Carlson
and James 1995). That study was an Instrumental
Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA). In the INAA
study, the ceramic samples were ground into a powder, thus combining the matrix and temper. In the
petrographic analysis, they were thin-sectioned and
mounted on a slide so that both the matrix and
temper could be observed.
In the initial INAA study, 100 sherds were
ground and then sent to the nuclear reactor at Texas
A&M University, where the samples were bombarded with neutrons. This caused the various elements in the clays to be transformed into unstable
radioactive isotopes that emit gamma rays. The
gamma rays were then measured to determine the
quantities of each element present in the sample.
This method provides a signature for the various
pastes used in the manufacture of the ceramics, and
the signatures can be compared with each other to
determine a place of manufacture. Without a sample

Lastly, at Mission Rosario,
another pattern is found. Here, Indian
wares comprise 73 percent of the
assemblage, Mexican lead-glazed
wares 14 percent, and Mexican
majolica 10 percent.
These figures are considerably
different for missions that overlap in
time and space. However, the consistently low number of European
and Chinese wares show that there
was a greater reliance by these mission inhabitants on locally-made and
Mexican-made products.

clustered separately although both were characterized by a fine-textured body containing volcanic
ash typical of the known Mexican-made wares.
Mission Dolores is underlain largely by finegrained lithic arkose to feldspathic litharenite. This
means that sediments found in this region would be

rich in feldspars, quartz, and rock fragments-especially volcanic and metamorphic rock fragments
(Loucks et al. 1984) (see Figure 4b). Among the
four mission sites, this is the only logical site to
expect volcanic rock fragments similar to those
found in Mexico. However, the plagioclase laths,

Carlson and Malicse - Lead-Glazed Ceramics from Four Texas Missions
volcanic rock fragments, and minerals found in three
specimens examined from the site have well-defined crystal shapes or have larger fragments than
the texture of the formations found in this area.
Therefore, these three specimens were probably
manufactured outside this region. One of these
wares was identified by another researcher as
Tlaxcalan Redware. White orthoclase fragments,
gold biotite, and dark reddish-brown hematite are
apparent in this redware specimen (see Figure 4c).
Mission San Juan Capistrano is underlain by
Tertiary siliciclastics, Quaternary fluviatile terraces,
and Cretaceous limestone-rich formations. Ceramics manufactured using local sediments at this site
will largely contain limestone, quartz, feldspars,
and chert. The Tertiary sediments (e.g., the Wilcox
Formation) are quartz and orthoclase-rich and finegrained at this location. Therefore, the presence of
large volcanic fragments, plagiodase laths, large
spherulites, and euhedral minerals in the ceramics
are clear indications that they were imported. Using these criteria, it would appear that only two of
the five specimens examined could possibly be
manufactured at San Juan Capistrano.
Green lead-glazed earthenware and yellow
lead-glazed earthenware-both with red sandy
pastes that clustered together in the INAA studywere examined from Mission San Juan Capistrano.
The local Indian ware did not match the local geology, suggesting that the clays were transported from
elsewhere. This may be attributed to the sharp
change in geological deposits along the Edwards
Plateau, suggesting that clays could have been transported a short distance and still have been manufactured locally. The remaining two samples were
Galera Polychrome-a known Mexican-made
ware-and a reddish-brown lead-glazed ware.
Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz is
largely underlain by Cretaceous limestone/dolomiterich formations. Ceramics manufactured using materials from this site should reflect high limestone
or dolomite fragments. The components of the ceramics found at Mission San Lorenzo were mainly
comprised of quartz, feldspars, plutonic and rock
fragments, biotite, and altered grains. A zoned plagioclase, a clear indication of volcanic origin, is
present in a green lead-glazed earthenware (see Figure 4d). These components indicate a non-carbonate source and, therefore, evidence that most of the
ceramics found at the site were imported. The seven
samples examined included red-slipped Mexican

359

wares, brown lead-glazed wares, olive lead-glazed
wares, a yellow lead-glazed ware, and an imported
Indian ware.
In summary, 16 of the 19 petrographic samples
from the four mission sites are believed to have
been imported (Table 1). The only locally made
wares included the Indian ware present at Mission
Rosario and the yellow and green lead-glazed wares
at Mission San Juan Capistrano. In addition to the
basic assumption that the ceramics would reflect
the local geology, it was also assumed that the two
basic pastes observed-the sandy paste and the finetextured paste with volcanic ash-reflected Texas
versus Mexican wares. This appears to hold true
except at Mission San Lorenzo, where none of the
wares, including the sandy paste wares, reflect the
local geology.
In addition to the generalizations just stated,
detritals suspected to have come from Mexico or
other regions with complex geology were present
in the samples and showed the following characteristics. Specimen 2 (red-slipped Mexican ware) had
plagioclase laths in the matrix that appeared as narrow needle-like objects (see Figure 4e). Also, this
specimen had volcanic rock fragments. In Specimen 11 (olive lead-glazed earthenware), plutonic
rock fragments and zoned plagioclase appeared in
the paste (see Figure 4d, f). In Specimen 7
("Tlaxcalan redware"), there is an apparent association of yellow biotite with samples from volcanic terrain (see Figure 4c). Lastly, spherulites were
present in Specimen 5 (Galera Polychrome).
These conclusions are true only if the original
assumptions are correct. If, however, the materials
used in the ceramics were taken from somewhere
else in Texas (e.g., near the Llano uplift or in West
Texas where the geology is also complex), then
there is no way of identifying where the ceramics
came from. Only sampling of the local materials
would verify the manufacturing locales.

RESULTS
The most significant result of the data analysis
was the consistently high frequency of Mexican
wares present at each site. The extreme difficulty in
acquiring imported European and Chinese wares
along with the declining economy of Spain may
explain the presence or absence of various ceramics
at the missions. The Chinese porcelains, occurring

central Mexico to Saltillo and San Antonio. The
condition of the roads prohibited transport by wagon
so pack mules were used instead. The road from
Acapulco to Mexico City, known as the "China" or
"Asiatic" road and the road from Vera Cruz to
Mexico City, known as the "European" road, were
described in detail by Alexander Von Humboldt,

Carlson and Malicse - Lead-Glazed Ceramics from Four Texas Missions
who visited New Spain in 1803. The road from
Vera Cruz he described as "nothing but a narrow
and crooked path, and the most difficult, perhaps in
all America" (Humboldt 1966, Vol. 4:3). In contrast,
the road from Acapulco ascended gradually toward
Mexico City, was wide, and in generally good
condition. Even as late as 1803, Humboldt described
the roads as impassable by wagons. A more typical
description of roads during the 18th century is that
of the road from Natchitoches to Los Adaes. A
1767 document calls it "a little-marked path over
uneven terrain, obscured by the woods" (Steele
1985:3).
The European wares, such as stonewares and
refined earthenwares that were present at the missions in quantities of 1-3 percent, would have arrived in New Spain through the Vera Cruz port.
The fact that intercolonial trade during the 18th
century had been strictly limited to prevent competition with Spain's home industries may partially
explain their absence (Schurz 1939:398-410;
Deagan 1987:19-24). New World exports were limited to the port of Cadiz, and Spanish foodstuffs
and manufactured imports were received only
through the port of Vera Cruz. So, during the 18th
century any European imports-not made in
Spain-were already highly desirable and prohibitive in cost before the overland journey through
central Mexico and Texas even began. By the turn
of the 19th century, however, these wares were
much more available. Humboldt claims that in 1803
there were nearly 150 ships arriving yearly from
Spain at the port of Vera Cruz whereas 50 years
earlier there was only one a year (Humboldt 1966,
Vol. 4:33-50). European wares were so popular by
1803 that their quantities were three times that of
Mexican pottery despite a 70 percent greater cost.
Of the 46 pottery manufacturers existing in Mexico
in 1793, only 16 were remaining by 1803 (Humboldt
1966, Vol. 3:469).
The large quantity of locally-made Indian
wares and Mexican-made wares at the Texas missions suggests that there was a greater reliance upon
these wares than on European or Chinese wares
during the 18th century. Furthermore, the complete
absence of Spanish-made wares, with the exception
of olive jars, suggests that support from Spain was
minimal. Access to any manufactured wares was
difficult, if not impossible. The condition of roads
throughout New Spain during the 18th century, the
distance between settlements, and the continued

361

threats by hostile Indians all contributed to higher
costs, making it nearly as difficult to obtain products of New Spain as those of Europe or the Orient.
Consequently, locally-made Indian wares or inexpensive Mexican wares were both the easiest and
the least expensive to obtain. By distinguishing between Texas-made wares and Mexican-made wares
in this study, it was possible to show the degree to
which the isolated missions relied upon imported
wares from Mexico rather than those from Europe
or the Orient.

The Lithic Artifacts of the Native Americans
at the Spanish Colonial Missions
at Guerrero, Coahuila, Mexico
Betty J. Inman

ABSTRACT
This article presents the results of a lithic analysis to examine the retention of traditional lifeways and
aspects of acculturation at two mission sites in Mexico. Beginning in January 1700, three missions (San Juan
Bautista, San Bernardo, and San Francisco de Solano) were established near the Rio Grande, opening the
gateway to Spanish Texas. In 1717, the missionary line was extended northward to the San Antonio River and
San Francisco de Solano was re-located there, becoming Mission Valero and beginning the mission system
in southern Texas.
Stone tool manufacture and use continued in the mission setting, suggesting that traditional lifeways were
not wholly abandoned. Further evidence of traditional lifeways is provided by the abundance and variety of
wild game fauna! materials, bone marrow extraction seen in some faunal materials, and continued plant food
processing. The adoption and use of one arrow point style, the Guerrero, at San Juan Bautista and San
Bernardo, and its spread throughout the missions of southern Texas, attests to the movement of Native peoples
between missions and the widespread trade network documented in historical records. Use-wear analysis of
stone tools from the sites indicates the processing of animal products (hide/meat), wood, and plant materials.

INTRODUCTION
Beginning in January 1700, the Native peoples
entering the missions at Guerrero continued their
ancient tradition of stone tool manufacture. This
article presents an analysis of the lithic artifacts
from excavations at missions San Juan Bautista and
San Bernardo to examine the retention of traditional lifeways and cultural change through time as
it is expressed in the archeological record (see also
Inman 1997).
Under the direction of R. E. W. Adams, the
University of Texas at San Antonio, excavations
were conducted in 1975-1976 at the two missions
(Adams 1977). This research, named the "Gateway
Project," focused on archeological, ethnohistorical,
and historical aspects of the Rio Grande missions.
Contributors to the project included Thomas R.
Hester, T. N. Campbell, Felix D. Almaraz, Jr.,
Parker Nunley, Anne A. Fox, Fred Valdez Jr., and
Billy Davidson.

After completion of the excavations in 1976, it
was not possible to export the artifacts to the United
States. Therefore, a complete lithic analysis was
not conducted. In 1996, however, an agreement
between Mexican government officials and Dr.
Thomas R. Hester, Director of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), allowed for
the transport of artifacts for analysis. The research
was funded, in part, by a Tinker Field Research
Grant to the author from the Institute of Latin
American Studies at The University of Texas at
Austin (Inman 1997).

AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
In the late 17th century, the Spanish, arriving
in the area of the Rio Grande where today lies the

mobile groups of hunters and gatherers for at least
11,000 years (Hester 1995). This region of northeastern Mexico is watered by the Rio Grande, and
in the past, freshwater springs were located nearby,
creating an oasis in the generally arid north
Coahuilan desert. The springs carried a high charge
of travertine in solution and these deposits formed
a natural dam in the remote past, creating a large
lake and a smaller lake behind it. While the springs
are still present, the large lake no longer exists
due to the dynamiting of the darn in the early 20th
century. Several fords of the river were also nearby
and these, undoubtedly known about and used by
Native peoples in ancient times (Adams 1977),
were an important factor drawing the Spanish to
the area. Early research labeled the Native groups
of northeastern Mexico (and adjacent southern
Texas) as "Coahuiltecans" because it was believed
they all spoke a similar language. Later work has
defined the linguistic and cultural diversity of the
Native peoples. At least six different languages
were found among the "Coahuiltecans" who came
to the Rio Grande missions (Weddle 1968; Goddard
1979; Campbell 1988). Seven major linguistic
groups-Coahuilteco, Karankawa, Comecrudo,
Cotonarne, Solano, Tonkawa, and Aranama-were
identified by Campbell (1992) and Goddard (1979).

In more recent work, Johnson and Campbell (1992)
named "Sanan" as another of the aboriginal languages spoken in the region.

SPANISH COLONIZATION
Spanish expansion of the northern frontier toward the Rio Grande proceeded for a variety of
reasons: (a) interest in finding new sources of mineral wealth; (b) the desire to convert the Native
peoples to Christianity; and (c) French intrusion to
the east. It is likely that curiosity and adventure
also played a part (Weddle 1968).
Between 1700 and 1703, Franciscan friars of
the Apostolic College of Santa Cruz de Queretaro
founded three missions-San Juan Bautista (January 1700), San Francisco Solano (March 1700),
and San Bernardo (1702)-within close proximity
to each other on the west bank of the Rio Grande
(Figure 2). These three missions were situated in a
triangular pattern around the important springs and
lakes (Eaton 1981). Initially, a mobile cavalry unit
was assigned to protect the missions, and later a
permanent garrison, the Presidio San Juan Bautista,
was erected. In 1717, the friars proposed to extend
the missionary line northward to the San Antonio
River. Mission San Francisco de Solano was closed
and its personnel was re-assigned to a new mission
at San Antonio (later to be named Valero). The
remaining missions, San Juan Bautista and San
Bernardo, began to achieve material and spiritual
success by 1750 and were able to send supplies
north to the new missions in Texas (Almaraz 1979).
The two missions at Guerrero continued until they
were secularized in 1794 (Eaton 1981 ).

MISSION SAN JUAN BAUTISTA
Mission San Juan Bautista was established in
1699 on the Rio Sabinas. It was unsuccessful there
and was moved farther north and situated near the
Rio Grande on January 1, 1700. The location selected for its re-establishment was in the Valle de
Circumcision, about 7 km from the Rio Grande
where there were three important river crossings.
Here the soil of the drainage plain was very fertile
and could be irrigated with water from upland
springs (Almaraz 1979). More than 500 natives
were gathered at the mission settlement which

365

opened the "gateway to Spanish Texas" (cf. Weddle
1968). This second location is presumed to be in
the main plaza area of the present-day village of
Guerrero where the church now stands (Eaton 1981 ).
In 1740, Mission San Juan Bautista was moved for
a third time to a hillside west of the presidio and a
short distance from the Spanish settlement. At this
final location it developed into a large and impressive complex (Weddle 1968). The mission was secularized in 1794 and abandoned sometime after 1810
(Eaton 1981).
Archeological investigations were begun at
Mission San Juan Bautista during the summer of
1976 (Adams 1977). Testing at the mission's third
and final location revealed structural remains and
cultural materials (Figure 3). Due to destruction
and stone robbing, the only visible remains at the
site were low ridges and larger mounds. In 1976,
the most prominent area of the site was excavated
and architectural features of the church were found
in the work. A large amount of fallen masonry and
accumulated dirt was removed in order to locate
the floor and wall remains.
A human burial was discovered in the main
altar of the church, extending into the east part of
the main altar. There were no grave goods and it
was determined that the burial had been placed
there after the church was abandoned.
The monastery quadrangle was located adjacent to the south side of the church. Within the
enclosure, and near the south wall, was the circular
opening of a well or cistern that had been artificially cut through the limestone bedrock.
A few meters south of the monastery quadrangle, the remains of a large structure, probably
the granary, were uncovered. On the south side of
the probable granary, excavations identified the
remains of walls and packed dirt floors (possibly
the textile mill, blacksmith shop, carpenter shop,
and other workshops). The Native housing area
was located just south of the group of industrial
structures and extended farther to the west. The
total length of the rectangular structure that was
uncovered measured 108 m with a width of 5.4 m.
This long building was probably divided into
numerous small apartments. The archeological data
corresponds with Weddle's (1968) note that housing units for Native families sometimes contained
as many as 20 small apartments. Midden deposits,
from both sides of the eastern half of the structure,
produced abundant cultural materials, while a very

small amount was recovered from the structure's
western half. No architectural remains above the
wall footings were found in the western part of the
structure, and it appears that no walls had been
constructed in that area. It is likely that the eastern
section of the Native housing structure was occupied but that construction of the western portion
had not been completed when the building was
abandoned.
A wall footing, in circular plan and about 8 m
in diameter, was also uncovered. This unusual feature, suggestive of a defensive bastion, while not
routinely integral to mission structures, is also found
at missions San Jose and Espada in San Antonio.

Spatial and Temporal Context
of the Lithic Artifacts
The cultural materials from San Juan Bautista
represent an occupation from 1740 to 1794. The
bulk of the lithics (and other cultural materials) is
from midden contexts. Excavations-53 trenches
of various sizes (totaling 39 m2 )-were located

along the outside foundations, inside the structures,
and adjacent to the Native housing area (but within
the mission compound). From these excavations it
was apparent that cultural debris had accumulated
along the outer walls of the Native habitation quarters, particularly where windows and doors appear
to have been located. Based on field notes and
maps, the average depth of the midden concentration was 20-30 cm. The deepest exca-vations, generally along foundation walls, were to 60 cm. A
dense midden, specifically containing bone fragments (predominantly cow and horse), was on the
south side of the bastion.
In the eastern part of the mission compound, at
ground surface and to the west of the structural
remains thought to be the workshop, were remnants
of at least two hearth features. They were on the
remains of a packed dirt floor with gravel
underneath. Associated with these features was
charcoal, ash, large amounts of burned bone, mussel
shells, and sherds. At 40-60 cm bs, large stones
(thought to be part of a foundation) were located. A
test unit, placed several meters north of the Native

Inman - Lithic Artifacts of the Native Americans at the Spanish Colonial Missions
housing foundation, yielded scattered rubble but
few cultural materials.
A small mound, located 6 m southeast of the
east end of the Native housing foundation, was
also excavated. The upper 5 cm of the 2 x 2 m test
unit (Operation 101; Sub-operation GG-Level 1-5
and RH-Level 1-4) was a brown topsoil. Underneath, to a depth of 25 cm, was a dense midden
deposit. From 25 to 30 cm was a very hard packed
zone of soil and gravel with some cultural debris.
A packed gravel with small amounts of cultural
material was encountered from 30-42 cm bs. From
42-60 cm was a loose soil with some gravel and
small amounts of bone and charcoal. At 60 cm, a
very hard packed surface was reached, possibly
the floor of a Native jacal structure. In the southeast quadrant of the unit, the hard packed surface
was reached at a depth of 40 cm. Cultural materials recovered included bone fragments, sherds,
land snails (Rabdotus), and mussel shells. A dense
concentration of lithics (two unifaces; a sootstained distal tip of a large biface; a medial preform fragment; two Guerrero arrow points; one
core; one modified blade fragment; and three modified flakes) was recovered from this test unit.
It is difficult to interpret these cultural materials because in mixed midden contexts vertical and
horizontal associations are obscured. The living
floors that were excavated within the Native habitation structures yielded few cultural remains. It is

likely that the earthen floors were capped with
tiles that were collected for re-use after the building was abandoned. Smaller concentrations of artifacts and faunal materials were found in test units
in the mission compound, but they do not appear
to be associated with activity areas. Perhaps following aboriginal tradition, tasks such as stone
tool manufacture took place outside the living areas, and perhaps even outside the mission compound (Hester 1977). There were no clear patterns
in the spatial concentration of debitage from San
Juan Bautista, although larger concentrations were
found to the east of the Native housing area; next
to foundation stones (of the probable workshop);
adjacent to foundations of the Native housing
structures; and outside the north side of the bastion foundation.

LITHIC ARTIFACTS (CHIPPED
AND GROUND STONE)
Lithic artifacts from San Juan Bautista include
chipped stone arrow points, dart points, unifaces,
bifaces, cores, modified flakes, debitage, and
ground stone tools (Table 1). Typological and
chronological data follow Turner and Hester
(1993). Measurements are in millimeters (mm) and
weights in grams (g); a dash indicates a fragmentary specimen.

Arrow Points
The 10 arrow points (nine Guerrero and one
miscellaneous form) from Mission San Juan
Bautista are bifacially chipped, stemless, triangular
specimens (Table 2 and Figure 4). One is crudely
chipped and may be an arrow point preform
(Figure 4a), and another is made from green bottle
glass (Figure 4c); the remainder are made from
chert. One Guerrero is triangular in form with a
straight base and a broken distal tip (Figure 4b), a
second is ovate in form with a straight base (Figure
4d), while several others have concave bases
(Figure 4f-j).

Dart Points
The seven dart points recovered from San Juan
Bautista are fragmentary (see Inman 1997:Figure

a missing distal tip and broken barbs, a rectangular
basal fragment that may have been a knife, a dart
point basal fragment (of translucent brown chert)
similar to a Langtry, and a Pedernales-like form
with a broken distal tip; it is made from a purple
heat-treated chert. Another possible dart point is
highly patinated and mostly unifacial (Abasololike ), and there is also an un-notched basal
fragment and a crudely chipped dart point (with a
broken distal tip) of indeterminate type.

Ten biface fragments were recovered from the
excavations at San Juan Bautista. Three of the
specimens are distal fragments of large bifaces;
two are extremely finely chipped, one is made from
a translucent medium gray chert; a second specimen
is soot-stained (see Inman 1997:Figure 6f); the third
distal fragment is crude and unfinished. Of the
remaining biface fragments, one is a medial
fragment of a large biface (possible knife); three
are classified as preforms; and four are small
specimens with rudimentary bifacial chipping.

Figure 5. Core and Unifacial Tool.

Eight unifacial tools are small, ovate to elongate specimens that are thick and plano-convex.
They range from 21-31 cm in length; widths are

Inman - Lithic Artifacts of the Native Americans at the
variable, and the maJonty are fragments. These
small, informally-made tools can probably be classified as end scrapers or end and side scrapers (although two specimens may be gunflint fragments).
A larger specimen, a side and end scraper, has edge
damage on the bit end. Although this tool is more
similar in form to large scrapers commonly found
at Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites in South and
Central Texas, it is less formal and crudely flaked.
Another unifacial tool (Figure Sb) has a 60Â° edge
angle and resembles a Nueces scraper (Turner and
Hester 1993:267-268).
Cobble Tools
Two large cobble tools are "choppers," cobbles
with a few flakes removed from one end (Turner
and Hester 1993). They range from 80-113 mm in
length, 79-82 mm in width, and 42-4S mm in thickness, but weigh 288-608 g. One cobble tool (Figure 6a) is made of a coarse tan/gray chert with
cortex. Battering is evident on the bit end. The
other is a light gray chert cobble tool with cortex
remaining on approximately one-third of the specimen (Figure 6b). It is likely that both tools were

Colonial Missions

369

crudely fashioned expedient tools as no evidence
(micro-flaking, crushing, or polish) of extended
use on the bit end of either tool was detected using
low-power microscopy (10-40X).
Cores
Three cores and five split or halved cobbles
were recovered at San Juan Bautista. The majority
of split cobbles appeared to have been tested and
had a few flakes removed. One specimen has a
small amount of battering on one end and may have
been used as a hammerstone. Of the three cores,
two are expended polyhedral blade cores from
which a series of blades or flakes have been removed (see Figure Sa). The third core is a tan finegrained chert, with a flake removed at one end to
create a platform from which flakes (or blades)
were then struck. Metric data for the cores indicate
they ranged from 43-64 mm in length, 29-S3 mm in
width, and were 29-4S mm in thickness. They
weighed between 52.8-86.3 g.
Modified Flakes
and Blades
A total of 28 modified flakes (11 with two
chipped or trimmed edges and 17 with one modified edge) are in the assemblage. Additionally, one
blade (trimmed bifacially on both lateral edges)
was found at the mission.

Ground Stone

Figure 6. Cobble tools (choppers).

There are a total of 1S ground or polished stone
artifacts from San Juan Bautista. This includes a
large highly polished gray sandstone piece with
very fine striations on both dorsal and ventral surfaces (Figure 7a). It is likely that this tool was a
rubbing stone used for hide softening and processing. Obvious use-wear in the form of battering on
one end and damaged and broken areas on the opposite end of a large quartzite stone indicates its
probable use as a hammerstone (Figure 7b ). Two
dark brown hematite pebbles (Figure 8a-b) have
most surfaces polished, and may have been used as
burnishing stones for the final stages of pottery
production. Eight metate fragments, including a
basal fragment (Figure 9b) made from a porous,
vesicular dark gray basalt, four mano fragments,

and a two-handed mano fragment (Figure 9a) were
also recovered during the excavations.

flake removals and traces of remaining cortex on
the striking platform or on the outer flake face
(Turner and Hester 1993). Interior flakes are struck
from a core after all cortex has been removed
(Shafer 1969). Thinning flakes have been removed
from a flake, preform (biface), or uni face by percussion or pressure flaking (Crabtree 1972).
The number of flakes from San Juan Bautista
is 516; however, the analyzed sample transported
to TARL numbered only 328. From the analysis of
the debris, it appears that small pebbles were
frequently reduced with fairly unsophisticated
techniques. The debitage includes few cores; the
core fragments present are primarily pieces of split
cobbles. The majority of the debitage are cortex
flakes and pieces of split cobbles (Table 3); interior
flakes (and biface thinning flakes) are relatively
infrequent. Eight percent of the debitage was heat
damaged (i.e., crenation fractures [potlids] and
heat-treating with pink coloration, or an over-all
glassy sheen).
Summary of Lithic Artifacts
from San Jmm Bautista
The relatively small amount of lithic artifacts
found at San Juan Bautista (third location) may reflect the relatively short time span during which it
was occupied (1740-1794). Stone tools were being
made from local cherts (small to medium-sized river
cobbles) and one of the techniques being used was
the bi-polar method (Crabtree 1972). This technique works well with small cobbles and produces
distinctive wedge-shaped flakes
similar to segments of an orange.
A blade/core technology was
also being used.
Arrow points were made for
hunting and defense. Dart points
were present; however, it is
likely that they were scavenged
from nearby Archaic sites. The
remainder of the tools are
preforms, bifaces, unifaces,
modified flakes, and modified
b
cobbles. One blade and one
expended blade core was
recovered. The more formal,
large unifaces (scrapers) were
not part of the tool inventory;
flake tools, however, were

numerous. It is likely that these expedient tools
were supplemented by metal knives provided by
the Spanish. Few metal tools, however, were
recovered from the excavations and documents
indicate they were scarce. No perforators were found
and only two specimens can be considered possible
gunflints. The presence of ground stone indicates
plant food processing continued during the mission
occupation. Vesicular basalt metates and manos
were brought to San Juan Bautista as trade items
from Saltillo (Almaraz 1979). Locally available
sandstone was also used for manos. A large, dense
basalt stone was probably used for softening hides,
while a small hematite stone may have been used in
pottery manufacture.

MISSION SAN BERNARDO
San Bernardo, established in 1702 and located
approximately 5 km northeast of San Juan Bautista,
is the only mission of the three founded at Guerrero
with a standing structure. The original church was
in the eastern section of the site, and a second
church was erected in 1760 but was never completed
(Figure 10). The structure was stabilized in the
mid-1970s under the direction of the Instituto

371

Nacional de Antro-pologia e Historia de Mexico
(Eaton 1989).
At that time, an area around the church was
being developed as a park and picnic area, and to
the north of the church, a section of land had been
cleared using heavy equipment. Excavations in
1975-1976 in this section uncovered the original
surface of the mission quadrangle area 18 cm below the disturbed ground surface. Abundant cultural materials were recovered from this surface
and excavations also revealed the foundation stones
of the Native housing. This linear structure measured approximately 33 m in length and 5 m in
width (Eaton 1989).
As work continued, five additional building
foundations of approximately the same dimensions were uncovered (see Figure 10). Diagnostic
cultural materials and descriptive archival information confirmed that these structures housed the
Native peoples. It is likely that each structure was
divided into small apartments for family groups,
although no interior walls were evident. An inventory from 1772 indicates that 40 houses were already built at San Bernardo. Perhaps each stone
structure was divided into 7 family apartments. In
plan, the structures were aligned north-south and
formed the sides of a street that extended north
from the front entrance of the existing church
(Eaton 1981).

Native housing structures and plaza adjacent to the
structures. Forty-one Guerrero points are almost
completely intact; the remaining 24 specimens are
classifiable bases. Metric data on the points is provided in Inman (1997:Table 7), but the mean dimensions of the points are: 28.3 mm in length
(n=42), 15.6 mm in width (n=65), and 3.98 mm in
thickness (n=65); mean weights of the specimens
are 1.73 g (n=43). A variety of base shapes is present
in the Guerrero points: straight, slightly concave,
and those having a distinct basal concavity. Several
specimens show evidence of thermal alteration
(potlids and pink coloration). The Guerrero points

Dart Points
Of the 43 dart points from San Bernardo North,
three resemble Desmuke points and three are similar to Abasolo. Other forms resemble Martindale,
Tortugas, Shumla, Marshall, and Langtry (see
Inman l 997:Figures 18-20). Evidence of heat treating (Hester and Collins 1974) is present on one of
the Shumla-like specimens. Other untyped dart
points from the site include specimens that are sidenotched, corner-notched, and one that has basal
notching, along with eight distal fragments.

Thirty-eight miscellaneous unifaces con-sisted
of small flakes (<43 mm in length) of various
shapes, some with steep bit ends and others with
converging, pointed edges (similar to gravers).

Bifaces and Preforms
Seventeen bifaces (including fragments) were
recovered, several that appear to have been refurbished. These include a large, crudely chipped
biface (Figure 13b); a large biface distal fragment
(Figure 13c) that has been chipped on one lateral
surface and may have been used as a knife; and a
smaller biface/preform (Figure 13a). The three specimens are made from light gray chert. Another is a
large lanceolate biface with a diagonal fracture resulting in the loss of one lateral surface; the distal tip
is also missing. Five preforms, four intact (Figure
14a-c, e ), are ovate in form and have rounded bases.

basalt), has cortex on the dorsal surface, and is
heavily patinated.

Modified Blades
Of the three modified blades from the site, one
has edge damage on both lateral surfaces; the second has one edge trimmed and one unmodified;
and the third has a distal tip that has been trimmed
to a point and both lateral edges are chipped. The
remaining four specimens are blade fragments; one
has a notched (denticulate) edge.

Perforators
Four perforator fragments (all with broken distal tips) were found at San Bernardo North. One is
made on a flake and has a bifacial shaft (Figure
17a), and another was made from a side-notched
dart point (Figure l 7b ). A third perforator is made
on a flake (Figure 17c). The final perforator is
bifacial and has an alternately beveled bit end
(Figure 17d). The perforators range from 18-33
mm in width and 5.8-7.0 mm in thickness, and
weigh 3.6-5 g.

Gunflints
Three gunflints from San Bernardo North are
bifacial; one is unifacial. Two are nearly square and
two are rectangular forms. Three specimens (see
Figure 17e-g) are bifacial and made from a gray
chert; the fourth (see Figure l 7h) is made from a
light tan chert, and is unifacial. Metric data for the
gunflints are provided in Table 5.

Eleven ground stone tools or fragments were
recovered: five hammerstones, two metate fragments, and four manos. The metate fragments were
of a dark gray coarse-grained vesicular basalt (see
Inman 1997:Figure 28). Other ground stone tools
included a loaf-shaped two-handed mano (see Inman
1997:Figure 27), mano fragments of native limestone (Figure 18b) and basalt (see Inman 1997:Figure 29a), and a hammerstone with edge battering
(Figure 18a). A heavy, round pebble (probably galena or hematite) was also recovered that had considerable polish (burnishing) and faint scratches on
all surfaces. This oval-shaped stone may have been
used as a tool for burnishing and smoothing surfaces and/or interiors of pottery vessels.

Modified Flakes
Modified flakes recovered from the San

flakes have patterned, repeated, edge trimming or

The 10 bifaces include three crudely bifaced
flakes; one large, crude biface (a possible quarry
blank); one biface fragment (proximal); one medial
fragment made from white chert (or possibly
chalcedony); and a heavily patinated bifacial
preform fragment with a snap fracture on the
proximal end. The remaining three specimens are
crudely bifaced flakes.

A heavy, rectangular polished stone galena
fragment (similar to a specimen from Mission San
Juan Bautista) was found at San Bernardo East.
Also recovered was the leg of a large metate; one
rectangular "loaf-shaped" two-handed mano
fragment (of vesicular basalt), with convex
grinding surfaces on both sides; a sandstone mano;
a hammerstone fragment of purple quartzite; and
one additional mano fragment, ovate and bi-convex

Unifaces
Of the three unifaces from San Bernardo East,
one specimen has modified lateral surfaces and bit
end (side and end scraper); the second tool, a
possible gunflint, is small, thick, rectangular, and
chipped on two lateral edges; and the third uniface
is made on a thick flake. This specimen has one
trimmed edge with heavy battering and sootstaining.
Cores
There are four cores from San Bernardo East
(see Table 7). These include one small fragment of
fine-grained brown chert, and an expended and conical core, with flakes removed from 80 percent of its
circumference. The third core is stream-rolled, rectangular, with a platform created at one end, and
flakes/blades removed from one face. The remaining chert core (a cobble with battered cortex) has a
multi-faceted platform with several flakes removed,
as well as several hinge fractures attesting to the
attempted removal of additional flakes. The cores
are from cobbles (34-59 mm in length, 32.5-43.5
mm in width, and 14.6-51 mm in thickness) weighing between 30-132 g.

Summary of Lithic Artifacts from
San Bernardo North and
San Bernardo East
Lithics from San Bernardo represent an occupation spanning 92 years (1702 to 1794 ). A
large number of Guerrero arrow points (n=65)
and seven miscellaneous arrow point forms were
recovered. It is likely that the dart points present
were collected from nearby Archaic sites and
were either being refurbished or used in their
original form (perhaps as knives). As at San Juan
Bautista, local river cobbles were being selected
and the bi-polar method (hammer and anvil) of
knapping was employed on smaller cobbles as
well as a core-flake technology. Bifaces and preforms are present as well as two formal unifacial
end scrapers and one uniface that is chipped on
one lateral surface and the bit end (end and side
scraper). It is probable that the larger bifaces and
formal scrapers also represent curated tools from
the Archaic era. Specialized tools include perforators and gunflints. The small perforators are
similar to those found in Late Prehistoric sites
across South Texas. It is likely that some of the
gunflints from the site were of European origin,
imported by the Spanish, and that others represent ancient technology being used to produce a
new tool form.

USE= WEAR ANALYSIS OF SELECT
LITHIC ARTIFACTS
Use-wear analysis was conducted on select
chipped stone artifacts (unifaces, edge modified
flakes, and one blade fragment) from San Juan
Bautista and San Bernardo. Results of high
magnification microscopy (220X) on 29 artifacts
indicated that the majority of these tools exhibited
some degree of use-wear, usually in the form of
generic polish. More diagnostic use-wear indicators
on some tools show that various food processing
and material processing tasks (butchering, scraping,
cutting, sawing) were taking place at the Guerrero
missions. These probably included processing of
animal products (meat and hides) and wood and
plant processing.
Small unifaces had more evidence of use-wear
than the modified flakes, supporting the idea that
the modified flakes were casual tools used for a
short period of time and then discarded. The small
unifacial tools (thumbnail in size) appear to have
been re-sharpened and used till they were extremely
small, then discarded when snap fractures occurred
or the bit end could no longer be re-sharpened.
Perhaps the finding of poorly developed polish on
the majority of tools is characteristic of the mission
context, with metal tools being used for some tasks.
In addition, it is likely that the processing of meat
and hides was taking place outside the mission compound in an area that was not excavated. More indepth information regarding the use-wear analysis
can be found in Inman (1997:87-97).

SUMMARY
The Native Peoples
The names of the diverse cultural groups living
at the Guerrero missions beginning in 1700 are
recorded in various Spanish documents. Campbell
(1979) identified 88 Native American groups
derived from both northeastern Mexico and
southern Texas. The earliest report of Apache
movement resulting in the displacement of Native
groups from the Southern High Plains southeastward to the Edwards Plateau took place in
1683-1684. It is likely that the individuals at the
Guerrero missions were remnants of numerous

379

groups who, in prehistoric times, had lived in the
immediate area and other groups who, having
already suffered displacement, were taking refuge
there (Campbell n.d.).
In general, total population numbers for San
Juan Bautista and San Bernardo did not exceed
300-400 individuals at each mission (Campbell and
Campbell 1996). Mission documents indicate that
migrations by the Native peoples between missions
was common; Campbell and Campbell ( 1996) noted
that some cultural groups were included in census
reports at as many as five or six different missions.
For example, research by Ricklis (1992, 1996) on
the Karankawas, a Texas coastal group, indicates
that their adaptation to colonialism was to incorporate the missions into their traditional seasonal
rounds, and they might be at the missions for only a
few months out of the year. Further hindering determinations of population numbers in the Guerrero
missions is that some Spanish reports recorded only
births, marriages, deaths, and numbers of individuals who were religious converts.

Occupation Dates of the Sites
The archeological record at San Juan Bautista
reflects an occupation of 54 years (1740-1794) and
San Bernardo was occupied continuously for at least
92 years (Inman 1997:Figure 59). Similar lithic
artifact forms are found at both sites, although predictably in reduced numbers at the more short-lived
mission of San Juan Bautista. In order to have comparable data from the same periods of occupation
and to examine the early years of missionization of
the Native peoples, cultural materials from the second location of San Juan Bautista (1700-1740)
should be studied. It appears, however, that the site
is beneath one of the buildings of the modem-day
town plaza. Additionally, if data were available
from the short-lived Mission San Francisco de
Solano, these too may provide insights into the
lithic forms and technology used during the early
mission years.

The Lithic Technology
The disparate bands of cultural groups at the
missions left an archeological record that attests to
their continued manufacture and use of stone tools,

380

and to their adoption and use of a single arrow
point style (Guerrero) during the mission era. The
presence of stone tools, lithic debris, manos and
metates, and a faunal record with abundant wild
game indicates that although domesticated animals
(cattle, goats, sheep) were introduced by the Spanish, hunting and gathering continued to be an important aspect of Native subsistence. During times
of scarcity, it is certain that the Spanish also relied
on hunting and foraging.
The extent of the importance of stone tool technology over time in the mission setting is difficult
to assess due to various factors affecting the archeological deposits at the missions, including: the
apparent sweeping clean of floor surfaces in the
Native habitation structures that mixed artifacts in
cultural deposits outside doorways and windows;
the numbers of different cultural groups moving
through the missions; the extended period of occupation; and the removal of building stones after the
mission was abandoned, which displaced surface
materials and degraded the stratigraphy in the shallow deposits.
Lithic technology (Hester 1977) represented at
the mission sites includes the bifacial reduction of
cobbles; a core/flake industry (flakes detached from
prepared cores were used in the production of
unifacial and bifacial tools); and a limited core/
blade industry. In addition, the bi-polar flaking technique was used (Crabtree 1972; Honea 1965). The
bi-polar technique consists of holding a small to
medium-sized pebble core vertically on an anvil
and striking the top of the core with a hammerstone.
Using this technique, force is induced from both
the anvil and the percussor, causing cones of force
to form at both ends of the pebble or cobble, not
necessarily leaving cone scars. When the force is in
direct opposition, the cones exceed the elastic limit
of the material and it shatters. The debris will include flakes or chunks that resemble segments of
an orange (Crabtree 1972). The debitage from San
Juan Bautista and San Bernardo includes distinctive wedge-shaped flakes. Fox (1979) noted the use
of bi-polar technology at Mission San Jose in San
Antonio. With minimal flaking, these wedge flakes
could be made into gunflints. It is possible that this
particular type of lithic technology, used in prehistoric times because it was well suited to available
materials (local small river cobbles), resulted in a
by-product that could be easily modified and used
for a new technological purpose.

The Lithk Toolkit
While a small number of bifaces (and very few
blades) was present at the Guerrero missions, there
appears to have been an emphasis on informal tools
made from flakes. These expedient tools, minimally
chipped to provide cutting and scraping edges, along
with small unifacial tools, appear to have comprised the majority of the lithic utilitarian implements. This may mean that it was no longer
necessary to produce more formal tools (for example, scrapers) because the Spanish were providing metal implements, although this is difficult to
confirm from the archeological record. Only a small
number of metal tools were noted in mission inventories and these records highlight the scarcity of
metal implements at the mission. The metal tools
that were present would have been refurbished and
reused until only small fragments survived.
The core/flake technology at the missions reflects a continuity from Late Prehistoric sites in
South Texas (Hester and Hill 1975; Inman et al.
1995, 1998). The few Late Prehistoric arrow point
styles found in the mission deposits have some
Toyah horizon (Black 1986) characteristics.
Both San Juan Bautista and San Bernardo have
a unique lithic form: the Guerrero arrow point. Two
variations of these stemless points are present: triangular and lanceolate. Guerrero points, for which
the Guerrero missions are the type site (Hester 1977,
1989), are also found at southern Texas missions,
including Mission Espiritu Santo (both Goliad and
Mission Valley [41VT11]), all five missions at San
Antonio, at Mission San Lorenzo (Tunnell and
Newcomb 1969) in Real County, at Mission San
Xavier (Gilmore 1969) in Milam County on the
Blackland Prairie, and at an historic site (the
Shanklin site, 41 WH8) in Wharton County (Hudgins
1986). Six Guerrero points (five triangular and one
lanceolate) were recovered from excavations at
Rancho de Las Cabras (41WN30), the ranch associated with Mission Espada (Ivey and Fox 1981;
Labadie n.d.).
The triangular form of the Guerrero point is
predominant at the Guerrero missions (although San
Bernardo has two specimens that are lanceolate).
Lanceolate forms were recovered from Espiritu
Santo (Mission Valley) while both triangular and
lanceolate forms were found at Espiritu Santo, the
Goliad location. Hester et al. (1996) hypothesized
that the lanceolate form may represent the lithic

Inman - Lithic Artifacts of the Native Americans at the Spanish Colonial Missions
technology of the Aranama, one of three (and the
most numerous) Native groups at both the Mission
Valley (41VTl1) and Goliad locations of Espiritu
Santo. The lanceolate and the triangular forms from
Espiritu Santo (Goliad) are particularly well made.
The Guerrero points from the San Antonio missions are generally triangular in form and sometimes crudely chipped.
Ethnohistoric research by Campbell (1988)
indicates that, in a 1708 report by Espinosa, San
Juan Bautista is mentioned as a major regional trade
center. In addition, Campbell's (n.d.) ethnohistoric
study of a southern Texas cultural group, the
Pacuache, whose homeland appears to have been
approximately 40 km northeast of the Guerrero
missions, links the Pacuache with a thriving bison
and deer hide trade at the San Juan Bautista presidia
and associated missions. This trade is described in
terms of exchanges with Native peoples living
across the Rio Grande in present-day Texas. The
archeological record from both Espiritu Santo
locations (41 VTl 1 and 41 GD l) contains large
numbers of scrapers to support this documentation.
In addition, historical records mention the cattle
industry at both these sites and it is likely that
cowhides were also being processed for use and
trade. The following passage by Espinosa (1709) is
excerpted from Campbell (n.d.):
They are much inclined to the chase, the
men engaging in no other occupation.
The women are trained to cure and tan
the hides of buffalo and deer. These they
curiously paint to trade to the Spaniards ...
the red and yellow dirt with which the
Indians paint their hides ... is very hard.
This ethnohistoric data can be combined with
research by Creel (1991) that suggests that the
occurrence of beveled knives and end scrapers in
assemblages dating after A.D. 1300 reflects the
importance of bison hides in a widespread trade
network in the early historic period in the Southern
Plains and adjacent areas.
When the extremely small number of formal
scrapers (two from San Bernardo) and the documented small amount of metal tools brought by the
Spanish are considered in light of this extensive
trade network, questions arise regarding hide-processing. It appears that workshop areas for bison or
deer hide-processing may have been located away

381

from the mission compound and therefore were not
excavated. Another possibility is that the hides were
being processed elsewhere (i.e., at the Goliad location of Espiritu Santo, where more formal scrapers
were recovered) and transported (along with
Guerrero points?) to the Guerrero missions to be
traded. Large pieces of the mineral red ochre have
been found at the Espiritu Santo mission in Goliad
that may have been used for decoration of hides.

CONCLUSIONS
The Native peoples living at San Juan Bautista
and San Bernardo represent both local and displaced
remnants of different cultural groups. A continuity
of technology from the Late Prehistoric period of
South Texas. is evident in the mission lithic
assemblages in the form of a core/flake industry.
At San Juan Bautista and San Bernardo, the
lithic artifacts, chipping debris, and abundant faunal
remains of wild game attest to the retention of
traditional lifeways through continued stone tool
manufacture and use. Use-wear analysis of some
stone tools from the two mission sites provides
evidence for the processing of animal products
(hide-processing and butchering), plant products,
and wood. Artifacts of chipped glass and gunflints
for Spanish-introduced arms document aspects of
acculturation, namely the use of traditional
technology on a new material, and the use of
traditional technology and materials for the
manufacture of a new product. Ground stone tools
indicate plant food processing also continued to
play a part in Native subsistence.
Historical documents attest to the retention of
other cultural practices: the Natives would leave
the mission to perform their ritual dances (mitotes)
and to hunt and gather (Weddle 1968). Mission
documents from 1727 indicate a food shortage so
that while hunting was part of traditional culture, it
was also a necessity during this period. Fauna!
analyses (Davidson and Valdez 1976) verified that
bone marrow extraction continued, although it
appeared that food was available in sufficient
quantity most of the time. These remains also
indicate that there was an extremely heavy
dependence on wild game, supplemented by
domesticated fauna. The large amount of amphibian,
reptile, and small bird bones suggest that the Native
peoples still spent a considerable amount of time

382

foraging. Rodents, rabbit, deer, peccary, and
possibly bison were heavily hunted. Concentrations
of Rabdotus snails and freshwater mussel shells
were also found in midden areas at San Juan
Bautista. An historic account by Espinosa
(Campbell n.d.) described snails, rabbits, and rats
as foods offered by the local Native peoples to
missionaries at the short-lived original site of San
Juan Bautista on the Rio Sabinas (1699)
It appears the Guerrero point was introduced
at San Juan Bautista and San Bernardo early in
their history and quickly spread throughout the
South Texas and Central Texas missions system.
The mobility of the Native peoples during the
mission era (Campbell and Campbell 1996) was
certainly conducive to the spread of goods and
technology. The crowding together in small
housing areas at the missions would also have
resulted in considerable cultural exchange and
standardization (Hagan 1961).
Examination of laboratory notes and sketches
indicates that the few metal point forms introduced by the Spanish and found at the missions,
were not the origin of the Guerrero point, for they
greatly varied in form (see Harris et al., this volume). It is unlikely, therefore, that they were the
model for the standardized Guerrero point.
Further research of mission lithic assemblages
is warranted, as well as regional syntheses, to determine the origin of the Guerrero arrow point and
the mechanisms behind its acceptance and widespread use by all ethnic groups during the mission
era. In addition, combined archeological and historical research should be conducted to arrive at a
better understanding of changes in lithic toolkits
that took place during the mission era.

A Study of Glass Beads, Coral Beads, and Bead Spacers
from the San Juan Bautista and San Bernardo
Missions, Guerrero, Coahuila, Mexico

ABSTRACT
During the 1975-1976 excavations at Missions San Bernardo and San Juan Bautista (Guerrero, Coahuila),
546 trade beads, 13 coral beads, and 11 brass bead spacers were recovered. Their contexts are almost entirely
mission Indian habitation areas at the two missions and the age determinations derived from these materials
reflect the 18th century use of these missions. Certain bead types and the brass bead spacers almost always occur
south of the Rio Grande, while the bulk of the bead types are shared with other Texas missions of the Spanish
Colonial era.

INTRODUCTION
From 1975-1976, excavations were carried out
at Missions San Juan Bautista and San Bernardo,
near the present-day town of Guerrero, Coahuila
(Figure 1). This was part of the Gateway Project, a
series of archeological and ethnohistorical investigations carried out under the terms of a permit from
the Direccion de Monumentos Historicos del
Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia. Funding came largely from the National Endowment for
the Humanities, the Kathryn Stoner O'Connor Foundation, and the Sid Richardson Foundation.
Several summaries of the project have appeared
in print (Adams 1975, 1976, 1977, 1980; Eaton
1981, 1989; Hester 1977, 1989; Hester and Eaton
1990), along with monographs on the ethnohistory
of the missions (Campbell 1979) and Spanish colonial history (Almaraz 1979,1980). In addition, a
bilingual summary of the research and a guide to
the missions, as well as the town of Guerrero (the
location of the former Presidio del San Juan
Bautista del Rio Grande del Norte), was published
by Eaton (1981). Most recently, Inman (this volume) has studied the mission Indian lithic materials from the two sites.
During the initial analysis of the material culture
found at the Guerrero missions, the late R. K. Harris,
and his wife, Inus Marie Harris, were asked to
examine the trade beads found in the excavation of

middens and living quarters related to the mission
Indians. The Harris' had long been respected
scholars in the study of trade beads (e.g., Harris and
Harris 1967, 1974) and carried out the analysis
reported here, providing the Gateway Project with
a manuscript in 1978. The delay in publication has
resulted largely from the desire to publish color
illustrations of the beads, in order to make the
Harris' study more useful for comparative studies
with other missions in the Texas-Mexico
borderlands. Much of the text that follows is
derived from the Harris and Harris manuscript of
1978, with editing and additions by Hester.

METHODS OF MANUFACTURING
GLASS BEADS
Before presenting the analysis of the glass
beads, we will discuss methods of manufacture
and other terms used herein. The major technical
problem in the mass production of glass beads is
that of finding some simple and practical means
of forming the perforations by which the beads
are strung. Two basic methods of accomplishing
this end have been devised, and have been in use
for centuries.
One of the methods is to draw out a hollow
glass tube and then to break the tube into beadlength sections. A second method is to apply viscous

to form a central hollow that runs
the entire length of the cane. A
cane produced in this manner may
be more than 300 feet long. After
the cane has been broken into sections about two feet long to facilitate handling, the breaking of the
cane sections into bead-length
pieces proceeds in the following
manner, as described by Lardner

Harris, Harris, and Hester -A Study of Glass Beads, Coral Beads, and Bead Spacers
Structurally, hollow-cane beads may be either
simple or compound, with layering being the standard technique for fashioning the compound varieties. In making layered beads by the hollow-cane
method, the same procedure is followed as described
above, except that the initial cylinder, which is
shaped from the paraison, is dipped into molten
glass of a second color just before the cane is drawn
out. As a result, the cane emerges with a veneer of
this second kind of glass superimposed over the
core component. Multiple layers can be formed by
additional dippings. (In several archeological reports, each of the different layers in a bead has been
called a cane. This, however, is not in accordance
with standard usage among glass manufacturers;
therefore, it is suggested that the term cane be used
in reference to the whole tube, whether simple or
compound, and layer in reference to the individual
concentric components.)
Inlay, usually of stripes in the case of hollowcane beads, is achieved by laying slender, solid
canes of colored glass longitudinally along the surface of the initial cylinder and pressing them in
firmly. Then, when the cane is drawn out, the slender inlaid canes are drawn along with it and appear
on the finished beads as inlaid stripes. If the tube is
twisted as it is drawn, the stripes will come out
spiraled around the bead in the manner of stripes
around a barber pole.
In cross-section, the shape of the cane may be
round or polygonal. Some of the faceted beads are
made from hexagonal canes by cutting or grinding
facets on each end of the bead, leaving the original
shape of the cane in the middle (Woodward 1965:9).

The Mandrel-Wound Method
In making beads by this method, molten glass
is formed around a mandrel (bar or shaft) and, after
the glass has cooled, the mandrel is removed, leaving a perforation through the bead. We have been
unable to locate any detailed description of the techniques by which the glass is actually formed around
the mandrel, but probably the mandrel-wound beads
were made by rolling a thread or ribbon of molten
glass around a revolving mandrel so as to build up
the body of the bead, in much the same manner as
yarn is rolled onto a spindle. Since the mandrelwound method is inefficient-as compared to the
hollow-cane method-for making seed beads, it is
seldom if ever used for that purpose.

387

Structure

In spite of their small size, some glass beads
are made up of numerous structural components.
Most striped Cornaline d' Aleppo beads (Harris
Types No. 67 and No. 68), for example, contain at
least 38 distinct structural elements: three sets of
stripes, each set consisting of three separate stripes,
and each stripe made up of four or five tiny glass
rods (minimum of 36 tiny rods); plus a core of
green glass, a layer of opaque red glass, and
sometimes a thin veneer of transparent glass on
the surface.
Simple beads are those composed of a
monolithic, structurally undifferentiated mass
of glass. Both hollow-cane and mandrel-wound
forms are common.
Compound beads are those consisting of two
or more concentric layers of glass, one over the
other. These are normally hollow-cane beads.

COUNTRY OF ORIGIN
The problems involved in trying to determine
the countries where beads were manufactured
between 1700 and 1850 are especially perplexing.
Woodward (1965:4) states, "In general, the bulk of
the glass beads, traded on the North American
continent from the 16th until around the first half of
the 19th centuries, were made in the glass factories
of Murano, Venice" (Dubin [1995:39] states that
Venice dominated the world bead market until the
20th century). This is undoubtedly an accurate
statement with regard to the trade beads of the 16th,
17th, and early 18th centuries, but it may not fully
apply to the period of our particular concern, which
is roughly 1700-1830. With the fall of the
commercial Republic of Venice in the 1730s, it is
reported that the glass production of Murano
declined drastically, until by about 1735 what had
once been a flourishing enterprise supporting 300
glass houses was quickly reduced to less than 20
(Rodgers and Beard 1937:40). During that time,
many of the Italian bead makers reportedly moved
to other European countries, including England,
Holland, Belgium, France, and Spain, where some
of them were employed in glass factories. Because
of the secrecy of the guilds that surrounded the
manufacture of beads, it will be extremely
difficult-perhaps impossible-to ever unravel the
historical details concerning the places where 18th

388

Texas Archeological Society

and 19th century trade beads were manufactured
(Dubin 1995:39). Possibly the changes in bead types
between Time Periods 1 (1700-1740) and 2 (17401767) reflect this shift in locus of manufacture (cf.
Harris and Harris 1967).

[TARL]). Figure 2 was composed from scanned
images done by Robin Benson (TARL) from the
Smithsonian color prints.
It should be noted that bead surfaces are frequently altered by age and weathering, and it is
sometimes difficult to determine the original
color. However, the color can often be restored
by immersing the bead in a weak solution of
muriatic acid for about two hours and then washing it in water. It is surprising how many beads
that would have otherwise been classified as
dirty-white turn out to be red, green, yellow, or
blue when cleaned.
General terms are used to describe the bead
shapes: barrel-shaped, donut-shaped, round, and
tube-shaped (bugle). Some of the larger (necklace)
beads are described as being olive-shaped. This
term was taken from an early 18th century document (Thwaites 1959: 143) and was apparently

widely used by the French to describe certain of the
trade beads.
There is documentary evidence that mission
Indians used the larger beads mainly for necklaces
and the small and medium-sized ones principally
on skins, garters, and the like. The large beads will
here be referred to as necklace beads, while the
medium and small ones are called garter beads. The
beads were sorted into size groups as follows (the
measurements are for bead diameter, perpendicular
to the hole axis; length is disregarded in the Harris
classification): 0-2 mm=extra small; 2-4 mm=small;
4-6 mm=medium; and over 6 mm=large.
At the end of each type description, it will be
indicated whether the bead is tumbled (that is, as in
the manufacturing process described above),
untumbled (with ends left sharp), and/or twisted
(while the hot canes were being stretched lengthwise). The abbreviations T, UT, and TW will be
used to indicate the respective processes (Harris
and Harris 1967: 139).

The 547 glass trade beads found at San Juan
Bautista and San Bernardo comprise 20 types using the bead charts of R. King and Inus Marie

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
GLASS BEAD TYPES
Structure

Of the 20 bead types from San Juan Bautista
and San Bernardo, Types 10, 10-A, 15, 46, 48, 50,
53, 62, 81, 82, 83, 84, 88-A, and 164 are made up
of one layer of glass (simple structure). Types 5,
45, 51, and 57 are made up of two layers of glass
(compound structure).
Methods of Manufacture

Of the 20 glass bead types at San Juan Bautista
and San Bernardo, Types 5, 10, 10-A, 15, 44, 45,
46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 57, 62, 81, 82, 83, 84 and 164
were made by the hollow-cane method. Types 53
and 88-A were made by the mandrel-wound method.
Beads Overheated in Tumbling

In Operation (Op.) 101-T-2 at San Juan Bautista
(a linear apartment structure built for mission Indians), two beads of Type No. 48 were found fused
together. In Op. 9-D- l (midden near mission Indian
apartments) at San Bernardo, two beads of Type
No. 50 were found fused together. In both of these
cases, when the cut beads were placed in sand and
ashes in a drum for tumbling, they were heated too
hot, and the beads fused together.

DISCUSSION OF GLASS BEADS:
TIME PERIODS
In this section, the utility of bead types as
time markers will be discussed. Some bead types
are not definitive of a certain time period, but
extend through three or four of the periods recognized here (see below). For example, some types
of small garter beads may be present in about the
same percentage from about 1700 to around 1836.
In general, it can be said that the most definitive
bead types are the medium and large-size complex, striped ones, and the medium and large-size
faceted forms. However, a few small bead types
are definitive. Sometimes a bead type may come
into the trade in large numbers in a certain time
period, and drop down to very small numbers in
the following time periods.

Harris, Harris, and Hester-A Study of Glass Beads, Coral Beads, and Bead Spacers
The time periods utilized by Harris and Harris
(1967: 130) are: Period l: 1700-1740; Period 2: 17401767; Period 3:1767-1820; Period 4: 1820-1836, and
Period 5: 1836-1850. In discussing the various proveniences we will use the word "Operation" to refer to the locality in which the beads were found.
"Operations" (Op. or Ops.) and "Suboperations"
(Subops.) were used to designate excavation units,
trenches, and other proveniences during the Gateway Project (see Eaton 1989).

391

1700-1836. Type Nos. 53 and 164 are present in
very small numbers and probably date around
1740.
From the above feature data, it appears that
nine of the operations at San Juan Bautista date
from roughly 1740 to 1767. Indeed, the mission
was established at its present location in 1740 and
continued in use until around 1810. Although we
have few data on the Indian populations at San
Juan Bautista, research by Campbell (1979:59) reports a census of 238 individuals in 1772.

Contexts of Beads at
San Juan Bautista

Contexts at San Bernardo

Most of the beads at San Juan Bautista come
from an area of the mission church, Op. 100-Q,
which was likely the baptistry (Almaraz 1980:6).
Operation 101 is a linear apartment structure used
as mission Indian quarters, with a bastion (101-W)
at the west end. In 1772, the Indian quarters are
described as built of stone (Almaraz 1980:14); Op.
105 is a mission Indian midden deposit, not far
from Op. 101.
Op. 100-Q has Type Nos. 5, 10, 15, 46, and
164. Type Nos. 5, 10, 15, and 164 indicate a time
period between 1700-1740. Type No. 46 is not a
good time indicator, as it dates from 1700-1836.
Additionally, since this location of San Juan Bautista
was not constructed until 1740, these types either
have a longer time span that once thought or were
brought from the earlier location.
Op. 101-W-l (bastion) has only one specimen, Type No. 45. This type dates from 17001836, and is not a good time indicator. Since the
1772 inventory does not mention the bastion
(Almaraz 1980:14), it was likely built late in the
18th century.
Op. 105-D-3 (midden) has only one specimen,
Type No. 57. This type dates from 1740-1767,
consistent with its context at San Juan Bautista.
Ops. 101-P-2, 101-R-1, 101-R-3, 101-S-3,
101-S-4, 101-T-2, 101-U-1, 101-U-3, and 105-B1 (Indian quarters, separate Indian house mound
[101-R; Structure III], and associated middens)
have four types of glass beads present that are
good time indicators: Type Nos. 81, 82, 83, and
84. They are present in various numbers in the
operations, and indicate a time period of 17401767. Type Nos. 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, and 51 are
not good time indicators as they each date from

At Mission San Bernardo, a great deal of excavation was done in linear mission Indian apartments, with six such structures (I-VI) constituting a
mission Indian pueblo in the northwest part of the
site. Op. 6 represents Structure IV and Op. 7, Structure VI. These stone and adobe structures were
apparently built after 1756, and by 1772 there were
40 houses forming two streets (Almaraz 1980:46).
Ops. 8 and 9 are mission Indian middens associated
with these structures.
Ops. 6-F-1, 9-C-1, and 9-D-1 have beads of
Type Nos. 81, 82, and 83 present. This would place
the operations in Time Period 2, or between 17401767. Type 88-A is a rosary bead dating to the
same period.
Ops. 7-A-1 has only two beads of Type No. 10A. This type dates from 1700 to 1740. It would
have been nice to have had a larger sample of beads
from this operation.
Op. 8-D-1 has Type Nos. 48, 50, and 51 present.
These types are not very definitive as to dating, as
they occur from 1740 to 1836. This operation, however, and Op. 6-F-l, each have one specimen of
Type No. 62 present. This type is very interesting
in that only two specimens of this type are known
from sites north of the Rio Grande. One is from the
Gilbert site, a Nortefio (Wichita) site in Rains
County, Texas, dating between ca. 1740 and 1767
(Jelks 1967). The other specimen comes from an
undated site near Colorado City, Texas. This bead
is the only historic item from the site (Skinner
1978:44).
About 1965 an artifact collector reportedly from
Dallas, Texas, Robert Shelton, excavated two 5
foot squares at the site of San Bernardo (probably
in the middens associated with the structures of the

392

Texas Archeological Society

Indian pueblo described above; notes by R. K.
Harris sent to T. R. Hester in 1978). He recovered
72 specimens of the Type No. 62 bead, along with
a spoon-shaped higo (R. K. Harris, personal
communication to Hester, September 15, 1978,
distinguished two types of higos, the spoon-shaped
[noted here] and the clenched-fist [fica] styles), and
five metal arrow points of the Benton type (Figure
3; Harris and Harris 1967: 160). Similar metal arrow
points were found in the Gateway Project
excavations in the Indian quarters area. The higo
and the metal points date from about 1740 to 1820.
From the above data, it can be seen that three
out of five operations at San Bernardo date about
1740-1767, while others date as early as 1700.
The mission was established in 1702 and was officially secularized in 1794; however, it continued
in operation for several years thereafter (in 17971798, there were 73 mission Indians still at San
Bernardo [Almaraz 1979:40]). There are widely

centimeters

varying figures given for the 18th century mission
Indian population at San Bernardo (e.g., Weddle
1968). Campbell (1979:59) reports a total population of 46 individuals in the 1734 census, growing
to 156 by 1772.

DISCUSSION OF CORAL BEADS
Ops. 101-R-1, 101-R-3, 101-S-4, and 101-T-2
(Indian quarters and middens) at San Juan Bautista,
and Op. 9-C- l (midden) at San Bernardo produced
13 small, round, or barrel-shaped beads made from
salmon-pink coral. The Harris' have records on one
site in Texas and one site in California where coral
beads are present. The Texas site is Mission Rosario
in Goliad County (Harris and Harris 1974:71), and
the California site is San Jose Mission (May 1977
Harris and Harris bead study). In a discussion with
Catholic priests, they are inclined to believe that

Harris, Harris, and Hester-A Study of Glass Beads, Coral Beads, and Bead Spacers
these are beads from rosaries given to the Indians.
At Mission Rosario these beads probably date between 1750-1780. They are probably dated around
1790 in California at Mission San Jose.

DISCUSSION OF BRASS
BEAD SPACERS
Ops. 101-P-2 and 101-T-2 at San Juan Bautista
(Indian quarters) produced 14 brass bead spacers.
In making these spacers, a tiny ring was made from
a brass wire. This was then hammered flat. These
spacers looked somewhat like a sequin used on
ladies' dresses. Under a magnifying glass one can
see the joint in the brass wire. In size, they vary
from about 2 to 3 mm in diameter. When beads
were strung, the spacers were placed between the
beads. The Harris' have never seen these bead spacers north of the Rio Grande.

CLOSING COMMENTS
Detailed descriptions of Spanish Colonial period glass trade beads, coral beads, and bead spacers have been presented for the missions of San
Bernardo and San Juan Bautista, at present-day
Guerrero, Coahuila. The analyses were done using
the Harris system and through referencing bead
boards prepared by R. K. and Inus Marie Harris.
Unfortunately, no comprehensive study of missionera trade beads has been done for Texas, making
comparative comments difficult. Fortunately, we
have been able to use color illustrations in this
paper, hopefully allowing broader comparisons by
scholars working at other sites.
The dating of the trade beads generally reflects
the known historic ages of both missions, with beads
of post-1740 age present at San Juan Bautista, while
the bulk of the earlier beads were at San Bernardo,
founded in 1702. The indication that some of the
bead types continue into the early 19th century is
not surprising, as both missions continued to work
with local Indian groups after the official orders of
secularization in 1794.
Two beads of Type No. 62 have been seen by
the Harris' only twice north of the Rio Grande, one
example coming from the Gilbert site. The coral
beads and brass bead spacers were also unusual in
terms of their occurrence at Guerrero. In addition,

393

Benton metal points, known mainly from the Red
River area, are reported here, based on a relicco llector' s unauthorized excavations at San
Bernardo in 1965. However, since these missions
were truly the "gateway to Spanish Texas" for many
decades, with a variety of Indian groups moving in
and out (Campbell 1979), and with trade going
back and forth through this area between Mexico
and Texas, it is not terribly surprising that artifacts
were found outside the realm of what might be
normally expected.

San Jose de Corralitos, A Spanish Colonial
Ranch in Zapata County, Texas

Sharon E. Fleming and Timothy K. Perttula

ABSTRACT
San Jose de Corralitos is a Spanish Colonial site located on the left or north bank of the Rio Grande near
Laredo. Associated with the 329,000 acre Spanish land grant to Jose Vasquez Borrego in 1750-1753, the ranch
at San Jose de Corralitos was developed by Borrego' s grandson, Jose Fernando Vidaurri. The site includes two
historic ranch buildings and archeological deposits dating to the late 18th and 19th centuries. The architectural
and archeological resources are discussed and a framework is posited for the architectural development of ranch
buildings during the colonial, post-colonial, and modem periods.

INTRODUCTION
The founding of ranch settlements in the mid18th century figured prominently in the overall strategy for colonizing Nuevo Santander (see Alonzo
1998; George 1975; Rocha 1997). Ranches located
in modem Zapata County, Texas were within the
original jurisdiction of the colonial town called
Revilla, now known as Guerrero Viejo, Mexico. A
significant number of these historic ranches were
inundated by Falcon Reservoir in the 1950s.
Along the Rio Grande's north bank, ranchers
were granted porci6nes, allotments of about 5,000
acres, with a single exception of the large tract
assigned to Jose Vasquez Borrego in 1750. The
subject property, San Jose de Corralitos, is a subgrant of the Nuestra Senora de los Dolores hacienda.
This study of San Jose de Corralitos, also called
"Los Corralitos," includes archival testimonies that
provide dates for permanent settlement of the ranch
in 1766 and for construction of the fortaleza, or
fort, by 1786. The archeological and architectural
analyses confirm the late 18th century origin of the
single-room building and occupation of the site,
thereby suggesting that Los Corralitos contains the
earliest known house or ranch building still standing in Texas. This conclusion contradicts the 1977
National Register nomination data that posits a late
19th century date of construction (1977 Los

Corralitos National Register of Historic Places
nomination form, on file at the Texas Historical
Commission), and the late 18th century age confers
a much greater historical and architectural significance to this site.
Architectural features of Building l fit into a
morphology of historic colonial and post-colonial
ranch buildings proposed by Fleming (1998:226237). The shift from a fortified building type to a
non-fortified building type is a critical architectural
distinction whose clarification may assist interpretation of other ranch buildings and architectural
remains in the lower Rio Grande region.

SPANISH COLONIAL SITES IN THE
REVILLA AND LAREDO
JURISDICTIONS
In the early 18th century, between New
Spain's colonized centers in Mexico and the outlying posts on the northern frontier, lay a great
unoccupied territory surrounding the Rio Grande
valley. The Spanish decided that this area must be
settled to discourage French settlement and possible English encroachment.
The King of Spain issued a royal edict on July
10, 1739 ordering the colonization of the Rio Grande
valley, and in 1746 he appointed Jose de Escandon

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 70 (1999)

396

Texas Archeological Society

as the leader of the colonizing venture. Escandon
determined that 14 settlements would be established
at selected locations; the settlers would originate
from nearby jurisdictions and would obtain numerous concessions in addition to a land grant; a Captain-General would supervise the military, civil, and
judicial requirements of each town, thus negating
the need for a presidia; and missionary responsibilities would be granted to the College of San
Francisco of Mexico and the College of Guadalupe
of Zacatecas.
The new province of Nuevo Santander was
the first among the Internal Provinces of New
Spain to be established by civilians as the leading
force rather than missionaries or soldiers. The royal
mandate dictated careful selection of families with
character and moral integrity from well established
ranch settlements in the province of Coahuila. To
attract such families, the first settlers were offered
allotments of both farm and pasture lands as well
as a bonus of 100 or 200 pesos to buy the implements necessary for the first year's use (Crawford
1925:44).
On October 10, 1750, Vincente Guerra, a
rancher from Monterrey, together with 40 families,
established the Villa San Ignacio de Revilla at a
site called Los Moros. The community was established near the junction of the Rio Grande and
Salado rivers. Within seven years, 29 ranches were
established within the jurisdiction of Revilla and it
contained 357 people (Sanchez 1994:27).
In a second wave of settlement, Don Tomas
Sanchez de la Barrera y Garza petitioned Escandon
to establish a town on the north bank at a ford
known as Paso de Jacinto. He, along with three
families from his ranch, reached the site on May
15, 1755, and began construction two days later.
By 1757, this settlement of Laredo was still quite
small, comprised of only 11 families numbering 85
person (Garcia 1970: 12).
In 1767, a Royal Commission was specially
appointed to award grants of land to settlers. These
grants included town lots and farm tracts (Almaraz
1978: 16). When the Commissioners surveyed
Laredo on June 25, 1767, there were 35 families
already living on the north bank of the Rio Grande.
An additional group of land grants was given
to a limited number of individuals between 1767
and 1810 in Nuevo Santander. Land on the north
side of the river was granted only for ranching and
grazing with the exception of the town of Laredo

(Vigness 1948: 13). The result was the establishment
of historic settlements such as Capitanef\o, Clarefio,
Ramirefio, and others in present Zapata County.
By 1795, the entire population of the province
was 30,450, and the total number of livestock
797,874. The populations of the colonial towns
were: Laredo, 636, Mier, 973, Camargo, 1,174,
Reynosa, 1,191, and Revilla, 1,079 (Jones 1979:69).
The population of Nuevo Santander dwarfed its
neighbor province, Tejas.
A census of the town of Laredo by Ildefonso
Ramon, mayor in 1819, noted a total of 1418 persons in the jurisdiction, making the city larger
than any on the north side of the Rio Grande other
than San Antonio de Bexar. Although the town
had tripled in size during the last three decades,
war with Native American groups had made living conditions very difficult. Ramon noted:
Of the forty-four ranches noted, thirtyseven of them are abandoned [depopulated], on account of the desolating war
that the barbarous Indians of the North
wage against us, and the other seven are
only being operated at great risk during
the seasons of planting, cultivating and
harvesting ... for before the revolution
against the [Spanish] Kingdom and before the barbarous Indians had begun
the hostilities that they are so frequently
making, they busied themselves in caring for their stock of all kinds, but many
of these have been exterminated, and
now they have nothing else to live upon
until the arrival of the troops that are
garrisoning in this place .. .In the prairies
are roaming a great number of wild
horses unbroken; there are also 160
mares that we have not been able to
groups in orderly manadas [bunches]
because we have been unable to give
them attention. Likewise, quite a lot of
cattle, the number of which cannot be
calculated because they are scattered far
and wide, and have reverted to the wild
state. Between two of our citizens who
were the principal ones to have a considerable number of them, they still have
1,000 head of sheep and goats, but they
have had to suffer in their efforts to maintain them, the death of some shepherds
and have to stand considerable expense,

Fleming and Perttula - San Jose de Corralitos, A Spanish Colonial Ranch in Zapata County
strengthened by the hope that when the
barbarous nations give us peace, they will
have a chance to make an increase in
these species, as it happened when times
were quiet, then all the citizens of this
place made great progress up to the time
of the declaration of the war against the
barbarous Indians (Green 1990:12-13).

ranching, such as Jose Fernando Vidaurri, success
carried the burden of defending their families and
stock at great effort and risk. The legacy of the
Vidaurri family-as mainfested in the architectural
and archeological remains at their ranch-provide
tangible physical evidence of their struggle.
Archival data

After the independence of Mexico from Spain
Jose Vasquez Borrego owned a large ranch
in 1821, no new towns were founded along the
known as Hacienda San Juan del Alamo located

However, like many colonial ranchers, his interests
lay northward. When Jose de Escandon announced
the colonization of Nuevo Santander, Borrego petitioned him for the right to settle at the juncture of
the Arroyo Dolores and the Rio Grande on its north
bank, eight leagues northwest of Revilla and 30
leagues downriver from the presidio at San Juan
Bautista. Strategically, the settlement was significant in its location on "the road which is the most
direct, best and safest from the new Kingdom of
Leon and the Province of Coahuila to the Fort of
the Espiritu Santo Bay on the Nueces River and the
other Missions" (Lott and Martinez 1953:129).
Borrego' s oldest son, Juan Jose Vasquez
Borrego, closed the agreement, which included exemption from taxes for 10 years on the huge land
grant situated in modern Webb and Zapata counties
(see Figure 1). The request for 50 sitios de ganado
mayor (a parcel for large stock totaling 4,428 acres)
and 25 sitios de ganado menor (a 1,985 acre parcel
for small stock) totaling over 270,000 acres was
fulfilled on August 12, 1750 when Escandon dedicated the grant. Twelve families from San Juan del
Alamo were present (Jackson 1986:24).
A nephew, Bartolome Borrego, was put in
charge of the settlement known as Rancho de
Nuestra Senora de los Dolores (Our Lady of Sorrows) located less than a hundred yards upriver
from the Arroyo Dolores. It was the first of many
ranch settlements on the north bank of the Rio
Grande in the new province of Nuevo Santander
and the only human habitation in a 100 mile radius.
A few years later, in 1753, Borrego asked
Escandon for additional tracts known as San
Ygnacio, named for the patron saint of Revilla, and
San Jose de Corralitos. As part of the agreement,
one or two boats "for conduct of the royal service
of the new colony" would be provided at the river
crossing by Borrego. He would also provide a water supply from the Rio Grande, Arroyo Dolores, or
Arroyo Salado to the open fields. With the addition
of the San Ygnacio and San Jose de Corralitos
tracts, Borrego's holdings totaled approximately
329,000 acres (Garcia 1970:2).
Settled by families accustomed to ranching on
the frontier, the Dolores hacienda quickly grew and
prospered. Escandon's visitation report in 1754
mentions that cattle raising was the principal occupation of the 123 residents of Dolores. Jose Tienda
de Cuervo' s official inspection report dated July
20, 1757 lists 23 families, totaling 122 persons all

living injacales. The livestock included 3000 head
of cattle, 3000 mares, 400 saddle horses, 1600
mules, and 1050 donkeys.
Don Jose Vasquez Borrego and his wife had
four children: Juan Jose, Macario, Fernando, and
Manuela (Garcia 1970:2). Manuela married Juan
Antonio Vidaurri and bore five children: Jose
Fernando, Jose Maria Margfl, Francisco, Jesus,
and Josefa. The oldest child of Manuela, Jose
Fernando, was raised by his grandfather, Jose
Vasquez Borrego.
Upon the death of Bartolome Borrego in 1765,
Jose Fernando Vidaurri Borrego, 22, married his
cousin's widow, Alejandra Sanchez, the daughter
of Captain Tomas Sanchez (Laredo Archives). The
newlyweds lived in Laredo for almost a year before
returning to live with Vidaurri's grandfather at El
Pato (South Texas Citizen 1934).
In 1766, Borrego ordered that the ranch known
as San Jose de Corralitos be vacated of stock so
that his grandson, Jose Fernando Vidaurri, and his
new bride could be given the property free and
clear. The couple immediately settled on the property and established a sucessful ranch.
After Don Jose Vasquez Borrego died in 1770,
Corralitos was the subject of dispute among the
heirs: Borrego's son, Fernando Borrego, and grandson, Jose Fernando Vidaurri (South Texas Citizen
1934). Relative to the litigation in 1786, Don Jose
Ignacio de Trevino, Justicia of Mier testified:
that sometime in the September of 66
[1766] the applicant settled the aforementioned ranch and pasture land of San
Jose de Corralitos with his own servants
and equipment[.] It is true that he placed
the fields in cultivation [and built] the

men who [the applicant] has kept until
this day at his own expense [.] With
these men the applicant has provided

living at the house of Commander
[Vasquez Borrego] his grandfather [on
the occasion of these events] and I was
no longer a toddler[. On such occasion]
the Commander requested again the
presence and assistance of Vidaurri
(who had left a few days before to the
place of El Pato taking all his possessions) because [the Commander, his
grandfather] could not be without
Vidaurri, as he told me many times, because he missed him so [. Because of
this request from his grandfather] said
Vidaurri continued to perform the same
duties for his grandfather without the
slightest conflict arising from the manner Vidaurri assisted and served him;[.]
This I declare before you with great esteem; because all that I have declared is
what I know (Andres n.d.:11).
Many children were born to Alejandra Sanchez
and Jose Fernando Vidaurri, including: Maria
Encarnacion, Maria Luz, Jose Fernando, Jr., Jose
Alejandro, Jose Ildefonso, Jesusa, and Guadalupe.
By 1782, the population of Corralitos had increased
to 66 residents while that of Dolores was reduced
to 29 residents. Don Jose Fernando Vidaurri was

399

known to have gotten along very well with the
Laredo priests (Brown and Cadena n.d.:6).
After the turn of the 19th century, the BorregoVidaurri family aligned themselves politically with
the insurgent priest, Father Hidalgo. As the revolution of Mexico against Spain began in 1810, Spanish troops were withdrawn from the area and Indian
raids on the settlement increased. In 1811, several
family members, including Macario Borrego and
Fernando Borrego, were arrested as suspects in the
revolution for the liberation of Mexico (Lott 1950).
During the Revolution, military defense of the
ranchers waned. In response to recurrent Indian
attacks, in 1814, Jose Maria Margfl Vidaurri,
Fernando's brother, built a stone tower, or torre6n,
at Dolores. Cylindrical stone towers were typical of
colonial presidios until the 1772 presidio realignment on the frontier (Moorhead 1975:161-165). The
tower's advantages, however, were insufficient to
sustain the community against assailants. In 1818,
Margil Vidaurri lost his oldest son to an Indian
attack; the family was forced to abandon Dolores
and retreat to Corralitos.
In 1829, after the Mexican Republic was established, the original Vasquez Borrego land grant
was reaffirmed and partitioned into three large subdivisions that fronted on the river. The Dolores
Subdivision, the most northerly tract, was set aside
to Jose Maria Margil Vidaurri. The San Ygnacio
Subdivision was set aside to Fernando Borrego.
The Corralitos subdivision "embraces about 1,000
varas wide, from said San Francisco Hills on the
southeast, across said Corralitos Subdivision, to the
'Lomas del Difunto Flores' on the northwest boundary line of said Corralitos Subdivision." It was
awarded to the children and heirs of Jose Fernando
Vidaurri: Jose Alejandro Vidaurri and his wife,
Leonor Canales, as well as his son Laureano and
his wife Trinidad Cuellar, and his other son, Juan
(Martinez 1950:3).
Laureano and Juan Vidaurri lived at the
Corralitos ranch until their death in about 1882.
The son of Laureano Vidaurri, Alejandro, was
shot in 1889 by the foreman of La Perla, a ranch
established by the Bruni family on the former
Dolores hacienda. Alejandro and other members
of the Vidaurri family were buried at a small
family cemetery.
Mr. Everett Love of Laredo purchased
Corralitos in 1917 from the surviving children
of Laureano Vidaurri: Narciso Vidaurri and his

400

wife Adela Garcia de Vidaurri, Jesus Maria
Vidaurri, and Soledad Vidaurri. In 1939, Mr.
Harvey Mecom of Liberty County purchased the
Corralitos property, consisting of about 5000 acres,
from Everett Love et al. (Webb County deed
records). The ranch is currently owned by the descendants of Harvey Mecom.
Los Corralitos was surveyed by the Texas Historical Commission in 1976 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

Architectural Data
San Jose de Corralitos, or Los Corralitos, is
located in Zapata County, about 3 km north of
the town of San Ygnacio and 30 km south of
Laredo along Highway 83. The ranch occupies
about 5,000 acres surrounding the site of the
historic ranch buildings.
The historic ranch complex is situated within
about 100 m of the Rio Grande. It contains two
sandstone buildings with metal roofs, positioned at
right angles about 45 m apart, and several frame
structures, including a foreman's house, cowboy
quarters, and a metal shed located at the north side
of the complex.
"Building 1" is a single room structure with
thick sandstone walls, a single door, and six
gunports (Figure 2). These architectural features
are consistent with early fortified ranch buildings
(see below). Therefore, it is likely the fortaleza
constructed by Jose Fernando Vidaurri by 1786.
The fortaleza measures 33 feet long, 18 feet 4
inches wide, and 13 feet six inches high. It is located nearest to the river on the west side of the

Figure 2. Photo of general exterior, Building 1, Corralitos.

complex. A single splayed door opening, 3 feet
wide and 6 feet 2 inches high, with original framing, is located on the east elevation facing away
from the river.
Six gunports, or troneras, are regularly spaced
around the perimeter wall at about 3 feet above
the floor. The gunport openings are about 13 to 17
inches high and 24 to 49 inches wide at the interior, and reduce to an average height of about 8
inches near the exterior. The openings are lined
with single thin stones on the upper and lower
surfaces; the sides are splayed rubble masonry
lined with plaster. They appear to be oriented to
allow enfilade fire to the surrounding terrain (Figure 3).
The walls are constructed of roughly dressed
sandstone blocks with mud mortar. Sandstone
blocks at the four building corners are dressed at
two faces to provide a smooth corner. Between
the irregular sandstone blocks are smaller chinking stones to fill the gaps. The wall thickness
varies between 2 feet 5 inches and 2 feet 10 inches.
Both the interior and exterior walls were probably
plastered, limewashed, and decoratively painted.
Additional interior features include a niche on
the west wall, a wooden shelf set on projecting
wood brackets on the north wall and many rectangular wood blocks, or manitas, set into the masonry. The niche is almost 30 inches square in
elevation, and has a stone sill and wood lintel.
Although the roofing itself is typical, the framing system is unusual. The sawn wood members
spanning the width of the building do not bear
solely on the masonry wall. They are also end supported by a transverse beam resting on a series of
brackets or zapatas. The vigas, or beams, are now
missing, but pockets in the masonry indicate that
there were about 20, each 13 feet 9 inches long (or
5 varas) and 6 inches square.
A small portion of roofing material remains at
the northeast corner of the building interior. The
original roof construction appears to have been
terrado, or layered materials. First, 1 x 4 inch
boards were placed over and perpendicular to the
vigas. Next, small flat stone were mortared in place
and coated with a lime, sand, and pea-sized gravel
mixture known as chipichil. The finished roof surface sloped about 4 inches from east to west to
provide drainage.
The west elevation features five equally spaced
canales, or roof drains, at the base of the projecting

parapet. The roof drains, similar to the gunports,
are formed by a wide splayed opening at the interior wall surface that reduces to a narrow opening
in the exterior wall surface. The projecting wood
gutters are now missing.
Another unique architectural feature illustrates
the defensive capacity of the fortaleza. Recessed
into the top ledge of the parapet are six battlementstyle firing positions. Their use afforded protection
to defenders firing from the roof.
Building l has been modified in the 20th
century with the addition of a corrugated metal
addition, now reduced to only the west side, and a
portland cement cap on the parapet walls. A gabled,
wood framed, and corrugated metal roof replaced
the original roof. In addition, the original door and
most of the original interior and exterior plaster
surfaces have been lost.
Building 2, another historic sandstone building, is located on the south end of the complex, and
probably dates to the late 19th century. It measures
51 feet 10 inches x 20 feet 2 inches and contains
two rooms. It has two doors, one at the north elevation and one at the south. The opening at the south
elevation has hand-made double doors with beveled panels. The north elevation contains a modem
door. Heavy wooden lintels span both openings. It
has no gunports.
A ledge, or banqueta, 16-18 inches wide, comprised of chipichil with sandstone cobbles and a
large amount of aggregate, surrounds the building. Tie rods made from old plow parts were added
to provide lateral support to the upper walls.

The roof framing and construction is typical for a flat roofed building: wood beams span between the
end walls and are overlaid with a
board ceiling and chipichil. A later
shed addition exists on the south side
of the building. Building 2 is currently used as a storage barn.

ARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS AT SAN
JOSE DE CORRALITOS
(41ZP74)

Our June 6-7, 1998 investigations at Corralitos consisted of a
pedestrian survey and surface collection over approximately 5 acres around Buildings 1 and 2 at the ranch, along with the
excavation of 16 shovel tests (ca. 30-40 cm in
diameter) in areas where archeological materials
were apparent on the surface or suspected to be
shallowly buried in proximity to the buildings
(Figure 4). Surface conditions were excellent, as
the field immediately to the west of the buildings
had been recently plowed, a dirt road cut through
the Rio Grande terrace that enhanced visibility,
and there was an open gravel-covered area to the
east of Building 1 and north of Building 2 (see
Figure 4).
Although historic archeological materials are
not abundant on the surface at Corralitos, three
areas have been recognized that have historic ceramics and bone, as well as glass, metal, and other
artifacts. Area A is an elliptical area about 80 x 15
m in size around the north, south, and back (west)
sides of Building 1 (Figure 5). Area B covers ca. 50
x 20 m along the dirt road that leads to the Rio
Grande, in the road cutbank, and primarily on the
north side of the road, about 45 m northwest from
Building 1. The Area C artifact concentration is
much smaller in size than areas A and B, perhaps
20 x 15 m to the immediate north, south, and west
of Building 2 (see Figure 5).
Based on the kinds of historic artifacts found
in the surface collections and shovel testing,
including plain and decorated English whiteware
ceramics, mid-19th century Guanajuato Polychrome majolica, and olive green bottle glass, areas
A and C represent primarily archeological deposits

from an early to mid-19th
century residential occupation
at Corralitos. More recent
materials are also present on
the surface and shovel tests in
and around Building 1, such
as clear bottle glass, wire
nails, and gun cartridges, but
these are not considered here.
One Aranama Polychrome
(1750-1800) majolica sherd
was collected from the surface
in the vicinity of ST 9, about
30 m north of Building 1 (see
Figure 5).
Area B, on the other hand,
has archeological materials
from a Spanish Colonial
component that dates between ca. 1775-1825. The
late 18th-early 19th century
component is clearly associated with the construction
and early use of Building 1,
apparently built by 1786 (see
discussion above).This temporal estimate is based on the
kinds of Mexican ceramics
recovered from surface and
subsurface contexts, particularly the Mexican majolica
(loza blanca) from production centers in Puebla and
Guanajuato, Mexico (see
Carlson 1994; Fournier 1997),
and the Galera Polychrome
lead-glazed chocolate or bean
pots (Table 1).
Not including the animal
bones, 102 artifacts were recovered in the initial limited
investigations at Corralitos,
most of these from the road
surface collection, ST 11
(n=l8), and ST 16 (see Figure
5). Represented were plain
and decorated majolica, a burnished or polished redware
sherd from the Basin of
Mexico (Fournier 1997 :246)

that was manufactured in the 18th and 19th centuries, several kinds of lead-glazed earthenwares,
and hand-made unglazed earthenwares (Figure 6).
Late 18th-early 19th century majolica is
abundant in Area B. Included in the small
assemblage are five rim sherds of Aranama
Polychrome (1750-1800) with yellow and dark
brown bands (see Figure 6a-b), two Huejotzingo
Blue on White (1700-1850) rim sherds from ST
11 and ST 16, two San Elizario Polychrome (17501850) rim sherds (see Figure 6c-d), seven Puebla
Green on White (1780-1800) body sherds with
dark green flowers and petals (see Figure 6e), and
one distinctive Nopaltepec Polychrome/Monterey
Polychrome (1775-1825) body sherd from the
surface collection (see Carlson 1994: 117 and
Figure B5b; Fournier 1997:224 and Figure 8.2h).
This particular sherd has brown and black
horizontal lines and light orange bands with a
yellow floral motif outlined by brown lines (see
Figure 6f). One of the San Elizario rims is

1

classified as San Elizario Polychrome, green
variant (Fournier 1997:222 and Table 8.2), the
only difference being a green band replaces the
blue bands edged in black-brown lines documented
in the typical San Elizario Polychrome.
The few sherds of Guanajuato Polychrome
(see Table 1) date to the 19th century. There are
also two other 19th century majolica sherds from
the surface collection with light green bands.
Fournier (1997:228) suggests these are from plates
or bowls manufactured in Puebla and/or
Guanajuato, Mexico.
The lead-glazed Mexican wares include sherds
from both fine and coarse-paste vessels. The finepaste vessels are from Galera Polychrome (made
after 1750; Fournier (1997] notes that these vessels
have been manufactured since 1780) chocolateras
or bean pots (see Figure 6g-h), as well as wheelmade bowls with a clear lead glaze applied on the
interior and exterior vessel surfaces (see Figure 6ij); one rim from the surface lacks the clear glaze,

however (see Figure 6k). The coarse-paste wheelmade vessels, probably jars or ollas, have either an
interior green glaze (see Figure 61) or a brown glaze
on interior and exterior surfaces (see Figure 6m).
There are 11 sherds of an unglazed hand-made
coarse-paste earthenware, probably from jars or
ollas (see Figure 6n). The sherds are from vessels
that have been incompletely oxidized during open
air firing, and they have crushed rock and bone
temper. Similar coarse-paste earthenwares were
dubbed "Mier Plain" by Alex D. Krieger in his
study of the historic ceramics from Falcon Reservoir, a few miles downstream from San Jose de
Corralitos. Such sherds are particularly abundant in
late 18th century contexts at the Cabasefio site
(41ZP79; see Perttula et al., this volume), recently
exposed by low water levels at Falcon Reservoir,
but have been found in good contexts on Falcon

Reservoir ranch sites occupied at
late as the first quarter of the 20th
century. This distinctive earthenware probably represents ceramics made locally by potters in the
Mexican and Tej ano ranching
communities along the lower Rio
Grande from the late 18th century
to the early 20th century.
Fragmented animal bone comprises 36 percent of the remains
recovered in surface collections
and shovel testing in the Spanish
Colonial component at Corralitos.
The animal bone in Area B is part
of a larger late 18th-mid-19th century bone midden behind Structure 1 (Figure 7). None of the 57
bone fragments from Area B is
identifiable to species, but their
size and thickness indicates that
they are the butchered remains from
large and very large mammals,
probably cattle (Schniebs 1998).

ATTRIBUTES OF
COLONIAL, POSTCOLONIAL, AND
MODERN RANCH
ARCHITECTURE IN
ZAPATA COUNTY

On the middle and lower Rio Grande, historic
ranch buildings remain at many sites associated
with original Spanish land grants. Architectural resources located in Zapata County (e.g., Martinez
1963) are of particular interest since many were
recognized in the 1930s, evaluated in the 1950s,
and were the subject of architectural documentation and publication in the 1970s. Documents associated with these research efforts, such as Historic
American Buildings Survey (HABS) drawings and
photo archives at the University of Texas at Austin's
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL),
provide a unique treatise of modern scholarship on
almost vanished historic sites at the Falcon Reservoir. Also, the 1994 survey and historic designation
of historic sites in conjunction with the Los Caminos
Heritage project (Sanchez 1994) provides broad
contextual data on sites in adjacent counties.

Fleming and Perttula - San Jose de Corralitos, A Spanish Colonial Ranch in Zapata County
While detailed historical records of the ranch
sites in Zapata County are not readily available,
roughly accurate dates are available through prior
documentation efforts. When placed in a chronological context, detailed observation of the buildings' various attributes allow a framework to be
posited for architectural developments.
During the third quarter of the 19th century, the
form and technology of historic ranch buildings in
Zapata County shifted from: (1) a traditional fortified building type, to a (2) non-traditional fortified
building type, to a (3) non-fortified building type.
The complete shift from fortified to non-fortified
buildings occurred after the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo in 1848, the permanent establishment of
troops at Fort Mcintosh in 1849, and perhaps, most
importantly, the demise of the generation who began life as colonists of Nuevo Santander and lived
its entirety fighting against intruders. That this shift
occurred later and more gradually than previously
thought is supported by a survey of various sites in
Zapata County.
Although the initial and terminal dates associated with these architectural changes cannot be
conclusively proven, the senior author contends
that the shift began in the 1850s and was not
complete until at least 1874. This observation is

405

significant as it characterizes Spanish Colonial and
Mexican period ranches exclusively as the traditional fortified dwelling type. In addition, it suggests that a fortified building type, albeit modified,
survived well after the area's incorporation into
the United States. The following framework is
provided to explain the evolution of this architectural resource and the features associated with it.
The architectural trends apply specifically to ranch
houses in Zapata County.

Spanish-Mexican Colonial Ranch
Buildings (1750-1848)

Characteristics

The Spanish-Mexican colonial ranch house is a
simple, masonry structure and notably most, if not
all, of the building's significant architectural features are associated with defense. The exclusive
predominance of fortified ranch architecture through
the mid-19th century attests to the dangers of living
on the colonial frontier.
This architectural form reflects the fact that
perils continually affected the ability of the ranchers to occupy their lands during the first century of
cattle ranching in Zapata County.
Many settlers were killed or captured while protecting their homes
and possessions. The inhabitants
of the frontier were subjected to an
unusually high number and long
duration of threats, including: (1)
the harshness of the natural environment; (2) the retaliation of Native tribes to non-native settlement;
(3) the War for Mexican Independence; (4) a power struggle beâ¢ST4

sites exhibit a similar architectural

vocabulary of fortification. The architectural features,
common also to presidios and mission compounds,
include gunports, very thick sandstone walls, a flat
inflammable concrete roof, heavy doors that could
be barricaded, and a round defensive tower (Fleming
1998:165-169). Additional features typical to colonial period buildings include stone-lined gunports,
wooden canales, a relatively narrow door opening,
and square roof beams.

Relevant sites

Hacienda Dolores probably predated other
regional ranch settlements by more than a decade
and supported an unusually large independent
community, but the struggle to maintain a viable
ranch and keep from death was a concern common
among hacendados and the less wealthy ranchers.
The one-room sandstone building, built after 1767
and probably before 1786, served as the nucleus,
headquarters, and main sanctuary of the community's residents. The 21 x 53 foot building
featured almost 3 foot thick sandstone rubble walls
with mud mortar (1972 Dolores Viejo National
Register of Historic Places nomination form, on
file at the Texas Historical Commission). Hypothetical reconstruction of the ruins suggests as many
as 12 gunports. All extant gunports have a thin
stone lintel and plastered embrasure.
A round tower, 21 feet in diameter, undoubtedly also equipped with gunports, afforded the
watchman an opportunity to sight trespassers along
the riverfront. Testimonials by the founder's grandson indicate that the tower was added in 1814 in
response to repeated attack from Native tribes.
Dolores' ruined tower and walls speaks to its function as a fortress for its inhabitants.
Ramirefio, although smaller in size (33 x 17
feet 9 inches), is similar to the ruins at Dolores. The
single-room building served as a residence for the
Ramirez family on their typical porci6n and was
reportedly constructed between 1781 and 1810
(HABS, TX-3130). The masonry walls, 2 feet 6
inches thick and 15 feet 8 inches high, are comprised of sandstone and mud mortar and terminate
in a parapet with a flat concrete roof.
The minimal fenestration includes two doors
and no windows, but several gunports are located
on each wall and flank the south door. Other details
include 6-inch deep beams of varying width and
mesquite canales.

Building 1 at Corralitos also corresponds to the
major attributes of the foregoing sites. The walls
are 2 feet 10 inches thick and are 13 feet 6 inches
high. The building closely corresponds to the overall building dimensions, framing, and gunport placement of Ramirefio.
Although the details or daily events in the lives
of Spanish settlers at these sites are not known, clearly
their concern for protection marked almost every
aspect of their architecture. As the land and people
who were once Spanish became Mexican in 1810,
and then citizens living on the southern boundary
of the United States in 1848, the threats to their
safety mandated an architecture of fortification.
Post-Colonial Ranch Buildings
(1849-1874+)
Characteristics

The continued erection of fortified buildings
well into the 1860s indicates that the U.S. Army's
protection against the continued threat of the Apache
and Comanche was not immediately effective upon
establishment of Fort Mcintosh in 1849. The prevalence of fortified buildings for almost a generation
following the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
when the area became part of the United States,
may also reflect the old settlers' distrust of their
new Anglo-American government.
Several sites illustrate that in the 1850s, ranchers continued to produce new buildings or additions to existing building complexes with
remarkable similarity to the early fortified prototypes. The exclusivity of design features associated with defensive purposes is, however,
eventually supplanted by other recognizable regional vernacular architectural features. The decorative and functional features developed during
this transitional period eclipse the fortified character of the vernacular ranch buildings by about
the third quarter of the 19th century.

Relevant sites

The Trevino-Uribe Fort contains both colonial
and post-colonial period construction episodes. The
initial building, dating to 1830 or earlier, contained
one room, several gunports, and a 2 feet 9 inch
wide, single leaf, paneled door on a pivot (Myers
and Heck 1998; HABS, TX-3112). Wooden canales

Fleming and Perttula - San Jose de Corralitos, A Spanish Colonial Ranch in Zapata County
characterize the roof drainage system for this original portion of the building complex.
Rooms and enclosing compound walls 12 feet
high, added by Blas Uribe about 1851, also feature
gunports. The enclosed compound, a unique surviving example, evidences the lingering concern of
its owner for the security of his family and property. Uribe's inclusion of such defensive features
reflects the existence of real threats and his memory
of appropriate architectural responses.
Notably in 1851, Uribe also embellished his
fortified compound with sundials, decorative
interior wood framing, and carved stone canales.
By 1870, thin-walled room additions to this
relatively urban residence each include numerous
doors facing onto the public streets. Roof framing
members of these later rooms are considerably
deeper than they are wide, indicating modern
lumber milling practices.
At Rancho San Francisco, located between San
Ygnacio and Corralitos, two buildings constructed
during this period illustrate the trend toward a less
fortified architecture. The earlier building, dating
between 1854 and 1874, has 10 gunports, no windows and, originally, a nearly flat roof draining to
wood canales. The second building, constructed in
1874, contains only three gunports (1973 San Francisco National Register of Historic Places nomination form, on file at the Texas Historical
Commission). Its design emphasizes architectural
ornaments, such as the carved stone canales and
stone medallion inscribed with its date of construction. They communicate the fact that a building's
defensibility was no longer a primary concern of its
residents, although aspects of the fortified housesuch as flat concrete roofs and the absence of windows-were carried forward.
A third example of a post-colonial period
ranch community is Dolores Nuevo, just south of
Laredo. The site includes one fortified residence
constructed in 1859 by the ranch founder, Cosme
Martfnez. His house contained the classic features
of fortification: a flat roof, at least four gunports,
few doors, and no windows. It confirms that
hostilities affecting ranching warranted that such
private fortresses continued to be built, even in
late 19th century America. Dolores Nuevo
reputedly featured an inscribed center ceiling beam
to verify occupancy of the property, a necessary
practice to support land titles after the Bourland
and Miller report of 1852.

407

Unfortified Ranch Buildings
(Late 19th Century to the Present)

Characteristics
In the last quarter of the 19th century, it appears that defense waned as a primary concern of
the lower Rio Grande area ranchers. Gunports are
absent and windows, although protected, emerge as
a common architectural feature of newly constructed
ranch houses.

Relevant sites
Dolores Nuevo, a ranching community founded
after the area became part of the United States,
supported members of the extended Martinez and
Juarez families (1973 Dolores Nuevo National Register of Historic Places nomination form, on file at
the Texas Historical Commission). Built in 1914 as
a two-room residence about 18 x 24 feet in size, the
"Mama Manuela's house" features sandstone walls
that are 1 foot 7 inches thick (Juarez 1976).
The building contains a fireplace and, on the
north wall, there were two large windows once
protected by metals bars. The gabled roof, covered
in wood shingles, indicates little fear of arson. Two
doors on the south wall were wider than earlier
examples and probably could not be barricaded.
Ranch houses like these freestanding, sturdy masonry buildings with shuttered windows and pitched
roofs become the standard for later residential building types in the Laredo region.

CONCLUSIONS
With the exception of the Dolores Nuevo site,
the buildings described above dating from the
Spanish-Mexican colonial (1750-1848) and postcolonial (1849-1874) periods are examples of the
fortified architectural type. These sites provide a
new understanding of the character of conditions
for the inhabitants of the lower Rio Grande valley
as well as its architecture. If the existence of fortified
buildings is considered as a measure of truth for
Turner's (1920) definition of the frontier, as "the
meeting point between savagery and civilization,"
then the historical changes proposed herein have
several interesting implications.
First, the Spanish Empire's directive to conquer
unpopulated lands was carried out by its subjects'

descendants long after Spain had no right to claim
the land or its occupants as its own. Second, even
after the region was incorporated into the United
States it remained a dangerous settlement frontier
not only to the "norteamericanos," but also to those
who had lived there for as long as a hundred years.
That security was not assured; in fact, that it was so
notably absent as to require a radically protective
built environment, changes the popular view of late
19th century America.
On the Rio Grande, especially in the vicinity
of Laredo and San Ygnacio, the most significant
consideration influencing early ranch architecture
was the functional ability of the building to serve
as a defensible place of refuge. As the safety of
the Hispanic ranchers became somewhat more secure during the third quarter of the 19th century,
other concerns surfaced and became transcendent,
producing a richer and more varied architectural
style. New standards for craftsmanship, privacy,
and, in some cases, an urbanized context, altered
the form and technology of the architecture. After
about 1875, defensive architectural features appear to be completely absent from local ranch
buildings. Contemporary with the de-emphasis of
fortification is the debut of new architectural features. Decorative ornaments appear as a result of
increasingly sophisticated craftsmanship and include stone medallions, rosettes, and sundials; inscribed and shaped roof beams and corbels; and
carved stone canales. This period also marks the
beginning of multi-room residences, thinner walls,
and rectangular rather than square beams. The last
benchmark is attributed to mechanized milling
practices, better transportation, and dwindling local resources.
The delineation between colonial fortified ranch
buildings and post-colonial fortified ranch buildings has not been formally presented prior to this
study (see also Fleming 1998). We contend that the
traditional flat-roofed, fortified ranch house was
constructed in the Zapata County area well past the
mid-19th century. An unpublished manuscript dating to the early 1950s by Joe Cason, an archeologist with the National Park Service, states that such
simple, fortified buildings were only constructed
prior to 1800 (Cason n.d.).
Cason documented over a dozen vernacular
ranch buildings in Zapata County prior to construction of the Falcon Reservoir. He identified and labeled flat-roofed, single-room buildings with thick

walls and gunports as "Type One" buildings and
pitched roof, thinner-walled, multi-room structures
as "Type Two" buildings. Notably, at a site known
as Lopeiio, at least one of the buildings contains
gunports and Cason dates this structure either to
1821 or 1850. However, he states that the "Type
Two" buildings:
present something of a paradox: although
they are much more recent than the type
one structures, neither the local population nor the historians of the area have
much information on them ... consequently, the writer [Cason] was unable to
find examples dating from the early
1800s (Cason n.d.:3).
As Cason hints at the contradictions in his own
observations, the question arises why he chose 1800
as the terminal date for the fortified building type
when his manuscript references incidents of Indian
raiding between 1755-1848 in the Falcon Reservoir
area. Further, he was told personally by area residents that "raiding of a sporadic sort continued
until the early 1860's" (Cason n.d.:3). Thus, Cason
prematurely ascribed the demise of defensive features to 1800 and the reasons are unclear for his
belief that this date was accurate. This article's
review of architectural changes in Zapata County
since the mid-18th century disproves Cason's theory
for the terminal date of the early building type. His
"Type One" description largely fits the TrevifioUribe Fort additions of 1851, the 1859 "casa grande"
at Dolores Nuevo, and both buildings at Rancho
San Francisco dating between 1852-1874.
Unfortunately, the extensive physical history
of many early Zapata County ranches has now been
lost to the Falcon Reservoir tides (see George 1975).
Buildings may no longer be observed in the detail
that Cason had available prior to their inundation.
Cason's mistaken theories may be partially attributed to a lack of archival rather than architectural
information. Interestingly, he does hint that a change
in door placement, wall construction, roof form,
and materials occurred after the 1840s.
Errors in previous analysis of ranch sites
throughout Zapata County indicate the difficulty of
interpreting the early history of historically
significant ranch complexes. For example, the
National Register of Historic Places nomination
form for Rancho San Francisco, developed in the

Fleming and Perttula - San Jose de Corralitos, A Spanish Colonial Ranch in Zapata County
mid- l 970s by the Texas Historical Survey
Committee, states that the early stone building dates
to the 1840s. Emory's boundary survey map of
1853-1854 does not indicate the presence of a
settlement at the site. Research to date for San Jose
de Corralitos similarly lacked analysis of the
available archival, archeological, and architectural
data and unfortunately resulted in a misrepresentation of history. Through this recent multidisciplinary effort, the site is now much better
understood and the extant fortaleza is recognized
as possibly the oldest standing secular building in
the state.

Archeological Investigations at
Spanish Colonial
Villa de San Marcos de Neve
Christopher E. Horrell

INTRODUCTION
Recent archeological reconnaissance at the
Spanish colonial town site of San Marcos de Neve
has obtained information about the settlement of
this small community in New Spain's far northern
province of Texas. As part of a global empire, Spain
pushed for the settlement of towns to protect and
conquer the crown's possessions within the New
World. The town of San Marcos de Neve was no
exception. Spain not only wanted to protect her
imperial interests in the New World but also sought
to recreate the social, political, and economic institutions found in the Iberian Peninsula. This political and economic framework is demonstrated in
Immanuel W allerstein' s world-systems model
(Wallerstein 1972; Shannon 1989), and the establishment of this town on the frontier fits some of
the model's expectations. However, the archeological and historical evidence suggests that the
settlement of San Marcos de Neve, and the behavior of these people who settled on the Texas
frontier, was much different from the rules and
laws prescribed for establishing towns. By examining the settlement of this town it is possible
to understand the material and cultural differences that existed in Spanish Texas at the end of
the colonial period.

River (Figure 1). The new town was situated near
the El Camino Real de Arriba and a military post in
present-day Hays County, Texas (Jones 1979:3;
Benavides 1991 :387). The establishment of this
community came at a time when Spain was suffering from a period of social, economic, and political
difficulties (Clark and Juarez 1986:89; Carlson
1994:4; Kenmotsu et al. 1995:1).
At the beginning of the 18th century, the first
of the Bourbon Monarchs set in motion reforms
that would affect the administration of Spain's colonial possessions in the Americas (Poyo 1996:34). By 1759, these reforms sought to solidify the
Crown's authority in both the Iberian Peninsula
and in New Spain (Poyo 1996:4). By reasserting

HISTORICAL SETTING
The aicheological remains of the town of
San Marcos de Neve can be best understood by
first discussing the broader historical context of
Spanish Texas at the end of the colonial period.
In April 1808, the Spanish colonial community
of San Marcos de Neve was established in the
province of Texas on the banks of the San Marcos

expense of the crown, it was possible to shift the
balance of power in the colonies back to the crown
(Poyo 1996:4). Essentially, the Bourbon rulers had
initiated political and economic changes that increased the export and profit potential of the Iberian Peninsula. However, Spain's increased wealth
was short-lived. In 1788, Charles IV, the last of the
Bourbon Monarchs, ascended the thrown. Bad political decisions and an ineffective Prime Minister,
Miguel Godoy, marred his reign (Clark and Juarez
1986:89; Kenmotsu et al. 1995:1). Additionally,
Spain was consistently at war with other European
powers. Unable to maintain the funding needed to
fight these wars, the colonies suffered the crown's
persistent hardships. Consequently, Spain's position was weakened. By 1808, Charles' forces were
defeated by Napoleon, and a puppet government
was established under the authority of Joseph
Bonaparte. As a result, rebellions ensued and the
colonies gradually drifted from Spanish control
(Clark and Juarez 1986:89; Kenmotsu et al. 1995: 1).
Although a distant province of New Spain's
far northern frontier, Texas felt the pressures that
affected the Spanish Empire. In 1763, the Treaty
of Paris ended the Seven Years War and transferred the province of Louisiana over to Spanish
control. As a result of this newly acquired territory and the Bourbon Reforms, Spain encouraged
foreign settlement within Texas as a means of
promoting economic and political control within
the region (Hatcher 1976:3). However, in 1800
this policy changed when Spanish control of Louisiana ceded back to the French. In 1803 a new
nation, the United States, purchased the Louisiana
territory. It was after this transaction that Spanish
colonial provinces once again felt threatened by a
foreign power (Hatcher 1976:3; Jones 1979:39; de
la Teja 1995:5-7; Cruz 1988:52-54). Problems
were amplified by the loss of the Spanish throne
to Napoleon in 1808. And by 1810, a series of
rebellions broke out in New Spain, lasting until
1821, with the eventual loss of Spain's colonies
(Clark and Juarez 1986:89; Kenmotsu et al.
1995: 1). The province of Texas felt these growing
pressures of revolution and would eventually suffer the consequences.
San Marcos de Neve was part of a plan to
establish civilian settlements within the interior
province of Texas. This plan was implemented for
three reasons. First, Texas was considered excellent ranching country, and the abundant wild live-

stock would provide a stable economy for new
settlement (Jones 1979:53; Jackson 1986:10-12).
The early entradas into Texas, and the subsequent
establishment of missions and presidios brought
cattle into the region. By the mid-18th century,
cattle that had strayed from these herds had produced wild livestock throughout the province. As
a result, the hunting and rounding up of these
animals by vaqueros became routine, and provided
some economic stability for Texas. In 1778, Commandant General Teodoro de Croix approved the
establishment of the Mestena Fonda (Mustang
Fund) as a means of providing added income to
the crown through taxes (Jackson 1986: 155-157).
By establishing a cattle industry in Texas, cattle
markets could operate in San Antonio and in cities
such as Saltillo in northern Mexico (Jackson 1986;
Cutter 1995). As a result, new ranchos and civilian settlements moved northward and were established along the Rio Grande as well as in northern
Mexico. Over time, new settlements would eventually move into the area that is now present-day
South Texas.
Second, new settlements would arrest the
smuggling activities that existed within the province. According to Faulk (1964:97-98), smuggling
was a common practice throughout the history of
Spanish Texas. Spanish law made trade with foreign governments illegal, as well as virtually impossible between the colonial provinces without
excessive royal taxes; the need for permits and
passports further hampered legal trade (Faulk
1964:109; Jackson 1986:481; Jones 1979:60).
These restrictions made goods scarce and extremely expensive, turning goods such as tobacco,
cloth, and horses into contraband. By establishing
settlements on the frontier, government officials
believed they could control the exchange of contraband as well as maintain control over the economic activities within the province (Faulk
1964:40; Hatcher 1976:65).
Third, and more importantly, the settlement
was part of a larger agenda to thwart any attempts
made by Americans or any other foreigners to
enter into the province of Texas. Like previous
attempts to settle Texas, namely the presidios and
mission system, the Spanish reacted only when
their territory was threatened. Primarily, the Spanish crown feared that if the Americans or other
foreigners were allowed to encroach on the province of Texas, they might eventually move to-

Horrell - Archeological Investigations at the Spanish Colonial Villa de San Marcos de Neve
wards New Spain's interior and threaten control
over her silver mines, thus adversely affecting what
economic stability was left for the crown. As a
buffer province, Texas offered the added protection New Spain needed (Hatcher 1976:69; Weddle
1992:100; Faulk 1964:113; Cruz 1988:56; de la
Teja 1995: 15). It is no surprise that after the Louisiana Purchase, Spain implemented a plan for new
towns to be established within the province of
Texas. The last of these towns included the Villa
de San Marcos de Neve.
The settlement of San Marcos de Neve was
doomed from the start. Governor Antonio Cordero
y Bustamante, who had pushed for settlement in
Texas, solicited the help of Don Filipe Roque de la
Portilla. Cordero provided only 75 pesos out of the
Mestena Fonda to help establish the new town on
the banks of the San Marcos River. The rest of the
financial investment was to come from Portilla himself (Benavides 1991; Jones 1979).
The first settlers and livestock left the interior
of Mexico and arrived at the site of the new town in
February 1808. By April, town lots were distributed to the settlers around a central plaza. At this
point only 52 individuals along with 1600 head of
livestock were living in the colony (Benavides 1991;
Jones 1979). By June, a flood swept through the
plaza of the town. It is unclear if official permission
to move the town to higher ground was ever granted
(Hatcher 1976:125-126; Jones 1979:5 ).
In September, Portilla brought additional settlers and livestock to the struggling colony. Arriving in October 1808, Portilla wrote that the crops
had failed and that people were camping in the
woods and subsisting only on the existing cattle
herd (Benavides 1991:391-392; Jones 1979:5). A
census given by Portilla in May 1809 indicates that
the additional 30 settlers brought the total population to 82 individuals. Additionally, Native American depredations to the colony continually
diminished the livestock herds and caused enormous grief to the settlers. At this point the documents indicate that a few homes and buildings
existed at the site. What structures that did exist
appear to have been jacales. By late 1809, the rebellions of Mexico began to slowly drift northward
to Texas. Additional problems with the Native
Americans and the lack of government aid would
force this tiny group of settlers back to Mexico by
1812 (Faulk 1964:127; Hatcher 1976:125-126;
Jones 1979:11).

ARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS
In 1995, the Dei:;artment of Antiquities Protection (now the Archeology Division) at the Texas
Historical Commission, conducted an archaeological reconnaissance in Hays County, Texas. The purpose of this investigation was to locate and survey
the site of San Marcos de Neve. Fieldwork was
conducted by a team led by Dr. Nancy Kenmotsu,
and consisted of pedestrian survey, shovel testing,
and mapping (Kenmotsu et al. 1995). The team was
successful in locating a site (41HY273) that contained Spanish colonial period artifacts, including
Spanish ceramics (Figure 2). Additionally, an aerial
photograph of the site revealed a rectangular-shaped
anomaly approximately 335 feet from the early 20th
century structures on the property. On the basis of
these findings, it was rletermined that this was the
site of San Marcos de Neve (Figure 3; see Kenmotsu
et al. 1995:4-10).
In 1997, a second team of archeologists completed survey and test excavations for a proposed
water and fiber optics line near the site of San

included: (1) collecting information about
the landscape and the different peoples who
occupied the site over time, (2) determining
the size of the colonial settlement, and (3)
gathering additional colonial period material
culture data to learn more about the settlers
that occupied the town and environs. A Total
Data Station (TDS) was employed to map the
various properties and point plot surface artifact locations and elevations. Transects
were laid out at 30 m intervals perpendicular
to a base line at 41HY273, and they were
systematically walked 5 m apart looking for
artifacts. This information from the TDS was
downloaded into a computer database in order to produce maps of the site as well as the
distribution of any Spanish Colonial artifact

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The archeological investigations discussed in
this paper indicate there is a significant amount of
Spanish colonial material at 41HY273. Additionally, one piece of majolica and colonial green glass
were recovered on the property on the other side of
the river. Based on the evidence gathered at the two
sites as well as the material recovered at nearby
41HY281, I expect that Spanish colonial archeological remains may be present throughout the area
around 41HY273. Furthermore, the Spanish colonial town of San Marcos de Neve appears to have
been characterized by a dispersed settlement pattern with people living on elevated areas as well as
areas close to the river. Additionally, people would
have wanted access to areas where they could grow
crops. The property directly across from the recorded site of San Marcos de Neve may have served
that purpose. The area would have provided the
necessary resources for both humans and livestock
to survive within the colony. While a dispersed
settlement pattern may have been problematic with
the frequent Native American depredations that took
place at the town, it would provide enough space
for the ranching activities that would have taken
place there.
Because this community was predicated on
ranching, it may have followed similar settlement
patterns of other ranching communities in Northern
Mexico. Although strict rules for establishing towns
in New Spain were in place since 1573, this ideal
was modified the farther away the new towns were
from the seat of power. At San Marcos de Neve, a
town plaza was established with town lots distributed to the settlers (Benavides 1991 :375; Jones
1979). However, this occurred two months after the
arrival of the settlers to the proposed town site. It is
possible that the settlers took up residence outside
the proposed town plaza in order to secure a living
and manage the existing livestock herds.
In essence, what may have occurred at San
Marcos de Neve were that the town's inhabitants
made settlement choices that differed from the Spanish rules and laws that would have governed them.
This town was indeed influenced by the laws of
settlement created by the Spanish government. But,

instead of merely participating in a larger political
and economic framework where settlement of semiperipheries and peripheral areas were dictated by
Mexico City, this town (like others on the frontier)
was also making its own decisions. As Carol
Crumley (1995: 1-5) explains in her work dealing
with heterarchical and hierarchical systems, communities and institutions that are dominated and
influenced by the larger political and economic institutions of which they are a part, are also participants within this larger political and economic
framework, and exert their own restrictions and
influences upon those larger institutions (Crumley
1995; Levi 1997).
This is seen in the small rancheros in Northern
Mexico. Although marginalized from the larger and
more vibrant economy in Mexico, these rancheros
were themselves involved to some degree with the
market economy. As such, these communities were
also somewhat autonomous and self-sufficient. This
autonomy is apparent in the settlement patterns exhibited in the region. For example, Armando Alonzo
(1998:42-43) indicates that the towns of Mier and
Revilla, both on the Rio Grande, were established
on paper and town lots were distributed to the new
settlers. The settlers, however, preferred to spread

out over the area, distributing themselves around
the town as opposed to living within its boundaries
or on the plaza. As time passed, the people slowly
moved into the town, as they were able to establish
a living on their ranchos raising their livestock
(Alonzo 1998:43).
As the historic documents indicate, a town
plaza was established and town lots distributed at
San Marcos de Neve. However, they do not indicate whether the homes were built on the plaza or
whether they were destroyed by flood. Further, the
documents do not indicate if people ever lived on

the plaza. The archeological evidence to date, along
with the historic documentation, suggests that these
people may have indeed followed settlement patterns like that of the ranchero communities that
were established in northern Mexico.
Finally, the colonial community of San Marcos
de Neve is extremely important in that it allows
archeologists and historians to trace the indelible
cultural mark left on the landscape by the Spanish,
specifically, the development of Tejano culture
within Texas. This town did not last for more than
four years, but yet it provides a starting point from
which archeologists may began to understand the
development of cultures and societies in Texas
(Tijerina 1994). By examining these phenomena,

we ultimately enrich our interpretations and advance
the study of humans in the past.

ABSTRACT
The production and use of historic Native American ceramics in the El Paso, Texas, area are examined
through archeological and ethnohistoric data. While little is known about the ceramic traditions ofN ative peoples
in the region between A.D. 1400-1680, there are abundant data associated with the post-Pueblo Revolt
occupation of the El Paso area by northern and middle Rio Grande immigrants. Native brownware and red-onbrownware traditions for local ceramic use incorporated European forms and design motifs. Nonetheless, the
brownware tradition appears to have been a strong marker of Native American identity in an increasingly
colonial world.

INTRODUCTION
The investigation of Native American ceramic
production is one of the most important aspects of
the study of prehistoric traditions in the Southwestern U.S. Finely defined chronologies and the
social relevance in the evolution, production, and
dispersion of various ceramic styles within the
Southwest have yielded some of the best archeological examples of our ability to understand past
ceramic traditions beyond the most simplistic assessments of social contact and population movement. The Southwest has also seen some of the
most intensive studies of historic Native American ceramic traditions.
The El Paso area has often been overlooked as
a participant in this important regional ceramic tradition-despite a long historical tradition of indigenous ceramics-probably because of the relatively
poor artistic quality of the specimens relative to the
finer traditions to the north and south. While perhaps not a part of the mainstream of Southwestern
cultural development, studies of the indigenous El
Paso Brownware tradition constitute an important
key to the larger picture of prehistoric adaptation
and human ecology in the region. Likewise, historic Native American ceramics from the El Paso
area provide a unique opportunity to understand
cultural processes because of the acculturation of

Native American groups under Spanish Colonial
political control.
The Rio Grande Valley of El Paso, Texas, lies
in the shadow of Spanish colonial era history in the
American Southwest (Figure 1). The attention given
to the modern towns of Santa Fe, Taos, and
Chimay6, and the charm of the northern New Mexican mountainscape obscures the role of Paso del
Norte in the settlement of northern New Spain. The
Pass was critical to the success of the frontier settlements, in its role as a site of early exploration, and
as a node along the Camino Real from Santa Barbara, Chihuahua and Santa Fe, New Mexico. The
Paso del Norte also was the refuge for Spanish
colonists and their First Nations allies during the 12
years of exile following the Pueblo Revolt of 1680.
Even following the resettlement of the northern Rfo
Grande valley in the 1690s, Paso del Norte and the
lower valley of El Paso were among the most productive agricultural landscapes in the region, thus
drawing both indigenous peoples and Europeans
alike (Hendricks 1994a, 1994b ). The Mission
wines and brandies of the area were the pride of
the frontier, and the perennial gardens of the lower
valley of El Paso were balm to travelers fresh
from the desert.
Throughout its history, this region has been an
amalgam of different peoples, from the indigenous
Manso and Suma and naciones from surrounding

regions (including the Janos, Jumanos, and
Jocomes); the northern Puebloans who were swept
south following the Pueblo Revolt in the 1680s;
raiding Apache who settled peaceably in the last
years of empire under the Apaches de Paz settlement program; the caste Spanish colonists who
ranged in ethnicity from Hispanics to mestizos; and
finally the Anglo-Europeans who came in force
beginning in the 1830s, but most critically immigrated in the 1880s with the railroad and in the
191 Os with the advent of industrial irrigation cotton
agriculture. This sweep of history was a polyglot of
ethnic groups, languages, and cultures, ranging from

a variety of indigenous traditions to that of the
Spanish colonists who were establishing hegemony
throughout the region (Peterson and Brown 1994).
The diversity and variety of local ethnic groups
continued into the late 19th century. Adolf
Bandelier was drawn to explore the archival
records and the diverse communities of the area in
his sojourn in Paso del Norte in the 1880s (Lange
and Riley 1970). Because of his diligence and
detailed diaries and watercolors of indigenous pottery from the region, we have excellent accounts
and representations to compare with the archeological record of the region.
This paper examines the production and use
of historic Native American ceramics in the El
Paso area, comparing available archeological data
with limited 19th and 20th century ethnographic
data relevant to ceramic production. Although the
main producers of the pottery of this tradition
were probably peoples moved from the middle
Rio Grande during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680,
from its earliest days these ceramics seem to be
very different from the former traditions of these
transplanted pueblos. Like the harried Native
American populations of this region, the local historic ceramic tradition represents a mixing of regional populations and also reflects the variation
in raw materials available to local potters. Although the local brownware tradition seems to
have been produced by and for the local Native
American mission populations, from its beginnings
this transplanted tradition incorporated European
forms and design motifs. Despite the recent origins of the tradition and in spite of the strong
influence of European traditions, the style survived,
albeit continually evolving, into the 20th century.
As such, it reflects the survival of the region's
Native American community.

NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY
IN THE EL PASO AREA
Native peoples have roamed the Jornada region since the end of the Pleistocene. Although the
earliest history is still less well known than in some
adjacent regions, considerable knowledge has been
acquired over the last few years (Miller 1989).
Ceramic production has a long history in the El
Paso area. Ceramics with plain brown-colored
pastes and occasional red-slipped sherds have been

Brown, Peterson, and Hill - Discourse in Clay: Ceramics and Culture in Historic Soccorro
associated with radiocarbon dates from the first
two centuries of the common era (LeBlanc 1982).
The ceramic types El Paso Brown, El Paso
Bichrome, and El Paso Polychrome are widely distributed throughout southern New Mexico, West
Texas, and northeastern Chihuahua and are associated with pueblo groups. Based on extensive petrographic studies, the ceramics representing the El
Paso types contained granites of variable composition. Granite is available in the nearby Franklin
Mountains (Hill 1991). Red clay and granite boulders are available near prehistoric residential zones
on the alluvial fans of the Franklins.
Introduced ceramics represent material evidence of social contact. Mimbres Black-on-white
produced in southwestern New Mexico is commonly recovered from prehistoric sites in the Paso
del Norte area in contexts dating prior to A.D. 1150.
Occasional Pueblo pottery from the north and west
have also found their way into the region. Ceramics
representing the Casas Grandes ceramic tradition
have been reported from sites dating between A.D.
1000-1450.
There is a distinct break in the aboriginal adaptation and material cultural traditions of the Paso
del Norte region. It would appear that most of the
pueblo occupations may have disappeared by A.D.
1450. The year 1450 was one of the worst droughts
that can be documented in the past. In any case,
there is little in the way of continuity between the
prehistoric and historic brownware traditions in the
El Paso area.

THE EARLIEST HISTORIC
BROWNWARES
Spanish explorers traveling through the Paso
del Norte, beginning with Francisco de Coronado
in 1541, reported indigenous peoples, namely the
Manso and Suma (Peterson 1991). While little
was reported on the production and use of ceramics by these groups, the excavation of sites dating
to the late 17th century has produced evidence in
the form of pottery made using clay and temper
resources that were located in the Rio Grande
trench (Hall 1994).
Excavations at historic sites in the El Paso area
have obtained extensive collections of Native-produced ceramics. These ceramics are characterized
by brown to tan bodies that are either plain or

423

decorated using red pigment. The paste of these
ceramics is somewhat variable, reflecting the use
of clay deposits and sediments located along the
Rio Grande (Hill 1991, 1997; Hill and Peterson
1998b).
While the historic brownware tradition of the
El Paso area is generally regarded as having been
introduced by Pueblo potters from the middle Rio
Grande/Rio Abajo area, there is reason to suspect
that local influences, in the form of Manso, Suma,
or even Apache potters, may have been present as
well. In fact, the Late Prehistoric pottery of the Rio
Abajo region is quite different from that of the El
Paso historic brownwares, and known types from
the middle and upper Rio Grande are rare to nonexistent on early historic sites in the El Paso area. A
sample of brownware ceramics from LA67321 has
a light brown silty paste with rounded quartz sand
inclusions, strongly resembling those of the El Paso
area of the same age (Hill 1997). The similarities in
the ceramics from LA67321 to many of those from
contemporary sites in the Paso del Norte reflects
the use of clays derived from terraces of the Rio
Grande at both locations.
Gerald (1968:54) was one of the first to mention the local historic brownwares, in his discussion of the Spanish presidios of New Spain, when
he wrote that:
One or more of the locally made
brownwares, red-on-browns, redwares,
and white wares were found on every
presidio site. These are presumably the
common utility wares which were made
by local specialists or by each presidia!
wife. The paste of most of this local pottery is fairly coarse texture though a finer
paste was utilized at some sites.
Graves (1982) provides a brief description of
the locally produced brownwares from the Old
Socorro Mission (41EP1532). From a sample of
748 sherds excavated from the site, he described
two types based on simple technological attributes. One was a dark brown color with a
coarse paste while the other, a lighter brown
color, had a finer paste. He suggested the differences were the result of the proportions of clay
and sand temper and suggested that the variation
may have little cultural significance (Graves
1982:5-6).

424

Texas Archeological Society

The first thorough description of the historic
brownwares from El Paso was undertaken by Tice
(1987), who studied 218 rim sherds and five partial
vessels from the Old Socorro Mission. Tice defined
two basic types, Socorro Brown, and Socorro Brown
Smudged, and identified several other miscellaneous
historic brownwares.
According to Tice, the paste of the Socorro
Brown ceramics is quite variable, being either coarse
or fine textured, with a core color that ranged from
black to yellowish-red depending upon the firing
temperature and the degree of oxidation of the paste
(Tice 1987: 19-20). Refiring sherds with gray and
black pastes to ca. 600Â° C yielded a brown paste
color in the 7.5YR range. Tempering material was
also found to be variable, with 77 percent of the
sherds exhibiting sand temper, 3 percent crushed
rock, and 20 percent a combination of both (Tice
1987:20). Tice noted that the sand evidenced procurement from both alluvial and eolian environments, while he described the highly variable
crushed rock as "exotic." Vessel surfaces were
smoothed or "wiped" but not generally highly polished or burnished. Tice described the vessel forms
as primarily small bowls, large bowls, narrow mouth
jars, wide mouth jars, and plates.
Tice (1987:33) distinguished Socorro
Smudged from Socorro Brown by its characteristic intentionally smudged interior. These smudged
sherds accounted for less than 9 percent of the
brownware sherds from the mission site. Technological attributes were essentially the same between the two types, although he noted no sherds
with only crushed rock temper, and there appeared
to be a greater degree of smoothing or polishing
on the smudged sherds.
Sale et al. ( 1987) recovered 736 brownware
sherds from a trench monitoring project in the community of Ysleta. Their analysis of the 728 undecorated brownware sherds indicated that all were
sand-tempered (Sale et al. 1987:31). High percentages of fine- to medium-grained sub-angular and
rounded particles suggested an origin in drainage
bottoms or arroyo fans but not in the river floodplain where sand grain sizes tend to be larger.
Vessel surfaces were typically well smoothed and
about 40 percent were smudged; the great majority were smudged only on the interior, but with a
substantial number on both surfaces, and a few on
the exterior surface only (Sale et al. 1987:32).
Vessel forms included bowls (the most common

single form comprising two-thirds of the sample),
plates, jars, and ollas.
The most extensive discussion of historic
brownwares to date has been by Miller and
O'Leary (1992) from the Ysleta Clinic Site
(41EP2840). Their sample included 19,048 historic brownware sherds, which they call Ysleta
Brownwares (in deference to possible ethnic or
cultural differences between the Ysleta Tigua potters and the Socorro Piro potters who may have
made Socorro Brown as defined by Tice [1987]).
On a general level, they note four primary characteristics of the assemblage:
1. A limited range of vessel forms and rim styles,
indicating little temporal and/or functional
variability;
2. A diverse range of firing conditions and other
production aspects, indicating unstandardized
production techniques;
3. Close similarities in vessel forms and styles to
Spanish-influenced wares from Tiwa and
Tewa communities of the middle and upper
Rio Grande valley of New Mexico; and
4. Evidence that some of the Ysleta brownwai;es
were not produced locally (Miller and O'Leary
1992:143).
Miller and O'Leary's analysis of Ysleta
brownware ceramics focused on a sample of 1069
rim sherds after it was determined that body sherds
were unreliable in determining vessel form. Excluding those rims which were too small or too
damaged to analyze left a sample of 628 rim sherds.
Three general vessel forms were identified within
this sample: jars, bowls, and plates. Jars (51 percent) were slightly more common than bowls (44
percent). The third form, plates, was restricted to
only 5 percent of the sample.
Analysis of the rim forms linked to the three
vessel types indicated little variation among the
ollas or jars, with only a single basic form featuring
a highly everted rim above a small globular, but not
bulging, body (Miller and O'Leary 1992:148). Two
plate variations were noted: one was a flat plate
with a thickened rim and the other, somewhat rare
in the sample, had a flat rim above a sunken midsection, characteristic of "soup plates." The bowl
rims, on the other hand, were more variable, with
five basic types, including: (1) large to moderate-

Brown, Peterson, and Hill - Discourse in Clay: Ceramics and Culture in Historic Soccorro
sized hemispherical bowls with direct or slightly
outcurved rims, (2) direct rim bowls with carinated
inflection points identical to Tewa polychrome bowl
forms, (3) large to moderate-sized bowls with
incurved rims, (4) small bowls with flared rims,
and (5) small cups (Miller and O'Leary 1992:148).
Of these types, the combined direct and carinated bowl types formed the greater part of the
collection, with 72 percent overall, while the
incurved types were found in about 22 percent of
the sample. The flared variety accounted for only 5
percent of the rims. The least common was the
small cup, with only one example.
Miller and O'Leary (1992:154) note two kinds
of temper: fine to medium-grained sands and angular crushed rock. Ollas or jars were tempered almost exclusively with crushed rock, while bowls
had both tempers. Surface finishing was found to
be generally simple, with most ollas simply wiped
while bowls and plates were more carefully finished. Overall, 22 percent of the jar interiors were
intentionally smudged, as compared to less than 9
percent noted by Tice (1987) at the Old Socorro
Mission site. A small percentage of the collection
had a thin, easily eroded white slip.

LATER HISTORIC
BROWNWARES
The most important type of ceramics in terms of
understanding the interaction of indigenous peoples
with those of European descent are the historic
brownwares. These ceramics form the largest component of the historic ceramic samples in the lower
Valley (see Graves 1982; Tice 1987; Sale et al. 1987;
Miller and O'Leary 1992; Peterson and Brown 1994;
Marshall 1996; Leach et al. 1996). Where there are
differences among these samples, the ceramics we
discuss from the Phase II Socorro project (Peterson
and Brown 1994) appear to match most closely
those described by Tice from the Old Socorro Mission. The decorated examples include probable examples of what Miller and O'Leary (1992) have
called Tigua Red on Brown (in this case, perhaps
Socorro Red on Brown would be more appropriate
for the Piro area), but also examples of what may
be Tardio period ceramics from Mexico.
In general, the broad statements made by Miller
and O'Leary (1992:143) are applicable. As they

425

note, there is a limited range of vessel and rim
forms. Although the actual number of rim forms
in the Phase II Socorro sample may be slightly
greater than that in the Y sleta sample, the number
of vessel forms is similarly limited. With a few
exceptions, bowls, plates, and jars are essentially
the only forms; jars may be less common than in
the Ysleta sample. Various bowl forms appear to
be the dominant type. Miller and O'Leary (1992)
also note the diverse range of firing conditions and
production traits. Although not readily quantifiable, the Phase II Socorro sample is extremely
diverse in this regard and is probably similar to
that recovered from Y sleta. With respect to the
observation that the forms are closely related to
those common in the early historic period of the
middle and upper Rio Grande communities, there
is little supporting evidence. Ethnic differences
may account for the lack of similarity, as would
temporal changes, because the Socorro sample is
as much as a century later in many cases.
A number of special brownware forms were
recovered during the investigations. The most
unique of these is a fragmentary brownware
candleholder from 41EP3606. This specimen has
the approximate form of a flattened circular glass
paperweight with a narrow central section that has
been broken off and an apparent handle extending
from one side of the base (also broken). It is not
like the examples described by Tice (1987) from
the Old Socorro Mission.
Another unusual functional class of brown ware
ceramics is the comal, or tortilla griddle (Figure 2).
Comal sherds are either perfectly flat or have low
walls that extend upward at 90Â° from the base.
Based on large sherds recovered from excavations
conducted near Ysleta, both round and rectangular
comales were produced (Leach et al. 1996).
Comales represent a cooking technology that was
apparently imported from Mexico during the historic period as no unequivocal comales are known
from prehistoric sites in New Mexico.
In addition to the candleholder, a single large,
heavy spindle whorl was recovered from 41EP3011.
A number of ceramic disks, some of them possibly
ceramic tools, game counters, or spindle whorl
blanks, were recovered from various sites. Several
crudely shaped sub-circular worked sherds were
also recovered, along with several varieties of vessel handles.

Staski 1990). The presence of two
sherds of red-on-brown pottery in the
lowest levels at the Ronquillo House
in San Elizario suggests an early 19th
century or earlier date for this style
of pottery (Hill 1998).
However, red decorated sand-tempered ceramics are present in the ceramic assemblage from San Antonio
de Padua (A.D. 1660-1684) at Casas
Grandes, Chihuahua (Di Peso et al.
1974). Capote Red-on-brown (A.D.
1600-1700) and Conchos Red-onbrown (A.D. 1700-1800) are present
in ceramic assemblages from the La
Junta area of West Texas (Cloud et
al. 1994). Problems with sample size
and the lack of comparative studies
among these red-on-brown variants
suggest the need for further research,
especially as the overlap in territory
as ascribed to Puebloan period (Figure 5) and protohistoric period settlement is so striking (Figure 6).
Overall, the brownware ceramic
sample from the El Paso area is
extremely interesting and has great
potential for further analysis. Most

Red-on-Brown Native-made Ceramics
This class of ceramics was Native-produced
using a red iron-based paint for decoration. Designs appear to reflect a merging of Native and
European decorative traditions (Figures 3 and 4).
These decorated types bear some resemblance to
the decorated pottery described by Tice ( 1987) as
19th century or post-Mission Red-on-Brown.
There is evidence that red-on-brown ceramics
were not produced until the late 18th or early 19th
centuries in the El Paso area (Leach et al. 1996).
Unfortunately the only contexts where red-on-brown
ceramics have been recovered from independently
dated contexts are at military posts and a Butterfield
Stage stop in Dofia Ana County, New Mexico, all
of which date to the mid-19th century (Hill 1986;

red slip applied to a paste that is quite different
from the typical locally produced brownwares. It
may be akin to several varieties of redware (and/
or polychromes) described in Miller and O'Leary
(1992). They note that some of the red-painted
sherds may be from Ogapoge or Tewa Polychrome
bowls. Red-slipped vessels were also a part of
the ceramic industry of several northern New
Mexico Pueblos, following the exploitation of
lead sources for the production of bullets by the
Spanish. Alternatively, redwares could be forms
of local "Piro" finishes documented by Bandelier
in his watercolor sketches of vessels found in the
area in the 1880s.

intriguing are the differences between sites,
especially those between the
Socorro sample and that recorded
for Y sleta. Further research in
this area may determine if indeed
the differences are due to site age,
site function, or ethnic affiliations. In general, however, it is
thought that all of the above play
an important role in their different characteristics.

(Mera 1933). This vessel is a bowl with a strongly
everted rim that is thinned toward the lip. Traces
of eroded black glaze paint are found on the
exterior surface below the rim. The paste of this
vessel is different that those of the locally
produced brownwares. At least one other body
sherd from that site may also be a Glazeware
example. Additional Glaze F ceramics have been
reported from the Y sleta Clinic sites and from
the surface of the Keystone Dam site (Miller and
O'Leary 1992).
The presence of Tewa and Ogapoge Polychrome and Rio Grande Glaze F style ceramics
in historic assemblages in the El Paso area indicates occupation during the late 17th and early
18th centuries. These occupations are also well
documented in the contemporary literature. The
presence of ceramics produced in northern New
Mexico also is evidence for the movements of
goods and peoples along the Camino Real, the
route linking northern Nuevo Mexico with
Nueva Vizcaya, modern Chihuahua.

EUROPEAN/MEXICAN
CERAMICS
Majolica
Numerous tin-enameled
ceramics were recovered from
the sites in the Socorro area.
Most of the sherds are quite
small and many are plain, precluding definite identification.
As a group, they are the earliest European-influenced ceramics to occur in the
assemblages and, while they
are found at most of the sites,
and throughout the excavations levels, from top to bottom in the units, they
dominate the lower, earlier
levels in the archeological deposits. While most, even the
decorated wares, are not temporally diagnostic, those that
are appear to be quite late,
spanning the period from the
mid-18th to the mid-19th
centuries.

Puebla Blue on White
This is one of the most easily recognized of the
extant types, and perhaps the most widely distributed majolica, although it is less common in the
Socorro area than the later San Elizario Polychrome.
Manufactured in Puebla, Mexico, as early as the
late 17th or early 18th century, this type is recognized by a blue floral pattern marked occasionally
by raised designs (Goggin 1968; Deagan 1987).
There is considerable variability in the few specimens identified from the Socorro project area, including differences in paste color, glaze color,
decoration color, thickness, and care in execution.
Most of the fragments are small, however, and tend
to be rims rather than body or base sherds. Although a few bowls are present, the sample appears
to be dominated by plate forms. This is probably
the earliest type found in the El Paso area, although
both Goggin (1968) and Deagan (1987) note that it
persists well into the 19th century.

Brown, Peterson, and Hill - Discourse in Clay: Ceramics and Culture in Historic Soccorro
San Elizario Polychrome
This type was originally defined by Gerald
(1968) for the northern New Spain presidios and it
is indeed common in the Socorro and San Elizario
areas. San Elizario Polychrome in our samples is
characterized by the use of dark blue designs, usually in a band encircling the rim, that were framed
in narrow brownish-black to black lines. Blue elements, typically individual wide brush strokes, are
pendant from this band. Each of the brush strokes
often has a single brownish-black line within the
stroke. Many of the securely typed specimens from
the El Paso area belong to this type and a number of
other questionable specimens may be examples of
this type.
Aranama Polychrome
This type was initially defined by Goggin
(1968). Aranama Polychrome sherds had yellow
bands, framed by narrow brownish-black lines similar to those observed in San Elizario Polychrome
(Barnes 1980). Green abstract floral elements were
also present, pendant from the band. Brownishblack lines are also present within isolated yellow
elements. Aranama Polychrome represents the latest end of a highly variable decorative continuum
in majolica that began with the 17th century type,
Abo Polychrome. Aranama Polychrome is thought
to have been produced sometime between 1700 and
1830 (Lister and Lister 1976). It is represented by a
single sherd from site 41EP3625, one possible example from 41EP3010, and in sherds from the San
Elizario Plaza excavations (Hill 1998).

Unidentified Green on White
A relatively large number of green on white or
green and black on white or cream polychromes are
found in the El Paso area, particularly at 41EP3625
and 41EP3010.

Miscellaneous Orange Line
Polychrome
Several sherds of this type were found at various proveniences in the Socorro and San Elizario
areas. It may be a variant of Aranama Polychrome,
although this is unclear; it does appear, however, to

429

date later in time than earlier at San Elizario and
Socorro. These sherds probably relate to a series of
types defined by Gerald (1968) and Barnes and
May (1972).

Miscellaneous 19th Century
Polychromes
In the upper levels of most of the sites are a
bewildering variety of multi-colored majolicas that
have relatively sloppy designs, lack traditional majolica design elements (such as the well-defined
rim band or central figure), and are without blue
coloration. Deagan (1987) has pointed out that
such late sherds seem to copy design elements
from 19th century imported English ceramics such
as transfer wares.
Two late majolica sherds recovered from San
Elizario represent examples of Guanajuato Blueon-white. These ceramics were characterized by a
thick white slip with dark blue designs on a yellowish-red paste. Given the stratigraphic association of
these sherds, it is likely that they belong with the
19th century occupation of San Elizario.

LEAD-GLAZED WARES
One of the most common, and indeed most
interesting, non-brownware ceramic types recovered from the El Paso area is Mexican lead-glazed
ware (Figure 7). This ware reflects a blending of
European and indigenous ceramic traditions. These
wares have been described in some detail by Barnes
(1980); Deagan (1987) has also presented data regarding their manufacture and distribution. More
recently, Carlson et al. (1994; see also Carlson and
Malicse, this volume) have investigated their chemical composition with the goal of understanding their
origins and distribution. For the most part, the leadglazed ceramic bodies are soft-paste earthenwares
not unlike the brownwares found in the Lower Valley (Hill 1998).
Brown paste Mexican glazeware is characterized by a clear lead glaze on a reddish-yellow to
reddish-brown, or less commonly yellow, paste.

and green. The beginning date of this class of
ceramics is unknown. Clear lead-glazed ceramics

long and poorly defined span of production that ranges from the 17th into the
19th century (Brown et al. 1998; Hill
1998).

Green Lead-Glazed
Olive Jars
These thick sherds have a thin, almost transparent, green glaze on the interior surface and no exterior glaze. This
form was originally studied by Goggin
(1968), who defined Early, Middle, and
Late Styles, although more recent analysis of larger collections has discounted
his developmental sequence. Four Olive
jar sherds were recovered from 41EP3625

continue to be produced today over much of
Mexico.
Green-glazed ceramics were categorized based
on the color of the paste. Green-glazed sherds
with an orange to brown paste were classified as
Guanajuato Green-Glaze ware. Guanajuato Greenglazed sherds had similar colored pastes to those
observed in the brown paste Mexican glazeware
tradition and the Guanajuato Blue-on-white majolica. Most commonly the pastes were reddishyellow or occasionally dark brown in color. It has
been suggested that Guanajuato Green-Glaze ware
was produced between 1750 and 1850 (Barnes
1980). However, Guanajuato Green-glazed ceramics were recovered in later contexts in the San
Elizario and Socorro areas, and are produced in
Guanajuato today (Fournier 1997).
Green-glazed ceramics with a white, gray, or
pinkish paste were identified as Presidios Green.
Presidios Green had a pinkish-gray, pink, or occasionally brown paste. While the majority of the
sherds had a dark green glaze, one sherd had a
grayish-green glaze. Presidios Green was defined
based on collections from Carrizal, Chihuahua
(Brown et al. 1998). Presidio de San Fernando de
Carrizal was occupied between 1774 and 1847.
However, occupation of the site area continues
into the present (Gerald 1968; Ben Brown, 1996
personal communication). Presidios Green has a

WHITE EARTHENWARES
The largest category of European-produced and
influenced ceramics is white earthenwares or
whitewares. Overall, 148 white earthenware sherds
were collected from the investigations in the Socorro
and San Elizario areas. These sherds vary from a
relatively soft paste ivory-colored variety that may
be a creamware to hard, chalky white, high gloss
clear glaze ironstones. A few sherds with a slight
bluish tint may be pearlware, although the tentative
identification is based on very small fragments.
White earthenwares dominate the assemblage
from several of the Socorro and San Elizario sites,
and are found in the upper levels of excavation
units at most of them. Majolica was clearly the
dominant European type throughout the 17th and
18th centuries in the El Paso area, with a small
amount of porcelain; in contrast, whitewares became the dominant type of the 19th century. It is
not known how early these wares were introduced
into the area but English ceramics are likely to
have become more common after the El Paso area
came under United States rule at the end of the
Mexican War. Several of the decorated types, such
as shell-edge and hand-painted floral wares, probably date to this early period. Some of the transfer-printed wares may also date to the mid-19th
century. In general, decorated types are relatively

Brown, Peterson, and Hill - Discourse in Clay: Ceramics and Culture in Historic Soccorro

uncommon, however, and plain whitewares are
dominant; the decorated types found date to the
earlier portion of the 19th century. Late 19th century decorated types such as decalcomania are rare
in the ceramic assemblages.

PORCELAIN
Chinese porcelains quickly replaced Spanish
majolicas as a luxury item in Mexico, perhaps after
the extensive production and distribution of Mexican majolicas from Mexico City and Puebla. The
amount of porcelain recovered from El Paso area
investigations is small, and much of it is not from
unequivocally early contexts. With the development of porcelain technology in Europe during the
18th century, without chemical analysis it is difficult to discriminate Chinese from European porcelain. Most of the porcelain is probably 19th century
in age, and much of it may be from Europe rather
than China (Hill and Peterson 1998a).

STONEWARE
Utilitarian stoneware vessels are found
throughout the upper levels of the excavation units
at several Socorro sites, although they comprise
only a small percentage of the total ceramic
sample. The stonewares observed include those
typical of mass-produced, widely distributed vessels probably introduced into the area in significant numbers only after the railroad was built to
the El Paso area in the late 19th century. These
include primarily Albany glazes, with large cylindrical forms such as chums, and a few stoneware
mixing bowls. Notably absent are stoneware ginger beer or ale bottles, generally ubiquitous in
ceramic assemblages from mid- and late 19th century historic sites in other parts of Texas.

BANDELIER AND THE SEARCH
FOR ETHNIC SURVIVAL
AT PASO DEL NORTE
When Bandelier visited the Paso del Norte area
in 1883, Piros, Tiguas, Apaches, and Manso peoples
were still living in the area. The Mansos, who were
the least documented of the groups, had a clan
system similar to the Tiguas with four different

431

clans, and they still had claim to a communal tract
of land. They danced at the feasts in Paso del Norte,
kept grapes from which they made wine, and made
pottery (Lange et al. 1984:249).
Bandelier was among the first historians to
study the archives of the Juarez Municipio. These
records had been used as campfire tinder by
Kearney's troops in the Mexican-American conflicts of 1846, but what had survived provided some
documentation of local indigenous groups as well
as the colonial history of the area, sporadically
settled since the late 16th century.
The Mission of Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe
was established in 1659 by Fray Garcia San Francisco y Zuniga. A mission and an acequia were
constructed within the first few years, and the
Mansos and Suma apparently lived with some Piro,
Tigua, and Tompiro even before the Pueblo Revolt
of 1680. After that time, the northern Puebloans
intermarried and lived in close contact with Mansos
and Sumas as well as other groups probably
Taracahitan in their language affiliation. In 1684,
the Mansos rebelled against the Spanish, and several years of strife ensued, where Janos, Suma,
Mansos, and other Indian groups destroyed the missions and returned to the hinterland. Even after
1686, when the Mansos returned to the missions,
the missionaries frequently complained that they
were hard to corral in Paso del Norte and they often
left for the country. From 1693 to 1709, smallpox
epidemics affected the population, and uprisings of
Mansos, Sumas, Janos, Jocome, and Apache occasionally disturbed the Spanish settlements. According to Bandelier, the Mansos he encountered in
19th century Paso del Norte attributed their dwindling population to this period.
Bandelier commented that he had heard from
Cura Ramon Ortiz of the Mission of Our Lady of
Guadalupe that the Mansos had originally been in
that place, but that they had become so mixed with
the Puebloans from the northern Pueblos that they
had "given up their nationality and language." Ortiz
told him that the Zumas (Sumas) had almost completely died out during the smallpox epidemic of
1780, except for a Camargo "who himself died 14
years ago, leaving only one son" (Lange and Riley
1970:162).
On November 6, 1883, Bandelier noted:
I walked over and found Nicomedes
Lara or [y?]Leyva. He is alone in his

432

house, his people left him; his
wife is dead. Very soon became acquainted. He is Manso!
They have now forgotten their
language completely and speak
only Spanish. But he says that
they know they came from the
north and they are Piros. He
even says that some of his
people [speaking of the Leyva)
are at Zuni! Of course he began
with the fib of Montezuma, but
when I told him that I was
adopted at Cochiti, he changed
tune and interrogated me as to
"que era la primera cosa en un
Pueblo?" (Lange and Riley
1970:160-161).

Bandelier went on to describe
the religious festivals and clans related to him by Nicomedes Lara,
and the pottery which "looks very
much like that of the Pimas. It has
the same paint and color. Only it
is a little lighter in here, but the
designs are remarkably similar"
(Lange and Riley 1970:161). After another visit, he remarked:

Bandelier's material are the diversity of thickened rims and plates
and jars with Spanish forms. Perhaps Bandelier was searching for
origins so diligently that he overlooked the forms with carinated
shoulders and newly colonial era
functions such as comales and tortilla irons that appear in Houser' s
collection from Natividad
Camargo (Figure 12). In any case,
they are clearly distinct from the
polychrome vessel and the plain

by still separate ethnic groups in

indigenous styles of pottery were

and with Spanish traditions,
Bandelier' s images provide a
baseline for evaluating the merging of style, technique, and ceramic form. Similarly, Rouser's
photographs depicting vessels and
tools said to have been kept since
the late 19th century by the
Camargo family clearly document
the persistence of Native traditions
in the face of Spanish colonial hegemony in the region. The culture
of ceramic production recorded by
Hedrick indicates that while few
ceramics were produced in the El

the 20th century, the memory of
the craft was still alive in a few
residents of the area.

Peterson 1998a, 1998b). Miller and
O'Leary (1992) see the origin of
the brownwares in the Spanish-influenced ceramics of the middle
and upper Rio Grande areas. While
there are some similarities and
some direct links, such as the Rio
Grande Glazeware, between these
areas and the Paso del Norte, there
are fewer than expected. Did the
transition in ceramic production
require investigation of new clay
and temper sources and did the discovery of these initiate new technological directions? Or did the
Spanish in the Paso del Norte area
exert a different and perhaps
greater influence on the transplanted cultures? Is it possible that
there was an admixture of Native
brownware traditions from the
Sumas or Manso (or even Apache)
that may have guided the acculturation of Piro potters to their
new home? Given the evidence
for intermarriage between Native
peoples, any ethnic epitaphs assigned to brownware assemblages from different localities in
the Paso del Norte are likely to
be misleading.
There are also questions regarding the extent and distribution

many potters were there and to
what degree are individual differences or even micro-regional differences reflected in the simple technologies and
even simpler decorative stylistic elements found?
What was the range of wares produced? This historic pottery's paste, however, is quite different
from the prehistoric brownwares and the genetic
relationship between the two wares is not immediately apparent.
A key aspect of the examination of the
brownware tradition is the mode and locus of production. Gerald (1968) notes that brownware production may have been the purview of every

brownwares in the Paso del Norte. Despite the

436

Texas Archeological Society

differences between the historic brownwares and the
local prehistoric ceramic tradition, there is evidence
that these historic brownwares are part of a very
strong and long-lasting local pottery tradition that
produced the vast majority of utilitarian ceramics for
more than a century. Only with the opening of wider
trade at the end of the 18th century and the subsequent end of the colonial era did production of local
brown wares decline. Indeed, Jesse Walter Fewkes,
an archeologist and ethnographer for the Smithsonian
Institution, who traveled through the Pass at the beginning of the 20th century, found that no more
vessels were being produced by Native peoples living in the Paso del Norte (Fewkes 1902). Despite
this decline, they continued as a viable element in
the total ceramic assemblage into the 20th century.
Through time, the brownware ceramic tradition comes to resemble the Spanish tradition of
the border in the limited number of forms and the
relative simplicity of techniques of elaboration,
remembering that the Spanish ceramics of the border may represent a limited range of ceramic forms
compared to those available closer to trade centers. While this can be viewed as acculturation to
a Spanish lifestyle, we submit that it speaks more
to the maintenance of Native identity than to a
merging with Spanish ceramic styles. Here is a
brownware tradition, forged in antiquity, that survived until the 20th century. Furthermore, it was
the dominant ceramic type found in most of the
Paso del Norte, in the homes of people of Native
American descent, perhaps throughout the 19th
century. Thus, the persistence of a Native
brownware tradition is not about imitating Spanish ceramic styles, but about making a cultural
statement through the use of a local tradition.
The distinctive architectural style of the Socorro
Mission in the lower valley of El Paso provides
some insight into this dilemma (Figure 13). In its
construction details are implicit a merging of styles
that are not quite Spanish, although perhaps not
identifiably Native American. There is little question that acculturation to the Spanish lifestyle caused
a simplification of previous aboriginal lifeways,
but as in all such cases, it also served to strengthen
those patterns that did survive. Overall, for the Native American descendants of the lower valley, it
was not a question of learning to be Spanish in a
previously Native American world, but of learning
to be Indian in a Spanish-dominated world.

"Spanish Expeditions into Texas,''
by William C. Foster (1995)
A. Joachim McGraw and James E. Corbin

FOSTER'S PURPOSE

GOOD POINTS OF THE WORK

William Foster re-examined the routes of 11
Spanish Colonial expeditions that crossed the Rio
Grande and entered early Texas from 1689 to the
middle 18th century. He reviewed the exploration
accounts of Alonso de Leon in 1689 and 1690,
Teran de los Rfos (1691), Salinas Varona (1693),
Espinosa (1709), Domingo Ramon (1716), Alarcon
(1718), and Aguayo (1721). Foster also discussed
the military inspections of Rivera ( 1727) and Rub!
(1767), as well as an inspection of the missions by
Fray Solis in 1768.
Foster stated that his work grew out of frustration from the decades of inconsistencies and the
lack of agreement in previous research that attempted to describe these trails. His list of reprobate researchers who had contributed to his
confusion include Herbert Bolton, Carlos
Castaneda, Robert Weddle, and the Texas Department of Transportation.
Foster noted that the purpose of his study was
to correct misinterpretations, and for the first time
in the study of Texas history formulate a clear and
authoritative picture of where early Spaniards
traveled across Texas. To accomplish the
formidable task of retracing the exact day-by-day
location of four routes of exploration, three routes
of settlement, two courses of military inspections,
and a journey to inspect frontier missions (all of
which occurred throughout a century of dynamic
historical change), Foster set out across Texas with
diaries and maps in hand. His exact intent was to
track the former lines of march, to locate nightly
campsites and to verify their locations by on-site
inspection. In Foster's own words, his book did
that. We think not.

Foster's effort contributed several positive elements to the study of Spanish Colonial expeditions. First, his work offered the reader an
introduction to frontier expeditions that were significant to the state's early history. Second, his
book demonstrated that the study of early trails can
lead to a substantial body of untapped information
applicable to a wide body of multi-disciplinary
studies. Finally, researchers may also use Foster's
interpretations as a comparison to their own or
other studies.
SHORTCOMINGS
The Lack of Historic Context
The volume purports to provide highly accurate
maps of the 11 expeditions, review modern detailed
topographic maps, aerial photos, and on-site
inspections (Foster 1995:8-9) to locate and verify
the routes and places of the expeditions. While it
may appear to the uninitiated that this book
accomplishes these tasks and utilizes these data to
the extent indicated, it is patently obvious to some
of those involved in Spanish Colonial research that
this volume falls far short in those areas. Although
he styles himself an historian, Foster seems to have
little faith in the direct historical approach-starting
with the known present and working backwardsused so well by ethnographers and archeologists. In
addition, Foster fails to utilize the strong multidisciplinary approach needed to conduct a study of
this nature. The shortcomings of Foster's research
involves two considerations that must be recalled
while practicing objective historiography: (1) the

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 70 (1999)

440

Texas Archeological Society

importance of presenting information within a
clearly formulated historic context, and (2) the
immediate and subsequent consequences of
employing an insular research strategy.
Foster's effort consisted of a descriptive narrative liberally interspersed with unverified subjective interpretations and the occasional gratuitous
comment. Although he attempted to more clearly
define historic trails by reviewing the journals of
early travelers, Foster did not compare nor contrast
the differing contexts of individual expeditions. His
introduction did offer a brief (five-page) overview
of the historical setting, a description of his methodology, and brief comments on Indian tribes.
Not being an anthropologist, Foster may be
forgiven for not recognizing the distinction between
Indian groups, chiefdoms and "tribes," but the implication of misused critical terminology is troubling, as is his inaccurate identification of
inter-regional Indian trails as "Tejas trade routes"
(Foster 1995:2-3 and Map I). The collective misuse
of such terms results in the inadvertent genesis of a
non-existent antecedent cultural universe.
Foster's work makes no distinction between
routes of exploration, settlement, and commerce,
although historically, Spaniards themselves distinguished between them. These routes varied greatly
in historical significance; for example, a route of
exploration or to create missions and settlements
(entrada) would have a greater impact on the historical record than a route of inspection (visitas) by
missionaries. Nor did he address the different purposes of travelers or the rationale that caused variations in their routes. For instance, an expedition
intent on exploration or establishing settlements did
not follow the same route as a military or ecclesiastical company intending to inspect outposts or
missions. Furthermore, the circuitous journeys of
the latter did not necessarily reflect unrecognized
segments of a single previously established trail.
Instead, military and religious travelers often followed segments of several different routes to reach
their destinations.
Foster's lack of thematic and historic contexts
for synchronic and diachronic route variations is
troubling. It leaves the reader following the tracks
of individual expeditions in an historic landscape
barren of descriptions regarding dynamic cultural
interactions or the influences of their inter-relationships. French, Spanish, Indian, European, military,
political, and ecclesiastical influences motivated

these expeditions. The lack of context in Foster's
work precipitated two subsequent effects: (1) no
clear discussion of the inter-relationship and evolution of differing routes throughout his research period, and (2) the general reader lacks information
on other contemporary, related roads, significant
route variations, or the importance of regional segments that collectively formed the larger routes that
Foster examined.
The Consequences of
Insular Research
Foster's second critical shortcoming, the use
of an insular research strategy, conjures up a host
of methodological demons. The immediate and subsequent consequences of this approach plague both
the veracity of his interpretations and the usefulness of his study as a technical resource. In short,
Foster's methodological approach is dominated by
unequivocal subjectivity. Invariably, this results in
prejudicial conclusions that, despite his insistence
otherwise, lack any physical evidence or archeoIogical verification.
The imperfection of Foster's approach is illustrated in four areas of his study: (1) the questionable verification of many of his own findings; (2)
misinterpretation of translations and simple factual
errors; (3) the selective and subjective use of historical data; and (4) the casual and recurrent misuse
of specialized terminology.

Map Details Are Important
The questionable verification of Foster's own
findings reside in the confidence level of his
research methods. We are well aware of the timeconsuming effort required to verify even one
location along a single route (as we have done this
successfully ourselves). We question Foster's lack
of specificity in how he verified specific locations
along multiple routes Which segments and locations
did he actually verify by using maps, aerial
photographs, and on-ground inspections? It is
unclear how he used these data, what evidence
resulted, and why he did not revisit or inspect locales
previously identified by others. Foster's lack of
specificity means that anyone needing precise
locations (e.g., archeologists) will need to redo his
work in much more detail. For example, Foster

McGraw and Corbin -A Review Essay of "Spanish Expeditions into Texas"
(1995:119) states, " ... Santa Clara, near present
Centerville in Leon County ... " Based on his maps
and his conclusion that Santa Clara is half-way
between the Navasota and Trinity rivers, "near" is
about 15 miles south of Centerville.
Foster's "detailed" maps are in fact not detailed enough for anything except for presenting a
very generalized picture of where routes were located. In several locations, such as the crossings of
the Trinity and Neches Rivers and at the San Pedro
Creek locality, the maps are very inaccurate or just
plain wrong. Foster constantly refers to verifying
locations of campsites and routes on modern geological maps. Unfortunately, the only modern maps
he consistently references are large scale
(1 :250,000) USGS geological-topographic maps on
which little or no geology (except to a trained geologist) is evident and almost none, if any, of the
types of features mentioned by the diarists are visible, even though Foster claims that they are. Such
maps do not show soils, geologic formations, or
types of vegetation. Unfortunately, maps of this
scale are only useful for initial planning purposes,
but not as evidence for routes and places eventually
identified during the study.
Most of the specific details observed on the
various expeditions cannot, contrary to Foster's
view, be identified on these maps because the scale
is too large or the maps do not show the kinds of
geologic, topographic, soil, or vegetative features
recorded in the diaries. Stream features (such as
direction) that seem evident on a 1:250,000 map
appear very different on a map scaled at 1:24,000
since the latter is ten times more detailed.
While Foster relies heavily on the 1:250,000
scale maps and a vegetation map (at an even larger
scale), he consistently ignores other kinds of
contemporary maps or data presented via maps.
For example, there is nothing that indicates what
aerial photos (e.g., USDA photos from the early
1940s, contemporary infrared photos, etc.) were
utilized or how these provided verification of
localities or routes.
In addition to the 7.5' or 15' topographic maps
alluded to above, there are detailed soils maps
available (scale 1:24,000) that present the soils and
associated topography and vegetation at a scale that
is more comparable, in a sense, to what the Spanish diarists actually could have seen and often did
report. Thus, if a diarist reports a small prairie in a
location, it will not appear on the large scale veg-

441

etation maps (because the prairie is too small); it
will not show on the 1:250,000 scale maps, nor
even show on the 1:24,000 scale maps, because
their primary function is not to show vegetation or
soil. The soil will be illustrated on the soils map as
a biologic regime, even if the prairie is not there
physically, because the prairie soil (very distinctive
and easily identified by soil scientists) is still there.
In addition to not using recent topographic maps
of a relevant scale, soils maps, and true geologic
maps, Foster seems to studiously avoid later historical maps of the region in question. While he
seems to rely heavily on known and hitherto unknown or unused Spanish maps, he almost never
mentions later historic maps of the region, particularly mid-19th century county deed maps, or late
19th and early 20th century geologic maps and
associated studies.
An 1891 geologic study of Houston County
describes and illustrates a small prairie known as
Murchison's Prairie (Dumble 1892:21 and Plate
II). For example: (1) based on Dumble's map; (2)
the Juan Pedro Walker map of 1806; (3) the description of a paraje referred by De Mezieres
(Bolton 1914:309) as the "prairie called Castano"
(which is referenced by the same name at the
same place on earlier expeditions, including descriptions by Rivera and La Fora); (4) the calls for
the Procella grant that reference the prairie as well
as start in the northeast corner of the grant at the
right side of the road to Bexar (Procella 1833);
and (5) the contemporary soils map of the area
that clearly identifies this small, but very important prairie, we can, with a high degree of confidence, locate one of the important parajes of this
region. In addition, we can also verify the location
of the normal route (Corbin 1991:197-199) for
most of the expeditions into the San Pedro Creek
valley. This location could never have been identified using USGS maps of any scale (certainly
not maps at a 1:250,000 scale), geologic maps, or
current large scale vegetation maps.
Foster's Expeditions
The mistranslating and/or misinterpretation of
text occurs in several critical points in Foster's
work as he reviewed routes across East and South
Texas. At the least, he does not furnish the reader
with other references or sources that would question his view.

442

Texas Archeological Society
Foster's Trails in Central
and East Texas

In Central Texas, the dilemma of the Brazos
River crossing(s) illustrates Foster's obvious antipathy towards differing views on that subject. Unfortunately, Foster appears so determined that his
view prevails, that he may have manufactured data
in at least one place to support his interpretation.
Foster (1995:169) writes " ... Rivera reached the
paraje called Los Angeles near the crossing of the
Brazos at the junction of the Little Brazos River
' ... a short distance above the junction of the two
streams."' Foster appears to indicate to us that he is
quoting Rivera's diary. Perusal of the translation of
Rivera's diary (Jackson and Foster 1995:33) does
not reveal the passage " ... a short distance above the
junction of the two streams." The passage in that
volume says, " ... we crossed the Colorado (or Brazos
de Dios) near the place where its two branches join
to form one river." Indeed, Foster's note at the
bottom of the page says, "The river crossing was a
few miles north of the juncture of the Brazos and
Little Brazos ... " If Foster was not quoting Rivera,
then he must have been quoting himself, but failed
to reference it. Either that, or a passage was left out
of the translation of Rivera's diary.
So strong is Foster's antipathy towards the
Texas Department of Transportation's study of the
routes of the various Spanish roads (McGraw et al.
1991 ), that he virtually glosses over the route between the Brazos and the Trinity rivers and between the Trinity River and Nacogdoches. He
almost totally ignores any previous discussion of
the crossing of the Trinity or Neches rivers, even
though his charts always show a confidence level
of "l" [high?] wherever his maps show the routes
crossing the Trinity and the Neches. Foster never
attempts to identify the crossing( s) of the Trinity or
Neches rivers, nor does he reference the latest works
that do indeed identify the main crossings. It is
clear that de Leon crossed the Trinity River downstream from all of the later crossings.
It is also quite clear that every other recorded
expedition to the Tejas, with the possible exception
of Varona, crossed the Trinity River at virtually the
same place: the Kickapoo Shoals/Hurricane Shoals
locality proposed by Williams (1979). Corbin
(1991) has demonstrated that Williams' conjecture
was indeed correct in that the old crossing at
Kickapoo Shoals or the adjacent Hurricane Shoals

meets all of the descriptions of the crossing. While
Foster makes no attempt to specifically identify the
crossing(s) in his text, his maps (which can have
only a very low level of accuracy at the scale illustrated) show all of the crossings, with the exception
of Ramon's, crossing the Trinity River well below
the shoals at a location not specifically discussed in
the book. On the scale of Foster's maps, the crossings appear to be placed about two to three miles
below the crossing Foster indicates was used by
Ramon, the Kickapoo/Hurricane Shoals location.
Yet in Table 6 and others following, Foster indicates a confidence level of "l" as to the certainty of
the location of the crossing on the Trinity River.
It is not clear whether this confidence level
indicates he is confident that the expedition crossed
the Trinity River or if he is confident of the actual
location of a crossing that was never described or
discussed. Assuming that Level "1" indicates a high
degree of confidence in the actual place of the crossing, Foster never discusses how he determined
where the crossing was nor indicates that he had
verified the location of the crossing using maps,
aerial photographs, deed records, or from an on the
ground inspection. In addition, he did not reference
previous investigations that demonstrated rather
convincingly that the crossing was the Kickapoo/
Hurricane shoals locality.
All of Foster's maps indicate that the expeditions that crossed the Neches River crossed above
its confluence with San Pedro Creek. Based on the
scale of his maps, this crossing is approximately
two miles upstream from the confluence. In actuality, the crossing is three miles below the mouth of
San Pedro Creek. In addition, it is clear from several of the dairies that once the expedition reached
the Caddo village, or the location of Mission San
Francisco, or the paraje at the old location of San
Francisco on San Pedro Creek (all in the valley),
the route was down (downstream meant going northeast) the valley to the crossing. Foster's maps show
the routes traversing the heavily wooded uplands
well north of the San Pedro Creek valley. The traditional route down the valley is the same route indicated in the Juan Pedro Walker map of ca. 1806
(Walker 1806). Walker's map clearly follows the
route described by Solfs (Kress 1931 :60-61) and La
Fora (Kinnard 1958: 165-66). Solfs says, "We forded
this river in shallow water and one league beyond
we climbed a hill. On the summit is a mound which
appears to be hand-made."

McGraw and Corbin -A Review Essay of "Spanish Expeditions into Texas"
At the spot where Foster indicates a crossing
of the Neches River on his maps, he indicates in his
charts at the end of the chapter a confidence level
of [1]. In reality, at least for some archeologists
who retentatively look, nothing is apparent there;
this is just an imaginary location created by Foster
at least two to three leagues from Solfs' mound at
the George C. Davis archeological site (a known
spot on the road mentioned at various times from
1767 to the 1850s). There is a shallow crossing
(UTM Easting 293222.524 and Northing
4295826.857 taken from direct GPS readings at the
crossing) approximately one league from the mound
site (see Corbin 1991:210) that is in the same vicinity as the one shown on the Walker map and can be
easily extrapolated from the 1848 and 1851 Cherokee County land grant maps (General Land Office
1848, 1851; see also the USGS 15' Alto map and
Stenzel's [1944] detailed geologic map of the locality). There is nothing in any line of investigation
that places or locates a crossing at the spot indicated on Foster's maps.
At the San Pedro/Neches locality, Foster
(1995:74) indicates a confidence level of [1] for
the location of Mission Santissima Nombre de
Maria. As far as we are aware, no one knows
where the location of this short-lived mission was
located. Teran (Hatcher 1932:29) indicated that it
was one league above the crossing of the Neches
and 1.5 leagues northeast of Mission San Francisco (Hatcher 1932:38). If Foster's maps of the
location of the crossing are accurate and we place
Mission Nombre de Maria upstream one league,
then the location of Mission San Francisco would
be well out of the San Pedro Creek valley, contrary to where all other documents place it (see
Corbin 1991, 1994).
The lack of historical context in Foster's interpretations often lead to singular conclusions without
regard to other reasonable explanations. In some
cases, his reading of documents appear to be limited
to a specific passage that supports his interpretation,
when in fact, the document in its entirety suggests
no such thing. This is complicated further since
Foster did not distinguish between routes of exploration, foundation, and settlement, the subsequent
network of roads that resulted, and the later, individual routes of inspection by military and religious
companies. We believe the importance of these types
of routes varied greatly, given the magnitude of
impact that a particular type of expedition route

443

might have had in the historical record.
These shortcomings are illustrated in his
conclusions (Foster 1995:188, 223) about the
abandonment of an upper route of the "Camino
Real" in the middle 18th century in favor of a lower
"Camino Real." Foster noted that a religious
company and several military expeditions used this
route that led south from San Antonio toward La
Bahfa and then swung northward toward the
Colorado and Brazos rivers. First, the reader should
note that he references routes of inspection, and the
expeditions associated with them were likely to
switch from one road to another (see also our
comments below on Fray Solfs' route in South
Texas). Second, his attempt to support the
conclusion that an upper route was abandoned at
that time included a reference to the trip of Athanase
de Mezieres, .who also traveled this lower route
"Camino Real" in 1778.
The reason for de Mezieres' trip, not mentioned by Foster, was to locate and propose alliances with major Indian groups throughout the
province via a trail that led to the newly founded
settlement of Pilar de Bucareli on the Trinity River.
The circuitous route of de Mezieres included trips
to Spanish Fort at the Red River in modern
Montague County and west along the Brazos River.
The complete journey also included a return trip to
San Antonio in the following year by de Mezieres,
traveling on the upper route that Foster had proposed was abandoned and in disuse. This is clearly
evident in de Mezieres' letter of the trip that described a well-known landmark along the upper
route, namely the springs of the San Marcos River,
about 30 miles south of modern Austin.
Foster also did not discuss the relevant comments of Carlos Castaneda (1939, Vol. IV:312). If
Foster postulated that an upper route to San Antonio had been abandoned, hence a roundabout trail
by way of La Bahia, why did Castaneda write 60
years ago that the future town site of Bucareli was
placed near the Paso Tomas crossing of the Trinity
River because in part:
This seems to have been at the point
where the two roads leading to Los Adaes
and La Bahia from San Antonio joined to
form a passage over this stream.
Castaneda (1939, Vol. IV:317) later noted that
communication between Bucareli and San Antonio

444

was claimed not as difficult as previously assumed,
in part because:
There was no other danger than attack
from Comanches between the Guadalupe
and San Antonio by the lower road, or
from the Colorado by the upper road.
The Elusive Hondo of South Texas

A major point of Foster's regional interpretation is the direction of routes from the vicinity of
the modern Frio River northward. He noted that
previous researchers have not recognized the historical transposition of place names of various
streams. Foster suggests that the original name of
the modern Leona River was the Sarco, named by
Alonso de Leon in 1689, and that most later expedition leaders called it the Frio. According to Foster, the confusion was compounded by de Leon
also giving the name of Hondo to the present-day
Frio River (Foster 1995:225). Foster does not inform the reader that scholars have proposed this
idea as early as 1901 and others more recently,
such as Richard Santos (1981: 116, endnote 86),
continue to do so.
In Foster's case, this interpretive view was
particularly important as he postulated that de Leon
turned eastward from the Hondo, or in Foster's
estimation, the modern Frio River. In addition, at
that locale, de Leon described Indian rock carvings
in the shape of crosses there and thus named the
locale Las Cruces. Foster's discussion chided a State
Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT) study for proposing the location of
Las Cruces as being on the modern Hondo Creek,
somewhat north of his projection. In 1990, the
SDHPT had recently located an early 19th century
historical site that contained graffiti carved on a
massive rock outcropping near the remnant segment of a regional Spanish Colonial road. Foster
noted that since de Leon's journal clearly indicated
the Hondo flowed east and southeast from Las
Cruces, this precluded any serious consideration of
the SD HPT findings. Indeed, Foster's maps showed
the modem Hondo Creek flowing north to south.
Whether Foster is correct (we think not) is not
the point nor the issue. In any case, archeological
work is required to clarify the location of the former
crossing. More important in the presentation of his
data and argument is why he did not offer a clear

discussion of other primary sources, such as the
journal entry of Fray Isidro de Espinosa who crossed
the Sarco River in 1709 and wrote, " ... the Indians
call it the Rio Frio ... " (Tous 1930:4). Espinosa then
went on to cross the Hondo. While he noted
Espinosa's comment in Chapter Six of his book,
Foster did not clearly explain the apparent incongruity of how Espinosa's Frio, unequivocally identified as the Sarco, is also Foster's Hondo.
We also question why Foster did not review
local maps of the area rather than those of regional
scales. He would have found that while the modem
Hondo Creek generally flows north to south, at the
location he discounts, its channel turns almost 90
degrees. Certainly this locale warrants further study.
While we will not lose any sleep over the final
location of this specific paraje, we wonder in the
interim if Foster had not inadvertently hoisted himself on his own paraje [cf. petard] by his unequivocal and somewhat forced march to the Hondo.
In addition, when the Teran-Mazanet expedition of 1691 reached the Hondo (wherever that
was), Mazanet noted that they were diverging from
the route of the two previous expeditions (our best
guess, these being the de Leon expeditions of 1689
and 1690 [Hatcher 1932:54]). The 1691 expedition
traveled about 16 leagues further (about 42 miles)
from that point to their stop on the San Antonio
River (in the vicinity of modem San Antonio). This
correlates well with the actual distance from the
locale on the modem Hondo Creek to the San Antonio River if moving in a generally northeasterly
direction as the expedition described. On the other
hand, the minimum distance from San Antonio
southward to the modern Frio River or Foster's
Hondo, ranges between 55-60 miles (21-23 leagues).
The difference between these distances is unacceptably large, by Foster's own standards.
Perhaps more important in an objective
discussion of the elusive Hondo is Foster's omission
of supplementary information that both described
and defined the location of commonly cited
historical landmarks along the route leading to and
from the Hondo, such as the Charco de Pita and the
Arroyo Payayas. These landmarks and other
features, including a Spanish Colonial route used in
1776, have been referenced by previous researchers
(McGraw et al. 1991:144). The value of this
reference is that the mentioned landmarks became
embedded in 19th century land grant records and
their locations can be accurately transferred to

McGraw and Corbin -A Review Essay of "Spanish Expeditions into Texas"
modem maps. Certainly, the information contained
in this document and adjacent land grant records
dating to the Spanish Colonial period are critically
relevant to any interpretation of the region's
historic landscape.
On a regional perspective, Foster's view of
historic routes in southern Texas failed to include
or address other contemporary routes that were employed by the travelers he discussed. This was illustrated in his Map 2 (Foster 1995:4) titled
"Spanish Road Network in Northeastern New Spain
according to Expedition Diaries, 1689-1768." Foster omitted the Lower Presidio Road, or Camino de
en Media, from San Antonio to the Rio Grande and
even excluded the San Antonio-Laredo Road, although his Chapter 12 (Foster 1995:197-214) reviewed the route of Fray Gaspar Jose de Solfs who
apparently traveled segments of both on his return
trip to the Rio Grande. Foster noted that Solfs traveled the Laredo Road after leaving San Antonio but
did not mention that Solfs stopped at the mission
ranch El Atascosa belonging to Mission San Jose y
San Miguel de Aguayo, in San Antonio (Kress
1931 ). The historic alignments of both roads are
reasonably well known in this area. Thus, Solfs'
visit to El Atascosa is curious since other accounts
not referenced by Foster (e.g., the travels of Morfi
in 1777-1778) state that the trail we know today as
the Lower Presidio Road was the boundary of the
lands claimed by Mission Espada (Mission San
Jose's lands, including the ranch of El Atascosa,
would have been west of the trail).
Curiously, the Laredo Road was east of all this
and would have traversed the lands claimed by
Mission Espada. Foster's simple statement that Fray
Solfs traveled the Laredo Road, while we know he
visited the mission ranch belonging to Mission San
Jose, is an incongruity that deserves explanation or
at least discussion. Lacking that, it hints at the ordinary ease with which historical travelers casually
moved from one route to another.

CONCLUSIONS
William Foster's (1995) Spanish Expeditions
into Texas set out to describe, explain, and prove
much. Foster focused on defining the exact routes
of travel associated with his selected Spanish
Colonial expeditions. The result, it appears, falls
short of his intended purpose. Because of Foster's

445

subjective, selective, and often limited treatment of
the subject, serious readers and researchers must
still consult and compare the previous works that
Foster himself found so frustrating.
The difference between Foster's intent and his
accomplishment is in part due to the complexity of
the subject. Retracing the patterns and landmarks
of historic routes requires an integrated
multidisciplinary methodology and a level of research detail sometimes beyond the scope of the
individual researcher. As important, it may be the
focus of Foster's effort-the attempt to clearly define each point of each obscure trail-that limit his
success. Foster often places points along his trails
without consulting local archival documents that
describe pertinent elements of the cultural-historical setting. The recognition of significant elements
within that cultural-historical setting often lead to
serendipitous findings more important than relocating the probable locale of an obscure campsite.
Perhaps that is what is lacking and most disturbing
in Foster's self-described exhaustive study: any
mention of serendipitous findings that are inherent
in such work. The real contribution of historic trail
studies is not to more clearly document the historical changes of these trails but more importantly, to
permit a better understanding of the peoples and
events that created these changes.

Response to a Review Essay of
''Spanish Expeditions into Texas, 1689-1768''
William C. Foster

The purpose of this is to respond to a review
essay by Al McGraw and Jim Corbin (this volume) on my 1995 book Spanish Expeditions into
Texas, 1689-1768. First, I would like to express
my appreciation to Timothy K. Perttula, Texas
Archeological Society Publications Editor, for soliciting my response. His offer was gracious and is
hereby accepted.
As noted by the reviewers, it is helpful to give
readers the "historic context" or a brief background
statement on the topic at hand. As background, it
should be noted that the principal issues concerning
expedition route projections raised by the reviewers are not new; the differences and criticisms arose
over five years ago.
It started this way. In January 1991, the
Highway Design Division of the Texas State
Department of Highways and Public Transportation
(today, TxDOT) released a study entitled A Texas
Legacy, The Old San Antonio Road and the Caminos
Reales, A Tricentennial History, 1691-1991
(McGraw et al. 1991). In the report, Al McGraw is
identified as the "Project Director," Elizabeth
Robbins (who prepared articles on expedition
routes) is named as a member of the project staff
for "Historical Review and Report Production," and
Jim Corbin is listed as one of nine "Contributors"
(p. iii). The TxDOT study projects the day-by-day
line of march of Alonso De Leon's Expedition of
1689 (pp. 63-65); Alonso De Leon's Expedition of
1690 (pp. 66-69); Domingo Teran's itinerary on his
1691 expedition (pp. 72-74) with accompanying
maps; Fray Damian Massanet's 1691 itinerary (pp.
76-80); Salinas Varona' s 1693 expedition with
accompanying maps (pp. 82-88); Fray Isidro Felix
de Espinosa' s 1709 itinerary (pp. 354-357);
Domingo Ramon's expedition of 1716 (pp. 90-95);
Fray Isidro Felix de Espinosa's 1716 itinerary (pp.

96-103); Fray Francisco de Celiz' 1718 itinerary of
the Martin de Alarcon expedition (pp. 358-363);
and Antonio de la Pena's 1721 itinerary of the
Marques de Aguayo expedition (pp. 105-113). Thus,
the 1991 TxDOT study and my 1995 book cover
the same expeditions, except my 1995 work also
includes Pedro Rivera's 1727 military expedition,
the Marques de Rubi's 1767 military expedition,
and Fray Jose de Solis's 1768 mission inspection
tour.
In October 1993, two years before my book
Spanish Expeditions into Texas, 1689-1768 was
published, the Southwestern Historical Quarterly
published an article Jack Jackson and I edited that
included the first fully annotated English translation of the 1693 expedition of Governor Salinas
Varona from Monclova to the East Texas mission
field (Foster and Jackson 1993). In the annotations
to the Salinas Varona diary account, we critically
noted a number of mistakes in the projection of De
Leon's 1689 route and Salinas Varona' s route found
in McGraw's TxDOT route study, differences that
McGraw and Corbin raise again in their review.
Moreover, my 1995 projection of De Leon's 1689
route is repeated in Imaginary Kingdom, Texas as
seen by the Rivera and Rubi Military Expeditions,
1727 and 1767, a study of military expedition routes
that Jack Jackson and I completed in late 1995.
The first area of difference centered on the
specific question of whether Alonso De Leon (in
1689 and 1690) and Salinas Varona (in 1693) were
referring to the present-day Leona River or the Frio
River when they wrote that they crossed the "Rio
Frio," and whether they were referring to the
present-day Frio River or the Hondo when they
wrote that they camped on the "Rio Hondo." This
issue will be treated in more detail at the appropriate place later, but the 1993 comment made by

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 70 (1999)

448

Texas Archeological Society

Jackson and I that kicked off the route dispute
should be noted here as part of the background. We
wrote in 1993 (Foster and Jackson 1993:286-287,
fn. 59):
The fact that the name Frio was used by
expedition leaders to identify the Leona,
and the Hondo was used for the modern
Frio, has confused some historians. This
confusion is reflected in the recent study
A Texas Legacy, which assumes that
Texas rivers in colonial times had their
present names. This assumption has led
to some serious problems with their route
projections and analysis-particularly
with those of early expeditions, including that of Salinas.
In the 1993 Southwestern Historical Quarterly
article, Jackson and I were also critical of McGraw's
TxDOT study of Salinas Varona' s route to the San
Antonio River (Foster and Jackson 1993:289, fn.
66), an area of dispute also revisited by the reviewers of my book. And when Salinas reached the
Colorado, the route problem and the correct identification of the current names of Texas rivers arose
again. At that point in the 1993 article, Jackson and
I (Foster and Jackson 1993:293-294, fn. 77) noted:
Despite the consistent use of the name
San Marcos for the Colorado by the Spaniards, Elizabeth A. Robbins incorrectly
postulates that the river that Salinas called
San Marcos and crossed on May 28 was
the present-day San Marcos ... This type
of error is likely to occur if route projections are made without an understanding
of the names of rivers used during the
historical period studied.
This summary of my 1993 critical comments
on McGraw's 1991 study confirms my earlier observation that route issues now argued by the reviewers regarding my 1995 book on Spanish
expeditions are not new questions but rather arose
about five years ago. Now to McGraw's and
Corbin's direct criticisms of my book.
The reviewers make two attempts to state the
purpose of my book, both inaccurate. First they
write, "The purpose of this study was to correct
misinterpretations, and for the first time in the study

of Texas history, formulate a clear and authoritative picture of where early Spaniards traveled across
Texas." The second attempt, made in the same paragraph, states, "His exact intent was to track the
former lines of march, to locate nightly campsites
and to verify their location by on-site inspection."
The reviewers omitted any reference to the specific
narrow purpose of my book, which I stated directly
in my introduction: "The central purpose of this
study is to track as precisely as possible the route
followed on each of the eleven expeditions" (Foster
1995:7). It was that; no less, no more.
My 1995 book is a geographical expedition
route study that focuses on the number of leagues
and the direction traveled daily (as recorded in the
expedition diaries), on the correct modern names of
the rivers and creeks crossed, and on the terrain,
Indian tribes or bands, fauna, and flora encountered
along the line of march. It did not focus on changes
in Spanish colonial policies on the frontier, Spanish
and French rivalry, or correcting misinterpretations
of earlier authors. Nevertheless, it did compare my
projections with those found in earlier Spanish expedition route studies. This analysis was appropriate and essential. It is true that on occasion my
projections differed (and on other occasions aligned)
with route projections of Herbert E. Bolton, Carlos
E. Castaneda, and Robert S. Weddle, among others.
It is also true that my route projections seldom
coincided with those proposed in McGraw's 1991
study.
The reviewers address the "shortcomings" of
my work by first discussing three general topics of
concern and then identifying specific disputes with
regard to my route projections. My response addresses the three general topics of concern in the
order presented by the reviewers.

GENERAL TOPICS OF CONCERN
The reviewers' first concern is entitled "The
lack of historical context." Here the reviewers acknowledge that in the 15 page introduction I give
an overview of the historical setting along with a
description of my methodology and provide comments on Indian tribes, but the reviewers suggest
that more is needed. They argue that descriptions
are lacking regarding the "French, Spanish, Indian,
European, military, political and ecclesiastical influences [that] motivated these expeditions." It is

Foster- Response to a Review Essay of "Spanish Expeditions into Texas,
true; I did not focus on the multiple political and
cultural influences that may have motivated the
expeditions. That subject has been developed in
detail by Bolton, Castaneda, Weddle, David J. Weber, Donald E. Chipman, and others. Instead, as I
emphasized in my statement of the purpose of the
study, I focused on where (not why) the expeditions moved across Texas. I found no serious lack
of historical studies musing on conflicting European cultural influences and rivalries of the period;
the limited need I saw was for improved geographical precision regarding where the expeditions went
and their daily line of march.
It appears to me that my Introduction adequately
meets the needs of the study and the general reader
with regard to historical background. However, the
reviewers may have a better perspective on this
matter with regard to the use of my work by archeologists and their possible interest in a fuller political and ecclesiastical background piece.
The title to the second general area of concern
is, "The consequences of insular research." The
reviewers assert that this charge "conjures up a host
of methodological demons," and that, "In short,
Foster's methodological approach is dominated by
unequivocal subjectivity." Not true.
In my Introduction, as noted by the reviewers,
my methodology is expounded. As stated, it is based
principally on information given in expedition diary accounts regarding the direction and number of
leagues traveled each day. The direction was based
on compass readings, and the number of leagues
traveled daily (usually only four to seven) as estimated by experienced frontiersmen. These are reasonably objective measures and the daily route
projection can often be verified using physical evidence. This objective evidence included the location, size, and direction of flow of creeks and rivers
that frequently (every three to five days) intersected
the line of march, as noted in the diaries; reports of
heavily wooded areas such as the Post Oak Belt
(called the Monte Grande) or of open prairies; and
the identification of critical landforms such as the
prominent bluff near La Grange named "Jesus,
Maria y Joseph Buena Vista" by De Leon in 1690
and called Monument Hill today. My methodology
is not dominated by "unequivocal subjectivity."
Another methodological "demon" raised by the
reviewers is that I employed "insular research" in
that my research was conducted in isolation, without
the benefit of review and comment by recognized

1689~1768"

449

archeologists, anthropologists, or historians. That
false impression should also be corrected.
My manuscript was submitted to the University of Texas Press, which subjected it to vigorous
review. Frankie Westbrook, a distinguished and
highly experienced acquisitions editor, first carefully reviewed the project and discussed with me
the methodology used and the qualifications of
the translators. Satisfied, she then presented it for
in-house review to the entire editorial staff, including Theresa May, who was then Senior Editor
and is now the Assistant Director of the Press, and
Jack Kyle, then Director of the Press. Shannon
Davies, the science and natural history editor, made
important suggestions for expansion of the information on the flora and fauna found along the
routes. Westbrook determined that the work merited submission to the customary peer review process required of all University of Texas Press
books, and she submitted my manuscript to three
highly competent readers for their comments and
recommendations. Professors Thomas N. Campbell,
David J. Weber, and Donald E. Chipman-all topranked scholars in this field-read my manuscript
for the Press, and each of them offered helpful
comments.
Professor Campbell, perhaps the most distinguished authority on Texas Indians and expedition
routes, strongly urged the Press to publish my manuscript. In closing his comments on the manuscript,
David Weber concluded (for attribution) "To have
a single authoritative source for these early expeditions [is] enormously helpful... Foster's work [is]
the most authoritative on the subject." Weber,
Campbell, and Chipman notified the Press that their
identity as readers could be disclosed.
After receiving the comments and recommendations of the readers, Westbrook and May advanced my revised manuscript to the Faculty
Advisory Committee for approval of its publication
by the Press. After full consideration, the Committee voted unanimously to publish the manuscript.
McGraw and Corbin appear unfamiliar with the
depth and scope of the peer review process imposed on prospective authors and their manuscripts
by university presses generally and particularly by
the University of Texas Press. In summary, there
was no "insular" research.
The third area of general concern expressed by
the reviewers relates to my use of United States
Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps

450

Texas Archeological Society

(1 :250,000) that include detailed information on
elevations, heavily wooded areas, and open prairies. The reviewers suggest that more detailed maps
were required and their criticism is capsuled in
their following comment: "Foster's lack of specificity means that anyone needing precise locations
(e.g., archeologists) will need to redo his work in
much more detail... Foster's 'detailed' maps are in
fact not detailed enough for anything except for
presenting a very generalized picture of where the
routes were located."
First, to avoid reader confusion, it might be
helpful in discussing large- and small-scale maps,
to define the terms. According to Webster's Third
New International Dictionary, "large-scale map"
means having a scale that permits plotting of much
detail with comparatively great exactness (Gove
1986: 1273), and "small-scale map" means having a
scale that permits plotting of comparatively little
detail (Gove 1986:2149). These are the meanings I
intend when I use the terms; I am not sure of the
meanings of the terms intended by the reviewers.
For example, the reviewers correctly note that I use
"large scale (1 :250,000) USGS geological topographic maps," but then are critical because "the
specific details observed on the various expeditions
cannot, contrary to Foster's view, be identified on
these maps because the scale is too large." Obviously, if the scale had been smaller, there would
have been even less detail. I fear that the confusion
resulted from the failure of the reviewers to understand the correct technical meaning of the standard
cartographic term they used.
My response to this basic criticism is that the
detail of my route projections is determined by the
route information regarding the direction and distance traveled daily found in the expedition diaries,
and not by the scale of the map I used to reflect the
information. In fact, a more detailed larger-scale
map could be misleading, suggesting to the reader a
degree of specificity beyond that found in the diary.
The USGS 1:250,000 Series maps cover with
each individual map (size ca. 1.5 feet by 2.5 feet)
the area within one degree latitude (ca. 70 miles)
and two degrees longitude (ca. 120 miles). Thus,
for example, De Leon's 1689 expedition route into
Texas was plotted from the Rio Grande to the
Guadalupe during the two-week march of about
200 miles using four USGS maps (Seguin NH 149; San Antonio NH 14-8; Crystal City 14-11; and
Eagle Pass NH 14-10). The detail in the maps was

sufficient that creek and river crossing areas could
be identified, allowing the general route to be plotted
as precisely as possible from the diary accounts.
The distance of the daily march was given by the
diarist in Spanish leagues (each is the equivalent of
2.6 miles), which by definition limits specificity.
But the specificity is nevertheless sufficient to help
ethnogeographers locate where De Leon and other
diarists encountered named Indian tribes during the
daily march, to aid botanists and zoologists
interested in the range and distribution of Texas
plants and animals in the 17th and 18th centuries,
and to help archeologists focus on areas of possible
interest.
In addition, the reviewers note that I relied on
"the 1:250,000 scale maps and a vegetation map (at
an even larger scale)." The "vegetation map (at an
even larger scale)" referred to by the reviewers is
the 1986 Texas General Land Office map entitled
"Natural Heritage of Texas," which proved very
helpful in depicting the larger areas of dense woods
and vegetation such as the Post Oak Belt, and in
locating the narrow tongue of prairie land that runs
within the Post Oak Belt that expeditions followed
beginning in 1716. This "vegetation map (at an
even larger scale)" is in fact at a much smaller
scale, not a larger scale map, than the USGS
1:250,000 scale map.
Although the reviewers are confused in their
use of some standard cartographic terms, there appears to be no confusion about the charge that I
relied heavily "on known and hitherto unknown or
unused Spanish maps." The most frequently cited
"unknown or unused Spanish map" referenced in
my book was the ca. 1807 Puelles map reported by
Jack Jackson in the January 1988 issue of the Southwestern Historical Quarterly (Jackson 1988:317347). The Puelles map provides very detailed
information on the relative location and names of
over 20 crossings on the Guadalupe and San Antonio rivers used by Spaniards during the 1700s. It
was extremely helpful to compare the names and
locations of stream crossings used and named in
expedition diary accounts with those found on this
and other early Spanish maps. I believe my reliance
was well-placed and the criticism trivial.
The next and final general area of criticism
offered by the reviewers related primarily to questions regarding specific expedition routes. However, before identifying specific route issues the
reviewers make a general observation that "he does

Foster- Response to a Review Essay of"Spanish Expeditions into Texas, 1689-1768" 451
not furnish the reader with other references or
sources that would question his view." Not true.
All along the expedition routes, I call the reader's
attention where appropriate to earlier studies by
Herbert E. Bolton, Carlos Castaneda, Thomas N.
Campbell, Don Chipman, A. Joachim McGraw,
Timothy K. Perttula, Richard Santos, Robert
Thonhoff, Robert Weddle, J. W. Williams and others, citing the documents and page references in
which concurring or dissenting opinions had been
expressed. A typical example of the comparative
analysis found in my book is given regarding De
Leon's 1689 crossing of the San Antonio River. A
careful review of this issue raised by the reviewers
is warranted.
In my descriptive account of De Leon's initial
crossing of the San Antonio River, I note that I
project the river crossing area to be near the famous
"Conquista Crossing" in northwestern Karnes
County, whereas Bolton, Castaneda, and Weddle
place the fording area about eight to ten miles
downriver in central Karnes County. I also note in
my study that the 1991 TxDOT study projected the
San Antonio River crossing by De Leon to be about
45 miles upstream in Bexar County "below the
confluence of the modern Medina and San Antonio
rivers (McGraw et al. 1991: 62)"-far out of line
with that made in any earlier expedition route studies. The TxDOT study gives no comparative information of any kind. It does not mention where
Bolton, Castaneda, and Weddle projected the 1689
San Antonio River crossing to be or hint that the
TxDOT route projection is about 45 miles out of
line with earlier projections (see di~cussion in Foster 1995:22).

SPECIFIC ROUTE ISSUES
The specific issues raised by the reviewers regarding expedition routes and river crossings now
will be addressed in geographical sequence as the
expeditions marched from the Rio Grande north
and northeast to the present-day Nueces and Frio
rivers (and the Hondo-Frio mixup), to the San Antonio River (and the San Antonio-Medina name
change), along the Camino Real from San Antonio
to the Brazos, and lastly to the Trinity and Angelina
river crossings.
Most authorities agree that the four late 17th
century Spanish expeditions into Texas (in 1689,

1690, 1691, and 1693) crc,ssed the Rio Grande at or
near the crossing that was later called Paso de
Francia, located about five miles below the presentday Mexican community of Guerrero. From the
Rio Grande the expeditions marched along the same
general route to cross present-day Comanche Creek
and soon thereafter to ford the Nueces River a short
distance upstream from Crystal City. From the
Nueces crossing, De Leon in 1689 traveled about
18 miles (seven leagues) northeast to camp on the
present-day Leona River, which De Leon named
the Sarco and Massanet later called the Frio, thus
initiating the name mixup (see comments in Foster
1995:55-56). The following day (April 6th), De
Leon marched about 13 miles (five leagues) northeast to the modern-day Frio River, which he named
"Rio Hondo" because of its steep banks. That day,
De Leon's party found some large white rocks into
which crosses and other skillfully made figures had
been cut many years earlier.
The following day (April 7th), De Leon did not
cross the "Rio Hondo" (the Frio River), but rather
turned downstream and "went more than 4 leagues
down the river without crossing it, sometimes east,
sometimes southeast" (Bolton 1916:392). The
present controversy arose because McGraw argues
that on April 6th, when De Leon spotted the crosses
carved into large white rocks, the Governor's party
was not on the present-day Frio River but rather on
the present-day Hondo, mistakenly equating
present-day river names and locations for those used
in 1689. McGraw (McGraw et al. 1991: 131) writes,
The route [De Leon's 1689 route] then
crossed the Frio River. . .in the immediate vicinity of Old Frio Town in northwestern Frio County ... Approximately six
leagues northward, it forded the steep
Hondo Creek within a few hundred yards
of modern FM 2200 in southern Medina
County. This locale is believed to be De
Leon's Las Cruces. He observed that Indian petroglyphs in the shape of crosses
were carved on white rocks there.
SDHPT [now TxDOT] archeologists located a massive outcrop of grayish-white
sandstone in the vicinity of the old road
that was covered with weathered graffiti
dating to the 19th century.
In my 1995 book, I noted what I considered to
be a mistake in McGraw's projection of De Leon's

452

Texas Archeological Society

1689 route with regard to "Rio Hondo" and the
location of the large white rocks with crosses carved
or cut into them (Foster 1995:21, fn. 15). The conflict between my projection of De Leon's 1689
route and McGraw's projection persists as indicated in the reviewers' critical comment that
"Whether Foster is correct (we think not) is not the
point nor the issue" (emphasis added). I strongly
differ with the reviewers. I think that whether I am
correct or the reviewers are correct is a significant
issue; it was raised by them. A determination of the
location of the crosses cut into large white rocks on
the Frio River or Hondo would help confirm the
earliest Spanish expedition routes into Central
Texas. The following comments summarize my position regarding this question.
First, in projecting De Leon's 1689 line of
march from the Nueces northeastward for the first
two days, there is no difference between the general projection made in the 1991 TxDOT study and
my 1995 study. The difference is in the destination.
I have General De Leon crossing the Leona River
on the first day (April 5th) and then stopping on the
present-day Frio near Old Frio Town at the close of
the second day (Foster 1995:20-21). The TxDOT
study has the General crossing the Leona (called
the Frio), then on the second day crossing the
present-day Frio near Old Frio Town and continuing north-northeastward another 16 miles or six
leagues (a distance substantially beyond that recorded in the diary) to an area on the present-day
Hondo where the creek is intersected by FM 2200
(McGraw et al. 1991:131).
One problem with the TxDOT-McGraw projection is that to march northeast from the Nueces
crossing to the present-day Hondo, one must obviously cross two large rivers-the present-day Leona
and the Frio. De Leon mentions only crossing one
river after leaving the Nueces and arriving at the
"Hondo." De Leon only recorded crossing the
present-day Leona (which he named the "Sarco"
and Massanet later called the "Frio") before reaching the "Hondo."
As I mentioned at some length in my book,
Spanish expeditions into Texas in the late 1600s
were conducted during the climax of the Little Ice
Age (ca. 1350-1850), a global climatic period during which the weather was unusually cool and precipitation was exceptionally high in Texas, North
America, and Europe generally. This means that
the present-day Leona, Frio, and Hondo in the 1680s

and 1690s generally carried much larger volumes
of water than they do today, and therefore it is
extremely unlikely that the present-day Frio could
have been crossed without it being mentioned by
De Leon. It is very dangerous for writers to project
expedition routes assuming that the diarist whose
work is being followed will omit references to a
major river crossing.
A second problem with McGraw's projection
that I mentioned in my book concerns the direction
that Governor De Leon said the "Rio Hondo" was
flowing. The Governor said that the day after finding the crosses cut in the white stone on "the
Hondo," his party followed the river downstream
"sometimes east, sometimes southeast" for about
four leagues (10.4 miles) (Bolton 1916:392), and
marched on eastward after crossing the river at that
point. De Leon's description fits perfectly with my
projection, as the Frio from the vicinity of Old Frio
Town flows east and sometimes southeastward
about 10 miles, to join present-day Hondo Creek
(see USGS San Antonio NH 14-8 and Crystal City
NH 14-11). General De Leon's description does
not fit the TxDOT projection because the presentday Hondo Creek from its intersection with FM
2200 flows downstream southward, not eastward.
De Leon, an experienced frontiersman, had with
him a compass, and his compass directions are very
reliable. In fact, at the time, Spanish regulations
required that the official expedition diary include
the direction traveled each day and the number of
leagues marched (Hatcher 1932: 8). The latter was
to be recorded twice-once in the text and again in
the margin of the diary.
Had McGraw consulted other route studies and
noted the comparisons as I did (see Foster 1995:295,
fn. 13-14 and 296, fn. 15), his mistaken projection
would have been apparent. In 1979, J. W. Williams, the noted Texas historian of trails and expeditions, wrote that in 1689 De Leon left the Nueces
crossing north of Crystal City, traveled seven
leagues to the Leona River (which Massanet named
the Frio), and the following day continued another
five leagues to the Frio, which Williams says De
Leon named the Hondo.
Williams (1979:114) explains the Frio-Hondo
mixup this way:
Some way the names of several rivers in
this area seem to have been moved one
space to the east. The Leona, a stream of

Foster - Response to a Review Essay of "Spanish Expeditions into Texas, 1689-1768" 453
cold spring water, was long known to
the Indians as the Frio (cold). The name
now applies to the next river to the
east.. .. Also, the name Hondo has moved
east to the next river. .. [which] flows
southward into the Frio ... [and] is now
known as the Hondo.
Robert Weddle agreed with Williams' assessment
and writes, "Crossing the Rio Grande at Leon's
Paso de Francia, Teran followed the same trail as
far as the Rio Hondo (the Frio River), encountering
various Coahuiltecan bands along the streams"
(Weddle 1991:88). My projection of De Leon's
1689 route to the Frio and the location of "Las
Cruces" is in line with similar projections made
much earlier by highly regarded Texas historians,
experts in the field of expedition route projections.
My projection stands despite the criticisms submitted by the reviewers.
Not willing to give up on the issue, McGraw
adds, as further evidence in support of his Hondo
projection, that TxDOT has located a massive outcrop of grayish-white sandstone that is covered
with weathered graffiti. I certainly agree that the
identification of a location where there is a cross
cut with skill deeply into a large white rock on
either the Hondo or the Frio would help resolve
the question at hand. Recently, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of
Texas at Austin was notified of such a find on the
Frio River (41UV401), a short distance upriver
from my projected location of "Las Cruces." The
cross is very skilfully and deeply cut into a massive white smooth rock; the large cross measures
approximately three feet in height and two feet in
width. Further field work is planned for 1999 to
determine if other crosses or figures can be found
in similar large white rock outcrops downstream
on the Frio. This recently found prospect on the
Frio seems eminently more promising than
McGraw's reported sandstone outcrops covered
with 19th century graffiti on the Hondo.
Geographically moving eastward from the San
Antonio area, the next question raised by the reviewers is the route of the "Camino Real" from San
Antonio to the Spanish capitol of Texas at Los
Adaes in present-day Louisiana. As mentioned by
the reviewers, I conclude that the upper route of the
"Camino Real" that ran from San Antonio northeast to a crossing of the Colorado above Onion

Creek in Travis County, and on to the crossing of
the Brazos near its junction with the Little Brazos,
switched, probably in the 1730s or 1740s, to the
lower "Camino Real." The more southern or lower
route ran southeast from San Antonio along the
east bank of the San Antonio River to a point near
the mouth of Cibolo Creek in Karnes County, where
the royal road turned northeast to cross the
Guadalupe near Cuero (at or near Vado del
Gobernador), crossed the Colorado near La Grange,
and the Brazos near its junction with the Little
Brazos (Foster 1995:223). From the Brazos crossing, the Camino Real followed generally the route
eastward to the Trinity. Contrary to the statement
made by the reviewers, the lower Camino Real was
not "a roundabout trail by way of La Bahia." First,
the Lower Route was not a roundabout trail; it was
selected as the official government route or Camino
Real because it ran below the dense Post Oak Belt
which served as protection to travelers from the
mounted Apache in the north. Secondly, the Lower
Route did not go by way of the presidia and mission of La Bahia; the Camino Real turned east from
the San Antonio River over 30 miles upriver from
La Bahia.
The decision to shift the Camino Real southward to the lower route was not a casual or uninformed decision made by Spanish officials. As
mentioned, it was a very informed official decision
to avoid exposure to Spanish movements from
Apache attacks that had repeatedly occurred along
the upper road, particularly in the exposed open
prairie areas near and east of the Colorado River
crossing in eastern Travis and Williamson counties. A recent study of this question directed by
Congress and prepared by the National Park Service (NPS) concluded that the Spaniards had been
unable to keep open an identifiable and marked
trail along the Upper Route (see Section 3 of the
NPS map "El Camino Real de los Tejas" in National Park Service (1998:17-18]). Thus, the NPS
rejected the upper Camino Real route described as
the Camino Real in the McGraw-TxDOT study, as
I had rejected it in my 1995 study. The upper route
was simply not a viable, safe, dependable, and protected route for use by government officials, troops,
sponsored visitors, or those moving government
cargo and supplies.
The lower route, although longer, was more
secure because it ran south of the dense Post Oak
Belt across present-day DeWitt, Lavaca, and Fayette

454

counties. Moreover, the lower route picked up the
more open and elevated geological formation called
the Oakville Escarpment that runs between the San
Antonio River in Karnes County and the Colorado
River in eastern Fayette County. The switch in the
route of the Camino Real to the lower road, of
course, does not imply that the older upper route
was never used again by anyone; it was. But in the
1730s or 1740s, the official government route or
"Camino Real" became the Lower Route and official documents in the 1740s and later refer to the
lower road as the Camino Real. In the 1991 TxDOT
Camino Real study, this Lower Route was basically ignored in favor of the Upper Route, but in
the 1998 NPS study, the lower Camino Real was
proposed to Congress to be designated as the official "Camino Real de Los Tejas" and be added to
the federal government's system of National Historic Trails (National Park Service l 998:iii-iv).
The reviewers also questioned my projection
of the location of the crossing on the Trinity and
Angelina rivers. In my book, I indicate that the
Trinity crossing was near the fording area identified by the reviewers as the Kickapoo-Hurricane
Shoals location (see expedition maps in Foster
(1995:111, 129, 147, 163, 180]). The reviewers
seem to agree with my projection, but complain
that "On the scale of Foster's maps, the crossings
appear to be placed about two to three miles
below ... the Kickapoo-Hurricane Shoals location."
John Cotter, the cartographer who prepared the maps
in my book, drew the line of march at my direction
as precisely as the space on the page permitted. In
my view, the map correctly identifies the crossing
area, and I find no need to adjust by about one
league the route reflected on the map as suggested
by the reviewers.
With regard to the location of the crossing of
the Neches River, I indicate that the crossing was
above the mouth of San Pedro Creek. The reviewers differ. They argue that it was below the mouth
of the creek. In presenting their case, the reviewers cite the 1767-1768 diary of Fray Gaspar Jose
de Solis. I admit at this point to some frustration
and nervousness at the reviewers' casual mistakes
in citing the documentary record. The reviewers
write, "Solis says, 'We forded this river in shallow water and one league beyond we climbed a
hill. On the summit is a mound which appears to
be hand-made."' This is not accurate. There are
two translated versions of the Solis diary-one by

Peter P. Forrestal (1931) and a second by Mattie
Austin Hatcher (Kress 1931; the one inaccurately
cited by the reviewers). Neither version includes
material even remotely similar to that quoted by
the reviewers.
The two sentences quoted can be found not in
the 1768 Solis diary but in the 1767 diary kept by
Marques de Rubi's engineer Nicolas de Lafora
(Kinnaird 1958:165). The TxDOT study does not
include an itinerary or map for either expedition,
although in my book a chapter is devoted to each.
Neither Solis nor Lafora, nor any earlier expedition
journalist, specifically states whether the crossing
used was above or below the mouth of San Pedro
Creek. Diary accounts suggest that the parties approached the San Pedro Creek area in open terrain
north of the stream before reaching the Caddo villages. My interpretation is that the parties crossed
the Neches River above the mouth of San Pedro
Creek as no mention was made that a creek was
crossed immediately before reaching the Neches.
Moving eastward from the Neches crossing location that I project, a party would travel eastward
toward the hilly area mentioned by La Fora. I understand the position of the reviewers, but I stand
by my projection.
In summary, Corbin's projection and my projection of the location of the crossings on the Trinity and Neches rivers in East Texas differ by only
about one league. In contrast, the McGraw-TxDOT
projections and my projections of expedition routes
in South and Central Texas differ substantially. Historians and archeologists need to know whether De
Leon in 1689 found "Las Cruces" on Hondo Creek
(according to McGraw-TxDOT) or on the Frio River
as I project; whether on the same expedition De
Leon crossed the present-day San Antonio River in
Bexar County (McGraw-TxDOT) or about 40 miles
downstream in Karnes County; and finally, whether
the Camino Real from San Antonio ran northeast to
cross the Colorado River in Travis County
(McGraw-TxDOT) or southeast to cross the Colorado about 40 miles downstream in Fayette County
as the 1998 National Park Service study and I
project. The differences in these route projections
in South and Central Texas are very important and
substantial.
The reviewers conclude with the observation
that "The real contribution of historic trail studies
is not to more clearly document the historic changes
of these trails but more importantly, to permit a

Foster- Response to a Review Essay of "Spanish Expeditions into Texas, 1689-1768" 455
better understanding of the people and events that
created these changes." In conclusion, I could not
more fully disagree with the reviewers. Texas historians, including Bolton, Castaneda, Williams,
Weddle, Chipman, and others, have repeatedly
sought to document the specific routes of expeditions and to project their line of march. Only by
tracking as precisely as possible the line of march
followed on each expedition can we accurately identify where Texas Native people, animals, and plants
encountered along the route were geographically
located. This geographic information is of value to
numerous specialists interested in early historic and
prehistoric Texas, including archeologists, anthropologists, ethnohistorians, and also biogeographers,
who have recently contributed significantly to clarifying the route of Cabeza de Vaca (Olson et al.
1997: 175). Whereas some of our differences in
documentary route interpretation and route projections may be minor or involve only a few leagues,
my difference with the reviewers as to the purpose
and contribution of historic trail studies is immense
and fundamental.
The reviewers, both practicing archeologists
who have been associated with TxDOT, seem to be
unaware that traditional historical route studies can
assist in the design of archeological projects and
contribute to the interpretation of the physical record
(see Hester et al. 1997:52). For example, Michael
B. Collins and Grant D. Hall, two highly regarded
archeologists, cite my 1995 work on Spanish expedition routes in recent articles in the Bulletin of the
Texas Archeological Society (Collins 1995:386; Hall
1998:5). Moreover, in the introduction and notes to
the recently published book The La Salle Expedition to Texas, I referenced over 20 archeological
studies and reports that helped interpret and enrich
Henri Jou tel' s journal (Foster 1998). Rather than
restricting the field of inquiry for historians, as
proposed by the reviewers, other scholars and specialists that are interested in the field should be
encouraged to commingle more frequently and share
the results of their studies of the early historic and
prehistoric periods.

Radiocarbon Dating of Rangia cuneata:
Correction Factors and Calibrations
for the Galveston Bay Area

Karl W. Kibler

ABSTRACT
In the past, a variety of correction and calibration methods have been used by archeologists to bring
radiocarbon assays from Rangia cuneata in line with dated samples from the atmospheric radiocarbon reservoir.
Many of these methods, some of them used incorrectly, have tried to force or fit components and assemblages
into Aten's (1983) absolute chronology for the Galveston Bay area, which itself is questioned in this paper.
Suggested methods of correction and calibration are given and are utilized on a sample of extant radiocarbon
assays from the Galveston Bay area.

INTRODUCTION
The lack of appropriate materials from
indisputable contexts for radiocarbon dating
presents a major obstacle for archeological
investigations in the Galveston Bay area.
Commonly, charcoal is not found in discrete hearths
but instead is scattered and dispersed throughout
the site and/or shell midden (Aten et al. 1976: 12;
Gadus and Howard 1990:201). Due to the paucity
and sometimes questionable provenience of
charcoal, archeologists working in the Galveston
Bay area primarily have resorted to obtaining
radiocarbon assays from shells, particularly those
of the ubiquitous brackish water bivalve, Rangia
cuneata. However radiocarbon assays on shells,
including R. cuneata, are inherently problematic
because shells grow and develop outside the
atmospheric carbon reservoir (Molto et al. 1997:495;
Stuiver and Braziunas 1993: 137; Stuiver and Polach
1977; Taylor 1987:49-52) and tend to render
radiocarbon ages that are too old. In the Galveston
Bay area, several factors may account for this.
Valastro and Davis (1970:265-266) estimated that
R. cuneata shells from the Trinity delta area are
diluted with 1-3 percent dead carbon, most likely
from ancient terrestrial carbonates delivered by the
Trinity River. It is also probable that the influx of
marine waters from the Gulf, particularly during

periods of drought and/or prior to the development
of Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula, might
contribute to the age anomaly in shell. This age
anomaly phenomenon is known as the reservoir
effect (Stuiver et al. 1986; Stuiver and Polach 1977).
A reservoir correction factor has to be applied to
these radiocarbon ages in order to bring them in
line with contemporaneous samples grown in the
atmosphere (Molto et al. 1997:495; Taylor 1987:49).
The difference between conventional radiocarbon
ages of samples grown simultaneously in the
atmosphere and another carbon reservoir is known
as the reservoir age, R(t). Differences between
reservoir and atmosphere radiocarbon activity are
apt to vary with changes in reservoir parameters,
changes in atmospheric 14C values, and exchanges
or interaction between reservoirs; therefore, R(t) is
not constant (t =cal age) (Stuiver et al. 1986:980).
Aten (1983:329-341) tried to compensate for
reservoir effect in the Galveston Bay area by deriving a reservoir correction factor (225 Â± 103 years)
based on dated pairs of shell and charcoal. The
pairs, exhumed from common proveniences or
stratigraphic positions within shell middens, were
assumed to be coeval. With a number of radiocarbon assays from paired charcoal and shells, Aten
(1983:332) provided a regression equation in order
to predict charcoal (atmospheric) radiocarbon ages
for contemporaneous R. cuneata shells. With this

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 70 (1999)

458

Texas Archeological Society

regression equation and its standard error, the shell
radiocarbon ages were transformed into a charcoal
radiocarbon scale or brought in line with the atmospheric carbon reservoir. The correction factor was
then applied to the raw radiocarbon ages obtained
from unpaired R. cuneata shells. A correction for
stable carbon isotope fractionation (delta 13 C) was
not applied to the shell radiocarbon ages prior to
the reservoir correction and subsequent calibration.
Based on this work, Aten (1983:282-290) developed a Ceramic period chronology for Galveston
Bay based on a seriation of ceramics from a number of sites, and radiocarbon assays from the various ceramic-bearing components. Six periods were
defined using the relative percentages of two major
ceramic wares: untempered sandy paste wares (e.g.,
Goose Creek Plain) and grog-tempered wares (e.g.,
Baytown Plain). The stratigraphic distribution of
more than 60 radiocarbon dates was then used to
estimate the time range for each of the six periods
(Aten 1983:285). Even though Aten's (1983:283)
ceramic seriation is somewhat problematic given
its heavy reliance on the presence and absence of
Goose Creek Plain, which has a bimodal distribution, it has on a general level held up since its
inception (cf. Ellis and Ellis 1995). However, the
absolute chronology of this sequence has been questioned (e.g., Howard et al. 1991:13; Kibler et al.
1992:21; Weinstein 1986:119-120).
Recent archeological investigations have suggested that the absolute chronology of the Ceramic
period may be inaccurate (see Ricklis 1994). Aten's
radiocarbon dates may be too recent by 150 years
(Kibler et al. 1992:21) to 200-300 years (Howard
et al. 1991:13). At 41GV10 and 41GV53 along
Clear Creek, the radiocarbon dates for the ceramicbearing levels appeared to be several hundred years
older than the ages implied by the associated ceramic assemblages, even after applying Aten's correction factor (Bailey et al. 1987: 16, 20). Weinstein
(1986: 119-120) has argued that an increase in age
of approximately 200 years would bring Tchefuncte
ceramic-bearing components of the Galveston Bay
area (i.e., Clear Lake period) more in line with
dated Tchefuncte components in the lower Mississippi River valley to the east that date to ca. 2450-1950 B.P. Some suggest a time lag between the
introduction of certain early ceramic types into the
Galveston Bay area and their introduction (and in
some cases their disappearance in the archeological
record) to neighboring Louisiana (e.g., Aten 1983).

This explanation is not a strong argument and may
have been bolstered by inappropriate methods of
correction and calibration of radiocarbon ages of
R. cuneata.
Unfortunately, the varying results and interpretations of shell radiocarbon ages have led many
archeologists to use a barrage of varying correction
factors and calibration curves to force their radiocarbon ages into Aten's (1983) absolute chronology. Weinstein et al. (1988:210) applied Aten's
correction factor to delta 13 C-corrected assays and
then calibrated the dates using the dendrochronological curve of Klein et al. (1982). Later, Weinstein
(1991) calibrated delta 13 C-corrected radiocarbon
ages using the Klein et al. (1982) curve, but made
no attempt to correct for reservoir effect in his final
interpretation. Gadus and Howard (1990) applied
Aten's correction factor to uncorrected radiocarbon
ages and then calibrated the assays utilizing the
atmospheric record of Stuiver and Pearson (1986)
and Pearson and Stuiver ( 1986), while Ensor ( 1995)
applied Aten' s correction factor in conjunction with
the marine calibration curve of Stuiver and
Braziunas (1993), or a mixed atmospheric and marine calibration curve to delta 13C-corrected assays.
Howard et al. (1991 :26-27) applied a reservoir correction factor (~R=-5 Â± 15) derived from the world
ocean model of Stuiver et al. (1986) for Carribean
samples to conventional radiocarbon ages, then calibrated them with the marine calibration curve of
Stuiver et al. (1986). In addition, Howard et al.
(1991) calibrated the same conventional radiocarbon ages using the atmospheric curve of Stuiver
and Pearson (1986) and Pearson and Stuiver (1986),
comparing the results with the marine calibrations.
In all cases the atmospheric curve yielded dates
300-500 years older than the marine curve (Howard
et al. 1991:44, 71-72).
There may be various explanations for discrepancies between Aten' s absolute chronology and
more recently obtained radiocarbon ages from
shells, and why there are so many contrasting shell
radiocarbon ages for the various ceramic-bearing
components. First, Aten's original dates were not
corrected for stable carbon isotope fractionation.
Second, the greater accuracy and precision of
today's radiocarbon dating techniques and calibration curves, respectively, should produce more reliable dates than those used for Aten's materials.
Third, intra-bay variability in reservoir ages from
terrestrial carbonate enrichment and marine water

Kibler - Radiocarbon Dating of Rangia cuneata
intrusion across Galveston Bay may be responsible
for some discrepancies (Howard et al. 1991: 13 ).
Aten's reservoir correction factor, which is directly
applicable for the Trinity River delta area, may not
be applicable for other areas of Galveston Bay. For
example, although the Trinity River basin includes
carbonate-rich, Cretaceous-age lithological units,
the Clear Creek drainage basin does not (Aronow
et al. 1982).
The establishment of a more-accurate absolute
chronology is critical for several reasons, from extra-regional comparisons and interactions to
diachronic changes (be they technological, environmental, or social) within the Galveston Bay area
itself. This is particularly important for temporally
establishing the beginning of the Clear Lake period, which marks the first appearance of ceramics
(albeit in low frequencies, although the exception
to this is the Eagle's Ridge site, 41CH252 [see
Ensor 1997]) in the Galveston Bay area. Under
such low-density conditions, the ability to differentiate Clear Lake components from preceding Late
Archaic components at some sites based on the
presence or absence of ceramics may be problematic. Radiocarbon dates for the positive occurrence
of ceramics must be emphasized as the basis for
estimating the initial appearance of ceramics in the
Galveston Bay area (Aten 1983:286).

METHODS OF CORRECTION
AND CALIBRATION
The selection of appropriate radiocarbon correction methods and calibration curves for shell
samples remains a major research issue (Ensor
1997:30; Gadus and Howard 1990:224; Ricklis and
Cox 1991 :23-24). Methods of correction for stable
carbon isotope fractionation, reservoir age, and calibration for radiocarbon assays from R. cuneata are
presented below. These methods follow those used
by Howard et al. (1991), although I have attempted
to calculate and use a more appropriate and more
local reservoir correction factor than that used by
Howard et al. (1991).
First, the radiocarbon assay should be corrected
for stable carbon isotope fractionation, which until
recently was rarely performed. In some
archeological studies of Galveston Bay and other
Texas bays, earlier-obtained radiocarbon assays
without accompanying delta 13 C values were

459

corrected by applying an average value (e.g.,
Howard et al. 1991; Ricklis and Cox 1991; Ricklis
1993). Often this cannot be avoided since the
original sample is usually no longer available for
obtaining such measurements. However, delta 13 C
values tend to vary from specimen to specimen. A
sample of 71 R. cuneata shells from the Galveston
Bay area have yielded delta 13 C values ranging from
-1.6 %0 to -10.8 %0 (mean=-6.4 Â± 1.8 %0), which
increase the ages of the samples by 230 to 375
years (mean=300 years) (see Ensor 1995; Gadus
and Howard 1990; Howard et al. 1991; Kibler et al.
1992; Weinstein 1991; Weinstein et al. 1988;
Weinstein and Whelan 1987). All future
investigations need to obtain delta 13 C values for
each assay in order to correct the raw radiocarbon
age, and while events separated by less than 200 to
300 years are indistinguishable for normal precision
dating (Taylor 1987:141), corrections for stable
carbon isotope fractionation should still be carried
out since the effect of no correction may multiple
once the radiocarbon age is subsequently corrected
for reservoir effect and calibrated. This is
particularly important given the great range (9.2 %0
or greater) of delta 13C values for R. cuneata in the
Galveston Bay area.
Second, a reservoir correction factor needs to
be applied to the delta 13C corrected assay to bring
the shell's conventional radiocarbon age in line with
the atmospheric carbon reservoir. To handle reservoir effect and calculate a correction factor, I follow the method developed by Stuiver et al. ( 1986)
and Stuiver and Braziunas (1993).
A reservoir correction factor for the R. cuneata
of Galveston Bay may be obtained two ways. The
first way is through the acquisition and radiocarbon
dating of shell/charcoal pairs from common proveniences (e.g., Aten 1983). However, the assumption that shell/charcoal pairs are contemporaneous
can be problematic due to our incomplete understanding of shell midden formation processes. Theoretically, charcoal from a particular stratum may be
more recent than the adjacent shells, since charcoal
from a fire built on top of the inherently coarse
matrix of a shell midden may work down into an
earlier stratum (Ambler 1973:47-49; Aten
1983:332). Shell midden surfaces may also have
been exposed for very long periods of time prior to
burial (Aten 1983:332), and therefore subjected to
contact with the material remains (e.g., charcoal) of
much later occupations. While these are potential

460

problems, strong correlation coefficients for Aten's
(1983) pairs (Pearson's r=0.985) and a data set of
pairs (Pearson's r=0.996) presented later in this
paper lend support to the assumption of the
contemporaneity of the individual pairs.
The second method is to obtain a sample of
conventional radiocarbon ages from shells of known
historic age (Molto et al. 1997:496). One important
factor to consider when procuring such a sample is
the introduction of vast amounts of hydrocarbons
into the Galveston Bay environment during the last
80-90 years from the development of the petrochemical, oil, and gas industries. Because of this, it
would be best to obtain samples of R. cuneata that
are known to have been collected prior to the turn
of the century. Samples may have been collected
by naturalists traveling through the Galveston Bay
area in the 19th century. The R. cuneata specimens
must have been collected alive. Such samples currently may be curated at various museums and/or
universities across Texas and the country.
Calculating the reservoir correction factor for
both methods consists of plotting the calibrated
intercept(s) of the radiocarbon-dated charcoal of
the sheU/charcoal pair or the collection date of the
modern shell against the 14 C content of the mixed
layer (top 75 m) of the model ocean formulated by
Stuiver et al. (1986:Figure 11-llS; Stuiver and
Braziunas [1993:Figures 17A-17X]). The model's
14
C content was calculated through observations of
the atmospheric b. 14C record. The model's mixed
layer reservoir age, R(t), averages 373 years over
the last 9,000 years and is the result of specific
model parameters; it does not reflect local variations in the ocean reservoir ages (Stuiver et al.
1986:982). Stuiver and Braziunas (1993:139-140)
have extended the model ocean to ca. 12,000 B.P.
based on Bard et al's. (1993) data set of 234 U/230Th
ages on corals. This has resulted in minor, but negligible corrections to the model. Local variations
are accounted for by b.R.
Simply put, b.R is the difference between the
reservoir age of local reservoirs (e.g., Galveston
Bay) and the reservoir age of the model ocean.
There are two components to b.R that account for
the difference. The first is the differences between
the global and local atmospheric 14C ages, and the
second is the differences between the world model
ocean and local processes, such as fluvial discharge.
By assuming a parallel b. 14 C response between the
model ocean and regional parts of the world ocean,

local variations or effects can be taken into account
and corrected for in the calibration process. In other
words, it is assumed as a first approximation that
the regional (Galveston Bay) and world ocean have
identical time-dependent responses to atmospheric
forcing (Stuiver et al. 1986:982). Thus, although
the difference between radiocarbon ages of samples
formed contemporaneously in the mixed layer of
the ocean and the atmosphere (i.e., the reservoir
age) is time dependent-because the oceanic b. 14C
response to atmospheric d 14 C changes-an approximately parallel response to atmospheric forcing of
a regional part of the ocean and the world ocean
results in a constant difference (b.R) in the reservoir
age of the two. Therefore, although R(t) is not constant, b.R, as a first approximation, is constant
(Stuiver et al. 1986:982; Stuiver and Braziunas
1993:139).
The difference (b.R) in the reservoir age of
Galveston Bay and the reservoir age of Stuiver et
al. (1986) or Stuiver and Braziunas (1993) model
oceans can be derived through the formula, b.R =
P-Q, where P represents the delta 13C-corrected
radiocarbon age of the prehistoric shell of the shell/
charcoal pair or the modern shell. The values for Q
are derived, as described above, from the mixed
layer of the model ocean of Stuiver et al. (l 986:Figures IOA and 11-1 lS) or Stuiver and Braziunas
(1993 :Figures 17A-17X) and presented as radiocarbon years B.P. (Figure 1). Standard deviations
for b.R can be calculated from the errors reported
with the radiocarbon ages of the dated sample.
A group of radiocarbon ages also can be
viewed as a data set from which the standard deviation in the unweighted mean can be calculated
(Stuiver et al. 1986:982). After b.R and its standard
deviation are determined, it can be used in conjunction with the computer calibration program of
Stuiver and Reimer (1986, 1993), and the marine
calibration curve of Stuiver and Braziunas
(1993:137), to acquire a calibrated date range for
any conventional radiocarbon age on R. cuneata
from the Galveston Bay area. The marine calibration curve is used because only it can account for
the time dependency of R(t) (Stuiver and Braziunas
1993: 137). The computer program and calibration
curve have the ability to incorporate any given reservoir correction factor. Little (1993) found the
method and calibration curve appropriate for calibrating the conventional radiocarbon ages of marine shells obtained from archeological sites along

the coast of New England. Little's (1993) investigations revealed a close correlation between the
marine curve-calibrated dates from shell, radiocarbon-dated organic materials of terrestrial origin,
and associated temporally diagnostic artifacts.
While R. cuneata is not a true marine species, it is
clearly not a freshwater species either, tolerating
salinities from 1-15 %0 and surviving in salinities
as high as 25 %0 and as low as 0 %0 at times
(Hopkins et al. 1973). It should be noted that I
"manually" applied the derived Ll.R value to the
conventional radiocarbon ages of the shells (of the
data set presented below) prior to calibration.
These "reservoir-corrected" ages were then calibrated using the atmospheric curve of Stuiver and
Pearson (1993) and Pearson and Stuiver (1993).
The resultant dates did not overlap at one-sigma
with the dates of their charcoal pairs, and most did
not overlap even at two-sigmas. The best correlation was found using the marine calibration curve
of Stuiver and Braziunas (1993).

Radiocarbon Dating of Rangia cuneata

A CASE STUDY OF
THESE METHODS
A small number of conventional radiocarbon
ages from paired R. cuneata shells and charcoal
have been reported from the Peggy Lake sites along
the lower San Jacinto River (Gadus and Howard
1990), and from sites in the Trinity River delta
(Ensor 1995, 1997). From this small extant database, LiR values were derived from each charcoal/
shell pair (Table 1).
Howard et al. (1991: 13) believed that variabilities in terrestrial carbonate enrichment across
Galveston Bay may result in intra-bay reservoir age
variability. To test this hypothesis, mean Li R values from the Peggy Lake sites (average Li R=l40 Â±
34) and the Trinity River sites (average Li R=94 Â±
25) were compared. The results suggest that statistically there is no significant difference between Li
R values from the lower San Jacinto River area and
the Trinity River delta area (t=2.527, df=4, p >0.05).
Simply put, the same reservoir correction factor
can be used to correct conventional shell (R.
cuneata) radiocarbon ages from both areas, and
possibly all of Galveston Bay. It is also probable
that reservoir correction factors may vary through
time, particularly for shells that predate (>ca. 4000
B.P.) and postdate (<ca. 4000 B.P.) the development of the barrier complex of the Gulf entrance to
Galveston Bay. To test this hypothesis, the mean Li
R value derived from the two oldest charcoal/shell
pairs (average A R=238 Â± 42) was compared to the
mean Li R value derived from the remaining nine
pairs (average A R=88 Â± 23). Again the results
suggest there is no significant difference or variation through time (t=4.835, df=l, p > 0.10). Based
on these results, an average L1 R value of 115 Â± 20
was calculated for the data set, and used in conjunction with the marine calibration curve of Stuiver
and Braziunas (1993) to calibrate the conventional
radiocarbon ages of the shell partners in the data set
(see Table 1). The corrected and calibrated twosigma date ranges of the shells closely correlate
and overlap with the two-sigma calibrated dates of
their charcoal mates.
In order to test and evaluate the Li R value ( 115
Â± 20) and Aten's (1983) absolute chronology, select conventional radiocarbon assays on R. cuneata
in association with Clear Lake period (A.D. 100425) ceramic assemblages were corrected for reservoir effect and calibrated as above. The Clear Lake

period is viewed as a good test case because
Tchefuncte wares, which are well dated in Louisiana to ca. 2450-1950 B.P., are included in the
period's ceramic assemblage.
From 41 CH63, along Lake Charlotte,
Weinstein et al. (1989:87) report Tchefuncte Plain
ceramics within a stratified shell midden. At
41HR581 in the Peggy Lake disposal area, Gadus
and Howard (1990: 152, 172) report on the excavation of a small discrete shell pile (Feature 7, which
they interpret as an early Clear Lake feature) associated with five Goose Creek body sherds. Conventional radiocarbon assays of 2732 Â± 67 B.P.
(UGa-5844) and 2510 Â± 90 B.P. (Beta-29979), respectively, were obtained on associated R. cuneata
shells. Corrected for reservoir effect and calibrated,
the radiocarbon ages produce two-sigma date ranges
of 497 (354) 161 B.C. and 331 (48 B.C.) A.D. 149,
respectively. The resultant two-sigma date ranges
from this exercise lend support to the idea that
Aten's (1983) absolute chronology may be 200400 years too recent. More significantly, the dates
are in line chronologically with Tchefuncte ceramicbearing components further to the east.

CONCLUSIONS
The difficulties of radiocarbon dating materials not originating in the atmospheric carbon reservoir are well known (Gillespie and Polach 1979;
Stuiver and Polach 1977; Taylor 1987:49-52).
Molto et al. (1997) provide an excellent account of
the difficulties of dating materials subjected to reservoir effects (in their case, skeletal remains of
humans whose diet consisted of an unknown portion of marine resources). They clearly demonstrate
how a conventional radiocarbon age can render
multiple date ranges of great variability when calibrated with an atmospheric and a mixed atmospheric/marine curve and when such parameters as
!::.. R and the amount of marine carbon in the
paleodiet are unknown (Ensor [1997] provides a
similar discussion on R. cuneata radiocarbon ages).
In demonstrating this variability, Molto et al. (1997)
did not come to any firm conclusions regarding
correction factors (for reservoir effect) for their
materials, nor does this article claim to be the last
word on the correction for reservoir effect for radiocarbon ages of R. cuneata from the Galveston
Bay area. The!::.. R value (115 Â± 20) presented here

is considered preliminary and it may not be applicable for all areas of Galveston Bay (e.g., Clear
Lake). It is statistical in nature and is bound to be
slightly adjusted as more appropriate data are acquired. Obviously, more pairs must be dated from
various areas across Galveston Bay in order to calculate a more-robust reservoir correction factor(s).
Such a factor(s) should be supported by additional
!::.. R values derived through the radiocarbon dating
of modem or historically collected R. cuneata specimens. Similar steps should be taken for the other
bays and estuaries along the Texas Coast, since
there may be some interbay variability. If possible,
more of the materials originally dated by Aten
(1983) should be obtained, dated again by radiocarbon assay, corrected for stable carbon isotope fractionation, and then calibrated with the reservoir
correction factor so that comparisons can be made
with the calculations made by Aten (1983). It is
believed that these steps will result in more reliable
radiocarbon dates from unpaired R. cuneata, which
are more common archeologically and more often
in less-questionable contexts than charcoal. Accurately dating archeological R. cuneata remains will
thus strengthen and create a more rigorous absolute
chronology for the Galveston Bay area, and comparisons can be more readily made with similar
components and assemblages throughout and outside of the Galveston Bay area.

Comparative Review and Discussion of Rangia cuneata
Dating Methods on the Upper Texas Coast

H. Blaine Ensor

ABSTRACT

A summary of Rangia cuneata dating methods is presented based on recent research in the W allisville Lake
project area and Galveston/Trinity Bay system. After presenting a general history of Rangia cuneata dating,
three Rangia dating methods are presented that have been recently used by various researchers at sites in the
Galveston!frinity Bay system. It is concluded that a terrestrial or atmospheric model using a reservoir correction
factor seems most appropriate with regard to dating brackish water clams on the upper Texas Coast.

INTRODUCTION
The issue of accurately dating shell on the
upper Texas coast is an important one because of
the dearth of reliable charcoal samples from archeological sites in the Galveston Bay and upper
Texas coast region. This discussion presents current views on how dating of Rangia cuneata and
other shells from archeological sites in the vicinity
of Galveston Bay and the upper Texas coast should
be handled, given the current state of knowledge.
The following discussion attempts to draw divergent approaches together for comparative purposes
and to illustrate apparent strengths and weaknesses
of each method. In the end, no one approach is
likely to be a "cure all" for dating shell in the area
due to problems inherent in dating shell in general.
What follows is an attempt to present the current evidence on dating shell in the area, to compare the competing methodologies, and to arrive at
an unbiased set of conclusions that may benefit
future researchers who must deal with this issue.
While it may not be possible to eliminate all bias
from the discussion, the reader is assured that a fair
and reasoned approach has been taken which displays similarities and differences in the methods,
including supporting arguments with actual data
presented as clearly as possible. The reader is left
to judge the success or failure of this endeavor.

RANGIA CUNEATA DATING ON
THE UPPER TEXAS COAST
Radiocarbon dating of the marsh clam, Rangia
cuneata, on the upper Texas coast and in the
Galveston Bay area was first given serious discourse by J. Richard Ambler, working in conjunction with Sam Valastro of The University of Texas
at Austin Radiocarbon Laboratory in the early 1970s
(cf. Aten 1983:330). At that time, a discrepancy
was detected between the age of Rangia cuneata
and charcoal found in apparent association. A series of "paired" charcoaVshell samples was run on
samples from the Trinity River delta. These assays
revealed that the shell ranged from 100 years to
400 years older than the charcoal from the same
context. The difference in age was attributed to the
1-3 percent "dead" carbon that had somehow managed to find its way into the shell calcium carbonate structure.
As part of his dissertation research, Lawrence
Aten conducted a lengthy review of the problems
of shell dating on the upper Texas coast. Since
Ambler and Valastro had made a plausible case for
a consistent difference between the ages of the shell
and charcoal components in the paired samples,
Aten felt compelled to explore the matter further as
part of his dissertation research. As stated by Aten
(1983:329):

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 70 (1999)

468

Texas Archeological Society
It is reasonable to estimate that at least

90% of the archaeological shell middens
on the upper Texas coast are composed
entirely ... of the brackish water clam,
Rangia cuneata. To develop understanding of Rangia cuneata as a practical radiocarbon dating tool would constitute
an important technical improvement
supporting archaeological research in
this area. But the practical use of any
medium for radiocarbon age determinations depends on an understanding of
carbon isotope behavior in that medium
and the field conditions in which these
materials occur.
Aten, like Ambler, recognized the potential
problems associated with dating shell from the
Galveston Bay area, since various carbon reservoirs could significantly alter shell carbonate material through carbonate exchange in an aqueous
medium (Aten 1983:330). Aten decided to continue the work of Ambler by collecting paired
samples from sites in the Galveston Bay area whenever possible. These samples formed the empirical
basis for his regression equation which predicted
the shell age from the charcoal age. A Pearson
correlation coefficient of R=.985 was obtained between the ages of the 13 paired charcoal and Rangia
cuneata samples (Aten 1983:333-334; Howard
1991: 12). A regression equation was developed that
allowed for the conversion of Rangia cuneata dates
to the charcoal radiocarbon scale (Aten 1983:334).
Aten's (1983:334) formula was based on the results
of the regression analysis:
y = 0.995x-225.244 l, SEEY = 103 years
where y = the predicted shell radiocarbon age after
transformation to a charcoal scale, in radiocarbon
years B.P.; x = the apparent or assayed age of
Rangia cuneata shell, in radiocarbon years B.P.;
and SEEY = standard error of the estimate of the
regression equation, in radiocarbon years. This estimate is based on the sampling distribution of the
individual radiocarbon sample means and replaced
the use of sample standard deviations for corrected
age estimates.
At the time that Aten's shell dates were run at
The University of Texas at Austin Radiocarbon
Laboratory, correction for isotopic fractionation
was generally not conducted, so all of Aten' s work

was performed using the "raw" or, in today's
terminology, measured 14 C age. The dates were
further tree-ring calibrated according to Seuss
(1970), since it was recognized that the amount of
14
C in the atmosphere had varied over time.
In addition to developing the 225-year correction factor for archeological shells in the Galveston
Bay area, Aten also gathered information on dating
shells along the entirety of the upper Texas coast
into southwestern Louisiana. Aten noted that while
paired charcoal/shell samples are not common from
southwestern Louisiana to the lower Lavaca River
area, water chemistry data indicate that bicarbonate
concentrations range from a low of 37.5 mg/liter in
the Sabine River drainage to a high of 269 mg/liter
in the lower Lavaca River area. The Trinity River
had a concentration of 113.6 mg/liter while the
Brazos River delta had a concentration of 139 mg/
liter. Aten noted a correlation between the bicarbonate level and estimated differences between
shell/charcoal pairs from these areas, suggesting
that bicarbonates from interior limestone rock formations have played a role in determining 13 C/ 12C
ratios of shell dates on the upper Texas coast (Aten
1983:338-339).
Radiocarbon dating since Aten' s work in the
Galveston Bay area and along the upper Texas coast
has acknowledged Aten' s work to a greater or lesser
degree (Ensor 1995; Gadus and Howard 1990;
Howard et al. 1991; Kibler 1996; Ricklis 1994,
1995; Weinstein and Whelan 1987; Weinstein 1991,
1994), yet a general feeling of uneasiness with the
results of radiocarbon dating shell and the general
lack of charcoal samples from secure contexts have
been worrisome (Ensor 1995; Gadus and Howard
1990; Howard et al. 1991; Kibler 1996). Howard
(Howard et al. 1991:12-13) conducted a review of
14
C dating prior to dating samples in the Clear
Creek area of Galveston Bay. Howard discusses
many of the potential pitfalls associated with dating
Rangia cuneata on the upper Texas coast, including the fractionation or 13 C/ 12 C ratio. As explained
by Howard (Howard et al. 1991:12-13):
Fractionation is the variation in the ratios of the carbon isotopes between organisms, as a function of the isotopes'
differing atomic masses. The amount of
enrichment or depletion of the "heavier"
14
C isotope in a sample may be compensated for by normalizing its activity to

Ensor -

Comparative Review and Discussion of Rangia cuneata Dating Methods

the ratio of the stable carbon isotopes
13 C/ 12C. Conventional 14C assays assume a given concentration of 12C in the
sample. If this concentration, as measured by the delta 13C value, varies from
the standard delta 13C value of charcoal
(-25.0 %0) the radiocarbon age calculations must be adjusted accordingly.
To illustrate the significant variation in the
ratios of charcoal and shell samples from
the Galveston Bay area, Howard noted that 10
charcoal dates from sites at Peggy Lake yielded
only a slight variation from the standard delta 13 C
value of -25.0 %0, with 13 C/ 12C values ranging
from -22.8 to -27.7 %0; this results in corrections
of only 40 years or less (Howard et al. 1991:13).
On the other hand, assays of 23 shells from Peggy
Lake sites indicated that 13 C/ 12C ratios ranged from
-1.6 to -8.4 %0, which adds anywhere from 270 to
390 years (average of 317 Â± 31) to their age when
normalized to the standard 13 C/12C value. Further,
dates from shells at Clear Creek sites yielded similar increases in age since 13 C/ 12C values ranged
from -2.7 to -6.8 %0. This indicated that the shells,
when corrected for fractionation, yielded dates some
290 to 370 years older (average of 326 Â± 24).
Howard also noted that these age differences compared favorably to results obtained from dating similar material from other places in the world (Howard
et al.1991: 13).
In her review, Howard also discussed the impact of carbonates that originate in the deep oceans
and in freshwater reservoirs. Translocation of carbonates from limestone or calcium-rich ocean bottoms or the influx of carbonate-rich water into
Galveston Bay have been considered the primary
sources of a local "reservoir effect" that causes the
differences between shell and charcoal ages in the
Galveston Bay area. However, the degree of magnitude and source (freshwater or marine, or a combination of the two) are unknown since it is
difficult to measure this phenomena (Howard et al.
1991: 13). Howard further stated that the correction
factor derived by Aten (1983) is probably correct.
However, she qualified this with the statement that
the dates are probably too young by 200-300 years
since 13 C/ 12C correction for fractionation was not
conducted for Aten's samples and the context of
the charcoal portion of the paired sample was less
than certain. She indicated that because of all the
13 C/ 12C

469

uncertainties involving reservoir effects and fractionation, the dates that she obtained that had been
corrected for fractionation were not directly comparable to Aten' s assays. Howard et al. (1991 :7073) corrected the measured or "raw" 14C ages of
the Clear Lake samples for fractionation and then
calibrated them using the conventional ages with
both the terrestrial and marine models in CALIB
(Stuiver and Reimer 1986). The marine-calibrated
conventional ages ranged from 200-500 years
younger than those calibrated with the terrestrial
model. A delta R value of -5 Â± 15 was used in the
marine calibration, which approximates values derived from the world ocean model of Stuiver and
Reimer ( 1986) for the Caribbean, the closest ocean
with available delta R values. It was noted that any
reservoir variability related to freshwater carbonate was not taken into account using the marine
model (Bailey et al. 1991:26-27).
With this background, the various methods that
have been proposed for adjusting or calibrating shell
ages to bring them in line with conventional charcoal ages are discussed below. It should be noted
that all calibrations presented have been produced
using CALIB (version 3.0 or higher) or the PretoriaBeta program currently in use by Beta Analytic,
Inc. The results produced by both programs are
statistically the same with the Beta-Pretoria program employing a cubic spline fit of the calibration
data that smooths the correlation curve, effectively
averaging the data and making it more representative of individual samples (Darden Hood, 1997 personal communication). In all instances, the program
used is identified and the derivation of calculations
or methods made explicit.
In summary, the uncertainties involved with
dating shell in the Galveston Bay area and along
the upper Texas coast are reinforced by the diverse
range of opinions, each apparently supported by
somewhat independent lines of data, and involving
the use of three different calibration methods. Prior
to delving into calendar calibrations, conventional
versus measured 14C ages, and delta R reservoir
correction factors, a word to the wise is presented
regarding the inherent limitations of radiocarbon
dating and calendar calibrations. The following cautionary note has been provided by Darden Hood
(1997 personal communication) of Beta Analytic,
Inc., and it behooves all with an interest in radiocarbon dating on the upper Texas coast to take
careful note:

470

Texas Archeological Society
... calendar calibration is full of indeterminate errors and all correlation results
should be interpreted loosely and
critically ... they are not a panacea. What
works at one site may be completely different for another site ... or material. Don't
overemphasize the accuracy of calendar
calibrations.

TERRESTRIAL OR ATMOSPHERIC
MODEL WITHOUT A RESERVOIR
CORRECTION
The first model discussed is a simple calibration of shell ages using the terrestrial or atmospheric model (Stuiver and Reimer 1993), also
used for calibrating all charcoal samples. Once
corrected for isotopic fractionation, the age of the
shell is calibrated using Stuiver and Reimer's
(1993) atmospheric model with no reservoir correction. Ricklis (1994, 1995, this volume) indicates
that results of dating paired samples from the Corpus Christ area site 41SP120 (Ricklis 1993; Ricklis
and Cox 1991) and at the Mitchell's Ridge site
(41GV66) on Galveston Island "produced statistically identical results" and "the same ages as
samples of hearth charcoal," respectively. Ricklis
( 1995: 163) further explains his rationale for use of
the atmospheric model when dating shells from the
upper Texas coast:
Judging from the recently acquired empirical evidence, a marine correction factor should not be used on shallow-water
estuarine shells from the Texas coast,
presumably because the relevant molluscan species live in very shallow water in
an essentially atmospheric carbon reservoir, and are not exposed to upwelling of
old organic carbons from the ocean floor,
as occurs in true marine environments.
Additionally, apparent close agreement between
shell ages and cultural components (diagnostic artifacts) at the Lido Harbor site (Weinstein 1991)
were obtained by calibrating the shells using the
atmospheric model and no correction factor. Ricklis
(1995: 163) also states that the dating of paired charcoal/shell samples has inherent pitfalls since charcoal is usually found only in small pieces and the
potential for these pieces to "migrate" downward in

a shell midden is always present. Ricklis notes that
the discrepancy in age between Aten's, and for that
matter any, paired samples may be the product of
such downward migration, the result of a hearth
being built on previously deposited shell and gradually working its way into the underlying shell layer,
where it is found and collected as a paired sample.
The potential liabilities involved with dating such
samples were noted very early in the history of
Rangia cuneata dating in the Galveston Bay area
by Ambler (1973), Aten (1983), and more recently
by Howard et al. (1991), Ensor (1995), and Kibler
(1996). However, the consistent divergence in age
between shell/charcoal pairs has prompted several
recent researchers to re-evaluate and build on Aten' s
concept of a reservoir correction factor (Ensor 1995,
1998; Howard 1991; Kibler 1996).
The results of calibrating nine paired samples
from sites in the Trinity River delta and Galveston
Bay area using the atmospheric model with no reservoir correction are presented below. The results
will be directly compared to the other two methods,
also discussed in detail below. Unlike the samples
calibrated using a reservoir correction factor with
either the atmospheric or marine curve, samples
that were not reservoir-corrected did not overlap
with the charcoal intercepts.

TERRESTRIAL OR ATMOSPHERIC
MODEL USING A RESERVOIR
CORRECTION
The majority of archeological shells in the
Galveston Bay area appear to come from a lacustrine or mixed marine/freshwater environment
(hence the preponderance of the mixed [brackish
water] species Rangia cuneata). A consistent divergence in age ranges for paired charcoal/shell
samples from four sites in the Trinity River delta
has been noticed, and Stuiver et al.'s (1986) atmospheric model has been used recently in conjunction with an updated version of Aten's (1983)
225-year reservoir correction factor (Ensor 1995)
to derive a new delta R correction factor. This new
factor is based on re-dating three paired samples
from 41CH16 in the Trinity River delta (which
had been originally dated by Aten) along with a
paired sample from another Trinity delta site,
41 CH357. Three additional paired samples from
the Eagle's Ridge site (41 CH252), which overlooks

Ensor- Comparative Review and Discussion of Rangia cuneata Dating Methods
the Trinity River delta (Ensor 1995, 1998), have
also been dated. An updated delta R value of 540
Â± 110 years was obtained from 10 of Aten's 13
original paired samples (see Aten 1983:333). These
samples all came from sites in the Trinity River
delta and from general excavation levels where
charcoal was found intermixed with Rangia
cuneata; none came from direct association within
closed or sealed contexts such as pits or hearths.
The value of 540 Â± 110 is subtracted from the conventional radiocarbon age rather than subtracting
Aten' s 225 years, which was applied to the measured or "raw" age of shell (see discussion above).
It is important to note that the local reservoir effect or delta R is equal to the error in 14C age due
to its disequilibrium between the 14C uptake reservoir and the contemporaneous environment. It is
applied only after 13 C/ 12C correction and is discussed relative to the conventional age (Darden
Hood, 1995 personal communication).
The dating of these paired samples has been
discussed in detail by Ensor (1995). Since Aten's
correction factor had been based on shells uncorrected for fractionation, a method was devised to
essentially leave Aten' s correction factor intact, but
to make it usable on samples that have been corrected for fractionation. This was done to avoid
the possibility that someone would use Aten's 225year correction factor (based on measured ages)
on conventional ages. This concept is very simple:
it simply adjusts Aten's 225-year reservoir correction factor systematically so that it can be used on
conventional ages. Regardless of whether one uses
Aten' s original 225 years on a measured (raw) age
or the 540 years on a conventional age (corrected
for fractionation), the results are the same as illustrated by Hood (1997 personal communication):
If measured age=4000 B.P., then the

Measured Age-Aten's 225 years=3775
B.P. (reservoir-corrected 14C age);
If measured age=4000 B.P. and if 13 C/
12C ratio=-6 %0, then the Conventional

age=4310 B.P.;
New reservoir correction for use with the
conventional 14C age=Aten's 225 years
(the difference between the measured and
conventional 14C ages)+ 310 years= 535
(rounded to 540);

471

Conventional 14 C age corrected for
reservoir effect=4310-540=3770 B.P.
(same as reservoir-corrected age).
The outcome is the same in both instances.
The derivation of the 540 Â± 110 year delta R
correction factor involves adding 300 years (which
is equivalent to a 13 C/ 12 C ratio of-6.7 %0) to each of
Aten's 10 shell dates (to correct for fractionation)
and then subtracting the associated (paired) charcoal dates. The 300-year correction factor for Aten' s
measured ages was obtained by using an arbitrary
average of -6.7 %0, since no sample-specific 13 C/
12 C ratios were computed (Darden Hood, 1997 personal communication). The average delta R for the
41CHI6 and 41 CH357 samples was -7.4 %0 or 290
years. When corrected for 13 C/ 12C fractionation and
the charcoal dates are subtracted, an average of 540
years was obtained for Aten' s 10 pairs. When the
average 300 year correction for fractionation is subtracted from the average difference, the result is
315 years, very close to the 300 years assumed for
Aten's uncorrected dates. Aten's charcoal/shell pairs
came from general stratigraphic associations (none
were from discrete hearth areas) and are subject to
the vagaries of post-depositional mixing to one degree or another. Although the difference between
the charcoal and shell dates ranges from 400 to 710
years, or some 310 years, they may be the same
statistically.
As noted by Darden Hood ( 1997 personal communication) regarding the derivation of an assumed
delta R of 540 years for Aten's paired samples:
... with regards to using an assumed 13 C
ratio or -6. The error generated by using
an estimated 13C/12C ratio of -6 on a
sample which really had a ratio of -1
would introduce an 80 year offset. The
standard deviation on a typical radiocarbon date is going to be 60-90 years. So,
although systematically wrong, the precision limitations of radiocarbon dating
itself would not allow you to see this.
AND ... trying to interpret radiocarbon
dates as differentiated within this small
time segment would be incorrect. The
method is just not that good. Now, when
you take all the uncertainties associated
with reservoir correction into account the
offset is even less significant. This is not
a point of debate .. .it is just the way it

472

Texas Archeological Society
is ... However, if it is felt that this is an
important point, I would simply increase
the error on the 540. I thinkÂ± 110 was
used ... make itÂ± 180 orÂ± 200. This would
certainly take it into account.

Keeping this in mind, the three charcoal/shell pairs
dated from 41CH16 show a slightly lower reservoir
effect than that obtained from Aten' s 10 pairs (400
years versus 540 years) (Table 1). Likewise, the
paired sample from 41CH357 also shows a lower
reservoir effect (320 years) than Aten's 540 years.
These differences may be due to site location and
varying concentrations of carbonates. These slightly
lower effects were used below in the calibration of
the 41CH16 shell samples using the atmospheric
model (see Table 1).
All of the samples dated by Ensor ( 1995) from
41CH16 came from general matrix samples from
individual levels. No tight associations such as
would be expected in a feature context were noted.
The paired sample from 41CH357 came from a
well-defined, relatively thin, organic lens or stratum in the lower portion of the shell midden. The
samples from Peggy Lake (sites 41HR581 and
41HR124) (see Table 1) were from individual
strata within shell middens but none were from
discrete hearth areas or pits. The shell member of
the paired sample from Eagle's Ridge (see Table
1) came directly from Feature 2, a diffuse hearth,
while the charcoal member consisted of small charcoal fragments dispersed in the general vicinity of
the hearth. In general, the context of paired samples
consisted of shell/charcoal found intermixed in
general excavation levels of shell middens, with a
few exceptions.
This updated reservoir correction factor,
modified slightly at times to accommodate small
differences in reservoir effect as described
above, has been used in calibrating shell/charcoal pairs from sites 41CH16, 41CH252, and
41 CH357 in the Trinity River delta (Ensor 1995)
and from Peggy Lake sites 41HR124 and
41HR58 l (Gadus and Howard 1990; Kibler
1996). Examination of Table 1 indicates close
correspondence between the calibrated one-sigma
shell intercepts and the charcoal intercept using
the atmospheric model and a delta R correction.
All pairs overlap at one-sigma, with many of the
ages being virtually identical.
The logic of using the atmospheric model in
calibrating shells from the Trinity River delta has

been summarized by Darden Hood ( 1997 personal
communication):
... regarding reservoir correction of shells
using atmospheric data and a local reservoir effect. If there is no reservoir effect,
using the atmospheric calibration curve
is going to give the best estimate of a
calendar equivalent age (since the co2 in
the water is derived directly from the
atmosphere). The best case scenario is
shallow water shells in agitated environments. If a local reservoir is present, simply applying it to the atmospheric data is
the only option since modeling would be
unique to each environment and probably end up with statistically similar numbers as that straight comparison.

MARINE MODEL USING A
RESERVOIR CORRECTION
In a recent study and review of shell dating
methods in the Galveston Bay area, Kibler (this
volume) presents an argument for the use of Stui ver
and Braziunas' (1993) marine model in calibrating
shell samples. By dating paired charcoal/shell
samples from the same context or by obtaining
dates on shells of known historic age, Kibler (1997
personal communication) indicates that a reservoir
correction factor may be obtained in conjunction
with Stuiver et al.'s (1986) mixed layer ocean model
(Figure 1):
To calculate Delta R take the calibrated
intercept (or if there are multiple intercepts average them) of the charcoal at the
point where the calibrated intercept of
the charcoal meets the curve, locate the
corresponding radiocarbon age (in years
BP) along the y-axis of the table. Then
subtract the radiocarbon age that you derived from the table from the conventional radiocarbon age of the shell of the
same pair, this is Delta R, i.e., Delta
R=conventional shell age (BP)-radiocarbon age (BP) derived from its charcoal
mate and model ocean table.
What Kibler' s method actually represents is best
explained by Darden Hood (1997 personal
communication):

When you use the marine calibration
scenario and enter in a local reservoir
effect, you are first adjusting the Conventional 14C age by the amount of the
reservoir correction and then comparing this adjusted age to the marine correlation curve ... this curve is much
smoother than the atmospheric curve.
This is because the curve is mathematically derived from the atmospheric
curve allowing for delay-and-dampening of 14C concentration caused by
equilibration factors. The marine curve
also has a built in global reservoir factor which ranges between about 200 to
500 years dependent on where you are
in the time scale and which has been
mathematically derived through modeling marine ocean circulation and 14C
distribution. Therefore, when you use
this marine curve, you are adding your
local reservoir factor to a global marine
estimate. This is really 2 reservoir effects being added together. It's my impression that these sites aren't
associated closely enough with the marine environment to justify this. If they
are, then some of the effects included
in the marine calibration model are
present and unfortunately non-quantifiable. If they are not, the marine calculation scenario is inappropriate.

Figure 1. 41CH257: Beta-72723 charcoal intercept=A.D. 1170;
delta R for Beta-72726=-60 Â± 50; conventional shell age= 1200 Â±
50; 1200-1260=delta R (adapted from Stuiver and Braziunas
1993; Kibler, 1997 personal communication)

Kibler applies this method to the same paired
samples listed above (see Table 1). Kibler arrived
at an average delta R based on the conventional age
(not corrected for reservoir effect), which resulted
in a substantial difference at 23 Â± 30 years. He also
arrived at a delta R correction factor of 300 years
for the one Rangia sample (Beta-72711) from the
lower portion of the shell midden at 41 CH252
(Kibler, 1997 personal communication).
Each shell sample from the Galveston Bay/
Trinity River delta sites in Table 1 has been
recalibrated (original calibrations were presented in
Kibler [1996:60-61]) using the marine model curve
in CALIB 3.0.3c. Sample-specific delta R correction factors were averaged for different geographic
areas within the Trinity delta/Galveston Bay system. The averages were then used to calibrate the
conventional shell ages of the pairs following
Kibler' s method and delta R factors. Regardless of

which delta R factor was used in his calibrations,
the calibrated one-sigma results overlap with those
from the respective charcoal members in all cases
(Kibler 1996:62, 1997 personal communication).
Although the results are consistent, it is felt that
Kibler' s method unnecessarily uses the marine
model to arrive at a number (his delta R factor) that
will always produce the same results for any charcoal/shell pair; that is, the conventional charcoal
date will always match the conventional shell date,
with the only variance being the actual measured
ages of the charcoal/shell members.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The preceding discussion has attempted to
provide a critical review and comparison of the
different approaches to shell dating in the Galveston

Ensor - Comparative Review and Discussion of Rangia cuneata Dating Methods
Bay and upper Texas coast region. By focusing on
methodology and presenting a wide range of
viewpoints, in conjunction with using paired
charcoal/shell samples to illustrate similarities and
differences in the various approaches, it is hoped
that a clearer understanding of the issues involved
has been achieved.
It appears that both the atmospheric model
using a delta R reservoir correction factor and the
marine model using a reservoir correction factor
yield good results when evaluating the shell/
charcoal pairs (Table 2). However, the reason why
they yield good results is very different. The
atmospheric model using no reservoir correction
yields significantly different ages between the shell/
charcoal pairs (see Table 2). Discounting the
possibility that these differences are due to mixing
or displacement of the charcoal member of the pair,
using the atmospheric model without a delta R
correction factor on archeological shell in the Trinity
delta would appear to give erroneous results. On
the other hand, if significant displacement and
translocation of charcoal has occurred at a site, the
significant overlap obtained by dating the paired
samples may be spurious and unrelated to any
systematic difference in the actual age between the
shell and charcoal. This is the only plausible
explanation for the discrepancy in age. The
apparently consistent results obtained using the
atmospheric model with no reservoir correction
factor at certain sites along the upper Texas coast
may have more to do with their geographical/
environmental location than with factors
contributing to site mixing. Reservoir effects may
vary widely, requiring that each site and locality be
evaluated on an individual basis. It cannot be
assumed that what works at one site will also work
at another.
The main difference between the methods advocated by Ensor and Hood (atmospheric model
with reservoir correction) and Kibler (marine model
with delta R correction) is that the former is empirically derived (i.e., by direct comparison of dates
from shell/charcoal pairs) and calibrated using the
atmospheric model, while the latter is derived, in
part, from a theoretical computer model devised to
calibrate marine samples (see Table 2 and Figure
1). Since the Ensor/Hood model is based strictly on
"empirical" data (original method proposed by
Aten), it appears to be correcting for old carbonates
that most likely have a terrestrial or freshwater ori-

475

gin (i.e., dependent upon a clam bed's location
relative to the source of freshwater carbonates) as
originally envisioned by Aten.
When Kibler uses his marine model on paired
samples he always gets a close correspondence between the shell/charcoal members of a pair because
the same two variables (conventional shell age and
conventional charcoal age of the paired sample) are
used to calculate the delta R vis-a-vis Stuiver and
Braziunas' (1993) marine curve (see Figure 1). Any
delta R calculated from shell/charcoal pairs in this
manner (i.e., conventional shell age minus the corresponding value from the mixed layer of the model
ocean of Stuiver et al. [1986] of the charcoal intercept) will always give identical results. That is to
say, the calibrated charcoal intercept will always
match the marine model calibration for a given pair
since the two .are intrinsically linked by the same
variables. It is not possible to derive a true delta R
factor using this approach since the relationship
between the charcoal/shell ages and the delta R are
predetermined and mathematically defined. The
only things that vary are the values for the variables. Since nature is not that predictable, the number derived by Kibler (his delta R) does not convey
an empirical relationship between the charcoal and
shell pairs. Certainly the variability in radiocarbon
isotopes contained within a charcoal sample, or the
amount of "old carbon" in a shell, will vary enough
in nature to preclude use of this number as a true
delta R factor. Further, any standard deviation associated with a delta R factor must be taken into
account before applying the derived number in a
meaningful manner. A standard deviation of Â± 50
computed using Kibler' s method would yield a delta
R of 0 since the difference in true age between the
charcoal sample and shell sample is statistically
insignificant (Darden Hood, 1997 personal communication).
The main problem with the method, beyond its
use as a predetermined, rigid number that substitutes
for a delta R factor, is that it mistakenly accounts
for the difference in age of charcoal and shell pairs
by attributing them primarily to marine origin
(hence use of the marine curve). If Kibler (this
volume) is not attributing the differences between
the charcoal and shell ages to marine factors, then it
would seem to make better sense to use the
atmospheric model since calculation of his delta R
factor for paired samples is more cumbersome than
the Ensor/Hood method. Kibler's method requires

careful manual calculation of intercepts on Stuiver
and Braziunas' charts and additional steps in
arithmetic to arrive at his delta R factor prior to
entering it into the marine model of CALIB.
The Ensor/Hood method (derived from Aten's
method) requires only subtracting the 540 years (or
a locally derived correction factor based on shell/
charcoal pairs) from the conventional charcoal age
prior to calibration using the atmospheric model
(where no paired samples are present). In samples
where a slightly lesser or greater reservoir effect is
apparent (for paired samples), such as that noted at
41CH357 and 41CH16, one needs to only subtract
the charcoal age from the conventional shell age of
a pair prior to subtracting that result from the
conventional shell age. In either case, the
appropriate reservoir correction factor is subtracted
from the conventional shell age to arrive at the
reservoir-corrected 13 C/ 12C age, which is used as
input into the atmospheric model of the CALIB
program. This method provides a means of arriving
at delta R correction factors for particular areas
within the Trinity delta-Galveston Bay system by
dating paired samples from specific sites or by
dating paired samples from different cultural
components at a site. Once enough paired samples
have been dated for a particular area or time period,
it may be possible, as the data warrants, to date
shells reliably without a charcoal mate for different
areas of the upper Texas coast or for particular
cultural components.
The evidence reviewed above indicates that
although the marine model yields predictably good
(yet artificial) results when used with shell/charcoal
pairs, and provides a method for assigning
conventional shell ages to the marine-adjusted
charcoal scale, it probably should not be used. Since
the shallow waters of Galveston Bay and other
estuaries on the upper Texas coast are subject to
strong agitation and mixing of atmospheric,
freshwater, and perhaps some marine carbon, the
atmospheric method should be used in calibrations.
Since the Ensor/Hood method uses a model that
most closely approximates the environment where
Rangia cuneata grow on the upper Texas coast, and
provides an accurate means of transforming shell
dates into the charcoal scale using a more
appropriate model, it would seem preferable to the
marine model.
Future studies should focus on obtaining
additional charcoal/shell "pairs" from discrete

477

contexts in the Galveston Bay and upper Texas
coast region that can be used to "fine-tune" the
existing data. The limitations of radiocarbon dating
must be studied and recognized and a concerted
effort made to "date within our means." As much
as we would like to have narrow, tight chronologies,
it is always safer to err on the side of reason and
interpret the age of material remains carefully and
conservatively. In conclusion, in searching for the
most appropriate calibration method and accurate
shell date possible on the upper Texas coast,
researchers must always be cognizant of the inherent
limitation of calibration methods as they exist. An
open mind should be maintained, and revision,
addition, or correction to established methods
implemented as new data become available. All
methods of calibration and derivation of correction
factors (with specific examples provided) should
be included for each analysis. In this manner,
confusion and uncertainty related to shell dating
can be minimized and the archeological results
achieved more meaningful.

Atmospheric Calibration of Radiocarbon Ages
on Shallow-Water Estuarine Shells from Texas
Coast Sites and the Problem of Questionable
Shell-Charcoal Pairing

Robert A. Ricklis

ABSTRACT
The use of a marine-reservoir calibration or a so-called freshwater correction factor on conventional
radiocarbon ages of archeological shell samples from the Texas coast may produce misleading results. Given
the arithmetical inevitability that the delta-R factor in marine calibration will automatically bring any shell
age into alignment with that on terrestrial wood charcoal, it is essential to show clear association of paired
shell-charcoal samples on the basis of co-occurrence within discrete depositional units in which the
contemporaneity of shell and charcoal can be confidently demonstrated. Only in this way can it be
determined that divergences in conventional radiocarbon ages are the result of the influence of a marine
carbon reservoir, rather than a reflection of actual age differences between shell and charcoal samples. Where
paired samples have been extracted from discrete depositional units at Texas coast sites, the conventional or
uncalibrated ages on paired shell and charcoal samples are similar or virtually identical, strongly suggesting
that shallow-water mollusks in protected estuaries grew in an essentially atmospheric, rather than a marine,
environment. In these cases, an atmospheric, rather than marine, calibration is appropriate. In light of these
findings, the assumption that either a marine calibration or a "freshwater" correction factor (which rests on
untested assumptions) should be employed on conventional shell dates from Texas coast sites is questionable. Future research should, therefore, seek to expand the relevant data base through acquisition of
additional, clearly paired shell-charcoal samples.

MARINE CALIBRATION AND
FRESHWATER CORRECTIONS
OF CONVENTIONAL SHELL AGES
It has been recognized for some time that
radiocarbon ages on marine shells from archeological sites are often several hundred years older
than ages on apparently associated charcoal.
Additionally, it has been noted that marine shells of
known historic ages also tend to be produce
radiocarbon ages somewhat older than the recorded
date of gathering (Stuiver et al. 1986; Taylor 1987;
Stuiver and Braziunas 1993). Theoretically, the
divergent ages have been explained as due to the
reduced intake of atmospheric 14C by marine
organisms, and also perhaps due to the presence of
"old" carbon introduced into the subaqueous
environment through oceanic upwelling of organic

materials. In order to compensate for age differences
between dated materials of terrestrial vs. marine
origins, a marine calibration curve was developed
for adjusting conventional radiocarbon ages on shell
samples (Stuiver et al. 1986; Stuiver and Braziunas
1993).
To employ the marine calibration curve, the
following procedures are required:
1. The delta-R must be calculated. The delta-R
is obtained by the formula delta-R=P-Q, where
Pis the conventional radiocarbon age on shell
(raw radiocarbon age corrected for 13C) and Q
is the actual age of the sample (as measured
by the atmospherically calibrated age of associated charcoal or the known age of a historically collected shell sample) as adjusted by
reference to a mixed marine layer calibration

curve (Stuiver et al. 1986; Stuiver and
Braziunas 1993; see also Kibler et al. 1996
and Kibler, this volume).

2. The conventional age of the shell sample (raw
radiocarbon age plus correction for 13 C fractionation) is entered into the marine calibration program along with the delta-R, to obtain
a calibrated age range that can be expressed
either in years B.P. or in Calendar (B.C./
A.D.) years.
This procedure will inevitably produce a calibrated age on shell that aligns with that on charcoal
believed to be the same age (i.e., a sample within
the same context/provenience and thus "paired" with
the shell sample). This inevitability derives from
the fact that the delta-R value is inherently compensatory, in that it is a positive or negative value
arithmetically calculated to make up the difference
in ages between the supposedly paired shell-charcoal samples. While this procedure is valid if the
shell and charcoal are indeed of the same historical
age (although of differing uncalibrated radiocarbon
ages), it can be misleading if in fact the two samples
are actually of different ages, since, using the marine calibration, the age of any shell sample will
automatically align with the atmospherically calibrated age of a given charcoal sample simply because the calculation of the delta-R is designed to
bring the divergent ages into alignment.
The use of the marine calibration is thus valid
only when dating true paired samples with significantly divergent ages. Therefore, the fact that a
series of marine-calibrated shell ages align with
ages on charcoal samples does not, in itself, demonstrate the reliability of the approach in the absence of demonstrably paired shell-charcoal
samples (i.e., shell and charcoal from clearly discrete depositional units in which contemporaneity
is certain or highly probable). For example, if for
some reason one were to hypothetically posit that
a calibrated charcoal age intercept of, say, 1450 Â±
60 B.P. was paired with a conventional
(uncalibrated) shell age of 5000 Â± 60 B.P., the
procedures used in the marine calibration would
bring the ages into alignment, even though the age
differences are obviously too great to reasonably
infer contemporaneity. In this case, the delta-R is
3090, which, when entered into the marine calibration program (Stuiver and Braziunas 1993),

yields a calibrated age range on the shell of 15301340 B.P., with a single intercept at 1440 B.P.
This is virtually identical to the calibrated age
intercept for the charcoal.
The idea that conventional radiocarbon ages
on archeological shell samples from the Upper
Texas coast require an adjustment toward the
present is deeply entrenched. Aten (1979, 1983; see
also V alastro and Davis 1970) estimated that Rangia
shell dates should be corrected toward the present
by 225 years, based on an average discrepancy
between "paired" charcoal ages. He speculated that
such a correction might be required due to the exchange of "dead" carbon ions introduced into the
estuarine environment, through riverine discharge,
as dissolved carbonates originating in the limestone
bedrock of inland Texas. It is noteworthy, however, that Aten stated that this was only one possible explanation (not testable with existing
information), and he emphasized that the interpretation was preliminary and hypothetical.
Basically following Aten's work, Ensor (1995,
1998; see also Ensor, this volume) has employed a
"freshwater reservoir" correction of 540 years for
Rangia samples from the Eagle's Ridge site
(41CH252). This essentially mimics Aten's correction factor, since 540 years is subtracted from the
age after approximately 300 years are added for the
13
C correction (which was not done when Aten developed his correction factor). Ensor based this correction factor on "paired" samples that were
believed to be contemporaneous by virtue of their
apparent association within arbitrary levels and/or
stratigraphic units. As such, the pairs do not meet
the more rigorous contextual requirement of coming from a demonstrably discrete depositional unit,
and have all the potential problems of samples from
shell midden strata. Furthermore, as Ensor (1995:L1) acknowledges, "the 'reservoir effect' is of indeterminate magnitude since no studies have been
conducted on samples of the water which carried
the carbonates."

THE PROBLEM OF
QUESTIONABLE
PAIRED SAMPLES
When shells of known historic age from a
given coastal area are not available for radiocarbon
dating, the archeologist must rely on paired

Rick/is -Atmospheric Calibration and the Problem of Shell-Charcoal Pairing 481
samples of shell and wood charcoal to determine if
shell samples yield uncalibrated ages that are older
than terrestrial charcoal believed to be of the same
age (thus indicating that the shell ages do in fact
require a marine-reservoir calibration). Unfortunately, many, probably the great majority, of socalled paired samples used in chronology building
on the upper Texas coast are not demonstrably associated within discrete depositional units that indicate contemporaneous deposition of shell and
charcoal. Rather, almost all "paired" samples from
the area consist only of shells and scattered charcoal bits (often collected from screens rather than
from their primary contexts in features) from arbitrary vertical levels or more or less thick stratigraphic units that may have accumulated over
centuries (e.g., Ambler 1967; Aten 1983; Gadus
and Howard 1990). Such samples cannot be considered reliably paired, since contemporaneity of
deposition of shell and charcoal is based on possibly flawed assumptions.
The potential unreliability of "pairs" from such
contexts should be considered, a priori, for the
following reasons:

RESULTS ON TRUE PAIRED
SAMPLES FROM THE
TEXAS COAST
Identification of true paired samples is basically
a geoarcheological task, insofar as contemporaneity
must be shown on the basis of association of shells
and charcoal within primary natural or cultural
depositional units that can be confidently considered
to represent discrete events or relatively short
periods of time. To reiterate a key point, association
within arbitrary levels is inherently questionable,
since it relies on the potentially fallacious
assumption that such vertical provenience units do
not cross-cut the temporal sequence of midden
formation. Likewise, "pairing" of samples from
more-or-less thick stratigraphic units is also
potentially unreliable, since anything more than a
very thin lens of deposited shell midden may contain
materials spanning a time equal to, or greater than,
any possible difference in the conventional or
uncalibrated shell and charcoal radiocarbon ages.
Thus, true paired samples will inevitably be difficult
to locate, and will be relatively rare.
I review examples of true paired charcoal-shell
samples from the Texas coast. In all such cases, the
conventional radiocarbon age for shell samples (corrected for 13C) is not significantly older than, but
very similar, if not virtually identical to, that for
associated charcoal.
First, 41SP120 on Corpus Christi Bay had a
terminal Archaic deposit that was interpreted as a
discrete depositional unit (Ricklis 1993). The deposit consisted of a particularly dense lens of shell
debris, some 10 cm thick (Figure 1), that contrasted

l. As pointed out by Kibler (this volume), small

bits of charcoal may derive from hearths built
on top of existing (older) shell midden deposits, as suggested long ago by Ambler (1967),
the excavator of many of the Trinity River
delta deposits later discussed by Aten (1979,
1983). That hearths were commonly built on
existing shell deposits is well demonstrated
by the many small burned-shell patches within
shell-midden matrices recently documented
at the Eagle's Ridge site (Ensor and Ricklis
1998).
2. Charcoal particles are usually of
small size, and may have been vertically translocated by: (a) settling
of materials and (b) agencies of
bioturbation.
3. Discrete depositional units within
shell middens (especially Rangia
middens, where shell species diversity is minimal and deposits
tend to appear homogeneous) are
difficult to discern, and mixing of
materials is hard, if not impossible,
to detect.

burned clay/caliche nodules, charcoal, and oyster
and gastropod shells sealed within an otherwise
culturally sterile eolian clay-silt sediments. The corrected ages obtained on charcoal and oyster shells
are similar (4730 Â± 60 B.P. and 4960 Â± 60 B.P.,
respectively), and overlap at two-sigma when atmospherically calibrated.
In these several cases, true paired samples have
yielded 13 C-corrected ages on shell and charcoal
that are in close agreement. The use of a marine
calibration is unnecessary and inappropriate, since
the need for such a calibration exists when shell
dates are substantially too old relative to charcoal.
The similar conventional ages for paired shell and
charcoal indicate that the molluskan organisms lived
in essentially an atmospheric, rather than a marine,
environment, and the conventional ages of both the
charcoal and shell should, therefore, be adjusted
using an atmospheric calibration.
In light of shoreline environmental conditions
in Texas coast estuaries, the latter point is not
surprising, since in general shellfish were gathered from shallow bays and lagoons protected by
barrier islands, where, judging from modern environmental analogs, depths were probably on the

order of approximately 1-4 feet. Conditions were,
apparently, analogous to those found in small lakes,
in which "the exchange rate with the atmosphere is
dominant...[and] the change in specific 14C content
may well parallel the observed change in atmospheric 14C content" (Stuiver et al. 1986:980).

ADDITIONAL STRATIGRAPHIC/
TYPOLOGICAL SUPPORT FOR
THE USE OF ATMOSPHERIC
CALIBRATION OF SHELL AGES
An atmospheric calibration (Stuiver and
Reimer 1993) has been employed on samples from
other sites on the Texas coast, with satisfactory
results. This has proven useful, insofar as shell
samples thus calibrated produce age ranges in line
with expectations based on the estimated ages of
associated time-diagnostic artifact types and their
stratigraphic contexts.
At 41SP120 on Corpus Christi Bay, atmospheric calibrations of radiocarbon ages on two shell
samples (scallop and quahog, respectively) yielded
identical one-sigma ranges of 930-740 B .P. These

samples were extracted from a cleaned wall profile
(Figure 3), in which it was clear that both samples
came from a discrete depositional unit (a small
shell pile) resting on a Late Archaic shell midden
and immediately beneath a Late Prehistoric
Rockport phase component that produced, among
other temporal diagnostics, Perdiz arrowpoints and
asphaltum-coated/decorated Rockport ware ceramics (Ricklis 1993). The dated shell pile, on the other
hand, was marked by a dearth of ceramics and
associated unstemmed triangular arrowpoints,
shown to pre-date Perdiz in the southern part of the
central coast (cf. Corbin 1974; Ricklis 1995). The
atmospheric calibration thus placed these shells precisely in line with cultural-historical expectations,
that is, between ca. A.D. 1000 and 1200, between
the terminal Archaic component at the site, dated to
ca. A.D. 1000, and the Rockport phase, which on
typological grounds can be dated to ca. A.D. 1250/
1300-1700 (Ricklis 1992, 1995, 1996).
At the earlier end of the temporal range, three
atmospherically calibrated ages on Rangia flexuosa
shells from the McKinzie site (41NU221) on the
shore of Nueces Bay fell into a rather tight cluster
with age ranges between ca. 5300 and 5900 B.P.
(Ricklis 1988, 1995). The shells came from a thin,
discrete stratum that also produced dart points of
the Bell type, generally placed in the Texas chronology between 5000 and 6000 B.P. (e.g., Prewitt
1981; Collins 1994; Johnson 1994).
At the Lido Harbor Site (41 GV82) on the upper Texas coast, Weinstein (1991) identified a series of Late Prehistoric features consisting of
discrete pockets of Rangia shell. Although the features did not produce charcoal for pairing with the
shell, Weinstein found that atmospheric calibration
of the conventional radiocarbon ages on Rangia
samples yielded age ranges in line with expectations based on the artifact assemblage. He noted
that if the corrected ages were adjusted toward the
present (e.g., through use of a "freshwater" reservoir correction), they would have been significantly
too young for the kind of time-diagnostic artifacts
with which they were associated.

SUMMARY

Both the correction for the "freshwater"
reservoir and the marine calibration rest on untested
or questionable assumptions. The use of a freshwater

correction factor for Rangia shells from the upper
Texas coast rests on the assumption that estuarine
mollusks absorbed "old" dissolved carbon ions
derived from limestone bedrock located several
hundred kilometers upstream. While this may
ultimately prove to be so, it should be noted that
this does not apply in the case of shell samples
from the Nueces-Corpus Christi Bay estuary, which
receives freshwater input from the Nueces River,
the headwaters of which drain the limestone-rich
region of the southern Edwards Plateau. Although
it has been found that shells growing within a few
kilometers of carbonate sources do absorb "old"
carbon (Darden Hood, 1997 personal communication), it is as yet unclear if this applies to
mollusks in aquatic environments at considerable
distances downstream.
The use of a marine calibration is predicated
upon the questionable assumption that the shallow, protected estuaries of the upper coast cons ti tu te a marine reservoir rather than an
atmospheric 14C environment. Given the current
absence of historically collected shells of known
age, the valid calibration of corrected ages of
archeological shell samples must rest on the empirical association of shell with essentially contemporaneous wood charcoal. As presented
herein, confidently paired samples have, to date,
produced similar or virtually identical uncalibrated
ages on shell and charcoal, indicating that an atmospheric calibration is appropriate.
Still, the fact that most upper coast shell
samples are older than charcoal from the same stratigraphic/arbitrary levels will require explanation. At
this point, it is possible only to suggest two alternative hypotheses to explain this tendency:
1. Some, perhaps many, shell samples from the
upper coast do in fact produce ages older than
those of truly contemporaneous charcoal, thus
requiring a non-atmospheric correction or calibration; or
2. Charcoal particles are commonly younger than
shells within a given vertical provenience because: (a) small charcoal bits tend to be translocated downward within the context of larger,
more stationary shells; (b) prehistoric site occupants tended to rather consistently build fires
on the surfaces of pre-existing, older shell deposits; (c) or a combination of these factors.

Rick/is - Atmospheric Calibration and the Problem of Shell-Charcoal Pairing 487
While the data generated by true shell-charcoal
pairs suggest that an atmospheric calibration is
appropriate, there are presently too few true paired
shell-charcoal samples from the upper Texas coast
for a final resolution of this problem. Given the
abundant availability of shell in regional shoreline
sites and the general scarcity of charcoal in clearly
primary contexts, the need for a consensus on how
to reliably adjust radiocarbon ages on shell is
obvious. Until a larger series of true paired samples
are available from the upper Texas coast area,
however, it seems ill-advised to assume that a
marine or freshwater calibration on conventional
shell dates is generally appropriate. Ongoing
research in the upper coast area should, therefore,
place strong emphasis upon finding additional,
clearly paired samples that are extracted from within
demonstrably discrete depositional units.

ABSTRACT

The Lake Jackson State Archeological Landmark (41B0172), the Lake Jackson Plantation, in Lake
Jackson, Texas, was a sugar and cotton plantation that operated in the 19th century. Abner Jackson was one of
the largest sugar producers in Texas. Following the Civil War, convict labor was used to tend the sugar plants
and refine the sugar. The hurricane of 1900 severely damaged the sugar mill and the mill was closed.
This 2.719 acre site contains the ruins of 12 structures, including the main house and sugar mill area of the
plantation. Historic records document the evolution of sugar technology between the 1840s and 1900.
Archeological evidence was found to support and clarify those changes at the Lake Jackson sugar mill.
The 1994 and 1995 Texas Archeological Society (TAS) field schools excavated portions of the ruins of the
main house; the sugar mill; and structures A-D and I. These two field school are responsible for 90 percent of
the excavations at the site. Field classes by the University of Houston Clear Lake in 1996-1998 completed
excavation units at the sugar mill begun by the TAS.

INTRODUCTION
The 1994 and 1995 Texas Archeological Society (TAS) field schools excavated portions of the
19th century main house, the sugar mill, and structures A-D and I at the Lake Jackson State Archeological Landmark site (4IBO172) in Brazoria
County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The two field
schools are responsible for 90 percent of the excavations at the site. Without the excellent and dedicated work of the field school participants, this part
of Texas history would have taken years to uncover. Field classes by the University of Houston
Clear Lake between 1996 and 1998, completed excavation units at the sugar mill begun by the TAS
field schools. This paper includes the results of all
field work at the site through 1998.
History documents where plantations were located (Platter 1961), who their owners were (Strobel
1926), and how much sugar they made
(Champomier 1852-1858). Records have not been
located, however, that describe the size, layout, and
processual orientation of the sugar mills along the
lower Brazos River valley. Archeological research

at sites like Lake Jackson has provided this missing
information on the first industry in Texas, that of
refining sugar. The Lake Jackson sugar mill is of
great importance because the mill was first constructed using the fire heat method of sugar reduction. After the Civil War, the mill underwent
alterations-to adapt to new technologies-that
have been documented archeologically. The archeological contributions made by the Texas Archeological Society during the 1994 and 1995 Field
Schools have greatly enhanced our ability to better
understand a new chapter in Texas history.
Plantation Archeology in Texas
and Research Objectives
The "sugar bowl" of Texas includes Brazoria,
Fort Bend, Matagorda, and Wharton counties. It
was dominated by large sugar and cotton plantations
(Creighton 1975:204). The historic documents
available about plantation history in Brazoria
County include public records (i.e., censuses, tax
records, probate records), plantation journals and
records, agricultural journals, diaries and letters,

the plantation?
3. How did life on a plantation relate to the economic and social worlds of its owners and
slaves? and,
4. How was space used? What economic and
social behavior is reflected in the allocation of
space?
Research also included the following excavation objectives:

documents and the archeological deposits we are
seeking answers to the questions:
1. How did the plantation system work? How
did they produce sugar? What changes in the
sugar process are documented in the archeological record?
2. How self-sufficient was each plantation system? How many artifacts were imported and

The site was laid out in one foot squares. Excavation units in all areas were 3 x 3 feet except for
the sugar mill, where units were 9 x 9 feet. Units
are labeled by their southwest corner coordinates.
The site datum for vertical measurement was the
top of the historical marker located east of the main
house. The equator/prime meridian intersection for
horizontal measurement was an arbitrary point north
of the historical marker set in concrete with a brass
pin. When matrix was screened, 1/4-inch mesh was
used. Excavation levels were 0.5 feet in thickness.
In each area, the number and placement of excavation units were determined by the research objectives. In some excavation units, the objective was
to expose architectural features without removing
the features. In excavation units not obstructed by
architectural features, excavations proceeded until
sterile soil was reached.

Recognizing Patterns in
Historical Archeology
A pattern is the arrangement and configuration
of artifacts (including structures, land alteration,
deposits, etc.) by type and quantity that reflect cultural activities, cultural time periods, and cultural
change. The assumption is that every social system
has identifiable survival strategies; that every survival strategy has a measurable amount of energy
and resources; that every household and business
reflects the whole system through objects used; that
all systems are reflected in patterns; and that meaningful patterns can be identified in the archeological record by: (1) artifact numbers (how many), (2)
artifact association (with what), and (3) artifact distribution (where).
At Lake Jackson, we used Stanley South's
(1977) quantitative pattern by artifact type. South's
artifact grouping system is used because it applies to
all historic sites. The artifact groupings quantitatively identify the specific patterns of cultural function, whether the site is a plantation, farm, factory,
fort, or urban or rural site. South classifies and groups
artifacts according to specific functions: kitchen artifacts include all storage, cooking and eating utensils,
and all bottles including pharmaceuticals; bone
(food); architecture includes window glass, nails,
bolts, and all construction hardware, including door
locks; furniture includes hinges, knobs, drawer pulls
and locks, curtain pulleys, mirrors, chimney lamps,
and glass; arms includes bullets, shot, gun flints, gun
parts, and bullet molds; clothing includes buttons,
buckles, thimbles, scissors, pins, and beads; personal
includes coins, keys, and personal items (combs,
jewelry, watches, pencils, pens); activities includes
construction tools, farm tools, toys, fishing gear,
stable and barn objects, miscellaneous hardware (unidentified metal); miscellaneous includes everything
that does not fit into any other group as well as 20th
century garbage (South 1977:95). For this study we
eliminated South's smoking pipe group because so
few pipes were found, and then added a prehistoric
category because of the presence of prehistoric materials (see Few et al., this volume).
All artifacts were counted and grouped: (1) by
level to reflect a level pattern to determine what
activities may have taken place in the same place at
approximately the same time; (2) by excavation unit
to reflect the unit pattern to determine if similar or
different activities took place in the same place over

491

time; (3) by structure to reflect a structure pattern to
determine how the structure was used; (4) by room
to reflect a room pattern to determine how a room
was used; (5) and for the entire site to reflect the site
pattern of a 19th century cotton-sugar plantation.
These quantitative patterns will help to identify
activity areas and the function of different structures.
Looking at particular artifact types can be helpful in
identifying the function of a structure. Artifact types
must be examined both as a percentage of the total
number of artifacts and the actual count of specific
artifact types. For example, we would expect that
furniture-related artifacts would be found in higher
concentrations within domestic dwellings, as well as
arms artifacts. Guns and ammunition would not have
been unattended but would have been kept in domestic areas for defense and for security of the
weapon. The .highest numbers (count, not percentage) of arms and furniture artifacts were found in the
structures where people lived, the main house and
Structure B. The arms artifacts found around Structures A, C, D, and I were close to the surface, however, and relate to gun use during the Dow Chemical
Company Park period. Clothing artifacts, personal
artifacts, and ceramics were concentrated at the main
house and structures B and D where people lived.
Structure B was constructed during the Jackson period, and structure D after the Civil War. The site
pattern as reflected in the count and percentage of
provenienced artifacts is provided in Table 1. Table

HISTORY OF JACKSON
PLANTATION
When Abner and Margaret Jackson brought
their children and slaves to Brazoria County, Texas,
in the early 1840s, they joined the many immigrants to the new Republic who were drawn by the
richness and availability of the land. In Brazoria
County, the annual growing season is over 270
days with an average annual rainfall of 47 inches
(Platter 1961 :4-5). The alluvial soils of this Gulf
Coast Plain, which produced both sugar and cotton
in abundance, were a source of great wealth for the
planters. The early settlers found hardwood forest
teeming with game. The Brazos and San Bernard
rivers, Oyster Creek, and numerous meandering
bayous, provided transportation. Between the
Brazos River and Oyster Creek (an abandoned channel of the Brazos River), the Jackson family established their Lake Jackson Plantation.
In 1844, Abner Jackson began to acquire the
land that would become his first plantation, Retrieve.
That same year Jackson sold half of Retrieve and
started purchasing land that would become the "Lake
Place," the Lake Jackson plantation (see Figure 2).

Abner Jackson Strobel (Strobel 1926:22), the
grandson of Margaret Strobel Jackson and the stepgrandson of Abner Jackson, provides a description
of the Lake Jackson plantation in his narrative of
the old plantations of Brazoria County:
Major Jackson ... opened up the Lake Jackson Plantation during the period 1842 to
1845. His first home was made of logs
from the nearby forest, mostly elm and
ash. He soon, however, converted every
building, cabins, sugar house and residence, into brick made on the plantation,
and stuccoed with cement fully an inch
thick, which made all buildings look like
they were made from solid rock. The residence was a twelve room two-story house
in the shape of an "I," with six galleries,
and immense brick pillars the entire length
of the galleries. It was cool in summer
and warm in winter with its large fire
places. Built Colonial style, the residence
cost, exclusive of slave labor, over
twenty-five thousand dollars completed.
The lake abounded in fish ... There were
boats in plenty for the use of the guests
and family, and the lake abounded in
ducks in winter, and at that time and as
late as 1868, plenty of deer, bears and

Few -

turkeys could be found. The sugar house
was built of brick, and the best of machinery for the making of sugar was obtained. There was an artificial island
made in the lake, said to have cost
$10,000 and is visible to this day [1926].
Fine orchards and gardens were on the
plantation. Peaches, pears, quince, plums,
grapes and strawberries were raised.
Brick walks were laid in the orchard and
garden. The slaves had use of both orchards and gardens.
The Brazoria County census taken on October
14, 1850 lists: Abner Jackson, 40; Margaret Jackson, 43; Arsenath M., 15; John C., 12 and at school
in Brazoria County; Andrew, 10; George W., 8;
and Abner Jr., 3. Margaret also had a son by a
previous marriage, Louis M. Strobel, who is not
listed.
Jackson continued to acquire property, and by
1850, the Lake Jackson plantation included 3744
acres. In 1852, Jackson produced 295 hogsheads of
sugar with horse-driven machinery at the Lake Plantation, and with his partner, James Hamilton at Retrieve, he produced an additional 450 hogsheads.
On January 7, 1857, Margaret Jackson died.
According to documents on file in the probates of
Abner Jackson and Margaret Jackson, Abner Jackson asked his children and his stepson, Louis M.
Strobel, not to claim their share of their mother's
estate because he needed the estate intact for purposes of expansion. That same year, Jackson purchased the Darrington Plantation for $116,200. The
sugar mill at the Lake Jackson plantation was upgraded with the addition of a steam engine in 1858
when 90 hogsheads of sugar were produced.
Death and the Civil War brought an end to the
Jackson family's good fortune. Abner Jackson died
in 1861 deeply in debt. Probate records indicate
that during the Civil War, John C. Jackson tried to
hold the estate together and pay off debts when
funds were available. When the war ended, George
W. Jackson returned home. John C. was in control
of the estate and would not turn over any part of it
to George. In September 1867, a court order enabled
George W. Jackson to gain control of the Lake
Jackson plantation (1867 Deed L-600), but conflict
remained between the two brothers. In December
1867, George W. killed his brother John C. during
a confrontation at the Lake Jackson plantation

493

(Strobel 1926). George W. was never prosecuted
for the murder and he died of tuberculosis on
November 7, 1871 in Galveston (1871 Will, Case
No. 923). Wm. J. W. Masterson became executer
of the estate of Abner and Margaret Jackson. An
attempt to hold the estate together was made, but
documents indicate that debtors were demanding
payment. Subsequently, the estate was sold piece
by piece. When the estate was finally settled in
1873, only three members of the Jackson family
remained: Lewis M. Strobel, son of Margaret
Strobel Jackson; Arsenath Jackson Groce, the
daughter of Margaret and Abner Jackson; and Frank
Jackson, the son of John C. Jackson.
In 1873, William W. Phelps of New York
bought the Jackson Plantation from the estate of
George W. Jackson and his sister, Arsenath Jackson Groce, for $20,800 (1873 Deed, 19, 24). Phelps
sold the property to A. J. Ward and E. D. Deevey
for $36,000 that same year.
After the Civil War, Texas adopted a system of
leasing state convicts to private companies and individuals. Due to the availability of convict labor,
the 1870s saw an increase in agricultural production. "By the end of the 1870s, the sugar industry in
Texas, according to production figures, was recovering from the effects of the Civil War" (Johnson
1961:52).
In 1871, the state leased the Huntsville State
Prison and all of its prisoners to Ward, Dewey &
Co. of Galveston for a 15-year period. They in turn
leased convicts to the Lake Jackson Plantation. An
1874 inspection of the Lake Jackson Plantation and
their prisoners found many of them to be ill and
without medical attention. The inspector found that
three convicts had been severely beaten on their
backs; that prisoners were not being fed well; that a
guard had pledged his own credit to procure meat
for the convicts; that convicts had not changed their
clothing for 10 weeks and that some could not
cover their extremities; and that some prisoners
slept on bare mattresses without cover (Governor's
Records, State Archives 1874-1876:13). In the 1876
report, the inspector reported that the convicts
"seems better clothed, fed, and in better health"
(Governor's Records, State Archive 1876:7). In
December 1876, when Inspector J. T. Gaines made
his rounds, he reported that three convicts had died
at the Lake Jackson Plantation: one died while being punished in the stocks, one in an escape attempt, and one from natural causes.

Texas Archeological Society

In 1875, Edward H. Cunningham and Littleberry
A. Ellis formed a partnership. They contracted with
the State of Texas to lease the entire convict population. Those convicts they did not use were sub-leased
to other plantations. Their partnership and use of
convict labor was the beginning of the Imperial Sugar
Company of Sugarland, Texas (Armstrong 1991).
In 1882, 1040 prisoners were contracted out in
groups to individuals for $15 per prisoner per month.
The lessee had to furnish housing, food, and guards.
Lessees were entitled to 10 hours of work per day per
prisoner (Walker 1988:71). The Biennial Reports of
the Penitentiary Board and of the Texas State Penitentiary (Governor's Records, State Archives 18801882) list the Darrington Plantation with 28 convicts
and the Lake Jackson Plantation with 36 (Johnson
1961 :43). In 1884, the Lake Jackson and Patton plantations, both in Brazoria County, had a combined
total of 314 convicts (Governor's Records, State Archives 1886). The last listing for convicts at Lake
Jackson was on November 1, 1884, with a total of 33
convicts (Governor's Records, State Archives 1884).
In 1900, the Lake Jackson Sugar Company took
over the four acres containing the "sugar house,
including the cane mill sheds, gin, saw mill, blacksmith shop" (1900 Deed: 51.245). The Lake Jackson Sugar Company operated only a short time.
The mill was severely damaged during the 1900
hurricane and mill operations ceased.
The land was used for cattle grazing until 1941
when it was bought by A. P. Beutel. Beutel purchased much of the acreage around the lake ( 1941
Deed, Co. 346:537). The town site of Lake Jackson, Texas, was platted in 1943 on other portions of
the land surrounding the original Lake Jackson Plantation. In 1945, Dow Chemical Company turned
the area containing the ruins of the plantation into a
park for public and company use. Called "Lake
Jackson Park" and "Dow Park," the area was used
for social activities of all kinds. In 1989, the park
was closed and the land was traded to its present
owners, the Lake Jackson Historical Association,
who have turned the site into a historic park.

3 is the only known photograph taken of the main
house before the 1900 hurricane, which damaged
the structure. Abner L. Strobel is seen in the
foreground of the picture. Figure 4 is an outline, or
footprint, of the main house ruins drawn after
excavations exposed architectural features.
The west side of the main house was chosen
for excavation because this side of the house faced
a number of structural ruins arranged in a manner
suggesting that they functioned in association with

THE ARCHEOLOGICAL FINDINGS

field schools was to identify the plantation period
exterior ground/living surface. To do this, we looked
for evidence of walkways, garden borders, and brick
roadways, as Abner L. Strobel's (1926) account of
the plantation mentions orchards and gardens with
brick walkways.
Excavations at the west side of the front porch
of the main house (termed research area A) (see
Figure 4), focused on uncovering the step area (Figure 5) and locating the drive and walkways around
the main house. The front walkway/driveway was
discovered with bricks of excellent quality, laid in
a curved pattern (Figure 6).
Other features in the area of the front porch
also document the ground surface level of the Jackson period. Just west of the front steps, a brick
border was located. Just to the east of the brick
border, between the front steps and the border, was
a layer of Rangia shells all turned bulb, or outside,

up. This same configuration of shells was found off
the back porch below the convict period walkway
and next to the Jackson period walkway.
On the back north side of the main house, the
foundation was exposed down to its base. The
level where the foundation joined the structure
was the same level as the plaster base on the front
porch that established ground level during the plantation period.
Off the west back porch, a convict period sidewalk was found above a Jackson period walkway
(Figure 7). This uneven convict walkway of poorlymade whole and half bricks, one brick layer in
depth, raised the walking area about 0.5 foot above
the Jackson walkway and extended out from the
back porch toward the cistern and Structure D.
For all of the above reasons, we conclude that
the Jackson occupational level starts at 1.5 feet
below the surface (base of level 3). Artifacts

between 1.5-2.0 feet below surface (bs) appear to
be a mixture of the Jackson period and the late 19th
century occupation. Deposits from 2.0-3.0 feet bs
appear to represent the Jackson period use of the
site. The artifacts, especially ceramics, buttons, and
datable objects in the lower levels of excavation
were manufactured in the 19th century: the ceramics
from 2-2.5 feet bs ranged in age from 1847-1896,
and dated from 1838-1879 in deposits below 2.5
feet bs. These dates are based on the minimum
vessel count of each ceramic type/decorative style
(and their corresponding diagnostic dates) in each
level. Ceramic decorative styles are serial and
documented with manufacturer's periods of
production. The type of clay in the area would
make for easy "percolation" of small artifacts
moving up and down within the soil, thus making
a clear line of distinction difficult between
occupations.
Artifacts excavated in the Main House area
total 44,935. Most were found between 1.0-2.0 feet
bs (see Table 2).

Architectural Features
of the Main House
The front steps illustrate the quality of masonry construction of the main house. The specially
designed bricks used in construction are in situ.
The edge of the front porch and the edge of the
three steps ascending the front porch are rounded
(see Figure 5). The rounded edge is also found in
the two steps of the west side back porch (see

Figure 7). The front porch step area is of solid
whole bricks, some laid on their sides for additional
strength. Figure 6 shows the curved bricks of the
front walkway/driveway. Portions of the plaster that
originally covered the steps are still visible between
the steps and under the curved edge bricks.
Another architectural feature of the porches is
the columns. There were four columns spanning
the front porch and two columns on the back west
porch. These columns included triangular bricks
(Figure 8). The triangular bricks alternated with
hand-shaped bricks, bricks made whole but shaped
by the mason to fit a specific place. This configuration of triangular and shaped bricks formed the
circular shape of the columns.

Figure 8. Column Remains, note the triangular bricks.
The Front Gallery, or main room, was located
on the south side of the house (see Figure 4). Excavation of the fireplace hearth indicated the height
of the floor. The floor of the house is assumed to
have been made of wood on a surface that was
approximately three feet above the ground. A crawl
or "ventilation" space was located between the floor
and the ground as evidenced by the metal vents
found on each side of the fireplace and in each of
the north and south walls by the fireplace. The
hooks for the grates that covered the vents were
still in place on both sides of the west fireplace.
The back porch on the west side of the main
house was a smaller version of the front porch, having
two columns instead of four and two steps instead of
three. The columns were identical in size to those on
the front porch and the steps were identical with the
decorative curved bricks on the edge of the steps.
Columns and steps were plastered on both porches.

Personal artifacts found off the back porch provide a glimpse of the possessions of the people
living and visiting the main house during the Convict Labor period (dating from 1873 to 1900). The
Glass family was living in the house during the
1900 hurricane, when they lost most of their possessions, according to an oral history by Mrs. Rae
Glass Smith (Murray 1976). Mrs. Smith recalled
that the storm deposited a layer of mud. Some of
the personal artifacts found in this back porch area
that may have belonged to the Smith family include
a ring, a 1893 penny, slate pencils, a key, a metal
purse clasp, the lid to a cream jar, a pin (jewelry), a
stone pipe fragment, the back of a pocket watch
with the serial number 2330835, a rubber comb
with an 1851 patent date, harmonica parts, pieces
of a china doll head (found in five different excavation units), and a piece of shell jewelry. Also found
was a 1945 nickel.

its brick floor intact. On the east side, we found a
brick walkway similar to the Convict-era walkway found on the west side of the main house.
Features

There are four features of significance in
Structure A: the brick floor inside the structure;
the brick walkway on the east side of the
structure; the holes for roof support beams in the
center of the structure; and a pothole dug through
the floor of the structure after the structure was
abandoned.
The brick floor was encountered just below the
grass. The absence of overburden, the proximity to
the surface, and the fact that the ruins had been
bulldozed to ground level explains the absence of
artifacts on the brick floor. No evidence was found
for a hearth or doorways.
The area around the brick walkway contained
the largest number and most important artifacts.

those in plantation period buildings; and (5) the
exterior walkway on the east side of Structure A
was constructed of the same type of brick and is the
same quality and size as the Convict period walkway at the main house.
Artifacts found in Structure A date from the
post-Civil War era to 1900. This supports the
conclusions drawn from its structural aspects. The
artifacts also support the idea that this may have
been a storage structure. All of the artifacts in situ
are activity artifacts that would have been kept in a
barn or storage structure.

foundation, which was built during the 1851-1873
plantation period.

Artifacts in Structure A
The surface clearing and bulldozing of Structure
A, and the material debris deposited during the
Dow Chemical Park period ( 1945-1989), account
for the artifacts found in the first level of the
excavations. The only in situ artifacts were found
east of the structure between the fallen east wall
and the Convict period (1873-1900) walkway. These
artifacts were mostly activity artifacts which
included a wagon wheel hub, fragments of a metal
plow, a horse shoe, a metal ring, hooks, a pipe
wrench jaw, a cast iron frame for a pulley, a hatchet
head, a T-shaped rail, a stove bolt with nut, a large
metal chain, a cutter blade, gear fragments with 10
teeth, and a metal cylinder. A Yale lock, dated
1878, was also recovered. Cup fragments of a white
granite ware were found in this area with a Holland
mark that circulated between 1850-1890 (Pollan,
this volume).

StructureB
Structure B was a three room brick structure.
The three rooms are A (north room), B (middle
room with brick floor), and C (south room) (Figure
10). The exterior of the structure was covered with
white-washed plaster, the interior, with whitewash
on brick. The exterior dimensions of the structure
were 30 x 15 feet. Rooms A and B were partially
destroyed during the construction of a drainage ditch
dug during the 1945 construction of Dow Park. A
brick exterior surface/walkway was found east of

Summary of Structure A
Structure A was built during the
Convict Labor period, between 1873
and 1900. The TAS excavation of
several other structures at Lake Jackson provide a standard for comparison, particularly with respect to the
1851 main house in terms of bricks
(size, quality, uniformity) and building techniques. Several structural aspects point to the conclusion that
Structure A was a post-Civil War
structure: (1) the bricks are not uniform and are a different size from the
main house bricks; (2) the bricks used
in the construction of the main house
bricks were whole, while both whole
and half bricks were used in Structure A; (3) the masonry at the main
house was solid and the mortar
cleaned, but in Structure A, the mortar was allowed to "bleed" (i.e., it
was not cleaned off of the sides of
the foundation); (4) the interior foundation does not have "steps" like

Room B, Structure B

A total of 8829 artifacts were recovered in the
Structure B area (see Table 2). The artifact pattern
by type for each room is given in Table 3. Artifacts found in room A totaled 356; in room B,
513; and in room C, 6,567. The discrepancy in the
total number of artifacts is due to the differing
number of units excavated in each room and the
depth of each unit.

Room B contained a brick floor, and excavation
stopped at the surface of the floor (Table 4 ). In unit
S99W234, the construction of the Dow drainage
ditch disturbed the floor. Excavation of this unit
exposed the two layer brick floor and exposed
historic artifacts, which were not removed, under
the floor in the east wall profile. The brick floor
could be an addition covering an earlier living
surface. The floor was level with a slight fluctuation.
The 513 artifacts (primarily nails and window glass
fragments) found in room B do not reflect any
particular activity pattern. No evidence of doorways
were detected in the excavations.

Room A, Structure B

Room C, Structure B

Five units were excavated to expose walls and
foundations in room A. No evidence of a floor was
found. Along the East wall, a door was bricked up
and the new exterior wall area of the door was
sealed with plaster and then whitewashed. There is
no evidence of another door in the remains of room
A. Most of the artifacts found in room A were
bottle glass, nails, window glass, and animal bones;
they were in areas where surface disturbance had
occurred. Many were deposited in the 20th century.

In room C (the south room) artifacts were most
common in levels 5 and 6. The large number of
personal and clothing artifacts suggest that room C
may have been a domestic living area. Among the
clothing artifacts were a Louisiana militia button of
vest size with a pelican on the front and "extra
quality" on the back. According to Albert (1976),
this button was manufactured in 1859 and 1860. A
thin gold coating on the button is still visible. The
other 173 buttons found in Structure B were of

during the Jackson period. Later a brick floor may
have been added during the post-Civil War Convict period.

Structure B Summary
Structure B was built during the Jackson plantation period and modified on several occasions.
The brick foundation is similar in design and masonry to the main house built in 1851. Room C
appears to have originally had a dirt or possibly a
wooden floor. The amount of trash accumulated in
the comer of room C at level 6 suggests a dirt floor.
Interior whitewash was detected on the east wall in
room C (see Table 4).
Room C was a domestic residence where plantation activities may have occurred. During the
Convict period, a brick floor was laid down, as
suggested by the bricks along the north wall of the
room. The bricks of the original fire hearth were
covered by the new brick flooring. In an oral history given by Mrs. Ray Glass Smith (Murray
1976), she referred to structure B as the "jail." If
so, this structure could have been remodeled by
sealing off one door, removing the interior walls,
and installing a secure brick floor to leave a large
space for confinement.

Structure C
Structure C was excavated by the TAS Field
School in 1994. It is located to the north of the
main house and on the southern shore of Lake Jackson (see Figure 2). Structure C was built during the
Jackson period. This is apparent because the structure was built with whole bricks of the same size,
the masonry is of fine quality, and the stepped
interior foundation of the structure is of the same
type of construction observed in Structure B and
the main house.
Several factors have impacted the archeological
integrity of Structure C. First, aerial photos taken
during the 1930s and 1940s indicate that Lake
Jackson was smaller in size than today and is an
oxbow lake or old channel of the Brazos River.
However, Lake Jackson fluctuated in size according
to rainfall. With the development of the residential
area around the lake, the residents established a
lake association that keeps the lake at a constant
level by artificial means. Second, the north wall of
Structure C is in the lake vegetation on the edge of

501

the lake. The Lake Jackson Historical Association,
owners of the Lake Jackson State Archeological
Landmark site, are not members of the Lake
Association; therefore, activities along the edge of
the lake that might disturb the vegetation or stir up
mud were prohibited. Third, Structure C shows
evidence of having been mechanically leveled in
the past. The standing ruins were removed (perhaps
shoved into the lake) by heavy equipment, probably
during the construction of Dow Park. The brick
floors remain, but there are no standing walls.
Structure C is likely the wash house. It is
composed of two brick floor surfaces (10.5 x 11.5
feet) that are surrounded by plastered drains. The
drains empty north into the lake. The plaster is the
same as that found on the exterior walls of the
Main House and Structure B. The drain curbs are
also plastered on the sides and tops. Along the
south wall of the wash house, abutting the drain
curb, is a brick border.
Most of the artifacts came from the surface of
the brick floor or around the edges of the structure. Excavations uncovered the structure but did
not excavate through it in order to preserve what
was left of the structure. A hole in the brick floor
in Unit N30/W63 (Figure 12) permitted subfloor
excavations but no artifacts were found in the levels under the floor. Because of the previously mentioned leveling damage, and the close proximity
of the floor to the ground surface, artifact integrity
is dubious. A plantation the size of Lake Jackson
and the number of people in the Jackson family
would have required a considerable amount of
time for washing linens, clothing, and dishes. Any
objects that would fall on the floor during washing activities would probably have been either

picked up, or washed from the floor into the drain
and ultimately into the lake.

Structure D
Structure D (Figure 13) was uncovered in the
early spring of 1994 when the road laid by Dow
Chemical Company for their company park was
removed. The removal was accomplished by 1/2
inch "swipes" of a backhoe. The operator was
very skilled and able to delicately position the
backhoe for minimum damage to the remains under the road. Test units were excavated prior to
1994 by University of Houston Clear Lake students around the visible remains of Structure D,
but the main interior excavations of the rooms in
Structure D were undertaken by the TAS in 1994
and 1995.
The building of the road greatly impacted the
structure. The road bed was bulldozed to grade in
1945, leaving only the foundation of the structure
in place. Doorways could not be identified. The
structure must have had a wood or dirt flooring.

Artifacts below the road surface are from
apparently undisturbed contexts.
Structure D was a 40 x 20 foot structure that
had two rooms and two internal fireplaces in the
center of the structure. The foundations of the fireplaces indicate that the hearth in room B was larger
than in room A.
The two rooms, labeled A and B, had different quantities and types of artifacts. In room A, 13
3 x 3 foot units were excavated to sterile soil.
Units in both rooms were selected to expose the
fireplace hearth area or to randomly investigate
the rest of the room. Provenienced historic artifacts in room A totaled 3986. The artifact pattern
for room A is: Kitchen, 15.2 percent; Bone, 55
percent; Architecture, 25.6 percent; Arms, 0.3 percent; Clothing, 2.2 percent; Personal, 0.15 percent; and Activities, 1.3 percent. Kitchen artifacts
recovered in room A included ceramics, a bonehandled knife, and two copper forks with silver
plate. Architectural artifacts included window glass
and round and square nails. Arms included lead
shot, a fragment of a ram rod, and a shotgun shell
base. Clothing included two buckles and buttons

garments (Few et al. 1996:15.7). Personal artifacts included a Seated Liberty U.S. Dime, and
three clay pipe fragments. Activity-related artifacts included seven marbles, a porcelain doll face,
and a lock with an 1878 date.
The overall distribution of artifacts in the room
A units indicates a high concentration of debris was
located south of the fireplace. The alcove/closet/
cabinet (units Sl2Wl 17 and S12Wl20) south of
the fire hearth contained 43.3 percent of the artifacts found in room A and may have served as a
trash dump. A trash deposit was also found near the
fire hearth in the northeast corner of room C in
Structure B. The largest fragments of ceramics,
bone, knives, and forks were found in this deposit.
The domestic artifacts suggest that a family lived in
room A during the second part of the 19th century.
In room B, 13 3 x 3 foot units were excavated
to sterile soil. As in room A, some units contained
structural components and therefore were not completely excavated. Units were placed in the same
manner as in room A. Room B had 446 historic
provenienced artifacts from the 13 units. The artifact pattern is as follows: Kitchen, 30.9 percent;
Bone, 39.9 percent; Architecture, 27.8 percent; and
Activities, 1.3 percent.
Because the same number of units were excavated in rooms A and B, and in the same general
areas, theoretically differences in artifacts may relate to differences in activities between the two
rooms. The major differences in the types and quantities between the two rooms indicates that the rooms
were not used in the same way (Figure 14). Room
B may have had a domestic use but it does not
reflect the same level of use as room A. Architectural artifacts were broken window glass and square
and round nails. The activity artifacts in room B

503

were all unidentified metal.

Structure D Summary
There are several architectural attributes that
indicate this structure was built between 1873 and
1900 (Convict labor period). First, the bricks are
not as high in quality as those in the Jackson period
structures, in that their paste is less dense, more
sandy, and less durable. Second, the masonry is
poor quality whereas the masonry of the Jackson
construction is excellent quality. Third, the bricks
used in the foundation are fragmented, not whole.
Finally, the mortar in Structure D was allowed to
"bleed," a method not found in Jackson period construction. The poor construction techniques, along
with artifacts found in Structure D, suggest that it
was built after the Civil War. Room A may have
been occupied by a family, and because of its proximity, could also have served as a kitchen for the
occupants of the main house. Room B may have
served (hypothetically) several different functions:
office, jail, infirmary, residence, or guest quarters.

Sugar Mm
Prior to the 1994 and 1995 TAS field schools,
members of the Brazosport Archaeological Society
(BAS), the Houston Archeological Society (HAS),
and TAS spent many days removing the brick rubble
overburden from the mill allowing the field school
participants to excavate the mill. Excavation units
at the sugar mill were 9 x 9 foot blocks to open
large areas of this structure. Twenty-one blocks
were excavated by the field schools. Unfinished
blocks were completed by University of Houston
Clear Lake field classes.

To understand the three processes involved in
sugar making in the 19th century (i.e., extraction,
reduction, and crystallization), it is important to
understand what energy source was used to operate
the cane crushers, how the liquid flowed through
the process to become sugar, and how heat was
used in the sugar reduction process (see Few, this
volume). The historical records state that Jackson
began the mill using horse power to run the cane
crushers that extracted the juice from the cane. On

alterations. When the sugar began to crystallize in
the smallest, hottest kettle, the thick syrup was removed to cooling trays where the crystallization
process continued. When the sugar cooled, it was
placed in hogsheads (storage barrels) where the
remaining molasses (uncrystallized syrup) was allowed to drain out of the hogsheads. The room
where this separation occurred was called the
purgery (Figure 17).

Post-Civil War Sugar Production

the brick floor next to the cane crusher foundation, horse harnesses and large metal bands were
found (Figure 15). Jackson may have left the horse
tread mill in place as a back up power source after
the installation of a boiler to produce steam power
to operate the cane crushers. The foundation of
the cane crusher has been identified through comparative studies of other sugar plantations (see
Few, this volume). The large metal gears of the
cane crushers were also found near the base of
their foundation.
In 1858, Jackson installed a boiler, steam engine, and pump to operate the cane crushers. The
locations of the mill's boiler, engine and pump
have not been located. Although the boiler would
have had a tall chimney, the chimney foundation
has not been located. During construction of the
Dow Park road, the southwestern comer of the sugar
mill was bulldozed. It is possible that the boiler
foundation and chimney may have been in this disturbed area. A possible foundation was discovered
in 1994 just east of the foundation for the crusher
engine. Next to this feature, part of a boiler governor was also identified.
In the original Jackson mill, sugar cane juice
was reduced to a granular form in a "train of kettles"
(Figure 16), a series of large to small kettles heated
by a fire under the smallest kettle. The heat from
the fire was pulled through a flue under the series
of kettles by the draft of a flue chimney. The opening of the flue chimney and the chimney foundation (see Figure 16) also show the circular brick
remains of the kettle settings between two walls.
The flue chimney was separated from the kettle
area by a brick wall during the Convict period

The historical records and excavation results
document that the sugar making process at the Lake
Jackson mill changed after the Civil War to use
steam heat ("steam train") to heat the sugar kettles
in the reduction process. A property inventory done
in 1878 documents the change from fire to heat the
sugar kettles for the reduction process, to the use of
steam as a heat source. The inventory lists the
following items in use at the sugar mill: four boilers

mentioned above; sugar kettles; 1.5 miles of tram
road including the rails, ties, and fastenings of the
same; car used on said tram road; cane wagons;
cane carts; and Bagasse carts (Bagasse is processed

removed). The inventory also listed every piece
of equipment and tool that was on the plantation,
including all mattresses, blankets, and articles
used by the convicts, as well as all food reserves
(see 1878 Deed, Q557).
TAS excavations discovered that at some point,
the mill was substantially altered. The floors in the
sugar mill were raised, architectural features were
changed or demolished, walls were built, and doors
were blocked. Presumably, these alterations coincide with a change in the way the mill was used.
It is important to understand how the Jackson
period construction and Convict labor period

construction were identified in the sugar mill (see
Figure 17). Several attributes identify Jackson
period construction techniques: bricks are the same
size; bricks are high in quality; paste is
homogeneous, clay is dense, and firing is regular;
whole bricks are used in construction; bricks in
foundations and walls are very level; and the quality
of the masonry is excellent.
During the Convict Labor period, several distinctive construction techniques were used: bricks
of different sizes; whole and half bricks are used
together in construction; foundations and walls slope
and buckle; and masonry is very poor, bricks are
not level, mortar is uneven, and in some cases excess mortar is not removed to provide a smooth
vertical surface. Evidence of alterations made by
convict labor after 1873 includes:
Blocked Passageways: A blocked doorway was
found in the wall separating the kettle area
from the purgery. The east side of the wall
shows an enclosed portal with plastered walls,
while the west side has very sloppy, and uneven rows of bricks with "bleeding" mortar.
Raised Walls: The east/west wall, the south
wall of the Jackson kettle enclosure, is an

506

Texas Archeological Society
excellent example of a raised wall. A series of
iron masonry braces, placed about every four
or five feet, had been used to attach a new
section of wall to the earlier one (Figure 18).
This alteration may be due to the shift from fire
heat (train of kettles) to steam heat. The upper
portion of the train of kettles would have been
removed to expose the sides of the kettles. After
steam coils were wrapped around the kettles,
the kettle area would have been sealed to
enclose the kettles and contain the heat. This
would explain convict walls on top of plantation
walls in this area.
Raised Floors: The construction technique used
in the lower Jackson-era floor resembles the
foundation and walls built elsewhere in the site;
that is, they are substantial, level, and have
excellent masonry. The lime pit (see Figure 18)
and original Jackson period floor found in 1994
became the cornerstone for all other Jackson
floor identifications. By contrast, the upper or
raised Convict period floors are uneven. When
the floor is of brick, it is one brick thick and of
poor masonry construction. Convict period
floors were often of dirt and had between 11.25 feet of fill between the Jackson period
floor and the convict floor.

In 1995, more of the original Jackson plantation floor was uncovered along with a kettle setting (see Figure 16) and a heat flue in the middle
of the sugar mill. Since 1995, the other original

kettle settings have been located and the boiler and
engine platforms of the Convict period have been
identified. Based on historical and archeological
evidence, Figure 17 illustrates what the mill may
have looked like before and after alterations

Sugar Mm Artifacts
Eighty percent of the artifacts found at the Sugar
Mill (see Table 2) were bottle glass, nails, window
glass, and unidentifiable metal. Activity artifacts
found in the Sugar Mill were: the rollers of the cane
crusher; gears of the cane crusher; pipes and fittings; the governor of a steam boiler; wire cables; a
spade blade; an iron hoe; copper plate; a mason's
trowel; a blacksmith's punch; a cane knife; perforated copper sheeting; ball valves; elbow joints; a
Texas Department of Corrections hoe; a plow; the
top of an oil can or gasket; a shut off valve with an
ornate handle; a mica schist "whetstone;" a gas
engine fuel filter; metal strip fragments and barrel
bands; Haymes harnesses; a copper skimmer; large
pieces of metal which were probably parts of vats;
and a round brick gaming piece.
Twenty personal artifacts were found, including a plastic folding comb, a slate pencil, a china
doll's arm, a snuff can lid, a snuff box, an aspirin
box, three nickels (1833, 1926, and 1944), a Walking Liberty Half Dollar, a knife, a key, a compass
part, three clay smoking pipe fragments, and an
unidentified effigy pipe fragment.

Structure I

Figure 18. Braces in Sugar Mill Wall are in the
background, and the lime pit is in the foreground. A
filled-in door is on the right.

Structure I is located west of the Sugar Mill
(see Figure 2). The structures close to the Sugar
Mill-G-J-are referred to as the Industrial Complex. Twenty units were excavated during the TAS
field schools. There are several factors that have
damaged the archeological integrity of this structure, including the leveling of the structure by heavy
equipment and the proximity to Lake Jackson. Structure I is on the edge of Lake Jackson. Because
water and mud are holding the north wall of Structure I in place, the northern part of Structure I was
not excavated.
The main objectives in the excavation of Structure I were to expose enough of the structure to
determine the size, type of foundation, and structure function. The two weeks spent in excavation

Few - Lake Jackson State Archeological Landmark 1994 and 1995 Field Schools
during the T AS Fields Schools did not accomplish
this objective because this is a very large structure and there was not enough time to complete
the excavations.
Two trenches were opened, one east-west and
one north-south. The north-south excavations exposed a brick floor. The east-west excavations uncovered a rectangular hole between two brick walls.
Excavation of the rectangle exposed two brick foundations resting on a brick surface. An architect and
a brick mason concurred that this type of construction was used to support heavy load-bearing walls
and to stabilize foundations.
Because of the disturbance of the ruins of Structure I by heavy equipment, interpretation of this
structure must come from the architecture and artifacts in future excavations. The artifacts found in
Structure I did not indicate the function of the building or the activities that may have taken place there.
Unit N69E723 had the most interesting assemblage
of artifacts, including 10 harness buckles, a metal
bed frame part, a foot of a china doll, and a window
sash pulley.

SUMMARY
The Lake Jackson State Archeological Landmark (LJSAL) contains 2.719 acres of the approximate 5,000 acre plantation developed by Abner
Jackson in the late 1840s. The main structures of
the plantation were constructed on the south side of
Lake Jackson with the residential and industrial
areas about 300 feet apart. Historic records document Jackson as one of the largest sugar producers
in the state prior to the Civil War. Less than 2
percent of the LJSAL has been excavated, but seven
structures were partially excavated and five additional structures located during the T AS Field
School investigations.
Archeological excavations revealed the original
plan of the Sugar Mill, and the discovery of key
artifacts and features have defined how sugar was
made when the mill was first constructed. Horse
harnesses and metal bands found next to the
foundation of the cane crushers in the Sugar Mill
give evidence of a horse/mule treadmill as the
original source of power for the cane crushers.
Comparative studies of sugar mills in the Brazos
River valley (Few, this volume) supports the
identification of the foundation of the cane crushers

507

at Lake Jackson. Finding the rollers and gears of
the cane crushers on the floor next to the cane
crusher foundation verified the identification.
The location of the train of kettles and the flue
chimney are evidence that in the early years sugar
was processed by heat reduction, with fire being
the source of heat. Historical records state that after
the Civil War, the source of heat used in the reduction process changed from fire to steam: the "steam
train" method. This is supported in the archeological record by the extensive architectural alterations
made to the Sugar Mill around 1873: (a) the flue
chimney, a critical component in the use of fire for
heat, was sealed and walled off from the kettle
area; (b) the brick foundations that held the kettles
were partially destroyed so that steam coils could
be attached to the kettles; (c) the foundations were
then rebuilt, resulting in convict-built walls on top
of Jackson period slave walls in the kettle area; (d)
foundations for the boilers were built north of the
original mill to provide steam heat to the kettles;
(e) floors were raised; and (f) product traffic patterns, documented by sealed doorways, were altered to accommodate the new reduction process.
The evidence provided by artifacts cannot address the issue of the self-sufficiency of the preCivil War plantation operation because the only
provenienced domestic artifacts firmly associated
with the Jackson period are the ones in room C of
Structure B. The structure size, location, and the
simplicity of the artifacts (cheap buttons and common china) suggest the residence of slaves/house
servants. All of the items found were of industrial
manufacture, not home-made. The bricks used in
the Jackson buildings were made on site according
to historic records. They were of excellent quality
and did not bare makers marks; on some bricks,
hand prints of the workers can be seen. In the Sugar
Mill, bricks were found with makers marks (which
have not been identified) that may be associated
with the alterations to the mill after the Civil War.
Fire bricks (i.e., bricks with large coarse temper to
withstand high heat) were found in the arch of the
flue chimney, and were part of the Jackson period
construction. All of the artifacts found in the Sugar
Mill relating to the sugar making process were imported and industrially made.
Because of damage to the site and its structures, starting with the hurricane of 1900 and ending with the development of the Dow Chemical
Company park, which leveled many of the ruins

508

Texas Archeological Society

and built roads on top of others, the architectural
remains of the structures have provided the most
important cultural information about the site. Foundation construction, size and type of bricks, and
quality of masonry have made possible the identification of Jackson period structures, post-Civil War
structures (Convict period), structural alterations,
and structure function.
The main house, Sugar Mill, and structures B,
C, and I were built during the Jackson period. Structures A and D were built during the Convict period.
Structures E-H and J have not been excavated. The
Sugar Mill was extensively altered after the Civil
War. Structure B was altered by sealing doors, adding brick floors, and possibly removing interior
walls. Excavations around the main house found
convict walkways above Jackson period walkways.
Jackson period walkways helped determine the exterior living surface during that period. The absence or presence of exterior plaster covering the
bricks of the main house, as well as the dividing
line between foundations and walls, also helped
determine the exterior living surface. Profiles of
builders trenches in the Sugar Mill, built in the late
1840s, identified the land surface on which the
Sugar Mill was built; these surfaces are at the same
level as the main house built in 1851.
Buttons, chinawares, and bones, when found in
situ, can reveal information on activities, status,
time, cost, and trade. At Lake Jackson, some of
these artifact types were found in areas that can be
associated with the residents of the main house
during the Convict period (1873-1900); the people
living in room C of Structure D during the Jackson
period (1851-1873); and the residents of room A,
Structure D, during the Convict period. Only one
artifact, a Texas Department of Corrections hoe
found in the Sugar Mill, can be associated with the
convicts during the Convict period at the site.
The buttons found (Few et al. 1996:15.8) date
from the 19th century. Buttons were found in all
areas of the site but the highest concentrations were
at the main house and Structures B and D. Most of
the buttons reflect everyday clothes. Buttons from
the Victorian period were found at the main house
in levels associated with the Convict period.
The majority of bones (see McClure, this
volume) were found in areas where surface
disturbance, such as site leveling for the construction
of Dow Park and the construction of the Dow road,
made cultural associations difficult if not impossible

to ascertain. Structure B (Jackson period), in the
lower levels of excavation in room C, contained
domestic (cow, pig, and chicken) bones mixed with
indigenous wild species of mammal, fish, and fowl.
The trash deposit to the right of the fire hearth in
room A of Structure D (Convict period) contained
a wide variety of domestic and wild animal bones.
These two undisturbed areas in Structures B and D
provide the best view of food resources during the
Jackson and Convict periods.
Ceramics found at the site (see Pollan, this
volume) are simple, not expensive wares. Their
presence documents British trade wares in Texas
during the 19th century. The wares found in structures B and D, and around the main house, allow
inferences concerning the class and economic status of the residents of Lake Jackson during the
Jackson period as well as the later Convict period.
Most of the major components of the Sugar
Mill have been exposed and identified. The structural alterations in the mill document the changes
in sugar making in the 19th century. The personal
and activity artifacts found give a glimpse into the
daily lives of the occupants: toys of the children;
round gaming pieces of brick found in the Sugar
Mill; and the pocket watch, harmonica, simple jewelry, and buttons from other contexts. The artifacts
from the Dow Park period suggest that picnicking,
fishing, beer drinking, and target practicing were
frequent activities.
In summary, archeological excavations at Lake
Jackson between 1991 and 1998 have added to our
knowledge of the Indians that camped around the
lake (see Few et al., this volume). We also learned
more about the sugar industry that dominated the
economy of Brazoria County during the 19th century, and the way public park areas were used during the 20th century.

The China Cabinet at the Jackson Plantation:
Ceramic Analysis from the Lake Jackson State
Archeological Landmark Site (41B0172)
Sandra Driskill Pollan

ABSTRACT
Archival research indicates three historical occupation periods at the State Archeological Landmark site
(41B0172) located in Lake Jackson, Texas. The ceramics recovered corroborate the three occupations as well

as establish the occupants' use of the prime ceramics of choice during each of the site's incarnations as
Antebellum plantation; post-Civil War sugar mill; and as a 20th century community park.

INTRODUCTION
Once the hub of a Texas sugar empire created
by entrepreneur Abner Jackson, a Virginian by birth,
the Lake Jackson plantation no longer even faintly
resembles that long ago domain. Rather than stretching to the Brazos River some miles west, little more
than two acres remain along one border of Lake
Jackson. Remnants of the Lake Place, as it was
known in its heyday, consist of a few overgrown
mounds of building debris and the sad ambience of
earlier glory. This plot, set aside and preserved
from development in the small city of Lake Jackson, was deeded to that city's historical association
by the Dow Chemical Company. The Lake Jackson
Historical Association then had the site designated
a Texas State Archeological Landmark, thus protecting it for posterity.
Historical archeology classes began excavation at the site in 1992 under the instruction of Joan
Few of the University of Houston, Clear Lake. The
Texas Archeological Society annual summer field
school supplemented these efforts in 1994 and 1995.
More progress toward understanding the history of
this site is gleaned every season of excavation, and
the site promises many more years of study. The
intent of this paper is to discuss the ceramics and
how they corroborate or refute the written records
of early Brazoria County, and more specifically,
those concerning the Lake Jackson plantation.

The advantage to historical archeology is the
existence of a written record to corroborate and
expand the archeological record. In this case, archival research defined three basic occupation periods
at the Lake Jackson State Archeological Landmark
(LJSAL). The Jackson family's tenure comprises
the first (1842-1873)-known as the slave-labor or
Jackson period (Gross et al. 1989:4, 8). The second, the convict-labor period, existed at the plantation from as early as 1874-1884, but may have
lasted as late as 1912 (Few 1995:4.6; Walker
1988:94). The land served as pasture for several
different owners during the first half of the 20th
century. Eventually Dow Chemical Company established a park on the property for its employees
living in the adjacent company town of Lake Jackson. The land served in this manner from 1945 until
its closing in 1989 (Gross et al. 1989:2).
Further archival research has gleaned additional
details concerning the Jackson property, including
that an early 20th century habitation was in or near
the Sugar Mill (Gross et al. 1989:9). Another
recounts a noon meal served at the Retrieve sugar
house (another Jackson property in Brazoria
County), a practice that may have been common
during the peak cane season (Democrat and Planter
1858). These two items may explain the presence
of 20th century and Jackson period ceramics in the
Sugar Mill. A third item found in the Jackson
probate records details an 1863 estate sale that may

account for the low numbers of Jackson-era
ceramics evidenced so far at the home compound
(Brazoria County Probate Record Case 764: C627).

THE SITE
An archeological survey conducted by the
Brazosport Archaeological Society in 1989 documented at least eight structures (Gross et al.
1989: 13). Excavation and road removal bring the
total to at least 11. Excepting the Big House and the
Sugar Mill, each structure is known by its letter
designation until the buildings' function(s) within
the plantation can be determined. To recognize patterns in the character and distribution of the ceramics, they are analyzed structure by structure; as a
whole; and within two groups: the residential component and the industrial element. The residential
component, or Home Compound, includes the Big
House and structures A-F (see Few, this volume).
These buildings are located very near the main residence and may have housed activities involved in
the upkeep of the physical plant or sustenance of
those living in the Big House. The Industrial Complex consists of the Sugar Mill and structures G-J.
These buildings are larger than those surrounding
the Big House and are grouped in the general vicinity of the Sugar Mill. Structures A-E, and the Big
House from the Home Compound, the Sugar Mill,
and structure I of the Industrial Complex, have all
been excavated to some degree. At this time, structure B has been explored more thoroughly than any
other building. For that reason, the ceramic assemblage from structure B can be viewed with more
dependence than the other less completely investigated structures.

THE CERAMICS
The site's ceramics are typed by body color,
then sorted by decoration. Each sherd is tested for
vitreousity by absorption and light penetration
(Majewski and O'Brien 1987:113). The minimum
vessel count is then established based upon the
number of different rim sherds and basal fragments.
Also assigned vessel numbers are the decorated
sherds that obviously belong to vessels other than
those represented by the rims and bases. Next, recognized vessel forms are ascribed.

Using this information, the vessels are
attributed to a particular time period using the
median date of production. The mean date allows
attribution of a greater percentage of the ceramic
vessel collection. This is particularly the case for
the porcelains, which have enjoyed a lengthy
production period and popularity. Without marks,
temporal attribution of porcelain is very nearly
impossible. The 1800+ ceramic sherds from the
site represent a minimum of 283 vessels. This
includes sherds from 24 vessels without
provenience; these ceramic vessels are not reflected
in the percentages cited throughout this paper, and
are not discussed further.
Within the previously mentioned buildings,
there are 259 vessels. Featuring a number of decorative techniques, 202 are white-bodied earthenware or porcelain. A few redwares and yellow
wares, and many more stonewares, are also in the
collection. The Jackson period accounts for 75 vessels; 170 vessels are from the convict-labor period;
and a minimum of seven can be attributed to the
park period. Another seven vessels lack traits that
would allow for their temporal attribution, although
two can be recognized for form or use (one is a
tableware, the other a teaware). These unattributed
vessels represent 3 percent of the assemblage.
The British dominated the world ceramics market from late in the 18th century through most of
the 19th century (Majewski and O'Brien 1987: 114).
Nevertheless, upon their arrival in America in the
17th century, colonists immediately searched out
and settled in locales compatible with the maintenance of pottery kilns (McConnell 1988: 18). They
needed access to fuel and appropriate clays as well
as transportation venues. The first American efforts
were directed towards the production of red-bodied
wares, and American potters soon commanded the
redware market.
Porous if left unglazed and basically rather
fragile, redware generally takes the form of preparation and storage vessels, as do the three redware
vessels recovered, all at the home compound. These
vessels all date to the Jackson or slave-labor period
since, according to Ketchum (1983), virtually all
commercial redware production in the United States
had ceased by the mid-19th century.
Except in structure I in the industrial complex,
stoneware was recovered from every structure on
the site, albeit in small numbers. Some crocks, large
mixing bowls, several ginger beer bottles, and at

Pollan least one jug were recognizable among the 38
stoneware vessels. Chiefly produced for use in the
kitchen and pantry, stoneware vessels are typically
heavy and bulky, designed for usefulness rather
than beauty. Much hardier than redware, stoneware
is virtually watertight once it is fired, but most is
glazed anyway (Ketchum 1983:19). Two stoneware
marks were identified, both American, one of which
(the Western Stoneware Company mark) dates to
after 1906 (Lehner 1988: 513-514, Mark 13). The
Macomb Pottery mark dates from ca. 1890-1906
when Macomb was bought out and his pottery
incorporated into the previously mentioned
company (Lehner 1988:274). Of the 38 stoneware
vessels, 12 can be attributed to the Jackson period
and 26 to the convict-labor period.
Yellow ware, the next and largest American
ceramic endeavor, is lighter weight than stoneware, yet far more durable than redware. The
Americans' installation of gas-fired kilns in the
1870s wrote finis to England's dominance in this
particular market (Leibowitz 1985:9). Principally
produced in useful kitchenware and toiletware,
most yellow ware is porous and therefore requires
a glaze. This type of ceramic has been formed in
molds since the late 1830s, and any decoration is
added prior to applying the final colorless glaze
(Gallo 1985:39). Of the five major decorative
styles usually applied, only mocha motifs and flint
enamels are lacking on the nine vessels recovered,
none of which bears a mark (Gallo 1985:41). Both
styles of Rockingham glaze (dipped and spattered); relief-molded bodies; colorless glaze; and
slip bands occur on such items as large bowls, a
spittoon, and a chamber pot. Relief molding became popular late in the 19th century (McAllister
and Michel 1993:31), while slip banding occurred
on vessels dating from ca. 1850 and continued
well into the 20th century (Gallo 1985:42). By the
1870s, there were very few potters who were not
using Rockingham glazes on their yellow-bodied
products (Leibowitz 1985:14).
A fourth ceramic category, porcelain, makes
up approximately 12 percent of the LJSAL ceramics.
Over half of the 27 porcelain vessels recovered are
from the Big House, but they are distributed in
every structure except structure I in the Industrial
Complex. Structures A and the Big House also
have bone china. This form of porcelain, softerbodied and more translucent, became the standard
English porcelain body early in the 19th century

The China Cabinet at the Jackson Plantation

513

(Majewski and O'Brien 1987:127). It was marketed
not as bone china but as porcelain and exhibits
various types of on-glaze decoration. The remainder
of the porcelain vessels (n=20 vessels) consist of
hard paste porcelain. Few are recognizable by form,
with the exception of at least one parian (unglazed)
figurine, a souvenir mug, and one dinner plate.
The fifth ceramic type is refined white-bodied
earthenware. The English truly controlled the market for this particular class of ceramics. It was not
until the late 19th century that sufficient renovation
enabled most American potteries to profitably produce the much higher firing white-bodied ceramics
(Majewski and O'Brien 1987:103). Many years of
experimentation ensued to perfect the product as
well as persuade the home market to rely upon their
compatriots for the ceramics they used in their
homes. American potters enjoyed greater success
marketing their products by applying counterfeit
English marks on them (Majewski and O'Brien
1987:166). In the 1897 Sears, Roebuck & Company catalogue, 16 of the proffered 17 whiteware
sets originated elsewhere (Israel 1993). Eleven of
16 sets advertised in the 1902 catalogue were produced in America (Gramercy Books 1993), and the
1908 version featured 17 sets, of which only five
were of American origin (Schroeder 1969).
Present throughout the site, whiteware (n=l 75
vessels) represents 68 percent of the entire ceramic
assemblage. These vessels take the forms of tableware, teaware, and utilitarian kitchenware and
toiletware, with greater numbers of teaware. Fiftytwo whiteware vessels date to the Jackson era; 118
others date to the convict-labor period; and five
date to the park period.
The site's whitewares are sorted by decorative
style as defined by George L. Miller (1980, 1991)
in his cost indices for the classification and economic scaling of English ceramics. Miller's scheme
applies only to those whitewares marketed prior to
1870, essentially the Jackson or slave-labor period.
This is due to insufficient contemporary data, both
here and abroad, to formulate price scaling of ceramics marketed after the Civil War. Table 1 illustrates the four basic classifications of these wares,
based upon ceramic costs as fixed by the manufacturers themselves. The descriptive terminology used
here, and by Miller, originates with the potters as
well and reflects the way each style was marketed
in the 19th century. CC (cream-colored) is undecorated non-vitreous white earthenware that after 1820

Secondary, or overglaze, decoration includes
enamel, luster, gilt, decal, and engobes (Majewski
and O'Brien 1987:164). "White granite" refers to
what has also been called "ironstone" or "classic
ironstone"; that is, the plain all-white dishes that
emerged ca. 1840 and dominated the ceramic market from 1850-1890 (Figure 1).
Regardless of their lack of applied decoration,
white granites were costlier to produce than even
the expensive transfer-printed dishes. To a large
degree, this was due to the longer, higher firing
necessary to produce the vitreous English white
granite of the 1840s-1860s. By 1877, a nonvitreous white granite was being produced by
decreasing the final firing time, thus reducing
production costs and lowering prices (Miller

Of the 259 vessels, 74 percent had recognizable vessel forms. These 193 vessels include: 28
percent tableware, 44 percent teaware, 25 percent
kitchenware, and 3 percent toiletware.
Tableware, teaware, and kitchenware was
present throughout the site. Toiletware was recovered from the home compound only. Tableware
consisted of 54 vessels, while there were 85 teaware
vessels, 49 kitchenware vessels, and five toiletware

vessels. The industrial complex accounted for only
19 of the vessels: six tableware, seven teaware,
four kitchenware, and two unrecognizable for form
or use.
About 70 percent of the 175 white earthenware vessels are white granite; 29 percent are decorated, and the remainder (n=4 vessels) are totally
undecorated cream-colored (CC), the cheapest white
ceramic available. The three shell edge plates, the
nine cut-sponge stamped teas (cups and saucers),
and three annular "dipt" bowls comprise the next
category, the cheapest decorated wares.
Decoration requiring a higher level of expertise, the monochrome and polychrome brush-painted
wares (Figure 2), appear in the moderate cost category (see Table 1). They amount to six vessels.
These include "thick-line" motifs that cover the
greater part of each vessel and can be dated by the
colors present. Sprig, another painted style involving hairline stems (usually black) with tiny leaves
and blossoms, covers much less of the surface of
the one saucer found. One other example combines
characteristics of both thick-line and thin-line painting and dates to the same general time period, ca.
1840-1860 (Majewski and O'Brien 1987:157). Also
produced during that time are four of the nine cutsponge teas. These four teawares, with simple cutsponge motifs with no additional embellishment,
were from structures A, B, and the Big House. The
"ghost" of the fugitive enamel patterns, both floral,
precludes assigning specific dates. At least one is a
teaware, and most likely the other one is as well
(Miller 1996). These overglaze treatments may indicate that the popular "china painting" hobby was
employed by one of the residents during the period
1880-1905 (Majewski and O'Brien 1987: 154).
Transferwares, the costliest dishes during the
majority of the Jackson period, account for 15 vessels, of which three of the print-decorated vessels
are flown (Figure 3). Ordinarily, transferwares simply have a printed pattern applied, then are dipped
in a lead glaze after which they undergo a very high
firing in the glost oven, thus fusing the lead glaze to
the surface of the vessel (Coysh and Henrywood
1982:8). This glass finish serves to protect the decoration from wear for eternity or until the vessel or
glaze is broken. Applying this type of decoration
requires skill and delicacy to prevent smearing the
design or tearing the tissue upon which the pattern
is printed. The "flown" variety of transfer-print
decoration, or painting for that matter, includes the

516

Texas Archeological Society

introduction of lime or ammonium chloride into the
glost kiln during the final firing (in some cases,
much like salt is thrown into the kiln for salt glazing). The chemical creates an atmosphere in the
kiln in which the print bleeds into the glaze rather
than the glaze sitting atop the print. This creates a
halo effect, diffusing the pattern and "leaking" pigment into the colorless glaze (Coysh and
Henrywood 1982:140). Flown prints were most
popular ca. 1835-1870 (Coysh and Henrywood
1982: 10), but enjoyed a resurgence towards the
tum of the 20th century (Snyder 1992:7). Some
painted wares were treated in the same manner
(Miller 1991:8).
OCCUPATION PERIODS
Glory Days: Jackson Plantation
or Slave-Labor Period
The Jackson era ceramics consist of 10
stonewares, three redwares, and four yellow wares,
all of which are kitchenware and toiletwares. Fiftytwo whitewares, of which 22 are vitreous white
granite, and three porcelains (including two bone
china teas), date to this same period. Decorated
whitewares include monochrome and polychrome
broadline paint, sprig paint, edgeware, enamel, and
print (both regular and flown). All four CC vessels
found at the site date to the slave-labor period.
No marks appear on any of the flown sherds,
nor are any of them large enough to identify the
pattern. The regularly printed sherds yielded three
marks, one maker/pattern, one pattern, and one
importer's mark. The maker/pattern mark is for the
pattern Palestine produced, in this case, by William
Adams & Sons, 1819-present (Pollan et al. 1996:59).
Godden (1991:21, mark 22) dates the mark type to
ca. 1819-1864. Because the color is brown, this
vessel was not produced prior to 1828 (Hughes and
Hughes 1968:151).
The second pattern mark is one for the Scotts
Illustrations series produced between ca. 18351860 by Davenport, who operated from 1794-1887
(Lockett and Godden 1989:73). This particular vessel features The Legend of Montrose as its central
view. The pattern of the hollow vessel on which
we find the Henderson & Gaines import mark
cannot be identified. Henderson & Gaines, only
one of several New Orleans import partnerships,
operated between 1836 and 1867 (Black and
Brandimarte 1987).

The estate sale of 1863 does not describe the
dishes sold at that time. With the exception of the
"sett china ... $28.00" that refers to porcelain, there
is no way of knowing what kind of dishes were
sold (BCC 1863: PR:C627, Case 764). It would be
helpful to know how early in the 19th century white
granite became the ceramic of choice on the Gulf
Coast. At Lake Jackson, white granite represents
70 percent of the whitewares. Eighteen percent of
the white granite is vitreous, suggesting it probably
belonged to the Jackson's and was used during the
slave-labor period. These heavy thick-walled vessels sport octagonal and hexagonal shapes, some
with naturalistic relief molding, some simply plain,
but nowhere nearly as plain as white granite would
become later in the century (Majewski and O'Brien
1987:154).
Under New Management:
Convict-Labor Period
Post-Civil War ceramics are dominated by
white granite as well. A few decorated items appear, but of the 118 whiteware vessels attributed to
the convict-labor period, white granite makes up 85
percent. By 1870, white granite shapes began to
soften, and round shapes appeared. Body walls began to thin and the body color evolved into a creamy
rather than bluish or grayish white (Majewski and
O'Brien 1987; Wetherbee 1980). By ca. 1877, nonvitreous white granite was also produced.
Among the few decorated vessels attributed to
the convict-labor period are one transfer-print; two
cut-sponge teas of the "Portneuf' variety; two opensponge decorated vessels; three band and line teas;
and two Tea Leaf teas. The aforementioned decorative techniques can be found applied to white granite as well, but once decorated, white granite is
classified by its decoration just as is whiteware
(Miller 1993:4).
The later transfer-printed designs differ from
earlier styles. For instance, much less of the vessel
was decorated and the palette was limited to brown,
navy blue, and sometimes, black. Central scenes
were minimized, if not completely eliminated, at
least until Japanese patchwork designs appeared.
Some vessels were printed in outlines to be filled in
later with color (Coysh and Henrywood 1982;
Wetherbee 1985) .
Open sponge decoration, the style still applied
to stonewares today, originated in 1860 and was

Pollan used until 1935. It appeared on tableware and
kitchenware made of whiteware as well as stoneware and was produced by both American and British potteries. This technique involves "stamping"
color onto a vessel using a natural sponge dipped in
paint. This differs from cut sponge in that the process was the same but used shapes cut from the
more compact stems of the sponge. Open sponge
applications often overlap colors while spatter and
cut sponge usually segregate the colors more into
patterns (Majewski and O'Brien 1987:162). Two
examples (one open sponge cup and one unknown
form) are present at the plantation.
What we know as Tea Leaf is actually "Lustre
Band and Sprig," a decorative style introduced by
Anthony Shaw ca. 1850 (Heaivilin 1981:108) but
not perfected until the late 1870s (Figure 4). The
process consists of first painting a motif (or the
vessel's relief-molded design) in a base color of
greenish-brown, glazing and firing the vessel, and
then applying a coat of lustre just upon the painted
design. Even though the luster is then "set" in an
oven, the polished copper finish is vulnerable to
regular use. For this reason, many 19th century
examples evidence no luster at all. The improvement developed by Shaw ca. 1870 enabled the potters to apply the luster under the glaze, thus
protecting it as well as the underlying painted motif
(Wetherbee 1980: 123). One of the plantation's two
Tea Leaf examples is shiny and lustrous, the other
is bilious brown. Usually this dull brown would be
a temporal indicator, but not in this case. The bilious saucer has a maker mark, W.H. Grindley (England, 1880-present) dating this teaware to
1891-1925 (Godden 1991:294).

Figure 4. This Lustre Band and Sprig, or Tea Leaf, motif
adorns a saucer recovered in Structure C of the Home
Compound.

Another decorative style that emerged very
late in the 19th century is band and line decoration.
Usually brown, green, or blue, the application involves painting a tiny stripe or line parallel to and
very near the edge of a vessel, then adding a
slightly broader band next to it. This banded ware
is the precursor of the heavy striped hotel-wares
(Miller 1991 :7).
Portneuf-type cut-sponge decoration originated
in England or Scotland ca. 1840 and was exported
into the 1920s. The decoration consists of brightly
colored cut-sponge motifs with brushed or sponged
bands of vibrant colors (Majewski and O'Brien
1987:162). Several vessels with this decoration, all
teaware, occur at the plantation but are confined to
the residential compound.

Rest and Relaxation or
The Park Period
Not long before the emergence of band and
line ceramics, decalcomania made its appearance
in America. Imported primarily in porcelain, very
few earthenware examples appeared before the turn
of the 20th century. Decal-decorated wares remained
popular well into the 1950s. For this reason, the
median date falls within the park period rather than
the convict-labor period. Although decal printing
was available in America as early as 1894 (Downes
1994:68), it was not economically feasible for potters to use American-made decals until the 1930s.
Decals are often combined with relief molding and,
more particularly, gilding. They are applied onglaze and are subject to wear. Often all that is left is
a ghostly outline that can be felt with the fingertips.
They are generally floral motifs with distinctive
shading; the earliest decals were monochrome, and
later they were multi-colored. Another type of decal involves outline art that is later filled in with
color and is often confused with the earlier transfer-printed outlines that have been enameled between the lines (Majewski and O'Brien
1987:146-147).
Other than hundreds of white sherds that may
represent undecorated portions of any number and
style of different vessels, there remains only the
infamous engobe to be accounted for, otherwise
known as Fiestaware. Created in 1935 by Homer
Laughlin & Co. (Lehner 1988:248), Fiesta livened
up the tables of America through 1972. It then enjoyed a revival in 1986. The opaque, colored all-

518

Texas Archeological Society

over glaze covering an ironstone body owed its
popularity to its bright colors and the play of light
on the art deco shapes and angles of the vessels.
At least three engobes occur at the plantation,
oddly enough all at the Big House. One is goldenrod yellow, one is a pastel blue, and one is pale
lemon yellow. The two yellow vessels are both
tablewares (Figure 5), one a plate and one a rectangular casserole or shallow serving dish. The pale
blue vessel is definitely a piece of hollowware with
a floral embossed pattern of daisies on its exterior
(unlike Fiesta that is typically very plain, relying
upon geometric vessel shape rather than embossing for its appeal). Naturally, these items fall into
the park period.

yellow-glazed rectangular dish lacks any embellishment
other than its all-over glaze and molded concentric lines.

COMPONENTS
While the ceramics from the home compound
run the gamut of types available for the different
occupations at the site, the industrial complex has
no toiletware but otherwise includes vessels one
would expect to find in a residential/industrial plant.
Markedly different, the park period with a mere
three percent of the site's ceramics graphically illustrates the effect of organized sanitation systems
upon the world we live in.

Home Compound
The Home Compound accounts for 93 percent
of the ceramics with 23 vessels from structure A,
35 from structure B, 10 from structure C, 46 from
structure D, and 115 from the Big House itself

(seven of which are undateable). Seven vessels were
recovered between the Big House and structures A
and B, while the walkway between structures A
and B yielded another four. All the ceramics are
consistent with food preparation and dining, with
the exception of the toiletware. Tableware amounted
to 27 percent; teaware, 45 percent; kitchenware, 25
percent; and three percent toiletware.
Structure A had moderately priced goods during the Jackson era and top-of-the-line goods during the convict-labor period. No park period
ceramics are present. This structure had no
toiletware, either personal or general. All 23 vessels were temporally attributable, but only 17 were
recognizable as to form or use.
Eighty-three percent of the Structure B vessels
were whiteware. All were dateable, and 27 were
recognizable in form or use. The range of ceramics
suggests this structure was inhabited throughout
the site's main occupations (no park period
ceramics). Slightly more than half of the ceramics
date to the convict-labor period. Both periods reflect
a wide variety of decorated ceramics, although the
convict-labor ceramics are not cost scaleable. Wares
range from a CC ointment pot, yellow ware and
stone kitchenwares, low to high-end decorated
ceramics for the table, and a Rockingham-glazed
spittoon. They exhibit a wide selection of decorative
styles, including three edgeware plates, several
printed items, and white granite plates. One of the
monochrome blue printed vessels (unidentified)
contains a William Adams & Sons mark dating to
1819-1864 (Godden 1991:21). Also present are a
dipt waste bowl (teaware), banded teaware, and
"Portneuf" -like cut-sponge tea ware; in fact,
teawares (37 percent) dominate the Structure B
assemblage.
Structure C, the small building on the edge of
the lake behind the Big House (see Few, this volume), has eight recognizable vessels: 25 percent
tableware, 25 percent teaware, and 50 percent
kitchenware. The four vessels from the Jackson era
are kitchenware except one unidentified printed
vessel. The postbellum wares consist of one stoneware hollow vessel, two white granite plates, and
two teawares, one of which is the bilious brown tea
leaf saucer.
Many more ceramic items were found at Structure D, a two-room building found during removal
of the road that forks around structure A and on
into the park. The recognizable wares from the

Pollan Jackson era include kitchen containers, two CC
ointment pots, and two teas: one printed and one
polychrome painted. Unidentified print vessels at
this structure include a Davenport pattern mark for
Legend of Montrose of the Scott's Illustrations series (Pollan et al 1996:68), a brown print cup, and a
flown black hollow receptacle. The 33 convict period vessels are dominated by white granite, both
tableware and teaware; two cut-sponge teas, a dipt
waste bowl, as well as three porcelain teas number
among them. The park period is represented by a
single unidentified porcelain vessel. In all, of the
46 vessels from Structure D, 35 were recognizable
by age and 44 classified by form/use. The two
unclassified items include two decalcomania examples; one of which is gilded.
The walkway excavations (originally known
as Structure E) between structures A and B recovered four vessels: a granite plate, a porcelain cup,
and two hollow stonewares. One stoneware is
wheel-thrown and one is mold-formed, dating it to
no earlier than the 1880s (Ketchum 1983:19). Except for the wheel-thrown stoneware, all date to the
convict-labor period.
No definite walkway patterns were found between the Big House and structures A and B, but
seven ceramic vessels were. One early hollow
redware vessel dates to the Jackson's' residency,
while the balance of the vessels-one stone
kitchenware and four white granites-date to after
the Jackson's' departure.
Within the confines of the Big House, ceramic
variety is the rule. Tradition has it that some walls
of the Big House were still standing when development of the park first began. In the process of
preparing a safe recreational area for the public,
those standing walls were pushed in and the building debris was consolidated into one large pile. At
some point a fence was added to prevent park visitors from climbing around among the crumbled
walls. No doubt refuse was tossed on the pile as
well, which may explain the presence of 20th century ceramics within an inaccessible area. A total of
115 vessels have been recovered in the investigation of the mansion. All but five vessels were datable, and 78 could be recognized for their use.
Tableware and teaware includes white granite (75
percent), painted, dipt, printed, enameled, gilded
and embossed, and 20th century engobes.

lot of dishes (meaning serving pieces), one lot of
plates, two large wasters and the aforementioned
set of porcelain, not to mention four pitchers, a
couple of wash stands with pitchers, a mug, and a
castor that may not have been ceramic. John, on the
other hand, acquired a soap dish and cup and nine
soup plates. These were the only family members
bidding, but five other bidders walked away with
"lots" of dishes, thus contributing just under $200
toward the settling of the estate (BCC 1863:
PR:C627, Case 764). This was at a time when a
203-piece dinner service cost less than Â£8 sterling
(Coysh and Henrywood 1982: 107).
Even given the auction, enough ceramic pieces
have been left in the ground before and since the
estate sale to consider the lifestyle of the Big House
occupants. One chamber pot (white granite) and
one CC ointment pot comprise the toiletware. Seventeen kitchenwares include one manganese-glazed
redware, twelve stoneware, and four yellow wares.
Both Albany and Bristol slip finishes and, of course,
salt glazes occur on the stonewares; a number of
the vessels are ginger beer bottles. One of the yellow wares is a large mixing bowl with bright blue
and white slip banding.
Jacksonian teaware (n=35 vessels) outnumber
tableware (n=24 vessels). Our only example of sprig
painting, a saucer, was found at the Big House as
was a thick-line motif vessel, two cut-sponge teas,
and all of the main house transfer-prints. These
prints include the blue-printed bowl with the
Henderson & Gaines import mark, the brownprinted Palestine vessel, a blue-printed plate, a redprinted sherd, a black all-over "marble" print, and a
purple-printed hollow ware handle. A dozen white
granites of various forms and a child's bone china
mug complete the picture for the Jackson era.
The last quarter of the 19th century includes
the use of 18 white granite and one porcelain plate.
This plate, one of 14 porcelain vessels, four of
which are bone china, attributed to this period,
echoes the white granite shapes of this period in its
simplicity and lack of decoration. One white granite
pattern, Nosegay, has been identified on an unknown
hollow vessel. Nosegay is a product of the E & C
Challinor pottery of Staffordshire, England, who
operated under this name from 1862-1891 (Godden
1991:137), but who only produced white granite
from 1850-1875 according to Heaivilin (1981). The
remainder of the white-bodied wares are teas: one
dipt, one banded, 19 plain white granite, and one

lustrous copper tea leaf cup. Four of the 14 porcelain
vessels from this period are bone china, most of
them undecorated, although one sports a gilded
ruffled rim. The stoneware from this period includes
a "moonshine" type jug with a white Bristol interior
and exterior and one ginger-beer bottle.
By far the largest segment of the Big House
ceramics (63 percent) are attributed to the convictlabor period. The park era has only 3.5 percent of
the vessels, including all three engobes and one
unidentified bone china vessel. This leaves five
vessels whose attribution to a single occupation
period cannot be made. These include one gilded
and embossed tea, three unknown porcelain vessels, and one enameled porcelain mug embellished
with the haunting legend, "remember me."
The residential compound comprises 93 percent of the total vessel count at the site (Table 2).
Ninety-seven percent of these vessels are datable,
and 73 percent are recognizable for form or function. All decorative styles previously described are
present as well as all of the possible vessel forms.
The Jackson era accounts for 26 percent of the
vessels from the site; the convict-labor interval, 62
percent; and the park term, 2 percent; leaving 3
percent in an "attribution unknown" category.

convict-labor period contributed 53 percent; and
the Jackson era, 37 percent. There were no decorated wares prior to the park period, and then, only
one unidentified decalcomania vessel.
The function of structure I is unknown, however, much livery furniture turned up as well as five
ceramic vessels. Two white granite tablewares date
from the Jackson era. One yellow ware and one
white granite tea date to the convict-labor period,
and the park era contributed one unknown decalcomania vessel produced by the French China Company of Sebring, Ohio from shortly before
1900-1916 (Lehner 1988:155).
The Sugar Mill ceramics with 14 vessels was
no more diverse than structure I. All the vessels
were temporally attributable, and 12 were recognizable by form or use. While staffed by criminals,
the mill's collection was dominated by white granite (63 percent) (Figure 6), but included two stone
kitchenwares-one a jug and one a ginger-beer
bottle-and a fluted porcelain teacup. While operated by slaves, the mill acquired four white granite
teawares and one kitchen stoneware vessel. One
unidentified decal-decorated vessel comprises the
park period collection at the Sugar Mill.

Industrial Complex
Prior to beginning the LJSAL excavation, not
much thought had been given to what type or form
of ceramics might occur within the industrial complex. Interviews conducted during the 1989 archeological survey suggested that the sugar house had
been occupied as a residency at one time by a
descendant of one of the original plantation slaves.
Found later were the reference to meals held during
the round-the-clock operation of mills at peak harvest time each year, and the inventory turned over
to the new owner when the property changed hands
in 1873 (Few 1995:3.22). The latter listed the dishes
used by all the convicts. No doubt one or more of
these events accounts for the variety of ceramics
recovered at the Industrial Complex.
The Industrial Complex ceramics make up 7
percent of the entire site collection. The 19 vessels comprise 26 percent tableware, 37 percent
teaware, and 21 percent kitchenware. No toiletware
has been recovered. The other 16 percent represent unrecognizable vessel forms. The park period
accounts for 10 percent of these ceramics; the

SUMMARY

The ceramic assemblage hints at the functions
of the Lake Jackson structures. As it stands today,
kitchenware occurred at every structure, yet dominated only the structures A and C collections.
Toiletwares appeared in very limited numbers and
only at structures B, D, and the Big House. With

only two exceptions, teaware consistently occurred
in greater numbers than tableware (Table 2).
As a Jackson holding, the full spectrum of
decorated whiteware appears at structures B, D,
and the Big House, with the most expensive styles
dominating in all cases. Only 22 white granite
vessels dating to this period were recovered, and
then only at the Big House, structure I, and the
Sugar Mill. Ointment pots are the only toiletwares
appearing from the slave-labor period. Teaware
dominated every structure except structures E and
I, where low sample sizes prevented functional
determinations. In fact, no teaware or kitchenware
occurred at structure I during the slave-labor period.

This same period evidences no tableware at
structures C, D, or the Sugar Mill.
The convict-labor period saw more parallels
between structures B, D, and the Big House. White
granite, the ceramic style of choice and the most
expensive, dominated every structure until the style
was superseded by elaborate decorative styles such
as decalcomania. Where there is decorated
whiteware, however, it is either the cheapest (dipt
or cut-sponge) or the latest and greatest (tea leaf
and banded) style available; the decorated vessels
are always tea wares. No kitchenware occurs at
structure B during this period and no tableware was
present at structure I. The only toiletware recovered

522

Texas Archeological Society

is one yellow ware spittoon at structure B and one
white granite chamber pot at the Big House.
By dint of their long popularity, the median
date for decalcomania falls within the park period.
Some of it probably pertains to the convict-labor
period, but some, no doubt, represents the owner's
less valuable dinnerware used on a picnic at the
park. By the 1940s and 1950s, this decorative style
had become quite affordable and was gradually declining in popularity. None of the decalcomania is
recognizable by form, and no kitchenware occurs
in this period. Two of the three engobes from this
period are tableware, but the other is unidentified.
Besides the establishment of waste management systems, the paper and plastic goods designed
specifically for recreational meals eventually had
an immense effect upon the material recovery or
lack thereof for the park period. Nevertheless, humans continue to eat, sleep, excrete, and create
trash, and will forever leave material remnants of
some sort to betray their presence, if only for the
landfill archeologists of the future.

The Vertebrates from Lake Jackson
State Archeological Landmark

W. L. McClure

ABSTRACT

Recent excavations at Lake Jackson State Archeological Landmark yielded more than 17,000 elements of
vertebrate animals. Bones of native and introduced animals may have accumulated at the site in prehistoric times,
during construction and operation of the plantation and sugar mill, after they were abandoned, and when the site
became a public park. The vertebrate remains were examined to help determine cultural activities during
particular occupation intervals at the various structures.

INTRODUCTION
The Lake Jackson State Archeological
Landmark (4lBO172) is in Lake Jackson, Brazoria
County, Texas, on the banks of Lake Jackson. It is
the location of a plantation and sugar mill that were
constructed and operated in the last half of the 19th
century. Operations ceased on the property when
the structures were severely damaged by the 1900
hurricane, and they remained unused until a public
park was developed there in 1945. This development
included the major movement of soil, rubble, and
archeological materials about the site.
Archeological testing and excavations were
carried out at the Lake Jackson site from 19911996 during University of Houston at Clear Lake
classes and during the 1995 and 1996 Texas
Archeological Society field schools, all under the
direction of Joan Few. This work documented a
prehistoric occupation; a pre-Civil War sugar and
cotton plantation; a post-Civil War sugar mill run
by convict labor; and after a 45-year hiatus, a 20th
century park. The remains of vertebrates that were
recovered during excavations at Lake Jackson have
been identified to the extent possible to determine
if information concerning cultural activities during
the four episodes of site occupation could be
ascertained.
In addition to excavations at the various
structures, areas between several of the structures

were tested, and the matrix from some of these tests
were fine-screened. Numerous fragments of marine
mollusks, including complete gastropod shells, were
common, and these appear comparable to materials
found on the beach of the Gulf of Mexico. The
mollusks were probably brought to the site for
stabilization of the roadway.

FORMATION PROCESSES
Park development activities would have fractured bones and mixed them, as well as artifacts,
from different areas and strata. This made it necessary to search for evidence of disturbance and alteration of the bone sample before attempting to assign
vertebrate remains to a particular structure or occupational episode.
Many things can and do happen to bones
between the time that they are part of a living animal
and the time they are examined by a faunal analyst.
Animals that are raised or acquired for food
purposes are butchered with various different parts
being discarded or used for non-food purposes from
one culture to another. From personal experience I
know that the heads, tails, and lower parts of legs
of game animals are often left at the kill site. Some
hunters take home only the breast of game birds.
Fish are often beheaded and filleted in the field.
The bones from the spare parts would not be in the

refuse around the cooking place. Butchering
separates bones from each other and reduces some
bones to parts, depending on the intended cooking
process. Various bones or parts of bones may be
distributed to other households before or after
cooking. The method of cooking will leave some
bones more subject to decomposition than others.
Disposal of bones and other refuse after food
consumption will differ between various groups and
from different circumstances. Cooking will seldom
cause the bones to be burned completely, although
the ends and edges may show signs of exposure to
fire. Wild fires through a disposal area will bum the
edges and upper surfaces of bones more than the
lower parts. A mixture of burned and unburned
bone at one place is an indication that some mixing
has occurred since the primary disposal of the bones.
Disposal of the inedible parts of the animals and
the bones after consumption is also variable, and
pet dogs can be involved in the breakage and scattering of bones.
Traffic by vehicles, animals, and humans can
fragment and disperse bones. The recent construction of the park road and ditch at Lake Jackson
would have fragmented and rearranged the bones
and artifacts. Fragmentation and degradation of
bones also occurs in the soil due to chemical actions, moisture changes, and the activities of fossorial animals. Excavation, screening, washing, and
transport during archeological activities also impact the bone assemblage.
Bones recovered in archeological contexts may
also be indicative of natural deaths of domestic
stock or wild animals. Consumption by carnivores
and scavengers leaves bones in different conditions
than would consumption by raptors or reptiles.

RESULTS OF THE FAUNAL
ANALYSIS
There are 17,459 vertebrate remains in the assemblage, including bones, bone fragments, fish
scales, and bird egg shell fragments (Table 1). Most
of the bones are incomplete, but their condition is
good. Of these, 42 percent are too fragmentary to
identify beyond unidentified vertebrate. Of the
l 0, 111 elements that have been identified, 50 percent are fish, less than 1 percent are amphibians, 6
percent are reptiles, 6 percent are birds, and 38
percent are mammals (see Table 1).

Eleven varieties of fishes are identified. This
includes three coastal marine fishes (gafftopsail catfish, sea catfish, and sheepshead) and freshwater
species that are native to the area and are probably
in Lake Jackson today (Hubbs 1982). Gar (n=2436)
appears to be the dominant fish. Only 19 of the gar
elements are vertebrae and cranial bones, while the
rest are scales that are resistant to degradation and
more apt to be preserved than other bones. Bones
of largemouth bass, sunfish, and freshwater catfish
are present in larger numbers than freshwater drum
and smallmouth buffalo. Unidentified fish remains
include 1863 scales, 92 vertebrae, and a few other
parts. Less than 2 percent of these are from fish as
small as a four inch-long sunfish or as large as an
18 inch-long bass, while the remainder are from
fish between those lengths.
There are four varieties of amphibians in the
sample. Bullfrogs, leopard frogs, tree frogs, and
toads are common in the area today (Dixon 1987).
Reptiles are represented by alligator, six kinds
of turtles, two kinds of lizards, and three kinds of
snakes. The slider is the most plentiful turtle in the
assemblage. The others are snapping turtle, mud
turtle, stinkpot, box turtle, and softshell. The lizards include green anole and ground skink. The
snake species are rat snake, kingsnake, and water
snake. All of these reptiles are currently common
in and around Lake Jackson (Dixon 1987).
Twenty-two varieties of birds are identified,
both migratory and resident. Migratory birds include cormorant, wigeon, teal, shoveler, mallard,
gadwall, Canada goose, snow goose, ruddy duck,
hawk, sanderling, mourning dove, brown thrasher,
meadowlark, and grosbeak (Teres 1980). Among
the resident birds are little blue heron, yellowcrowned night heron, turkey, blue jay, and mockingbird. Domestic duck and domestic chicken are
introduced species. The unidentifiable bones range
in size from ducks and chickens to turkey. Egg
shell fragments are comparable in size and texture
to chicken eggs.
Thirty-one kinds of mammals are represented
in the Lake Jackson bones. The only migratory
mammal is a hoary bat. Resident native mammals
include oppossum, short-tailed shrew, least shrew,
armadillo, swamp rabbit, cottontail, gray squirrel,
fox squirrel, pocket gopher, beaver, harvest mouse,
pigmy mouse, white-footed mouse, rice rat, hispid
cotton rat, woodrat, raccoon, mink, skunk, bobcat,
and deer (Davis and Schmidly 1994). Domestic

mammals include dog, cat, pig, cow, and horse.
Introduced rodents include house mouse, Norway
rat, and black rat. One human specimen is a tooth
with a large cavity.
Because there are no unquestionable bison
bones at the site, and there is little possibility of
there having been bison in Brazoria County at the
time of the historic occupation, large bovid bones
are probably all of domestic cow (see Table 1). The
fragments of bones of cow-size mammals are also
likely from cows. Since 13 times as many pig bones
as deer bones were identified, it is probable that
most of the pig/deer-size bones are of pigs.

The considerable vertical and horizontal
distribution of gar and armadillo remains, and their
mixture with prehistoric materials, indicates that
much of the excavated deposits at Structure A have
been brought in from other locations. Its origin is
probably as refuse from butchering, along with the
consumption of pig and cattle and a few wild
species. This refuse apparently has accumulated on
an area that has evidence of prehistoric occupation.
Remains of non-domestic animals may have been
added at the same place during post-1900 activities.
The major movement of the deposits occurred after
1900, probably during preparation of the park
grounds.

Structure A
Structure A was built during the post-Civil
War era. It may have been a storage building.
Potential food resources in the fauna are fish,
turtle, duck, rabbit, deer, pig, and cow. Of these
animals, most of the recovered materials are from
non-edible parts. The pig bones include teeth, cranial fragments, and foot bones; five of the pig long
bones were sawed for steaks. The cattle bones include many teeth and several foot bones. Six of the
cow bones have been sawed; one is a sirloin steak
and another is a chuck roast cut. Other pig and cow
bones have been hacked with a cleaver or heavy
knife, and vertebrae have been severed longitudinally during butchering. Animal bones that are
probably not related to food consumption include
snake, armadillo, rat, cat, and bobcat.
The distribution of the armadillo bones provides clues concerning past site disturbances. Its
203 bones are scattered in many different levels of
many excavation units, but are probably from the
same individual. As the armadillo first entered Texas
after 1900 (Davis and Schmidly 1994), this particular armadillo died sometime after termination of
the sugar mill operations and prior to the park construction. Another clue to disturbances is the 1548
gar scales (probably from the same fish) that are
scattered in several levels and units, some of which
also include armadillo bones.
Burned bones are in many levels and units,
and comprise 11 percent of the bones (excluding
gar scales) in these contexts. These levels also
include gar scales, armadillo bones, and prehistoric
artifacts. Below the mixed zone are pig bones
sawed for steaks.

Structure B
Structure B was constructed prior to the Civil
War, when the plantation and sugar mill were in
operation. It served as a domestic residence and
perhaps as a jail (see Few, this volume).
The identifiable non-domestic bones include
non-edible parts of fish, alligator, and deer along
with mostly non-edible parts of turtles, birds, opossum, and rabbits. The chicken, pig, and cow bones
include both edible and non-edible parts. Three pig
bones have been sawed for steaks, and 17 of the
cow bones are sawed; none of the pig and cow
vertebrae have been longitudinally severed.
There is a low percent of burned bones at
Structure B, indicating some movement of the
remains subsequent to their initial disposal.
However, the most notable feature of the bones is
the preponderance of rodents, including numerous
bones of native and introduced rats. This may
represent a period when owls dropped the bones
within regurgitated pellets in or at that building.
The rodent bones are scattered both vertically and
horizontally in most of the excavated area. This
distribution could not have occurred from owl
droppings with walls standing while nearly five
feet of debris accumulated. This suggests that the
soil containing the rodent bones has been
thoroughly mixed and is from another source.
There also are many gar scales and opossum bones
(probably from one individual each) scattered
throughout the same areas to further suggest
mixing by agents other than scavengers. Prehistoric
artifacts are present with and above these same
remains. It is likely that the majority of the

McClure -

The Vertebrates from Lake Jackson State Archeological Landmark 531

excavated material at Structure B represents
materials from a source that includes a standing
structure that had been used by owls.
There is some indication that portions of the
lower deposits in the northeast comer of room C
next to the hearth may not have been disturbed. The
presence of edible and non-edible parts of bones of
domestic stock as well as fish, turtles, rodents, and
wild game suggest that room C may have been a
work area as well as a living space. However, there
are numerous rodent bones in the corner of the
room, suggesting it may have been the drop zone
for owl pellets. This further suggests that the mixed
material from much of Structure B has been reworked by the bulldozers rather than having been
brought from a distance.
Consideration of the vertebrate remains from
Structure B indicates that almost all of the excavated matrix has been disturbed during the park
construction. Prior to that event, Structure B was
used as a dump for food processing, and at a different time part of the structure was still standing and
used by owls as a roost. Hunters and fishermen
may have field-dressed their game and fish at the
site after 1900.

Structure D
Structure D was built after the Civil War. It
was used as a residence, and perhaps for functions
related to running the mill. A part of room A appeared to have been undisturbed by park construction activities.
Bones of fish, turtles, wild ducks, rabbits, and
squirrels, are common in the assemblage from Structure D. However, rodent bones are more plentiful.
Levels 3 and 4 contain 94 percent of the rodent
bones, and these probably represent the surface in
room A between the time of the 1900 hurricane and
1945 park construction. Part of the structure must
have been still standing and served as a perch for
owls. The fish and game animal bones may reflect
disposal during the same interval by local people.
The bones include representative elements of edible and non-edible portions of domestic and game
animals. Food preparation as well as consumption
may have occurred in the room. The ratio of bones
of fish, birds, rabbits, pigs, deer, and cows at Structure D is comparable to the array of bones from the
overseer's house at Eagle Island Plantation (Gross

et al. 1993). Eagle Island Plantation (41B0141) is
the next plantation downstream from the Lake Jackson Plantation.

Main House
The Main House was built in 1851 by Abner
Jackson. It served as a residence for the owners
and/or managers during the time the plantation and
sugar mill were operational (see Few, this volume).
More vertebrate remains have been recovered
from the Main House than from any other structure
(see Table 1). Bones of cows and pigs are equally
represented, along with chicken. Deer and turkey
indicate the hunting of larger game, but fish, turtles,
birds, rabbits, and squirrels are also prominent. The
bones of fish, and domestic and game animals, are
distributed in all excavated areas. Rodent bones are
numerous, although they are not found on the east
side of the house. This concentration on the west
side-with 91 percent in levels 3 and 4-suggests
that owls may have been using the house or nearby
trees for roosts. The bones from the Main House,
although of unknown source, appear to represent
one or more locations where wild fish and game,
and domestic stock, have been processed, consumed, and the refuse discarded.
Sugar Mm
The Sugar Mill structure was built and partially rebuilt during the occupation of the site by
the Jacksons and later owners. Its purpose was to
convert sugar cane into sugar and molasses.
At the Sugar Mill, a few bones of chickens,
pigs, and cows have been recovered as well as
bones of fish, turtle, birds, and small mammals.
The bones from all parts of the bodies of domestic
ducks, rabbits, skunks, and cats are scattered about
the excavated area. This array of bone appears to
be typical of natural scavenging activities rather
than wholesale disturbance by human activities. It
is unlikely that cats and domestic ducks were in the
area before the park was established. The fish and
rabbit bones may have been discarded at the same
time. Thus, it appears that the deposits around the
Sugar Mill have not been as extensively disturbed
as some of the other structures. An ischium of a
pig, a cow tibia, and a cow thoracic vertebra are
the only bones that have been sawed.

Structures C, E, I, and Areas
between Structures
The numbers and kinds of bones recovered in
the other structures, as well as in the various excavations outside of the structures, are not useful in
resolving questions about the past use of the site.
These excavations have only between 24-397 bones
per area (see Table 1).

SUMMARY
A large number of bones of vertebrates were
recovered during the Lake Jackson excavations.
These bones probably accumulated in several distinct intervals: (1) prior to the arrival of Europeans;
(2) during construction and operation of the plantation and sugar mill; (3) after the structures were
abandoned following destruction of some of them
by the 1900 hurricane; and (4) after establishment
of a park on the site. Major alterations of the structures and sediments occurred at the beginning of
the final interval.
Domestic fowl, stock, and pets (other than possibly dogs) would not have been present during the
first interval. Chickens, pigs, and cattle would have
been raised for consumption during the second interval, while rodents and insectivore bones would
have accumulated at the partially demolished structures during the third interval. Bones of fish and
game animals would be expected during each interval. Armadillos would not have been there before
the third interval.
Study of the bones indicates that domestic stock,
fish, and wild animals were butchered and consumed on the grounds. Bones were discarded with
only a small percentage being burned. Casual acquisition and consumption of fish and game animals,

and the discarding of their bones, occurred after the
mill and residences were abandoned. Major disturbance of the area during park construction mixed
the sediments and cultural debris, after which there
was a limited accumulation of fish and game fauna.
Because of the major disturbance known to
have taken place during creation of the park, little
of the fauna was considered to have come from
sufficiently undisturbed contexts to segregate
associated groups of animal remains that could be
attributed to a particular temporal interval.
Additional information about the specific food
habits of the people that lived at Lake Jackson can
only be ascertained when undisturbed areas can be
found and excavated.

Texas' Early Sugar Industry: A Comparative Study of Four
Antebellum Sugar Mills in Brazoria County, Texas
Joan Few

ABSTRACT
Between 1828 and 1861, approximately 40 sugar plantations and mills were constructed in the lower Brazos
River valley of Texas, producing millions of pounds of granulated sugar and thousands of barrels of molasses
each year. No blueprints or documents have been found that describe in detail the construction of these mills.
This article compares the information obtained through archeological research on four Texas sugar mill ruins
that have identified architectural features which reveal patterns in the components and configuration of the sugar
refining process.

INTRODUCTION
Columbus brought cuttings of sugar cane to
Wes
tern Hemisphere on his second voyage. He
the
planted it in Santo Domingo in what is now the
Dominican Republic. The first sugar mill in the
Western Hemisphere was built in 1508 in Isabela, a
village near Santo Domingo.
After his conquest of Mexico, Hernando Cortes
established two plantations. From these beginnings,
the cultivation of sugar cane spread to Brazil, Peru,
and Argentina. By the mid-1600s, tropical America
became the greatest sugar-producing area in the
world (Pennington 1977:768).
Moses Austin, an impresario in Spanish Texas
in 1820, stated to the Spanish governor at San Antonio that "it was his intention to provide for his
subsistence by raising sugar and cotton" (Creighton
1975:196). The Spanish governor must have been
aware that sugar cane would grow in Texas because a sugar mill was established by 1755 at Mission San Jose y San Miguel de Aguayo in San
Antonio (Clark 1976:245).
Yldephonso Marmolejo, in an inventory of
Mission San Jose in 1755, "described the ingenio
at the mission as being 15 varas long, 6 112 varas
wide roofed with tule or native cane. It had wooden
moledoras for crushing the cane, three cauldrons
for boiling the syrup and a trough for conducting
the syrup from the mill to the vats" (Clark
1976:247). An inventory made by Governor

Manuel Munoz in 1794 listed a water mill to grind
the cane, and he described the mill as "a vat of
masonry with a metal basal grate weighing 338.9
pounds for the cooking of sugar cane syrup to make
sugar cones." Munoz also noted that 207, 186 sugar
canes were grown in 186 rows in four fields (Clark
1976:247).
This type of sugar mill compares in size and
processing with other small 18th and 19th century
mills used to process cane and sorghum in Texas,
Georgia, and Mexico. The differences between the
small mill at Mission San Jose and the industrial
mills that developed in the 19th century in the
Brazos River area of Texas include the size of the
mills; the quantities of sugar produced; the quality
of the sugar produced in the industrial process; and
the world market of the industrial mills compared
to the domestic market of the San Jose mill.
After receiving his royal commission to bring
300 families to Texas, Austin returned home to
Missouri and died soon after his return. His son,
Stephen, agreed to carry on the impresario grant.
Austin traveled to Natchitoches, where he met with
Spanish commissioners who acknowledged him as
heir to his father's grant (Fehrenbach 1968:136).
Austin was allowed to survey the country and
choose a site for his colony. He searched the area
between Nacogdoches and San Antonio, and eventually claimed the land south of the Camino Real
and between the Colorado and Brazos rivers
(Fehrenbach 1968:137).

Austin's colonists began to arrive in 1821
(Fehrenbach 1968: 138). The settlers in the colony
recognized three types of soil in what came to be
Brazoria County: (1) "cane land," very rich and
easily cleared; (2) "peach land," considered the finest; and (3) "prairie land" (Platter 1962:4-5). The
"peach land" was identified by the wild peach, and
the cane land by dense stands of hardwood trees
(United States Department of Agriculture 1981).
According to Johnson (1961:11):
Brazoria, Fort Bend, Wharton, and
Matagorda counties soon became recognized as the best cane lands. Within
these counties, the growing season was
long enough to allow the cane to mature
sufficiently for the extraction of sugar.
Counties to the north of this region produced cane which would yield juice too
low in saccharin [sucrose] content to
produce sugar ...
In 1828, sugar was growing in Texas and Texans produced between sixty to eighty hogsheads
(barrels containing about one thousand pounds of
crystallized sugar); for 1829, 140 hogsheads were
produced (Creighton 1975:197). Johnson (1961:1113) suggests that:
[a]lthough the sugar industry was fast
expanding in the early 1840s, it was still
in an experimental stage. All mills used
horses for power and most used wooden
rollers for crushing the cane ...
In 1843, Captain William Duncan
erected a steam mill on his Caney Creek
plantation. This was the first steam powered mill in Texas. It came, no doubt, as
a result of Duncan's shift from cultivation of the Creole variety of cane to the
purple ribbon variety, which due to its
very tough fiber, required a steam mill.
In the 1840s, a substantial amount of money
was required to establish a sugar plantation and
mill. To build the mill and acquire the approximately 50 slaves needed (at $500 per slave), required about $50,000 (Johnson 1961:15). This was
a very large sum of money in the pre-Civil-War
years; however, farmers in Texas were better off
than their counterparts in the other Southern states
during this period. Land was available and it was

cheaper (Lowe and Campbell 1987).
In 1852, according to P. A. Champomier
(1852:44), a Louisiana sugar authority, Texas planters produced 11,023 hogsheads of sugar. Production fluctuated according to the weather and rainfall:
in 1853, 8.228 hogsheads were produced; 7,513
hogsheads in 1854; 8,977 in 1855; 150 hogsheads
in 1856; 2,000 in 1857; and 6,000 hogsheads in
1858 (Champomier 1853, 1854, 1855, 1858;
Creighton 1975:205).
After the Civil War, Texas planters began to
revive the sugar industry using convict labor. The
Imperial Sugar Company began with the 1875 partnership of Edward H. Cunningham and Colonel
Littleberry A. Ellis. To operate their sugar lands,
they leased the entire Texas prison population and
sublet those laborers they did not need (Armstrong
1991). In the 1890s, Colonel Cunningham built a
mill and installed the machinery needed to refine
sugar. In 1905, it became Cunningham Sugar Company and in 1917, the Imperial Sugar Company.
In 1878, the state produced 5,664 hogsheads
of sugar, and by 1882, there were 46 planters operating sugar mills. A trend towards consolidation of
sugar mills diminished the number of mills to 14 in
1892 and only 10 in 1909 (Johnson 1961). At the
turn of the 20th century, Texas was producing 0.03
percent of the total United States supply of sugar
(Johnson 1961 :54 ). The decline in sugar production in Texas was mainly due to the loss of prison
labor, as a 1910 law prohibited the leasing of any
convicts (Johnson 1961). Sugar cane is no longer
grown commercially along the upper Texas Gulf
coast, but the Imperial Sugar Company still refines
sugar imported from Hawaii, Louisiana, and Puerto
Rico (Johnson 1961).

FOUR SUGAR PLANTATIONS
IN BRAZORIA COUNTY
This article looks at the architectural features
and floor plans of four sugar plantations that were
constructed in Brazoria County before the Civil
War: Lake Jackson, Osceola, Varner-Hogg and
Bynum (Figure 1).
The Lake Jackson plantation was established
by the Abner Jackson family in the late 1840s and
was a leading producer of sugar in Texas. Jackson
eventually owned three plantations: "Lake Place,"
Darrington, and Retrieve. The history of the Abner

Jackson family and the development of the Lake
Jackson plantation is published in Few et al. (1996),
and is also summarized by Few (this volume) in an
article reporting on the 1994 and 1995 Texas Archeological Society Field Schools. The Lake Jackson State Archeological Site is owned by the Lake
Jackson Historical Association and the site is open
to the public the first Saturday of each month.
Osceola plantation was part of the original
grant of James Brown Austin, the son of Moses
Austin, and the brother of Stephen F. Austin. His
widow was Eliza M. Wes tall Austin, the daughter
of Thomas Westall. Eliza Austin's second husband,
Phillips, died at a young age. As a wealthy, twice
widowed young lady she married her third husband
Colonel William G. Hill in 1836. They established
their first plantation, Waverly, and their second plantation, Osceola, on land she inherited from her first
husband (McCormick 1897:142). Osceola is the
best preserved sugar mill ruins in Brazoria County
because of the protection and preservation efforts
of the present owners. They have preserved a significant monument of Texas history.
The original owner of the Varner-Hogg plantation was C. R. Patton, who began building his
sugar mill in 1847. Patton died in 1856 and his
plantation went through several owners, the last
and most influential owner being Governor James
S. Hogg of Texas, who called the plantation, Varner

535

(Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 1983). The
plantation is now the Varner-Hogg State Park and
is open to the public.
Bynum plantation was one of the two plantations owned by the Mills Brothers: David G. and
Robert. Their two plantations, Low Wood Place
and Bynum Place, were the largest sugar producers
in Texas, according to the sugar production reports
of P. A. Champomier (Champomier 1852-1858).
Bynum is on privately owned land.
Information about Texas planters is found in
census records, probates, financial records,
newspapers, and plantation journals. No records or
blueprints have been found that describe in detail
how Texas planters constructed their sugar mills.
Extensive archeological excavations have been
conducted at the Lake Jackson State Archeological
Site (Lake Jackson Plantation) by faculty and
students from University of Houston Clear Lake
(UHCL), with assistance from the members of the
Texas Archeological Society (TAS), the Brazosport
Archaeological Society (BAS), and the Houston
Archeological Society (HAS). Limited excavations
and a surface survey have been conducted at
Osceola with UHCL students and volunteers from
TAS, BAS, and HAS. At Varner-Hogg and Bynum,
I have done surface mapping. A surface survey at
Varner-Hogg has also been conducted by Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department archeologists (Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department 1983). All the mill
ruins contain structural evidence that documents
how they produced sugar. This research focuses on
the similarities in these four mills in construction,
size, and basic layout.

THE SUGAR MAKING PROCESS
AT OSCEOLA SUGAR MILL
Osceola plantation, in my opinion, is the best
preserved of the 19th century sugar mills in Texas
and will be the basic model for comparison. The
mill has been mapped and photographed, and limited excavations were conducted to expose the kettle
area, fire box, flue chimney, and the front of the
boiler (Figure 2).
The boiler, boiler chimney, engines, and cane
crushers are the components of the first phase of
sugar processing: the extraction of the juice from
the sugar cane. The foundations for these components are substantial structures.

The boiler is 28 feet in length and in excellent
condition (Figure 3). The boiler produced the steam
that powered the sugar cane crushers. The boiler
chimney is approximately 45 feet tall. The height
of the chimney "pulled" the heat through the boiler.

Figure 3. Osceola Boiler and Boiler Chimney.

Two feet of alluvial fill covers the base of the
boiler chimney and the boiler foundation. The
Bynum plantation boiler chimney is also still standing. Both chimneys have a double chimney construction with air spaces between the inner and
outer chimneys; this allows the inner wall to retain heat to assist with the chimney draft.
Figure 4 shows the brick foundations that
supported the cane crushers and the engine that
ran the crushers. The better designed mills in
Louisiana were two stories high (Creighton
1975:199), and the height of the foundations of
the cane crushers at Osceola puts them on the
second floor. The height allowed the extracted
juice to be moved by gravity to the first floor.
Almost identical brick foundations for engines and
crushers were found at the Indian Church mill in
Belize that operated ca. 1860-187 5 (Pendergast
1982). The Indian Church mill still has the cane
crushers and the engine, that powered the crushers,
on their original foundation, making the identification
of these brick structures possible. The ruins at
Osceola, Bynum, and Varner-Hogg indicate that
they had arched supports under the cane crusher
(see Figure 4). Lake Jackson had a solid brick
foundation under the crushers; gears from the
crushers were found at the base of the foundation
during excavations.
The second phase of making sugar is the reduction process and the associated components are the
fire, the kettles, and the flue chimney, called the
train of kettles. Figure 5 shows the basic layout of
a "typical" train of kettles. This drawing does not

give the size of a typical train: the Osceola train is
55 feet in length. The heat was produced by a fire
under the smallest kettle (about 6 feet in diameter).
The heat was then "pulled," by the height of the
flue chimney, through the flue under the kettles,
and it exited up the flue chimney. The lips of the
kettles rested on brick supports that anchored the
kettles over the flue. Plenums in the flue kept the
heat close to the kettles. The area around and between the kettles was plastered to prevent heat
from escaping from the flue. The fire box, flue,
kettle supports, plenums, and flue chimney are all
visible at the Osceola mill.
William Johnson (1961:25) gives this description of the reduction process in the kettles:

537

The first kettle was filled with juice flowing
from the reservoir vats. A mixture of
slaked lime and cane juice, as a clarifying
agent, was poured into the grande. As the
juice began to boil a greenish-gray scum
formed on the surface and became thicker
as the temperature rose. As soon as a
watery vapor forced itself through the
scum, skimming was begun. The scum
was swept into an adjoining vat and carried away. When the skimming was completed the juice was ladled into the next
kettle, where scum not removed in the
first was boiled up. Thus the juice passed
from kettle to kettle until it had passed
through the entire set. Above the kettles a
steam chimney was used to carry away
vapor from the rapidly evaporating cane
juice.
The last kettle, the batterie, received
the concentrated juice which had been
skimmed and tempered with lime. When
the juice reached the proper consistency
for granulation, it was ladled into cooling
troughs, where it formed into crystals.
The metal "grates" of the firebox at Osceola
are of different sizes and form a circular shape
(Figure 6). The fire was on top of the grates and the
ash dropped below them. The smallest kettle was
supported by a brick foundation above the fire. The
flue, above the fire area, conducted the heat of the

Figure 6. Fire Box and Train of Kettles at Osceola Sugar
Mill. The fire sat on top of the metal grates in the
foreground. The flue can be seen between the brick
supports of the "Train." Rubble was left in the flue for
preservation.

fire under the larger kettles. It forked at the end of
the train and provided heat for two La Grande
kettles. Having two kettles made it possible to have
one kettle of juice always warmed and skimmed of
contaminants ready for the reduction process. The
complete process, once started, continued 24 hours
a day until the entire sugar crop was processed
(Creighton 1975:200). If a kettle became too empty
and the sugar carbonized, then the entire operation
had to be stopped, the kettles cooled and cleaned,
and the process started up again. Having a continuous flow of cane juice was critical to the process.
At Osceola and Lake Jackson, the flue takes a
right turn after going under the largest kettle, as it
enters the flue chimney. The arched bricks are a
signature of the opening of the flue chimney (Figure 7), and this opening is in good condition at
Osceola and Lake Jackson.
The final phase of the sugar process was granulation, cooling, and purging, which took place in
the purgery. When the syrup in the smallest and
hottest kettle began to crystallize, the sugar maker
would call "strike!," initiating the removal of the
crystallizing syrup to the cooling trays. Cooling
trays were usually wooden troughs, about 10 feet
long, five feet wide, and 10-12 inches deep. The
sugar maker would sometimes stir the sugar syrup
mass to promote crystallization (Olcott 1857:97).
Cooling trays could remain in the kettle area,
or be removed to the purgery. After a few days, the
coolers were emptied into hogsheads that rested on
supports above a molasses barrel. It required about
30 days for the molasses, uncrystallized syrup, to

drain from the sugar hogshead (Johnson 1961:25).
The architectural features of the purgery are the
large space for purging and storage, the interior
brick walls that supported the hogsheads, and a
wall or space between the mill and the purgery for
fire protection.

A COMPARISON OF SUGAR MILL
FLOOR PLANS
Figure 8 provides interpretive drawings of the
four sugar mills in this study. The mills are arranged with their purgeries on the right to make
comparison easier.
There are three main components of the sugar
making process: extraction, reduction, and purging.
The principal components of the extraction process
are the boiler, the boiler chimney, the engines, and
the crushers. Identification of these components can
be made by the size and shape of their foundations
(Table 1). The boiler is in place at Osceola, and the
boiler chimney is still standing at Osceola and
Bynum. The foundations for the cane crushers and
their engines are identifiable at all four plantations.
The reduction phase of the process was carried
out in the train of kettles that includes the fire box,
the kettles, and the flue chimney. The foundation of
the flue chimney is visible at all four mills and is
located outside of the main walls of the mill. The
flue chimney opening is visible at Osceola and Lake
Jackson. The fire box is visible at Osceola and
Lake Jackson.

State Archeological Landmark (41B0172),
Brazoria County, Texas

ABSTRACT
The Lake Jackson StateArcheologicalLandmark (LJSAL) (4IBO172) in Brazoria County, Texas, contains
three cultural components: a prehistoric hunter-gatherer occupation, a 19th century sugar and cotton plantation,
and a 20th century recreational park. The historic structures have impacted the prehistoric component, mixing
artifacts and destroying prehistoric occupation surfaces. Artifacts, a shell midden, and a small portion of an
undisturbed prehistoric camp comprise the prehistoric component at LJSAL. The different ceramic technologies
in the assemblage suggest the site was utilized by hunter-gatherer groups of the Gulf Coast region that moved
between Galveston Bay and Matagorda Bay. One prehistoric ceramic vessel, an import atypical of the region,
was found in an historic archeological context at the site.

LAKE JACKSON STATE
ARCHEOLOGICALLANDMARK
The Lake Jackson State Archeological Landmark (LJSAL) site (41B0172) is located on the
southeastern edge of Lake Jackson in Brazoria
County, Texas (Figure 1), in an area of intense
prehistoric activity (Figure 2). This 2.719 acre
site, owned by the Lake Jackson Historical Association, is on a thin strip of land between Lake
Jackson and the Dow Chemical Company canal
excavated in the 1940s. The site contains prehistoric and historic remains. Archeological excavations between 1991 and 1998 exposed a Rangia
cuneata shell midden under the sugar mill and a
prehistoric camp site in the main house area. The
historic remains include a 19th century sugar and
cotton plantation and a 20th century park created
by Dow Chemical Company for its employees and
the public (Few, this volume).
Lake Jackson is an abandoned channel of the
Brazos River. The lake is owned by the Lake
Jackson Lake Association, an organization of home
owners around the lake, and is kept at a constant
level by artificial water supply. An aerial
photograph of the lake taken in the 1930s shows
that the lake size fluctuated with rainfall prior to
development in the 1940s. The formation of the

lake can be placed in geological context. The
surface sediments within Brazoria County slope
toward the Gulf of Mexico and were deposited
during the Pleistocene (Beaumont Formation) and
Holocene time periods. "The present course of the
Brazos River subparallels an older, prehistoric
course, now Oyster Creek. The Oyster Creek

were recorded in the Lake Jackson area by the
Gulf Coast Archeological Society and their artifacts and notes are housed at the Brazosport Museum of Natural Science.
The term "Karankawa" can historically be
linked to five primary groups along the upper and
central Texas Coast: Copanes, Coapites, Cujanes,
Carancaguases, and the Coco. The group living near
the mouths of the Colorado and Brazos Rivers were
probably Cocos (Ricklis 1996:5).
The Karankawa material culture is referred to
as the Rockport phase and is identified by stone
tools (arrow points of the Perdiz type, small
unifacial end scrapers, small perforators or drills),
bifacially flaked knives, sandstone metates, or milling slabs, and shell and bone tools. The ceramics
were of a sandy paste clay, sometimes decorated
with paint or coated with asphaltum, a naturally
occurring tar that washes up on Gulf Coast beaches
from petroleum seepages on the Gulf floor (Ricklis
1996:17-29).

course was abandoned by the Brazos River about
1,000 years ago" (USDA 1981:80-81).
The presence of Native Americans in the Texas
Coastal region during historic times is documented
by Aten (1983) Glass (1989), and Ricklis (1996);
Aten (1983), Hamilton (1987), and Ricklis (1996)
discuss the prehistory of the area. Site 41B050 (see
Figure 2), across the lake from the LJSAL site, was
excavated by Lawrence Aten in the 1950s. Excavations at 41B050 revealed, "two thin Rangia cuneata
shell lenses separated by about 5 cm of sterile silty
clay" (Aten 1983: 199). "Both zones contained ceramics, arrow points, seasonality samples, and a large
quantity of faunal remains" (Aten 1983:200). Two
radiocarbon dates taken for the lower zone indicate a
possible occupation of A.D. 300, and Aten
(1983:200) concluded that "the upper zone is undoubtedly habitation refuse from the main grog tempered ceramic period, equivalent to the Round Lake
Period of the Galveston Bay Area."
In 1957, the Gulf Coast Archeological Society excavated a prehistoric burial ground approximately 300 yards east of the LJSAL boundary (see
Figure 2). These burials were found during the
construction of a road. Numerous prehistoric sites

Historic Impact on Evidence of
Prehistoric Occupation

Construction of the "Lake Place" Plantation by
Abner Jackson in the late 1840s impacted the remains of prehistoric occupations at the site. Archeological excavations between 1991 and 1998
have uncovered prehistoric artifacts and exposed
disturbed and undisturbed prehistoric deposits. As
trenches were excavated to lay the historic foundations, prehistoric artifacts were disturbed and mixed
with historic artifacts. The construction of the main
house and associated structures disturbed the remains of a prehistoric camp. Archeological excavations at the Sugar Mill have exposed two areas of a
prehistoric Rangia cuneata shell midden.
Construction of the Dow Chemical Company
Park in the 1940s disturbed plantation and prehistoric deposits. Bulldozers were used to level plantation ruins, excavate drainage ditches, and build a
road. These activities brought prehistoric artifacts
to the surface and spread them around the site. The
prehistoric surface under Structure D was only 3-5
cm below the base of the road bed. In 1993, a
backhoe was used to remove the Dow-built road
that ran the full length of the site. The removal was
done under the direction and supervision of the
senior author, but the area just below and to the
side of the road was disturbed. Because of these

Few, Fustes, and McClure -

The Prehistoric Component at Lake Jackson Landmark 543

disturbances, the artifacts located in disturbed areas
can be analyzed only in terms of a site assemblage,
not by location. Two areas of prehistoric deposits
appear to have minimal disturbance and will be
discussed in this article.
Structures A, B, D, and the Sugar Mill (Figure
3) have undergone the most extensive archeological investigation and, therefore, have yielded the
most prehistoric artifacts. Excavations at Structures
C, I, and the main house were limited to exposing
the structures. Structures J and H were not excavated because they were virtually destroyed during
the construction of the Dow Chemical Company
Canal in the 1940s. Structures E, F, and G have not
been excavated due to lack of time and man power.
An undisturbed prehistoric surface was found
under Structure D in units S3/W99 and S6/W99
inside room B. This deposit is 3-5 cm below the
base of the Dow Chemical Company road. In unit
S3/W99 (Level 3), 57 prehistoric artifacts were
found: 31 pieces of lithic debris, six bone fragments (to small to identify), two points, and 18
pottery sherds. In S6/W99 (Level 3), 83 prehistoric artifacts were found, including 67 bone fragments to small to identify, eight lithic debris, and
8 pottery sherds. Of the sherds found, 10 were
large enough to be analyzed: they had a sandy
paste with sand or shell temper. Six exhibited a
film on the interior and two of these had an exterior film as well. One sandy paste sherd with sand
temper had an asphaltum film on the exterior and
interior surfaces.
When the sugar mill was being built, builders'
trenches for the foundation of the mill impacted a
Rangia cuneata shell midden. A thin lens of Rangia

(10 to 15 mm) was found in Block N18/E918 (Figure 4) in Level 3, at 3.20 feet below datum. In this
lens, no other artifacts were found other than Rangia
shell. Shells were counted in the field and totaled
1,954 halves. Two 9 x 16-inch soil sample bags
were used to collect a sample of the midden for 100
percent recovery utilizing water screening through
fine mesh in the laboratory. No artifacts were found
other than shell, however. Of note was the uniformity of the shells in Block Nl8/E918: 90 percent
measured 1.8 cm across the widest point, 10 percent measured 2 cm across, and only five shells
measured 3.1 cm across. This uniformity may indicate selective gathering of Rangia.
Another portion of this midden was uncovered
in Block N54/E927 in Level 3 (Figure 5). The
midden was two to four shells (l .5-3 cm thick) in
depth. The Rangia shells had the same uniformity
and size range as those found in Block Nl8/E918.
The midden was divided into three equal portions
and removed in soil sample bags for water screening. The fine screening produced three pottery
sherds and bone fragments. There were 100+ unidentified vertebrate bone fragments. Identified bone

mammal; gar scales, teeth and vertebrae; teleost
fish vertebrae, spines and ribs; catfish spines; frog
scapula, radio-ulna and vertebra; leopard frog (a
subadult of Rana sphenocephala ) maxilla; an unidentified mammal deciduous tooth fragment; a rodent tibia; and a hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon
hispidus) molar. This is a very small sample; however, the evidence of deer-size mammal, Rangia,
and fish as the main food sources may indicate a
late summer to early fall occupation (Hamilton
1987:124).

ARTIFACTS
Five hundred and six prehistoric artifacts were
found in the LJSAL excavations. The assemblage
includes five arrowpoints, 39 pieces of lithic debris, four chert tools, bone fragments (n=304), ceramic sherds (n=153), and one oyster shell with a
possible drilled hole. The bone fragments included
in the prehistoric assemblage are those found in the
undisturbed prehistoric deposits under Structure D
and the Sugar Mill.

Lithks
Four complete projectile points (Figure 6), and
one broken arrow point were found: three Perdiz,
one triangular in form, and one unidentified point
(#9.059) (Table 1). Four lithic tools were also
recovered (Figure 7): a graver, two scrapers, and a
chopper. The graver appears to be made from a
broken point, and the unifacial scrapers and the
chopper are from flakes. Thirty nine unutilized
flakes were also found in the prehistoric deposits.

Hamilton (1987:104). The presence of asphaltum
on a sandy paste vessel may also indicate Rockport
Black-on-Grey wares (Ricklis 1996:29). This is a
very small assemblage, but the presence of different ceramic technologies may suggest the area was
used by various groups who hunted and gathered in
the Galveston Bay to Matagorda Bay areas.

prehistoric vessels and because of its historic
archeological context is not included in the
prehistoric assemblage at this site. It resembles in
shape a Karnack Brushed-Incised jar illustrated in
Suhm and Jelks (l 962:Plate 43F). This vessel has a
silty paste with no discernible temper. Its
measurements are: base thickness, 6.12 mm; rim
thickness at base of rim, 5.33 mm; rim thickness at
top edge of rim, 4 mm; exterior mouth, 90 mm;
diameter at largest point, 110.9 mm; and height
111.25 mm. The exterior of the vessel has markings
that may be from smoothing or brushing. There is
evidence on the exterior of a black slip or film.

CONCLUSIONS
Prehistoric artifacts, a shell midden, and a small
portion of an undisturbed prehistoric camp comprise the prehistoric occupation at LJSAL. The artifact assemblage, from disturbed and undisturbed
deposits, may represent different time periods that
the site was used as well as use by different huntergatherer groups. An almost complete vessel was
also recovered in 19th century archeological contexts in the sugar mill that is not typical of local
ceramic wares.
The Lake Jackson State Archeological Landmark site is in a geographic area where many prehistoric sites have been located and excavated. One
point (see Figure 6, Specimen 9.059) does not resemble a common arrow point type and may date to
the historic period. The artifact assemblage documents the utilization of the area by coastal hunter-

Knapping Implements in Mortuary Context: A Case
from Morhiss (41VT1) with Comparative Data
from Texas and the Midcontinent
John E. Dockal! and Helen Danzeiser Dockall

ABSTRACT
Burial 119 from theMorhiss site (41VT1) was interred with an assemblage consisting of a variety of antler,
bone, and lithic artifacts. All grave associations were coated with red ocher prior to interment. The technological
aspects of the artifacts suggest their use in both the manufacture and maintenance of flaked stone tools and may
tempt some to refer to the assemblage as a "toolkit" or "flintknapper' skit." An examination of the composition
of similar mortuary assemblages from Texas sites suggests that reference to "kits" and "toolkits" indicate that
there is considerable variability in what may be considered representative of these "kits." In these cases, we are
not presented with a complete picture of the composition of stone tool manufacture and maintenance tool sets.

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this paper is twofold. First,
we want to provide a detailed description of Burial
119 from the Morhiss site (41 VTl) that includes
osteology, pathology, and associated artifacts. Second, we wish to promote discussion and further
critical thinking in interpreting such patterned
archeological remains. The significance of this
burial is related to the array of grave goods, the
symbolic treatment of those artifacts upon interment with the individual, and the comparison to
similar examples from Texas and the midcontinental United States.
The identification of stone tool/weapons
system manufacture and maintenance implements
in an archeological context usually leaves little
doubt as to their function and the general modes
and situations of use. But when these same
implements are recovered in mortuary context, we
can no longer assume that we understand the
reasons why the implements were interred with
the deceased. Variously, such archeological
materials have been interpreted as being personal
belongings of the deceased who may have been a
specialist at some level in the manufacture of stone
tools. Seeman (1985:Appendix 1.1) provides a
detailed list of interpretations for mortuary

associations of knapping implements from sites in
the Midcontinent.
In most instances it can be said that individuals
were interred with an array of artifacts that included
implements employed to maintain and manufacture
stone tools. Little is often said as to whether these
assemblages are complete tool sets or represent
instances of craft specialization. Differences between
inferred knapping or arrow/dart-making toolkits from
the Midcontinent and possible examples from Texas
suggest that there are some potentially significant
differences that can be identified that may relate to
individual status, sex, and in some cases, craft
specialization. But is there more that can be obtained
from further study of these mortuary associations
and their composition? Torrence (1989:2) informed
us that it depends on the nature of the questions that
we are asking when she stated:
How do tools contribute to social reproduction in societies with varying degrees of complexity and how do they
relate to other forms of behavior such
as exchange, ritual, or symbolic systems? How can we explain variability
in the way people manufacture and use
tools as well as differences in the tools
themselves?

SITE DESCRIPTION
Morhiss is an Archaic mortuary site located on
the Western Gulf Coastal Plain in Victoria County,
Texas (Figure 1). The site is located on a remnant
river terrace on the east bank of the Guadalupe
River, approximately 3.8 km south of the modem
city of Victoria (Campbell 1976:81). Morhiss was
excavated from October 1938 to January 1940 by
workers for the Warks Project Administration
(WP A) under the direction of project archeologist
William A. Duffen. The site measures 145 m long
and 91 m wide (Campbell 1976:81). The site was
also about 32.3 km from the nearest portion of San
Antonio Bay and 64.4 km from the coastal strand.

WPA excavations recorded 219 poorly
preserved human burials, with the majority being
recovered on the southeastern slope of the site
(Jackson 1939:70). Due to poor preservation, only
181 discrete individuals were curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas (Dockall 1997:43). In addition, over
30 hearths were identified during excavations
(Campbell 1976:83). Also recovered was one of the
largest shell artifact assemblages (over 3000
specimens) from any site on the Western Gulf
Coastal Plain, consisting of ornaments and tools
(Dockall and Dockall 1996). The bone and shell
artifact collections included some manufacturing
debris, indicating that some items were made at the
site. Shell artifacts included beads, adzes, edgemodified Sunray Venus, and hammers.

PRESENCE OF UTILITARIAN
OBJECTS IN TEXAS ARCHAIC
CEMETERIES

Figure 1. Location of the Morhiss site (41 VT1) in Victoria
County, Texas within the West Gulf Coastal Plain.

Morhiss had remained undated by chronometric means until recently, but projectile point styles
indicated a strong Archaic period occupation
(Dockall 1997:45). The lithic assemblage consisted
primarily of Morhiss, Lerma, Refugio, Pandora,
Nolan, and Darl Archaic dart points (Campbell
1976:83). There are traces of Late Paleoindian and
Late Prehistoric components as well. In 1995, the
Texas Archeological Society Donor's Fund enabled
the junior author to obtain one AMS radiocarbon
date on skeletal material from Burial 159 from
Morhiss. The resulting uncorrected and uncalibrated
date is 2410 Â± 50 B.P., or 460 B.C., a firm Late
Archaic date (Dockall 1997:46). This date is significant because it demonstrates that at least some
of the Morhiss burials are contemporaneous with
those of the Group 2 burials at Ernest Witte (see
Hall 1981).

Recently, Taylor (1995:663-699) has performed a tremendous service to Texas archeology
by synthesizing and interpreting the massive amount
of published and unpublished information on mortuary items in Archaic cemeteries in Texas. For the
present brief study, knapping implements are
grouped as a class of utilitarian artifacts.
A number of burials at Morhiss (41 VTl) included clusters of utilitarian items as grave associations (Duffen n.d.; Taylor 1995:689). Burial 139
(adult male) included three clam shells, a bone flaker
or awl, four flint flakers, and shell bead blanks.
Burial 39 (adult male) had a bone awl, an antler
flaker, an antler ornament, a shell necklace, and
two stones with pigment. Burial 50 (young adult
male) at Morhiss included worked shell, drilled
shell, 50 columella beads, and an antler flaker. A
series of probable "tool kits" were recorded with
some of the other burials at Morhiss. Burial 61
(adult indeterminate) grave associations included
five gouges.
Taylor (1995:689) identified an interesting and
possibly significant difference in utilitarian grave
associations between the earlier mineralized human
skeletal remains (largely represented by fully flexed
and bundle burials) at Morhiss and the later nonmineralized skeletal remains (dominated by flexed
and extended interments). The earlier mineralized

Dockal! and Dockall interments were characterized by a predominance
of various types of lithic implements, including
dart point fragments, stemmed drills, keeled scrapers, gouges (presumably Guadalupe bifaces), a
chopper, and manos. The later burial group included
dart points, a blade, and flakes. Additionally, this
later group also included a number of bone needles,
awls, flakers, and billets (see Taylor 1995:689).
Both groups had burials with "knives," "scrapers,"
and asphaltum.
Of the major mortuary sites along the West
Gulf Coastal Plain and adjacent regions summarized by Taylor (1995:689-691), namely: Olmos
Dam (41BX1), Blue Bayou (41VT94), Ernest Witte
(41AU36), Rudy Haiduk (41KA23), Rodd Field
(41NU29), and others, the presence of various utilitarian implements was not as prevalent as encountered at Loma Sandia (41LK28). In particular, Loma
Sandia is noted for the abundance of stacks of lithic
implements associated with some burials, especially
Tortugas points, Lange points, and distally beveled
implements. Rudy Haiduk, Morhiss, and the Rio
Salado Burial, all located within or directly adjacent to South Texas, had burials with associated
stacks of utilitarian lithic and bone/antler/shell
implements. Taylor (1995:691) considered this as a
distinctive trait of southern Texas mortuary sites.
From the available data, these clusters of utilitarian
goods seem to be primarily associated with adults,
more commonly adult males.

on the narrow width of the sciatic notch as well as
the preauricular sulcus, which appears as a groove
of ligament attachment rather than as a groove of
pregnancy (see Houghton 1974). Age estimations
were based only on the condition of the auricular
surface following Lovejoy et al. (1985). Using this
technique, age was estimated for Burial 119 at 3544 years old. This is based on characteristics of the
auricular surface, including coarse granulation and
reduced billowing. Slight changes were observed
in the apex of the auricular surface and some
microporosity was evident.
Medical disorders were limited to bone fusions. The proximal and distal phalanges of the
right fifth digital ray of the hand were fused together, as were the proximal and distal phalanges
of the first ray of the right foot. The proximal and
medial phalanges of the hand fifth ray were fused
together at a right angle (Figure 2), with a subsequent disuse atrophy of the shaft of the medial
phalanx. Was ting from lack of use may be seen as
recently as a few weeks after disuse (Steinbock
1976:261). The nature of the fusion suggests a traumatic origin. Ortner and Putschar (1985:69) noted
that the fracture of adjacent joints can result in
fusion occurring with comminuted fractures and
callus formation over the joint. The origin of the
injury cannot with certainty be associated with
knapping activities.

OSTEOLOGY AND PATHOLOGIES
OF BURIAL 119
Field descriptions of Burial 119 indicated a
male buried in a fully extended position in an eastwest orientation, head to the west and facing south.
Unfortunately, little of this individual could be recovered due to the extremely fragmented and poorly
preserved nature of the remains. No skull or teeth
were curated, nor were any thoracic or arm elements. Skeletally, this burial is represented solely
by the portion of the right ilium bearing the sciatic
notch and auricular surface, a portion of the left
femoral diaphysis, portions of both tibiae, and the
distal ends of both fibulae. In addition, the proximal and medial phalanges of the right fifth digital
ray of the hand were recovered, as were the proximal and distal phalanges of the right first toe.
The sex determination as male was based solely

right first toe; Right: Fusion of proximal and medial
phalanges of the right fifth finger.

The proximal and distal phalanges of the right
first toe are fused together, but not misaligned (see
Figure 2). Therefore, it is harder to attribute to
trauma. It is possible that it represents a congenital
union of two phalanges. This usually results when a
joint fails to differentiate and, when seen, is typically identified in distal phalangeal joints of the
toes (Resnick and Niwayama 1988:3560). In this
instance, a case of congenital symphalangism is
inferred based on the presence of a "smooth osseous contour" (Resnick and Niwayama 1988:3560)
between the joints.

mentioned as having been embedded in the mass
of asphaltum but could not be located for analysis.
The final grave inclusion was a "mass of Mexican
persimmons" (Jackson 1939:5). Presumably seeds
made up the mass, but this was not made clear in
the description. It is also not clear as to whether
the seeds or fruits were charred. Burial 119 was
the only individual excavated in which grave
associations were covered in red ocher, possibly
denoting the distinctive status of this individual.
Antler Billets

DESCRIPTION OF THE BURIAL 119
BURIAL ASSOCIATIONS
Schiffer (1987:41) noted that an individual's
personal items technically become obsolete upon
death. Those items that are not interred with the
individual or destroyed in funerary rituals are available to be reused or laterally recycled, generally
through inheritance.
The personal artifact inventory of mobile
hunter-gatherers is limited by the frequency of
moves. Thus, survivors may not necessarily be in
a position to take on personal items of the deceased. Therefore, the death of an individual in
these groups may result in little reuse or recycling
as personal items are destroyed or interred. This
concept may explain the inclusion of the items
with Burial 119. This is assuming that all grave
goods associated with Burial 119 were that
individual's personal property. It is just as plausible to assume that none or only a portion of the
items were personal property, which would lead
to entirely different interpretations. To approach
this topic would require a detailed mortuary analysis of the Morhiss site, well beyond the scope of
this paper.
Elements of the assemblage include antler
artifacts, lithic debris, a flaked uniface, a sandstone
abrader, long bone artifacts, and asphaltum. The
Texas Memorial Museum accession number for
the lot of items from Burial 119 is TMM 7-1-830.
All artifacts, including the asphaltum, were
covered in red ocher. Field notes indicate that the
lump of asphaltum was placed near the right hip.
There is no other information in Duffen's (n.d.)
notes relating to the relative position of these
artifacts. A knife and bone needle are also

The assemblage of antler billets (n=5) was
composed of one complete and four fragmentary
specimens (Table 1 and Figure 3). All billets were
entirely coated in red ocher making examination of
use-wear at the distal ends difficult. The complete
billet is well-smoothed at the base, perhaps from
prehension during use. The distal end is extremely
worn and smooth, exhibiting a slight use-bevel.
Fragments all retain intact distal ends with welldeveloped bevels and smooth surfaces.

Burial 119.

Antler Tine Pressure Flaker
Ocher staining is present on the proximo-medial portion of the one tine (Figure 4 bottom). A
slight amount of rodent gnawing is present at the
tip. The base of the tine has a remnant of an incised groove that indicates it was cut by the
groove and snap technique. The fracture surface
at the base has been abraded to remove sharp

Antler Punch Fragment
In addition to antler billets and pressure flakers,
the kit included a single distal fragment of an antler
punch for indirect percussion (Figure 4 top). This
specimen is also entirely stained in ocher except for
the broken end. The working end is quite rough,
irregular, and blunted from heavy use such as would
occur during indirect percussion.

Figure 4. Top: Fragmentary antler tine punch; note blunted
end; Bottom: Reconstructed antler flaker. Both were
included as grave goods with Burial 119.

Uniface
The flaked uniface was manufactured by soft
hammer invasive flaking on the dorsal surface of
a secondary cortex macro-flake (Figure 5). Both
dorsal and ventral surfaces were covered in red
ocher. The cortex is stream battered and the material is identical to other chert types observed in
the Morhiss collections. Flake dimensions are:
Length= 9.2 cm; Width= 5.1 cm; Thickness = 1.6 cm.
Another small proximal flake fragment was
also recovered from the burial but has no red ocher
or use wear. It may have been incidentally incorporated into the grave fill.

Sandstone Abrader
A single sandstone abrader was included in
the kit (Figure 6). The raw material is a coarsegrained gray-brown sandstone. It is roughly oval in
shape with a longitudinal groove on one surface
from use, possibly as a biface edge abrader or to
maintain the shape of billets and punches. Both
surfaces are coated in red ocher. Dimensions:
Length= 12.8 cm; Width= 10.1 cm; Thickness average = 2.1 cm.

Incised Long Bone Implement Fragment

Figure 6. Sandstone abrader recovered with Burial 119.

This fragment represents a probable long bone
cortical fragment or split metapodial implement.
The condition is very fragmentary but it is ocherstained on the exterior incised surface. Cancellous
interior material is not present. The outer cortical
surface displays a deeply incised design characterized by discrete zones of encircling chevrons or
zig-zag lines (Figure 7). Each zone is created by
three incised lines. The design on this fragment
compares favorably to similar designs observed on
other split metapodial implements from Morhiss
and other Archaic mortuary sites in the region (Hall
1981, 1988). Dimensions: Length= 8.3 cm;
Width= 1.7 cm; Thickness= 0.5 cm.
Unincised Split Long Bone
Implement Fragments

associated with Burial 119. Note the incised chevron or

All three specimens are fragments, representing the proximal ends of this implement type (Figure 8). These fragments represent either unincised
bone implements or unmodified fragments of decorated bone implements (see Hall 1981). Red ocher
covers both surfaces of each fragment except for
the fracture surface at the ends. The proximal end
of each artifact is well-smoothed by abrasion and
forms a distinct beveled surface. The interior has
also been abraded smooth and the cancellous material removed by scraping. There is no decoration.
The blanks for these and similar implements seem
to have been split metapodials of medium-sized
artiodactyls, perhaps deer.

A large mass of asphaltum (contained in two
small boxes numbered 2671; the artifacts discussed

Dockal! and Dockall - Knapping Implements in Mortuary Context 553
above were also in these numbered boxes) was
included with Burial 119. It is estimated that between 800-1000 grams are present along with traces
of red ocher. Unfortunately, the mass of asphaltum
was recovered in a large number of small angular
fragments. A knife (2673) and bone needle (2672)
discussed earlier were embedded on the surface of
the mass and it seemed that the asphaltum had been
contained in a "skin pouch" (Duffen n.d.).

COMMENTS ON OCHER STAINING
The presence of ocher on the surfaces of the
antler billets and other grave inclusions with Burial
119 is potentially significant because it may indicate the symbolic treatment of utilitarian mortuary
items. During analysis of the artifacts it was concluded that the ocher had been applied after being
combined with some type of liquid. Traces of ocher
can be observed deep into surface concavities of
the antler and bone artifacts and the sandstone
abrader. It is possible that it was rubbed into the
surface in powder form.

COMPARISONS WITH OTHER
KNAPPING IMPLEMENT SETS
FROM TEXAS AND THE
MIDCONTINENT
Sometimes, researchers have attributed variability in technology to differences in subsistence
(Binford 1980; Bettinger 1991), primarily assigning hunter-gatherer groups to either forager or collector. There is also some indication that social
complexity may be in part related to patterns of
subsistence and settlement (Binford 1980: 17). But,
as Thomas (1983) has demonstrated for Great Basin hunter-gatherer groups, the collector-forager dichotomy need not be associated with dramatic
differences in social organization, complexity, or
technological organization.
Irrespective of the causes of technological, social, and complexity differences, one cannot deny
those observed between Texas and the
Midcontinent. Previous research has shown that the
Midcontinental region was the locus of a complex
series of social, cultural, and technological changes
(Charles 1995;Hall 1981:285-288;JeffriesandButler 1982: 19-24; Goldstein 1980; Griffin 1983). Data

and research for much of Texas indicates that, to
varying degrees, prehistoric groups were characterized by an egalitarian hunter-gatherer lifeway. Exceptions would include areas where Native groups
were practicing agriculture or had formativechiefdom level social structures.
Bousman (1993:76-78) has emphasized the
idea that manufacture/maintenance tools were not
used and repaired in the same manner as weapons
and other tools. His discussion is couched in terms
of a forager/collector dichotomy. It is also probable
that social complexity and technological organization differences can influence patterns of use and
maintenance of manufacturing implements and kit
composition. Mortuary and cache contexts provide
one means of examining toolkit differences and
how these implements were used and discarded.
Comparative data from the Midcontinent and Texas
are used here to briefly examine potential differences that may be related to social complexity and
technological organization broadly characteristic of
these areas.
Comparisons can be made between Burial 119
from Morhiss and similar mortuary assemblages
from Texas (Appendix 1). Other comparative data
for the Midcontinent are obtained from Seeman
(1985:Appendix 1.1). The examples from Texas
are not meant to be exhaustive but probably represent the general range of variability observed among
such mortuary assemblages interpreted as knapping
toolkits or personal kits containing some knapping
implements. There is probably considerable variability in what different analysts would consider to
represent such kits and what artifacts should be
present, hence the variability among examples in
Appendix 1. One way of examining differences is
to consider the presence/absence of particular artifact types probably associated with knapping (Table
2), and the proportion of each artifact type among
both combined samples. The analysis does not include any other artifacts present within the burial
because of the focus on knapping implements.
The sample sizes from Texas and the
Midcontinent are too small to attempt analysis by
time period or various statistical methods. It is also
assumed for the sake of this preliminary analysis
that both samples are broadly comparable. Based
on this analysis, there are some differences that can
be observed between the two areas.
Regarding Texas, various flaking tools of bone
and antler are the most common implement

Counts represent the number of individual burials/caches with each artifact type

represented. Interestingly, they are more common
than billets of bone or antler, but billets are as
common as abraders or whetstones. Midcontinent
toolkits are equal in proportions of billets and
flaking implements, followed in abundance by
abraders and whetstones. It may be significant that
punches are better represented in Texas toolkits
than Midcontinent examples, but this may also be
related to the difficulty in identification of punches,
and possible confusion with blunted antler and bone
flaking implements. Shaft straighteners and shaft
wrenches (potentially functionally similar artifact
types) are much more common in Midcontinent
toolkits, with the only Texas example being the
Late Paleoindian double burial from Hom Shelter
No. 2 (Redder 1985). The equivalent presence of
ocher as either lumps, stained rocks, or on the
surfaces of artifacts probably indicates the general
use of this material in a mortuary context and it is
not considered to be associated with the presence
or absence of knapping implements.
The observed differences in composition
between the combined samples may be ultimately
related to a greater degree of specialization and
status associated with the manufacture and repair
of stone tools and weapons in Midcontinental
Woodland and Mississippian societies than among
Texas hunter-gatherers and agricultural groups.
Although there are similarities in the types of
knapping tools included as grave goods between

Texas and Woodland/Mississippian groups, there
is a trend for the latter to be more specialized in
terms of the abundance of certain artifact types,
most notably shaft wrenches/straighteners and
abraders/whetstones. A greater representation of
shaft wrenches and abraders/whetstones in
association with other types of knapping tools could
arguably indicate a greater co-occurrence of these
artifact types among Midcontinent burials and
toolkits. If we consider this association to represent
a true trend in burial practices and knapping
technology in this region, then the association of
other implements not directly related to knapping
but instead with the manufacture and repair of
perishable portions of weapons sets further supports
this hypothesis (see below).
Additional artifacts were also included with
knapping implements in burials from both Texas
(Table 3) and the Midcontinent. Again, although
we are limited by sample size and the obvious problems with differences in artifact identification, there
are some trends that are provocative regarding potential regional differences. These limitations have
made it necessary to use broad artifact categories
based on function, irrespective of raw material differences. The objective was to identify potential
trends in functional types between the two sample
groups. Commonalities exist in the presence of various types of ornaments and chert drills. Small flake
tools such as burins, spokeshaves, and gravers are

Counts represent the number of individual burials/caches with each artifact type

more common among Midcontinent burials with
knapping tools. If these types of small flake tools
can be linked to woodworking or other similar tasks,
then hafted, unhafted, and in situ incisors and small
mandibles may also be included as similar implements. A greater abundance of these implements
among Midcontinent burials may indicate that
knapping toolkits were more extensive and oriented
toward the manufacture of a wider array of artifacts
of stone and perishable materials. Seeman (1985: 18)
suggested that such artifacts could have included
bow staves, atlatls, and arrow/dart shafts and
foreshafts. There is a trend for those burials described by Seeman (1985) to have a wider array of
artifacts coupled with a greater numbers of these
same artifacts, and he uses this evidence to foster
arguments for specialized toolkits, craft specialization, and the status of the deceased individual.

The Texas data (see Appendix 1) do not exhibit
the variability and numbers observed in Seeman's
sample. All things being equal, this could argue for
a less specialized repertoire of tools employed by
hunter-gatherer groups in Texas, or conversely it
could be indicative of differences in discard rituals
between these regions. Texas burials that exhibit
the greatest similarity to those from the
Midcontinent in terms of artifact variability and
numbers include the Rudy Haiduk site (Mitchell et
al. 1984) in Karnes County, Alex Justiss (Bell 1981)
in Titus County, and Tyson (Tom Middlebrook,
1997 personal communication) in Shelby County,
but overall the Texas sample does not have the
uniformity of composition exhibited by burials
included in Seeman's (1985:Appendix 1.1) data.
This hints at a greater degree of craft specialization
or status associated with knapping and related

Nelson 1991; Torrence 1983, 1989). Although issues are always much more complex than they appear initially, Bleed's (1986:739) discussion of
maintainable and reliable technologies does provide some indication of what may be expected in
such technologies. One of his key characteristics of
reliable weapons systems includes a generalized
repair kit with sufficient raw materials and tools to
effect any repair. Manufacture and maintenance are
frequently the responsibility of specialists. While
maintainable weapons systems are manufactured
and maintained by the user, repair and use co-occur, and the emphasis is on the overall ease of
repair with a less complex repair kit.
Subsistence and mobility strategies also can
influence the time and energy available for tool
manufacture or repair, and as a result influence the
composition of tool manufacture and repair kits
(Bettinger 1991:69; Bousman 1993:73; Binford
1979, 1980; Torrence 1983, 1989). Ultimately, the
composition and orientation of tools and toolkits
are governed by a series of constraints (Hayden et
al. 1996:11-14) that include the task(s) to be performed; raw materials available; available technology (also skill); and socio-economic concerns
(mobility, transport, labor, and storage). All of
these factors influence the design of the tool or
weapon, along with use, maintenance, and repair
strategies.
Another potential variable that may be important is that as the time and effort invested in tool
manufacture and maintenance increases so too does
the use-life of that tool (see Shott 1989). This would
be indicated by the number and variety of different
tool types associated with stone tool manufacture/
repair and weapons design and manufacture.

act1v1tles among Woodland, Mississippian, and
Protohistoric groups than most Archaic and Late
Prehistoric groups in Texas.
Unlike associated knapping implements from
Texas, Midcontinent associations appear to represent sets of specialized implements for the manufacture/maintenance of a range of artifacts
associated with hunting technology. Midcontinent
toolkits may have been designed for more replacement of parts in weapons systems while those from
Texas, in general, seem to have been designed for a
greater degree of parts repair rather than components replacement.
The overwhelming majority of Texas and
Midcontinent knapping toolkits examples are associated with adult males (Table 4). This suggests
that knapping implements are more frequently associated with adult males than with adult females.
Reasons for inclusion of knapping implements in
the graves of deceased females may be the result of
other unidentified social factors operating beyond
the male/female division of labor and are not addressed here. The general trend seems to be for
inclusion of knapping implements in mortuary context to be age and sex specific.

INFERENCES REGARDING
TECHNOLOGICAL
ORGANIZATION BASED ON
MORTUARY ASSOCIATIONS
We are all to varying degrees familiar with the
growing debate involving reliable and maintainable
toolkits and similarly oriented technologies (see

It is proposed here that the overall toolkit and
mortuary data from Texas fit very well within the
parameters of forager group toolkits associated
with low production costs where manufacture and
repair co-occur. The suggested toolkit and
technology are broadly generalized, and emphasize
ease of repair and replacement as a part of their
design (see Hayden et al. 1996). A major part of
the generalized toolkit would probably be a variety
of expedient short use-life implements that would
not be curated or interred in mortuary contexts.
This may account for the overall similarity of types
of manufacture/maintenance implements from
mortuary and cache contexts in Texas. Data from
the Midcontinent (Seeman 1985) are strongly
suggestive of a different set of strategies and social
factors influencing the design and composition of
maintenance toolkits and technology (as judged
from mortuary context). This is reflected in greater
numbers and varieties of manufacture/maintenance
tools associated with burials from the Midcontinent.
If these toolkits do represent more specialized tool
associations, then it may be hypothesized that the
components of the toolkits were also more
functionally specific as compared to the more
generalized Texas examples. In this light, the tool

association of Burial 119 at Morhiss may represent
only a portion of the maintenance/manufacture
technology and not a specialized knapping kit.
When making inferences regarding the function
or role of technological items in mortuary or cache
context, it is necessary to consider the items that
may be absent, the overall technological system of
which they were a part, and the probable social
framework.

A Summary of Processes Affecting Archeological Sites
in Artificial Reservoirs
Andrew F. Malof

ABSTRACT
Site inundation dynamics are examined through a comparison of the processes affecting submerged and
intermittently submerged sites in artificial reservoirs. To enhance the limited data base, an experimental design
involving the quantification of features and artifact displacement is proposed.

INTRODUCTION
Cultural resource management is increasingly
involved with the evaluation of sites tied to either
future or existing reservoirs. As the number of reservoirs increase, so do the number of sites impacted
by their construction or existence. Reservoirs
present a complex set of circumstances effecting
archeological resources. All levels are impacted:
the macro- or regional scale, the meso- or site scale,
and the micro- or artifact scale.
The premier study to date is the National Reservoir Inundation Study (NRIS) conducted by National Park Service personnel in the late 1970s.
This report is primarily a summary of their findings, as well as an attempt to make the results
regionally significant.

THE NRIS STUDY
Beginning in 1976, the National Park Service
instituted the NRIS (Lenihan et al. 1981). The
project was geared towards better understanding
how to best manage inundated archeological
resources (Lenihan et al. 198l:v). Two problems
were addressed: first, the prediction of effects from
impending inundation on existing archeological
resources, and, second, the mitigation of those
situations (Lenihan et al. 1981: 17). Four categories
of impact were recognized. The first was

mechanical, which includes the "physical erosion
and depositional processes associated with any large
body of water." The biochemical factors require
examining the new ecosystem formed after initial
filling. Human factors include increased artificial
impacts on archeological resources, both directly,
through greater access, and indirectly, through an
increase in wave action caused by boat traffic.
Various miscellaneous factors are also included,
such as changes in the floral and faunal components
of a location, and the resource may be lost to
research through inundation or submergence below
silt deposits (Lenihan et al. 1981:18-19).
These factors combine to produce a wide array
of situations that must be considered when examining a reservoir, whether potential or existing. The
NRIS considered impacts at three different levels
of archeological resources, loosely categorized in
the macro-, meso- and micro-scales. In short, four
types of processes are operating on three levels of
resources. The biochemical processes are most important during initial filling, as an equilibrium is
soon established, barring major changes in other
variables. The biological community is obviously
vastly altered, as terrestrial communities are supplanted by aquatic ones. Chemical processes are
evident as water reacts with substrates; however,
these too become stabilized in time. The miscellaneous and human-induced factors are difficult to
control. Of primary importance to the majority of
extant reservoirs are the mechanical processes.

These consist primarily of wave action and current,
erosion, and sedimentation.

of a basin hearth will be more stable than a simple
surface-laid ring hearth (Malof 1996:72).

MECHANICAL PROCESSES

Artifact Impacts

These processes include the effects of waves
and their by-products, currents. Also of importance
is slope failure or slumping, saturation of lake bed
deposits, and siltation (Lenihan et al. 1981: 18). The
most drastic of these impacts is wave action and
current at the lake/shore interface

Regional Impacts
The long-term effect of a man-made reservoir
is that it will eventually fill completely with sediment, and thus become a vast floodplain (Lenihan
et al. 1981 :82). Archeological sites once accessible
will be buried under tons of overburden, effectively
sealing them from any additional research. They
will be lost as surely as if they had been destroyed.
In a system of lakes, as seen along the Colorado
River in Central Texas, inundation will create an
entirely new dynamic, reconfiguring the entire basin from pre-dam conditions. This will have profound effects on interpreting sites that may be
re-exposed during periods of low water, with concomitant loss of information regarding settlement
patterning and land and resource use.

Site Impacts
There are four main variables that will determine the extent of impacts to sites in reservoirs
(Lenihan et al. 1981:91-92). One variable is the
make up of the reservoir. Its area, its depth, the type
of watershed it is in, its orientation, and climatic
variation all combine to produce differing effects.
Next it must be considered where in the reservoir
the site is located. Sites at the shoreline will receive
more wave impact. Sites in deeper water will be
subject to greater siltation. Another factor is the
geologic and environmental history of the site.
Sites on unconsolidated material will be subject to
greater erosive forces. Slope, orientation, and types
of vegetation will also be factors. Finally, the type
of site and types of features in sites will be differentially more able to withstand destructive forces.
For instance, it is hypothesized that the pavement

Artifact impacts are dependent upon the class
of artifact. Perhaps most important is the effect of
wet-dry cycling upon various types of artifacts
(Lenihan et al. 1981:143). Ceramics, bone, pollen,
and shell are all affected to varying degrees. Lithics,
although not directly subject to chemical or physical
changes due to wet-dry cycling, may often have
their attributes altered. Use wear may be obscured,
or even produced, by movement through and across
ground surfaces (Will and Clark 1996:514).
Mechanical impacts on artifacts are therefore most
pronounced at the fluctuating shoreline.

BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSES
Biologically, the previously terrestrial ecosystem becomes aquatic (Lenihan et al. 1981:19). This
can include micro- and macro-faunal and floral
changes. Chemical changes are induced as well, as
water is superimposed and mixed with existing
strata.

Regional Impacts
The main concern is that the environment will
be completely changed. The result is that unless a
full physical and biological inventory is performed
before inundation, the comparative and physical
data base commonly used to reconstruct ancient
geomorphology and plant and animal communities
will be lost.

Site Impacts
Biochemical impacts are discriminatory in their
effects, and impact soil chemistry and stratigraphy
(Lenihan et al. 1981: 117). Elemental concerns are
primarily carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, and
calcium. It is well known, for example, that
concentrations of phosphorous can be an indicator
of living surfaces, as it is the by-product of organic
waste materials, and when found in large
concentrations indicates human refuse. When soils
are inundated, leaching and redistribution of

Malof-A Summary of Processes Affecting Archeological Sites in Artificial Reservoirs
phosphates can occur, with the resulting loss of
associated information. It is interesting, however,
that carbon remains suitable for Cl4 dating, as
charcoal does not appear to be tremendously
affected by inundation (Lenihan et al. 1981:179).
Other organic remains, though, are subject to
destructive microbial action until an equilibrium is
reached, often when anaerobic conditions begin to
prevail.

Artifact Impacts
Impacts to artifacts are also class-dependent,
and further complicating matters is the environment within which they are found (Lenihan et al.
1981: 147). Bone, for instance, may dissolve in
acidic conditions often found in anaerobic environments. Wood, seed, and pollen are all variably affected by the chemical constituents of their
respective matrices. In general, alkaline conditions
are more conducive to preservation than acidic conditions. Ceramics appear to reach an equilibrium,
with the most obvious effects being pitting and
fading of pigment. Low-fired ceramics may dissolve completely, while hard-fired ceramics maintain a great degree of integrity. Lithics, not
surprisingly, show little evidence of change due to
biochemical processes. Presently unknown, however, is the potential for changes in trace element
composition. The NRIS study was limited to a 20
year sample. Personal observations indicate some
lithics may take on a distinctive orange and black
patina in a 50 year reservoir, but that evidence is
not conclusive, as there was no comparative sample.

does intentional and non-intentional disruption of
sites. Loss of site information leads to the loss of
regional archeological information.

Site Impacts
These again range from the obvious looting or
collecting at sites, disruption of features for fire
rings or other, more esoteric uses, to changes in
land use patterns (Lenihan et al. 1981: 130). Once
remote areas may now be used for all terrain vehicles, hiking or biking trails, or camp sites. Many
of these activities can adversely affect sites.

Artifact Impacts
Selective collection of artifacts is the most obvious impact (Lenihan et al. 1981: 173). Once collected, they are gone from the record, and
associative information is lost. Pollution may effect
chemical values of soil matrices, and so also differentially affect preservation and dating.

MISCELLANEOUS PROCESSES
These are described as a multitude of impacts,
from new floral successional regimes, changes in
fauna! habits, and loss of site accessibility (Lenihan
et al. 1981: 19). These are primarily a combination
and function of the other factors under
consideration.

Regional Impacts
HUMAN PROCESSES
The primary impact is related to the increased
access to archeological sites (Lenihan et al.
1981: 19). This can be a direct impact, through land
use and collecting, or indirect, as in the result of
increased wave action due to boat wakes.

Regional Impacts
These impacts can be relegated almost entirely
to the same category as physical impacts. Humaninduced perturbations produce the same types of
disruptions. Increased wave action disrupts sites, as

Again, these impacts are related to site destruction. Once the site has been altered, it can no
longer be easily incorporated into the larger regional outlook.

Site Impacts
One example is the introduction of mussels to
newly inundated sites (Lenihan et al. 1981:133).
When water levels recede, these exposed mussel
beds are raided by raccoons, who create extensive
damage burrowing for this food source. The burrowing of the mussels themselves may create mixing in subsurface deposits. Other problems occur
with new successions of plant species. Salt cedar

566

Texas Archeological Society

can establish itself in shallow water, and completely
cover or destroy sites (Lenihan et al. 1981: 136).
These all create problems in interpreting the archeological record.

Artifact Impacts
Artifacts in freshly exposed soils are subject to
a variety of faunal impacts (Lenihan et al. 1981:174).
They may be damaged by cattle, or burrowing animals may dislodge and damage them. Rodents are
known to gnaw on bone and antler. Loss of vegetation due to submergence allows the redistribution of
artifacts and features. Encroaching invasive species
may alter soil profiles, and contribute to the disruption of artifact context and associations.

MITIGATION CONCERNS
Ideally, a reservoir will be inventoried prior to
its filling. Sites will be recorded during survey, and
assessed for intact stratigraphy, diagnostics, and
other indicators of research potential for information on prehistoric or historic lifeways. Added to
these assessments should be the long-term preservation potential for the individual site. For instance,
in the case of Lake Limestone in East Central Texas,
out of 62 sites, 11 were chosen for excavation
(Mallouf 1979). These sites were located exclusively in the deep water river channel in areas (with
one exception) of low impact potential. The exception was located at the upstream side of the dam
base, where construction activities would have destroyed the site. The sites chosen for excavation,
however, were all located along the edges of the
pre-dam river bed, and contained considerable archeological information. This selection process,
surely a painful one, meant that many sites located
on the edges of the soon-to-be reservoir were not
excavated, and therefore were subject to more intense processes of mechanical impacts. The issue is
complicated: should priority be given to excavate
sites that are to become relatively stable over those
with possibly a lower information potential, but
subject to greater degradation? If preservation is
factored into the equation, these choices may become easier.
Once a reservoir is established, which many
were prior to the enactment of antiquities laws, it
must be realized that a certain amount of damage

has been done. That information destroyed or
skewed by inundation must be taken into account
by the archeologist. In many cases, where reservoirs are subject to fluctuating levels, sites are documented or re-documented during periods of low
water. Some of these may be exposed for the first
time in years, and it is vital that the archeologist
recognize the possible impacts upon them.
The most important processes affecting sites
in fluctuating water basins are the mechanical. One
is left with the problem of determining how much
of the site has been left intact. In some cases, it
appears that previously unrecognized features are
now eroding out of new cut banks. At the Grelle
site (41BT1) in Burnet County, during a recent low
water event, a number of hearths were seen on the
river's edge (Lower Colorado River Authority
[LCRA] 1998). The site had been extensively excavated in the 1930s. These hearths were therefore a
new addition to the record of the site. This same
low water event exposed new features at 41TV1794,
also along the Colorado River (LCRA 1998), and a
series of surface hearths and middens at 41TV209,
at the south end of Lake Travis (Malof 1996). Or
did it? Etchieson and Couzzourt (1987:8-10) noted
that dissolution of underlying strata combined with
erosion created "new" features at Lake Meredith in
the Texas panhandle. In a 50 year reservoir such as
Lake Travis, it is entirely possible that varied rates
of deflation have caused deposits from dissimilar
deposits to collapse to a common plane, whereupon
they are subsequently reburied under sediment, only
to become re-exposed, providing the appearance of
an intact feature.
Only through experimental and experiential
research will this equation be clarified. This can be
accomplished through several means. Will and
Clark (1996) conducted an experiment in Maine
where they produced an artifact assemblage and
placed it upon the fluctuating bank of a natural
lake. They determined that artifacts would
redistribute themselves, typically upslope and in
the direction of current forces (Will and Clark
1996:515). They noted artifacts tended to cluster
around more permanent fixtures, namely large
embedded stones, and created the illusion of new
artifact clusters (Will and Clark 1996:516). Smaller
artifacts, such as flakes, became entirely displaced,
and further skewed the record (e.g., Lenihan et al.
1981:113). Unfortunately, dynamics affecting sites
and assemblages are as varied as site locations,

Malof - A Summary of Processes Affecting Archeological Sites in Artificial Reservoirs
resulting in an almost infinite number of variables.
It is for this reason that experimental designs should
be implemented with as much frequency as possible.
For instance, the Maine experiment involved an
established natural lake subject to icing some five
months of the year. The lake bed was formed of
gravels and cobbles (Will and Clark 1996:511).
This is dramatically different from typical
conditions in Central Texas, for instance, where
icing is virtually nonexistent, and shorelines tend to
be formed of deep alluvial deposits.
This site-specific set of circumstances requires
differing sets of research parameters. Ideally, a separate data base would be available for each site location. This is obviously not possible. In lieu of this
complete data base, a partial one must be established. As it grows, more information will be available for a variety of site locations.
Some of this work has already begun. At
41 B T305, on the shore of Lake Buchanan, a part of
the Colorado River chain of highland lakes, a representative selection of exposed hearths has been
carefully mapped by a transit (LCRA 1998). Although Lake Buchanan is not normally subjected to
wide fluctuations in water level, the study area is
on a low enough slope to enable exposure at minor
variations. When these features are once again exposed, they can be remapped, and any movement
will be documented. Similarly at 41TV209, on the
southern portion of Lake Travis, also part of the
Colorado River chain of lakes, a series of hearth
features has been drawn, photographed, and tied to
a central datum (Malof 1996). Re-exposure will
add information to sites situated in similar topographic surroundings.
Site documentation in similar circumstances
should include these types of data, so as to quantify feature and artifact movement through time.
Realistically, it is seldom that minor sites receive
this type of long-term attention, but if priorities are
shifted, valuable information may be gained that
can be applied to more significant archeological
sites.

SUMMARY
The processes affecting submerged sites are
variable and complex. Mitigation includes
recognizing factors affecting soon-to-be submerged
sites, recently exposed sites, as well as long

567

submerged sites. These factors include all levels of
the archeological record. Regional settlement pattern
studies are affected by site preservation, and site
interpretation is affected by artifact preservation.
Differential preservation on one level affects the
systemic interpretation of all others. In order for
such sites to be fully understood, a regional data
base must be established. This will only be
accomplished through experimental design and
careful documentation of existing sites. Publishing
such efforts may help to substantially increase the
amount of knowledge to be gained from otherwise
disturbed sites, and therefore add significantly to
the archeological resource base.

Task Selection of Lithic Raw Materials in the
Northern Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico
Jay R. Newman

ABSTRACT
The relationship between type oflithic material and task use is not always readily discernible. Technological,
functional, and availability considerations are clearly a significant component of raw material selection and
utility. Usually, particular raw materials are utilized and procured preferentially over other available materials
because they exhibit certain beneficial characteristics evident in tool production and/or utility. The lithic tool
assemblages of Pot Creek Pueblo (TAI-Mound Roomblock Unit 4, dating ca. A.D. 1250-1325) and the
proximal Cerrita pithouse site (ca. A.D. 1100) of the northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico provide the
rare potential for investigating behavioral selectivity in the procurement and use of a wide variety of local and
exotic raw materials. Overall, both assemblages exhibit similar lithic task selection patterns, with most of the
exotic materials significantly occurring in projectile points or occasionally fine bifacial forms. Further, the data
suggest trends in specific material morphological patterning in projectile points that appears to be due to artifact
scavenging and possible cultural/functional selectivity differences between locally available and exotic lithic
materials.

INTRODUCTION
The significance of the types of lithic material
from which a variety of tools are manufactured and
recovered from archeological sites is not always
readily apparent. Technological and functional considerations are clearly a crucial component of lithic
raw material selection and use. Presumably, particular materials are utilized (and procured) preferentially over other available raw materials because
they exhibit certain beneficial characteristics evident in tool production and/or utility. In addition to
these considerations, it is also feasible that the utilization of one particular material over another may
be incidental to, or a combination of, technological
factors, and utilization may also reflect particular
aspects of accessibility, social factors, and possibly
even random events. The ca. A.D. 1250-1325 lithic
tool assemblages of Pot Creek Pueblo (TAI-Mound/
Roomblock Unit 4; see Wetherington 1968;
Woosley 1980, 1986; Crown 1991; Crown et al.
1996; Adler 1996a, 1996b, 1997), and the nearby
settlement of the Cerrita pithouse site (dating ca.
A.D. llOO; Woosley 1980, 1986) of the northern
Rio Grande region of New Mexico are considered
in this paper because they offer the rare potential

for a high degree of behavioral selectivity in the
procurement and use of a wide variety of local and
exotic lithic raw materials.

METHODS
In an effort to assess potential patterns of material selectivity within and between the lithic tool
assemblages of Pot Creek Pueblo (focusing on the
TAl-4 lithic assemblage) and the Cerrita site lithic
collection, SPSSX Crosstabs procedures were run
to investigate the relationship of the major representative raw materials evident in the four basic
tool classes (points/drills, bifaces, unifaces, and
cores). These four artifact classes were selected
because they succinctly characterize particular behavioral traits associated with lithic material functional and economic utility and tool production.
Generally, projectile points reflect huntingpiercing (and possibly some cutting) activities that
maintain the potential to carry significant stylistic
information based on their flexible morphological
character. Bifaces are often more morphologically
and functionally generalized lithic forms that allow
for specific implement production through

technological reduction. Unifacial flake tools are
usually oriented toward hunting-cutting-butchering
tasks and scraping activities that are often more
casually manufactured. Cores, although often not
tools per se, reflect the primary stages of cobble
reduction used in the production of expedient and
informal flake tools. Cores generally represent a
less structured and informal technology that is not
particularly oriented toward lithic conservation,
instead representing a lithic waste-generating
technological strategy. The presence of significant
quantities of cores suggests that lithic procurement
is relatively easy, along with the ready access to a
lithic raw material, whether by exchange of whole
cobbles or cores (indirect access) or by direct access
and transport.

PATTERNS OF PREHISTORIC
LITHIC MATERIAL
SELECTIVE UTILIZATION
Geological sources of lithic raw materials
from which implements and tools are manufactured
are often known to have a unique and fairly specific distribution within any given geographical
region. Various lithic materials exhibit variable
physical properties that have the potential to affect
their suitability and utility for task-specific tools as
well as their utility in particular types of manufacturing processes. Lithic tool manufacturing and use
strategies are expected to vary according to several
considerations:
(1) spatial availability of materials in relation to

the spatial availability of other lithic and nonlithic resources; i.e., can a particular material
or set of materials be obtained while procuring
other resources within a particular exploitation-resource extraction strategy (Binford
1979; Carmichael 1983; Gould and Saggers
1985; Perttula 1984);

(4) distances to lithic material resources (Cameron
1984; Newman 1994; Perttula 1984; Winters
1984); and
(5) frequency and/or density of material(s) moved
via exchange relationships (Cameron 1984;
Munson and Munson 1984; Perttula 1984;
Vehik 1990).
A number of past studies have illustrated prehistoric patterns in lithic material task selectivity
(Cameron 1984; Dick 1965; Doyel 1991; Parry and
Christenson 1987; Perttula 1984). A variety of past
experimental studies have shown that the physical
characteristics of certain silicious materials impose
restrictions on the number and variety of reduction
strategies and techniques of tool manufacture
through which the materials can be successfully
rendered into practical tools (Carmichael 1983;
Chapman 1977; Peter and McGregor 1987, 1988;
Winters 1984). The reduction and production techniques of tools vary according to the internal finegrained consistency or "glassiness" maintained by
a particular raw material. Criteria of parent material size, shape, "softness," amount of cortex, presence of disconformities, and fracture quality (e.g.,
the presence of "bedding" planes) all affect the
quality-and hence the suitability--of a particular
material for certain physical tasks.
High-quality cherts and other lithic materials
were widely exchanged during many prehistoric
(and historic) periods throughout North America.
As in many examples, various materials were selected to serve special purposes or functions within
a prehistoric culture. Preferential material selection
reflects the fulfillment of technological, functional,
and possibly ceremonial-religious and/or status-related needs in prehistoric economies. The specialized role of preferential material selection should
be reflected in the differential utility of the material
in comparison to more readily available and locally
accessible lithic materials.

(2) suitability of particular materials for task-spe-

cific functions; that is, the physical characteristics of various materials that impose
constraints on their technological reduction and
use as tools (Cameron 1984; Chapman 1977;
Kerley and Hogan 1983; Schutt 1983);
(3) availability of alternative suitable lithic material resources (Perttula 1984);

and Cerri ta settlements (Figure 1; the two sites are
approximately 0.5 km apart). Cobbles and gravels
of high-quality chert occur on the ridges and slopes
of the Tres Ritos Hills above and around Pot Creek
Pueblo and the Cerrita pithouse site (Newman
1994:492). The cherts are predominantly derived
from the Mississippian Tererro Formation, although
they also occur within the underlying Espiritu Santo
Formation (Baltz and Read 1960; Sutherland
1963a), and within the overlying Pennsylvanian La
Posada Formation (Sutherland 1963b). The cherts
generally occur as gray, black, and white banded
nodules up to 25 cm in maximum dimension. Gray
and white banded chert lenses up to 1-2 m long and
25 cm thick occur near Ponce de Leon Springs,
about 1.6 km north of the Cerrita site (Baltz and
Read 1960: 1757). Various gray cherts occur as
rounded nodules representing up to 5 percent of all
nodules within the Macho Member of the Tererro

571

Formation; as large irregular masses (up to a meter
in size) of secondary chert within the Manuelitas
Member of the Tererro Formation; and as infrequent scattered chert nodules within the Cowles
Member of the Tererro Formation (Sutherland
l 963a:28). White to light gray chert occur in nodular beds up 30 cm thick within the Pennsylvanian
La Posada Formation.

Quartzites
Quartzite boulders, cobbles, and gravels are
common along the ridges and slopes above the
Cerrita site. These quartzites are predominantly derived from the lower quartzite member of the Precambrian Ortega Formation (Montgomery 1963).
The quartzite is typically massive, translucent, and
gray to white in color. Occasionally, it can be as

white as vein quartz; uncommonly, the quartzite is
mottled or streaked with iron oxide, shaded a smoky
gray-black, or at times, a pale blue-green. They are
remarkably pure, generally composed of 98 percent
quartz with a medium to coarse grain size (grains
on the order of 1 mm in diameter). The quartzite
tends to have a homogeneous, fused appearance,
rendering grain outlines invisible megascopically
(Montgomery 1963: 10). Alhough the fracture quality is rather poor, and the knappability rather restricted, the material can suffice for effective
unifacial flake tools in many instances.

Olive Drab and Black Shales
Pennsylvanian Magdalena Formation
micaceous olive-gray-green shales (Stark and
Dapples 1946:1143-1144) occur locally and are
readily available on the slopes and ridges behind
the Cerrita site. The rock usually occurs as relatively
thin (2-10 cm thickness) slabs or slab fragments,
although occasional irregular boulders (up to 20 cm
in diameter) of the material were observed to occur
(as "float") during a lithic material sourcing survey.
The rock is characteristically banded or streaked by
numerous minute black shaly laminae (of variable
thicknesses), within a dense, massive, and
compacted indurated sandy matrix that may grade
into a shaly sandstone. The rock also exhibits a
distinctive reddish-brown cortex or weathered
surface, which often fills the interior fractures of
the larger material blocks and block fragments, and
inhibits its conchoidal fracture quality. The breakage
pattern of individual "slab units" is of conchoidal
fracture, but the laminar structure and density of
the rock restricts this quality.
The "inhibiting" nature of the rock appears to
have restricted its use for tools to simple, informal,
and expedient unifacial flake tools and scraper
planes. A better quality homogeneous black shale
or slate is also available locally in limited quantities, and this material was utilized for a wider range
of lithic implements. These include various bifaces
and a limited number of projectile points.

EXOTIC LITHIC MATERIALS
Rhyodacite
Six spatially discrete rhyodacite sources are
scattered over the Taos Plateau. Four of the sources

provide a uniform, fine-grained, phenocryst-poor,
black to very dark gray rock (Newman and Nielsen
1987:263). The remaining two sources exhibit more
coarsely textured versions of the rock.
The high-quality rhyodacite is available at
Cerro Negro Mt. (just east of Arroyo Hondo), an
unnamed deposit east of Cerro Montoso (central
Taos Plateau), San Antonio Mt. (the northwest
Taos Plateau), and Ute Mt. (northeast Taos Plateau). The coarser versions of the rock are available at Tres Orejas Mt. (southern Taos Plateau),
and Guadalupe Mt. (just west of Questa).
Rhyodacite is readily identified macroscopically,
with a glassy, fine-grained ground mass that breaks
with a clean conchoidal fracture, occasionally exhibiting sparse phenocrysts. Rhyodacite occurs at
the sources as nodules (up to boulder size) and
gravels scattered over the surface and in buried
deposits. The rhyodacite sources are not apparently
affected by any substantial fluvial or erosional actions, nor do they appear to contribute to mixed
gravel deposits in the area. Cerro Negro Mt. is the
nearest high-quality rhyodacite source to Pot Creek
Pueblo and the Cerrita site (Newman 1994:493;
Newman and Nielsen 1987).

Brown Chalcedony
In addition to the locally available cherts, the
Manuelitas Member of the Tererro Formation also
occasionally contains a chalcedony. The closest
known exposures of this material occur in Gallinas
Canyon northwest of Las Vegas, New Mexico. In
the vicinity of Pot Creek Pueblo and the Cerrita
site, the Manuelitas (and the Cowles) Member has
been truncated by the extensive downcutting associated with the development of the Taos Trough
(Chapin 1981). The material (chalcedonite) exhibits excellent zoning with both solid and previously
fluid inclusions within the chalcedonic matrix. The
rock is usually a mottled red or red-brown to peach
in color, translucent in some areas, and often has
cortex on one or more surfaces, indicating the rock
is most often available as pebble gravels or in thin
seams (Newman 1994:493).

Cerro Pedernal "Chalcedony"
The Cerro Pedernal material occurs within the
bedded Pedernal Chert Member of the Tertiary
Abiquiu Tuff Formation (Smith 1938). The rock is

Newman - Task Selection of Lithic Raw Materials in the Northern Rio Grande Valley
available on the slopes of Cerro Pedernal Mt., San
Pedro Mt., at a number of other exposures along
the northern limits of the Jemez Mts., and in the
Chama River Valley (Bryan 1938, 1939; Smith
1938; Church and Hack 1939). Chalcedonic deposits have been followed for 32 km westward from
Cerro Pedernal and Mesa de Grulla to San Pedro
Mt. by Church and Hack (1939).
The material exhibits considerable variation in
color from white to gray through translucent or
black, with pinks, browns, yellows, and reds also
fairly common. It can often be spotted, banded,
streaked, or mottled with several colors evident.
The matrix exhibits recurrent small to moderate
open cavities and cracks in conjunction with occasional spherulites and small clusters of granular
quartz. The material is of excellent fracture quality,
and was used to produce a wide variety of lithic
tools (Newman 1994:493).
Dakota-Morrison Orthoquartzites
The Dakota-Morrison material is part of two
extensive geological units outcropping in several
areas in northern New Mexico and adjacent states.
The nearest available source for Pot Creek Pueblo
and the Cerrita site is apparently in the Chama
Valley around Mesa de Viejos, not far from the
sources for Cerro Pedernal material. Muehlberger' s
(1967) descriptive geological type section for the
Cretaceous Dakota Formation and the underlying
Jurassic Morrison Formation is located about 600
m west of the intersection of Willow Creek and the
Rio Chama in Chama Gorge. Ocate Mesa, east of
Las Vegas, New Mexico, is apparently an equally
available source.
The Dakota material is predominantly derived
from the upper and lower sandstone units of the
Dakota Formation, separated by a middle claystone
unit (which is apparently not present in all
exposures). The orthoquartzite is usually light gray
to gray-orange in color on a fresh surface, and
weathers to a pale orange-red to brownish-orange
color. The rock is massive, with grain size ranging
from very fine at the top of the unit to medium fine
at the base of the upper unit (Muehlberger 1967:74).
The sub-angular to sub-rounded quartz grains of
the rock are completely cemented by silica and are
clearly visible macroscopically, giving the material
a distinctive and readily identifiable appearance.
The orthoquartzite fracture quality is usually

573

excellent due to the high silica content, and
consequently the rock was useful for a wide range
of lithic tools (Newman 1994:494). The Morrison
Formation material found at Pot Creek Pueblo and
the Cerrita site is more frequently of a red/redbrown quartzite, that may not be evident in all
exposures of the unit.
Jurassic Morrison Formation materials have a
fairly wide geographical distribution similar to that
noted for the siliceous materials of the Dakota
Sandstone, which it often underlies (Dane and
Bachman 1965). Archeologically, the rocks have
been noted in lithic assemblages at least as far north
and as early as the Paleoindian Hanson site in
Wyoming (Frison and Bradley 1980), while also
apparently a common raw material in Chaco Canyon sites and related areas (Cameron 1981; Powers et al. 1983).
The Brushy Basin Member is the main geological unit of the Morrison Formation of interest
here, exposures of which exist from the Four Corners region into the Chama Basin on the basis of
lithological similarity and stratigraphic position
(Gregory 1938; Craig 1955; Cameron 1981). The
unit is predominantly composed of variegated
claystone with variable quantities of silt and sand.
Conglomeratic sandstone lenses are also common,
and include pebbles of deep red, green, white, black,
and yellow colors, all varying from opaque to translucent in hand specimen appearance.
The chalcedonic beds are widely distributed and
this Jurassic middle unit and key stratigraphic zone
has been documented in Colfax County, New Mexico
(Wood et al. 1953), Mora County, New Mexico
(Bachman 1953), western Kansas (Merriam 1955),
the Nebraska panhandle (McKee et al. 1956),
southern Wyoming (Pipiringos 1953), the Raton
Basin, Colorado (Johnson and Stephens 1954; Oriel
and Mudge 1956), central Utah (Stokes and Holmes
1954 ), and eastern Colorado (Duce 1924;
McLaughlin 1954; Ogden 1954). In Baca County,
Colorado, McLaughlin (1954:94) notes "the most
distinctive beds in the Morrison formation are thin
layers of red chert lying beneath the limestone... The
amber to red quartz and chert form irregular
nodules .... and were formed in place." In western
Kansas, Merriam (1955:34) commented that the
"chert is white to pink, some having a blue tinge,
generally translucent, and shows conchoidal
fracture ... some of the chert is chakedonic." In eastern
Colorado, Ogden (1954:914) notes that flesh-colored

574

Texas Archeological Society

to vermillion chalcedony is ubiquitous in irregular
rounded masses; this unit has been referred to as the
"welded chert" because of the resembiance of the
weathered surface to the rounded metallic beads that
result from welding. The unit may contain beds of
nearly pure carnelian or may include geodes up to 2
inches in inside diameter, lined with gray agate, drusy
quartz, and calcite crystals.
Where Jurassic rocks of the middle unit have
been differentiated from the immediately preceding
and following formations, a variety of names have
been employed, predominantly the Sundance,
Ralston, Wanakah, and Todilto, and less commonly
the Summerville and Curtis formations (Oriel and
Mudge 1956:22). Glenn and Chipman (1964:35)
mention that "agate" may be found in the gravels of
the San Juan River channel as well as in the gravels
of its higher terraces. The gravels contain white,
gray, blue, and transparent chalcedonic "agate" in
variable shades, patterns, and color bands. Patterns
include brown or black spots or bands, green to
blue-green coloring or inclusions, and various dendritic, "mossy," or "tube" designs (Glenn and
Chipman 1964:35). It is possible that these deposits
derive from the Bayfield Gravel and/or the
Bridgetimber Gravel of Atwood and Mather (1932).
They note that the Bayfield Gravel has "a great
variety of rocks and minerals ... represented. Quartzite of a bluish tint, milky-white quartz, dark-red
jasper, chert, flint, greenstone, and basalt are the
most common" (Atwood and Mather 1932:84). Regarding the Bridgetimber Gravel, Atwood and
Mather (1932:90) indicate that "the smaller pebbles
include in addition quartz, chert, flint, and jasper."

Polvadera Peak Obsidian
Polvadera Peak obsidian originates in the
Polvadera Group, which encompasses intermediate
volcanic formations of the basalt-andesite-daciterhyolite association, predominantly located in the
northern areas of the Jemez Mts. west of Santa Fe,
New Mexico. The obsidian derives from the El
Rechuelos Rhyolite, found in five small scattered
rhyolite domes and a small pumice cone in the
northern Jemez Mts. (Smith et al. 1970). The
Polvadera Peak obsidian unit occurs as a small,
isolated volcanic dome adjacent to the intersection
of El Rechuelos Draw and Polvadera Peak, 1.8 km
southwest of Polvadera Peak.

The obsidian is usually a murky, smoky gray
due to ubiquitous whitish phenocrysts within the
glassy matrix. The obsidian is usually easily identifiable in archeological lithic assemblages. Polvadera
obsidian occurs primarily as small pebbles and
cobbles, although larger nodules have been noted.
The obsidian-bearing unit is apparently restricted
to the obsidian dome itself and its immediate environs and does not occur in gravels or alluvial/colluvial deposits at lower elevations along the northern
fringe of the Jemez Mts. (Baugh and Nelson 1987;
Newman 1994:494; Newman and Nielsen 1985).
Obsidian Ridge
(Cerro Toledo) Obsidian
Cerro Toledo obsidian derives from the Cerro
Toledo Rhyolite of the Tewa Group, the most recent and Pleistocene volcanic unit of the Jemez
Mts. This group also includes the Bandelier Tuff,
Cerro Rubio Quartz Latite, and the Valles Rhyolite.
The Cerro Toledo Rhyolite contains frequent
pebbles and nodules (up to 25 cm diameter) of
obsidian within a lithophysal, gray lithoidal rhyolite matrix (Smith et al. 1970).
Cerro Toledo obsidian is usually translucent to
opaque black, occasionally containing small quartz
and sanidine phenocrysts. Opaque greens and
browns have been noted, and banded obsidian nodules have been found within the deposits (Newman
1994; Newman and Nielsen 1985). There are three
main known spatially discrete source areas: the volcanic domes of the Sierra de Toledo Mts. of the
Sierra de Toledo Caldera on the northeastern edge
of the Valle Grande; Rabbit Mt. on the southeastern
rim of the Valles Caldera; and the Rabbit Mt. Rhyolite-derived avalanche deposits (i.e., obsidian-bearing rhyolite tuffs and tuff-breccias; see Smith et al.
1970) of several of the ridges and canyons of the
Pajarito Plateau. The avalanche deposits include
the obsidian deposits of Obsidian Ridge (Newman
and Nielsen 1985), the obsidian deposits of Bland
Canyon (Warren 1979:57), Pueblo Canyon (Bailey
and Smith 1978:194), and the scattered obsidian
deposits of the high mesas along White Rock Canyon (Warren 1979:57).
Zuni Mts. "Leopard Chert"
One of the sources of this yellow, brown, and
black-spotted chert is Oso Ridge in the Zuni Mts.

THE TAl-4 AND CERRITA
MATERIAL TASK
SELECTION ANALYSES

Pink and gray water-laid rhyolite tuff cobbles
and fragments that are part of the Tertiary Picuris
Tuff (Cabot 1938), have been exposed in a number
of areas in and adjacent to the Picuris Range. The
closest and most accessible deposits are located in
Arroyo Miranda, the next valley west of the Rio
Grande del Rancho Valley and the Pot Creek
Pueblo and Cerrita sites. The rock is easily identified in hand specimens, being a deep reddish-pink
to medium gray in color, and often having fairly
large dark gray rhyolitic lenticular inclusions that
inhibit the material's fracture quality. A reconnaissance survey of this source area in the Arroyo
Miranda identified numerous quarry-workshop areas scattered along the valley floor where nodules

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the major high-quality
lithic materials evident in the TAl-4 and Cerrita
lithic assemblages. In terms of overall material
representation, TAl-4 and Cerrita are very similar
in that the local cherts and the exotic Cerro Pedernal
material represent the two most common lithic
materials in the two assemblages. By tool-debris
ratio percentages, Figure 3 indicates that TAl-4
and Cerrita are again very similar with the exotic
rhyodacites, obsidians, Dakota-Morrison materials,
and Zuni Mountains "leopard chert" (found only at
Pot Creek Pueblo) exhibiting high frequencies of
tools compared to debris. Cerri ta has a considerably
lower percentage value for Cerro Toledo obsidian
artifacts. The local cherts and the exotic Cerro

576

Pedernal material represent most of the materials
within the respective tool assemblages, with the
other materials having a roughly equal percentage
representation. The TA 1-4 tool assemblage does
have a higher percentage of Dakota-Morrison
material tools, while the Cerrita assemblage does
not contain brown chalcedony or Zuni Mountains
"leopard chert" tools (see Figure 3).
Formal tools are primarily made of more exotic lithic materials in the two site assemblages
(Figure 4). Other than the absence of Brown Chalcedony and Zuni Mtns. "leopard chert" for the
Cerrita site assemblage, the tool-debris profiles are
very similar. The very low tool percentage for the
Cerrita Cerro Toledo obsidian may be a product of
the small sample size (n=2) of this particular obsidian at the site. However, there are comparable decreased percentage values for the Cerro Pedernal
material in the two assemblages, indicating more
debris is represented than tools (see Figure 3). This
pattern is similar to that of the locally available
cherts, suggesting an enhanced access to the Cerro
Pedernal material.

In the chi-square analyses, I emphasize the
analysis of the pattern of residuals (the difference
between the expected and actual frequencies), as
they illustrate where the statistical independence
model breaks down. This approach amounts to comparing each observed frequency with its expected
value to assess which cells contribute most to the
chi-square statistic. Instead of using the obvious
subtractive differences, Everitt (1977) and Reynolds
( 1977) recommend computing and using adjusted
residuals whose values can be compared with percentiles of the normal distribution. Values greater
than 1.64 (the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution) suggest a significant discrepancy
between the observed and expected frequencies
(Reynolds 1977). Everitt (1977 :4 7) however, recommends using the 5 percent standard normal deviate (values greater thanÂ± 1.96) for a significant
adjusted residual value. Everitt's (1977) Â± 1.96 recommended value will be utilized in this paper. Values that are relatively large (greater than Â± 1.96)
point to "outliers" or frequencies that are far greater
or smaller than they should be under the model of
statistical independence. The benefit of this methodology is that by examining a model's fit cell by
cell, the significant elements (cells) can be identified
that contribute to the chi-square statistic and also
deviate significantly from expected frequencies.

The material selectivity analysis begins with
the examination of the relationship between tool class
and exotic (> 20 miles to lithic source) or local (< 20
miles to lithic source) lithic material of the Pot Creek
Pueblo Mound/Unit 4 assemblage. This analysis is
designed to evaluate patterns of lithic raw material
selectivity based upon a general distance to source
factor. In the material selectivity analysis, it is expected that cores of exotic materials will be minimally represented as they would be associated with
primary reduction activities and more inefficient and
wasteful lithic reduction technologies; primary lithic
reduction would occur at the source or associated
reduction location. Less obvious associations may
include more exotic material bifaces due to material
transport interests. This proposition is based on the
assumption that generalized-form bifaces would be
potentially more desirable for transportation, as the
form maintains greater flexibility in later stage lithic
reduction and tool production.

Newman -

Task Selection of Lithic Raw Materials in the Northern Rio Grande Valley

In a crosstabulation analysis of local versus
exotic material unifaces, points, bifaces, and cores
for the TAl-4 assemblage, a significant chi-square
value (339.23; significance=.0000; n==3145 tools,
1463 exotic tools, 1682 local tools; points= 125 local, 378 exotic; bifaces=330 local, 339 exotic;
cores=432 local, 98 exotic; and unifaces=795 local,
648 exotic) indicates that as expected, cores are far
more commonly represented by locally available
lithic materials (exhibiting a high positive adjusted
residual value [ARV] of 14.2), while projectile
points are far more commonly manufactured from
exotic materials (a high positive ARV of 14.0).
Bifaces of exotic materials also exhibit a significant high positive ARV (2.4), while unifaces exhibit an insignificant adjusted residual (1.7) for the
locally available materials.
It is interesting to note that nearly 26 percent
of the exotic material tools are projectile points
while 75 percent of the projectile points within the
TAl-4 tool assemblage are manufactured of exotic
raw materials. This is particularly significant due to
the fact that the locally available cherts are of excellent quality for the manufacture and use as projectile points. This phenomenon indicates that the
exotic materials were prefered for projectile points
regardless of qualitative material-functional criteria or accessibility factors.
The same Crosstabs chi-square analysis was
conducted on the Cerrita site tool assemblage with
similar results (chi-square==81.57; significance=.0000; n=583 total tools; exotic materials=210
total tools, including 73 unifaces, 75 points, 41
bifaces, and 21 cores; local materials=373 total tools:
135 unifaces, 45 points, 46 bifaces, and 147 cores).
The locally available raw materials (the cherts, Ortega
quartzites, black and green shales, etc.) tend to occur
as cores (with close to the expected ARV of 0.3 for
unifaces), while exotic materials appear to significantly occur as projectile points (ARV=6.8) or other
bifacial forms (ARV=2.3). Again, the exotic materials were apparently selected for, or procured as, projectile points or in some cases, bifaces. Thirty-six
percent of the exotic tool materials occur as projectile points; furthermore, 62.5 percent of the projectile points within the Cerrita tool assemblage are
manufactured from exotic materials.
In order to achieve a more detailed analysis of
the particular relationship between individual raw
material types and artifact class, an SPSSX chisquare Crosstabs program was again run with the

577

lithic materials categorized into the major individual
varieties of the TAl-4 assemblage. Table 1 illustrates the results with a chi-square=662.40 (significance=.0000). The obsidians (predominantly Cerro
Toledo and Polvadera Peak), rhyodacites, and the
Cerro Pedemal material are conspicuously represented by projectile points (with significant high
positive ARVs between 6.9-11.3), suggesting functional selectivity of these materials for projectile
point tool forms. This pattern is even more striking
for the obsidians and rhyodacites in view of the fact
that bifacial tool forms do not follow this high
residual tendency, possibly because completed projectile points, but not bifacial blanks, were predominantly being introduced into Pot Creek Pueblo
(Mound/Unit 4). The comparatively low frequencies of bifacial tool forms of the rhyodacites and
the obsidians further suggests that primary projectile point manufacture mainly occurred at a location other than the Pot Creek Pueblo site area
(TA 1-4). This particularly appears to be the situation in regard to the obsidians. This phenomenon
points to the fact that the obsidians and rhyodacites
may have been procured (and/or scavenged from
earlier archeological site deposits) in completed projectile point form, and/or manufactured off-site and
brought as complete projectile point forms to the
TAl-4 settlement.
In contrast, the Dakota-Morrison materials appear to be somewhat more widely represented within
the various tool classes based on ARVs between
0.5-5.0 for unifaces, points, bifaces, and cores. However, the red quartzite (Morrison) variety has a distinct tendency toward bifacial tool forms, indicating
either a functional selectivity (i.e., fulfilling a need
for bifacial cutting tools) for the lithic material or
perhaps more likely a transport/trade shape selectivity (i.e., efficient transport of staged bifaces as
potential sources of raw material) for the material
brought into the TAl-4 area of Pot Creek Pueblo.
Bifaces represent generalized shapes (as a raw material "package") that are more convenient and practical for trade and transport than other types of
cores or unmodified chunks of lithic material. The
analyses indicate that Dakota-Morrison bifaces were
primarily arriving at the TAl-4 settlement in completed form. This latter interpretation is further supported by the observation that a majority of the tool
forms of the Dakota-Morrison material within the
bifacial tool class are an ovate large, well-finished,
bifacial "knife." The "green chalcedony" material

appears to closely parallel this, as
bifaces of green chalcedony from
the Morrison formation also are
predominantly well-fabricated
bifaces (high positive ARV=3.3).
This also suggests transport/trade
shape/morphology selectivity. As
the green chalcedony exhibits no
inherent characteristics different
from the other chert or chalcedonic
raw materials, this shape characteristic is probably not functionally related or determined.
The high positive ARV (3.59.1) associated with cores of the
locally available materials (chert,
Ortega quartzite, black and green
shales) not surprisingly reflects
easy source access and the production of primarily simple and
expedient flake tools in the TAl4 pueblo area. The relatively
coarse-grained locally available
Ortega quartzites are restricted to
cores, simple flake tools, and
crude bifacial implements. The
more workable and higher quality
local chert materials are more frequently used for a wider range of
tools. The black and green shales
were used the same as the Ortega
quartzites (undoubtedly due to
their inferior quality).
For comparative purposes, the
Cerrita tool assemblage was subjected to the same SPSSX crosstabs
chi-square procedure as the TAl-4
tool assemblage. The chi-square
crosstabs values (Table 2) for the
Cerrita tool assemblage do not exhibit a comparable diversity for
lithic materials that had characterized the TAl-4 tool assemblage.
However, it is also evident that the
use of the various materials that
Cerrita has in common with TAl4 follows the same pattern.
To increase the sample size
within particular material type
groups for more reliable statistical
analyses, the obsidians, the

Dakota-Morrison quartzites, and the black and green shale materials
were combined into three different groups. The obsidians and
rhyodacites again appear to be favored for projectile points, based on
high ARV values (ARV=4.1-5.8). Cores are also again mainly
restricted to the locally available materials (cherts, Ortega quartzites,
and black and green shales). The Cerro Pedemal chalcedony appears
to have been favored for bifacial implements based upon the significant
positive ARV value (ARV=2.6). Though the chi-square significance
is not highly reliable due to the large number of table cells with
effective values less than 5 (47.2 percent), the expected values and
residual values are enlightening.
For a further comparison of the selective utilization of various
raw materials, the Pot Creek Pueblo Mound/Unit 6 tool assemblage

579

was also examined with the
SPSSX Crosstabs chi-square
procedure. This detailed analysis of the selective use of different raw materials from another
area of the Pot Creek Pueblo site
assessed the general applicability of the utilization pattern evident at TA 1-4 to the other
settlement roomblocks, to consider the possibility that different roomblocks may have had
differential access to exotic materials and/or differential material selective utilization patterns.
This analysis indicates that
the utilization of the various
materials at TAl-6 closely follow
the patterns evident at TA 1-4 and
the Cerrita pithouse site. Again,
given the large number of table
cells with effective values less
than 5 (27.8 percent), the chisquare statis-tical results may not
be reliable, even though the
expected frequencies and ARVs
are important. The obsidians and
rhyodacites (with significant
ARV values between 5.1-7.4)
occur in the tool assemblage
(n=999; total exotic materials=286; total local materials=713) primarily as projectile
points. In addition, an unexpected number of DakotaMorrison material projectile
points (ARV=4.6) are more
clearly apparent within the TAl6 lithic tool assemblage. The
TAl-4 and Cerrita tool assemblages had hinted at this
increased selectivity of the
Dakota-Morrison material for
points and bifaces with significant high chi-square ARVs, but
the TA 1-6 pattern is more clearly
evident (with higher positive
ARVs). The Cerro Pedernal
material utilization is again
somewhat more generalized with
high positive ARVs for points

580

(ARV=2.6) and bifaces (ARV=2.8). The local
materials are again conspicuously over-represented
within the core and flake tool forms. The flake tools
of local raw materials are also predominantly simple,
expedient forms. These patterns follow the TAl-4
results, indicating that the lithic selective patterns
and material access to these materials was similar
throughout the Pot Creek Pueblo settlement and
within the individual roomblock segments of the
site. As such, there is no material access or utilization
"hierarchy" within the Pot Creek Pueblo settlement.
The results of the various tool assemblage
analyses indicate that the selective utilization of the
diverse variety of available local and exotic materials was remarkably consistent. Part of this selective
process was undoubtedly tied to the inherent properties and characteristics of the individual lithic
materials themselves. It is not surprising to discover that the obsidians are selectively utilized for
projectile points given their fine edge characteristics and high quality fracture control. The same
situation characterizes the utility of the rhyodacites.
The Cerro Pedernal material presents a more
difficult utilization pattern to interpret. Although it
is an exotic, this lithic material occurs in greater
frequencies and exhibits a less restricted range of
utilization. There is a definite trend toward more
frequent projectile point and bifacial tool forms,
although the Cerro Pedernal material has no apparent inherent qualitative superiority or advantage
over the abundant and locally available high quality cherts. The only significant qualitative difference between the exotic Cerro Pedernal material
and the locally available cherts is the more durable
and more dense structure of the Cerro Pedernal
rock, which would provide longer lasting tools and
tool edges. The tendency of the Cerro Pedernal
material to be in projectile point or bifacial tool
forms may be because projectile points are primarily manufactured of any exotic materials.
In regard to the other exotic materials, this
trend toward points and bifaces may be due to
economic procurement-trade factors given the
scarcity of associated bifacial reduction and tool
manufacturing debris. However, the associated lithic
debris analysis (Newman 1997) indicates that the
Cerro Pedernal material more closely approximates
the local cherts in terms of technological factors
and its overall frequency (i.e., as an indicator of
procurement accessibility). As such, the tendency
toward projectile point and bifacial tool forms may

not necessarily be related to transport/trade
procurement factors. It may be instead that as an
exotic, the Cerro Pedernal material was more
frequently selected for projectile points (and bifacial
tools) than the equally suitable locally available
raw materials. This phenomenon appears to reflect
a situation where even more accessible exotic
materials (based upon material frequency within
an assemblage) were selected for projectile point
forms even though the material may not exhibit
any innate characteristic advantages or superiority.
The patterns of selection of the exotic Cerro
Pedernal material may be due in large measure to
the significant incorporation of projectile point/
bifacial tool forms through regular exchange
relationships or fairly consistent logistical
procurement during journeys associated with
additional products-the"embedded" procurement
of Binford (1979)-that brought materials directly
into the TAl-4 tool assemblage.
It appears to be the case that significant quantities of bifacial blanks of Cerro Pedernal material
were also incorporated into the TA 1-6 area of Pot
Creek Pueblo in view of the significantly greater
than expected (high positive ARV=2.8) frequency
of bifaces within the assemblage. Cerro Pedemal
bifaces constitute 25 percent of all Cerro Pedernal
tools, and 25 percent of the bifaces in the TAl-6
tool assemblage are of Cerro Pedernal material.
This data probably reflect basic modes of Cerro
Pedemal material import and tool production objectives, which also included completed projectile
points, as evident from the TAl-4 projectile point
data (high ARV=7.3) and the TAl-6 projectile point
data (high ARV=2.6). This phenomena indicates an
enhanced material access, perhaps as logistical direct procurement given the volume of points and
bifaces of Cerro Pedernal material, while the high
frequency and types of Cerro Pedernal debris suggests a more accessible procurement (e.g., possibly
indirect or "down-the-line" exchange). External interaction is suggested as bifaces represent optimal
morphological and functional "generalized lithic
forms" that allow for specific lithic implement production through technological reduction. Given the
high unexpected volume of bifaces noted within
the TAl-4 tool assemblage, additional procurement
factors appear to have been in effect. It appears that
the Cerro Pedernal material was associated with
enhanced accessibility within a regular and relatively high volume of raw material brought into the

Newman -

Task Selection of Lithic Raw Materials in the Northern Rio Grande Valley

Pot Creek Pueblo settlement, leading to a greater
material form and technological variability. With
the wide range and quantity of Cerro Pedemal material, conspicuous material waste does not appear
to have been a concern of Pot Creek Pueblo occupants. Intense economic activity with the Rio Chama
Valley appears to have been in place for TAl-4 and
Pot Creek Pueblo occupants.
The locally available black shales are suitable
for the production of projectile points and other
bifacial implements, although it is characteristically
a less durable and "softer" rock than the cherts. As
such, use of the black shales was mainly restricted
to crude bifacial implements, cores, and simple and
expedient flake tools. The green shales, due to their
tabular shape and inherently crude fracture qualities, were also restricted to crude cores and simple
and expedient flake tools. The same poor fracture
qualities of the relatively coarse-grained Ortega
quartzites limited its use to cores, crude (and apparently expedient) scraper planes, and simple and
expedient flake tools.
The Dakota-Morrison materials usually occur
as projectile points or bifacial implements (primarily finely finished ovates and ovate fragments),
although they are not found in any quantity (only at
Pot Creek Pueblo, along with a few flakes from the
Cerrita site). Given the relatively scant representation of Dakota-Morrison lithic material within the
debris assemblage at TAl-4 (and in all of the analyzed debris assemblages), these tool forms probably reflect procurement-trade activities rather than
being products of outright functional selectivity.
This is particularly the case for the well-finished
ovate bifacial tool forms because they represent
optimal morphological and technological "generalized lithic forms." These forms maintain the flexibility for the production of a wide array of other
specific tool forms. However, bifaces are not particularly efficient to transport in terms of exotic
material conservation given the relatively high volume of material waste associated with bifacial reduction technologies in tool production (Newcomer
1971 ). In regard to the projectile points, the Dakota-Morrison quartzites lack superior qualities for
the manufacture of, and use as, projectile points.
Since the locally available cherts are of superior
quality for the manufacture and use of projectile
points, the significant number of Dakota-Morrison
projectile points suggests that non-functional selective considerations were in effect.

581

The brown "chalcedonies" of the Sangre de
Cristo Mountain Range generally occur in a variety
of tool forms, but rarely as projectile points or
finished bifaces. In part, this curious absence may
simply be a product of their low frequency in the
lithic assemblages. Additionally, flaws and fractures are common throughout the matrix of the rock,
and it may have been avoided for the manufacture
of projectile points or other tools requiring any
kind of finely controlled flaking.
The Picuris Tuff (red and gray rhyolites) occurs in low amounts in most tool forms within the
TAl-4 assemblage, most commonly as crude bifacial implements and simple and expedient flake
tools. The occasionally large dark gray lenticular
rhyolitic inclusions that regularly occur within the
matrix of the rock inhibit very effective control in
the production of lithic implements, precluding the
consistent manufacture of finely made projectile
points or finely finished bifacial tools. The Picuris
Tuffs appear to have been introduced into the lithic
assemblages through an informal procurement that
was tied into other foraging activities in the vicinity
of a source for the material (probably the Arroyo
Miranda Valley just to the south of the Rio Grande
del Rancho Valley).
The exotic green "chalcedony" (DakotaMorrison) occurs only in low frequencies. Within
the TAl-4 tool assemblage, the material appears to
have been introduced primarily as finely finished
ovate bifacial forms. As in the case of the DakotaMorrison quartzites, the significant occurrence of
the material in finely finished ovate bifacial form
suggests that non-functional criteria, such as transport/trade considerations, affected the selectivity
and particular form in which this exotic material
occurs at Pot Creek Pueblo.
A quick review of the same analysis conducted
on the 1980-1981 Mound 6 lithic artifacts indicates
that the lithic use patterns discussed above are evident in other lithic assemblages from other areas of
Pot Creek Pueblo. The exotic materials distinctly
trend toward projectile point forms, while the local
materials are significantly represented in the cores
and simple flake tool forms.

PATTERNING IN PROJECTILE
POINT MATERIAL USE
Initially, a general crosstabulation analysis between local and exotic lithic material was performed

582

Texas Archeological Society

on the TA 1-4 projectile point assemblage
(as it has the largest and most variable
point sample of all the lithic tool assemblages) to assess the possibility of projectile point morphological patterning
by raw material. The results indicate
that point notching morphology (sidenotched, corner-notched, and triangular) differs by exotic versus local
material types in the TA 1-4 projectile
point
assemblage
(chi-square
value=l4.55; significance=.0007; sample
sizes: total projectile point sample=351;
exotic
materials=271,
sidenotched=133, corner-notched=18, and
triangular= 120; local materials= SO,
side-notched=27, corner-notched=O,
and triangular=53). The adjusted residuals for projectile points of exotic
lithic materials (the obsidians,
rhyodacites, Cerro Pedernal, and Dakota-Morrison) are high for notched
styles, either side-notched (ARV=2.4)
or corner-notched (ARV=2.4). Alternatively, the projectile points manufactured of locally available lithic
materials tend to be triangular in shape
(ARV=3.5). This same pattern is noted
in the next largest projectile point
sample from the TA1 Mound/Unit 6
excavations.
A more detailed attempt to define
possible projectile point morphological
patterns and relationships with the various lithic materials was undertaken with
the detailed breakdown of the local and
exotic materials into the individual raw
material types in the assemblages. The
TA 1-4 results of the SPSSX crosstabs
chi-square procedure are presented in
Table 3.
The adjusted residuals indicate that
the obsidians (significant positive
ARV=5.5) have a significant frequency
of comer-notched projectile point
shapes, comprising 65 percent of the corner-notched points within the sample and
19 percent of the obsidian points. The
rhyodacites tend to be side-notched projectile point forms (ARV=2.2), with this
form accounting for 57 percent of the

projectile points manufactured of rhyodacite and 24 percent of
all the side-notched point forms in the TAl-4 projectile point
sample. Alternatively, the locally available cherts tend to occur in triangular projectile point forms (ARV=3.5, compared
to -2.3 to -2.5 ARVs for side-notched and comer-notched
forms). The Cerro Pedernal material projectile points and the
Dakota-Morrison projectile points do not exhibit any particular morphological associations, and do not contribute significantly to the chi-square values.
An analysis of projectile point dimensional attributes
(surface area analysis) indicates that the optimal projectile
point size at TAl-4 was between 2.0 and 4.0 cm in surface
area. For the TAI-4 point assemblage, Cerro Pedernal points
tended to be generally smaller in surface area size than points
of other materials. The TAl-6 projectile point assemblage
(and the Cerrita site assemblage) showed that the obsidians
also tended to be smaller in surface area size, possibly evidence
for consistent morphological patterning. It is intriguing that
the two different roomblock areas (and the Cerrita site) of Pot
Creek Pueblo (TAl-4 and 6) had the same small size patterning
for two different exotic material types, which may have
economic, procurement, and/or morphological style
implications. The question of geologically available raw
material size is probably not a factor here, as both the Cerro

Newman -

Pedernal material and the obsidians occur in a wide
variety of sizes from pebble-gravels, through
cobbles, to large nodules (and seams of material in
the case of the Cerro Pedernal material). However,
a far more detailed projectile point analysis than
that presented here is required to establish this
possibility.
CONCLUSIONS
Overall, all the assemblages exhibit similar task
selection of lithic materials, with most of the exotic
materials occurring significantly in projectile point
form (rhyodacites, obsidians, and Dakota gray
orthoquartzites) or bifacial forms (late-stage manufacture Dakota-Morrison red quartzite, Dakota gray
orthoquartzite, brown chalcedony-green chalcedony, and leopard chert). The Cerro Pedernal chalcedony is an anomalous exotic material among all
of the lithic assemblages because it was used for
tools in the same way as the locally available cherts.
Cerro Pedernal materials appear to have been readily
procured at Pot Creek Pueblo, and was far more
accessible than any other exotic material, including
the more proximal rhyodacite material. The main
reasons for the increased accessibility of Cerro
Pedernal material appear to have been an unencumbered direct access and/or the increased indirect
access to the material through "down-the-line" exchange.
The locally available materials in the assemblages were used remarkably the same: the lower
quality materials (Ortega quartzites, black shale,
and green shale) generally occurred in core or simple
unifacial flake tool forms indicative of primary core
reduction technology and casual flake tool production. Although not apparent in the crosstabulation
table analyses, the lower quality local material
bifaces in the assemblages also tend to be crude
early-stage bifacial forms, further indicating the primary reduction technological activities associated
with these materials.
In terms of projectile point morphological patterning, the significant trend toward corner-notched
forms for the obsidian projectile points appears to
relate to the apparent habitual scavenging of projectile points from earlier archeological lithic assemblages within the Rio Grande del Rancho Valley
and the Northern Rio Grande area by the occupants
of Pot Creek Pueblo. Observation of the obsidian
corner-notched projectile points (and most of the

583

other comer-notched points as well) indicates these
forms represent or approximate known Archaic period projectile points in morphology (although the
recycling with heavy edge refurbishing has often
resulted in arrow point size ranges for the obsidian
projectile points). In addition, several of the obsidian corner-notched projectile points are well
patinated, and some exhibit more recent retouching, suggesting that the obsidian comer-notched
varieties were probably scavenged dart points from
Archaic period sites encountered in the area by
later Puebloan populations (probably hunting parties or similar foraging task groups). The lithic debris analyses (Newman 1997) are also pertinent in
that they document the relative scarcity of obsidian
debitage, and that minimal primary and secondary
reduction activity and tool production was taking
place at TAl-4 with the obsidian lithic materials.
The introduction of significant numbers of complete obsidian projectile points (and probably other
classes of tools) is compatible with the limited evidence for lithic reduction and modification debris.
Furthermore, the incorporation of "older" obsidian
into the TA 1-4 lithic assemblage, and the wideranging nature of the available obsidian hydration
dates (Newman n.d.; Ridings 1991 ), is understandable in view of the projectile point data morphological analysis.
The Cerrita pithouse site projectile point assemblage also had SPSSX crosstabs chi-square
analysis. Unfortunately, the projectile point sample
(n=l21) for the site is comparatively small because
of the restricted site size and the relatively short
occupation. However, the obsidian projectile points
also tend to be comer-notched point forms (with
significant ARVs), indicating the same scavenging
of earlier Archaic period obsidian artifacts as noted
at Pot Creek Pueblo. Low artifact frequencies preclude any further reliable statistical evaluations or
demonstrable morphological patterning of projectile point forms within and between the various
lithic materials.
One of the most notable aspects of the
tabulations for the analyzed assemblages is the
conspicuous absence of definitive Plains-derived
lithic material. Only five flakes from TAl-4 may
be from the well-known and well-documented
Alibates agatized dolomite source of the Texas
panhandle (due to this extremely low frequency,
these artifacts were tabulated as miscellaneous and
not included within the current analyses). Definitive

answers to the question of Plains-Pueblo interaction
from the A.D. 1000-1350 period (the approximate
occupation span of the Pot Creek Pueblo TAl-4
and TA 1-6 assemblages; the Cerri ta pi tho use dates
to A.D. 1000-1200) should probably not entirely
rest upon an analysis of lithic assemblages alone.
Nevertheless, it appears to be the case that in terms
of lithic material exchange, and perhaps in terms
of general economic interaction, relations between
the eastern New Mexico and Southern Plains
groups and Rio Grande del Rancho Valley
populations were negligible.

Peyote: The Divine Cactus, by Edward F. Anderson. 2nd Edition, University of Arizona Press, Tucson,
1996. xiii + 272 pp.

Reviewed by Carolyn E. Boyd

Anderson's second edition of Peyote: The
Divine Cactus is, without doubt, the most
comprehensive text available on Lophophora
williamsii, the peyote cactus. For thousands of years
humans have used peyote for its psychoactive
properties, medicinal qualities, and as a sacrament.
Although there have been numerous articles and
books written on the subject, none are as thorough
and accurate as this book. Anderson has presented
a technical, yet clearly written discussion on
virtually every aspect of this unique cactus and its
significant relationship to Native Americans.
Anderson begins by providing the reader with
a review of historical documents relating the earliest descriptions of peyote use in Mexico as recorded by the Spanish in the 1500s. He follows
with accounts by explorers of the late 1800s and
early 1900s, including Carl Lumholtz, R. M. Zingg,
and W. C. Bennett, and more recent research conducted by P. Furst, B. Myerhoff, and S. Schaeffer.
He has also provided condensed descriptions of
peyote ceremonies conducted among Native American groups in Mexico, such as the Huichol and
Tarahumara. These ceremonies are then contrasted
with a newer form of peyotism that arose in the
southern United States and spread rapidly throughout Indian reservations across the nation during the
second half of the 19th century.
The author provides an excellent introduction
into the controversy surrounding the origins of the
modem peyote religion. This new form of peyotism
differs significantly from the peyote complex of
Mexico, as it contains numerous aspects of Christian symbolism and elements of traditional culture
associated with Native American groups in the
United States. He presents a brief discussion on
various origin theories for the modern peyote religion. One of the theories Anderson addresses is
that mescalism (the mescal bean medicine society)
predates, and perhaps even led, the development of
peyotism in the United States. The seeds of the
Texas Mountain laurel (Sophora secundiflora),
"mescal bean," have been utilized by some Native

American groups in ritual contexts. It has been
speculated that the mescal bean was employed as a
hallucinogen in these rituals prior to the discovery
of the psychotomimetic properties of peyote. Although Anderson presents a very fine discussion of
the human utilization of the mescal bean, he failed
to include an important reference regarding the alleged hallucinatory qualities of the seeds of
Sophora secundiflora. Hatfield et al. (1977:374)
provide an extensive discussion on this topic, concluding that there is no evidence that any of the
mescal bean alkaloids are capable of directly inducing hallucinations. Mescal beans, however, do produce a variety of physiological effects, including
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle paralysis, delirium, convulsions, insensitivity to pain, coma, and
even death.
Another important reference not mentioned in
Anderson's book is that ofF. Ruecking, Jr. (1954).
Ruecking describes ceremonies conducted by the
Coahuiltecan Indians of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico during the early historic period
(1528-1800) that involved the ceremonial use of
peyote during the 1600s. He suggested that "peyote
was first placed in a ceremonial setting by the
Coahuiltecan peoples" and that "the peyote complex was diffused from the Coahuiltecan area to
other groups of Mexico, who modified the original
setting, and the modem peyote cult spread in much
later times to the United States" (Ruecking
1954:337). Although I disagree with Ruecking' s
conclusions that peyote was first placed in a ceremonial setting by the Coahuiltecans, it is important to recognize that the ceremonial use of peyote
was observed in the region during the 1600s, 280
years prior to the formalization of the modem peyote
religion in the United States. Therecent identification of peyotism in the 4,000 year old pictographs
of the lower Pecos River region of southwest Texas
and northern Mexico adds further questions as to
the origin and antiquity of peyotism, both in Mexico
and the United States (Boyd 1996, l 998a, 1998b;
Boyd and Dering 1996).

Texas Archeological Society

Anderson's overview of the "divine cactus"
also includes a detailed description of the peyote
user's experience, the pharmacology of peyote, and
its chemistry. His chapter entitled "The Peyote
User's Experience" provides descriptions of experiences reported by Europeans and European immigrants, not the experiences of Native Americans
utilizing peyote in a religious context. This is a
very informative chapter for individuals interested
in the psychotomimetic or hallucinogenic properties of the plant, but who do not wish to experience
its effects first-hand. The chapter discussing the
chemistry and pharmacology of peyote provides
the reader with a clear understanding of the various
alkaloids present in the plant, and the physiological
effects associated with each of these alkaloids. It is
very important to remember, however, that peyote
is not used for recreational purposes among Native
American groups. Peyote is both the prime sacrament whereby the participants in sacred ceremonies can communicate with God and an important
medicinal plant. As Anderson states (p. 106), "Native Americans have discovered a wide range of
products to serve as pharmacopoeia, and one of the
most treasured substances in this 'medicine cabinet' of herbs and roots is peyote."
Included in Peyote: The Divine Cactus is an
excellent discussion on the medicinal uses of the
plant. Anderson presents not only the extensive
medicinal uses of peyote by Native Americans in
Mexico and the United States, but also the early
uses of peyote by Anglo-Americans. His discussion
emphasizes the therapeutic application of peyote
and the lack of distinction between medicine and
religion among many Native American groups.
Anderson's review of the botany of peyote is
refreshing. It is well written and extremely informative. He covers at great length the botanical history of peyote, clarifying considerable confusion
surrounding the botany of the cactus and plants
commonly confused with peyote. This chapter also
includes the biogeography and ecology of peyote,
in addition to information on the evolution, cultivation, and conservation of this unique and controversial plant.
The concluding chapter of the book presents
the legal aspects of peyote. Anderson covers the
history of legislative efforts to control peyote use,
beginning with the efforts by the Spanish Inquisition
in the 16th century to prohibit its use among Native
Americans in Mexico. He then brings the reader up

to date on the most current laws regarding peyote
use by indigenous and non-indigenous people.
Anderson (p. 207) states that "it seems the use of
peyote in Native American religious practices
should be safe from persecution in the future."
Based on recent communications I have had with
members of the Native American Church, I am not
as confident as Anderson. It seems that this will be
a battle they must continue to fight in the courts
throughout the years ahead. Although Anderson is
optimistic about the increasing tolerance of Mexican
and U.S. governments concerning the use of peyote
by Native Americans, he is pessimistic about the
long-term survival of natural peyote populations.
Over-harvesting resulting from legal and illegal
collection of the slow-growing cactus, and the
destruction of peyote plants through root plowing
to facilitate cattle-grazing, have severely threatened
peyote populations in Texas. Anderson calls for
protection of the cactus from illegal collection and
the cultivation of new peyote populations.
Anderson has presented the reader with not
only an excellent introduction to peyote and its
cultural significance, but also has provided extensive references for individuals interested in further
researching this remarkable cactus. Peyote: The Divine Cactus will be a valuable contribution to the
libraries of not only archeologists and anthropologists, but also botanists, theologians, lawyers, pharmacologists, chemists, folklorists, and historians.

This book, a learning and act1v1ty book
apparently aimed at older grade-school-aged
children, is intended to provide an introduction to
the lifeways of Texas Indians. Author Zappler, art
director Elena T. Ivy, and consulting editor Juliann
Pool succeed admirably in their task.
Because this book is intended for children, the
contributors have presented the information in the
form of a coloring book. Aesthetically speaking,
this book is remarkable. A glance at the full-color
cover (a smaller version of the enclosed pull-out
poster) gives the reader a hint of the artistic quality
found throughout. Every page is lavishly illustrated
with line drawings by Ivy, and even adults will find
themselves turning back again and again, only to
find new details with each examination. The cover
(and hence the poster) is the best example of this. It
incorporates the people and culture of multiple tribes
in a composite "village" scene; hidden among the
many figures and scenic elements are examples of
motifs from the rock art of Texas.
Most of the rest of the pages are illustrated in a
narrative fashion, in that the action portrayed in the
drawing is followed closely by the text. Numerous
visual elements added throughout the book keep
this narrative approach from being boring. For example, on a page discussing the treatment of indigenous people by Europeans, Ivy has woven together
several elements of post-contact life (e.g., missions,
fur traders, guns) using an intertwined rosary. This
creative approach can also be seen in a discussion of
storytelling, where Ivy portrays a narrative within a
narrative by simultaneously portraying the act of
storytelling and the storyteller's tale. Miniature drawings of Texas in the upper left corner of each page
include a shaded area depicting the relevant part of
the state for the activities or people being discussed.
This small but important touch provides context for
each time period and indigenous group presented, as
well as continuity. Given the beauty of the illustrations, it is s a pity that the pages are not perforated to
better allow adequate display of completed artwork
in the proper format (i.e., on the refrigerator).

Readers concerned with current political sensitivities will be relieved to know that the history and
use of the term "Indians" is described on the first
page of the narrative. This discussion is important
because it provides a historical context for the use of
the word, and presents an excellent opportunity for
parents and teachers to embark on a discussion of
historical circumstance and modern insight into the
contact process. Additional crucial background to
the study of indigenous groups is provided in a
section on the arrival of the first Americans via the
Bering Land Bridge. Again, the author's decision to
include this information provides an important framework for beginning students.
Several games are included in the book, and
range from shape recognition ("shadow matching")
to word games (including a cross-word puzzle and
a word-search). Creative activities include instructions for drawing a buffalo story hide, and making
a woven mat and a medicine pouch. All of these
activities and games are carefully planned to reinforce concepts presented in the text.
One minor criticism of the book concerns its
discussion (or lack thereof) of gender-specific
toolkits. Despite careful use of gender-neutral terms
throughout the rest of the book, Zappler includes
separate illustrations of women's and men's toolkits
in his discussion of Archaic lifeways. Unfortunately,
a prehistoric division of labor based on sex is not
discussed at all in the text. While few anthropologists would deny that there are tools that are used
more commonly by men or women, to present
toolkits as static entities based solely on an
individual's sex is oversimplified and misleading.
Toolkits were presumably highly individualized and
task-specific, and may have changed depending
upon immediate and long-term needs. This illustration would provide an ideal opportunity to discuss
traditional gender roles in prehistoric and modern
times; however, the book itself falls flat in this
area, leaving the task to teachers or parents. This
flaw, however, is a relatively minor one that can be
easily overcome by informed and involved adults.

Another curious point about the text is the
pronunciation of certain tribal names. These are
presented phonetically for the convenience of the
reader; however, several of these pronunciations
are quite unlike those typically heard in Texas parlance (e.g., HOR-na-da instead of hor-NA-da
[Jornada]; ah-TACK-ah-pahns instead of a-ta-KAPans [Atakapans]). It is difficult to tell whether the
forms presented by Zappler are idiosyncratic, regional, or indigenous pronunciations (or whether,
as a non-Texas native, I have been maliciously
misinformed). Again, this is a very minor point, but
one which might cause some confusion should uninitiated readers attempt to enter discourse with a
typical Texas archeologist.
A final critique concerns the lack of a preface
or introduction. A preface would be aimed primarily at adults, but this seems appropriate for two
reasons. First, adults typically provide the money
to purchase children's books, and therefore often
have a great deal of influence on the books their

593

children read. Secondly, a brief introduction that
provides further sources of information and discusses the goals of the book would encourage interaction between adults and children. Additionally,
no information is given as to the target audience.
As a whole, it is certainly appropriate for older
school-aged children, but some of the projects could
be easily modified for younger children. This kind
of guidance would be helpful not only to parents,
but to primary educators interested in using the
book as an educational tool.
The merits of this book far outweigh its minor
flaws. Zappler and colleagues do a very nice job of
balancing informative text with beautiful illustrations, clearly described projects, and thoughtful
games. My recommendation to potential buyers of
this book is to buy more than one. Give them to
sons, daughters, nieces, nephews, and neighbor's
children. Don't forget to buy one for yourself, then
go buy the biggest box of crayons you can findyou '11 need them.

Plains, and Northern Mexico, Volume I, by Scooter Cheatum and Marshall C. Johnston with
Lynn Marshall. Useful Wild Plants, Inc., Austin, 1995. xxi + 568 pp.

Reviewed by J. Phil Dering

Wow! This is just not another descriptive guide
to useful wild plants. The organization, illustration,
and readibility of the book guarantee it a place in
the library of every professional or avocational botanist, archeologist, or anthropologist. Let me put it a
different way: there is no other publication on economic plants that is more useful to archeologists
working in south central North America. In fact,
this work is superior to any comparable volume
currently in print anywhere in the world.
What sets Cheatam, Johnson, and Marshall's
work apart from the rest is its thoroughness. Volume I alone treats 86 genera, beginning with
Abronia and ending with Arundo. Each species entry provides a physical description of the plant that
refreshingly includes not only the floral parts but
also the vegetative parts, especially the subterranean parts often overlooked by botanists. The text
is accompanied by an excellent color photograph of
the plant, a beautiful map illustrating its distribution, a discussion of common names and, of course,
the economic application of each plant.
Information is quickly and easily accessible
because each species treatment is formatted with
notes and keywords in the margins. Another useful
research tool is the very detailed index, that
includes most of the common names known for
each of the plants, providing a quick guide for
readers working at any level of expertise. The
authors explain how each plant is used for food,
fuel, medicine, as a tool, and numerous other
applications. Information on each plant is
synthesized from multiple sources, including
botany, ethnography, history, food nutrition and
food technology, chemistry, and popular works on
edible plants. A gold mine of information, the
bibliography alone stands as an excellent source
for the researcher. Discussions of the archeological
literature provide a time depth for the use of the
plants seldom noted in botanical publications.
Characterizations of each species detail the use
and preparation of each part of the plant, often

including taste tests by the authors. The extensive
discussion of medicinal uses is often accompanied
by the chemical basis for its reported activity.
Consider, for example, the section devoted to
Agave, that covers 35 pages and includes eight distributional maps and 13 color photographs. Detailed descriptions of the eight species of Agave
growing in Texas contain a thorough presentation
of synonmy, common names, habitat, and geographic distribution. Economic uses are also welldocumented. The discussion of Agave preparation
includes pit-baking the central stem or heart of the
plant, baking pit construction, fuels used, time required for cooking, and rituals associated with cooking. Secondary processing is described in detail,
including extracting and drying the pulp from the
central stem and leaf bases, making the different
kinds of dried pulp cakes, and cooking the pulp
cakes. Several beverages composed entirely or partially of agave, including aguamiel, tesguino, tiswin,
sugui, mescal, mescal bacanora, and tequila are
discussed. Preparation of the emerging flower stalk
and flowers, including the collection and consumption of nectar, is also presented in detail.
Uses noted for agave fiber include construction of rope/twine, netting, paper, textiles, belts,
bags, roofing, walls, and lashings. Agave stalks are
used for ramadas, walls, spear and arrow shafts,
musical instruments, and fire drills. Agave pulp has
even been pounded into armor. The authors also
report several potential economic applications of
agave: as a source of steroids, paint, waterproofing,
and fuel; 24 medicinal uses of the genus are also
described. Although many of these references extend to plants distributed beyond Texas and adjacent areas, they serve to round out one's
understanding of the potential of the plants located
within the immediate study region, many of which
have been greatly understudied. Multiply this thorough coverage by 86 genera (over 250 species in
all), and the reader gets a sense of the immensity of
the book's undertaking.

Further, the volume invites the reader to enter
the world of those who study and use plants.
Discussions are often sprinkled with anecdotal
details provided by the authors' personal
experiments or field encounters with the plants.
Many humorous accounts relate the preparation of
plants and the many taste tests conducted by a panel

595

of participants. Therefore, the book serves a dual
role-both as an easily accessible reference, and as
a very enjoyable casual read. Three cheers for the
best effort on economic plants available today! I
recommend that you add the book to your library
and watch closely for the next volume.

Tejano Journey, 1770-1850, edited by Gerald E. Poyo. University of Texas Press, Austin, 1996. Illustrated
by Jack Jackson, maps by Ana Carolina Castillo Grimm. xvi + 186 pp.

Reviewed by Sergio A. Iruegas

The chapters in this edited book were initially
presented in March 1993 as papers in a St. Mary's
University (in San Antonio) sponsored conference
entitled "Tejano Identity, Resistance and Accommodation, 1770-1860." Designed to explore the
Tejano journey as Spanish subjects, Mexican citizens, independent Texans, and citizens of the United
States, the end result of the conference was a deeper
awareness of the Tejano contribution to the settlement and development of Nuestras Tierras Tejanas.
Emphasizing a strong emergence within the
last five years of pre-1860 Texas' Mexican American historical studies, the editor (p. xiii) states in
the Introduction that: "The story of Tejano integration into the United States has traditionally been
told from the perspective of Euro-American immigration to Texas and conflicts with Mexico; Tejanos
themselves have been mostly absent from the story."
Through their silence about local Tejano communities, most sources imply that Tejanos were irrelevant to the region's destiny. The truth, however, is
that Tejanos influenced events significantly and
acted out of their own traditions in diverse and
complex ways to defend and promote their perceived interests. Poyo lays the foundation of the
book's central theme in the first chapter ("Community and Autonomy") in describing the struggles of
the cabildo of San Antonio de Bexar with the Spanish interim governor and the community's quest for
autonomy and self preservation.
Throughout the book, the different authors relate how the Tejano residents exercised their autonomy and acted in their own best interest, while
under the Spanish, Mexican, and Texas flags. For
example, Andres Tijerina discusses the newly
formed department of the state of Coahuila y Tejas
in 1824, highlighting the development of coalitions
between political leaders from these territories as a
means to preserve their autonomy. Conversely, in
separate chapters, Steven L. Hardin, Timothy M.
Matovina, and Paul D. Lack explore the difficult
decisions faced by Tejanos in the 1830s: join the
separatist Texian movement, remain neutral, or fight

against brothers and the mother country. Wanting
autonomy to control their own destinies, many
Tejanos lent their military expertise to the separatist cause. Others feared they would receive less
respect for their autonomy and culture by the rebel
Texians (mainly immigrant Anglo-Americans) and
chose the lesser of two evils, siding with General
Santa Anna.
The Tejano response to world events is another relevant theme explored in the first two chapters of the book (authored by Poyo and Jesus F. de
la Teja, respectively). When Napoleon invaded
Spain in 1808 and forced Carlos IV to abdicate his
crown, the arrest of Spain's heir apparent, Fernando
VII, led Tejanos to question their loyalty to a deposed King and instead act in their own best interest. Solidification of the town council autonomy
was almost guaranteed when the Tejas provinces
accepted the Constitution of 1824 that was established in Spain during the absent reign of Fernando
VII. The government established under this constitution allowed the provinces in New Spain to elect
local officials and send them to Mexico City to
participate in a government that gave wide latitude
for local decisions. The concept of a decentralized
government permitted the Tejanos to control their
own economic and personal destinies. When King
Fernando VII regained his crown and abolished the
mechanism that served the interests of the Tejanos,
rebellion broke out in the provinces. This set the
standard for local Tejano autonomy through Mexican and Texas independence that has lasted to the
present day.
The Tejano journey documented in this book
was mainly economic, specifically the cattle industry that developed in South Tejas after 1770, and
the expansion of trade relationships between eastern Tejanos and the United States after the latter
purchased the Louisiana territory in 1803. Archeologists interested in the historical archeology of
Texas's Spanish Colonial period, the Republic of
Mexico period, the Republic of Texas period, and
the Early Statehood of Texas period will find this

book fodder for the broader examination of the
18th and 19th century Tejano's place in the world

Establishing Exceptionalism: Historiography and the Colonial Americas. An Expanding World,
Volume 5. Edited by Amy Turner Bushnell. Variorum, Brookfield, Vermont. xxv + 372 pp.

Reviewed by Joan E. Baker

Contrary to its title, Establishing
Exceptionalism, a part of the "Expanding World"
series, sets out to "disestablish exceptionalism" (p.
xxiii) and lead researchers towards a new PanAmericanism. This is a response to the common
notion that one must take a regional perspective of
the European influence in the New World because
each region is the historical product of a unique set
of circumstances. Considering the diverse nature of
the native peoples of the Americas and the disparate
origins of the colonial players, this outlook is not a
surprising one. Bushnell, however, argues that
historians have forsaken the forest for the trees. Her
objective is to provide a broader framework by
demonstrating social, ideological, and historical
commonalities in European interaction in the New
World. Paradoxically, she attempts to do this by
presenting a series of articles that focus on particular
colonial powers and regions. As Greene and Pole
(p. 210) note in their chapter, and the reader is
bound to discover on his or her own, the problem
with using a regional approach-especially given
the stated purpose of this book-is the difficulty of
tying the separate observations together, particularly
when each area is handled by a separate author.
The key to using this book as a research tool
lies in understanding the meaning of the term historiography; otherwise, the hapless reader might be
led to think that this book is about the history of the
Colonial Americas. In fact, historiography is the
study of the way in which history is written. This is
a discipline heavy on theory, perception, and revision, and light on historical narrative. Given this
knowledge, canny historical archeologists can use
this book, and others like it, as a springboard for
research design and analysis, as well as a sort of
check on current perspectives in historical research.
Another factor to bear in mind is the nature of
this compilation, for it is most certainly and
unabashedly a compilation of 13 previously
published articles rather than an edited volume of
original research. This volume draws heavily from

The William and Mary Quarterly and American
Historical Review, and presents widely cited articles
written by established researchers. This strategy
makes the book akin to the photocopied packets of
reading materials required by many college
professors for undergraduate and graduate seminar
classes. At times, the reader may wish that the book
came with a syllabus, or better yet, an informed
instructor. Bushnell's brief introduction, while
providing a historical perspective of the discipline's
changing climate, does little to tie the chosen articles
together. Several of the chapters (e.g., Greene,
Chapters 3 and 10; Rule, Chapter 2; Wood, Chapter
4) seem to be little more than collections of book
reviews, while another (Weber, Chapter 12) is a
retrospective on the life and career of a leading
historiographer (James Bannon).
The order in which the chapters are presented
is somewhat mystifying as well, since they do not
seem to be organized temporally (e.g., by historical
era or publication date), regionally, or by colonial
power. Unfortunately, the book lacks coherence; it
is more appropriately read as a series of independent articles, since that is their origin. Even this
approach to reading can be a challenge, however,
because the average archeologist is apt to lack the
background needed to decipher references to longstanding debates in the field.
The organization of the book makes reading
slow work, but at the same time, the value of this
volume lies in the editor's penchant for articles that
contain lengthy critiques of work by leading
historical researchers. This puts a wealth of
bibliographic data at the archeologist's or historian's
fingertips. To her credit, the articles chosen by
Bushnell touch on the full spectrum of European
colonial powers (including England, Spain, the
Netherlands, and Portugal) and other participants
in the "settlement" of the New World (Native
Americans, African and Asian immigrants). Thus,
whether the reader's interest lies in Colonial Dutch
America or early African-American history,

Establishing Exceptionalism provides a starting
point for a literature review.
Because each article has been reprinted from
the original, the chapters retain the original font,
headers, and page numbers, supplemented by new
headers and page numbers. Some articles rely
heavily on footnotes for bibliographic and supplemental information, while others have bibliographies at the end of the chapter. This lack of
standardization eventually becomes distracting and
can, at times, make it difficult to locate the desired
information or citation.
Like many books directed toward specialists
in a particular field, this book contains a fair amount
of specialized vocabulary and code words. As anyone who has read an archeological site report knows,
the use of excessive jargon does not necessarily
mean that the theories expressed are poorly researched or ill-conceived, it simply makes the ideas
contained therein less accessible. Greene's discussion of interpretive frameworks in American colonial history, for example, contains a description of
the "core-periphery dichotomy" used to develop a
"distance decay spectrum" of "Europeanness" (p.
255). Kicza talks about the utility ofprosopography,
while Greene and Pole (p. 211) refer to the
gemeinschaft-gesellschaft model. In some cases,
context provides the necessary definition, while in
others, a good dictionary is a necessary tool. Occasionally, one is simply left to wonder. Ironically,
Weber (p. 329) notes that "clear language [is] favored by most historians", as opposed to "the more
recondite idioms of [non-historians'] disciplines."
With an eye to interdisciplinary research,
several authors acknowledge archeological and
anthropological contributions to history and
historiography. Kicza, for example, notes that
ethnohistorians have changed the shape and
direction of social history in Latin America. He
also points to work by the late Linda Schele and her
colleague, Mary Ellen Miller, as an important and
exceptional advance in the field of Mayan studies.
Merrell' s references to outdated dichotomies (e.g.,
civilization versus savagery) in his discussion of
the American Indians' colonial experience will be
familiar territory to anthropologists, as will his plea
for increased attention to the important role of
Native Americans in the development of the New
World. In particular, Merrell points out the need for
interdisciplinary research in this area, incorporating
folklore, linguistics, and archeological studies.

599

Weber echoes Merrell's sentiments concerning
Native American perspectives in his criticism of
Bannon's early work.
Also along anthropological lines, Lockhart presents a unique and somewhat surprising analogy in
his description of the biographical technique. In it,
he compares the use of ordinary people's life histories to the use of skeletons in physical anthropology, in that only a few of either are needed to draw
meaningful conclusions. Physical anthropologists,
however, might take exception to Lockhart's assertion that "a few skeletons are as good as several
hundred"!
A few of the chapters are notable for the insights they provide into particular areas of colonial
societies. For example, Kicza provides a shrewd,
if brief, comparison of the character of Spanish-Indian interaction in Latin America and that of English colonialism in North America, as well as
similar observations concerning slavery in the New
World. Zavala makes an important point about the
origins and elastic nature of similarities and differences in the people and cultures involved in the
colonization of the New World. Commerce, language, religion, and legal systems in particular afford rich comparisons in Zavala' s view. He is also
the sole author to acknowledge the influence of
Oriental trade routes and Asian immigrants on
Spanish and Portuguese colonies. Weber uses his
retrospective look at Bannon's career to provide
valuable insights into several areas of Spanish colonialism. In particular, his discussion of the contextual meaning of the term "Borderlands" will be
valuable to beginning students, focusing as it does
on spatial and temporal aspects of the debate.
Weber also uses critiques of Bannon's early and
highly Eurocentric work to demonstrate changing
viewpoints towards the impact of colonialism on
Native Americans and the growth of the discipline
as a whole.
Perhaps the most readable and interesting piece
in Establishing Exceptionalism is the closing chapter, written by Altman and Butler. This chapter,
written with the Quincentenary in mind, provides a
kind of blueprint for holistic studies. It includes an
excellent discussion of the social, economic, and
biological reactions of indigenous populations to
European contact. For example, the authors note
that in the case of tribes from eastern North America,
trade was an equal and voluntary process, in which
Native Americans pitted European competitors

600

Texas Archeological Society

against each other in order to advance their own
interests. Altman and Butler also use examples from
Cabeza de Vaca's narrative to explore the value of
anemic perspective in explaining seemingly bizarre
responses by indigenous peoples to the arrival of
Europeans. Commerce, religion, ecological change,
territoriality, and land use are among the topics
explored by Altman and Butler. In closing, they
offer many insights into the apparent success of
Europeans at the expense of other groups in the
Americas (including Africans and native peoples).
This chapter is highly recommended for its easy
style of writing, contemporary viewpoint, and skillful handling of North and South American history.
Despite the generally disjointed nature of the
selected articles, a few central issues crop up repeatedly. A number of authors call for community
histories. While acknowledging the contributions
made by those using standard historical documents
(e.g., colonists' reports to distant sponsoring governments), they point out that there is much to be
gained by using individual and business records
(e.g., diaries, trade inventories) in combination with
more standard sources. This inductive technique
will yield important information on rarely addressed
issues, such as sex roles, parenthood, and the structure of households. In particular, increased attention to the role of "invisible" groups of people (e.g.,
slaves, servants, rural inhabitants, African Americans, and Native Americans) is necessary for an
enhanced view of New World colonial history. This
strategy also emphasizes the need to view the colonial experience in terms of trans-culturation rather
than acculturation (see Greene, Chapter 10).
Another common thread in this book is the
criticism of New England-centered models of
European colonialism. As Greene and Pole (p. 213)

put it, "(W]e will have to move beyond an
appreciation of regional differences to an emphasis
upon important similarities that in themselves served
as important underlying unities that make it possible,
indeed necessary, to conceive of these separate
regions as parts of a larger ... [colonial] world."
Fortunately, several of the chapters contain
comparisons and categorizations of the different
colonial regions and/or governments. This is useful
for those who wish to gain a perspective on the
"exceptionalism," or lack thereof, of the colonial
Americas.
Finally, the consensus of the authors seems to
be that two primary factors drove colonialism.
First, the colonists were in pursuit of material benefit through the exploitation of natural resources.
Often, of course, these "natural resources" included
members of an indigenous or imported population.
The second driving force was the desire to create a
society similar to the one left behind, albeit without some of the more disagreeable aspects of the
original. The success or failure of a colony in these
pursuits depended upon a number of factors: social,
environmental, political, cultural, and economic, to
name a few. Some of these factors were unique to
a given situation, others were common to all such
endeavors, and still others were conditional. Not
surprisingly, the interactions between these elements of success provide ample material for theoretical debate.
This book can be useful to historical archeologists and other non-historiographers interested in
colonial history, but it requires diligence, patience,
and a healthy attention span. While this book may
be invaluable to historiographers as a compilation
of the classics, it does little to make the field approachable to outsiders.

Of Bison and Man, by Harold P. Danz. University Press of Colorado, Niwot, 1997. 231 pp.

Reviewed by Doug Land

In his book, Of Bison and Man, Harold Danz
has done an admirable job of addressing one of
America's most beloved and little understood wild
animal, the American bison. Almost entirely lost
to extinction in the late 1800s, the great herds of
buffalo, as most observers tend to refer to them,
made a tremendous comeback with significant assistance and dedication from preservation resource
managers like Ron Thiel of Wyoming, the many
National and State Parks, and the author. Harold
Danz was himself a long-time National Park Service employee and former executive director of the
American Bison Association, and who better to
write about the Bison?
For those interested in American archeology
and the study of Indian cultures, Mr. Danz inserts
novel ideas, such as: to know the bison is to know
the Indian. Although his information on the emergence of Early Man in the Americas is somewhat
out-dated, part of that story is eloquently laid out as
it relates to their hunting of Bison. Mr. Danz also
discusses the cultural beliefs of some of the tribes.
For example, he describes how Yell ow Haired
Woman helped the Cheyenne learn to plant corn,
and introduced them to the hunting and practical
uses of bison in the early days of starvation. He
describes how the Great White Buffalo stood as
"Big Medicine" for many Indians. Some folktales
were so sacred and so secret that the medicine man
felt obliged to offer a prayer asking for forgiveness
before he began.
The behavioral habits of bison are quite fascinating, particularly when they are confronted by
natural adversaries and catastrophic situations, including attacks by wolves and grizzly bears, and
danger from fires, blind stampedes, river crossings,
blizzards, and lightening strikes. The bison, however, could pretty well take care of himself. The

author reports, as an example, an Indian witness to
a fight between a large bull bison and a fierce
grizzly bear, concluding: "Even after the bear was
dead, the bull would gore the carcass and sometimes lift it clear of the ground on his horns. He
seemed insane with rage, and notwithstanding the
fact that most of the skin was torn from his head
and shoulders, appeared to be looking around for
something else to fight" (p. 71).
Even though the bison's power is astonishing,
man proved to be their only real threat. Mr. Danz
describes that episode in great detail. This book
takes the reader through the experience of the Bison slaughter, tells the reader how the bison survived, addresses today's status of the bison and
management of the remaining herds, and gives the
author's thoughts on where this wonderful resource
is going in the future.
Each chapter is well balanced as to technical
information and is well researched, especially for
the astute student of the past 300 years of American
history. Mr. Danz carefully intertwines written observations of the many early travelers that came
into contact with bison during that period. For the
general reader, information is easy to comprehend,
well thought out in construction, and written to a
level that is neither too detailed nor too complex.
In short, Of Bison and Man is a welcome addition to the mounting subjects and collection of material associated with Plains anthropology/
archeology and the real-life history of America and
its people. Mr. Danz tells it like it was, with no
holds barred. This book is highly recommended for
all types of readers, especially those interested in
American Indian culture, the mountain man/fur
trade period, wildlife management, and Western
romantics. Mr. Danz lists many excellent references
for further reading and study.

pull-out poster.

Reviewed by Joan E. Baker

This book, a learning and activity book apparently aimed at older grade-school-aged children, is
intended to provide an introduction to the lifeways
of Texas Indians. Author Zappler, art director Elena
T. Ivy, and consulting editor Juliann Pool succeed
admirably in their task.
Because this book is intended for children, the
contributors have presented the information in the
form of a coloring book. Aesthetically speaking,
this book is remarkable. A glance at the full-color
cover (a smaller version of the enclosed pull-out
poster) gives the reader a hint of the artistic quality
found throughout. Every page is lavishly illustrated
with line drawings by Ivy, and even adults will find
themselves turning back again and again, only to
find new details with each examination. The cover
(and hence the poster) is the best example of this. It
incorporates the people and culture of multiple tribes
in a composite "village" scene; hidden among the
many figures and scenic elements are examples of
motifs from the rock art of Texas.
Most of the rest of the pages are illustrated in a
narrative fashion, in that the action portrayed in the
drawing is followed closely by the text. Numerous
visual elements added throughout the book keep
this narrative approach from being boring. For example, on a page discussing the treatment of indigenous people by Europeans, Ivy has woven together
several elements of post-contact life (e.g., missions,
fur traders, guns) using an intertwined rosary. This
creative approach can also be seen in a discussion of
storytelling, where Ivy portrays a narrative within a
narrative by simultaneously portraying the act of
storytelling and the storyteller's tale. Miniature drawings of Texas in the upper left corner of each page
include a shaded area depicting the relevant part of
the state for the activities or people being discussed.
This small but important touch provides context for
each time period and indigenous group presented, as
well as continuity. Given the beauty of the illustrations, it is a pity that the pages are not perforated to
better allow adequate display of completed artwork
in the proper format (i.e., on the refrigerator).

Readers concerned with current political
sensitivities will be relieved to know that the history
and use of the term "Indians" is described on the
first page of the narrative. This discussion is
important because it provides a historical context
for the use of the word, and presents an excellent
opportunity for parents and teachers to embark on a
discussion of historical circumstance and modern
insight into the contact process. Additional crucial
background to the study of indigenous groups is
provided in a section on the arrival of the first
Americans via the Bering Land Bridge. Again, the
author's decision to include this information provides
an important framework for beginning students.
Several games are included in the book, and
range from shape recognition ("shadow matching")
to word games (including a cross-word puzzle and
a word-search). Creative activities include instructions for drawing a buffalo story hide, and making
a woven mat and a medicine pouch. All of these
activities and games are carefully planned to reinforce concepts presented in the text.
One minor criticism of the book concerns its
discussion (or lack thereof) of gender-specific
toolkits. Despite careful use of gender-neutral terms
throughout the rest of the book, Zappler includes
separate illustrations of women's and men's toolkits
in his discussion of Archaic lifeways. Unfortunately,
a prehistoric division of labor based on sex is not
discussed at all in the text. While few anthropologists would deny that there are tools that are used
more commonly by men or women, to present
toolkits as static entities based solely on an
individual's sex is oversimplified and misleading.
Toolkits were presumably highly individualized and
task-specific, and may have changed depending
upon immediate and long-term needs. This illustration would provide an ideal opportunity to discuss
traditional gender roles in prehistoric and modern
times; however, the book itself falls flat in this
area, leaving the task to teachers or parents. This
flaw, however, is a relatively minor one that can be
easily overcome by informed and involved adults.

Another curious point about the text is the
pronunciation of certain tribal names. These are
presented phonetically for the convenience of the
reader; however, several of these pronunciations
are quite unlike those typically heard in Texas parlance (e.g., HOR-na-da instead of hor-NA-da
[Jomada]; ah-TACK-ah-pahns instead of a-ta-KAPans [Atakapans]). It is difficult to tell whether the
forms presented by Zappler are idiosyncratic, regional, or indigenous pronunciations (or whether,
as a non-Texas native, I have been maliciously
misinformed). Again, this is a very minor point, but
one which might cause some confusion should uninitiated readers attempt to enter discourse with a
typical Texas archeologist.
A final critique concerns the lack of a preface
or introduction. A preface would be aimed primarily at adults, but this seems appropriate for two
reasons. First, adults typically provide the money
to purchase children's books, and therefore often
have a great deal of influence on the books their

603

children read. Secondly, a brief introduction that
provides further sources of information and discusses the goals of the book would encourage interaction between adults and children. Additionally,
no information is given as to the target audience.
As a whole, it is certainly appropriate for older
school-aged children, but some of the projects could
be easily modified for younger children. This kind
of guidance would be helpful not only to parents,
but to primary educators interested in using the
book as an educational tool.
The merits of this book far outweigh its minor
flaws. Zappler and colleagues do a very nice job of
balancing informative text with beautiful illustrations, clearly described projects, and thoughtful
games. My recommendation to potential buyers of
this book is to buy more than one. Give them to
sons, daughters, nieces, nephews, and neighbor's
children. Don't forget to buy one for yourself, then
go buy the biggest box of crayons you can findyou '11 need them.

This three-part volume on behavioral
archeology publishes papers from a 1992 Society
for American Archaeology symposium, plus papers
invited afterward. Part I, along with the editor's
introduction, takes stock of 20 years of behavioral
archeology. The theme in Part I is to summarize
what behavioral archeology is, correct
misunderstandings, and celebrate its successes and
prospects. According to the editors, the principles
of behavioral archeology are: (1) all inferences in
archeology explicitly or covertly invoke laws (the
Hempelian proviso); (2) sociocultural phenomena
can be studied without reference to or invocation of
mental (i.e., intentional) states (the Skinnerian
proviso); and (3) archeology studies the
relationships between behavior and artifacts in all
times and all places (the universal proviso). A
chapter by Jefferson Reid elaborates on these
principles and the overarching research strategies
within which to apply them. In a useful discussion,
Reid emphasizes that although studying formation
processes is indispensable, it is not to be pursued
for its own sake, but as a precursor to reconstructing
behavior. However, Walker et al. note that the
diversity of examples of behavioral archeology in
the present volume is broad, so the Walker et al.
and Reid chapters in tum raise the question (as
Alison Wylie does in Part III) of whether behavioral
archeology actually is a distinctive archeology. If
the principles need not be included in a behavioral
archeology, the answer is no (as Michael O'Brien
and Thomas Holland note in Part III). Because there
is too much to talk about in the volume as a whole,
I will focus here on the distinctiveness issue because
it is the volume's raison d'etre.
In a chapter on the demise of the early electric
car, Michael Schiffer analyzes behavioral
archeology's ability to pursue social theory and
history where the latter is construed as an ideographic rather than nomothetic enterprise. Schiffer
notes that early gas and electric cars had performance properties making the former better for rural
owners and touring urbanites, but the latter better

for use in purely urban settings. Although Schiffer
invokes a "Swiss army knife" principle and an
"Imelda Marcos hypothesis" to show that gas cars
generally were better for families that could not
afford two cars, these devices count as laws only if
we use the term "law" in the loosest of inappropriate ways. Moreover, a footnote in Schiffer' s data
table shows that his analysis depends entirely on
assumptions about how people at the time judged a
car's performance properties. Thus, if Schiffer's
case is plausible (and it is), it is plausible despite
violating the Skinnerian proviso, if not also the
Hempelian one.
William Rathje's chapter on his ongoing garbage project rounds out Part I. Rathje has developed
some principles of waste, among them Parkinson's
law of waste: the amount of garbage disposed expands to the volume of the receptacles used to dispose it. Probabilistic laws such as these are
problematic. The fact that my wife and I use a 90
gallon trash bin to discard about 25 loosely packed
gallons of garbage a week confirms the law because
our behavior is consistent with it. But, we do not
obey the law, and it does not explain our behavior
despite our confirmatory role. In fact, Rathje's study
violates the Hempelian proviso unless the "laws"
governing trash disposal in societies with trash-collecting specialists actually are laws and actually
apply in all places and all times, both of which are
highly dubious (as Randall McGuire notes in Part
III). More interestingly, Rathje has shown that selfreported beliefs about trash conflict starkly with the
actual content of landfills. Rathje takes this fact to
show that: ( 1) archeology has the potential to contribute directly to public policy (something it should
do more often), and (2) this potential follows from
archeology's capacity to put beliefs to a test of their
accuracy. But the latter is a definitively non-Skinnerian enterprise. Thus, Rathje's study, like Schiffer's,
achieves what success it achieves by abandoning
central behaviorist provisos.
Behaviorist case studies in Part II show where
behavioral archeology is going: "Architectural

(Axel Nielsen); "Ceremonial Trash?" (William
Walker); "The Clay Pot: An Exploration of

Schiffer); "The Estimation of Prehistoric Values:
Cracked Pot Ideas in Archaeology" (Louise Senior);
"Ceramic Reuse Behavior among the Maya and
W anka: Implications for Archaeology" (Michael
Deal and Melissa Hagstrum); and "The Analysis
of Domestic Reuse in Historical Archaeology"
(Douglas Wilson). However, as with the Schiffer
and Rathje studies, the behaviorist provisos are
scarce here.
Three case studies deal at least partly with
ideological matters that usually would be considered
problematic for behavioral archeology. Of these,
only Nielsen's sustains a close affiliation with the
Skinnerian proviso. He argues (correctly; see Ellis
1998) that any archeological study of meaning or
symbolic content must start with inferences from
artifacts to behavior before it can move to the
intentional side of the equation. But, he also argues
that the intentional realm is too epistemically muddy
to get much out of studying it. Walker presents a
conceptually and empirically intriguing case that
sacred artifacts are used and discarded in what he
calls a "singularized" path distinct from secular
artifacts. The pattern seems convincing enough to
serve as a middle-range device for archeological
analysis, but it starts with a fundamental violation
of the Skinnerian proviso. By starting with
documentation of how self-professed Catholics,
Jews, Muslims, and others discard what they regard
as sacred objects, his case is front-loaded with a
distinction based on intentional states (see Putnam
[1975] for a historically decisive analysis
concluding that behaviorism in psychology must
fail because it cannot escape intentional states). At
the other end of the scale, Senior shows that some
kinds of pots are repaired more frequently than
others. Although she undoubtedly is right that this
follows from the higher value of some kinds of pots
relative to others, she directly implicates an
intentional state as the cause of different repair
rates, the ultimate Skinnerian sin. Moreover, even
if it is true that type x pots are more valued than y
pots, this statement is accurate only because it is
nearly devoid of content. If we do not know what
the value was, we do not know much about the
cause, and to discover this requires another betrayal
of the Skinnerian proviso.

605

The Hempelian proviso also fares poorly in
the case studies. For the life of me, I could find no
existing laws being invoked or new laws being
developed. The patterns of reuse developed in
Wilson's chapter are law-like only because they
express definitional rather than empirical relations,
just as Schiffer' s (1976) early legislative acts expressed definitional relations between the elements
of lithic technologies and archeological records
containing lithics (Salmon 1982). While Deal and
Hagstrum provide an important set of interpretive
caveats on the relationship between the systemic
effects of ceramic reuse and the formation of archeological assemblages, their data do not support
basing laws on their ethnographically documented
patterns. In an examination of 37 classes of reuse
among nine groups, no class of reuse occurs in at
least 50 percent of the cases. Even in a much larger
cross-cultural sample, a recurrence pattern of less
than 50 percent is hardly the stuff of laws, even
statistical ones. The Skibo and Schiffer chapter
fares better because its claim that we can identify
female potters is based on broad ethnographic
foundations. However, to say that potters at site S
were female because pottery making was organized
at a household level invokes not a law, but a correlation referring only too and to nothing more than
a pattern. As classical empiricists, positivists, and
statisticians since Hume have noted, a correlation
is only a correlation, and correlations alone do not
weigh much.
If the chapters in Parts I and II represent behavioral archeology as a distinct archeology, that
distinctiveness does not rest on the Hempelian and
Skinnerian provisos, and expanding archeology to
include last week's garbage under the universal
proviso does not fill the gap. Wylie's (1981; Ellis
1998) analysis of law-finding and law-testing in
archeology shows that Binfordian and Schifferian
positivist rhetoric masks an anti-positivist practice
that emphasizes the identification of causes that
explicate the content of the archeological record to
explain the systemic, and other, processes that make
the record what it is when we dig it up. While this
volume is poor in the application of behaviorist
principles, it nonetheless is rich in cause-finding
exercises. The behaviorists claim to be distinct from
the processualists, but neither cause-finding nor the
provisos distinguish them.
Part III of the volume is a collection of nonbehaviorist papers presenting, well, non-behaviorist

takes on behavioral archeology. McGuire
("Behavioral Archaeology: Reflections of a Prodigal
Son") argues that behavioral archeology is an
approach in which method has been elevated to the
level of theory. Thus, the behaviorist method of
reconstructing behavior is a large-scale tool. Wylie
("An Expanded Behavioral Archaeology:
Transformation and Redefinition") echoes this, and
suggests that behavioral archeology is virtually
completely detached from its original premises other
than its commitment to reconstructing behavior as
the first step toward interpretation. Charles Orser
asks the empirical question "Is There a Behavioral
Historical Archaeology?", and answers no because
most historical archeologists have largely ignored
the behaviorists. The reality of historical practice is
that historians (like Binfordians and behaviorists)
are cause-finders, and few historical archeologists
have shared (and, thus, been distracted by) the
behaviorists' interest in laws, an interest that
McGuire notes has gone unfulfilled in any event.
Hence, at the level of practice, behavioral
archeology is not distinct from, say, a
Collingwoodian historical approach because this too
is predicated on finding behavioral evidence from
which to infer the purposes that play causal roles
guiding action. This is, of course, not to say that
behavioral, processual, or historical archeologists
investigate the same aspects of the past. It is to say
that once behavioral archeology is exposed as little
more than a directive to find behavioral causes, it
can be attached to any theoretical program, just as
radiocarbon dating can be used in any theoretical
program. Distinctiveness fades even further.
O'Brien and Holland ("Behavioral Archaeology and the Extended Phenotype") and Alan
Sullivan ("Behavioral Archaeology and the Interpretation of Archaeological Variability") do not
share behavioral archeology's optimism that behavior can be reconstructed, let alone that such
reconstruction is a necessary first step in archeological interpretation. In both cases, the authors say
that behavioral reconstruction is plagued by problems of equifinality that cannot be overcome. However, as Wylie argues, this emphasis on equifinality
is itself overdrawn, and not matched by any assurance that the O'Brien/Holland and Sullivan alternatives are not similarly afflicted once one adopts
their overly skeptical epistemic standards.
The O'Brien/Holland case is especially inter-

esting from an epistemic perspective (Wylie's take
on this is insightful). Having coupled their
selectionist approach to a highly skeptical stance,
they must redefine the subject matter of archeology. Whereas Binford (1962) changed the subject
by redefining cultures as adaptive systems, and the
behaviorists redefined it anew by (allegedly) sidestepping culture altogether, O'Brien and Holland
redefine adaptations as sets of artifacts. Thus, in
their selectionist world, human beings are something apart from adaptations, occupying a black
box in which their unreconstructable thoughts and
behavior are responsible for the creation of adaptations. Ironically, then, the O'Brien/Holland approach is more Skinnerian than behavioral
archeology in its original or contemporary forms.
As Wylie notes, Skinnerian behaviorism rejected
talk about intentional states on methodological
grounds related to what could be directly observed
rather than on a rejection of the existence of intentional states. Similarly, in the O'Brien/Holland approach, we avoid both behavior and intentionality
because they are too remote from observation. Since
the only thing we can talk about with a very high
level of security is artifacts, they restrict the scope
of archeology accordingly.
This is not a book for the methodologically
innocent or indifferent reader. Nor is this a good
introduction to behavioral archeology because it
assumes the reader does not need a program to tell
who the essentialists, reconstructionists, and
selectionists are. That said, there is good reading
here nevertheless. Schiffer' s discussion of the electric car is good history even if it is bad behaviorism. Walker's discussion of the life history of sacred
objects is (to me) fascinating. The ceramic chapters
contain useful analytical insights. The notes to
McGuire's engaging chapter contain an important,
if condensed, sociology of post-mentalist/prepostprocessual archeology. Finally, Wylie once
again shows her special talent as a summary commentator who has much to teach us.

Press, Tucson, 1996. viii + 202 pp.

Reviewed by Velicia R. Hubbard

As tourists, many of us have visited the place
called Grand Canyon, and those of us who have
surely considered the realms of the natural wonders
of the world. B. J. Moorehouse has done her research well, and it is evident that she has had a
long-standing interest in natural resource management. She combines in A Place Called Grand Canyon a lively interest in politics, culture, and
environmental science with a curiosity about the
evolution of America's highly distinctive landscapes. She discusses how the lands and resources
of the Grand Canyon have come to be divided in
many ways and for many different reasons, from
the time of Native Americans, to Western expansion, to the present-day. Her story exposes how
dynamic the geographical boundaries of the region
really are, regardless of the indelibility of the ink
that traces them on maps.
The author reminds the readers to consider the
past boundaries of the park and how it involves five
Indian reservations, and is also managed by three
Federal agencies and by the states of Utah and
Arizona. This has truly produced a "geographic
mosaic," and a bureaucratic nightmare. Moorehouse
then wants us to grasp three geographical concepts
(derived from Michael Foucault) that form the
framework of study. The first two are absolute space
(and its boundaries) and relative space. Absolute
space functions as a container, an area within which
certain ideas and behaviors dominate. An area that
supports multiple definitions-used either simultaneously or at different times-is termed relative
space. Representational space is the third concept,
and was defined to represent symbols, values, experiences, histories, and traditions (that can be intangible and unquantifiable) that give someone or
some group a sense of attachment to that location
or "place." Plainly, the frontier is closed, and the
human race needs to learn how to share the spaces
that we have created, and also how to make decisions as well as manage resources so that the maximum number of future options remain open.

In a nutshell, the Grand Canyon is in Arizona
and Utah, and is 277 miles long, 10 miles wide, and
4,000 feet deep. It takes in five of the seven life
zones and three of the four American deserts. The
Hopi Indians have lived there for thousands of years.
By the 1820s, American trappers began working the area, but it was the Mormons who were the
first Anglo-Americans to settle at the Grand Canyon. They did so without knowing that the Hopi,
Havasupai, Haulapai, and Paiute peoples considered it home. In 1861, Lt. Joseph Christmas Ives
led an expedition to the Colorado River, and published a report where he states that he saw no value
in the landscape! Other early explorers such as John
Wesley Powell, along with cartographer Francois
Emile Matthes, and painters and photographers visited the Grand Canyon and brought their visual
images to the world. With the creation by the United
States of Indian reservations in the area, much of
the Grand Canyon (including important religious
sites) was excluded; for the indigenous people, the
places of subsistence at the Grand Canyon became
places of resistance. For newcomers, the spaces of
the unknown would reaffirm the American dream.
Federal ownership of the Grand Canyon took
hold in 1908 when it was declared a National Monument, and in 1919 it became part of the National
Park system. With federal ownership came tourism, and the hope that government control over the
natural resources would eliminate impacts and
abuses to the land caused by logging, mining, and
livestock grazing. The indigenous people's place in
the landscape was all but overlooked, even though
the Havasupai were allowed use of the park lands
for traditional purposes. After many arguments and
lawsuits, the Havasupais were able to gain 2540
acres for their reservation and control of a critical
portion of the waters of Cataract (Havasu) creek,
but this did nothing to help the tribe's self sufficiency. They were forced to accept $1.2 million for
2,257, 728 acres instead of receiving more lands for
their people.

A Place Called Grand Canyon should be of
interest to readers concerned with the history of
land management in the U.S. West, to historians
new to the area, and to those who hope that the
future of the Grand Canyon as an ecological refuge
can be sustained under renewed and vigilant federal stewardship. A statement made by President

609

Theodore Roosevelt in 1908 when he declared the
park a National Monument is as relevant now as it
was then: "[the Grand Canyon} .. .is an object of
unusual scientific interest, being the greatest eroded
canyon in the U.S., and it appears that the public
interest would be promoted by reserving it as a
National Monument."

Projectile Technology, edited by Heidi Knecht, 1997. Plenum Press, New York. xvii+ 408 pp.

Reviewed by Steve A. Tomka

This volume is the product of a symposium
held at the 59th Annual Meeting of the Society for
American Archaeology in Anaheim, California, on
April 20-24, 1994. The goal of the symposium was
to bring together different methodological approaches and interpretive frameworks currently used
for exploring projectile technologies. The 15 papers in the volume cover a long temporal span,
extending from the Middle Paleolithic to the ethnographic present, discuss examples from five continents, and include experimental, ethnoarcheological,
and archeological examples.
The book is divided into five parts. Part I
consists of two papers that provide a comprehensive review of the history of research on projectile
technologies and of the available literature on the
use of projectiles in ethnographic and ethnohistoric
records. Chapter 1, written by H. Knecht, is an
extremely useful review and compilation of previous research on projectile technology. The presentation summarizes archeological, experimental, and
ethnoarcheological research concerned with understanding variability in projectile weapons and
the projectile tips themselves. The exhaustive list
of references will be of great use to any archeologist interested in further pursuing the topic. Chapter 2 (C. J. Ellis) discusses the factors that influence
the use of stone projectile tips as reflected in the
ethnographic and ethnohistoric record. Although
Ellis' data base is severely biased in favor of North
American examples, some South American and
Australian examples are also included. The author
addresses such useful topics as the relative effectiveness of stone points; conditions under which
points are used as knives; the use of poisons on
tips; and the conditions under which thrusting and
throwing spears would be employed. While the
conclusions of the paper will not surprise most
archeologists, it is interesting to note the number
of instances of both spears and the bow and arrow
being used among ethnographic groups. These examples, and others gleaned from the Texas
ethnohistorical literature, fuel the likelihood that

arrow and some dart point types were contemporaneous. This probability challenges traditional notions of site integrity that tend to be based largely
on projectile point type homogeneity.
Part II' s four papers deal with understanding
the implications of variability in the technical,
functional, and design elements of archeological
projectile point collections. Chapter 3 (by J. J.
Shea) builds a strong argument for the appearance
of stone-tipped spears during the Middle Paleolithic (ca. 80,000-100,000 B.P.) in Africa and
southwest Asia. The contribution is significant in
that while the presence of complex hunting equipment is generally accepted for the early Upper
Paleolithic (ca. 25,000-35,000 B.P.), its origins
have not been securely traced to the Middle Paleolithic. The paper is a good example of the methodological challenges of identifying projectile
point use on very expediently manufactured
Levallois points. In addition to methodological
contributions, Shea also provides an interpretive
framework for the conditions under which Middle
Paleolithic hominid groups would have found it
advantageous to shift from wooden spears to stonetipped weapons (e.g., increased reliability).
Chapter 4, by B. Finlayson and S. Mithen,
provides an example of the utility of micro-wear
analysis to identify tool function and, more
importantly, to contribute to the definition of site
function. Their analysis focuses on microliths from
the site of Gleann Mor on Islay, an island off the
west coast of Scotland. Traditional perspectives of
microliths have assumed that they are components
of projectile points. Therefore, sites with large
proportions of microliths were assumed to be
hunting camps. Through systematic use-wear
analysis, the authors are able to demonstrate that
wear diagnostic of projectile use is present on only
a small fraction of the microliths. Variation in the
use of microliths occurs not only between
morphological types but also within them, indicating
a more complex use history than traditionally
assumed. The redefinition of microliths as

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 70 (1999)

Reviews
components of generalized tools suggests a
reconsideration of the idea that sites with numerous
microliths are hunting camps. The common
practice of categorizing tools into functional
groups based on form, the multi-functional nature
of some point types, and the possibility that some
triangular points may have functioned primarily
as knives highlights the importance and utility of
employing similar use-wear based research
strategies in Texas archeology.
Chapter 5 (by A. Christenson) discusses the
potential functional meaning of unnotched and sidenotched triangular arrow points in North America.
The discussion goes beyond the traditional typological issues (e.g., point styles made by different
groups) to suggest that arrows tipped with these
points would have distinct killing powers. However, following an exhaustive analysis of 89 stonetipped arrows collected by J. W. Powell between
the late 1860s and 1870s, Christenson is forced to
conclude with some frustration that no clear-cut
explanation accounts for the formal variability in
point types noted in the sample. For those readers
that expect a show down between functional and
stylistic perspectives, the paper does not deliver
because the author a priori dismisses the latter explanation and focuses on searching for the explanation in the functional realm. Nonetheless, the
perspective employed is one that can infuse new
research directions and interpretive outlooks to
many projectile point typologies.
In Chapter 6, C. Bergman and E. McEwan
provide a detailed discussion of Asian composite
bow design. In addition to focusing on the Asian
designs, however, they also provide a useful discussion of the changes in bow designs through
time and the technological advantages of different
designs. This discussion, together with their consideration of the factors that led to the development of sinew-reinforced bows in North America,
are two of the more interesting parts of the paper.
Hard core bowers also will find the discussion of
bow construction details and design features extremely helpful.
Part III contains four chapters that rely on experimentation to aid the interpretation of variability
in prehistoric projectile technologies. The chapter
by J-M. Geneste and S. Maury (Chapter 7) is a
study in the design and implementation of an experimental research program for the study of a specific research issue: the process of production and

611

use of Solutrean projectile points from Western
Europe. The extensive comparative collections developed as part of the experimental studies of point
manufacture, use, and maintenance are invaluable
additions to present and future archeological research. They conclude that documentation of experimentation efforts provide archeological
references relevant to each stage of archeological
reasoning, which should motivate other archeologists to undertake similar systematic experimental
research programs.
H. Knecht's second contribution (Chapter 8)
explores the influence of raw materials on the
design, manufacture, performance, durability, and
maintainability of projectile points made of bone,
antler, and stone. The results indicate that stone
points can be made more quickly than points of
bone or antler. While the latter two materials make
more durable points, stone points are more lethal
due to their sharp edges. Due to the location and
nature of the breaks, however, bone and antler
points are more maintainable than stone points.
Antler points are more durable than bone point.
These conclusions provide a strong foundation for
constructing testable hypotheses regarding various strategies of technological organization among
hunter-gatherers in general, and Native American
inhabitants of North American specifically.
In Chapter 9, P. Cattelain discusses whether
Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic hunter-gatherers
of Europe used bows or spear throwers. The research question is not unlike the distinction
Americanist archeologists have faced in attempting
to distinguish between dart points and arrow points.
The research method is also similar in that Cattelain
chooses to study a world-wide sample of projectile
weapons from European museums and private collections. One of the useful contributions of the paper is the review of the spatio-temporal distribution
of the different weapon systems, and their comparison in terms of performance (throwing distance and
accuracy). Contrary to some recent perspectives,
Cattelain concludes that hunting strategy is not dependent on the weapon employed. Environmental
factors, prey choice, and the purpose of the hunt
seem to affect weapon choice. The sobering conclusion from his analysis is that simple morphological and metric criteria cannot be employed with
certainty for de facto classification of most Paleolithic projectile tips as dart or arrow points. Since
the point is only one component of the composite

612

Texas Archeological Society

system, many point designs can be employed, as
long as the projectile is kept in balance.
In the last chapter of this section, J. Pokines
and M. Krupa (Chapter 10) diverge from traditional typological discussions of self-barbed antler points, and explore the possible function of
these points during the Solutrean and Lower
Magdalenian in Cantabria, in northern Spain. The
authors employ a multi-dimensional research strategy integrating the reconstruction of regional
salmon resources, the archeological distribution
of self-barbed points in late Upper Paleolithic
sites, ethnohistoric examples of barb point use,
and replication experiments.
Part IV consists of four chapters that exemplify the utility of ethnoarcheological perspectives
in the study of projectile technologies. In Chapter
11, P. B Griffin discusses variation in arrow design among three groups of Agta of northeastern
Luzon, in the Philippines. Agta bow hunting focuses on wild pigs, deer, monkeys, and a number
of smaller game. Both single and multi-component arrows are used. Some differences do exist in
the stylistic attributes (e.g., form) of points manufactured by the three groups. Griffin focuses on
explaining formal variability in general rather than
inter-group variation in point designs. The study
indicates that a broad range of factors condition
arrow choice, including prey species, prey size,
the condition of the animal, forest context, season,
weather conditions, and the availability of personnel, dogs, and arrows. Overall, it appears that the
probability of a successful kill is one of the main
factors conditioning arrow choice. These factors
suggests that arrow manufacture costs are relatively high and game densities are high enough to
allow hunters this low risk behavior.
Chapter 12, written by R. D. Greaves, examines the multi-functional use of bows and arrows
within the technological organization of Pume
hunters of Venezuela. While Pume bows and arrows are designed to be able to capture the largest
prey package available, most of the time their use
exhibits a great degree of situational flexibility
ranging from digging sticks, to cutting tools,
spears, and clubs. Bows and arrows were used for
a greater range of tasks as the length of the hunting trips increased. This pattern may have been
influenced by the number of tools that could be
carried under conditions of high mobility. Interestingly, at the same time, the use of knives and

machetes tended to become increasingly more
narrow. Overall, the study demonstrates that the
use of multi-functional and/or specialized tool kits
is conditioned by mobility patterns and resource
acquisition strategies, and this is not apparent in
differences in their formal characteristics. This
conclusion should concern archeologists seeking
to differentiate specialized and generalized tools
and tool kits based on formal attributes.
L. Bertram (Chapter 13) compares the hunting
strategies and weapons employed by the Kua of
the eastern Kalahari and the Hadza of Tanzania.
Both groups use bows and arrows as the preferred
poison delivery systems. Nonetheless, there are
significant differences in the size of the weapon
systems and their killing power. Bertram concludes
that the type and structure of the vegetation present
in the two regions conditions the hunting strategies
employed, and that these strategies in turn affect
the design of the weapon systems utilized.
Chapter 14, by R. Hitchcock and P. Bleed, is a
discussion of spear and arrow use among San hunters of the Kalahari. They summarize the conditions
under which the two weapon systems are employed
and the advantages and disadvantages of each system and hunting strategy, while noting that hunting
with simple projectile systems is characterized by
high failure rates. Often, the difference between
success and failure depends on the individual's
stalking skills rather than his weaponry. It is true,
however, that once game is encountered, spears
and bows and arrows have different potentials for
bringing down the prey and recovering it successfully. Significantly, Hitchcock and Bleed observe
that the choice as to which weapon system to use is
conditioned by the hunter's knowledge, experience,
and the estimated benefits compared against the
costs of using each system.
Part V, the last section of the volume, consists of a summary paper by M. Nelson. She
provides an overview of the volume's significant
contributions and emphasizes the utility of design theory in understanding aspects of technological organization.
Overall, Projectile Technology is a significant
contribution to middle-range theory building. With
its thematic focus, regional breadth, and wealth of
perspectives, it should be considered necessary
reading by archeologists interested in interpreting
the meaning of the seemingly endless variability
in weapons technology and projectile point

forms present in the archeological record. While
many of the papers emphasize that the real world
is more complex than our theoretical concepts,

613

the multitude of perspectives should serve to
provoke new directions in projectile point
research in Texas.

The Karankawa Indians of Texas: An Ecological Study of Cultural Tradition and Change, by Robert A.
Ricklis. University of Texas Press, Austin, 1996. xii + 222 pages.

Reviewed by John E. Dockall

The Karankawa Indians of Texas is organized
to provide an introductory overview of Karankawa
prehistory and adaptation, and concludes with convincing interpretations of their strategies for adapting to increasing European colonial influence.
Chapter 1 summarizes the lifeways, geographic limits, and the various groups included under the rubric of "Karankawa." This discussion amply sets
the stage for the remainder of the book.
Chapter 2 is devoted to an in-depth characterization of the central part of the Texas Gulf Coast.
Ricklis' discussion of the environment is resourceoriented rather than merely providing an environmental profile. Marine and terrestrial faunal and
floral resources are presented within spatial and
temporal limitations, along with what these limits
may have meant for Karankawa subsistence and
settlement.
A brief synopsis and history of Rockport phase
archeology and material culture is provided in Chapter 3. The distinctiveness of the Rockport assemblage lies in the ceramics: Rockport Plain, Rockport
Incised, Rockport Black-on-gray, and Rockport
Crenelated. The spatial distribution of these ceramic types has been used to define the limits of the
Karankawa homeland. Associated seasonal indicators, including fish otoliths, and shellfish, were effectively used (see Chapters 4 and 5) to define
Karankawa setlement and subsistence.
The heart of Ricklis' book is Chapters 4 and 5,
in which the archeology, material culture, and seasonality evidence are brought to bear on understandings of Karankawa lifeways. Ricklis provides
data and interpretation for the use and exploitation
of coastal marine and inland resources. The principal lines of evidence include site size, thickness of
the cultural deposits, faunal remains, and artifact
variability. The variability resulted in the identification of Group 1 (shoreline) and Group 2 (inland
prairie margin) sites of the Rockport phase. Seasonality data indicates that shoreline sites were primarily occupied during the fall and winter where
fish and shellfish were exploited. Prairie margin

sites were less intensively utilized, mainly during
the spring-summer exploitation of inland mediumlarge mammal resources.
The patterning and assemblage differences between Group 1 and Group 2 sites are robust and
enabled the author to place them within a framework of Karankawa adaptation. Chapter 6 outlines
and details the patterns of seasonal exploitation
along the central coast of Texas. One of the most
important aspects of the Karankawa adaptive strategy defined by Ricklis was the balance achieved
between resource exploitation and economic risk.
These factors were incorporated into the Karankawa
lifeway through a series of seasonal settlement shifts
and population fluctuations in accord with resource
availability. Significant also is the chronological
indication that this type of adaptive system was in
place from the Archaic to the Early Historic period.
Inherent flexibility of the system later enabled the
Karankawa to remain culturally and adaptively resilient to Spanish territorial incursions.
Chapter 7 documents the dynamic nature of
changing Karankawa adaptive strategies during the
Spanish Colonial period. Ricklis compares the archeological data to 17th and 18th century Spanish
and French ethnohistoric observations. The result
of Ricklis' comparative study is the clear definition
of the continuance of a bilobed settlement system
in operation prior to European contact.
The influence of increasing European contact
and settlement are discussed in detail in Chapter 8.
Even with the increasing presence of European interlopers, the Karankawa lifeway apparently
changed little during the 18th century. The author
is thorough in including 18th century observations
of disease among the Karankawa and the subsequent population decline from 1685 to 1850.
The establishment of a series of Spanish
missions along the central coastal area presented
the Karankawa with both problems and possibilities.
Chapter 9 addresses the growing conflict between
the Karankawa and the Spanish. Historic records
indicate that confrontation and conflict characterized

Reviews
the initial establishment of missions in the region.
But beginning in the last decade of the 18th century,
there was a change in the nature of the relationship
between the Spanish missions and the Karankawa.
By the late 1700s, the perceptions of the
Karankawa about the Spanish missions had become
one of practicality, and the missions became an
integral part of Karanakawa subsistence/settlement
strategies. This tenuous but significant relationship
is explored in Chapter 10 via detailed inquiries and
discussion of historic observations by Spanish
chroniclers. Further support for this inference is
taken from documented accounts of the arrival and
departure of various Native groups at the missions
of Espiritu Santo, Rosario, and Refugio.
Ricklis also provides in Chapter 10 a succinct
synthesis of changes within the Karankawa adaptive system from prehistory, to the decades of
Spanish missions, and into the 19th century. At
the culmination of Spanish and later Anglo-American influences it is perhaps most significant that,
despite the introduction of such new variables,
traditional Karankawa identities and perceptions
of themselves were essentially intact. Ricklis' volume has demonstrated that in some cases, Native
reactions to foreign cultural intervention and impacts can be ameliorated by Native groups. The
key to Karankawa stability was the recognized
necessity for cultural interaction-in this case the
presence of Spanish missions as key links in the

615

traditional settlement/subsistence system-and the
successful integration of these new elements into
the traditional cultural system.
Additionally, Ricklis provides information in
Appendix A that details the geographic and chronological characteristics of Rockport phase ceramics. The use of Rockport phase ceramics as symbols
of cultural boundaries is explored via attributes of
surface treatment with asphalt and the abundance
of bone temper, as well as the variability of these
traits at Late Prehistoric sites along the Texas Gulf
Coastal Plain. Appendix B elaborates on the methodology and techniques employed by Ricklis to
establish seasonality based on fish otoliths, Rangia
cuneata, and Crassostrea virginica.
This book can easily be considered a turning
point in our attitudes and understandings of Native Americans in Texas. Ricklis has provided a
lucid and rational treatment of the archeological
and ethnohistoric data pertaining to the
Karankawa. The result of this blending of data
sources is a coherent picture of Karankawa prehistory, lifeways, adaptations, and the consequences of European contact. The Karankawa
Indians of Texas will be a welcome addition to the
libraries of all Texas archeologists, both professional and avocational. It is a very straight-forward and well-researched presentation of historic
documents, chronicled observations, and solid archeological field work.
