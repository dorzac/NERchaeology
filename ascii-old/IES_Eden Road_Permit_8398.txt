ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES)
for the Eden Road Realignment Project in the City of Arlington, Tarrant County, Texas.
As the City of Arlington is a political entity of the State of Texas, it is required to comply
with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, as the project will require a
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) Nationwide Permit (NWP) from the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), portions of the project are subject to the provisions
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. All work
conformed to 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800, and 13 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations for implementing Section
106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. The goal of the survey was to locate,
identify, and assess any cultural resources, which include standing historic-age
buildings/structures and archeological sites that could be adversely affected by the
proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for their potential eligibility for
listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources survey was conducted by Project Archeologist Thomas Chapman
and Staff Archeologist Alexandra Younger on 08 May 2018 under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 8398. The Area of Potential Effects (APE), located at the intersection of
Eden Road and Curry Road, encompasses approximately 24.7 acres. During the IES
survey, no archeological sites were documented within the APE. No further work is
warranted. However, if any cultural resources, other than those documented within this
report, are encountered during construction, the operators should stop construction
activities and immediately contact the project environmental representative to initiate
coordination with the USACE and THC prior to resuming any construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report presents the results of a cultural resources inventory survey conducted by Integrated
Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES), under subcontract to Wier and Associates, Inc., (Wier) for the
proposed Eden Road Realignment Project in the City of Arlington, Tarrant County, Texas. A brief
description of the proposed project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE), environmental and historical
contexts, field and analytical methods, results of the investigations, and recommendations are provided in
this document. Prepared in accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002) guidelines,
this report satisfies the cultural resources requirements of the proposed project.

1.1 Introduction
As the cultural resources consultant to Wier, on behalf of the City of Arlington, IES performed an
intensive cultural resources survey for the Eden Road Realignment Project. As the City of Arlington is a
political subdivision of the State of Texas, it is required to comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT). In addition, the project will require a Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) Nationwide
Permit (NWP) from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The purpose of these investigations
was to conduct an inventory of cultural resources (as defined by Code of Federal Regulations, Title 36,
Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed project area and to evaluate identified
resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per
Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
Therefore, all work conformed to 36 CFR 800, and 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which
outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. The
cultural resources survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8398.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
1.2.1 Direct APE
The APE encompasses an approximately 24.7-acre (ac) area and extends approximately 1.3 mile (mi)
along Eden Road and Curry Road from U.S. Highway (US) 287 to the intersection of Curry Road and
Westfield Court (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). Engineering designs call for the realignment and widening of
Eden Road and Curry Road. Through the undertaking, the current 20-foot-wide roadways will be
widened and realigned into a single 38-foot-wide road with paralleling pedestrian pathways. The
southern pedestrian pathway will consist of a 5-foot-wide concrete walkway that will be offset 6 feet (ft)
from the proposed road. The northern pedestrian pathway will be a 12-foot-wide concrete pedestrian and
cycling trail that will parallel the road approximately 6 ft to the north. The most significant improvement
will occur at the east end of Eden Road where it intersects with Curry Road. The new proposed roadway
will be realigned approximately 215 ft north to create a direct connection to Curry Road. The new
intersection of Eden Road and Curry Road will feature one of three proposed traffic circles; the other
traffic circles will be located along Curry Road at Ledbetter Road and Calendar Road.
The proposed project will require grading and drainage improvements throughout the APE, as well as the
replacement of three reinforced-concrete box culverts. The western culvert will be located approximately
285 ft east of the US 287 frontage road. The two eastern culverts will be west of the intersection of Curry
Road and Ridge Estates Court and will connect to a channelized section of an unnamed tributary of
Sublett Creek. Storm drains and concrete block rip-rap will be installed adjacent to each culvert. A
proposed storm sewer near the westernmost traffic circle will empty into a rip-rap-lined channel that will
drain into the adjacent Sublett Creek. A retaining wall will be constructed in an east-to-west orientation
between the culvert locations and will, at maximum, reach 10 ft above ground surface. The retaining wall
will support the pedestrian and cycling trail at a higher elevation above the grade of Eden Road.

Vertical impacts within the APE will primarily be restricted to the ground surface; however, deeper
subsurface disturbances will occur in association with the installation of rip-rap and the retaining wall,
which will reach approximately 3 to 4 ft below surface.
1.2.2 Indirect APE
As the project will require federal permitting from the USACE, an assessment of the indirect effects will
be required within USACE jurisdiction to satisfy Section 106 of the NHPA requirements. Final designs
of the project indicate that above-ground elements will be typical for multi-lane roadway. To account for
these above-ground elements, a 100-foot-wide indirect effects APE was assessed surrounding the direct
effects APE within USACE jurisdictional areas.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
2.1.1 Climate
Tarrant County is located within North-Central Texas. This region features a humid subtropical climate
with an annual rainfall average ranging from approximately 35 to 40 inches (in). Most precipitation
occurs as rain between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year.
This subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year-round temperature with occasional
exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).
2.1.2 Topographic Setting
The Kennedale 7.5-minute USGS topographic quadrangle map illustrates the APE located in a gently
sloping upland setting that is comprised of low hills dissected by Sublett Creek and an unnamed tributary
of Sublett Creek (see Figure 1.2). The headwaters of Sublett Creek are located 1.83 mi southeast of the
APE and flow in a general southwest-to-northeast direction across the northwestern corner of the APE.
The unnamed tributary of Sublett Creek begins approximately 0.08 mi south of the APE and flows across
the APE near the intersection of Curry Road and a private road west of Winthrop Drive. The confluence
of Sublett Creek and the unnamed tributary of Sublett Creek occurs approximately 0.35 mi north of the
APE and eventually converge with Rush Creek to the east.
2.1.3 Geology and Soils
The APE lies within the Eastern Cross Timbers ecoregion. The Eastern Cross Timbers region was
historically characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills that are orientated along a north-tosouth axis from Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring 1994; McGowen et al. 1987). This
region contains numerous hills that were once heavily wooded with oak, walnut, blackjack, and hickory
growing within the deep, sandy soils (Hill 1901). Early pioneers referred to the region as the Monte
Grande (Grand Forest) and later the Lower Timbers. However, due to urban expansion, agricultural
development, and other modern activities, the natural vegetation has become highly fragmented, and only
a few large tracts of undisturbed woodlands remain today (TPWD 2018).
The APE is underlain by the Cretaceous-age Woodbine (Kwb) geological formation (Figure 2.1). The
Woodbine Formation is primarily sandstone and contains a small percentage of siltstone, mudstone, and
clay (McGowen et al. 1987; USGS 2018). Weathering of the Woodbine Formation has resulted in the
formation of soils with a sandy epipedon within the Cross Timbers ecoregion.
As illustrated by the Soil Survey of Tarrant County, Texas, there are six mapped soil units within the APE
(Ressel 1981; Table 2.1; Figure 2.2). Approximately 87.9 percent of the APE contains soils typical of
upland settings within the Eastern Cross Timbers. The remaining 12.1 percent of the soils within the APE
pertains to the frequently flooded soils along Sublett Creek. Soil data was viewed from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey
(Web Soil Survey 2018).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and the Texas Historic Sites Atlas
(THSA) maintained by the THC indicated there are no previously recorded archeological sites, National
Register properties, historical markers, or cemeteries within the APE (TASA 2018, THSA 2018). The
TASA database identified three previously conducted archeological surveys and three previously
recorded archeological sites located within 1 mi (~1.6 kilometers [km]) of the APE (TASA 2018; Tables
3.1 and 3.2; Figure 3.1).

3.2 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the general
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Tarrant County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Dallas Sheet), USGS topographic maps, the NRCS
digital soil database for Tarrant County, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Potential
Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for Tarrant County, the National Archives and Records
Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Tarrant County, the Texas
Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and both past and current aerial photography.
3.2.1 Disturbance Analysis
During the background review, it was determined that ground-disturbing activities have transpired within
the APE related to past land use and suburban development. Historical aerial photographs indicate that
the properties within and adjacent to the APE were used primarily for agricultural or ranching purposes as
early as 1953, and presumably during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as well. Although mostly
cleared of vegetation, the western portion of the APE contained small areas of riparian forest along the
banks of each tributary. Trees and shrubs were removed from these areas in the 1950s and 1960s, but the
areas were subsequently left unmaintained and eventually revegetated in secondary growth.

Land use within the APE changed in the 1990s when residential and commercial developments were built
north and south of the APE. In 1990, a pipeline was installed through the APE near the intersection of
Eden Road and Curry Road. In the early 1990s, the westernmost tributary was channelized, and many
trees and dense understory had been removed south of Eden Road. Between 2001 and 2005, a 30-indiameter water pipeline was installed north of Eden Road from US 287 to Curry Road. Sublett Creek
Linear Park was constructed in 2011 north of the intersection of Eden Road and Curry Road. The
southern limits of the park lie within the APE. The eastern portion of the APE, along Curry Road, has
been heavily modified as a result of the development of several residential subdivisions. On each side of
Curry Road, approximately 40 to 60 ft of cleared right-of-way (ROW) containing stormwater drainage
channels and electric transmission lines border the road with the exception a few properties that limit the
ROW width to approximately 10 ft.
3.2.2 Prehistoric Resource Potential
The TxDOT PALM for Tarrant County indicates a portion of the APE, extending approximately 0.5 mi
from US 287 to Ridge Estates Court, features a moderate to high potential for containing shallow and
deeply-buried cultural materials within a reasonable context. The remainder of the APE features a low to
negligible potential for containing shallow and deeply-buried cultural deposits. However, grounddisturbing activities have disturbed the majority of the western portion of the APE and subsequently
lowered the potential for encountering intact cultural deposits. Despite past disturbances, a few isolated
areas of moderate to high potential remain within the undisturbed riparian corridor located along Sublett
Creek and the unnamed tributary of Sublett Creek.
Due to variable likelihood for encountering cultural resources within the APE, this survey consisted of
project-specific investigations to target high probability areas (HPA) within the APE. To develop HPA
for prehistoric archeological sites, areas containing moderate and high potential identified within the
TxDOT PALM were selected within the APE. To define the historic-period HPA, structure locations
identified within georeferenced historical maps and aerial photographs were buffered to include a 1-ac
area surrounding each identified historic-age structural feature. Final HPA limits were determined by
combining the historic and prehistoric HPA and comparing the initial probability data to current land use,
locations of previous disturbances, and prior archeological survey limits. For example, areas identified as
high potential within the TxDOT PALM, but located within previously disturbed or developed settings,
were not considered within the final HPA limits. The 4.3-ac HPA identified for this survey is represented
in Figure 3.2. The HPA boundary does not denote the specific limits of intensive survey but was
expanded and contracted depending on field observations during the survey. Areas outside designated
HPA or otherwise displaying high levels of previous ground disturbance were inspected by pedestrian
survey and review of aerial photography.
3.2.3 Historic-Period Resource Potential
Historic-period resources within North-Central Texas are primarily related to farmsteads, houses, and
associated outbuildings and structures that date from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Typically,
these types of resources are located along old roadways, but can be located along railroads, creeks, and
open pastures. Although determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings and structures is
problematic, thorough and accurate maps depicting these features were widely available post-1895.
Historical maps indicate the project area was void of historic-period resources as early as 1893.
According to historical maps, Eden Road and Curry Road were constructed between 1894 and 1920 and
have maintained the same general alignment to the present. Although historical aerial photographs and
topographic maps illustrate no buildings or structures directly within the APE, historical maps depict
several structures located adjacent to the APE. However, the former locations of these historic-period
structures have been disturbed by modern construction and development. As such, there is a low potential
for encountering historic-period cultural resources within the APE.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The methods utilized during this survey meet the minimum archeological survey standards requirements
for field investigations recommended by the CTA (CTA 1996, 2001) and approved by the THC. Prior to
field work, the IES staff conducted historical and archeological records reviews to determine previously
recorded resources within the APE and within a 1-mi (1.6-km) radius of the APE (see Section 3.1).
Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, and soils data, as well as historical and modern
topographic maps and aerial photography of the APE. The archeological inventory survey for the Eden
Road Realignment Project was conducted on 14 May 2018.

4.1 Field Methods
The 100-percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The pedestrian survey
consisted of a multiple transect scheme that spanned previously undisturbed portions of the APE, with a
focus on areas determined during the background review to contain a high probability for the occurrence
of cultural resources. Areas within the APE that displayed high levels of disturbance were photographed
to document the lack of potential for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods
included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.
4.1.1 Shovel Testing
In areas with potential for the preservation of buried archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated
to depths of 80 centimeters (cm) or to the extent of Holocene soil deposits, whichever was encountered
first. Each shovel test was 30 cm in diameter and was hand excavated in natural stratigraphic levels not
exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using 0.25-in hardware mesh to facilitate the
recovery of buried cultural material. If the clay content was high and could not be efficiently screened,
material was troweled through by hand and inspected for cultural materials. In addition, the physical
properties of each soil stratum were recorded. All shovel test locations and other survey data were
recorded and plotted using a Trimble GeoXT handheld global positioning system (GPS) receiver. Based
on CTA survey standards, an APE of 1.3 mi in length would require the excavation of 20 shovel tests (16
shovel tests excavated per mile) during the pedestrian survey. However, the number of shovel tests
excavated during this survey varied from the standard amount due to the presence of an unnamed
tributary channel, steep channel banks, erosional features, existing park infrastructure, and previous
disturbances from residential development and buried utility infrastructure.

4.2 Curation
Records, files, field notes, forms, and other documentation are included in the curation package. All
field-generated documents are temporarily curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL.
These documents and photographs were organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During this survey, the direct APE was subjected to reconnaissance survey transects and a systematic
intensive survey. Pedestrian reconnaissance was conducted across portions of the APE to confirm the
extent of prior ground disturbances and assess the likelihood of encountering cultural resources. Ground
surface visibility was highly variable and irregular across the APE, ranging from 30 to 100 percent.
Intensive survey with systematic shovel test sampling in staggered intervals was conducted across
portions of the APE with the potential to contain archeological resources. During this survey, no cultural
resources were encountered. A survey photograph location map and general APE photographs are
presented in Appendix A.

5.1 Archeological Survey
5.1.1 Survey Observations
During the background review conducted for this project, it appeared that the portions of the APE west of
Ridge Estates Court had avoided significant previous ground-disturbing activities, and these portions of
the APE had retained a reasonable context. The majority of the overall APE occupies the existing ROW
of Eden and Curry roads (Appendix A, Photographs 1 through 20). The existing roadways are
paralleled by drainage ditches and well-maintained grass cover. Commercial and residential
developments line Curry Road. The western 0.5 mile of the APE expands beyond the existing ROW to
include open and wooded undeveloped land (Appendix A, Photographs 21 through 40). A sewer line
was constructed through this portion of the APE, and a trail system associated with the adjacent Sublett
Creek Linear Park was constructed adjacent to the northern boundary of the APE (Appendix A,
Photographs 32 through 37).
5.1.2 Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
The pedestrian survey was conducted with semi-systematic intensive shovel testing conducted in 50-m to
100-m (164-ft to 328-ft) intervals along previously undisturbed portions of the APE with a high
probability of containing cultural resources. Precise shovel test placement along the APE was largely
controlled by the presence of an unnamed tributary channel, steep channel banks, erosional features,
existing park infrastructure, buried utilities, and residential and commercial development. Shovel tests
were conducted along one general transect located north of Eden and Curry Road. During the survey, 16
shovel tests were excavated throughout the APE (Figure 5.1). No shovel tests were excavated within the
developed portion of the APE between Ridge Estates Court and Lionsgate Court due to previous surface
modifications and the presence of buried utilities.
Soils exposed in shovel tests across the APE generally consisted of a thick (typically 20 to 70 cm in
thickness) dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam (10YR 4/4) surface layer overlying brown (10YR 4/3)
fine sandy clay. Surface soils typically extended to depths of approximately 80 cm or less and mantled a
sandy clay subsoil. No artifacts or cultural deposits were encountered in any of the shovel tests excavated
within the APE.

5.2 Deeply Buried Archeological Site Assessment
Through field observations along the APE and a review of the existing archeological record in the
vicinity, it was determined that the APE possessed a negligible potential for preserving deeply buried
cultural deposits. No deeply buried prehistoric archeological sites have been previously documented
within the direct or indirect APE. The few prehistoric archeological sites documented within the vicinity
of the APE (e.g., 41TR12, 41TR14, and 41TR159) have been documented as relatively shallow sites in
uplands. This assessment was further validated through field observations, which noted no defined
floodplain along Sublett Creek or the unnamed tributary of Sublett Creek. As such, it was determined
that deep sampling via mechanical trenching was not required within the APE.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During this cultural resources survey, the entire 24.7-ac APE was systematically and intensively
investigated through pedestrian survey augmented by the excavation of 16 shovel tests within areas
containing the potential for archeological deposits.
No cultural resources were documented within the APE. It is the recommendation of IES that the THC
concur with our findings and that no additional investigations are warranted for the proposed expansion
and realignment of Eden and Curry roads within the APE. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, the operators should immediately cease construction activities in those
areas. The project cultural resources consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation
with the USACE and THC prior to resuming construction activities.
