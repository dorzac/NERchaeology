Abstract
The San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park is located in Harris County, about 20 miles (32 kilometers)
east of downtown Houston. The park is situated adjacent the San Jacinto River and about five miles (eight
kilometers) northwest of where the river empties into Galveston Bay. The park is comprised of a little over 1,100
acres (445 hectares) that have been accumulated over the years, beginning in 1883. Management of the park has
been in the hands of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department since 1965. The adoption of a new master plan and
anticipated park development underscored the need to better understand the parks history and cultural resources.
In early-2001, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department contracted The University of Texas at San Antonio, Center
for Archaeological Research, to undertake a review and synthesis of the sites history. The work involved an
archaeological resource evaluation of the park. In addition to developing a historical synthesis, this project was
also designed to utilize the available historical documents, as well as interviews, to assess the probability that
buried cultural resources are present throughout the park and to make recommendations as to the need for
additional archaeological work, particularly prior to ground-disturbing activities.

Introduction

Project Scope

In February of 2001, The University of Texas at San
Antonio, Center for Archaeological Research (UTSACAR), entered into a contract with the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department (TPWD) to provide a
historical and cultural resource synthesis of the San
Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park (Figure 1).
The study is to support the recent adoption of a new
park Master Plan and is intended to assess the
likelihood of buried prehistoric and historic cultural
resources within the park and consider the
management of all probable cultural resources within
the site. Since the work was limited to archival
research, a Texas Antiquities Permit was not required.

The organization and content of the report reflect on
the main goals of this study. The three main objectives
of this report, as stated in the scope of work, were:
1) Construct a comprehensive history of the
battle from the original sources, taking as
much care as possible to link the events of
the battle with actual battleground locations;
2) Identify what type of prehistoric sites are
likely to be present in the park, and the
locations (both vertically and horizontally)
where such resources might reasonably be
expected to occur and, conversely, where such
resources are not likely to occur;

The first portion of the report outlines the scope of
work and summarizes the historical parks geography,
flora, and fauna. Chapter 3 synthesizes the cultural
chronology of the Gulf Coastal Plains and focuses on
the types of prehistoric properties that may be expected
within the project area. The next chapter (Chapter 4)
details the previous investigations within the historical
park and its immediate vicinity to provide a summary
of what is known up to the present about the park and
its cultural resources. Chapter 5 provides a discussion
of the circumstances leading to the Battle of San
Jacinto, the actual battle, and its immediate aftermath.
Chapter 6 summarizes the post-battle regional history
and the founding of the State Historical Park to foretell
the types of historic properties that may be present
within the park. Chapter 7 outlines the development
goals as set forth in the Master Plan and the
anthropogenic and natural forces that may have
impacted the project area and the resulting difficulties
in locating where various events associated with the
battle took place. Chapter 8 summarizes specific
management strategies and archaeological methods
and techniques necessary to discover archaeological
properties in the historical park.

3) Identify what type of other historic resources
(i.e., historic resources not associated with the
Battle of San Jacinto) may be buried in the
park, and what areas within the park have the
potential to contain such resources.
To achieve these goals, project personnel reviewed
the various sources of archival information available
on the battle. A major emphasis of the archival research
was directed toward obtaining as much information
as possible regarding the events leading up to and
including the actual battle that occurred on April 21,
1836. The events that preceded the battle were
considered extremely important to ascertain the
physical configuration of the opposing forces upon
the parklands now owned by the state. Although a great
deal of material has been written, specific details are
limited. More than forty primary documents were
consulted, and both English and Spanish versions were
reviewed. In addition, over 160 secondary reports,
pamphlets, and documents were considered, but not
all were cited since these were found to be of varying

degrees of value. It was obvious, in the older material,
that extreme political factions within the new
government sharply divided the various participants
and colored or biased their reporting of events in both
source versions, requiring an amount of caution in
taking any source at face value. The differences in the
reporting by those involved, especially between Sam
Houston and Sidney Sherman, were evident well into
the 1870s.

within the park, and his first-hand knowledge of the
topography and history of the park, have been a great
and valuable aid in compiling this report.

Among the most useful repositories consulted were
the Daughters of the Republic of Texas Library at the
Alamo, the Center for American History and the PerryCastañeda Library in Austin, the John Peace Library
and Special Collections at The University of Texas at
San Antonio, the San Antonio Public Library, the
Houston Public Library, and the research files of the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in La Porte and
Austin. The map collection at the Center for American
History in Austin yielded two maps that contributed
pertinent information regarding the placement of
existing markers in the park. Contributions of maps
and published materials from Elizabeth Whitlow and
Jan DeVault, of the San Jacinto Chapter of the
Daughters of the Republic of Texas, were especially
useful in establishing the history of land use over the
past century. The files of the Harris County Deed
Records and the microfilms of the U.S. Census were
helpful in establishing the land ownership and personal
history of previous owners.
To address issues of post-battle disturbances to the
area and the nature of other historic sites within the
park, numerous published and unpublished sources
were consulted that relate to the history of the area.
Because the park is in a highly dynamic geomorphological context, a considerable amount of time was
spent assessing the impacts of anthropogenic and
natural forces upon the natural setting and the potential
cultural resources of the project area. Perhaps most
valuable in this research effort were assorted early
maps and aerial photography contributed by TPWD.
Finally, information received from the Coastal
Resource Coordinator, Mr. Ted Hollingsworth,
regarding the results of various previous investigations

Introduction

San Jacinto Bay, Trinity Bay, and Galveston Bay to
its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico.

San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park is
located in Harris County, 20 miles east of downtown
Houston. The park itself lies at the juncture of the south
bank of Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River and
is bordered on the north and east by the Houston Ship
Channel. Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River,
including those portions bordering the park, have been
dredged and widened between 1870 and the 1970s to
form the Houston Ship Channel (Figure 2). Buffalo
Bayou was recognized early as the most dependably
navigable waterway in Texas, and in 1836 the town of
Houston was established at its termination. Steamboats
first began arriving in Houston via the bayou in 1837.
Weniger (1984:122) reports that numerous nineteenthcentury descriptions of Buffalo Bayou exist, attesting
that Buffalo Bayou has become the waterway most
important in many respects to the State of Texas, and
one of the most famous in the world. The San Jacinto
River lies in territory historically contested between
the Spanish and the French during the early to mideighteenth century (Jackson 2001) and was the site of
the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836, in which Texan
forces under Sam Houston defeated Santa Annas army
and secured their independence from Mexico.

Climate in the region falls within the Upper Coast
Climatic Division, which encompasses both temperate
and tropical zones (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). Tropical
weather activity affects the upper coast in the form of
hurricanes, tropical storms, and other disturbances,
especially from late June through September. The
region receives an average of 46.19 inches (117 cm)
of precipitation annually, with an average yearly
temperature of 69.6 degrees Fahrenheit (21° C) (Carr
1967:Table 1). Precipitation is largely due to
convective shower and thunderstorm activity. Harris
County has a predominantly marine climate (Wheeler
1976). High humidity and proximity to the Gulf Coast
results in mild winters, relatively cool summer nights,
and abundant rainfall.
Grassland soils underlie the coastal prairies and are
generally dark colored, loamy, and clayey with high
water retention and inadequate drainage (Wheeler
1976). Historical accounts of travel through the coastal
plains provide a graphic illustration of the nature of
these soils. One traveler, in 1767, noted:
When it rains this plain becomes a lake, at times
impassable, the water reaching to a mans waist
and to the horses belly (Weniger 1984:24).

Environment
Harris County falls within the Coastal Prairies sub
province of Texas Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
region (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996; Carr
1967:Figure 3). The Coastal Prairies landscape is
characterized by level or nearly level grasslands, with
trees uncommon except along streams and in oak
mottes. From Corpus Christi to Brownsville, the
landscape is marked by low dunes and ponds formed
by blowouts. The San Jacinto River basin is the
principal drainage system in Harris County and
encompasses the Buffalo Bayou watershed (Texas
Water Commission 1962). It flows southeast from its
headwaters in Grimes and Walker counties through

In 1854, F. L. Olmstead, traveling from Victoria to
Port Lavaca, described:
A dead flat [that] extended as far as the eye could
reach, reeking with water The rain fell
constantly, and the clay-soil having been saturated
before, the whole now remained upon the surface,
so that we waded through water fetlock deep
As we approached the coast the ground became
still more perfectly level and more deeply
inundated. The horses were half-knee deep
(Weniger 1984:25).

Chapter 2: Environmental Setting

Within the park, soils belong to the Lake Charles
series: deep, nearly level clayey soils in upland prairie
settings that are poorly drained both internally, and in
terms of surface runoff. While most of the region can
be described as a nearly level plain dissected by
streams and rivers draining into the Gulf of Mexico,
much environmental diversity is exhibited along the
coastincluding the barrier islands, saltgrass marshes
around bays and estuaries, tall-grass prairies, oak
parklands and mottes, and tall woodlands in riverine
environments (Texas Parks and Wildlife 2001).

In 1855, another traveler described the deep, still
waters of the bayou and the dense vegetation growing
at its banks:
We left Galveston in the Houston steamer at four
oclock to go fifty miles up the bay and forty miles
up the bayou to Houston Our steamer, near two
hundred feet long, was navigated the whole way
through a channel hardly more than eighty feet
wide, though deep enough to float a man-of-war.
Negroes holding braziers of blazing pinewood,
stood on each side of the vessel, illuminating our
passage, the foliage and even the beautiful flowers
so near that we could almost gather them as we
floated by; a small bell was ringing every instant,
to direct our engineers; one moment the larboard
paddle, then the starboard, was stopped or set in
motion, or the wheels were altogether standing
still, while we swung round the narrow corners of
this tortuous channel; the silence of the bordering
forests broken alone by the sobs of our highpressure engine Human voices were awed into
silence during our solemn progress, which seemed
to me to belong neither to the sea nor the earth
A downward steamer once passed us: I was glad
we did not meet at one of the narrowest places,
for there, I believe, they sometimes edge by one
another, absolutely touching, but this navigation,
however extraordinary, is considered peculiarly
safe. The depth of the water being so great and so
still, it is difficult to understand how these bayous
have been formed (Weniger 1984:122123).

Flora and Fauna
Highly diverse landscapes, including tidal salt
marshes, salt meadows, freshwater wetlands, riparian
hardwood forests, and coastal prairies are encompassed within the San Jacinto Battleground State
Historical Parks boundaries (Texas Parks and Wildlife
n.d.). The environmental diversity of the Gulf Coast
region and the project area make it rich in natural
resources attractive to wildlife and humans alike.

Tidal Salt Marshes
Buffalo Bayou is tidal from its junction with Whiteoak
Bayou in Houston, eighteen miles above its mouth
(Handbook of Texas Online 2001). An anonymous
writer described the bayou in 1837 in the following
manner:
The bayou immediately below the town of Houston
assumes the most novel appearance. It does not
exceed thirty yards in width but is very deep, with
high steep banks covered with heavy dense timber,
whose limbs interlock from the opposite sides,
excluding the sun from its dark waters. It seems
to wind its way under the earth until, encountering
a high bluff immediately below the city, it divides
off into two branches, fixing at the point of
separation the head of all navigation Both
branches continue to diminish in water and timber
until, twenty-five miles above, all is lost in the
prairie (Weniger 1984:36).

Tidal habitats are dynamic and productive environments; sediments and nutrients are brought into and
out of marshes by tides and support complex
communities of plants, marine vertebrates and
invertebrates, waterfowl, and terrestrial animals.
Among the many grasses and rushes (Juncus spp.)
found in tidal environments are marshhay cordgrass
(Spartina patens), gulf cordgrass (S. spartinae),
seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), reeds
(Phragmites spp.), giant millet (Setaria magna),
seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum),

Chapter 2: Environmental Setting

Among the terrestrial reptiles and mammals found in
tidal marsh environments in the project area are
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina serpentina),
diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), river
cooter (Chrysemys concinna), mud turtle (Kinosternon
spp.), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus), and the American alligator
(Alligator mississippiensis) (Behler and King 1979;
Davis and Schmidly 1994; Takac et al. 2000). In the
past, bears, wolves, and buffalo were among the
permanent residents of Texas coastal environments
(Weniger 1997).

alligatorweed (Alternanthera philoxeroides), Olney
bulrush (Scirpus olneyi), California bulrush (S.
californicus), saltmarsh bulrush (S. maritimus), other
bulrushes (Scirpus spp.), cattail (Typha latifolia and
T. domingensis), and willow (Salix spp.) (Fisher et al.
1972; Gadus and Howard 1990; Takac et al. 2000;
White and Paine 1992).
Freshwater and saltwater marine species inhabiting
the waters include: sand trout (Cynoscion arenarius),
spotted sea trout (C. nebulosus), Atlantic croaker
(Micropogon undulatus), striped mullet (Mugil
cephalus), southern flounder (Paralichthys
lethostigma), shortnose gar (Lepisosteus platostomus),
channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), freshwater drum
(Aplodinotus grunniens), red drum (Sciaenops
ocellata), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Marine
invertebrates include many varieties of shellfish,
including: the brackish water clam, Rangia (Rangia
cuneata); dwarf surf clam (Mulinia lateralis); olive
nerite (Neritina [Vitta] reclivata); and brown Rangia
(Rangia flexuosa), and oyster (Crassostrea virginica)
in higher salinity waters (Gadus and Howard 1990;
Hopkins et al. 1973; Takac et al. 2000).

Riparian Hardwood Forests
Characteristic trees of the riparian woodlands in the
project area include: elm (Ulmus spp.); hackberry
(Celtis occidentalis); ash (Fraxinus spp.); sweetgum
(Liquidamber styraciflua); bois darc (Maclura
pomifera); loblolly pine (Pinus taeda); Magnolia spp.;
live oak (Quercus virginica); water oak (Q. nigra);
pecan (Carya illinoensis); and hickory (Carya spp.).
The understory consists of various forbs and grasses,
including: greenbrier (Smilax spp.); yaupon (Ilex
vomitoria); wild grapes (Vitis spp.); carpetgrass
(Axonopus spp.); and Bermuda grass (Cynodon
dactylon) (Fisher et al. 1972; Gadus and Howard 1990;
Takac et al. 2000). Animals attracted to wooded
riparian environments in the area include: white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus); eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus); jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus); eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus
carolinensis); fox squirrel (S. niger); opossum
(Didelphis virginiana); raccoon (Procyon lotor); gray
fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus); bobcat (Lynx rufus);
coyote (Canis latrans); striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis); red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis); and
various songbirds (Davis 1978; Davis and Schmidly
1994; Gadus and Howard 1990; Takac et al. 2000).

The seed-bearing grasses and marine food resources
in tidal marshes attract both resident and migratory
birds. A traveler out of Galveston remarked in 1856
that they encountered swarms of wild ducks, cranes,
and other kinds of wild fowl as they explored the
beaches in the area (Weniger 1984:88). Surfacefeeding ducks found in tidal marshes include mallard
(Anas platyrhynchos), mottled duck (A. fulvigula),
northern pintail (A. acuta), American wigeon (A.
americana), and teals (Anas spp.). Bay ducks such as
redhead (Aythya americana), canvasback (A.
valisineria), scaup (Aythya spp.), and ring-necked duck
(A. collaris), sea ducks like bufflehead (Bucephala
albeola) and common goldeneye (B. clangula), and
mergansers (Mergus spp.) are also common. Other
waterfowl utilizing the area include: cormorants
(Phalacrocorax spp.); pelicans (Phaethon spp.),
herons (Ardea spp.), and egrets (Egretta spp.) (Robbins
et al. 1983; Slack et al. 1992; Takac et al. 2000).

Coastal Prairies
Grasses are the dominant vegetation in coastal
prairies. Grasses found in the park include: bluestem

(Schizachyrium spp., Andropogon spp.); switchgrass
(Panicum virgatum); eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum
dactyloides); Paspalum spp.; and indiangrasses
(Sorghastrum spp.) (Gould 1975). A variety of forbs
and trees, such as live oak (Quercus virginica), ceder
elm (Ulmus crassifolia), and hackberry (Celtis spp.)
are also present (Fisher et al. 1972; Gadus and Howard
1990; Takac et al. 2000).
Animals attracted to prairie environments in the
project area include; deer (Odocoileus virginianus);
rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus); packrats (Neotoma
sp.); cotton rats (Sigmodon sp.); bobwhite quail (Colinus
virginianus); and prairie chickens (Tympanuchus
cupido) (Davis 1978; Davis and Schmidly 1994; Gadus
and Howard 1990; Takac et al. 2000).

Introduction

century (Newcomb 1961). Although the project area
may have been inhabited much earlier, the wet
environment, alluvial deposition, and other natural and
cultural forces have degraded the archaeological
record. Available paleoenvironmental data suggests
that modern climatic conditions were established by
approximately 2500 B.C. when the sea level reached
its current position (Aten 1983; Weed and Miller
1994), with the exception of occasional climatic
anomalies.

The following discussion of the cultural chronology
of the Gulf Coastal Plains serves as a general summary
of the temporal affiliation, types of prehistoric
properties (i.e., sites), and the range of material culture
that may be encountered within the historical park and
its immediate vicinity. Although mention is made of
selected archaeological properties within the project
area, the emphasis is on providing the reader a broad
culture historical context that characterizes changes
in material culture and adaptation through time. Within
the scope of this document, this context can be used
as a predictive foundation regarding the ages and types
of prehistoric sites that may be found within the project
area and their likely location given trends in land use
strategies.

The pre-Contact cultural chronology of the upper coast
of Texas can be divided into three major subdivisions:
the Paleoindian period (ca. 10,000 to 7000 B.C.), the
Archaic period (ca. 7000 B.C. to A.D. 100), and the Late
Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 100 to 1810) (Aten 1983;
Gadus and Howard 1990; Takac et al. 2000). The time
period covered by the Late Prehistoric period in the
upper Gulf Coast is sometimes referred to as the
Ceramic period, while others recognize both Late
Prehistoric and Ceramic periods during this time span
(c.f. Gadus and Howard 1990; Patterson 1995; Weed
and Miller 1994). For instance, in their discussion of
the cultural chronology of the Peggy Lake area, Gadus
and Howard (1990) discuss sites from this time period
as Ceramic period sites. Weed and Miller (1994)
summarize sites in the area that date from A.D. 100 to
A .D . 1810 as either Ceramic or Late Prehistoric.
Pattersons (1995) cultural chronology for southeast
Texas, which encompasses the project area, classifies
the same time span into four periods: Early Ceramic
(A .D. 100600), Late Prehistoric (A .D. 6001500),
Protohistoric (A.D. 15001700), and Historic Indian
( A . D . 17001800). Takac et al. (2000) use Late
Prehistoric-Woodland to refer to the time period from
A .D. 1001810, and reference Atens (1983) ceramic
seriation and cultural chronology for the Galveston
Bay area as background information for the assessment
of archaeological collections and sites discussed in
their report. For this report, sites in the project area
dating to this time period are referred to as Late
Prehistoric. Figure 3 shows the location of selected
prehistoric sites mentioned in the following sections.

The study area is located within an upper Gulf Coast
prairie and marsh environment. To those unfamiliar
with the area, this maze of swamps and thick
vegetation might seem inhospitable. In fact, the area
offers an abundance of diverse natural resources and
was home to numerous nomadic and semi-sedentary
indigenous groups for thousands of years. Suhm et al.
(1954:118) note that while most known archaeological
sites in the coastal area have been found along bay
shores, on islands, and near lagoons, inland sites
appear to be similar to those near the shores. A Clovis
point found in Harris County reveals that the earliest
human occupation of the area occurred some 10,000
years ago (Hester 1980a) during the Paleoindian
period. Scottsbluff, Plainview, Golondrina, and
Angostura points recovered elsewhere throughout
the upper coast provide additional evidence of
Paleoindian occupation of the region (Hester 1980a;
Suhm et al. 1954).
Earliest known occupation of the area covered by
the San Jacinto Battleground State Historical
Park dates to at least 1700 B.C. (Gadus and Howard
1990). Native American occupation of the area
continued intermittently well into the nineteenth

Paleoindian Period
(ca. 10,000 to 7000 B.C.)

Louisiana, and the Berclair Terrace site from the
central Texas coastal plain (Aten 1983) yielded
projectile points, including Clovis, possible Folsom,
Angostura, and Scottsbluff points, in possible
association with extinct fauna. By the Late Glacial
period (ca. 12,000 to 8000 B . C .) in Texas, most
woodland and parkland environments were being
replaced by scrub grasslands, a shift that was
eventually completed approximately 10,000 years ago
(Bryant and Shafer 1977).

The Paleoindian period covers the Late Pleistocene
and Early Holocene geologic periods, and is generally
characterized by the association of human cultural
remains with extinct fauna (Aten 1983; Hester 1980b).
Sites and artifacts attributable to the Paleoindian
period have been found throughout the United States.
Clovis points are characteristic of the earliest reliably
dated archaeological sites in North America.
Paleoindian artifact assemblages including stone
knives, scrapers, spear points, bone needles, and bone
spear shaft straighteners suggest lifeways that
emphasized hunting (Mignon 1997). Although these
artifacts are often found in association with the remains
of extinct megafauna, it is likely that hunting smaller
game animals and gathering of plant foods were more
common subsistence activities.

Arguably the highest profile Paleoindian sites are those
interpreted as megafauna kill sites. However, studies
have demonstrated that many, if not most, Paleoindian
peoples employed a diversified subsistence strategy
based on a wide range of small game and plants (Aten
1983; Hester 1980b; Johnson 1977). Furthermore,
Bryant and Shafer (1977:20) note that:
If one considers the paleoenvironmental, animal
behavior and habitat it is easily conceivable that
the so-called Paleoindian or big game hunting
concept may only have been applicable to the
Plains and peripheral Plains environments of
Texasif even there! We seriously doubt that big
game hunting would have been economically
sound as a major subsistence pattern in any of
the parkland and woodland areas of eastern Texas
where the species of big game were probably
dispersed or not present in large numbers.

Subsistence
Subsistence data showing human exploitation of nowextinct animals is lacking for the upper Gulf Coast
region (Aten 1983; Hester 1980a). Paleoenvironmental
data indicate that climatic conditions during the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period (ca. 20,500 to 12,000
B.C.) in Texas werein generalcooler and wetter
than the present, with less seasonal variation in
temperatures (Bryant and Shafer 1977). Deciduous
woodlands extended over much of the coastal region
during this time period and provided habitat for
browsing animals (Aten 1983). The recovery of extinct
elephant species, horse, bison, sloth, giant tortoise,
dire wolf, camel, saber tooth cat, armadillo, glyptodont, and capybara from deposits contemporaneous
with the earliest human settlement in the region of the
upper Gulf Coast suggest possible food resources for
early Paleoindian foragers (Aten 1983; Hester 1980a).
However, no clear-cut associations of human cultural
remains and extinct fauna have been identified at
Paleoindian sites in Texas. A few sites, such as the
Buckner Ranch site in Bee County (Suhm et al. 1954),
McFaddin Beach in Jefferson County (Hester 1980b;
Takac et al. 2000), the Salt Mine Valley site in southern

Their argument provides one explanation for the lack
of indisputable associations of Paleoindian artifact
assemblages with extinct game species.

Types of Sites
Most Paleoindian sites from the area are known from
surface recovery of isolated artifacts (Hester 1980a).
Gadus and Howard (1990) and Takac et al. (2000) note
that Paleoindian artifacts, while abundant on the upper
Gulf Coast, are largely from secondary or disturbed
contexts. Twenty-four sites with Paleoindian
components have been identified in Harris County
(Weed and Miller 1994). Lower sea levels during this

11

San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park

Chapter 3: Culture Historical Summary

Archaic Period
(ca. 7000 B.C. to A.D. 100)

period extended the coastline approximately 3040
km beyond its present location (Aten 1983; Gadus and
Howard 1990). Consequently, most Paleoindian sites
identified in the project area and in the upper Gulf
Coast region in general are representative of inland
occupations (Aten 1983). Sea levels began to rise with
the termination of glaciations at the end of the
Pleistocene and resulted in the inundation of many
coastal Paleoindian sites (Aten 1983; Gadus and
Howard 1990; Takac et al. 2000). Their resulting
inaccessibility renders archaeological data about
earliest human occupation of the Texas Gulf Coast
incomplete (Hester 1980a).

The next major cultural period is the Archaic, during
which time the level of the seas began to rise. The
Archaic period is marked by the extinction of
Pleistocene megafauna, termination of the Wisconsin
Glacial period, and the onset of essentially modern
climatic conditions. A hunting and gathering lifeway
continued, with a broad-based subsistence pattern.
Some researchers postulate a reduction in group
territories, with greater utilization of local lithic raw
material sources and an increase in the use of expedient
tools for certain tasks (Takac et al. 2000). The Archaic
period in Texas is further broken down into three
phases: Early Archaic (70003000 B . C.); Middle
Archaic (30001000 B.C.); and Late Archaic (1000 B.C.
to A.D. 100) (Aten 1983; Gadus and Howard 1990).
The number of archaeological sites increases during
the Middle Archaic, and are more numerous for the
Late Archaic.

Material Culture
Paleoindian sites along the upper Gulf Coast tend to
be identified primarily on the recovery of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points (Takac et al. 2000).
Unifacial scrapers and gravers and use of non-local
lithic materials also mark Paleoindian tool
assemblages. A single Scottsbluff point, from the
vicinity of Red Bluff (Hester 1980a; Gadus and
Howard 1990), Early Notched and Stemmed,
Plainview, San Patrice, Angostura, and Meserve points
have all been found in Harris County. In areas
immediately adjacent to the project area, a Meserve
point was recovered from dredged materials on the
west side of the San Jacinto River (Gadus and Howard
1990). One Clovis point was recovered from the
confluence of Hunting Bayou and Buffalo Bayou
(Gadus and Howard 1990). Weed and Miller (1994)
report that San Patrice points are the most commonlyrecovered projectile points in the project area, and were
recovered from 16 out of the 24 sites with Paleoindian
components. Patterson (1995), who divides the
Paleoindian period into Early (10,0008000 B.C.) and
Late (80006000 B.C.), notes that San Patrice points
are often found in association with Early Side-Notched
points. He also observes that there are considerable
data to indicate that San Patrice and Early SideNotched were the principal point types used in
southeast Texas during the Early Paleoindian period
(Patterson 1995:252).

Types of Sites
Very few Early Archaic sites have been identified in
the upper coast of Texas, possibly reflecting low
population densities in the area (Aten 1983; Gadus
and Howard 1990; Takac et al. 2000). During the Early
Archaic period, the shoreline reached 10 km beyond
its present day extent. The possibility exists that a
number of sites dating to the Early Archaic in the
project area and the upper coast region in general were
inundated with rising sea levels. In fact, though the
shoreline stabilized near its current location during
the Middle Archaic (30001000 B.C.), few sites in the
area predate 2000 B.C., after which time site density
and presumably populationsincreased (Gadus and
Howard 1990). Takac et al. (2000:16) observe that
this probably reflects the time needed for the
maturation of the barrier island system which in turn
permitted the establishment and expansion of
biotically rich estuaries capable of supporting large
human populations. Shell midden sites typify the
Middle Archaic in the project area. Many Archaic

12

San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park

Chapter 3: Culture Historical Summary

sites in the project area yielded evidence of reuse
throughout the time period (Weed and Miller 1994).
Sites, here, are far more numerous for the Late Archaic.
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric-Woodland period
archaeological deposits in the project area share many
characteristics and are often classified together (Gadus
and Howard 1990; Takac et al. 2000). The first
appearance of cemeteries in the Gulf Coast region
occurs during this time period, possibly indicating
increased territoriality and population densities (Gadus
and Howard 1990; Takac et al. 2000).

Miller (1994) report that Early and Middle Archaic
sites in the project area were largely sand middens.
However, information on sand midden sites in the
project area was not available from either Gadus and
Howard (1990) or Takac et al. (2000).
Shell middens, which first appeared in the area during
the Middle Archaic, provide the most substantial
information about indigenous land-use in the area as
early as the Middle Archaic. One of the earliest shell
midden sites is the Harris County Boys School site
(41HR80/85), which was intermittently occupied
from the Middle Archaic period to the Ceramic period
and dates from 1700 B.C. to A.D. 1650 (Aten et al.
1976). Straight-stemmed dart points and flake and
bifacial stone tools, including reworked tools,
comprised the artifact assemblage of the midden;
bone and shell tools were not recovered from the site.
Based on analysis of shellfish remains from the
midden, it was concluded that the site was occupied
primarily in August (Aten 1983).

Subsistence and Material Culture
Increasingly specialized tool kits were utilized by
indigenous peoples throughout Texas during the
Archaic period and reflect the exploitation of a wide
variety of plant and animal resources. While a broadspectrum foraging pattern was maintained, the
gathering and processing of wild plant foods appears
to have been emphasized (Hester 1980b). Archaic
period archaeological sites in Texas have yielded
projectile points, knives, ground stone axes, weights,
and ornaments; bone, antler, and shell awls, needles,
fishhooks, ornaments, and other goods; and polished
and ground stone tools such as milling stones (manos,
metates, pestles), pipes, atlatl weights, and net sinkers
(Hester 1980b). In the dry caves of the Lower Pecos
region, a wide array of basketry, nets, sandals, fur
clothing, and wooden implements have been recovered
(Suhm et al. 1954). Although perishable materials are
not preserved in archaeological deposits of the upper
Gulf Coast in Texas, it is possible that indigenous
peoples who occupied the area utilized objects similar
to those recovered from the dry caves during the
Archaic period.

The Peggy Lake study included a fairly extensive
investigation of four shell midden sites in 1988 (Gadus
and Howard 1990). Of the three middens, the one
located at the Worthington site (41HR124; Figure 3)
contained the oldest deposits, making it roughly
contemporaneous with the Harris County Boys School
midden. In addition to shellfish remains, the midden
also yielded skeletal remains of fish, turtle, and deer
throughout all levels, snake and raccoon from Archaic
period levels, and bison from the earliest period of
the sites occupation. As with the Harris County Boys
School site, the Worthington site was primarily utilized
during summer months. A number of stone tools were
recovered from the Worthington site, some of which
were made of non-local raw materials. Tools dating
from the Middle and Late Archaic/Early Ceramic
period included: numerous dart points and one arrow
point, bifaces, utilized flakes, hammerstones, a pumice
abrader, and one piece of worked siltstone. The site
also yielded bone and shell implements, such as an
ulna tool, socketed bone points, bone points, and antler
tools, unlike the Harris County Boys School site.

Twenty sites with Early Archaic components were
identified in the project area (Weed and Miller 1994).
Carrolton, Trinity, and Bell points were recovered,
with Carrolton points occurring with the highest
frequency. Twenty-four Middle Archaic sites were
located in the project area and were marked by
Bulverde, Pedernales, Kent, and Gary points. Bulverde
and Gary are the most common points. Weed and

Late Prehistoric Period
(ca. A.D. 100 to 1810)

Subsistence data recovered from shell middens in the
project area (41HR124, 41HR132, and 41HR581)
indicate that brackish and saltwater shellfish,
particularly Rangia species, were heavily exploited.
The freshwater species Polymesoda caroliniana was
also exploited steadily throughout the latter part of
the pre-Contact time-frame (Gadus and Howard 1990).
Vertebrate faunal remains found in Ceramic period
levels in the middens include fish, lizard, snake, turtle,
alligator, bird, opossum, deer, bison, rabbit, and rodent
remains (Gadus and Howard 1990).

The third major temporal subdivision of pre-Contact
occupation in the project area is the Late Prehistoric
period. Aten (1983) divides the Late Prehistoric into
six periods based on ceramic seriation. The Late
Prehistoric features the co-occurrence of sandy or clay
paste ceramics and dart points. Utilization of the bow
and arrow and grog-tempered ceramics were also
introduced during the Late Prehistoric, although sandy
paste ceramics and dart points apparently remained
in use (Gadus and Howard 1990).

Weed and Miller (1994), apparently utilizing a cultural
chronology similar to that detailed by Patterson (1995),
note that 50 Early Ceramic and 51 Late Prehistoric
sites have been identified in the project area. Cultural
materials recovered from Early Ceramic sites include
Gary, Kent, Ellis, Ensor, Yarbrough, Palmillas, and
Darl points, which also occur in the Late Archaic. Over
half the sites had no evidence of former occupancy.
Assemblages in Early Ceramic sites of the upper Gulf
Coast are actually not dominated by ceramics, and sites
dating to this period in the project area are marked by
the sporadic occurrence of sand-tempered Goose
Creek series ceramics. The Late Prehistoric sites
located in the project area occur in ecologically
marginal areas (Weed and Miller 1994). Most of the
Late Prehistoric sites had an Early Ceramic component
and yielded Goose Creek Plain, San Jacinto Plain, and
other surface modified varieties of ceramics. Lithic
artifacts recovered from Late Prehistoric sites in the
project area include Perdiz, Scallorn, Alba, and
Bonham points (Weed and Miller 1994).

Types of Sites
In the project area, shell midden sites are most
representative of the Late Prehistoric. Three shell
midden sites identified in the Peggy Lake area,
41HR124, 41HR132, and 41HR581, date to the
Ceramic period or have Ceramic period components.
Sites 41HR124 (1600 B.C. to A .D. 1650) and 41HR132
(A .D. 600 to 1300) yielded evidence of extensive
occupations. Site 41HR581 (A.D. 400 to 700) yielded
evidence of only moderate occupation. Earth middens
dating to the Late Prehistoric are also known in the
project area (Takac et al. 2000; Weed and Miller 1994).

Subsistence and Material Culture
Like their predecessors during the Archaic period,
indigenous peoples during the Ceramic period engaged
in a broad range of subsistence activities. These
activities, however, never involved agricultural
pursuits. Because the saline conditions of the local
marshes are not conducive to the production of
domesticates, horticulture was never a viable option
in the project area. Nevertheless, the native flora and
fauna was diverse and abundant enough to sustain a
fairly sizeable population. Generally, indigenous
peoples along the coast made use of sizeable shoreline
camps, which could accommodate several groups
during the fall and winter. During spring and summer,
these large groups dispersed inland, relocating often
in their pursuit of large terrestrial game, such as bison
and deer, and seasonal plant resources (Gadus and
Howard 1990; Ricklis 1996).

Site 41HR124 (Figure 3), the Worthington site, is a
multicomponent site that ranks among the earliest shell
middens in the upper coast region. Middle and Late
Archaic deposits at the site were summarized in the
discussion on the Archaic period. Ceramic period
artifact assemblages from the Worthington site yielded
lithic tools such as arrow points, dart points, drills and
perforators, a biface, pebble tools, utilized flakes, a
hammerstone, and bone tools including ulna tools,
fishhooks, socketed bone points, bone points, a single
antler tool, and numerous shell tools (Gadus and
Howard 1990). Chipped stone and other artifacts from
14

San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park

Chapter 3: Culture Historical Summary

41HR132 were limited (Gadus and Howard 1990).
Because the midden was heavily disturbed, only one
utilized flake tool could be assigned to a component.
Artifacts from the Redtail site, 41HR581 (Figure 3),
included arrow points, dart points, bifaces, one pebble
tool, tested pebbles, cores, debitage, one ulna tool,
one bone point, and several modified shells (Gadus
and Howard 1990). A variety of ceramics were found
in each midden as well, and are discussed below.

5) Old River Period (A.D. 1350 to A.D. 1700)
Grog-tempered wares declined, Goose Creek
wares resurged, and bone-tempered ceramics
peaked in use during the Old River period.
6) Orcoquisac Period (A.D. 1700 to A.D. 1810)
During this time period, grog-tempered wares
disappeared, and use of all other wares declined
with the exception of Goose Creek Plain.
European trade wares are present at some sites
dating to the Orcoquisac period.

Ceramic technology in the project area follows the
Galveston Bay chronology, and is further subdivided
into six units based on ceramic seriation and supported
by radiocarbon dates (Aten 1983; Gadus and Howard
1990; Takac et al. 2000). Summarized from Gadus and
Howard (1990), these temporal units are identified as:

Goose Creek Plain or Incised, Mandeville Plain,
Baytown Plain, var. San Jacinto or San Jacinto Incised,
var. Jamison ceramics were found in the early Ceramic
levels of the shell midden at the Worthington site,
41HR124. Turtle Bay/early Round Lake age deposits
included Baytown Plain, var. San Jacinto and San
Jacinto Incised, var. Jamison. Final occupation levels
at the site, late Round Lake to late Old River periods,
yielded one grog-tempered and one untempered vessel
section and a Goose Creek Plain or Incised body sherd
(Gadus and Howard 1990). Site 41HR132 was heavily
disturbed, but from undisturbed levels, Goose Creek
Plain or Incised ceramics were found (Gadus and
Howard 1990). Over 1,000 ceramic sherds were
recovered from the Redtail site, 41HR581. Most of
the sherds were undecorated and untempered sandy
paste of the Goose Creek Plain and Incised types, five
were incised untempered sandy paste, one was a grogtempered sandy paste plain sherd identified as
Baytown Plain, var. San Jacinto, and one was a
grog-tempered, clay/silt paste, plain sherd identified
as Baytown Plain, var. Phoenix Lake (Gadus and
Howard 1990).

1) Clear Lake Period (A.D. 100 to A.D. 425)
Characterized by the appearance and cooccurrence of Goose Creek Plain, Goose Creek
Incised, and Goose Creek Stamped, all indigenous
ceramic types, with non-local ceramics identified
as Tchefuncte Plain and Stamped, Mandeville
Plain, and ONeal Plain, var. Conway.
2) Mayes Island Period (A.D. 425 to A.D. 650)
Ceramic assemblages belonging to the Mayes
Island period include all Goose Creek wares. The
bow and arrow also appeared during the Mayes
Island phase.
3) Turtle Bay Period (A.D. 650 to A.D. 1000)
During the Turtle Bay period, Goose Creek wares
predominated. In particular, Goose Creek RedFilmed became more popular and Goose Creek
Incised design motifs became more elaborate.
Socketed bone points, first utilized in the upper
Gulf Coast during the Early Ceramic period, fell
out of use by A.D. 1000.

Conclusions
The project area is located on the upper Gulf Coast, a
region of prairies and marshes that offers bountiful
natural resources. Occupation of the area by nomadic
hunter-gatherers began at the end of the Late
Pleistocene and continued hosting both nomadic and
semi-sedentary indigenous groups for thousands of

4) Round Lake Period (A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1350)
The Round Lake period is marked by the
appearance of grog-tempered ceramics, including
San Jacinto Incised and Baytown Plain, and the
decline in popularity of sandy paste Goose Creek
wares.

areas, while short-term campsites would have been
occupied later in the season, and probably with greater
intersite seasonal variation, as groups departed the
aggregation locality to search out new resource areas.

years. Very little is known about the earliest cultural
sequences in the project area. Evidence for the
Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods comes largely
from isolated artifacts found in surface contexts.
Evidence for early indigenous lifeways becomes
more plentiful by the Middle Archaic, a time during
which sea levels stabilized and the barrier island
system developed. Earliest known occupation of the
area covered by the San Jacinto Battleground State
Historical Park dates to at least 1700 B.C., the latter
part of the Middle Archaic. Native American
occupation of the area continued into the nineteenth
century.
Subsistence patterns in the project area probably varied
little since Paleoindian times. Paleoenvironmental data
indicate that the area was not favorable habitat for
large herds of animals. Instead, a wide variety of plants,
small and medium game animals, birds, and riverine,
estuarine, and marine resources formed the dietary
basis of Native American peoples in the area for
thousands of years. Subsistence activities are reflected
in archaeological assemblages that typically yield a
diverse range of lithic, bone, shell, and ceramic
implements. Gadus and Howard (1990) note that after
approximately A.D. 1400, intensity of Native American
land-use in the area notably decreased. Their research
at Peggy Lake appears to indicate that two types of
occupation are represented by indigenous land-use and
settlement in the area. The Worthington site
(41HR124) and site 41HR132 represent frequent, longterm occupation by aggregated family groups who
engaged in a broad range of activities focused on tool
manufacture and resource processing preparatory to
group moves. By contrast, the Redtail site (41HR581),
represents infrequent, short-term occupation by small
groups who utilized the site for procuring and
processing marginal food resources. Gadus and
Howard (1990) conclude that aboriginal groups in the
area may have dispersed from cold-season base camps
in inland areas to littoral areas during the warm season.
Smaller-scale aggregation and dispersal were
characteristic of the littoral occupations as well.
Aggregation sites may have been occupied early in
the warm season as groups returned to known resource

which are in the broad project area: 41HR124130
(41HR130 was also inadvertently assigned the site
number 265 [Gadus and Howard 1990]), and
41HR133. In 1950, Worthington excavated a 15 by
35 foot area of 41HR124 to 34 inches below ground
surface, and a 1.5 by 18 foot area of 41HR126 (Gadus
and Howard 1990). Materials recovered from the two
sites are curated at TARL, and a brief report of those
investigations is included as Appendix H in Gadus
and Howard (1990).

Since the 1950s, the San Jacinto Battleground State
Historical Park site has been surveyed by a number of
avocational and professional archaeologists. The
archaeological work has focused largely on the area
from Buffalo Bayou to the mouth of Galveston Bay,
with particular attention focused on the area around
Peggy Lake. Table 1 lists twenty-one recorded sites
within the immediate vicinity of the park. Figures 3
and 4 show some of the more important prehistoric
and historic, respectively, archaeological sites within
the boundary or the immediate vicinity of the San
Jacinto Battlefield State Historical Park. Most of the
recorded sites are prehistoric shell middens, but a few
historic period sites are included. Since the earliest
surveys were conducted, researchers have recognized
the impact of erosion, subsidence, and development
upon cultural resources, especially those located near
the shorelines. Most recently, the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) revisited several of the
sites recorded in the 1950s. Surveyors were unable to
relocate many of them, probably as a consequence of
erosion, subsidence, and industrial activities (Takac
et al. 2000).

Neylands efforts focused on the lower reaches of
Buffalo Bayou, the eastern side of the Houston Ship
Channel, the Lost Lake area, and the Clear Creek
drainage (Takac et al. 2000). He recorded six
prehistoric sites, three of which were in the immediate
project area: 41HR33 and 41HR104105. These three
sites were shell middens. Site revisits by Takac et al.
(2000) revealed that with the exception of an upslope
portion of 41HR121 (not located in the project area),
none of Neylands sites had survived.

1960s
Members of HAS continued to conduct archaeological
survey and testing work on sites in the Peggy Lake
area throughout the 1960s and early 1970s (Gadus and
Howard 1990). In particular, Alan, Bruce, and Gary
Duke collected and observed prehistoric and historic
cultural remains, some reportedly affiliated with
the Battle of San Jacinto. The Dukes and William E.
Moore conducted limited excavations at 41HR133,
and curated the collections from the excavations
at TARL.

1950s
R. B. Worthington and Wayne Neyland, founding
members of the Houston Archeological Society (HAS),
were the first to conduct archaeological investigations
in the immediate vicinity of the San Jacinto
Battleground during the 1950s (Gadus and Howard
1990; Takac et al. 2000). Their work consisted
primarily of surface reconnaissance, salvage
excavations, and collecting. Many of the sites recorded
by Worthington and Neyland have since been
destroyed or rendered inaccessible by erosion or
subsidence. Worthington focused on the western shore
of Peggy Lake to the southern boundary of the San
Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park, and to
Barnes Island. He recorded 12 shell middens, eight of

In 1967, the Coastal Industrial Water Authority
(CIWA) was created to distribute water from Lake
Livingston to the Gulf Coast agricultural and industrial
area. In 1971, a portion of the CIWA project required
the excavation and installation of three 9-foot
diameter pipes across the western portion of the San
Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park along the

Lynchburg Ferry Road (Highway 134). In response to
these activities, archaeologists from Rice University
conducted archival research and archaeological survey
and testing along the route of the pipeline (Cartier and
Hole 1972; Takac et al. 2000). Using historical
accounts of the Battle of San Jacinto, the Rice
University archaeologists focused their attention on
the northwestern section of the park, the area of the
reflecting pool, and two areas close to southern park
boundaries, one of which extended beyond the
southern park boundary. A local property owner
informed them of his recovery of a cannonball and
saber fragment while plowing his land, located outside
of the parks southern boundary. However, because
his finds were located outside of the CIWA impact
area, no further investigations were conducted (Takac
et al. 2000). Takac et al. (2000:30) note that no
intact archaeological deposits related to the Battle of
San Jacinto were recovered by Rice University
archaeologists, and that in fact, no unambiguous
archeological deposits or artifacts directly attributable
to the battle have been located within the park.

shorelines, were in poor condition, having sustained
extensive damage due to wave action and subsidence.
The earth middens located in upland settings exhibited
excellent preservation. McGuff and Thomas also
unsuccessfully attempted to relocate 41HR33,
identified in the 1950s by Neyland. Site revisits in the
late 1990s led Takac et al. (2000) to conclude that the
site had been submerged.

1980s
In 1983, David Ing reported on testing for four
proposed dumpsites within the park, south of the
monument, but found no archaeological deposits
within the impact area (Ing 1983). In 1986, the Coastal
Water Authority (CWA, formerly CIWA), sponsored
surveys performed by R. Moore for Heartfield, Price,
and Greene (Moore 1986; Takac et al. 2000). The only
site within the immediate project area identified during
this survey was 41HR576, a historic site noted, but
not recorded, by Neyland in the 1950s. The site was
shovel tested after completion of a proton
magnetometer survey, and no significant deposits
related to the Battle of San Jacinto were located. In
1986 and 1988, Prewitt and Associates conducted
fieldwork on several sites at Peggy Lake (Gadus and
Howard 1990), four of which are located in the
immediate project area: 41HR124, 41HR127,
41HR129, and 41HR132. Artifact analyses were also
performed on collections from 41HR126 and
41HR133.

1970s
The first comprehensive professional survey of the
project area was undertaken by Paul McGuff and Mike
Thomas of the Texas Archeological Survey in 1973
(Gadus and Howard 1990; McGuff and Ford 1973;
Takac et al. 2000) to assess four alternative flood
control designs on existing cultural resources along
Burnet, Crystal, and Scott Bays. They newly identified
or revisited 27 prehistoric archaeological sites, 22 of
which had subsided or been affected by wave action.
They noted that wave action caused far more
destruction to archaeological sites than subsidence or
burial, which both tend to insulate sites from further
damage. In 1974, McGuff and Thomas surveyed the
Lost Lake and Hunting Bayou Disposal Areas as well
as the lower reaches of Buffalo Bayou and the Peggy
Lake Disposal Area (McGuff and Ford 1974; Takac
et al. 2000). Thirty-eight prehistoric archeological sites
(shell middens and earth middens) were recorded
during the 1974 surveys, 24 of which had originally
been recorded by Worthington and Neyland in the
1950s. Over half of the shell middens, located on

Extensive test excavations revealed that 41HR124, the
Worthington site, contains among the earliest preCeramic archaeological deposits in the Galveston Bay
area. Archaeological assemblages there cover a timespan of approximately 3,400 years, and provide
subsistence data on five major occupation periods: the
Middle (ca. 16001000 B.C.) and Late Archaic (ca.
1000 B. C.A . D. 100) through the Turtle Bay/early
Round Lake periods (ca. A.D. 1000), late Round Lake/
early Old River periods (ca. A.D. 13001450), and the
late Old River stage (ca. A.D. 1600) of the Ceramic
period (Gadus and Howard 1990). The most extensive
occupation at the site occurred during the Turtle Bay/
early Round Lake periods.
20

Chapter 4: Previous Investigations

Test excavations at site 41HR127, a deeply buried shell
deposit first recorded by Worthington in the 1950s,
revealed that the deposits are portions of old shell roads
constructed in the area during the late nineteenth or
early twentieth century. Prehistoric artifacts recovered
from the site were most likely from another shell
midden that was mined to construct the roads (Gadus
and Howard 1990). 41HR129 was thought to be a site
described as a shell midden by Worthington; however,
backhoe trenches revealed only a surface scatter of
shell, possibly related to a nearby historic site. It is
possible that the site identified by Prewitt and
Associates researchers as 41HR129 is not the same
site described by Worthington (Gadus and Howard
1990). Work at 41HR133, a shell midden identified
by Worthington in 1950, was limited to excavation of
three backhoe trenches before design modifications
of the Peggy Lake Disposal Area placed the site outside
of the impact area. It was noted that, although covered
with dense vegetation and exhibiting recent signs of
uncontrolled excavation, the site was 8090 percent
intact. Analysis of ceramic and lithic artifacts from
previous collections revealed a Round Lake or early
Old River period (A.D. 10001528) occupation of the
site. Faunal remains in the collections indicate a
subsistence based on deer, fish, turtles, and shellfish.

the San Jacinto Monument Marsh Unit northeast of
Santa Anna Bayou, and adjacent to the southwestern
bank of the bayou. Here, investigators located nine
prehistoric archaeological sites in the project area.
Sites newly recorded by Gray and Pape investigators
were designated SC (shell concentration) 1, SC 3,
SC 4, SC 5, and SC 6. Core samples taken from SC 1
revealed extensive disturbance to the site and no
cultural materials (Weed and Miller 1994). A 50 x 50cm shovel test excavated at SC 3 exposed six strata of
oyster and Rangia shell, and yielded a single chert
flake and fragment of chert shatter. Shovel tests at SC
4 led researchers to the conclusion that, although four
strata were identified, the lowermost stratum exhibited
soils typical of dredging spoil. Researchers concluded
that the shell scatter at SC 4 is a secondary deposit.
Similarly, SC 5 yielded shell mixed with historic debris
in all strata, and most likely represented redeposition
due to historic landscape alterations. Fives cores,
ranging in depth from 90 to 140 cm below ground
surface, were excavated at SC 6. Based on data
recovered from the core samples, researchers
concluded that SC 6 represented a shell midden. Two
of the core samples contained evidence of dense shell
lenses separated by sterile silts. The lenses were
composed of both burned and unburned whole valves
mixed with small fragments of animal bone.

In 1988, Ing conducted further testing along Buffalo
Bayou when the berth for the battleship Texas was
enlarged. This testing confirmed the results of previous
investigations undertaken by archaeologists from Rice
University in the 1970s; namely, that the area was
covered by an extensive overburden of dredge spoil
(Ing 1996).

As noted previously, the most recent archaeological
investigations in the project area were conducted by
researchers from TARL, who reassessed ten
archaeological sites along the Houston Ship Channel
(Takac et al. 2000).
Four of the sites in their study, 41HR33, 41HR104
105, and 41HR576, are located immediately southwest
of the San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park.
TARL researchers found no trace of intact Buffalo
Bayou alluvium or shell midden deposits at sites
41HR33 and 41HR104105, originally recorded by
Neyland in the 1950s. They conclude that the sites
have been either completely eroded or inundated along
the entire beach and bank line. Although the possibility
exists that some of the bayous original terrace and
associated archaeological deposits may still exist under

1990s
In March of 1994, archaeologists from Gray and Pape,
Inc., completed a Phase I archaeological survey of
areas within and adjacent to the San Jacinto
Battleground State Historical Park, primarily to assess
the condition of previously recorded sites in the area
and locate new sites and landforms on which sites
might be located (Weed and Miller 1994). The project
area was located east and west of the San Jacinto River
and Houston Ship Channel and encompassed most of

a deep mantle of sand and water within its current
channel, they were not untouched by erosion and are
unlikely to yield data warranting further investigation.
Site 41HR576 is a multicomponent historic site
recorded by Neyland in the late 1950s. Historically,
the site has been utilized as a San Jacinto Day picnic
ground and as a dumpsite by the San Jacinto Inn. Other
demonstrated or probable uses of the site include
activities related to travel on the Lynchburg-Harrisburg
Road, which runs through the area, possible remains
of a late-nineteenth or early-twentieth century
industrial or manufacturing facility, potential use of
ferries in the area by refugees during the Runaway
Scrape in 1836, and as a camp occupied by Texan
forces prior to and just after the Battle of San Jacinto
(Moore 1986; Takac et al. 2000). The site is largely
intact and accessible.

Conclusions
For five decades, the area covered by the San Jacinto
Battleground State Historical Park has been the subject
of much archaeological and historical research. Most
of the sites recorded within the immediate vicinity of
the park consist of prehistoric shell middens. The most
significant of these middens is 41HR124, the
Worthington site, from which valuable data on
indigenous land-use and settlement patterns spanning
3,400 years was recovered. Fewer historic sites have
been identified in the project area. However, recent
investigations at one historic site, 41HR576, may have
some important bearings on reconstructions of the
location and layout of the events associated with the
Battle of San Jacinto since historic materials recovered
from the site may indicate that the Texan camp
extended south of the current park boundary (see
Takac et al. 2000).

Introduction

and mission structures suffered considerable damage
by hurricanes in 1762 and 1766, and the mission was
subsequently abandoned in 1771 (Bolton 1970).

To understand the battle of San Jacinto and be able to
properly interpret its historic significance one needs
to place it within its historic context. The following
sections provide a brief historical background to the
event that lead up to and precipitated this historic
battle. This chapter also provides accounts of the actual
battle but places less emphasis on reconstructing the
location and layout of the battle within the park.
Correlating the events of the battle with actual
locations within the park will be the subject of a
later chapter.

Concerned with the failures and expense of
maintaining the vast northern frontier of New Spain,
the King dispatched the Marqués de Rubí to report on
the status of the outposts from the Gulf of California
to East Texas. His report reflected that in Texas only
two presidios would be maintained, San Antonio and
La Bahía, and that the East Texas efforts should be
abandoned (Chipman 1990). The face of the ownership
of vast portions of North America changed after the
treaties that ended the Seven Years War; the French
possessions east of the Mississippi were ceded to
England, and Spain gained control of the Louisiana
Territory, thus removing any immediate threat to her
frontier. Yet in October 1800, the treaty of San
Ildefonso returned the province of Louisiana to France,
which Napoleon then conveyed to the United States
three years later. Ironically, Spanish support of the
emerging colonies resulted in bringing a more
aggressive threat to her frontier.

The Spanish and Mexican Period
The Spanish interest along the coastal area of Texas
began with the arrival of Alonso Alvarez de Pineda in
1519, but their actual presence was highly sporadic
until 1716, when they began to settle the vast
wilderness as a buffer against the French intrusion in
the area. Despite extensive efforts to establish
settlements in the Los Adaes area of east Texas, the
lower Trinity basin area remained virtually unknown
territory other than reports from La Bahía of French
traders settling near the mouth of the Trinity River.
This prompted a reconnaissance by Joaquin Orobio
Basterra into the area in 1746. He found evidence of
the French, but concluded that it was limited to
periodic traders who arrived by sea (Chipman 1990).

In 1808, when Napoleon placed his brother, Joseph,
on the throne of Spain, a strong feeling of resentment
to this usurpation of the crown of Ferdinand VII
fostered a wave of resistance throughout the overseas
possessions. What had begun as resistance to French
imposition soon grew into a movement for total
independence (Rives 1913). The first movement in
Mexico was led by Fray Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla,
with an army of Indians, mestizos, and a few Creoles
who declared independence on September 16, 1810.
The following year, in January his army was routed,
and he was executed the following August. But the
growing desire for independence did not die with
Hidalgo, it served only to ripen the filibustering
ambitions of many to follow. In August 1812, José
Bernardo Maximiliano Gutiérrez de Lara, a follower
of Hidalgo, united with Augustus Magee, crossed the
Sabine River and captured Nacogdoches. Their
forces occupied La Bahía on November 7, where
Governor Manuel Salcedo placed them under siege.

Although reports of further activity persisted, it was
not until 1754 with the capture of three French traders
and two slaves at a trading post at the mouth of the
Trinity River that Spain actively moved to secure the
area. A garrison of troops was established at the site of
the trading post in May of 1756, and the new presidio
was named San Augustín de Ahumada. Two
missionaries from Zacatecas were assigned to establish
a mission among the Orcoquisac Indians to be named
Nuestra Señora de la Luz. This remote outpost was
located north of the site of Wallisville, east of the Trinity
River in present-day Chambers County. The presidio
23

Chapter 5: The Battle of San Jacinto

Upon Magees death in February 1813, Samuel
Kemper assumed command, and marched on San
Antoniothe seat of Spanish power in Texasthe
following month. The city surrendered on April 1st,
and 14 loyalist officers, including Salcedo, were
executed. In August, General Joaquín de Arredondo,
with 4,000 Spanish troops, defeated the insurgents near
the Medina River. His retribution was swift and
bloody. The frontier was a shambles, the property of
any suspected rebels confiscated, and the majority of
the men were either dead or had fled the country (Cox
1990). Among the officers of Arredondos command
was a young lieutenant, Antonio López de Santa Anna,
decorated for his bravery during the campaign.

and agreed upon the Plan of Iguala, the tide turned for
independence. Iturbide secured the capital on
September 27, 1821, and Mexico became an
independent nation. Among Iturbides principal aides
was one Lt. Colonel Antonio López de Santa Anna.
Shortly afterward, Iturbide announced that he had
assumed the throne of Montezuma, and declared
himself emperor. Late in 1822, now Brigadier General,
Antonio López de Santa Anna issued his Plan of Vera
Cruz proclaiming a republican regime, and by the
following spring Iturbide had fled and a republic was
proclaimed (Nofi 1990). When Austin, arriving around
that time with his colonists, found that the new
government refused to honor the grants from the old
government he immediately rushed to México City
and persuaded congress to pass a law effectively reestablishing the empresario program (Rives 1913).
The new plan offered heads of families a league and
labor of land (4,605 acres), and Austin, as empresario,
would receive 67,000 acres for each 200 families
that he introduced. The final immigration law was
passed by the new congress in August 1824, and
Austin was granted permission to settle 300 families
(Barker 1996).

Austins Colony
In December of 1820, a bankrupt lead miner from
Missouri, Moses Austin, arrived with a partial solution
to the lack of settlers in Texas. He requested the
authority begin a colony of Anglo-Americans under
the empresario (contractor) program. His petition was
granted on January 17, 1821, allowing him the right
to settle 300 families on 200,000 acres. However,
Moses Austin died shortly after his return to Missouri,
and the contract then passed to his son, Stephen Fuller
Austin. Stephen arrived in San Antonio in August
1821, and received Governor Martínez agreement to
carry the project forward. They agreed that the land
selected should lie along the coastal plain between
the San Antonio and Brazos rivers, and would allow
640 acres to each head of family, 320 acres for a wife,
320 acres for each child, and 80 acres per slave (Frantz
1976). Austin returned to New Orleans and published
the terms and invited colonists to immigrate. The
United States had been experiencing a long depression
since the war of 1812, and coupled with a financial
panic felt in 1819, Austin immediately found settlers
eager to accept his offer. The first colonists began to
arrive at Galveston in December 1821 (Barker 1996;
Cartier and Hole 1972).

Although the settlers had been arriving since 1821,
many locating near the San Jacinto River and
Galveston Bay area, the first legally sanctioned colony
grants were not issued until the summer of 1824.
Austin selected a site on the west bank of the Brazos
River on the old San Antonio Road (now two miles
east of Sealy in southeastern Austin County) to serve
as the unofficial capital of his colony, which he named
San Felipe de Austin. Here, assisted by the government
appointed land commissioner, the Baron de Bastrop,
he began to distribute grants to his first colonists, the
Old Three Hundred. By 1828, the community had
swelled to a population of about 200, with three general
stores, two taverns, a hotel, a blacksmith shop, and
some forty to fifty log cabins (Jackson 1996).
Among the first grants issued were to those who
had already settled along the San Jacinto River,
including the league grants of Arthur McCormick and
Nathaniel Lynch issued in August 1824 (Cartier and
Hole 1972). McCormick, an Irishman, had emigrated

Events in Mexico, however, were moving against
Spanish control of their New World colonies. Revolutionists increased their efforts on several fronts, and

from New Orleans with his wife, Margaret, and sons,
John and Michael (Kleiner 1996; United States District
Court [USDC] 1850). The McCormick league fronted
Buffalo Bayou on the north and was bounded by the
San Jacinto River to the east (Harris County Deed
Records [HCDR] 10:450). McCormick engaged a
neighboring settler, Dr. Johnson Calhoun Hunter, to
survey his league in December but drowned in what
later became Santa Anna Bay before he had paid for
the survey. The league passed to his widow, Margaret,
and his two sons. In November of 1826, Dr. Hunter
sued the widow for nonpayment of the survey plus
some medical expenses. The case was eventually
resolved in Margarets favor, but the disputed survey
would create difficulty in sales of the western portion
of the property in the 1840s (Freeman 1990).

fact that empresario Green C. DeWitt named his
capital after Rafael Gonzales, governor of Coahuila y
Texas, with the new township being provided a sixpound cannon for its defense. However, American
efforts proved to be far more successful than their
Mexican counterparts, apparently aided and abetted
by illegal immigrants from the north. By 1834, there
were approximately 15,000 Americans in Texas
opposed to a population of 4,000 Mexicans. In 1828,
faced with growing governmental concerns, Brigadier
General José Manuel Simeón de Mier y Terán was
directed to survey Texas and recommend actions for
its further development. His suggestions, incorporated
into law April 6, 1830, called for the prohibition of
slavery, the closing of the borders to Americans, the
establishment of customs houses, and limits to be
placed on the number of ports into the territory
(Henson 1996).

Nathaniel Lynch was born in New York State in 1786,
and married Frances Hubert shortly after the War of
1812. Lynch and his family moved to Portage des
Sioux, Territory of Missouri, about 1818 where he
operated a ferry. They came to Texas in 1822 on the
schooner Only Son as part of Austins Old Three
Hundred. The family settled on the eastern bank of
Buffalo Bayou and shortly afterward established a
ferry service. He finally received legal title to the
league on August 16, 1824 (Glass 1995). The Lynch
league, bounded on the west by the San Jacinto River,
extended from a line south of Muleshoe Lake to a point
on the north shore of Black Duck Bay and was across
the river northeast of the McCormick grant. Lynch
applied to the San Felipe Ayuntamiento (city council)
for permission to operate a public ferry in January of
1831 (Barker 1901). The ferry route ran from his land
and across the river to the opposite point of
McCormicks league on the western side of the bayou.
In 1834 or 1835, Lynch platted a portion of his property
along the road from the ferry landing into lots and
named the development Lynchburg (Glass 1995).

Colonel Juan Bradburnan American in Mexican
service since 1817was dispatched to establish a
garrison and customs house on Galveston Bay at a
fort he named Anahuac Nauatl (Place by the Water),
with Colonel George Fisher as collector of customs.
Arrogant, egotistical, and self-important, the two men
soon had the colony in an uproar. The situation came
to a head in the spring of 1832 when Bradburn arrested
and jailed several settlers, including William B. Travis,
a recent arrival who had become the acknowledged
leader among those favoring the separation of Texas
from Mexico. Colonel Domingo de Ugartecha,
commander of the garrison at Velasco, urged Bradburn
to release the prisoner, but he refused.
Within México, Major General Antonio López de
Santa Anna raised a revolt against President
Bustamante in favor of liberalism and restoration of
the Constitution of 1824. Supporting the cause of Santa
Anna, a considerable group of settlers marched upon
Anahuac, and Ugartecha was forced to oppose them.
After a three-day siege, Ugartecha was forced to
surrender and Colonel José de las Piedras, a supporter
of Santa Anna, marched from Nacogdoches,
recognized the legitimacy of the settlers demands and
removed Bradburn from command. With the approval
of Mier y Téran, now commanding general of Northern

Growing Unrest
The empresario program proved to be extremely
attractive as Americans and Mexicans, both, took
advantage of the generous offers of land. The apparently
mutual acceptance of the effort was reflected by the

Chapter 5: The Battle of San Jacinto

México and supporter as well, de las Piedras and his
troops sailed for México leaving Texas with no
garrison north of San Antonio (Nofi 1990).

increasing tension between the Texans and the
government. Angered by their refusal, Ugartecha
ordered Lieutenant Francisco Castañeda and a hundred
dragoons to procure the cannon. Texans from the
neighboring communities rallied to face the threat. On
October 2, 1835, the two forces faced each other across
the Guadalupe River, and as the morning fog lifted the
cannon opened fire. After a brief exchange of fire, the
dragoons withdrew to Béxar rather than provoke further
hostilities. Open resistance between the two sides had
begun; the revolution was set into motion (Barr 1990;
Hardin 1994).

In 1833, Santa Anna was elected president of México
as a liberal, but in 1834 he decided that the country
was not ready for democracy and emerged as an
autocratic centralist. As a result, in May of 1835, the
liberals of Zacatecas rose up to defy his authority. He
retaliated via a blistering campaign and brutal
repression, permitting his troops to two days of
violations and pillaging. More than two thousand
noncombatants were slain (Callcott 1996; Hardin
1994). In June, Colonel Martín Perfecto Cós, Santa
Annas brother-in-law, arrested the duly elected
governor and other officials of Coahuila y Texas,
dissolved the state legislature, and closed the courts.
Among the fleeing members of the government were
Lorenzo de Zavala and James Bowie. Santa Anna, by
now, had annulled all restraints of the constitution of
1824, and assumed dictatorial powers. The frontier
was heading towards open rebellion. On July 13, 1835,
Austin, after two years of incarceration in various
Mexican prisons under suspicion of inciting political
insurrection, was freed by a general amnesty law and
returned to Texas in August. He, who had fostered
cooperation and conciliation for over a decade, now
issued a call to arms declaring that a peaceful solution
was no longer possible. In response, General Cós sailed
for Texas with 500 men to disarm the colonists and
expel all who had arrived after 1830.

On September 20, General Cós landed his troops at
Copano Bay and proceeded to Béxar by way of La
Bahía (Goliad). A force of men under Captain James
Collingsworth marched toward La Bahía intent on
capturing Cós and the reputed $50,000 he carried in
his military chest. They arrived well after the force
had passed on to Béxar, but Cós had failed to reinforce
the garrison or to capture the presidio. As they
approached the fort, Benjamin Rush Milam, an early
settler in Spanish Texas, joined them. Milam had
escaped from a jail in Monterrey and was delighted to
join the rebels. In the early hours of October 10, the
fort fell with little resistance. This gave the rebels a
strategic position and much needed supplies. It also
cut the Mexican link for communication and
reinforcement from the sea, forcing the government
to resupply Cós only by the lengthy overland route
(Hardin 1994).
The two victories cheered the settlers and soon a
force of over 500 men poured into Gonzales and
unanimously elected Stephen Austin as commander.
On October 13, the untrained, undisciplined Army
of the People marched toward Béxar (San Antonio).
The morning of October 28, an advance party
commanded by James Bowie met a Mexican patrol
near Mission Concepcíon and a decisive victory was
achieved. General Cós withdrew his troops into the
fortified town establishing a defensive posture. Austin
elected to blockade Béxar and the Alamo across the
river. As the blockade wore on the enthusiasm and
discipline of the men steadily deteriorated, and by the
end of November many of the rebels had returned

The Revolution Begins
As is often the case, the beginning of hostilities arose
from a seemingly minor incident. A Mexican soldier
bludgeoned a citizen of DeWitts colony, alarming the
once loyal settlers, and convincing them that the tales
of centralist brutality were true. In the face of
increasingly hostile protests, Colonel Ugartecha sought
to protect his position in San Antonio. In September,
he dispatched a small component of soldiers to Gonzales
to demand the return of the cannon that had been given
to them for protection. The citizens of Gonzales had no
intention of handing over the cannon at this time of

Chapter 5: The Battle of San Jacinto

Santa Annas army, plagued by bitter cold, snow and
heavy rain, approached from Monclova to the Río
Grande (de la Peña 1975). The country was suffering
from what has been termed the little ice age that
produced decreased normal temperatures and
increased rainfall. This era reached a low period in
the mid 1830s, when an extreme blue norther struck
on February 13, dropping almost two feet of snow.
The army faltered and many died, but by the 15th the
vanguard reached the Río Grande. As February 23rd
dawned, Santa Anna stood before the Alamo, an
achievement that came as almost a complete surprise.
Ill prepared and heavily outnumbered, the small
garrison of the Alamo fell in the predawn hours of
March 5th, with only noncombatants remaining to
carry the story. The southern arm of the army,
commanded by Brigadier General Juan José Urrea,
swept across the coastal plain defeating all traces of
the rebels until it neared Colonel James Fannins
company at Goliad, the largest single body of troops
in the Texan army. On March 6th, Houston had
dispatched orders for Fannin to withdraw from Goliad
and join his forces at Gonzales, but because of delays
and indecision, Fannins command was captured in
the open near Coleto Creek and forced to surrender
on March 19th. The Texans were returned to Goliad,
and on orders of Santa Anna, were massacred on Palm
Sunday, March 27th.

home for the winter. Sam Houston urged that the
blockade be abandoned and the troops return to a
stronger position in east Texas. James Grant, a Scottish
immigrant, with extensive holdings in Coahuila,
proposed that the army be diverted to capture
Matamoros. Others, including the scout Erastus
Deaf Smith, urged an immediate attack upon Béxar.
Ben Milam stepped forward and called for volunteers
to make the attack. Three hundred joined him, and in
the early morning hours of December 5, the siege of
Béxar began. After four days of door-to-door fighting,
in which Ben Milam was fatally wounded, Cós was
forced to surrender and San Antonio was in the hands
of the Texans (Barr 1990; Hardin 1994). As the last
Mexican garrison withdrew toward the Río Grande,
the settlers assumed that this victory marked the end
of the warbut they underestimated the ability and
pride of Antonio López de Santa Anna.

The Counter Offensive
Even prior to his troops being under attack, Santa Anna
was considering ways to bring about the suppression
of the insurrection in Texas. By the time of Cós
surrender these plans were fully developed. He
realized that any rebellion against the central authority
must be eliminated before it could inspire others or
bring strength from the outside, as could Texas from
the United States. The traditional route for an invading
army would have been by sea. However, it would take
time to amass a fleet and winter was a perilous time to
attempt such an undertaking. The alternative was to
delay or execute a march overland and strike the
interior directly. By the time Cós surrendered, Santa
Anna had assembled 6,019 mennot counting those
in retreat with Cóstwenty-one fieldpieces, and
numerous support teamsters and camp followers at
San Luis Potosi (Hardin 1994).

The Runaway Scrape
As news of the fall of the Alamo reached the settlers,
panic began to spread among the families. The
apparent ease with which the Mexican army swept
through the forward defenses alarmed the settlers and
bolstered the confidence of Santa Anna that total defeat
was within his grasp. Houstons main concern was
maintaining his army while he instilled at least a
minimum of discipline. He realized that in order to
gain time he must fall back beyond the Colorado River.

Most rational leaders of the rebellion expected some
retaliation, but no one seemed to expect it to arrive
until spring. The Texan provisional government,
established in November, initially functioned fairly
well, but by the end of the year had fallen into political
chaos, and the army almost dissolved with only 100
men in San Antonio and another 500 or so at Goliad.

On March 14th, after resting his army following the
long march and battle at the Alamo, Santa Anna
dispatched Brigadier General Antonio Gaona, with
about eight-hundred men, northwest toward
Nacogdoches with orders to clear any possible
27

Chapter 5: The Battle of San Jacinto

resistance, and then sweep southward toward the
western bank of the Brazos River. General Urrea
was reinforced, bringing his strength to almost two
thousand men, and ordered to continue his advance
along the coastal plains. On March 29th, Santa Anna
departed Béxar with the remaining eight-hundred
men under General Ramírez y Sesma, moving
eastward toward Gonzales, intent upon crushing the
main Texan army.

the army, while others clamored for a new commander.
The disgruntled army reached San Felipe on the 28th.
After only one nights respite, Houston pushed them
over muddy roads and driving rain to the Jared Groce
plantation, some twenty miles to the north. After
Captains Moseley Baker and Wily Martin refused to
retreat further, Houston ordered them to remain and
guard the crossings (Barker 1901). During the next
several days Houston saw that the army rested, drilled,
and marched, hoping to instill some of the discipline
he felt they sorely lacked. On April 11th, they received
two six-pound cannons donated by the city of
Cincinnati.

The Texans moved steadily eastward with panicked
crowds of settlers, as well as members of the new
government, heading towards the safety of east Texas.
On March 17th, the army reached Burnhams ferry on
the Colorado River. Houston had retreated from
Gonzales with just under 400 volunteers, but additional
troops had almost doubled the size of the army.
Confident that with the arrival of Fannin he would
have sufficient force to meet the Mexican advance at
the Colorado, Houston paused and considered an
engagement. However, if Santa Anna was to be
engaged at that point, the possibility of a drive by Urrea
crossing the Brazos and striking the heartland of the
settlements was a real threat. For this reason, Houston
destroyed the ferry and marched down the east bank
to Beasons Crossing on March 19th (Hardin 1994;
Nofi 1990; Tolbert 1959). The spring rains continued
to be unusually heavy, and while demoralizing to the
Texans, they had swelled the streams and rivers
creating barriers to the pursuing Mexican army. On
March 21st, Ramírez y Sesmas contingent arrived
opposite Beasons crossing and confronted the Texans
on the eastern bank. Many, including new arrival
Sidney Sherman, demanded permission to take four
hundred of the men and engage the enemy. Houston
sagely refused, but gained an enemy within his own
ranks. Both sides waited on the swollen banks without
action, but Houston determined his plan to attack on
the 26th. However, on March 23rd, Houston received
the devastating news of Fannins defeat and capture,
and completely reversed his plans. He realized that
the army he commanded was Texas last hope, and he
would be ill advised to risk it with such unfavorable
odds. Rather than attack on the 26th, he ordered a
retreat to San Felipe. This brought forth vehement
protest from the ranks, and over two hundred men left

Confidence in Houstons desire to fight was still in
question. President David Burnet dispatched Secretary
of War, Thomas Jefferson Rusk, a letter of reprimand
that admonished him to attack and retreat no farther.
Although Rusk was authorized to take over the army
if Houston refused to comply, he instead listened to
Houstons arguments and joined him. On April 12th
they broke camp, and utilizing the steamer
Yellowstone, the force crossed the Brazos in two days.
Houston then led the army eastward, but with no
assurance of their destination.
Three days earlier, Santa Anna had led a small
contingent of troops down river and captured
Thompsons ferry, above Fort Bend, thus outflanking
Baker and Martin, forcing them to withdraw and join
Houston. Upon learning that the revolutionary
government had left Washington-on-the-Brazos and
moved to Harrisburg, he abandoned his pursuit
of Houston and turned his attention toward the
government. Santa Anna reasoned that he could
capture the rebel politicians and secure Galveston Bay,
thus cutting off all support from the sea, and the army
would no longer be a serious threat. He failed to
capture the government at Harrisburg, and pursued
them onward to New Washington (now Morgans
Point) with a vanguard of six to seven hundred men.
The main body remained with General Filisola at Fort
Bend (Barker 1901). En route, Santa Anna passed
through the league owned by William Vince, where
his aide, Colonel Juan Bringas acquired Old Whip, a
huge half-thoroughbred, black stallion belonging to
28

Chapter 5: The Battle of San Jacinto

Allen Vince. The horse would play an important role
in upcoming events (Tolbert 1959). Santa Anna arrived
at New Washington to find that the Texan officials
had escaped by only minutes. However, he was pleased
that he had driven the government off the mainland
and severed its connections with its army. His sole
task now was to block Houstons retreat and the
rebellion would be crushed.

they broke off the trail and took the road toward
Lynchs ferry (see Figure 5, in pocket folder in back)
and halted just before sunrise to prepare a breakfast
of freshly slaughtered beef. They had hardly started
their preparations when their scouts rushed in with
news that the enemy was at hand. Immediately, they
rushed to arms and moved to a point at the juncture of
Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River, the plain of
San Jacinto (Steele 1906). The enemy was, in fact,
Captain Barragan and a detachment of dragoons that
had been dispatched to reconnoiter Houstons location.
The patrol rushed back to report to Santa Anna, who
was still at New Washington with his remaining troops.
Upon hearing Barragans report, he mounted his horse
and raced off through the dense wood, crowded with
men and mules, shouting at the top of his voice, The
enemy are coming! The enemy are coming! causing
panic among the soldiers. After breaking out of the
woods, order was restored and the army formed up on
the prairie into an attack column (Delgado 1919). By
this time the Texans had won the race to the ferry
landing, arriving at a grove of live oak that skirted the
bayou just above the junction with the San Jacinto
River. On the far side of the river the scattered houses
that comprised Lynchburg could be seen, and behind
them, a low round hill with a crowd of people. Here,
were the Texas Tories waiting to pilot Santa Annas
army to the Sabine territory (James 1929).

Houston and his army were again on the march but
their destination was still uncertain to the men. On
April 17th, the army reached a fork in the road near
the boundary of present Montgomery and Harris
counties. This was a critical juncture for the future of
the campaign. The road straight ahead led to Robbins
ferry and the road to Nacogdoches led to Harrisburg
and the enemy. The fleeing families, mostly women
and children, urged Houston to escort them to safety,
while the men of the army were determined to take
the road to the right and fight. When the fork was
reached the command came, Column right
(Henderson 1956). It is still debated whether Houston
led, or was led to Harrisburg. The army entered the
charred ruins of the capital on the afternoon of April
18th. There, Houston was met by scouts Henry Karnes
and Deaf Smith with a captured Mexican courier.
The dispatch he carried was vital, for from that,
Houston learned that Santa Anna was personally at
the head of a small force at New Washington, and
isolated from the main body of his army. This was the
moment for which he had been waiting. His army
departed Harrisburg the next day, leaving behind those
too ill to fight and the encumbering baggage (Hardin
1994). Houston called his men around him in a hollow
square and delivered his only speech of the campaign,
informing them that they were to cross Buffalo Bayou
and meet the enemy. He ended his rhetoric with
Remember the Alamo! His men, thirsty for revenge,
eagerly echoed this battle cry (Labadie 1967).

By 2:00 P.M., Santa Anna had moved his troops onto
the prairie. He then deployed his soldiers toward the
Texan position to see if they could be drawn into battle.
The Texans returned fire and fell back into the woods.
Santa Anna then ordered the Toluca Company to
advance to a small elevation, within a hundred yards
of the trees, and open fire with their nine-pound
cannon. The Texans replied with good effect, but
Colonel Neal was wounded. On the Mexican side,
Captain Urizia was severely wounded and his horse
killed. The Mexicans then withdrew to a camp at a
point 1 mile distant, between the San Jacinto River
and a small bayou (Delgado 1919:33; Hill 1936:6).
Houston reported their position was:

The Battle
The army crossed the bayou, marched all night and
picked up the trail of Santa Annas forces. They
followed them across Vinces Bridge. At that point

wing of our army, from which an occasional

troops, until the enemy withdrew to a position on
the bank of the San Jacinto, about three quarters
of a mile from our encampment (Houston
1925:58889).

affording a favorable position, with an abundance
of water on my rear, a thick wood on my right, and
a large plain on my left (Castañeda 1956:34).
Shortly before sunset, Colonel Sherman requested
permission to reconnoiter the enemy lines. With sixtyone mounted riflemen, including Rusk, he moved out
toward the Mexican position. As soon as he saw the
enemy he foolishly ordered a charge. After firing their
first volley they were required to dismount and reload,
at this point, the enemy dragoons countercharged with
lance and saber. A hand-to-hand melee ensued. Rusk
would have been killed or captured but was saved by
the bold actions of one Private Mirabeau Lamar.
Sherman, realizing he was in considerable danger
requested infantry support, which Houston refused.
Captain Jesse Billingsley attempted to override the
commanders order but Houston commanded them to
countermarch. Sherman ordered his men to fall back
to the shelter of the woods, but his losses included
two wounded men and several dead horses (Billingsley
1966; Hardin 1994).

Another description of the scene stated:
The Texan army encamped in a narrow open
prairie, along the south bank of Buffalo Bayou,
in front was a skirting of timber, of some forty or
fifty yards in width, terminated again by open
prairie, which extended to the Mexican line, three
fourths of a mile distant. The Mexican army had
encamped in a line, with its right resting upon the
San Jacinto, and extending into a narrow skirting
of wood along the stream. The space between the
strip of wood along the Buffalo Bayou, in front of
the Texan encampment and the Mexican line, was
not entirely open prairie. At midway between, or
perhaps nearest the Mexican line, a point of timber
extended from the San Jacinto into the prairie
some two hundred yards; and nearly in the same
range, further out from the river was a small copse
of wood, or, in Texan phrase, an island of timber
(Niles 1838:348).

The Mexican force extended the right flank of their
infantry occupying an entire grove of timber along
the banks of the San Jacinto. They began the morning
of the 21st by constructing breastworks beginning at
the point of timber near the river and reaching out
towards the prairie. James Hill described the nature
of the defenses:

Colonel Delgado describes the encampment in this
manner:
We had the enemy on our right in a wood at long
musket-range. Our front, though level, exposed
to the fire of the enemy, who could keep up with
impunity from his sheltered position retreat was
easy for him on his rear and right, our own troops
had no space for maneuvering. We had at our rear
a small grove, reaching to the bay shore, which
extended to our right as far as New Washington
(Delgado 1919:35).
Santa Anna describes the site in a more favorable light,
naturally, since he had selected it:

The Mexicans had taken the apparahoes from their
pack mules and made breastworks of them. These
apparahoes were made of heavy sole leather,
stuffed with rolls of straw. They were a
cumbersome sort of packsaddle, but a mule that
wore one could easily carry three barrels of flour.
Santa Anna had in the neighborhood of 700 pack
mules, and when the apparahoes were placed
bottom upward on the ground they made a long
breastwork from 2-½ to 3 feet in height (Hill
1936:17).

I wished to draw him into a field of battle suited to
my purpose, and in consequence withdrew about
one thousand yards distance, to an eminence

In the center, an opening was left for the nine-pound
cannon, while their cavalry was positioned upon their
left flank (Houston 1925).
30

Chapter 5: The Battle of San Jacinto

The Texans were awakened at four oclock by reveille
beaten by a freedman named Dick, but to their disgust,
their commander had left orders not to be disturbed
(Schoen 1936). To add to their concern, around nine
oclock General Cós arrived with about 540
reinforcements. This brought Santa Annas strength
to about 1,200 compared to Houstons 910 (Hardin
1994). Houston ordered Deaf Smith to reconnoiter
the enemy camp and return with an estimate of their
strength. Upon his return the order was given to destroy
Vinces bridge. There are still conflicting opinions as
to how this idea originatedwhether it was suggested
by Smith or conceived by Houston. In either case, it is
often interpreted as a bold move that served to insure
that neither side could retreat, but in truth, it more
effectively served to block any further reinforcements
being sent to the Mexican army. There is also a great
deal of confusion as to exactly where the bridge in
question was located. It was initially accepted as
spanning Vinces Bayou, yet that branch of water is
scarcely three miles in length and would have offered
little impediment to either reinforcements or fugitives.
It is now generally accepted that it crossed Sims
Bayou, with its meanders some twenty miles in length.
Since it crosses the Allen Vince league with its deep
channels and steep banks, Sims Bayou is a more likely
site (Charlton 1965). At any rate, both sides were now
committed to combat.

The 1st regiment, commanded by Colonel
Burleson, was assigned the center. The second
regiment, under the command of Colonel
Sherman, formed the left wing of the army. The
artillery, under special command of Colonel
George W. Hockley, Inspector-General, was
placed on the right of the 1st regiment; and four
companies of infantry, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Millard, sustained the
artillery upon the right. Our cavalry, sixty-one in
number, commanded by Colonel Mirabeau B.
Lamar, (whose gallant and daring conduct on the
previous day had attracted the admiration of his
comrades, and called him to that station) placed
on our extreme right, completed our line (Houston
1925:590).
One report described the advance stating:
The infantry were thrown out in a line that
extended for a thousand yards, flanked at each
end by a cannon, with their flag flying in the center
(Gambrell and Nelson 1949:149).
The cavalry was initially deployed to the enemys left
flank to attract their attention while the main body
was deployed from the cover of the timber. The
artillery moved up to a point within two hundred yards
of the enemy breastwork in a position to begin a rain
of grapeshot on the fortifications. Colonel Shermans
infantry unit moved along well-concealed by the line
of trees at the marshlands by the river. The infantry
advanced across the open prairie in a single line, once
they were within a couple of hundred yards away from
the breastworks, the Mexican artillery and infantry
opened fire. While there may be some question
regarding this firing distance, the effective range of
muskets of the period was approximately 100150
yards while Twin Sister cannons, shooting scrap loads,
may have exceeded 200 yards (Eckhardt 2001). Since
the Texans were advancing up the slight slope in the
center of the prairie, the Mexicans overshot. The
Texans withheld their fire until they were about 70
yards from the fortifications, and then fired with great

Santa Anna fully expected Houstons attack the
previous evening, and, if not then, he was sure that
they would strike the morning of the 21st. When Cós
and his exhausted troops arrived he reasoned that they
may have been concerned because of their loss of
numerical superiority, but ordered his commander to
maintain the alert. When noon passed, and the early
afternoon of that day passed as well, he relaxed his
vigil. His cavalry unsaddled their horses, and the
infantry took time to eat or gain a bit of sleep. Santa
Anna himself retired to his tent.
It was then that Houston made his move. At half-past
three oclock he ordered the officers of the Texan army
to parade their respective commands:

31

Chapter 5: The Battle of San Jacinto

strength. As the enemy line began to falter, officers
attempted to rally their troops (Lane 1970).

The rout commenced at half-past four, and the
pursuit by the main army continued until twilight
(Houston 1925:590).

Colonel Sherman:

Houston attempted to reform his men and control the
slaughter, but to no avail. After three attempts he turned
his horse back to camp and said, Men, I can gain
victories for you, but damn your manners (Winters
1902:143).

determined to take possession of a point of
timber near the bank of the river, and perhaps 400
yards distant from the enemys encampment; from
thence to move down upon his right flank, or
rather in rear of his line advanced unobserved
(Coleman 1964:26).

Colonel Delgado described the flight:

Suddenly, they burst through the woods upon the
sleeping reinforcements of General Cós causing them
to panic and bolt across the rear of the line of troops.
Panic spread quickly and discipline within the ranks
dissolved. The battle continued, and as one observer
noted:

On the left, and about a musket-shot distant from
our camp, was a small grove, on the bay shore.
Our disbanded herd rushed for it, to obtain shelter
from the horrid slaughter carried on all over
the prairie by the bloodthirsty usurpers.
Unfortunately, we met, on our way, an obstacle
difficult to overcome. It was a bayou, not very
wide, but rather deep. The men on reaching it,
would helplessly crowd together, and were shot
down by the enemy, who was close enough not to
miss his aim. It was there that the greatest carnage
took place (Delgado 1919:36).

The ravine was passed by the Texans, and the
Mexicans at the same time entered a skirt of timber
which they used to some advantage. In the contest
for this wood a few very brave Texans fell amongst
them. It is painful but no more than just, for me to
record the glorious death of young Mr. Brigham,
an accomplished youth (Coleman 1964:27).

Later Ramon Caro, secretary to Santa Anna, described
his view of the site:

It was shortly after this last attempt at resistance that
the battle, for the Mexican troops, turned into an
overwhelming defeat. Some officers attempted to
restore ordernotably General Castrillion and
Colonel Almontebut their efforts had little effect.
Others fell to the ground to avoid the grapeshot raining
on the camp. Among those was Santa Annanewly
awakened from his rest. Santa Anna, perceiving that
all was lost, rapidly mounted his aides newly acquired
stallion, Old Whip, and stated he would attempt to
seek reinforcements from General Filisola, some forty
miles behind (Caro 1971; Delgado 1919). Houston,
in his official report, stated:

Wishing to satisfy my doubts, he led me to the
entrance of the road taken by our troops in their
flight, and there I saw, both to the right and to the
left, as far as the eye could see, a double file of
corpses, all men from our force. Moved by this
sad spectaclewould that it had been the last
I still had the more bitter sorrow of being
conducted a short distance to the left, where there
was a small creek, at the edge of the woods, where
the bodies were so thickly piled upon each other
that they formed a bridge across it (Caro
1971:124125).

The conflict in the breastworks lasted but a few
moments; many of the troops encountered hand
to hand, and not having the advantage of bayonets
on our side, our riflemen used their pieces as war
clubs, breaking many of them off at the breech.

Those who chose not to flee toward the morass that
fronted the lake met a similar fate on the prairie and
the road toward Vinces bridge. The mounted troops
making their escape were observed by Captain Karnes,
who quickly organized a small squad of about twenty
32

San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park

Chapter 5: The Battle of San Jacinto

men and set out in pursuit. Those who were able to
outrun death on the prairie arrived at Sims Bayou to
find their escape blocked by the destruction of the
bridge (Wharton 1930). When they found the bridge
gone, in desperation, many spurred their horses down
the steep banks, some became entangled with their
trapping and were drowned with their steeds, and
others mired attempting to climb the opposite bank.
All this as their pursuers fired with deadly accuracy
from the bank (Lester 1855).

from natural instinct, immediately returned to his
homeVinces plantation. Santa Anna now found
himself cut off at the same bayou where the bridge
had been destroyed. Unfamiliar with the territory, and
morbidly afraid of water, he was trapped. He changed
his clothes and managed to elude the searchers
until about eleven oclock on the 22nd, when he
was eventually captured and brought before Houston
(Caro 1971).
The carnage on the battlefield was appalling. Noah
Smithwick described it as he arrived shortly afterward:

The Aftermath

The dead Mexicans lay in piles, the survivors not
even asking permission to bury them, thinking,
perhaps, that, in return for the butchery they had
practiced, they might soon be lying dead
themselves. The buzzards and coyotes were
gathering to the feast, but it is a singular fact that
they singled out the dead horses, refusing to touch
the Mexicans, presumably because of the peppery
condition of the flesh. They lay there unmolested
and dried up, the cattle got to chewing the bones,
which so affected the milk that residents in the
vicinity had to dig trenches and bury them
(Smithwick 1983:92).

The battle was surprisingly one-sided. The official
report of Houston illustrates this in stark specifics:
In the battle, our loss was two killed and twentythree wounded, six of them mortally. The enemys
loss was 630 killed, among whom was one general
officer, four colonels, two lieutenant colonels, five
captains, twelve lieutenants. Wounded 208, of
which were five colonels, three lieutenantscolonels, two second-lieutenant-colonels, five
captains, one cadet. Prisoners 730 (Houston
1925:1516).
The report also detailed the huge amount of spoils
that had come with the victory:

The area soon became congested as the families
displaced by the retreat began the trek back to their
homes. The scene was likened to a camp meeting
with the families backed at the Lynchburg ferry (Gray
1965). Ramon Caro reported, that while a prisoner,
the Texans were forced to move their camp:

about 600 muskets, 300 sabers, and 200 pistols
have been collected since the action; several
hundred mules and horses were taken, and nearly
12,000 dollars in specie (Houston 1925:591).

because, though it was a mile away from our
former camp, the stench of so many corpses as
there were unburied and unburned, serving as food
for carrions, was unbearable (Caro 1971:128).

Houston was among the Texans wounded. A bullet
had shattered his right ankle. As he lay convalescing
under a large oak near Buffalo Bayou, there was one
factor that made the victory seem hollowSanta Anna
appeared to have escaped. The Texans knew that
General Filisolas large force lurked only forty miles
away and without Santa Anna as a prisoner, their
smaller force could easily be defeated. Santa Anna,
mounted on the excellent black stallion had easily
outdistanced his pursuers. He allowed the horse to have
his head, which proved to be his undoing. The horse,

The camp was moved three miles up Buffalo Bayou
to Dr. Patricks Deepwater plantation (Glass 1995).

considerably slowed, with only five of the 232 lots
sold (Glass 1995).

Resettlement of the region began soon after the battle
and the area experienced a period of strong growth in
the 1850s. Newly established settlements and
economic developments within the area not only
contributed an additional thread to the regions historic
fabric but also eventually led to organized interest in
commemorating the Battle of San Jacinto. In addition
to these contributions, these same factors also
impacted the prehistoric and preceding historic
resources of the region, including the prehistoric sites
and the former battlefield. This chapter describes the
settlement and economic developments that took place
in the region and the establishment and growth of the
San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park.
Summarizing the history of regional settlement and
economic development and the founding and growth
of the historical park allows us to document at least
some of the factors that may have impacted the existing
prehistoric and historic record of what is today the
State Historical Park and its immediate vicinity.

Area Development

The McCormicks returned to their league and resumed
working their plantation, but were interrupted by the
accidental death of their eldest son, John, in October
1839. Margaret and son, Michael, divided the property,
with Margaret receiving the three-fourth share
containing her home on the upper San Jacinto Bay
with the San Jacinto River to the north and northeast.
Michaels one-quarter share was pasture land on the
southwest (HCDR Vol. J:405406). Michael assumed
surety for a bad loan, and in July 1845, the Harris
County Sheriff sold 4,018 acres of the league to Josiah
Harrell. Harrell then transferred undivided interest to
Francis R. Lubbock and Magnus T. Rogers (Freeman
1990). Rogers sold three acres of the land to John
Stamps for the New Hope sawmill in March 1846
(see Figure 6), with a quit claim deed to the parcel of
land lying between the sawmill site and the town tract
of San Jacinto (Cartier and Hole 1972). In 1845,
Margaret McCormicks home burned and she perished
in the fire (Freeman 1990). Michael McCormick
became involved in the navigation and maritime trade
and moved to Galveston in 1846.

With Harrisburg destroyed, the area began to redevelop
although there was a shift in the economic structure.
Because of the death of John Harris in 1829, the town
failed to be rebuilt. The land was tied up in litigation
until 1838, leaving the area open to other settlement
growth. The entire area was ripe for development in
the new Republic and business interests rushed to take
advantage of the growth. The town of Houston, with
its sheltered inland location, grew from open prairie
platted in August of 1836, to a population of from
1,500 to 2,000 within its first 500 days. Shortly after
the battle, Nathaniel Lynch had the town of San
Jacinto platted on the east bank of the bayou (see
Figure 6, in pocket folder in back), hoping to attract
buyers among the tourist and souvenir hunters visiting
the battlegrounds. However, Lynch died less than a
year later, in February 1837, and development was

Among the early settlers in San Jacinto were J. Conrad,
Rosena Habermehl, and the freeman Wilkinson
families. The Habermehls had immigrated from
Wurtenburg, Germany in March 1860. They
constructed their two-story home on a small hill about
two hundred yards west of the present site of the San
Jacinto monument (Cartier and Hole 1972). The family
cemetery is near the site of the home (see Figure 6).
Wilkinson served in Captain Thomas McEntires
Company, and is buried in the cemetery in the Texan
campsite. His town lot in San Jacinto was Lot 27,
bounded northwest by Zavala Street, southwest by
Frost Street, southeast by Washington Street, and
northeast by the San Jacinto River (Glass 1995). Both
Lynchburg and San Jacinto developed a strong
economic basis in shipyards, building and repairing
ships for the entire bay area. Adjacent the sawmill were

two shipyards (Cartier and Hole 1972) also shown in
Figure 6.

Jacinto Chapter was formed three days later with the
avowed purpose:

Both Lynchburg and San Jacinto experienced a period
of strong growth in the 1850s as the shipping business
began to develop at the wharf facilities. Six river
steamers docked at Lynchburg twice daily, and the
cotton business was the mainstay of the trade.
However, on August 4, 1870, the legislature authorized
a company to construct a railroad in the city of
Galveston. This action allowed its wharf facilities to
be connected with the Galveston, Houston and
Henderson Railroad Company and any other railroad
that subsequently served Galveston. Construction of
the railroad began in 1870, and it was placed in
operation in January 1872 (Young 1996), striking a
severe blow to the river shipping trade. In 1875, when
a huge hurricane struck the Texas coast in midSeptember, it destroyed the port of Indianola on
Matagorda Bay. It swept up the coast doing
considerable damage to all the coastal cities and the
shipping trade (Weems 1986). The storm created a 20foot storm surge that swept away much of San Jacinto
and inundated the entire town of Lynchburg (Hoyt and
Schmidt 1996). A third factor that led to the eventual
decline of San Jacinto was the development of a ship
channel along Buffalo Bayou allowing direct access
to the port of Houston. The Buffalo Bayou Ship
Channel Company was formed in 1869, and dredging
began in 1870 on the portion known as the HoustonGalveston Ship Channel.

to urge the state to purchase the San Jacinto
Battlefield and erect a monument in commemoration of its heroes (DeVault 1999).
Betty Ballinger and Hally Bryan conceived the idea
of an association of women who were direct
descendants of the men and women who established
the Republic of Texas to support the preservation of
their heritage (Rash 1996). At the time the state held
ownership of ten acres of the tract, primarily in the
area of the plot where the slain had been buried. This
tract had been purchased in 1883 from J. Campbell
(Cartier and Hole 1972). Thus began, a series of small
fund-raising projects, among which were excursions
by steamer to the battlegrounds. In 1894, they
requested that the Texas Veterans Association appoint
a committee of knowledgeable members and
participants in the battle to mark the boundaries of
the site. In July, the first joint excursion of the
Daughters and the veterans was arranged to begin
planning to mark the boundaries. Veteran James M.
Hill produced a map of his recollections of the
battleground (DeVault 1999).
In 1898, the committee found it necessary to post a
notice that private burials on the state grounds were
prohibited. It appears that the locals were utilizing the
grounds as a form of potters field and cutting trees
for timber (Cartier and Hole 1972; DeVault 1999).
After years of petitions and lobbying, a bill was finally
passed by the Texas legislature to provide funding for
the purchase of battleground additional lands, but
funds were not immediately available. Finally, in 1901,
the state-appointed commission purchased an
additional 327 acres of the site. This purchase brought
the total state ownership to 337 acres (DeVault 1999).

San Jacinto Battleground Park
As early as 1856, a fund was established to erect a
monument at the grave of those who fell in the battle.
Francis R. Lubbock was in charge of the fund and it
was supplemented by a state appropriation of $1,000.
Near the graves of the first fallen soldiers, a community
cemetery, known as San Jacinto cemetery (see Figure
6), had developed where the citizens from the nearby
town were interred. November 1891 saw the formation
of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas (DRT) in
Houston, with Mrs. Anson Joneswidow of the last
president of the Republicelected president. The San

While the DRT was still striving to acquire the funds
to purchase the land, they had been actively planning
the permanent markers to designate the historic
spots. Present at the meeting held in 1894, were battleground veterans James M. Hill, L. C. Cunningham,

S. F. Sparks, J. W. McHorse, J. W. Winters, James M.
Harbour, Henry McCollough, J. R. Fenn, and F. R.
Lubbock. However, by 1903, when the state acquired
the property, only one of the remaining five living
participants in the battle was able to return to the
fieldJ. W. Winters, of Big Foot, Texas. Based upon
his recollections and previous discussions, the
committee placed twelve iron markers to commemorate significant events. These markers consisted of a
section of one-inch galvanized pipe, twelve feet in
length, driven nine feet into the ground. The intent
was to replace these markers with stone tables, once
funding and the land had been acquired. In 1906, the
chapters primary effortthe attempt to get legislative
support for funds to enclose the state propertywas
sidetracked by another effort of the DRT, preservation
of the Alamo Mission and grounds (DeVault 1999).

subsidence of the area required that the structure be
demolished, and a duplicate building was constructed
about 100 yards away (see Figure 6). In 1987, the
business closed. The Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department purchased the 9.88 acres, and the owners
donated an additional 19.31-acre tract (Ing 1996).

The San Jacinto Monument
As the hundredth year of Texas independence
approached, the movement for a centennial celebration
grew in the state. Based upon a speech by James
Stephen Hogg given in 1900, the Advertising Clubs
of Texas began a campaign to make it a reality at their
annual convention in 1923. A temporary Texas
Centennial Commission was appointed on December
28, 1931, and in 1932 a constitutional amendment
authorizing a centennial celebration and instructing
the legislature to make adequate financial provision
for the same was proposed. The amendment passed,
and a permanent Texas Centennial Commission was
appointed in June 1934. By this time the nation was
in the throes of the depression, but the election of the
Democratic administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt
created the Work Progress Administration (WPA) to
create jobs with federal monies. One of the projects
selected was the construction of a suitable monument
to be erected on the battleground of San Jacinto. A
total of $1.5 million dollars was appropriated for such
a monument. It was architect Alfred Finn, and engineer
Robert J. Cummins who developed the design from a
concept suggested by Jesse H. Jones, chairman of the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Texas
Centennial Commission. The construction contract
was awarded to Warren S. Bellows Construction
Company (Knepper 1996).

On April 21, 1910, San Jacintos battleground park
had its opening. Two concrete landings, 100 feet in
length and 1,100 feet apart, and a crescent promenade
had been constructed near the waters edge. The banks
were terraced and dressed with Bermuda grass. An
artesian well had been dug to provide drinking water,
the driveway around the cemetery had been initiated,
and double iron gates had been donated by the Texas
Hardware Association. The work to complete the
installation of the 2,000-pound granite boulders
marking the salient points was in progress. By 1915,
the commission was able to purchase the 15-acre strip
of land running beside the channel. An ornate pavilion
and keepers lodge was under construction, which
included restrooms and dressing rooms. The granite
markers, now numbering twenty, had been installed
on concrete bases.
In 1916, Jack and Bertha Sanders established a small
lunch counter near the Lynchburg ferry. The facility
soon outgrew its initial location and was moved to an
old dance hall near the northwest corner of the state
park. In 1926 the structure was destroyed by fire and
a new building erected and reopened in 1927. The
restaurant (San Jacinto Inn) soon gained worldwide
acclaim serving 72,000 pounds of fish, 60,000
chickens, and 160,000 pounds of shrimp to the public
and visiting dignitaries in an average year. In 1977,

Pat Fleming and Albert Sheppard were selected for
the landscape design. The design for the monument
was selected well in advance of construction, but the
landscape team dictated the actual placement of the
structure. The initial concept was to place it near the
edge of the water at Buffalo Bayou, but Fleming and
Sheppard suggested that the pollution of the channel
would badly stain the white marble base. They instead
36

San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park

Chapter 6: Development of the Region and Founding of the Park

recommended that the structure be moved to the center
area of the battleground between the camps of the
opposing forces. The actual placement was, in fact,
selected because it was on the highest piece of ground
in the park, some fifty feet above sea level. They also
designed the reflecting pool, 1,750 feet long and 200
feet wide, to mirror the reflection of the shaft
(Marchiafava 1996).

establish a permanent berth at the battlegrounds on
the Houston Ship Channel. The United States Navy
turned the ship over to the state, and she was
recommissioned as the flagship of the Texas Navy on
April 21, 1948. The 68th Legislature transferred the
ship to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in
1983 (Ing 1996).

The base of the monument is 124 feet square, five
feet thick at the outside and 15 feet in the center and
necessitated by the nature of the red clay soilan
integral mass footing. During the excavation of the
base a concrete seal slab, three inches thick, was
immediately poured to prevent drying of the clay and
to serve as a floor for the placement of the reinforcing
steel. Once the massive steel support structure was in
place the foundation required a continuous pouring
of 5,700 cubic yards of concrete. To comply with
federal WPA guidelines, all labor had to come from
relief rolls from cities and towns within a twentymile radius (Bullen 1938). The construction was
accomplished between 1936 and 1939.
The fund of $1,000, established in 1856, to procure a
monument to the fallen heroes of the battle had been
entrusted to the San Jacinto Chapter of the DRT in
1901, where it had been carefully invested and
occasionally augmented by small sales and excursion
fees. Several suitable monuments had been considered,
but none had received final approval. In 1928, the
chapter established the San Jacinto Monument Fund
to consider a proper memorial. In 1938, the committee
selected a bronze armillary sundial designed by Julian
Muench to honor the fallen men. The landscape
designers, Fleming and Sheppard, designed the
pavilion for the sculpture. For those arriving by water
it is the first thing visible and carries the eye along
the axis of the monument and the reflecting pool. It
was officially dedicated December 21st, 1940
(DeVault 1999).
At the end of World War II, the battleship Texas, a
dreadnought-class battleship built in 1912, was
scheduled to be sold as scrap. The citizens of Texas
raised money to tow the old warship to Texas and

Chapter 7: Development Goals and the Management of
Cultural Resources at San Jacinto State Historical Park
The successful implementation of at least some of
these recommendations hinges on answers to some
critical questions including: 1) how did the natural
setting, topography, and landscape of the project area
change since the battle; 2) where exactly did the events
and activities associated with the battle take place
within the historical park; and 3) how and where can
additional cultural resources be discovered (see
Chapter 8).

Introduction
The Master Plan (Matthai Associates 1998) for the
park identifies six main goals. Of these, the following
three impact the cultural resources of the park most
directly: 1) preserve the parks significant cultural,
historical, and natural resources; 2) enhance interpretation; and 3) provide recreational opportunities
compatible with the parks commemorative purpose.
To implement the main goals of the Master Plan, eight
recommendations were made. These recommendations
are relatively general, however, since even if partially
implemented they have the potential to impact the
cultural and historical resources of the park, they are
listed below:

The first of these aspects is significant because changes
to the landscape and natural setting may mask and
impede the discovery of the location of the battlefield
and may have influenced the preservation of battlerelated archaeological remains as well as other material
culture representative of prehistoric and other historic
components present within the park. In addition,
knowledge of the natural setting at the time of the battle
allows planners and managers of the park to
reconstruct the setting and landscape at the time of
the battle and this allows visitors to more directly
experience and visualize the events that transpired.
The second of these issues is important in accurately
identifying and portraying the location of the events
associated with the battle and in assuring that no
development-related damage will occur to battlerelated portions of the historical park, without fully
understanding the nature and implications of those
impacts. The remainder of this chapter considers
each of these issues in separate sections, by first
summarizing the changes to the natural setting and
landscape of the area, and next, objectively evaluating
the evidence available to reconstruct the location of
the activities surrounding the battle (i.e., camps,
battlefield, and graves), and other cultural resources.

1) To the extent feasible, restore the battleground
to its 1836 condition of prairie, marshes, and
trees;
2) Relocate as many support facilities and
recreational elements as feasible away from
the main battle area;
3) Relocate as many non-battle-related commemorative elements as feasible to a new
Commemoration Zone located away from the
main area of the battle;
4) Construct a new Museum/Visitor Center and
parking away from the main area of the battle;
5) Provide more access to the waters edge with
nature trails and walkways;
6) Minimize vehicular traffic on the battleground;
7) Control erosion along the waters edge; and

Impacts on the Historical Park and
Its Cultural Resources

8) Give every site element a prominent setting
where conflicts with the main battleground
are avoided and interpretation is enhanced.

Even prior to the battle and continuing today, anthropogenic factors have combined with natural forces
to significantly impact the prehistoric and historic

to the site of excavation as possible (i.e., on frontage
tracts) through the use of low-pressure drainage pipes.
Two types of spoil related to two types of dredging
was produced: maintenance dredging conducted to
clean out recent bottom deposits occurred on a regular
basis and was relatively viscous, while dredging to
widen or deepen the channels (i.e., new work dredging)
resulted in more-viscous spoil. While the first
necessitated levees or natural basins in order to contain
it, the second could be stacked with relative ease even
on high ground (Ted Hollingsworth, personal
communication 2002). Understanding the goals and
economics of dredging can help inform us about the
original landscape and about the impact it may have
had on cultural resources.

resources of the area. Some of the contributing anthropogenic factors, such as the settlement and
development of the area following the battle, the
establishment of the historical park, and the
construction of the monument have been introduced
in the previous chapter. In this section, the impacts of
two additional anthropogenic factors, dredging and
subsidence, are discussed. The principal natural forces,
hurricanes and associated beach erosion, also will be
discussed. Documenting and understanding the
combined effect of natural and anthropogenic forces
upon the prehistoric and historic sites, material
remains, and natural landscape of the State Historical
Park is critical in assessing the likelihood of the
survival and nature of the archaeological record within
the park and the methods and techniques necessary to
investigate those remains. This section reconstructs,
to the degree possible, the impacts of the anthropogenic and natural forces on the prehistoric and
historic archaeological record of the historical park
and its vicinity.

A visitor to the park in 1930 would have clearly seen
a high ridge, running from southeast to northwest,
overlooking a relatively low-lying marshy area that
extended from Buffalo Bayou on the northwest to
Peggys Lake on the southeast (Figure 7). This bluff
line is present on a very precise topographic map of
the area made by U.S. Army Corps engineers in 1913
(Figure 8, in pocket folder in back), it is also shown in
an 1897 topographic map (Hole 1972:Figure 13), and
was present during the battle. The tree line that lined
at least a portion of it may have played an important
role during the battle to conceal some of Shermans
troops as they advanced on the Mexican positions.

Anthropogenic and Natural Forces
of Change
First conceived in 1869, dredging of the channel to
accommodate deep draft vessels actually commenced
in 1870 in Buffalo Bayou and below its confluence with
the San Jacinto River. By 1909, the channel had been
dredged to a depth of 18.5 feet (6 m). In 1913 the bottom
width of Buffalo Bayou was 100 feet (30.5 m). By 1914,
efforts to dredge the channel to a depth of 25 feet (8 m)
were completed. The United States Army Corps of
Engineers constructed Barker Dam to impound Buffalo
Bayou in 1945. An especially intensive period of
dredging was undertaken during the 1950s (Cartier and
Hole 1972). In the 1990s, the channel remained at its
maximum200 feet wide and 40 feet deep (61 x 12 m;
Sibley 1999). Between the summers of 2002 and 2003,
the channel will be widened to 250 feet (76 m) and
deepened to 45 feet (14 m).

An additional aspect of the setting is importanta
high rise along the right descending bank of Buffalo
Bayou formed a natural river levee that curved
eastward at the confluence of the river, then tapered
sharply. The northern most edge of the Texan camp
appears to have been positioned at the highest and
southwestern-most portion of this levee on the right
descending bank of Buffalo Bayou (see Figure 5). It
is likely that the old Harrisburg-Lynchburg Road was
placed at the apex of this levee as it curved around the
western edge of the tidal marsh (see Hole 1972:Figure
13). The area south and east of the levee was a tidal
marsh that would flood on a seasonal basis. A number
of factors are important about these aspects of
the landscape.

For practical and economic reasons the spoil, composed
primarily of mud and clay, was to be deposited as close

Chapter 7: Development and Management of Cultural Resources

The earliest dredging that occurred along the
bayou and the river probably took place along
the crescent shaped natural levee. However, it is not
well documented whether it resulted in the deposition
of spoil within the tidal marsh or only on the natural
levee and in its immediate vicinity. While new work
spoil could have been deposited anywhere,
maintenance sludge would have to have been stored
behind the natural levee in the tidal marsh. On the
1897 topographic map of the area, the HarrisburgLynchburg road curves around the western edge of
the marsh immediately after its juncture with the New
Washington road (see Hole 1972:Figure 13; Matthai
Associates 1998:A15). It also curves around the marsh
on the 1913 topographic map (Figure 8), and a small
rise is even notable in the marsh proper, just east of
the road and north of the bluff line. At the same time,
the natural ravine that ran into the tidal marsh along
the west side of the prairie near the HarrisburgLynchburg road is still shown, although it appears to
have been dammed (or a levee has been built across
its mouth) by this time. Finally, the curving of the road
and the natural rise in the marsh are still present
and visible in an aerial photograph dating to 1930
(Figure 7). This would suggest that the marsh had still
not been filled in sufficiently to allow the rerouting of
Highway 134 to the town of San Jacinto in a more
direct line.

that no dumping of dredge spoil would have been
allowed in the portion of the historical park where the
markers were situated following the placement of the
original twelve markers.
The chronological sequence of dredging and spoil
deposition is important in that it allows us to derive
expectations regarding the age of temporal diagnostic
artifacts which may be encountered buried under the
sludge deposits. For instance, if the assumed location
of the Texan Camp was covered by spoil by 1903, the
artifacts found on the original ground surface should
date no later than 1903.
Although it is difficult to accurately estimate the depth
of the spoil layer deposited across these areas,
monitoring of various construction and site
improvement activities over the years has allowed
archaeologists to determine the precise depth of spoil
in a number of selected areas in the west-central
portion of the park. Archaeological testing along a
proposed waterline immediately west of the reflection
pool allowed Hole (1972) to establish that the spoil
cap varied from less than a foot to seven feet in
thickness along the waterline (see Figure 9, in pocket
folder in back). At the northwest corner of the park,
excavation for the battleship Texas berth in 1989
revealed only traces of the 1927 site of the San Jacinto
Inn atop dredge spoil about three feet thick (Ing 1996).
The overall depth of the dredge spoil in the area was
even deeper ranging between five and nearly seven
feet (Figure 9). Finally, Coastal Resource Coordinator
Ted Hollingsworth, documented between less than
a foot to six feet of spoil along the south side of
the reflecting pool and south of Park Road 1836
(Figure 9). A milkglass or porcelain cup encountered
at a depth of 1.5 meters was found just east of
Battleground Road (SH134) under 60 inches (1.5 m)
of dredge fill. It is unclear whether the cup was
recovered from within the spoil or was at the contact
between the original ground surface and the spoil layer.
The cup dates to the early part of the twentieth century
(perhaps around 1910), however, given that its
recovery context is not clearly determined, it is unclear
exactly what event it is associated with.

These observations are important for a number of
reasons. First they indicate that in 1913 there still had
not been extremely thick layers of spoil deposited in
the western edge of the marsh. Secondly, they indicate
that any spoil found in the area of the park that falls
south and west of the Reflection Pool, and extending
over to the assumed Texan camp location, would have
been deposited prior to 1913. This latter observation
is supported by the fact that the small picnic area roads
immediately east of the boat docks on Buffalo Bayou
appear on the 1913 topographic map of the historical
park and are present in the 1930 aerial photo, but are
absent in the 1897 tracing (Hole 1972:Figure 13). In
addition, the markers related to the various events of
the battle were placed in 1903 and the Reflection Pool
was built between 1936 and 1939. One can assume

41

Chapter 7: Development and Management of Cultural Resources

Based on a compilation of observations derived from
archaeological monitoring within the historical park
and summaries provided by Weed and Miller
(1994:Figure 13), two major periods of spoil deposition impacting somewhat distinct portions of the
park can be recognized. Figure 10 (in pocket folder in
back) is a composite of the two major periods of
dredging and spoil deposition within the historical
park. Much of the mud and clay resulting from the
early period of dredging (18701930) was deposited
in the northwestern portion of the park and along the
extreme northern shoreline of the channel adjacent the
park. Given no noticeable changes to the shoreline
and its vicinity, it is likely that little spoil disposal
occurred in the park during the later portion of this
period between 1913 and 1930. Spoil from the second
phase of dredging (19311971) was deposited
primarily in Santa Anna Bayou (see Weed and Miller
1994:Figure 13). Extensive levee construction within
the tidal marsh during the 1950s allowed substantial
amounts of spoil to be deposited and built up across
the marsh (Figure 10).

In addition to impacting prehistoric and historic
properties, a secondary impact of spoil deposition may
have been a slow but gradual change to the landscape
and natural setting within the park. For instance, the
deposition of significant amounts of spoil in the area
south and west of the Reflection Pool prior to 1913
may have resulted in the filling-in of a gully that may
have played a critical role in the Battle of San Jacinto
(compare Figures 5 and 9). This gully may have served
to conceal the advancing Texan armies as they
prepared to charge the Mexican forces. An additional
significant aspect of this is that this area may be in the
vicinity of where the Texan units formed up in a line
and may contain some battle related artifacts (see Pohl
1989:34). If so, the recently documented thinner cap
of the spoil in this area suggests that dredge material
may have been removed from the center of the area to
build the Reflection Pool. Archaeological remains
should be encountered relatively near the surface here
but more deeply buried on either side of the ravine
where the spoil is up to six feet deep. Finally, the
assumed tendency of spoil to collect more thickly in
the deeper areas also suggests that only a relatively
thin layer of maintenance dredging spoil may be
covering the northwestern edge of the high levee where
the Texans are assumed to have camped. This may be
encouraging in that it would potentially cost
significantly less to uncover the remains of the camp.
However, dredging spoil derived from new work is
more viscous and is more likely to remain in place,
perhaps allowing for thicker accumulations.

The deposition of spoil following dredging would have
clearly impacted any prehistoric cultural resources
found along the natural levee. One of the possibilities
is that repeated dredging to widen the bottom width
of the channel may have resulted in the undercutting
of the levee and its erosion into the channel.
Subsequent dredging could have resulted in the
redeposition of the cultural materials along the banks
of the shipping channel. If such undercutting and
erosion did not take place, however, because the levee
was higher than the adjacent marsh, the depth of the
spoil that may have potentially been deposited on top
of prehistoric properties (i.e., sites) would likely be
thinner than the depth of the spoil within the marsh
proper if the levee itself was being used as a barrier to
hold spoil within the tidal marsh. This could potentially
mean that it may have been possible to encounter
prehistoric cultural materials in the area of the former
levee along the northeastern portion of the San Jacinto
River channel. However, this area is now submerged
under the waters of the Houston Ship Channel
(Mayfield 1994).

The deposition of thick layers of dredge spoil in the
tidal marsh and the gully south of the Mexican camp,
particularly between 1930 and 1971, may have great
significance. Although these dredge operations tended
to center on the southeastern portion of the marsh (see
Figure 11, aerial photo from 1953), they may still have
impacted both prehistoric remains (i.e., on the low
levee) and battle-related remains. At least one account
of the battle (Pohl 1989) indicates that the Mexican
forces retreated into the marsh and became entrapped
as the Texans shot them down in large numbers. It is
possible that the marsh became the mass grave of these
combatants. The deposition of thick layers of spoil

across this portion of the marsh and gully would
effectively decrease the likelihood of cost-effective
archaeological recovery, although it may actually help
preserve organic remains (Glob 1969).

The 1953 aerial photograph (Figure 11) indicates that
dredging spoil largely covered the tidal marsh (see
also Figure 10), south of an east-northeast trending
levy. Over half of the fill area present in the 1953 aerial
photograph has since subsided into Santa Anna Bayou
(Figure 13). A park road crossing a small inlet eastsoutheast of the monument had become inundated by
1971. The 1964 aerial photograph revealed that the
majority of the levees that were part of a complex
system of levies constructed within the marsh during
the 1950s were underwater (Weed and Miller 1994).
The 1971 aerial photograph indicates that dredging
spoil was deposited in the northeast portion of the park
at its narrowest point within the marsh. The landscape
designers noted that the extensive subsidence has led
to a situation in which with certain tides the area of
the Reflection Pool becomes totally overcome with
water. They further commented:

A second factor in landform alteration is the general
subsidence that has been experienced throughout the
area. The two principal causes of land surface
subsidence in the Galveston-Houston area can be
attributed to petroleum production and groundwater
withdrawal. Subsidence due to oil and gas production
was first recorded in 1918 at the Goose Creek Oil Field
located towards the southeast near Baytown. However,
the major area of that subsidence is limited to an area
under four square miles, and probably does not
contribute significantly to the problem near the park.
The abatement within the park area is generally
regarded as a result of groundwater withdrawal from
the Chicot and Evangeline aquifers by large industrial
wells beginning as early as 1918. Large-scale
withdrawals have created a decline in artesian heads
throughout Houston and Baytown, and adjoining
counties. The measured land surface subsidence in the
Galveston-Houston area for the thirty years prior to
1973 ranges from 5½ to six feet (Hoyt and Schmidt
1996). The Harris-Galveston County Subsidence
District maps (1996) show eight to ten feet of total
subsidence (see also Mayfield 1994).

The reflecting basin area has settled so much that
the water actually flows across the basin side to
side (Marchiafava 1996).
By the mid-1990s, many older fill areas and the entire
northern tip of the park had become inundated due
to subsidence.
Land subsidence has also inundated lower elevations
of the San Jacinto River valley, obliterating traces of
archaeological sites identified in the 1950s (Gadus and
Howard 1990). According to the Harris-Galveston
County Subsidence District maps (1996), subsidence
in the project area ceased in 1979 when surface water
replaced groundwater for both municipal and industrial
uses. Still, Takac et al. (2000:1) estimate that localized
areas of subsidence on the order of several meters
has resulted in shoreline changes (mainly loss) of up
to several hundred meters over the past 75 years.
According to Ted Hollingsworth (personal communication 2002), shoreline change due to subsidence
and erosion within the boundaries of the park varies
from almost none to about 700 feet (213 m).

Using aerial photographs from 1930, 1953, 1964, and
1971, Weed and Miller (1994) documented changes
to the landscape within San Jacinto Battleground State
Historical Park. The 1930 aerial photograph (Figure
7) exhibits public roads extending southeast of the San
Jacinto Monument (see also 1935 map by Weed and
Miller 1994:Figure 13) that are now completely
inundated and may have been so since 1982 (see Figure
12, 1982 aerial photograph). The community of San
Jacinto, once situated at the northern tip of the San
Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park, is also
inundated and has been so since at least 1982. Dredge
spoil deposits on the eastern shore of the park were
located on lands that have since subsided into the
channel (compare aerial photo from 1953 to 2001
photo [Figures 11 and 13]), while wave action has
redeposited some of the fill onto the present-day beach.

Erosion, caused by ship wakes, is the third principal
type of impact on the landscape of the historical
park. The high-energy wave action acerbates the

rapid and significant shoreline changes (Hoyt and
Schmidt 1996).

Galveston and remains one of the most devastating
hurricanes in American history. It inundated the entire
island with a twenty-foot surge and winds of 125 mph,
causing $30 million in damage, and a loss of
approximately 6,000 lives. The surge swept into the
San Jacinto River basin, causing extensive damage
(Hoyt and Schmidt 1996). In September of 1961,
hurricane Carla struck the Texas coast flooding
approximately 694 square miles of lowlands in the
Galveston-Houston area with a storm surge of between

Finally, flooding due to hurricane tidal surges may also
have been a minor contributing factor to shoreline
erosion. In 1872 the town of San Jacinto had a
population of just over 170 persons. It is likely that
the devastating storms of 1875 and 1900 swept away
many of the buildings and remnants of the settlement.
The storm of September 8th, 1900 was centered upon

13.6 and 14.7 feet above mean sea level. Other storms
were to followhurricane Beulah hit seven years after
Carla, and, although less intense, flooded
approximately 270 square miles of coastal lands with
surges of 4.4 feet above mean sea level recorded. On
August 18, 1983, hurricane Alicia made landfall at
San Luis Pass with recorded winds of 115 mph and a
12-foot storm surge; 240 square miles of the coast were
inundated. This storm caused 21 deaths and damages

of about $3 billion. Water levels in the San Jacinto
area reached approximately 11.5 feet above normal.
Takac et al. (2000) have estimated that, as a result of
these erosion episodes, the terrace edges along Buffalo
Bayou and the San Jacinto River in the northern and
eastern portions of the park have receded several
hundred feet from their configuration at the time of
the battle. Even by 1924, the great live oak where Santa

complicated the accurate placement of events
associated with the battle. In 1894, as soon as the San
Jacinto Chapter of the DRT began to foresee that funds
were forthcoming for the purchase of additional
parkland, they attempted to gather a group of veterans
to delineate the actual limits of the battle site. With
the assistance of the Texas Veterans Association, they
were able to assemble five of the participants to visit
the site and recount their memories of events and
locations. Many of the veterans had never visited the
battlefield after the fight and yet all recognized their
respective camps (Hill 1936:4). This was nearly sixty
years after the battle, after shoreline alteration and
reported timber cuttingpossibly due to the nearby
New Hope sawmill at San Jacinto. Colonel Hill stated
that when the group arrived at the site of the Texan
camp, they were perplexed at how few trees were still
standing as compared to 1836. Colonel Hill also noted
that the bayou has been cutting in toward the south,
and that the place is much nearer the waters edge
now than it was when the fight took place (Hill
1936:17).

Anna was presented to Houston had washed away
into the river (DeVault 1999). Today, due to the
combined effect of erosion and subsidence, only
portions of 17 lots remain above the waterline in the
area that once contained the 232 lots that were part of
the town of San Jacinto. It is highly unlikely that the
remaining lots contain more than a few structures,
since land sales were slow, the most desirable lots were
river frontage and have since submerged, and the major
focus of the settlement was directed toward support
of shipping along the San Jacinto River.
Nonetheless, detailed examination of the northern
portion of the 1913 topographic map (Figure 8) and
the 1930 aerial photograph (Figure 7) does indicate
that some occupied lots may remain on shore above
the present waterline. This possibility should be
explored with on-the-ground survey.

Reconstructions of the Battlefield
Although there is a wealth of information about the
battle, including primary and secondary sources in
both English and Spanish, information regarding the
physical placement of the principal areas of the
struggle is by no means clear-cut. In addition,
observers contradict the few details that are given and
the understandable biases among the combatants, on
both sides, make many of the details subject to
criticism.

By 1903, when the appropriation was finally approved
to purchase the additional 327 acres, only one of the
remaining five living participants in the battle was able
to return to the field. Based upon his recollections and
previous discussions, the committee placed twelve iron
markers to commemorate significant events.
Subsequently, eight additional markers were placed
amounting to a total of twenty markers. It may be
reasonable to assume that the placement of the markers
was at least in part directed to insure that they were
all kept on state-owned property.

Perhaps even more importantly, however, the
landscape adjacent the San Jacinto River and Buffalo
Bayou bears little resemblance to that which existed
during the early historic occupation and the battle
period. Weed and Miller (1994:40) remarked that
artificial fill has created solid land where it
historically did not exist, while subsidence has
inundated large areas which had formerly been lowlying shoreline or embayed marshlands.

If we can assume that the Harrisburg-Lynchburg and
New Washington Road intersection is correctly
identified (Ted Hollingsworth, personal communication 2002) and is accurately depicted on the
1897 tracing (Hole 1972:Figure 13), accounts of the
battle indicate that the Texan camp was scattered
in the woods at, or just west of, this intersection
(Figure 5). This location agrees well with the location
of the original twelve markers placed in the park in
1903. If the camp began near this intersection and
continued south along the natural levee that fronted

Anthropogenic and natural agents have combined to

Battle of San Jacinto and may have also confused and

Buffalo Bayou, it is possible that it may have extended
south of the current boundaries of the historical park
(a point that we will return to later in the discussion).
The Texan soldiers would have been facing the
Mexican lines situated to the east across a small
northeast to southwest running drainage, and on top
of or behind a slight ridge. The right flank of the
Mexican armies is described as having been against a
line of trees, perhaps part of the grove of trees depicted
in the 1897 topographic map as lining the high bluff
overlooking the tidal marsh (probably referred to as
the San Jacinto River in accounts).

open prairie, in a line that extended for a thousand
yards, advancing up the slight slope in the center of
the prairie on the east side of the drainage about a
half-mile away from the Mexican breastworks.
Delgado describes the flight of the routed army as
toward a small grove, on the bay shore, but on their
way they encountered a bayou, not very wide, but
deep, where they were grouped and slaughtered. This
location may have been an attempt to cross the
unnamed tributary depicted as a narrow stream within
the tidal marsh on the 1897 topographic map (Hole
1972:Figure 13), or more likely, the ravine located
south of the Mexican camp. This map also shows lines
of trees across or east of the bayou, lining the
descending right shore of the San Jacinto River. The
flight of the mounted unit, including Santa Anna and
his secretary, was across the prairie toward the location
of Vinces bridge some eight to ten miles away.

Early accounts of the placement of the Texan camp
state that the camp was in  a grove of live oak that
skirted the bayou just above the junction with the San
Jacinto River (James 1929). By mid-afternoon, when
the Mexican forces arrived, Santa Anna had moved
his troops into the prairie; he then deployed his
skirmishers toward the Texan position to see if they
could be drawn into battle. The Texans returned fire
and fell back into the woods. Santa Anna then ordered
the Toluca Company to advance to a small elevation,
within a hundred yards of the trees, and open fire with
the nine-pound cannon. After this brief exchange, he
pulled his troops back to what was described by
Houston (1925:588589) as a piece of timber within
rifle shot of the left wing of our army, from which an
occasional interchange of small arms took place
between the troops, until the enemy withdrew to a
position on the bank of the San Jacinto, about three
quarters of a mile from our encampment.

This reconstruction and placement of the events
associated with the battle is not unanimously agreed
upon and it differs in detail from a number of others
(e.g., Moore 1986; Takac et al. 2000). For instance,
based on research on the road patterns of the original
routes of the Harrisburg-Lynchburg and New
Washington roads, Takac et al. (2000) suggest that the
Texan camp would have been well south of the
presently recognized location within the parklands.
Part of this reconstruction is based on the interpretation
that the Harrisburg-Lynchburg and New Washington
road intersection is farther south of that depicted on
Figure 5.

The Mexican camp is also stated to have been about
one mile distant, between the San Jacinto River and a
small bayou. This has become known as Santa Anna
Bayou. There is also mention of a point of timber
midway between the forces, extending from the river
into the prairie some two hundred yards, and farther
from the river a small copse of woods (Niles 1838).

In fact, both Moore (1986) and Takac et al. (2000)
place the Texan camp at site 41HR576, immediately
south of the park boundary based on re-evaluation of
written and oral accounts of the battle, detailed
examination of early topographic maps and aerial
photos, and the provenience of artifacts reportedly
found south of the parks boundaries, including a
Mexican cannonball, broken saber blade, gunflint,
musket parts, and a Mexican eagle hat medallion. It is
possible that these artifacts do indicate that some
activities associated with or related to the battle (i.e.,
camping) may have taken place south of the current
park boundaries. However, this location would not

These same lines of trees could have given Shermans
troops cover during their surprise advance on the right
flank of the Mexican troops in the afternoon of the
21st. On the other hand, the main infantry movement
is from the grove of trees of their camp across the

necessarily rule out the possibility that the northern
flank of the Texan army was at or in the vicinity of the
markers placed in 1903 near the Harrisburg-Lynchburg
Road and New Washington Road intersection depicted
in Figure 5. This is especially likely if the intersection
that the Takac et al. (2000:Figure 43) team suspected
to be the Harrisburg-Lynchburg and New Washington
is actually a later road that did fall outside of the
present park boundaries.

played a significant role in its outcome (i.e., the tree
line, the ravine). On the other hand, a careful review
of the impact of anthropogenic and natural forces upon
the landscape of the historical park has helped identify
the types, scale, and nature of landscape changes that
have occurred across the area since the battle. Although
the actual archaeological identification of the locations
of the battle-related events mentioned above still
remains, assuming that the reconstruction presented
above is accurate, even if only in broad terms, a number
of large scale modifications are necessary to return
the visual aspect of the historical park to that present
at the time of the battle. These landscape and natural
setting changes include the following:

Takac et al. (2000:115) summarize their conclusions
by noting that:
If these are in fact those routes (or nearly those
routes), which seems reasonable based on what
is known of the historical topography and
descriptions, then the Texan camp falls well south
of the areas identified within the state park.
Instead, it would then appear that the Texans
would have been strung out along the wooded
valley margin immediately above the wedge of
Buffalo Bayou alluvium sediments visible on
Figure 43 Such a placement would also remove
the Texans somewhat from the main portion of
the unnamed bayou immediately in their front (if
they were only within the current park area) and
place them at the edge of a wide, grassy plain as
described in nearly all of the accounts the
descriptions of Houstons interception of Santa
Annas troops at the junction of these roads and
of the camps facing each other directly across a
wide prairie is more consistent with the Texan
camp being south of the state park. Again, this is
consistent with the apparent location of known
battle-related artifacts being found south of
the park.

1) Remove the Reflection Pool and monument;
2) Recreate the drainage that separated the Texan
and Mexican camps;
3) Plant trees along the southern descending
bank of Buffalo Bayou where the Texan camp
is presumed to have been located and along
the bluff overlooking the tidal marsh to
recreate the cover used by Shermans troops
and the Mexican soldiers;
4) Clear the remainder of the center of the park
and return it to a prairie with the exception of
the few oak mottes that are described to have
existed scattered across the open prairie; and,
5) Slow and eventual elimination of shore
erosion, particularly in the vicinity of the
Texan camp to arrest its loss.
These changes would allow prospective visitors to
readily grasp the strategic and military implications
and significance of the positioning of the two armies.
The changes would also facilitate visitors understanding of the flow of the battle and aid in the
recognition of the significant role factors such as the
ravine or tree line played in its outcome. Of course,
landscape changes of the scale suggested above, either
to recreate the visual context of the battle, or to mitigate
the potential impact of future park development, will

In summary, the positive identification of the
Harrisburg-Lynchburg Road and New Washington
Road intersection allows us to more confidently place
the location of some of the events associated with the
battle. However, the various accounts of the battle do
not provide sufficient detail to unmistakably locate
the activities associated with the Battle of San Jacinto.
However, they do provide a general depiction of the
natural setting and of specific aspects that may have

run the risk of impacting both prehistoric and historic
properties. The next section outlines and provides
suggested strategies, methods, and techniques needed
in order to successfully implement the development
suggestions presented in the Master Plan without
the destruction of cultural properties within the
historical park.

Discovering Prehistoric and
Historic Properties

as a result of previous archaeological work at the park.
Photographs of soil profiles and the liberal use of video
recorders to visually document aspects such as depths
of disturbances across various parts of the park will
be critical for future reconstructions and interpretations. A single comprehensive map showing the
location of all previous archaeological survey
boundaries, construction activities and impacts (i.e.,
electric lines, water lines, old park roads, etc.), and
archaeological sites needs to be produced as soon as
possible. This will allow a rapid visual assessment of
what areas have been previously surveyed, where
construction impact has taken place, and the location
of all known sites. Such a record will be critical,
particularly 5075 years from now after the park
manager has changed numerous times. This map needs
to exist in an electronic format (i.e., AUTOCAD or
ArcView) so that it may be quickly updated and all
coordinates need to be geo-referenced so that an
accurate long-term record of changes in landforms and
shorelines (i.e., due to subsidence and erosion) can be
maintained.

Although the focus of the historical park may be the
Battle of San Jacinto, prehistoric and other historic
properties also can be incorporated into the theme of
the park to enrich the interpretive panorama offered
to visitors. The first step in assembling the multitude
of potential interpretive components or elements of
the park is to obtain as complete an inventory of
prehistoric and historic cultural resources as possible.
The second step is to identify as closely as possible
the placement of the events associated with the
San Jacinto battle. In pursuing either or both of these
goals, project management considerations become
crucial. Issues related to project management are
discussed below.

Project Management
The archaeological investigations that are to be
conducted as part of addressing the objectives of either
of these goals have to be part of a well-coordinated
management strategy. Ted Hollingsworth, Coastal
Resource Coordinator, will play a pivotal role in
providing the key historical memory and inventory of
all previous and future archaeological work to be
conducted within the boundaries of the park. He also
will play an important role in information flow and
coordination between the engineering firm hired to
carry out the objectives of the Master Plan and the
archaeological principal investigators hired to discover
prehistoric and historic properties and assess their State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) and National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility.

Another aspect of management strategy that will be
critical, given the breadth of park development and
potential impacts, is the use of a single, or few,
archaeological principal investigator(s) to conduct
monitoring, testing, and mitigation activities. To
successfully carry out the various archaeological tasks
associated with the development Master Plan, the
principal investigator (PI) will have to have a
comprehensive understanding of both prehistoric and
historic, and battle-related aspects of the cultural
resources throughout the entire park. While careful
oversight and management by the resource coordinator
can substitute for a single PI, the time needed by each
new PI to become familiar with the rich prehistory
and history of the park runs the risk of wasting time
relearning the background rather than dealing with the
resources immediately. Also, sharing of a long-term
memory of the projects conducted in the park, their
locations, results, etc. with the resource coordinator
can ensure that new projects can be articulated in a

It is suggested that comprehensive and up-to-date
records be kept of all subsurface disturbances that
require archaeological monitoring. The historical park
needs to compile at least one copy, or original, of all
records (reports, aerial photographs, historic maps,
slides, project photographs, profiles) hitherto produced
51

San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park

cost-effective manner with previous projects and
existing knowledge by choosing or suggesting
appropriate levels of effort.

of all events associated with the Battle of San Jacinto.
Accomplishing the first objective is critical because
it aids in the continued development of the park
facilities without endangering those properties that are
SAL or NRHP eligible. In addition, knowledge of the
full range of prehistoric and historic properties within
the park will allow a more complete understanding of
the character of land use along the Gulf Coastal Plain
and will contribute to a more balanced integration of
the history and prehistory of the region into the
interpretive framework of the park. The identification
of the location of all events associated with the battle
is obviously important in presenting an accurate
interpretation of the events. It is likely that, at least in
part, investigative strategies devised to accomplish one
of these objectives will also aid in reaching the other
objective. Therefore, although the two objectives are
somewhat different, and are discussed separately
below, it is important that both objectives be kept in
mind as investigations proceed within the park.

An additional aspect associated with the project
management strategy is to ensure that the engineering
firm in charge of carrying out the suggestions of the
Master Plan and the archaeological principal
investigator collaborate and coordinate very closely
during the entire length of the project. It is suggested
that during the development of the final and very
specific management plan for the historical park, the
PI, in collaboration with the engineering firm, develop
a comprehensive protocol document that identifies the
lines of communication and the levels of effort
(monitoring, testing, etc.) associated with different
types and degrees of subsurface disturbances across
the entire property. This document would be part of a
research design that outlines in very specific terms
the archaeological investigative methods and
techniques, and levels of effort that will be implemented
under each expected or planned development activity.
This document should accompany the permit
application.

The Range of Sites Expected
Taking the previous culture historical summary as a
backdrop, and combining it with the previously
recorded archaeological sites within the region, it is
clear that archaeological components representing the
Paleoindian period are rare. Often, artifacts of this time
period consist of isolated specimens that may represent
artifacts brought on shore by wave action or dredging.
Such artifacts will have minimal research value beyond
the documentation of variability in projectile point
types. However, it is also worth considering the
possibility that such artifacts were simply lost during
hunting forays along the banks of steams. Often, these
isolated finds consist of projectile points, a fact that
aids in their relative dating. At least in some cases, a
close scrutiny of the degree of roundedness of flake
scar ridges on both faces of an artifact may be
sufficient to distinguish artifacts that have been subject
to wave action as opposed to those that represent
terrestrial hunting losses. Individual artifacts that may
have been dredged from submerged terrace deposits
and are subsequently redeposited along the shoreline
may be very difficult to distinguish from those
originally deposited on the shore. In such cases, the

Finally, depending on planning and design schedules,
archaeological activities carried out within the park
could occur either independently of construction
activities or as carefully orchestrated investigative
efforts that are intended to clear areas for later
disturbance. The first of these two options is preferred
because it provides ample time for unexpected
discoveries and their careful and complete
documentation. The second strategy may also be
feasible given sufficient time to allow the thorough
investigation of areas of the park scheduled for
disturbance.

Site Discovery
As mentioned above, the search for archaeological
properties at the San Jacinto Battleground State
Historical Park can be seen as driven by two main
objectives: 1) to identify all prehistoric and historic
properties within the park; and, 2) identify the location
52

San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park

Chapter 8: Summary and Recommendations

recovery context (i.e., type of matrix, associated
artifacts) may aid in accurately identifying the postdepositional history of the materials.

Given that the crescent shaped levee along the southern
descending bank of Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto
River was a high point on the landscape providing
dry ground and an ideal lookout, it would have made
a desirable setting for prehistoric sites similar to the
shell concentrations noted immediately east of the
Mexican encampment (see Figure 3). It is possible
that at least the portion of the levee that was below
(east of) the confluence of the bayou and the San
Jacinto River would have been sufficiently low-lying
to have been seasonally flooded, perhaps only allowing
very short-term, temporary occupations by prehistoric
groups. Similarly, as it is shown by the locations of
41HR315, 41HR415, 41HR416, and 41HR488, and
shell concentrations identified by Weed and Miller
(1994), the wooded high bluff overlooking the tidal
marsh also would have been a favored locality for
extended seasonal camping that would have allowed
groups to take advantage of marshy as well as riverine
resources. Few prehistoric sites would be expected
within the marsh proper, although the area may have
been used as a resource procurement locality
throughout prehistory and some high spots within it
may have been used as staging areas for very brief
resource procurement forays or processing stations.
Figure 14 (in pocket folder in back) provides a
depiction of the high and moderate prehistoric site
potential across the historical park. In general, all
raised landforms within the project area that overlook
tidal marshes, the bayou, the river channel, and/or
small inlets are considered as having either moderate
or high prehistoric site potential.

It is also likely that the entire are may have been
submerged during the late Pleistocene and therefore
may not have been available for occupation.
Geomorphological research should verify this
possibility.
Early and Middle Archaic components should be
present within the park, as demonstrated by the 20
Early Archaic and 24 Middle Archaic components
discussed by Weed and Miller (1994). At least to date,
these components tend to be of relatively low
archaeological visibility (i.e., sand middens). Shell
middens that first appear during the Middle Archaic
have higher archaeological visibility and it is not
surprising that shell midden sites are the most
representative site type of the Late PrehistoricWoodland period. A total of 101 Early Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric components have been identified by Weed
and Miller in the general project area. While less
visible and less common, the paucity of early
components also means that any archaeological
components that predate the Late Prehistoric period
should be regarded with great interest because of the
scientific contribution they can make to regional
archaeology.

High, Moderate, and Low Site Probability Areas
The previous archaeological research within the
project area and the surrounding region provides us a
rough estimate of the likelihood of encountering
Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric components
within the historical park. An additional aspect of the
record is that it also informs us about the possible
location or spatial distribution of the prehistoric and
historic occupations or sites. That is, the existing
record allows us to identify high, moderate, and low
probability areas for site locations across the historical
park. The stratification of the park in terms of site
probability can in turn be used by park managers and
archaeologists to design flexible and appropriate site
discovery techniques and efforts.

Compared to the prehistoric land use, the character
and nature of the historic land use of the project area
is quite distinctive indicating a lesser dependence on
wild edible resources and a more direct tie to regional
economic networks and forces (i.e., the shipyards, the
sawmill, the town of San Jacinto). The archaeological
indicators of the economic factors influencing and
fueling the settlement and development of the project
area are reasonably well documented (i.e., the town
site of San Jacinto, the shipyards, the sawmill). On
the other hand, however, the archaeological correlates
and visibility of the earliest settlers of the project area
53

San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park

Chapter 8: Summary and Recommendations

(i.e., J. Conrad, R. Habermehl, freeman Wilkinson) is
less well-defined and even less well-documented.
Although early historic inhabitants of the area may
have been drawn to the shoreline, the division of the
land into tracts (Figure 6) all but ensures that isolated
historic homesteads may be found anywhere within
the project area (c.f. the Habermehl cemetery). With
this in mind, it is suggested that systematic archival
research be conducted (i.e., historic maps and
photographs, aerial photos) to identify the location of
the homesteads of the earliest settlers into the area. If
successful, these homesteads could than be targeted
for archaeological research to learn more about the
founders and movers and shakers within the region.
Additional archival research should be conducted to
develop a comprehensive history of the town of San
Jacinto. Archaeological research on historic properties
also should target remnants of the community to
document community formation processes, economic
relationships and trade within newly formed and
developing communities. Although the historic
properties that can be most directly and clearly targeted
are the town of San Jacinto and the homesteads
of the first settlers, given that little is known of the
latter, the entire project area can be considered as
having high historic site probability, but also
recognizing that individual historic properties will
have a localized nature.

been inaccurate, one would have to begin with the
assumption that entire area of the historical park may
hold high potential for finding battle-related artifacts.
Identifying material correlates of the battle across the
project area is probably one of the greatest challenges
facing archaeologists. While temporary camps, such
as those established by the two armies, are expected
to leave few archaeological indicators, it is possible
that at least the area of the battle (i.e., the area of
greatest loss of life) would have greater archaeological
visibility. An additional area that serves as an important
landmark in relation to the battle is the intersection of
the Harrisburg-Lynchburg and New Washington roads,
since the Texan camp was to have been located in its
vicinity. Although based on information from Ted
Hollingsworth, we assume that the unnamed roads on
the 1897 map in Hole (1972) represent this transportation artery, it is important that this assumption
be confirmed or tested through pedestrian survey
investigations, and/or remote sensing (i.e., soil
densitometer work or magnetometer survey).
Based on the existing archaeological record of the
region and the historical park, we can establish areas
of high, moderate, and low site potential, as we have
done above. However, the extensive anthropogenic and
natural forces that have impacted portions of the park
(see Chapter 7) need to be considered in evaluating
the actual, rather than ideal, archaeological potential
of the project area. For instance, one of the areas that
has seen relatively less impact to potential
archaeological resources is the area east-southeast of
the monument. Although a number of roads have been
constructed through this part of the park, the area
roughly including the Mexican camp and the principal
area of the battle is relatively less disturbed and can
be considered to have the best potential to yield intact
prehistoric and historic (i.e., battle-related) deposits.
Of course, within this area, all existing roads and
trenches should be considered highly disturbed areas
possessing low archaeological potential.

The final and most significant contribution of the
historical park is the Battle of San Jacinto. Although
we have mentioned that there is hardly consensus on
the location of the battle-related events, we can
reconstruct three areas within the park that may have
played a significant role in the battle and therefore
may be considered as having high battle-related site
potential: the Texan camp, the Mexican camp, and the
ravine where many of the Mexican soldiers lost their
lives. Figure 5 shows the suggested location of the
Texan camp, the location of the Mexican camp, and
the area of greatest loss of life (i.e., labeled as area of
battle). The area in between the two camps also was
involved in the battle and probably holds moderate to
low research potential as it relates to the San Jacinto
battle. On the other hand, if we were to assume
that all reconstructions of the battle layout have

Portions of the area west of Battlefield Road have been
tested rather extensively and have been shown to be
significantly altered by thick deposits of spoil, grading
and landscaping, installation of pipelines, and several
54

Chapter 8: Summary and Recommendations

construction episodes. The artifacts recovered have
been imbedded in the fill deposits and none were in
situ. In general, the entire area has been impacted to a
minimum depth of 5060 cm below the present grade
level. However, it is possible that the supposed area
of the Texan camp may have been less severely
impacted (i.e., a thinner layer of spoil) and that
stripping of the spoil near to the original 1836 surface
may allow hand-excavated units to expose minimally
disturbed camp layout data and period military
artifacts. It is important to remember, however,
that the remaining artifact assemblage may be
heavily biased and incomplete due to decades of
souvenir hunting.

destruction of most previously identified prehistoric
sites. Although recent efforts have slowed the rate of
subsidence, the effects are still appreciable over the
entire zone. For these reasons the likelihood of the
recovery, or discovery, of further prehistoric sites
would appear to be remote. Specifically, the
destruction by dredging, subsidence, and spoil
deposition appears to greatly reduce any possibility
of the recovery of evidence of the previous existence
of the town site of San Jacinto. The portion that might
remain is not likely to produce significant information
on the nature of the occupation and appears to be
deeply buried and capped by more recent fill, making
site interpretation extremely difficult.

The central area of the battlefield has been
significantly altered by the construction of the
monument, reflection pool, and the various road and
landscaping projects. Although isolated areas of
undisturbed parkland probably exist, the area has
suffered greatly from park development activities, as
well as from surface artifact collecting. While remotesensing investigations might prove effective in some
areas, especially those beyond the southern area
affected by the intensive landscaping near the
monument, investigations would still be hampered by
recently introduced artifacts and difficult soil
conditions. The probability of intact archaeological
deposits would appear to be moderate, at best, but
should be considered in any future development plans.

A similar conclusion can be reached regarding the high
prehistoric site probability area facing the San Jacinto
River channel along the northeast edge of the
landform. Although this area may have contained
seasonally occupied resource procurement sites and
short term camps, the extensive disturbances caused
by dredging and spoil deposition have likely destroyed
any intact deposits found in the area. However, a
portion of the area of greatest loss of life on the part
of the Mexican soldiers may lie buried or inundated
beneath the present surface in the area of the ravine
near Peggy Lake. Although the repeated deposition of
spoil in the area, as well as disturbances associated
with retaining wall construction, may have impacted
the integrity of the deposits, the waterlogged deposits
may actually have helped preserve organic remains.
Therefore, if in the future modification or alteration
of the area is considered, the possibility of exposure
of evidence of the battle, either artifacts or human
remains, must be evaluated. Unfortunately, remote
sensing methods of investigation (i.e., ground
penetrating radar, magnetometer work) will be difficult
due to the possible overburden and introduction of
recent artifacts into the area as a result of the dredging
and spoil deposition.

In general, one area that can be considered to have
low site probability potential is the tidal marsh and
the area north of the battleship Texas. As indicated in
the historic record and a study of the photographic
record over the past century, the cultural impact upon
the area has been extensive as a result of industrial
activities, dredging, and natural processes. The
dredging, which began as early as 1870 and intensified
after the period of the post-1930s, has resulted in a
thick deposit of spoil overlaying any prehistoric or
historic remains. In addition, dredging also likely
relocated artifacts of various periods throughout the
area. Land subsidence and erosion have created
significant alteration of the entire zone. These two
factors combined have resulted in partial or complete

Methods of Site Discovery
As indicated in the review of previous archaeological
investigations within the park and its vicinity, a number
of prehistoric and historic archaeological sites have
55

Chapter 8: Summary and Recommendations

been identified and documented within the project area
since the 1950s. A large portion of the historical park
has been surveyed through the years, nonetheless,
hitherto unsurveyed areas remain. It is necessary to
identify all unsurveyed areas of the park and conduct
pedestrian surveys of all previously unsurveyed tracts.

restore the integrity of the landform through the
removal of spoil from areas where it otherwise would
alter the visual integrity of the property while at the
same time it would remove large volumes of
overburden and permit hand excavation of selected
portions of the moderate probability areas (i.e., the
Texan camp). A less intrusive method to define the
depth of spoil deposits, as mentioned previously,
would be to systematically core areas suspected to be
covered by dredge spoil. This method would be more
favorable since it would minimize highly intrusive land
disturbance.

The pedestrian surveys should not concentrate only
on identifying surface or shallowly buried deposits
such as those commonly discovered through shovel
testing. Rather, because much of the original ground
surfaces that were occupied and utilized during
prehistoric and historic times may be covered by thick
layers of spoil, new surveys of previously unsurveyed
areas of the park should first concentrate on defining
the depth of spoil across the area and the location of
potentially deeply buried archaeological remains, both
historic and prehistoric. Secondly, previously surveyed
areas of the park that are documented to have thick
layers of spoil on top of the original ground surface
(i.e., south and west of the Reflection Pool), should
be resurveyed using site discovery methods that allow
for the discovery of deeply buried sites. To this end, it
is suggested that systematic deep coring be adopted
as a standard site discovery strategy in areas of the
park that have or are suspected to have thick blankets
of spoil. On large previously unsurveyed and even
previously surveyed areas such coring should be
conducted using mechanical coring machines (i.e.,
tractor driven augers). This approach will allow the
rapid excavation of large numbers of holes yet the
inspection of the matrix coming out of each hole will
allow observations on the nature of the soils and
presence/absence of cultural materials such as
debitage, burned mussel shells, etc.

The area southwest of Park Road 1836 is the one
portion of the project area that has seen the least
anthropogenic and natural impact. A possible approach
to investigating the historic research potential of this
area might be the use of an area grid surveyed by metal
detectors. This method could prove effective in this
portion of the park where the metallic spoil has not
been deposited. The method has proven to be quite
effective in similar situations such as Palo Alto
Battlefield National Historic Park and the Custer site
of Little Big Horn (Haeker and Mauck 1997; Scott et
al. 1989).
It is well-recognized and acknowledged that souvenir
hunting and surface collecting have taken place at the
San Jacinto site since shortly after the battlewith
metal detectors being used by amateurs most
recentlyand these events have undoubtedly taken
their toll on the artifacts. Systematic surveys and a
variety of site discovery methods used in combination
(i.e., magnetometer surveys, soil resistivity, ground
penetrating radar, backhoe trenching, shovel testing)
can be extremely effective under the proper conditions.
Another approach that has proven effective at recent
excavations at Fort St. Louis and Fort Anahuac is the
use of a cesium magnetometer. With good equipment
and well-trained operators, this method may prove
effective, especially in the location of larger surface
disturbing anomalies (Jim Bruseth, personal
communication 2001) such as the reported burial
trenches of the Mexican dead (see Chapter 6). To the
south of the monument in the reported area of the
Mexican camp and the site of the greatest loss of life,

Given the large scale of land surface modifications
resulting from dredging, another mechanized approach
to defining the depth of spoil in areas of the park is to
employ bulldozers and backhoes. Backhoes would be
employed to excavate a series of parallel trenches
across a large area with assumed spoil deposits. Once
the original least disturbed geomorphic zone is
identified, bulldozers could be used to scrape away
all intervening spoil down to within 1020 cm of
the original ground surface. This operation would help
56

Chapter 8: Summary and Recommendations

the land surface has been greatly altered by subsidence.
Here, the burial of artifacts could prove to have
preserved evidence of the battle. Therefore, we
recommend that this area be considered as culturally
sensitive and any activities with a negative impact
should be avoided here.

location of these aspects of the battle within the
historical park for signage and interpretive accuracy.
The second challenge is the discovery and documentation of prehistoric and historic properties not
associated with the San Jacinto battle. These activities
need to be carried out to manage the planned development activities associated with the historical park
without damage to cultural resources and in order to
reconstruct the natural setting to that which was
present at the time of the Battle of San Jacinto.

An additional aspect of site discovery is the relocation
of all previously discovered and still accessible
archaeological sites. The location of these sites should
be mapped using Global Positioning System
equipment. Given the highly dynamic geomorphological setting of the project area, site relocations
should be conducted with the reevaluation of site
eligibility in mind.

The cultural resources within the park and in its
immediate vicinity have been severely impacted by
anthropogenic (i.e., dredging and spoil discard) and
natural forces (i.e., erosion and subsidence). These
impacts provide a serious challenge to the location
and identification of prehistoric and historic properties
across the project area. The goal of archaeological
work is to discover as many prehistoric and historic
sites in the project area as possible, and to use this
data to enrich the interpretive framework of the park.
Thus allowing careful managed development of new
facilities and extension of old ones without damage
to SAL sites and properties eligible for listing to the
NRHP. It is expected that the bulk of the prehistoric
components in the project area will be Late Archaic,
Late Prehistoric and Woodland in age. The majority
of the sites will tend to be short-term seasonally
occupied sites. Those sites with shell middens and/or
shell lenses will tend to have higher archaeological
visibility than sites lacking these characteristics.
Historic components and/or sites will tend to be
representative of the early settlement of the region and
the founding of the town of San Jacinto.

Summary and Conclusions
The San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park is
one of the TPWD properties with the greatest
interpretive potential in the state. Within its boundaries
are a number of prehistoric properties that have the
potential to contribute significantly to our knowledge
of the prehistory of the Gulf Coastal Plains. In addition,
the park also contains the site of one of the most
important military accomplishments in the history of
the western hemisphere.
The goals of this report were three fold: 1) to construct
a comprehensive history of the Battle of San Jacinto;
2) to identify and describe the type of prehistoric sites
that might be located within the park; and 3) to find
and document any other historic period resources that
might be located below grade in the park. It was also
agreed that based on these findings a management plan
for the discovery of prehistoric and historic properties
would also be provided, complete with detailed site
discovery methodologies.

Archaeological efforts related to the identification of
the locations of the activities associated with the Battle
of San Jacinto need to focus on testing the high and
medium probability areas identified in this report (i.e.,
the Texan camp, the Mexican camp, and the area of
greatest loss of life). Keeping in mind that much of
the reconstruction proposed here is based on the
location of the Harrisburg-Lynchburg and New
Washington road locations, the suggested locations
described and mapped herein needs to be verified on
the ground.

Using archival records and first-hand accounts of the
battle, is has been possible to tentatively reconstruct
the locations of a number of key activities associated
with the battle (i.e., the Texan camp, the Mexican
camp, the area of greatest loss of life). The first
archaeological challenge is to actually identify the
57

Chapter 8: Summary and Recommendations

II. Site Discovery

The systematic use of mechanical coring of large
previously surveyed and unsurveyed portions of the
project area to discover archaeological components
buried below 16 feet of spoil is one strategy that
should be pursued systematically and should yield
positive results. This strategy can also be used to
produce a comprehensive and reasonably precise map
of the thicknesses of spoil across the park. The use of
heavy machinery (i.e., backhoes) to remove spoil down
to the vicinity of the original ground surface may be
employed as a cost-saving measure prior to hand
excavation of test units or shovel tests. It is suggested
that all previously recommended and still accessible
sites be revisited to establish the rate of site destruction
and their SAL/NRHP eligibility status reevaluated.

Main Goals
1) Identify all prehistoric and historic properties; and,
2) Identify the location of all events associated with
the Battle of San Jacinto.

Specific Recommendations
1) Hire geomorphologist to assess landscape changes
and their impact on shorelines and archaeological resources;
2) Identify depth of dredge spoil across the project
area;

The following outline summarizes the recommendations of this document. The recommendations are
organized in chronological order:

3) Target, for prehistoric investigations, the high bluff
areas overlooking the tidal marsh; and,

I. Project Management

4) Target, for historic investigations, the Texan campground, the Mexican campground, the area of
greatest loss of life, the old San Jacinto community, and potential homestead sites of the first
settlers.

1) Close coordination with the Coastal Resource
Coordinator;
2) Inventory of all previously recorded archaeological resources on property;

Methods of Site Discovery
1) Systematic coring across the project area;

3) Engineering firm should hire a single cultural
resource Principal Investigator;

2) Systematic survey with shovel testing in areas not
covered by dredge spoil;

4) Comprehensive record of all previous ground
disturbances on property;

3) Use of heavy machinery where spoil is thick, to
allow cost-effective site discovery;

5) Comprehensive record of all archaeological
reports and materials generated;

4) Identify all roads (i.e., Harrisburg-Lynchburg and
New Washington roads) using magnetometer, soil
resistivity and other remote sensing techniques;
and,

6) Generate a comprehensive map of all disturbances;
and,
7) Specific management plan needs to be tailored,
taking into account all existing cultural resources
and potential high and moderate probability areas.

5) Map all previous and newly discovered archaeological resources using Global Positioning System
equipment.

Chapter 8: Summary and Recommendations

The discovery of new prehistoric and historic sites
will enhance and broaden the interpretive framework
of cultural properties within the park. In addition, the
landscape-scale changes necessary to recreate the
visual accuracy of the natural setting of the San Jacinto
battle will greatly enhance aspects of battle-related
interpretation and add depth to the experience of
visiting the site. The successful development of the
goals and objectives of the Master Plan depends to a
large extent on systematic efforts expanded to find
prehistoric and historic properties within the park and
the accurate location of activities associated with the
Battle of San Jacinto.
