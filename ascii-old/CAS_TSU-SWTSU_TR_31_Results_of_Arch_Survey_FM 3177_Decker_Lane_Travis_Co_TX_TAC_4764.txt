Abstract
On March 13, 2008, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State UniversitySan Marcos conducted an intensive pedestrian survey and site reassessment funded by the Manor
Independent School District. The work was required to determine the effects of a proposed widening
of Decker Lane to include a center turn lane on the historic Decker Cemetery and on historic site
41TV1818, the former location of the Decker School. The project area is located completely within
the existing right-of-way of FM 3177 in northeastern Travis County, Texas. The development of this
land, which is owned by the State of Texas, requires archaeological survey in compliance with the
Texas Antiquities Code and under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Work was
carried out by Jon C. Lohse, Principal Investigator, and CAS archaeologists, David M. Yelacic, Project
Archaeologist, and R. Zac Selden under the Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4764.
The project consisted of two components: intensive pedestrian survey/site reassessment and
the investigation of a cemetery’s eastern boundary. Six shovel tests were excavated during the site
reassessment, only one of which yielded any cultural materials. No cultural material was observed on
the surface, and the single, ambiguous artifact recovered was out of geologic context. The cemetery
boundary was assessed by mechanical scraping of the ground surface to expose any possible unmarked
grave shafts that might lie in the project area. This work showed no evidence of unmarked burials outside
the clearly marked limits of the cemetery. Based on these results, CAS concludes that the project area
does not contain cultural properties or resources considered significant to the city, state, or nation’s
history. It is recommended that permission be granted to proceed with the proposed development.

Introduction

containing a historic site, 41TV1818. The other
section of FM 3177 that is scheduled for widening,
between Canoga Avenue and FM 969 (CSJ number
3277-01-017), was identified as a candidate for
no survey, meaning that no archaeological work
was necessary. This assessment was based on
the upland nature of this setting, the fact that no
previously recorded sites are located within the
existing ROW, and the heavy amount of impacts
caused by the original construction of FM 3177.
For both sections of the APE, the construction of
a center turn lane would affect deposits no more
than approximately 1.5-feet below the surface.
Hereafter, this report only describes the portion
of the project area where archaeological work
was carried out.

This report presents the results of an intensive
archaeological survey and site reassessment,
performed by the Center for Archaeological
Studies (CAS) at Texas State University-San
Marcos, in conjunction with a roadway widening
project along FM 3177 in northeastern Travis
County, Texas. This stretch of FM 3177, also
known as Decker Lane, will be widened to
include a center turn lane; an existing right-ofway (ROW) will provide the space necessary for
this expansion, and no new land will be acquired
for or impacted by this project.
Two separate sections of FM 3177 compose
the Area of Potential Effects (APE) (Figure 1).
However, archaeological investigations were
limited to just one section, between Daffan
Road and Larical Trail (CSJ number 3277-01016), measuring 0.482-acre (300-by-70 feet) and

An archaeological survey had been previously
conducted in the project area (Prikryl et al. 1997).
This survey was conducted in conjunction with
the development of the Oak Lane community,

Prikryl et al. (1997) recorded site 41TV1818, the
location of the former Decker School; its location
is marked as being within the proposed APE. In
the report produced from this survey, Prikryl et
al. (1997:29) concluded that “the site does not
appear to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
based on archeological or architectural values.”
However, the only record of this survey or its
findings that were available to CAS prior to the
field work was the location of 41TV1818 on the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Database. An
exhaustive search of the site files and library
of cultural resource management reports at the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) failed to
locate the report or any record of its findings
or recommendations. Accordingly, the site
reassessment was deemed necessary before the
proposed development could commence.

inclusion in the NRHP are present in an area
affected by federal agency actions, or by any
actions funded or permitted by federal agencies.
The federal regulatory process is described in
detail in the ACHP regulation 36 CFR 800.
Protection of cultural resources under
federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP,
which depends on site significance as defined by
National Park Service (NPS) rule 36 CFR Part
60. Four criteria are applied to archaeological
sites in determining their significance. These
address properties that are:
(A) associated with events that have made a
significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(B) that are associated with the lives of
persons significant in our past; or

This work was conducted entirely within the
existing ROW. This land is owned by the State of
Texas, and is administered by the Austin District
by the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT). The current project is funded by the
Manor Independent School District (MISD). As
such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of
the Texas Antiquities Code. All archaeological
work was performed under auspices of Texas
Antiquities Permit # 4764, granted to Jon C.
Lohse of CAS.

(C) that embody the distinctive characteristics
of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess
high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
(D) that have yielded, or may be likely to
yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

Archaeological sites identified as significant
cultural resources may be protected by federal law,
primarily by the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, which is invoked when
federal funds are utilized or when federal
permitting is required for a proposed project. The
NHPA created the National Register for Historic
Places (NRHP), and states that the Advisory
Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP) must
be afforded the opportunity to comment when
any cultural resources potentially eligible for

Cultural resources located on land owned or
controlled by the State of Texas or its political
subdivisions are protected by the Texas Antiquities
Code (Code) (Texas Natural Resources Code, Title
9, Chapter 191), which identifies significant sites
as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). Should
any historic or prehistoric sites located on land
that is designated for impact during development
be determined eligible for formal designation of
landmark status under the Code, some measure
of protection or mitigation of impact may be

necessary. The formal designation of SALs and
their administration is the responsibility of the
THC.

(E) the site offers a unique or rare
opportunity to test techniques, theory, or method
of preservation, thereby contributing to scientific
knowledge.

The Code generally requires that a complete
archaeological survey be undertaken in
conjunction with projects which fall under its
purview, particularly in previously unsurveyed
areas and in regions where cultural resources
are expected. Any resources determined to be
significant must then be avoided, protected, or
their destruction mitigated by approved data
recovery programs.

Archaeological investigations for this project
were designed to discover, evaluate, and reassess
any and all potentially significant cultural
resources located within the project area. The
work consisted of a literature review and site file
search for previously recorded sites in and around
the project area, an intensive pedestrian survey
with subsurface testing, and mechanical scraping.
All of these investigations were conducted in
accordance with the standards of the THC and
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). On the
basis of this work, recommendations will be
made regarding the eligibility for the portions
of 41TV1818 that might be present in the APE
for inclusion in the NRHP and regarding their
worthiness for designation as State Archaeological
Landmarks (SAL).

Worthiness for designation as a SAL is
defined in the Code:
Archeological sites may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as
State Archeological Landmarks, provided that
at least one of the following conditions is met
(Rules and Practice, Chapter 41:10):
The archeological site is situated on land
owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one
of its political subdivisions; [and then]

Under Short Report Format guidelines set
forth by CTA and adopted by the THC, this
report defines the project area setting, provides a
cultural background, describes the methods used
in gathering information, presents the results
of the survey and site reassessment, and offers
recommendations on the further development
of this land. This survey was performed by the
Principal Investigator, Jon C. Lohse, and CAS
archaeologists, David Yelacic and R. Zac Selden,
on March 13, 2008.

are less likely to contain intact archaeological
deposits in primary context.

Vegetation
The APE currently lacks any naturally
existing trees or shrubs and has a maintained
surface with an overall ground visibility of about
5 percent due to grass (Figure 3). Without the
historic and modern disturbances compromising
the natural vegetation, there would most likely be
scattered hardwoods with undergrowth of shrubs
and mid to tall grass (Werchan et al 1974).

Soils
Soils found in the project area, as described
by Werchen et al. (1974), include three different
series and complexes: Ferris-Heiden complex
(FhF3), Houston Black gravelly clay (HoD2),
and Houston black clays (HnB). These three soil
types are listed in order of the slopes on which
they found, from most to least severe. FerrisHeiden soils occupy slopes ranging from 8 to 20
percent, Houston Black gravelly clays are found
on 2 to 8 percent slopes, and Houston Black clays
are present on slopes of 1 to 3 percent. FerrisHeiden clays are often deep, extending as much
as 60 inches (152 cm) in places. Houston Black
clays (including Houston Black gravelly clay)
can be even deeper, reaching over 100 inches
(254 cm). Soil erosion and colluvial movement
increase with slope, and areas of greater incline

Economy
Primary economic activities currently in
the vicinity include industrial, commercial,
and residential developments. The Long Power
Station, the Decker United Methodist Church,
Decker Elementary School, and several housing
and business complexes are located adjacent
to the project area. The Long Power Station is
cooled by Lake Walter E. Long, also known as
Decker Lake, which is less than
a kilometer to the east of the
project area and was created
in the 1960s by the damming
of Decker Creek, a seasonal
tributary of the Colorado River.

Central Texas
Cultural Chronology

?

The cultural chronologies for
Central and South Texas are not
completely understood or agreed
upon. However, archaeological
deposits indicate rich cultural
development. Black (1995),
Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins
(1995, 2004) present the most
recent syntheses of the available
chronological
evidence
of

1,200 BP, and is generally seen as
a time during which humans made
successful adaptations to changing
environmental conditions. The
Late Prehistoric stage begins ca.
1,200 BP and is characterized by a
resurgence of grassland habitats and
the development of bow and arrow
and ceramic technologies.

Paleoindian
According to Hester (1995:433–
436, 2004), the Paleoindian stage
occurred between 11,200–7,950 BP
in South Texas. However, Collins
(1995:381–385, 2004) dates it to
11,500–8,800 BP in Central Texas,
though he excludes the final Late
Paleoindian interval known as
Angostura. Diagnostic artifacts
observed from this stage are
associated with the Clovis, Folsom,
and a variety of later Paleoindian
cultures (Bousman et al. 2004). The
Early Paleoindian stage, consisting

cultures that relied heavily on
archaeological culture history in the region. The
hunting large game animals such as
following cultural chronology is based on Black
mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel, and horse
(1995), Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins (1995,
(Black 1989). Recent in-depth research has shown
2004). All dates are in the radiocarbon time scale
that Paleoindian peoples, especially during the
and given as years before present (BP, i.e. before
Late Paleoindian substage, also utilized a wide

badgers, mice, alligators, turtles, and tortoises
(Black 1989; Bousman et al. 2004; Collins and
Prehistoric
Brown 2000; Hester 1983).
Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric
are the three major stages identified in the
Prehistoric period. The Paleoindian stage is
characterized by the earliest human occupation
of North America prior to 8,000 BP. The Archaic
stage follows, extending from ca. 8,000 BP to

A large distribution of Clovis points across
North and Central America suggests a wide
dispersal of their makers (Wenke 1990:201).
Meltzer and Bever (1995) documented the
presence of 406 Clovis points at 128 of the 254
?

Archaic

counties in Texas. These points are lanceolate
in shape, with a thinned base resulting from
“fluting,” or the removal of one or more channel
flakes, and are often found in association with
remains of mammoth, mastodon, horse, bison,
and sometimes camel. Clovis sites generally
include open camp sites, quarries, and caches,
but the Clovis kill sites are the best known.
Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture
are bifaces, prismatic blades and blade cores,
engraved stones, bone points, stone bolas, ochre,
and shaft straighteners.

Collins (1995, 2004) contends the Archaic
stage in Central Texas lasted approximately
7,500 years, from 8,800 to 1,200/1,300 BP, and
divides the stage into Early, Middle, and Late
Archaic. However, this places the Angostura
interval, often considered to be Late Paleoindian
by other archaeologists, in the Archaic stage.
Therefore, other archaeologists suggest that the
Archaic began at 8,000 BP. The Archaic stage
marks several important transitions: a shift from
large game hunting to hunting smaller animals;
the increased use of plant food resources and
use of ground stones in food processing; the
implementation of stone cooking technology;
increased use of organic materials for tool
manufacturing and an increase in the number
and variety of lithic tools for wood working;
the predominance of corner- and side-notch
projectile points; greater population stability and
less residential mobility; and systematic burial
of the dead. This stage is also distinguished by
environmental and climatic changes, in which
climates became wetter.

The occurrence of Clovis points is followed
by Folsom and Midland points, with Midland
overlapping with the presence of Folsom points
(Holliday 1997). Folsom points are fluted and
are found in association with ancient bison
remains, while Midland points are manufactured
through pressure collateral flaking, but lack
fluted channels. Very thin bifaces called ultrathin
bifaces are also found at some Folsom campsites
(Stanford and Broilo 1981). As most Pleistocene
fauna were extinct by this time, Folsom cultures
are considered to be specialized bison hunters.
Most Folsom sites occur as surface scatters,
although deeply buried deposits have been
uncovered. While no campsites or kill sites
from this period have been found south of Bexar
County, artifacts associated with this interval
are common throughout Texas (Bousman et al.
2004).

Early Archaic
Collins and Hester debate the time frame of
the Early Archaic stage in Central Texas. Hester
(1995:436–438, 2004) defines the Early Archaic
with Early Basal Notched and Early Corner
Notched dart points dating between 7,950 and
4,450 BP, while Collins (1995:383, 2004) argues
that the Early Archaic spans from 8,800 to
6,000 BP based on three divisions of projectile
point types. It is generally believed that at the
beginning of the Holocene, a change in climate
accompanied by the extinction of large herds
of megafauna stimulated a behavioral change
in the use of land by the hunters and gatherers
in South Texas (McKinney 1981). They focused
more intensively on the exploitation of local
resources such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs. This
dietary adjustment is evidenced by the increased

The Late Paleoindian substage is found from
10,000–8,000 BP. The most reliable evidence for
this date was recovered from the Wilson-Leonard
site, north of Austin (Bousman et al. 2004;
Collins 1998). At Wilson-Leonard, archaeologists
excavated an occupation known as Wilson,
which is defined by and named after the unique
stemmed projectile point. The dense occupation
also included a human burial (Bousman et al.
2004; Collins 1998).

number of ground stone artifacts, burned rock
midden cooking features, and more specialized
tools such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe
bifaces (Turner and Hester 1993:246–256). Early
Archaic sites are thinly dispersed and are seen
across a wide area of Texas and northern Mexico
(Weir 1976). The occupants of these territories
are believed to have lived in small bands of
related individuals (Story 1985:38).

interval was also a period when temperature and
aridity were at their greatest levels, and there is
evidence of increased utilization of xerophytes
such as sotol (Johnson and Goode 1994). These
plants were typically baked in earth ovens, and
the increased use of earth ovens is reflected in the
development of burned rock middens, which are
the remnants of ovens. During the drier episodes,
the aquifer-fed streams and resource-rich
environments of Central Texas were extensively
utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128).

Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic in Central Texas is dated
from 6,000 to 4,000 BP (Collins 1995, 2004).
Collins divides the Middle Archaic into three
projectile point style intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf
Creek; Taylor; and Nolan and Travis. The Middle
Archaic is demarcated from the Early Archaic
by the onset of the Altithermal, a climatic period
of warmer temperatures and increasing aridity.
The beginning of the Middle Archaic, the BellAndice-Calf Creek interval, was a mesic period
when grasslands expanded southwards into
Central and South Texas, followed by bison
herds from the Plains. Bell-Andice-Calf Creek
peoples were specialized bison hunters who
followed the herds southwards, bringing with
them a lithic tool kit specifically adapted to
killing and processing bison. These points were
extremely thin and broad, and made differently
from the proceeding Early Archaic points.
Andice points in particular have deeply notched
corner bases that create large, delicate, barbs.
As the Altithermal progressed, conditions in
South and Central Texas became warmer and
drier, and the bison and bison hunters retreated
northwards. During this period, Taylor bifaces
were manufactured, which are bifaces similar to
the earlier Bell-Andice-Calf Creek peoples, but
lack notching. By the latter part of the Middle
Archaic, Taylor bifaces were replaced by Nolan
and Travis points, which are technologically and
stylistically dissimilar to the two preceding style
intervals (Collins 1995, 2004). The Nolan-Travis

Late Archaic
The Late Archaic substage in Central Texas
dates from approximately 4,000 to 1,300/1,200
BP (Collins 1995:384, 2004). The herds of bison
began returning to the southern Great Plains,
again influencing the subsistence strategies of
the early Americans (Dillehay 1974). Many
researchers argue that populations continued to
grow, although this interpretation is somewhat
disputed (Prewitt 1985). Some archaeologists
note the presence of cemeteries at sites such
as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981) and Olmos Dam
(Lukowski 1988) as evidence that populations
indeed increased and that groups were becoming
territorial (Story 1985:44–45). Others challenge
the interpretation of population growth by citing
a decrease in burned rock middens (Prewitt
1981:80–81). Pottery, which often accompanies
increased sedentism, territoriality, and population
growth, began making an appearance in limited
areas of the South Texas Plains during the Late
Archaic (Story 1985). However, most regions
remained “pre-ceramic” for another thousand
years (Story 1985:45–47).

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Late Prehistoric
in Central Texas from 1,300/1,200 to 260 BP,
and divides it into the Austin and Toyah phases.
This stage is marked by the introduction of
new technologies. The most significant changes
?

include a technological shift away from the dart
and atlatl to the bow and arrow, the incorporation
of pottery in the central and northern parts of
the South Texas Plains (Black 1989:32; Story
1985:45–47), and the introduction of domesticated
plants such as corn and squash (Salcedo 1809).

Huebner 1991; Ricklis 1994). The Toyah is also
characterized by the appearance of bone-tempered
pottery in Central Texas (Johnson 1994:241–
281). The wide variety of ceramic styles and
influences seen throughout Toyah phase ceramic
assemblages provide important information on
the social composition of these cultural groups
(Arnn 2005). Toyah phase ceramic assemblages
display Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast, and Jornada
Mogollon influences (Arnn 2005). Johnson (1994)
contends that material remains dating from the
Toyah phase represent a single group sprawled
across the vast area of Texas. Ricklis (1994), on
the other hand, describes it more as a collection
of traits that moved through relatively stable
regional populations. Recently, Arnn (2005) has
speculated that variations in ceramic styles are
indicative of the movement of small groups of
people between established populations in the
various regions of Texas.

Austin Phase
The Austin phase is characterized by the
appearance of small arrow points, such as
Edwards and Scallorn types, which indicate
a shift from the use of atlatls to bows. Burned
rock middens are found in association with
these types of points (Houk and Lohse 1993).
Ground and pecked stone tools used for plant
food processing, which first appeared during the
Archaic, are more common in the Austin phase.
Burials from this time reveal a high proportion
of arrow-wound deaths (Meissner 1991, Prewitt
1974, Black 1989), suggesting that population
growth resulted in disputes over limited resource
availability.

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada
Period)

Toyah Phase

In Texas, the Protohistoric period, also known
as the Spanish Entrada period, was marked by
Spanish entradas, the formal expeditions from
established forts and missions in Northern Mexico
into Central, Coastal, and East Texas in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
These encounters began with the venture into
Texas by the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
and the Narvaez expedition in 1528. The period
is defined by Hester as “the transition period
between the Prehistoric and Historic period
denoting a phase for which few written records
are available, and for which most evidence is
derived from archaeology” (1995:449–450,
2004). It is generally dated between 1500 and
1700 (or 1528, the date of the Cabeza de Vaca/
Narvaez expedition, to the establishment of the
first Spanish mission, Mission San Antonio de
Valero in 1718).

The beginning of the Toyah phase (800
BP) in Central Texas is discernible by the
replacement of expanding stem projectile points
with contracting stem points and flaring, barbed
shouldered points. The Perdiz point is a classic
example of a contracting stem point (Black
1989:32; Huebner 1991:346). However, the use of
the Perdiz point as an indicator of the Toyah phase
is questionable, as they are often noted in much
later contexts, such as a glass example recovered
from an American Indian neophyte residential
context at the San Antonio de Valero mission
in San Antonio (Lohse 1999:268).This phase is
also characterized by the introduction of bladelet
technology that included prismatic blades, blade
cores, and scrapers-on-blades, considered to be

When the Spanish missions were established
in East Texas in the late 1600s, entradas began
to travel regularly through Central Texas. With
Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680, El Camino
Real (the King’s Road) was established from
Villa Santiago de la Monclova in Mexico to East
Texas. This roadway followed established Native
American trade routes and trails and became a
vital link between Mission San Juan Bautista in
Northern Mexico and the Spanish settlement of
Los Adaes in East Texas (McGraw et al. 1991).
Spanish priests accompanying entradas provided
the most complete information of indigenous
cultures of early Texas. The few remaining
Spanish accounts of the native groups in Texas
reveal a dynamic cultural environment where
numerous tribes passed through or inhabited
Central Texas at different periods. Little is
known about the majority of these tribes. Those
documented during the early entradas include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane,
who were settled around the springs at San
Marcos, approximately 40 miles south of the
current project area. They were described as small
bands that roamed between the rivers hunting
game and gathering wild plant foods. Other
tribes encountered in the region included mobile
hunting parties from villages in South and West
Texas, such as Catequeza, Cayanaaya, Chalome,
Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading for bison
hunting grounds in the Blackland Prairies (Foster
1995:265–289; Johnson and Campbell 1992;
Newcomb 1993). Later groups migrated into the
region and displaced the former groups or tribes.
These included the Tonkawa from Oklahoma and
Lipan and Comanche from the Plains (Campbell
and Campbell 1985; Dunn 1911; Newcomb 1961,
1993).

beads, and traditional Native American artifacts,
such as manufactured stone tools.

Historic
Spanish settlement in Central Texas first
occurred in San Antonio with the establishment
of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo)
in 1718, and the later founding of San Antonio
de Béxar (Bolton 1970; Habig 1977; de la Teja
1995). Some researchers demarcate the transition
in Texas between the Entrada (Protohistoric)
and Historic periods by the construction of the
first Spanish missions in Texas during the early
eighteenth century. The only other Spanish
settlement in the region was San Marcos de Neve,
established in 1808, four miles south of present
day San Marcos. San Marcos de Neve was
abandoned in 1812 as a result of constant raids
by local tribes (Dobie 1932). During this time,
massive depopulation occurred among the Native
Americans, mostly due to European diseases to
which the indigenous people had little resistance.
Mexico achieved independence from Spain in
1827, opening settlements in the region of what is
known today as South Texas. European presence
in the region increased as settlers received land
grants from the Mexican government until 1835.
Archival research by Prikryl et al. (1997)
provides information pertaining to the Swedish
settlement of eastern Travis County. Stephen F.
Austin’s Little Colony, which included Travis
County where the current project area is located,
was one of the initial settlements recognized
by the Mexican government (Barkley 1963;
cited in Prikryl et al. 1997). Early pioneers
of Travis County settled areas adjacent to the
Colorado River where the soils were suitable
for agriculture; these early immigrants were
mostly of English ancestry. After the Civil War,
immigrant groups of German and Swedish
descent settled eastern Travis County. Swedish
immigrants from the Barkeryd Parish in the

northern part of the Smaland province settled the
area adjacent to Decker Creek beginning in 1867
(Scott 1990; cited in Prikryl et al. 1997). Between
1870 and 1900, the Swedish population in Texas
grew dramatically. This growth reflected not
only immigration from Sweden, but migration
from Swedish settlements in north central United
States (Tyler 1996; cited in Prikryl et al. 1997).
As a result of this rapid growth, several small
rural communities, including Decker, were
established. In 1880 in the community of Decker,
John and Emma Johnson, Swedish settlers who
arrived in Texas in 1879, bought 149 acres of the
original James Burleson headright (Prikryl et al.
1997:7). Records suggest that the Decker School,
which was in operation between 1882 and 1943,
occupied three acres possibly donated by the
Johnsons (Prikryl et al. 1997). Another important
establishment in the community was the Decker
United Methodist Church, which was founded
sometime before 1900 and is still currently used.
The church has adjacent to its north a cemetery
where many early settlers of the community are
buried.

This site is believed to have been occupied
from the late nineteenth century until the 2007
survey. Three shovel tests were excavated by
PAI archaeologists within the site boundaries;
the results of these subsurface probes showed no
evidence of buried archaeological deposits.
41TV1818, the historic site that was
reassessed during the current project, was present
on the Site Atlas Database map, but absent in the
written record on file at the Texas Archaeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and in the Site
Database. Upon conclusion of the CAS fieldwork,
the Principal Investigator (Timothy Perttula)
of the firm that conducted those excavations,
Archeological and Environmental Consultants,
Inc., graciously provided a reproduced copy of
the report. The description of site 41TV1818 is
taken from that report.
In 1997 Archeological and Environmental
Consultants (AEC) performed archeological
and historical investigations for the Oak Lane
Community Development Project in northeastern
Travis County, Texas (Prikryl et al. 1997). This
investigation resulted in the identification and
assessment of four sites, including 41TV1818,
the former Decker School. AEC’s subsequent
report of these investigations also includes the
results from extensive archival research on this
settlement of Swedish immigrants, known as the
community of Decker.

Previous Archaeological
Investigations
A review of the THC Site Atlas Database
(Database) shows two earlier surveys in the
project area and two previously recorded sites
located within one kilometer of the project
area. Approximately 600 m west of the current
project area on Decker Lane is the historic site,
41TV2249, discovered and recorded by Prewitt and
Associates, Inc. (PAI) during an archaeological
survey in 2007 (Griffith and Katauskas 2007).
According to Griffith and Katauskas (2007), a
1937 aerial photograph of the area shows two
houses and multiple outbuildings, but during the
2007 field work only one house, one cistern, and
the remnants of outbuildings were still intact.

Though it may not have begun there, the
Decker School, which operated from 1882 to
1943 when it consolidated and formed the Manor
School District with other rural schools in the
area, was located 45 m to the northeast of the
cemetery beginning as late as 1895, as seen on
the 1896 Austin, Texas 15’ USGS topographic
quadrangle (Prikryl et al. 1997). In the early to
mid twentieth century, before the school closed at
this location, it had as many as three rooms with
10

three teachers who taught first through ninth
grades to no more than 99 students.

in order to delineate its boundaries. Each of these
components is described below.

When AEC discovered 41TV1818 in 1997, as
described by Prikryl et al. (1997) in their report
of the survey, there were just remnants of the
school building and its outbuildings. A concrete
sidewalk connected to a larger concrete pad with a
raised step represented the entrance to the school
building. Just to the southwest of that, there was
a concrete-coated brick cistern and two upright
concrete slabs representing the bases of water
fountains. 50 m north of the school building were
the remnants of a two-hole privy represented by
a scatter of bricks surrounding two holes lined
with concrete. Along with these structures, many
surface artifacts, including a whiteware ceramic
sherd, brick fragments, and glass shards, were
observed in the pedestrian survey. Four of the six
shovel tests at the site were positive, containing
more glass shards, wire nails, and carbon, which
supports the occupation of this land by the school
in the late nineteenth century.
One particular shard of glass,
recovered in shovel testing,
may have come from a pane
manufactured in the mid1870s and provides evidence
that the school may have
been at this location from
the time it began operating
in 1882.

Intensive Archaeological Survey and
Site Reassessment
In order to investigate and reassess the
portion of 41TV1818 that is in the current APE,
CAS archaeologists followed the guidelines
recommended by the THC and CTA for recording
and documenting newly reported archaeological
sites. Appropriately six shovel tests were
excavated just inside the publicly-owned ROW’s
western boundary, where 41TV1818 was believed
to intersect with the current APE (Figure 4).
Subsurface shovel test probes extended to
a maximum of 100 cmbs (centimeters below
surface) and were excavated in 20 cm arbitrary
levels. The purpose of these probes was to
locate any buried archaeological deposits that
might have been present but were not visible
from the surface. Any and all cultural materials

Research Design
and Methods
The field work consisted
of two components: an
intensive
archaeological
survey and site reassessment
for 41TV1818 and an
investigation of the cemetery

the reassessment of 41TV1818 and for the cemetery investigations.

recovered during the excavations were described,
documented, and then returned to the test pit at
the completion of the excavation. All shovel tests
were backfilled upon completion.

The front-end-loader of the backhoe was
used to remove between one and two feet (0.30
- 0.61 m) of top soil along the fence that forms the
current eastern boundary of the cemetery. This
trench was excavated approximately five to seven
meters from FM 3177 in the ROW (Figure 5). The
intention of this excavation was to locate unmarked
grave shafts; none were visible at this depth, but
two modern disturbances, possibly belonging to
buried cable or gas pipes, were observed running
parallel to the eastern edge of the trench. This
discovery provoked a modification in methods
requiring the use of the backhoe to complete the
excavation (Figure 6). From one to two more feet
were excavated (0.30 – 0.61 m), to a total depth of
up to approximately four feet (~1.22 m), along the

Cemetery Investigations
Research into the cemetery’s precise
boundaries and extent first involved coordination
with the Decker United Methodist Church.
This church is immediately to the southwest of
the cemetery on FM 3177 and is believed to be
associated with the adjacent cemetery.
The second stage of the cemetery boundary
investigation consisted of using a backhoe to
scrape a sufficient amount of sediment off of the
surface to expose unmarked burial
shafts outside of the currently fenced
boundary, which is immediately
to the west of the ROW. When the
mechanical scraping was completed,
the excavated sediment was returned
to the trench.

Results
Between
the
mechanical
scraping designed to delineate the
cemetery boundary and the intensive
archaeological survey directed
towards reassessing 41TV1818,
this 0.482-acre tract of land was
thoroughly investigated. These
results are described below.

Cemetery Boundary
After consulting with Pastor Jim
Sweet of Decker United Methodist
Church, with which the cemetery
is associated, it was deduced that
further investigation into the eastern
cemetery boundary was necessary.

cemetery fence. This second pass exposed a
slightly undulating gravelly deposit directly
overlying a gray clay into or through which grave
shafts would have been easily detectable, but no
disturbances were observed.

Elementary School. The area between the
driveways, approximately 30 m wide, had no
signs of a concrete sidewalk, a raised concrete
pad, a cistern, or upright concrete slabs visible
on the surface (see Figure 2). Instead, this ROW
area, as well as the portion north of the northern
driveway, had telephone poles, fire hydrants,
utility boxes, recently planted trees, and pin flags
marking buried cables and/or pipes. There was
also a significant portion of the ROW disturbed
in modern development for rainwater runoff and
flood control (Figure 7).

An absence of disturbances associated with
the cemetery throughout the trench resulted in
the termination of mechanical scraping at an
approximate depth of four feet (~1.22 m). Based
on the results of the mechanical scraping, CAS
concludes that the fence currently marking the
eastern edge of the cemetery appears to be a
precise indication of the extent of burials.

Six shovel tests were excavated to examine
the possibility that buried archaeological
deposits were still present. They were evenly
spaced, approximately 10 to 15 m apart, and
excavated along the edge of the ROW just west
of the drainage. Like the pedestrian survey, the
subsurface testing lacked artifacts and showed
evidence of modern disturbances with one
exception, Shovel Test 4.

41TV1818 Reassessment
As observed in the pedestrian survey,
no portion of the ROW appeared to have
been undisturbed by modern development.
Where the former Decker School once stood,
according to Prikryl et al. (1997), there were
two driveways providing access to the Decker
13

In the first level of Shovel Test 4, 0-20 cmbs, a
small fragment of a rusted metal can, one possibly
tested cobble that was not distinctly cultural,
and a small piece of carbon were observed. The
rusted metal can resembled a crushed 12 ounce
soft drink can, and is considered to be a piece of
relatively modern debris. This conclusion, along
with the mottled nature of the sediments in which
it and the possibly tested cobble were found,
provides evidence that the artifacts were not in
primary context. These items do not constitute
evidence of site 41TV1818.

moisture content that increased with depth. The
results from the six shovel tests, which can be
seen in Appendix A, suggested that, if it had
not already been disturbed past the point of
recognition, 41TV1818 was not in danger of being
effected by the proposed widening of FM 3177.

Recommendations
The background literature and site file
research, as well as the intensive pedestrian
survey and excavations of shovel tests, reveal
that no prehistoric or historic deposits are present
in the project area that could be construed as
potentially significant to the city or state’s history
under any criteria of the Texas Antiquities Code.
Accordingly, CAS concludes that no additional
archaeological investigations are necessary
and recommends that the Manor Independent
School District be granted regulatory clearance
to proceed with their plans to construct a center
turn lane on FM 3177.

From heavily mottled sediment to modern
debris, all six of the shovel tests showed
characteristics of disturbance. Scattered gravel
and cherty pebbles were common throughout
each of the test pits. All of the sediment excavated,
except for the sandy-clay loam in Shovel Test 1,
was clay rich loam of varying colors and mixtures.
The northern most shovel test, Shovel Test 6,
which was also down slope from the rest, had a
