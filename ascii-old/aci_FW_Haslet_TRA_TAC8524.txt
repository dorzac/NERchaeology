Abstract
On August 30, and September 4 through 6, 2018, aci consulting conducted a
cultural resources survey for the Fort Worth-Haslet-Trinity River Authority of
Texas (FW-HASLET-TRA) Sewer Project in Tarrant County, Texas. The Area of
Potential Effect (APE) for this project consists of the 50-foot Right-of-Way (ROW)
for the proposed 1.24-mile sewer line, for a total of 7.53 acres (3.05 hectares)
(Figures 1 and 2). The depth of impact is approximately 4 feet.
The project is the result of a three-way agreement between the City of Haslet, the
City of Fort Worth, and the Trinity River Authority and will be funded through
the City of Haslet, thus the project is conducted in compliance with the Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) as well as Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. The work was completed under
Texas Antiquities Code permit number 8524. The investigation consisted of an
intensive pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching. The
investigation did not result in the location of any new archeological sites, historic
structures, or additional historic properties. Based on these results, no further
archeological work is recommended. Records from this investigation will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Julie Shipp served as
Principal Investigator.

INTRODUCTION

On August 30, and September 4 through 6, 2018, aci consulting conducted a
cultural resources survey for the Fort Worth-Haslet-Trinity River Authority of
Texas (FW-HASLET-TRA) Sewer Project in Tarrant County, Texas. The Area of
Potential Effect (APE) for this project consists of the 50-foot Right-of-Way (ROW)
for the proposed 1.24-mile sewer line, for a total of 7.53 acres (3.05 hectares)
(Figures 1 and 2). The depth of impact is approximately 4 feet.
The project is the result of a three-way agreement between the City of Haslet, the
City of Fort Worth, and the Trinity River Authority and will be funded through
the City of Haslet, thus the project is conducted in compliance with the Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) as well as Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. The investigation will consist of
an intensive pedestrian survey, shovel testing, backhoe trenching, site recording,
assessment of sites for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), data analysis, and
reporting in accordance with THC and Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA)
standards.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

Physiography

The APE is located in central Texas within the Grand Prairie, which lies to the
west of the Blackland Prairie and includes the Western Cross Timbers (Wermund
1995). The Grand Prairie north and west of Fort Worth is characterized by a
plateaulike surface which is well exposed. Primarily sandstones underlie the
western margin of the Grand Prairie, where post oak woods form the Western
Cross Timbers. The elevation of the APE ranges from 690 feet above mean sea
level (MSL) near the northern terminus to 720 feet above MSL towards the
southern terminus.
2.2

Geology and Soils

The Bureau of Economic Geology classified the general surface geology of the
APE as being primarily dominated by the Fort Worth Limestone and Duck Creek
Formation, undivided (Kfd). This group is described by Barnes (1972) as: Fort
Worth Limestone, limestone and clay. Ls aphanitic to biosparite, burrowed;
marine megafossils are Pecten, oysters, echinoids, and ammonites. Clay,
calcareous, in units 0.1-5 feet thick, forms low rolling hills. Thickness 25-35 feet.
Duck Creek Ls., limestone and marl. ls med. bedded, nodular to wavy bedded;
thickness 25-30 feet.
The Pawpaw Formation, Weno Limestone, and Denton Clay, undivided (Kpd)
intersects the middle of the APE for less than 700 feet (less than 213 meters). This
Early Cretaceous formation is described by Barnes (1972) as: Pawpaw-calcareous marl, near middle soft ledge-forming limestone bed, unit as a whole
recessive; thickness as much as 10 feet, thins southward. Weno Limestone, some
very thin marl interbeds, thin to medium bedded, white to grayish yellow, basal
2- to 4-feet-thick resistant ledge forms uplands; thickness 6-45 feet. Denton clay
alternating clay, marl, and limestone. Thickness 6-25 feet thins southward.
Three soil series are mapped along the APE (Figure 3). The soils are mapped as
Frio silty clay, Sanger clay, and Slidell clay (NRCS 2018). While Sanger and
Slidell have been previously determined to have a low probability to contain
archeological sites according to the Potential Archeological Liability Maps

(PALM) model created by TxDOT ENV for highway projects in the Fort Worth
District, Frio soil series has been determined to have a very high probability
(Abbott 2013). Frio silty clay is mapped as 71.5% of the APE.
•

Frio silty clay, frequently flooded (27) - The Frio series consists of very deep,
well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous
loamy and clayey alluvium. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils
occur on flood plains.

•

Sanger clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (65) - The Sanger series consists of very
deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey
marine sediments. These gently sloping to strongly sloping soils are on
broad uplands.

•

Slidell clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (74) - The Sanger series consists of very
deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey
marine sediments. These gently sloping to strongly sloping soils are on
broad uplands.

According to the Fort Worth Hybrid District Potential Archeological Liability
Map (HPALM), the majority of the APE has very high potential for cultural
resources (Figure 4) (Abbott 2011).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A literature review of the THC Archeological Sites Database (the Atlas) revealed
that no previously recorded sites are within the APE nor within 1 kilometer of
the APE (Figure 5). Furthermore, only one previously conducted survey
intersects the APE. The survey was conducted in 2009 by URS for the City of Fort
Worth and the Federal Aviation Administration for the Realignment of BNSF
Railway and John Day Road, Alliance Airport Expansion Project (Turner-Pearson
et al 2009). The survey only crosses the proposed APE for 36 meters (118 feet)
parallel to the BNSF Railway. No cemeteries or historical markers are within the
APE or 1 kilometer of the APE.

METHODS

4.1

Survey Method

An intensive pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted along the entire 1.24mile (2-kilometer) alignment to locate any archeological sites or other historical
properties that may be within the APE (see Figures 1 and 2). The majority of the
proposed project lies within high probability area in Frio soils, which are likely to
contain deeply buried archeological sites. Therefore, backhoe trenches were
excavated along the stream in approximately 100 meter-intervals, in accessible
areas with Frio soil. Ten backhoe trenches (BHT) were excavated along the
unnamed tributaries to Henrietta Creek, supplemented by three shovel tests
(Figure 6).
The backhoe trenches were approximately 15 feet (4.5 meters) long, 3 feet (1
meter) wide, and 5 feet (1.5 meters) deep. The trench walls were examined for
the presence of cultural material, and a one-meter section of the wall was cleaned
and profiled in detail. A 10-liter sample of each soil horizon was screened. The
trenches and trench walls were photographed, and the location recorded on a
Trimble GeoXT. A total of 10 BHTs were conducted, with terminating depths
ranging from 80 to 120 centimeters below the surface (cmbs).
The remainder of the APE was pedestrian surveyed and augmented by shovel
testing. Shovel tests were excavated in settings with potential for buried cultural
horizons and/or if the ground surface visibility is less than 30 percent. The shovel
tests were excavated at least 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter to the bottom of
Holocene deposits, if possible. The shovel tests were dug in 10 cm levels, and the
excavated sediments were screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth unless high
clay or water content required the material be troweled through or sorted by
hand. Shovel tests were recorded on logs and the locations of the tests will be
recorded on a GIS unit. Other field forms include a daily journal, photograph log,
and site forms.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

The survey was conducted under pleasant warm conditions in the mornings
under a clear sky, with a slight breeze. No issues arose during the survey of the
originally proposed APE.
5.1

Field Results

The APE runs generally from northeast to southwest following a tributary of
Henrietta Creek. The northeast terminus begins in Haslet Community Park
(Photo 1), then crosses BNSF railroad tracks (Photo 2) into ranchlands (Photo 3).
As it continues southwest, the APE crosses Avondale Haslet Road (Photo 4) as it
reaches ranchland (Photo 5), where it terminates (Photo 6). Survey of the APE
began at the northeast terminus.
As seen on Figure 6, five trenches were placed north of Avondale Haslet Road
(two within the park and three within ranchland) and five trenches were placed
south of Avondale Haslet Road (all within ranch land). One shovel test was
placed north of Avondale Haslet Road north of the tributary where a backhoe
could not access (see Photo 5). Two more shovel tests were placed near the
southern terminus (see Photo 6). All shovel tests were negative for cultural
materials. The area around the BNSF railroad tracks were not surveyed
subsurface as the land was highly disturbed due to railroad construction and
maintenance and due to the negative previous survey of 2009. Ground visibility
for the APE was generally low due to overgrown grass.

Trench Descriptions

Ten BHTs were excavated within Frio soil along the unnamed tributaries to
Henrietta Creek. The BHTs were approximately 15 feet (4.5 meters) long, 3 feet (1
meter) wide, and 4-5 feet (1-1.5 meters) deep, which is the depth of impacts. The
trench walls were examined for the presence of cultural material, and a onemeter section of the wall was cleaned and profiled in detail. A 10-liter sample of
each soil horizon was screened. Each trench was photographed, and the location
was recorded on a Trimble GeoXT (see Figure 6). Below are the soil profiles and
photos of each BHT. No cultural material was located during exploratory
trenching.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

On August 30, and September 4 through 6, 2018, aci consulting conducted a
cultural resources survey for the FW-HASLET-TRA Sewer Project in Tarrant
County, Texas. The APE for this project consists of the 50-foot ROW for the
proposed 1.24-mile sewer line, for a total of 7.53 acres (3.05 hectares) (see Figures
1 and 2).
The investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey with backhoe trenching
augmented by shovel testing and did not result in the location of new or
previously recorded archeological sites, nor any other historic properties. Based
on these results, no further archeological work is recommended. It must be noted
that no level of survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural features
within a project area. Therefore, should previously-unrecorded cultural
resources, including human remains, be discovered during the course of
construction for this project, the City of Haslet will contact a qualified
professional archeologist to assess the findings.
