This report documents the findings and recommendations of a cultural resource inventory conducted on 878 acres
at Lake B.A. Steinhagen and Lake Sam Rayburn in East Texas. Work was conducted for the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, which has proposed timber harvesting within the selected tracts. In
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventories were conducted to ensure
that any cultural resource sites would be considered in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork included a 100 percent pedestrian survey accompanied by excavation of 523 shovel tests.
Recovered artifacts included historic ceramics, metal, glass, prehistoric lithic flakes, and one projectile point. All
artifacts will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Archival research was also conducted on
one historic site. One new historic site and one new prehistoric site were discovered. Historic site 41SA290 is
recommended as not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and no further work is warranted.
The significance of prehistoric site 41NA305 could not be clearly assessed using the limited shovel test inventory
tactics - it has an unknown NRHP eligibility status and should be avoided and protected from adverse impacts.

Jasper, Nacogdoches, and San Augustine Counties, Texas

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on four separate tracts of land totaling 878 acres at Lake B.A.
Steinhagen and Lake Sam Rayburn in East Texas. Work was conducted at the request of the
Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District
(USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting within the selected tracts and, in
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventories were
conducted to ensure that any cultural resource sites located on the parcels would be considered in
planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork was completed between October 17-26, 2007. Fieldwork included a
100 percent pedestrian survey accompanied by manual excavation of 523 shovel tests.
Recovered artifacts included historic ceramics, metal, glass, prehistoric lithic flakes, and one
projectile point. All subsurface artifacts were recovered and will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). Archival research was also conducted on one
historic site.
One new historic site and one new prehistoric site were discovered and documented. Historic
site 41SA290 is recommended as not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
and no further work is warranted. The NRHP eligibility of prehistoric site 41NA305 could not
be clearly assessed using the limited shovel test inventory tactics; it has an unknown NRHP
eligibility status and should be avoided and protected from adverse impacts.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

THE UNDERTAKINGS

The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs and
navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 17,461 acres at Lake Sam
Rayburn, and 7,943 acres at Lake B.A. Steinhagen (acreages are outside conservation pools)
(Figure 1-1).
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account. Therefore, in compliance with Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89-665 et
seq.), the inventories were authorized by the USACE to identify any archeological sites,
buildings, structures, or other resources that may be eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All inventories were conducted and all sites are located on
lands owned by the Federal Government and managed by the USACE.
Much of the USACE managed acreage at both lakes are forested by mature pine and hardwood
stands. In conjunction with the existing management plans for the reservoirs and in accordance
with accepted silviculture methodologies, the USACE has planned certain management areas for
selective timber thinning at these lakes. Commercial thinning removes marketable trees in
uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through single tree selection. Removal of crop trees often
disturbs the ground surface, but extensive subsurface disturbance is not common.

LOCATION

The total project area consists of five separate parcels (Table 1-1). Four of these are located at
Lake Sam Rayburn in San Augustine and Nacogdoches Counties and the fifth parcel is located at
Lake B.A. Steinhagen in Jasper County, Texas. Together, the five parcels total 878 acres and
range in size from a minimum of 39 acres to a maximum of 573 acres.

1.2.1

Lake Sam Rayburn

Lake Sam Rayburn was authorized by Congress in 1955 for the purposes of flood control along
the Angelina River, hydroelectric power generation, and conservation of water for
municipalities, industry, agriculture, and recreation. Construction of the reservoir was begun by
the USACE in 1956, and impoundment began in 1965. Initially known as McGee Bend
Reservoir, the lake was renamed in honor of Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Sam
Rayburn. The lake is the largest body of water within the boundaries of the State of Texas. At
conservation pool level (164.4 ft above mean sea level), the lake has approximately 750 miles of
shoreline (Figure 1-1). The current inventory includes four parcels totaling 305 acres.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS

1.4.1

Underlying Geological Formations

The project area contains five separate parcels, each of which is located near or along the edge of
the Angelina River. Four of the five parcels are located at Lake Sam Rayburn while the fifth
parcel is closer to Lake B.A. Steinhagen. The geological formations of the parcels adjacent to
Lake Sam Rayburn consist of the Claiborne and Jackson Groups of the upper Eocene. Within
these groups, varying formations compose the underlying bedrock (AAPG 1979).
At Lake Sam Rayburn, bedrock under the Mouth of Carizzo parcel consists of the Cook
Mountain formation of the Claiborne group. The Cook Mountain formation is positioned across
the landscape in an easterly to westerly direction, increasing in thickness towards the west from
about 100 ft (30 m) to 370 ft (113 m) in thickness. The bedrock formation of the Buck Branch
parcel is the Caddell formation of the Jackson group. The Caddell formation measures 25 ft (7.6
m) to 45 ft (13.7 m) in thickness and is comprised of clay and a fine grained quartz sand that is
typically brown in color. Three bedrock formations are mapped within the Sandy Creek parcel.
The western-most portion of the parcel is comprised of the Caddell formation as seen at the Buck

Branch parcel. The central portion of the parcel, consisting of the majority of acreage within the
parcel is comprised of Quaternary alluvium. The geological formation of the eastern portion of
the parcel is the Yazoo formation of the Jackson group. The Yazoo formation is an interbedded
formation of clay and sand, typically light brownish gray in color and measures up to 200 ft. in
thickness. This formation is also the underlying bedrock at the Powell Point parcel.
Near Lake Steinhagen, the Forks of the Rivers parcel is ntirely comprised of Holocene
Quaternary alluvium, representing approximately 12,000 years of alluvial floodplain deposition.

Soil Formations

Powell Point
Soils within the Powell Point survey area include the Metcalf-Sawtown complex, EastwoodLatex complex, and Moswell loam (Table 1-2). Typical pedons are described in Appendix B.
All soil descriptions and profiles are from USDA-SCS (2007).

Within the Powell Point parcel, the majority of soils are classified under the Metcalf-Sawtown
complex. The Metcalf Series is a Pleistocene age loamy alluvial or marine sediment,
characterized as being deep, slowly permeable, soils that are typically poorly drained. These
soils are located on broad to nearly level marine or stream terraces and usually have a slope
ranging to two percent. The Sawtown series are loamy soils typically located along nearly level
marine or stream terraces. These soils are well drained, very deep, moderately permeable, and
nearly level.
Eastwood-Latex complex soils were also encountered within the Powell Point parcel. These
soils make up about one-third of the total soils within the parcel (Table 1-2). Eastwood series
soils are located on moderately steep to gently sloping uplands, with slopes ranging up to 20
percent. These soils are very slowly permeable, deep soils that are typically well drained. These
soils formed within marine deposits of silty clay loam. Latex series soils are comprised of slowly
permeable, deep soils that are also well drained. These soils are located on wide gently sloping
and nearly level terraces.
Also within the Powell Point parcel, three acres of Moswell loam are mapped (Table 1-2). Soils
in this series are typically deep and xtend down to shale or mudstone. They are characterized as

being well drained and very slowly permeable, with slopes ranging up to 15 percent. These soils
are usually located on gently sloping to moderately steep uplands.
Mouth of Carizzo Bayou
The Mouth of Carizzo Bayou parcel contains roughly equal proportions of Attoyac fine sandy
loam, Cuthbert fine sandy loam, and Kirvin fine sandy loam (Table 1-3). Typical pedons are
described in Appendix B. Soil descriptions and profiles are from USDA-SCS (2007).

Attoyac fine sandy loam occurs in 36 percent of the Mouth of Carizzo Bayou parcel. This deep
soil is located on sloping to moderately steep upland terraces with slopes ranging up to 15
percent. The formation commonly occurs in areas containing wind modified alluvial deposits.
Thirty-three percent of the parcel is represented by Kirvin fine sandy loam which commonly
occurs on gently sloping to sloping, narrow and broad ridges, round knobs, and inter-stream
divides. These soils typically have slopes ranging up to eight percent and are deep, usually down
to stratified shale and sandstone.
The remaining 31 percent of the parcel is represented by Cuthbert fine sandy loam, a moderately
deep soil overlying weakly consolidated shale and sandstone. These soils characteristically have
strongly sloping to moderately steep soils, commonly located on higher areas overlooking major
drainageways. Slopes of these soils commonly range from 8 to 25 percent, however they can
range up to 40 percent.
Buck Branch
The Buck Branch parcel is dominated by Mattex-lulus complex soils (Table 1-4). These soils are
deep loams found either in separate deposits or in a mixture of the two. Other soils present on
the parcel area include the Alazan-Besner complex and the Metcalf-Sawtown complex. In
addition, small, dispersed pockets of Moswell and Rayburn soils are present (Table 1-4).
Typical pedons are described in Appendix B. Soil descriptions and profiles are from USDASCS (2007).
The Mattex-Iulus complex is comprised of intermixed Mattex series soils and Iulus series soils.
Mattex series soils are very deep, slowly permeable loamy soils that are somewhat poorly
drained. These soils are nearly level and form in loamy clayey alluvium. The Iulus series soils
are similarly very deep but are moderately well drained and moderately permeable. Also nearly

The Mattex and Iulus series soils occur in isolated pockets across the landscape. There is a small
pocket of soil at the northeastern corner of the parcel that is solely comprised of Iulus fine sandy
loam. This portion only represents less than one acre of the parcel, while an area at the southern
end of the parcel encompasses about 11 acres and is comprised of only Mattex clay loam.
The southwestern portion of the parcel contains soils characterized as the Alazan-Besner
complex. This complex is comprised of both Alazan series and Besner series soils that are both
typically very deep, moderately well drained, and moderately permeable. The Alazan series soils
typically form in loamy alluvial or marine sediments, while the Besner series soils are formed in
alluvial sediments and are found on mounded Pleistocene terraces that have been somewhat
reworked by wind. The slopes of these soils typically range up to two percent while the Besner
soils can range up to five percent.
Along the western portion of the parcel, at the northwestern most corner and along the western
most edge of the center, pockets of the Metcalf-Sawtown complex are present. This complex is
comprised of soils from the Metcalf series and the Sawtown series. These soils make up two
percent of the total parcel and are the same as those at the Powell Point parcel.
Moswell loam, present in this parcel, was observed before at Powell Point, however the soil
represented here is slightly different. The Moswell loam soils seen at the Powell Point parcel
was denoted as MsD, and the Moswell loam seen at this parcel is denoted as MsB. MsB soils are
characteristically deep soils on slightly concave to smooth, gently sloping, wide interstream
divides. These soils typically form in marine shales and clays. The surfaces of these soils are
distinguished by gilgai or humps about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) high. This type of soil only
occurs on five percent of the parcel. Although the MsB loam is slightly different from the MsD
loam seen at Powell Point, it is from the same series (Moswell Series), and therefore consists of
the same pedon.
The final soil represented at the parcel is Rayburn loam of the Rayburn series (Table 1-4). This
loam pocket is present in less than one acre at the extreme southeastern corner of the inventory
area. The soils of the Rayburn series are deep, moderately well drained upland soils that are very

slowly permeable. These soils were formed from tuffaceous siltstones and sandstones with
slopes ranging from up to 20 percent.
Sandy Creek
Of the 130 acres surveyed at Sandy Creek, the Mattex-Iulus complex predominates at 35 percent
of the total area. This soil type is followed by Laneville loam covering about 22 percent of the
parcel, Metcalf Sawtown complex, at 17 percent, Penning-Kurth complex, at 15 percent, Mattex
clay loam, at 4.6 percent, Rayburn Loam, at 3.8 percent, and Moswell loam, at 2.6 percent (Table
1-5). All but two of these soils were encountered at other parcels within the vicinity of Lake
Sam Rayburn. Typical pedons are described in Appendix B. Soil descriptions and profiles are

The Penning-Kurth complex is composed of two types of soil series, the Penning series, and the
Kurth series. Soils of the Penning series are deep soils typically to the underlying shale deposits.
These soils are typically well drained soils that are moderately permeable, and are found on
nearly level uplands. Soils of the Kurth series are very deep soils, typically to underlying
geological materials of sandstone and mudstone. These soils are moderately well drained and
slowly permeable, usually formed in loamy coastal plain sediments. Kurth soils are located on
gently sloping to moderately sloping uplands with slopes ranging up to eight percent.
Laneville loam soils are classified as a Laneville series type. These loamy soils are
characteristically very deep, moderately well drained, and slowly permeable, typically found on
flood plains. The formation of these soil types occur in nearly level loamy and clayey alluvium.
Forks of the Rivers
The Forks of the Rivers parcel is located outside the Lake Sam Rayburn vicinity, near Lake B.A.
Steinhagen. The geology of the area is different from those near Lake Sam Rayburn, and is
reflected in the soils. Soils within the Forks of the Rivers parcel are comprised by two different
complexes, the Besner-Molliville complex and the Bienville-Alaga complex (Table 1-6) The
Besner-Molliville complex dominates the parcel area. Typical pedons are described in Appendix
B. Soil descriptions and profiles are from USDA-SCS (2007).

The Besner-Molliville complex is comprised of two soil series, the Besner series and the
Molliville series. Soils of the Besner series are located on terraces and are characterized as being
deep, gently undulating loamy, well drained, moderately permeable soils. The formation of
theses soils occur in loamy sediments modified by wind, generally with soil slopes ranging to
three percent. Soils of the Molliville series are loamy, typically deep, and nearly level or gently
undulating, and are poorly drained. The slopes of the soils are usually found on terraces. The
formation of these soils occurred in thick, stratified, loamy sediments.
The remaining of the parcel is comprised of the Bienville-Alaga complex, which consists of soils
of the Bienville series and soils from the Alaga series. Soils of the Bienville series are
characterized as deep, gently undulating, sandy, and excessively drained. These soils are located
on terraces near the river bottom lands. The formation of these soils occurs from sandy alluvium
from sandy coastal plain sediments. These soils have slopes that range up to five percent. Soils
of the Alaga series are deep, gently undulating, sandy, and excessively drained. These soils are
found on terraces along major streams, and were formed in thick fluvial beds of sands and loamy
sands, with slopes ranging up to five percent.
1.4.3

Archaeological Potential of the Soils

The landscape of East Texas and Northwestern Louisiana is generally characterized as âweakly
consolidated, Tertiary age fluvial-deltaic deposits of predominantly sandy textureâ (Frederick et
al. 2002:191), known as the Sandy Mantle. In Texas, the sandy mantle is a soil formation that
âextends in a slowly expanding pattern from south of San Antonio in a northeasterly direction
into east Texasâ (Nickels and Lehman 2004:107), closely following the distribution of sandy
Eocene deposits, known as the Claiborne formation. The location of four of the five inventoried
parcels, near Lake Sam Rayburn, are within this geographical feature, and it is reflected by the
soils encountered within the parcels. The fifth parcel, Mouth of the Carizzo Bayou, however is
located just outside of the sandy mantle boundaries.
Archaeological significance of the sandy mantle area is currently heavily debated because the
age and origin of this formation is unknown (Boulter et al. 2007). Stratigraphically, the sandy
mantle is comprised of an AâEâBt pedon, with the Bt pedon dating to the Pleistocene. The
problems encountered with archaeological projects located in this area lie in the debate as to the
age of the sands; rather, the formation of the AâE pedons. Some scientists argue that the
formation of the sandy mantle is predominately of pedogenic origins, whereas others argue that
the formation is attributed to colluvial and eolian processes (see Heinrich 1986; Rogers 1994;
Thoms 1993). According to Frederick et al. (2002:191â192), if the soils over the Bt horizon âare
the product of in situ pedological weathering of Tertiary bedrock, then the AâEâBt horizon all
formed simultaneously from the same parent material,â therefore cultural material found within
these soils were affected by pedoturbation, meaning, âthese sites would have minimal integrity

13

Cultural Resource Inventory of 878 Acres at B.A. Steinhagen and Sam Rayburn Lakes,
Jasper, Nacogdoches, and San Augustine Counties, Texas

and would be unworthy of preservation or excavation.â However, if the soils are a product of
colluvial and eolian processes, the underlying argillic formation (Bt pedons), was already
established, therefore cultural material within these soils are in context and have archaeological
significance (Frederick et al. 2002:191â192).
Research geared towards understanding the formation of the sandy mantle has been on going by
various projects within the sandy mantle area (e.g. Boulter et al. 2007; Bruseth and Martin 2001;
Frederick et al. 2000, 2002; Nickels and Lehman 2004). One in particular, Fredrick et al. (2002)
provides evidence of eolian deposition on uplands, based on optically stimulated luminescence
(OSL) dating. In their research, 33 samples were collected from an excavated trench at
41LE191. Seven of the samples were collected from the sand above the Bt horizon, one from the
Bt horizon, six from unconsolidated sands, and 19 others from the same profile, as a control.
Results of their findings (see Fredrick et al. 2002), shows that sands covering the hill at 41LE191
were deposited during the Holocene and were not a product of in situ deposition. However this
is only shown for this area, other research shows that it can be applied throughout the sandy
mantle area.
From 2002 to 2003, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State University
conducted extensive archaeological work within the 11,500 acre confines of Camp Swift in
Bastrop County. One of the primary research issues addressed by CAS during their work was the
formation of the sandy mantle. For the survey phase, CAS conducted a study measuring the
depth of the sand deposits based on depths recorded from the excavations of over 800 shovel
tests in 57 different locations within the Camp Swift Texas National Guard base. Their research
compared depths within different settings (i.e. terraces, foot slopes, side slopes, drainageways,
ridges, and uplands), to the vertical distribution of cultural material within these specific
locations. From this research, it was shown that sand depths varied across the landscape, and
âthat the physiographic setting cannot be viewed as an overriding consideration when evaluating
site depth, intensity of use, and integrity,â therefore âsites must be tested on a case-by-case basis
regardless of their settingâ (Nickels and Lehman 2004:124).
In 2002, CAS conducted NRHP eligibility testing on 20 prehistoric sites recorded during the
survey that included the excavation of 120 test units and six backhoe trenches. The results of
testing revealed stratigraphic correlations in the data that suggest some sites within the sandy
mantel indeed contain deep, intact deposits of cultural materials. This conclusion was based on
data gathered from multi-linear, corroborating lines of evidence including soil susceptibility
values, pH values, statistical data, artifact densities and sizes, non-artifact densities and sizes, soil
horizons, archeomagnetic samples, projectile point typology, clay lamella development, and C14
samples (David Nickels, personnel communication 2008; Nickels et al. 2008).
However, the archaeological potential of the soils at the Forks of the Rivers parcel should be
regarded as being low. The parcel is located near the confluence of the Neches and Angelina
River, northeast of Lake B.A. Steinhagen. This area is a topographically low (averaging 90 ft
ASL), flat wooded marsh and floodplain that features no prominent terraces or ridgelines were
prehistoric occupations in East Texas are generally known to occur (Perttula 2004). In addition,
the area is prone to long term inundation and frequent flooding which has resulted in soils that
have a mixed/secondary depositional history with an overall low integrity.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH

2.1.1

Lake Sam Rayburn

CULTURAL CONTEXT

The earliest documented archeological investigations in the vicinity of the now Lake Sam
Rayburn were conducted during the late 1930s by the Works Progress Administration (WPA)
under the direction of Gus Arnold. Some 23 sites were reported by the WPA (Arnold 1940). A
decade later, the River Basin Surveys under the direction of Stephenson recorded 57 additional
sites within the area of the proposed reservoir (Stephenson 1948a, 1948b). This work was
followed in the late 1950s and early 1960s by limited surveys by the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project (TASP) (Davis, n.d., Jelks 1965).
Since completion of the reservoir, numerous systematic inventories have been conducted on
behalf of the Corps of Engineers. Between 1993 and 2001, these studies have investigated more
than 3,700 acres and recorded 58 sites (Ferring 1993a; Nichols 1994; Trask et al. 1996; Keller
1998; Trask and Skinner 1998; Skinner and Trask 1999; Corbin 2001; Moore 2001). Since
2002, a series of inventories has been conducted by EComm for the USACE in advance of
timber thinning undertakings (Trierweiler and Bonine 2002; Trierweiler et al. 2002; Trierweiler
and Bonine 2003; Bonine et al. 2004; Jones and Trierweiler 2005, 2006, 2007).
In total, more than 250 sites have been reported in the immediate vicinity of Lake Sam Rayburn.
Of these, fewer than a dozen have been subjected to any subsurface investigations other than
shovel testing. Nine sites received limited exploratory excavations by Jelks. Three of these were
dug in 1956, including 41SA86 Runnels No. 2), 41SA87 (Runnels No. 1), and 41SA89 (Sawmill
site), and were subsequently reported by Curtis Tunnell (Tunnell 1961). The following year
Jelks excavated at 41SA94 (Wylie Price), 41SB36 (Print Bell), and 41SB50 (Walter Bell),
followed in 1959 by 41SA101 (Jonas Short) (Jelks 1965). In 1961 and 1962, the Sabine-Neches
Archeological Society conducted limited excavations at 41SA83 (Zavonian Springs). Finally,
site 41AG66 received extensive shovel testing in 1966 to assess the extent of vandalism (Skinner
and Trask 1996). Despite these investigations, no site at Lake Sam Rayburn has received
extensive data recovery excavations.
2.1.2

Lake B.A. Steinhagen

During the late 1930s, the WPA recorded a handful of archeological sites in the vicinity of the
later Lake Steinhagen (Arnold 1940) and this early work was followed in the 1940s by the RBS
surveys of Stephenson (1948a, 1948b). Approximately a dozen sites were recorded in this
vicinity by these early surveys. In the late 1950s, the TASP recorded several sites at Lake
Steinhagen but a report was not produced.
Beginning in the 1980s, numerous systematic surveys have been conducted on USACE fee lands
at Lake B.A. Steinhagen (see Dervin 1982; Ferring 1993a; 1993b; Carpenter 1994; Leach-Palm
and Rader 1995; Perttula et al. 1998). These surveys totaled more than 1,100 acres and resulted
in the documentation of 24 archeological sites. More recently, EComm has conducted several

Ecological Communications Corporation

inventories for the USACE in advance of timber thinning undertakings (Trierweiler and Bonine
2002; Trierweiler et al 2002; Trierweiler and Bonine 2003; Bonine et al 2004; Jones and
Trierweiler 2006, 2007). In addition, EComm conducted a linear inventory of 6 km at nearby
Martin Dies Jr. State Park (Bonine 2004).
One site at Lake Steinhagen has been the target of systematic subsurface investigations. The Hen
House site (41JP65) was tested in 1977 by TPWD because of continuing erosion (Chafin-Lohse
and Anderson 1979). No sites at Lake Steinhagen have received data recovery excavations.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES

2.2.1

Sites within the Inventory Parcels

A map and records search was conducted using the Texas Historical Commission (THC) Atlas
online database on November 12, 2007. Searches of this database revealed that no previously
recorded sites are located within the project APEs at either lake. Although no prehistoric or
historic archeological sites are known within the project areas, several sites have been recorded
within one mile of the inventory parcels.
2.2.2

Sites and Prior Surveys within One Mile of the Inventory Parcels

Three previously recorded archaeological sites are located within one mile (1,600 m) of the
combined project areas. Two sites, 41SA175 and 41SA283, are within one mile of the Buck
Branch parcel at Lake Sam Rayburn and the third site, 41JP5, is within one mile of the parcel at
Lake B.A. Steinhagen.
Five previous archeological surveys have been conducted near the current inventory parcels. A
single survey is associated with the four Lake Sam Rayburn parcel areas. This River Basin
Survey was conducted in the late 1940s by the Smithsonian Institution under the direction of
archeologist R.L. Stephenson. The purpose this survey was to document sites in the
impoundment area of the then proposed reservoir, now Lake Sam Rayburn. Three additional
surveys have been conducted within one mile of the Buck Branch parcel. These surveys were
conducted on behalf of the USACE in 1993, 1997, and 2001. During the 1993 survey, two areas
were surveyed along the Sam Rayburn shore line. In one of these parcels, site 41SA175 was
recorded about 350 m west of Buck Branch. The second parcel was located about 550 m
southwest and had no sites recorded. The survey conducted in 1997 was located about 850 m
southwest of Buck Branch and contained no sites. At the Fork of the Rivers parcel located near
Lake B.A. Steinhagen, a USACE survey was conducted in 1982 about 1.5 km west of Fork of
the Rivers. This inventory recorded no sites.
Lake Sam Rayburn
Two archaeological sites have been recorded within one mile of Buck Branch at Lake Sam
Rayburn. One of these sites (41SA283) was recorded by Corbin in 2001 and the other site
(41SA175) was recorded by the Corps of Engineers in 1993 (Table 2-1). Site 41SA283 is
16

located about 1.5 km to the west of the Buck Branch parcel. The site, encompassing about 500
m2, is distributed across the ridge of a sandy knoll overlooking the Ayish Bayou. The site
consists of a lithic scatter comprised of flakes, core fragments, and one piece of fire cracked
rock. Due to the lack of diagnostic artifacts, the cultural/temporal affiliation of the site is
unknown. Site 41SA175 is located about 1.4 km southwest of the Buck Branch parcel.
Although the site was given a trinomial designation, no other information besides the location of
the site is known (Carolyn Spock, personal communication, 2007).

Lake B.A. Steinhagen
One previously recorded archaeological site is located within one mile of the Lake B.A.
Steinhagen inventory parcel (Table 2-2). Site 41JP5 was first recorded by G.E. Arnold in 1940
and is described as a campsite located on top of a bluff along the eastern bank of the Angelina
River. The site is concentrated within an area measuring 4,047 m2, and is comprised of a lithic
scatter consisting of a projectile point, flakes of chert and petrified wood, and mussel shells.
Although a projectile point was found, the time period of occupation is not known. One
historical marker is recorded within a mile of the project area. The historical marker was noted
on the 2003 revision of the Pace Hill, Texas USGS 1:24000, sheet and commemorates the 1834
municipality of Bevil, an important river shipping and trade point established along the Angelina
River.

CULTURAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological regions of Texas vary depending on what research is used in determining the
cultural framework of the project area. In some cases, such as in Turner and Hester (1993),
Texas is divided in to nine archeological regions, whereas, Perttula (2004) further divides these
regions, based on physiographic zones and biotic communities, into 16 distinct archeological
regions. Based on Turner and Hesterâs divisions of the archaeological regions of Texas, the
project is located in the East Texas archaeological region, whereas in Perttulaâs (2004)
archaeological regions in the state of Texas model, the project area is located in Deep East
Texas. Whatever that case may be, both models of the archaeological regions of Texas are
correct, however Perttulaâs division better suits the project area ecologically and

physiographically. For the purpose of this report, Perttulaâs (2004), model will be used in
discussing the cultural framework of the region.
The prehistoric cultural framework of the Deep East Texas region includes the Paleo-Indian
period, Archaic and Woodland periods, and periods of Caddo horticultural adaptation. Much of
the information known about this region has been recorded by many archeological
investigations, beginning in the 1930âs. This cultural framework, discussed further below, has
been adapted from Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993a, 1993b, 1995, 2004).
2.3.1

Paleoindian Period

The Paleoindian period describes the time in which North America was first occupied by peoples
migrating from the Old World. The occupation of the New World is due in part to the migration
of extinct fauna (e.g. bison, camel, and horse) across the newly open lands and the people who
followed them, relying on these animals for everyday subsistence. Although this portrayal of the
early occupants of North America is generally accepted among some archeologists, others see
the Paleoindian period as a time in which Pleistocene peoples are separated into Early and Late
stages between ca. 12,000â8,000 B.P. based on cultural traditions of tool technologies (Bousman
et al. 2004).
These stages differ from area to area and region to region depending on the data recorded in
those regions. There is a lack of good data in East Texas relating to the Paleoindian Period (ca.
9500 to 7000 B.C.). While many projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff,
and San Patrice have been recovered, most were isolated, mixed, found on the surface, or found
in excavations of later contexts (Perttula 2004). The distribution of artifacts suggests that most
sites occur within the valleys of major stream basins and resource-rich areas. Available evidence
suggests that groups occupied small camps, used a generalized toolkit, and were more likely to
be highly mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized large-game hunters (Perttula
2004).
2.3.2

Archaic Period

The Archaic stage signifies a shift from big-game hunting subsistence strategies to a less mobile,
more generalized subsistence strategy. This change in subsistence strategies shows a greater
exploitation of local environments with the exploitation of plants and animals located in the
immediate vicinity. Along with the change in subsistence, a change is also seen in lithic
technology. Evidence of this is apparent in the archaeological record where lanceolate-shaped
points gave way to dart points that were stemmed and barbed and the application of groundstone
(Collins 2004). Although Archaic peoples were still nomadic in nature, travel became more
seasonal, utilizing food resources specific to certain localities.
In Texas, the Archaic period is thought to have lasted approximately 7,500 years, from 8800 to
about 1200 B.P or 1300 B.P. and is divided into three sub-stages: the Early Archaic 8800â6000
B.P., the Middle Archaic 6000â4000 B.P., and the Late Archaic 4000â1200 B.P. or 1300 B.P.

18

Cultural Resource Inventory of 878 Acres at Lake B.A. Steinhagen and Lake Sam Rayburn,
Jasper, Nacogdoches, and San Augustine Counties, Texas

(Collins 1995). However, in the East Texas archaeological region, reliable dating is not yet
available to unequivocally substantiate these different periods.
During the Early Archaic period the climate has changed from wet and mild conditions seen in
the Paleoindian stage, to a warmer and drier climate, ultimately leading to severe xeric
conditions during the middle stages of the Early Archaic. These climate changes forced the
peoples of the Early Archaic to broaden their subsistence strategies from hunting bison to include
the exploitation of resources such as acorns, fruits, rodents, deer, and prickly pear (Story
1985:38â39; Weir 1976). Settlement patterns also change during the Early Archaic. Sites are
smaller and more widely distributed, suggesting high group mobility within large territories.
Although most Early Archaic sites are only briefly used, they are apt to be concentrated in the
larger drainage areas in the region (Perttula 2004).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by larger sites within major basins in the region, a more
diverse hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the increased use of plant
foods as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features. Possible hearths, ovens and
burned rock concentrations in the region suggest processing and cooking of plant resources was
important (Perttula 2004).
Throughout East Texas, Late Archaic period sites are relatively common along major streams
and springs in the uplands and on tributary drainages. During the Late Archaic population
density may have peaked, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of sites and
greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread distribution of
sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined territories, and
regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).
2.3.3

Woodland/Early Ceramic Period

The Woodland Period (ca. 200 B.C. â A.D. 800) is not well defined but is largely identified by
plainware ceramics, tempered with clay/grog or bone, and by Gary projectile points. At sites
near the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics, while at other sites in
Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, ceramics are not as common. One
explanation for this difference may be possible regional differences in food processing and diet
during this time period, all of which may have an effect on the degree of sedentism between
regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests that Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers
living in larger groups and settling in given locations for longer periods of time than they had
during the Archaic period. There are some instances (e.g., Skibo and Blinman 1999) in which
pottery making is linked to sedentism, perhaps giving reason to these long stays. In some cases,
such as at the Ray site, small settlements with structures and middens suggest a more
concentrated occupation, but these sites are not as permanent as those seen at later Caddo period
sites in the region (Perttula 2004). With the exception of the Sulphur and Neches-Angelina
River Basins, Woodland sites are not very common throughout much of Northeast Texas, but
when they occur, are represented by villages and hamlets in the floodplains or terraces of larger

streams, and by smaller components in the uplands. No Woodland period burial mounds have
been documented in the region.
2.3.4

Formative Caddoan Period and Early Caddoan Period

Sites dating to the Formative Caddoan Period (ca. A.D. 800-1000) and Early Caddoan Period
(ca. A.D. 1000-1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and
smaller tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were
primarily chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash and native plants. Permanent
settlements including structures, middens, pits, cemeteries, and artifacts such as tools and
ceramics were widespread. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads
with rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities such as the George C. Davis site on the Neches River are also
encountered. These large villages are more common during the Early Caddoan Period and
continue through the Middle Caddoan period, and include large groups of many structures,
mound centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and
earspools, and diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from
Formative and Early Caddoan sites (Perttula 2004).
2.3.5

Middle Caddoan Period

The majority of archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddoan Period (ca.
A.D. 1200-1400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger settlements
with multiple mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddoan Period. One example of such a site is
the Oak Hill Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens, and public structures.
Cultivation of maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of dependence on maize and
other crops until after A.D. 1300 (Perttula 2004).
2.3.6

Late Caddoan Period

Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddoan Period (ca. AD 1400-1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddoan sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches River basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddoan Period
archeological sites are either large permanent communities, or smaller farmsteads, both with
associated cemeteries. Late Caddoan period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily
used between A.D. 1400-1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction and mound
shaft burials continued until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and
bioarcheological evidence from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily
dependent on maize as their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddoan Titus Phase (ca. A.D. 1430-1680) refers to the archeological remains of
Caddoan peoples living in the northeastern Texas pineywoods between the Sulphur and Sabine
rivers. These Caddos lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society. They constructed both
small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements with status-ranked community

cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics. Titus phase sites usually are
found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and basins, and permanent settlements
are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).
2.3.7

Historic Period

Historic Caddoan Period
The Historic Caddoan period (ca. AD 1680-1860) is defined as the sustained European presence
in and occupation of the Caddoan area by Europeans in the region. It is during this time period
that the Caddo and all other Native American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were
eventually moved from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddoan settlements in the
region were small farmsteads and hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities
were composed of many of these farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts
recovered from these sites include a wide variety of Caddoan ceramics, basketry, ornaments, and
bone, stone, and wooden tools. European goods are commonly found on Historic Caddoan sites
after ca. A.D. 1740 and include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as kettles,
hatchets, knives, hoes, lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu and
Perttula, 1993).
European Exploration and Historic Periods
The area around the future Lake Sam Rayburn was re-inhabited by Antonio Gil Ibarvo and his
fellow settlers in 1779 at the location of the previously abandoned mission in the Nacogdoches
area. Areas to the southeast of Nacogdoches along the Angelina River, called the Ayish Bayou
District, were also settled by the Spanish in the late eighteenth century. Shortly after
Nacogdochesâ founding, Ibarvo built a building called the âOld Stone Fortâ for business and
administration, and the settlement became a center for illegal trade between Spanish, French, and
Americans (Long 2005; McDonald 1981). Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
Nacogdoches was the central location of politics in East Texas. The town was sacked by JoaquÃ­n
de Arredondo around 1812 for housing supporters of Augustus Magee and Bernardo GuitiÃ©rrez.
It became the stage for a battle in 1832 that helped instigate the Texas Revolution, as well as the
center of the CÃ³rdova uprising 1838 (McDonald 1981).
San Augustine, the only other densely inhabited area during this time period, also participated
heavily in political activities and conflicts (Crocket 1932). Although the region was constantly
contested in the 1820s and 1830s, Anglo-American settlers continued to come and set up farms
in what would become Nacogdoches, Angelina, San Augustine, Tyler, and Jasper Counties.
Bevilâs Settlement, later called Jasper, was founded in 1824 by John Bevil and became the
county seat of Jasper County in 1844 (Smith 1979). The first ferry and port town in the area,
Town Bluff, was settled on the Neches River in 1833 as part of the Lorenzo de Zavalaâs colony.
Woodville was established in 1846 when Tyler County was formed and quickly established itself
as the county seat.

By 1844, after the Regulator-Moderator War in the east, most of the area had seen the last of
openly violent conflict (McCroskey 2002). However, a new conflict was brewing that eventually
erupted into the Civil War. The region was settled mostly by Southerners who carried the slaverun plantation culture with them; but, unlike their neighbors to the north, much of the
environment was not conducive to cotton production, so many who remained in the area were
poor farmers with few or no slaves, relying on subsistence agriculture, corn, and hogs, as well as
some tobacco, rice, and cattle. Steamboats ferried corn, cotton, and other products down the
Angelina and other navigable rivers to markets in the east, and many towns derived their income
from port fees. As a result, the reaction of the regionâs inhabitants to secession was mixed. The
Mexican population in Nacogdoches did not approve of secession, but the area eventually voted
to support the cause (Long 2005). Angelina County was one of the few counties in the state to
reject secession altogether (Boon 1937). The other counties to the south and east stuck to their
Southern roots and supported the action, sometimes by an overwhelming margin. Once the Civil
War began, all the inhabitants of the region supported the Confederate Army, supplying troops
and some iron goods. San Augustine was occupied by Confederate troops to guard against
invasion, but no battles were fought in the area.
Nacogdoches, Woodville, and Jasper were occupied by Union troops during Reconstruction, and
some KKK-like organizations were formed to force African-American activists out of the area;
however, these organizations dissolved soon after they were created. The region suffered
economically after the Civil War, and it did not begin to recover until the railroads were built in
the 1880s. All but San Augustine County had railroads built by the end of the nineteenth
century, and this mode of transportation enabled lumbering to be developed in full force. Towns
such as Colmesneil, Rockland, Browndell, Zavilla, and Broaddus sprung up around new
sawmills, and existing towns began to harvest nearby timber for a new source of income (St.
Clair and St. Clair 1982; Wooster 2001). However, poor timber renewal practices and the
Depression caused timber sales to plummet in the 1930s, and several small towns were deserted.
In most areas, livestock raising began to replace what little cotton production was present, and
modest oil extraction was developed to support the economy in Nacogdoches and Jasper
Counties. However, the primary economy remained agricultural, and the people maintained a
steady rural lifestyle. Timber harvesting was revived during and after World War II but not to
the extent of previous years. Other areas began planting sugar cane, raising poultry, and
manufacturing tung (to make lacquer). Lake Sam Rayburn was completed in 1965, and tourism
helped to revive the regional economy.

METHODS

The archeological field inventory was conducted over a period of 10 workdays between October
17-26, 2007. Approximately 40 person-days were spent in the field. Methods and density of
shovel testing complied with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements for field tactics stipulated
by the USACE for archeological inventories in east Texas (USACE 2007:39-51).
3.1

SURVEY TACTICS

For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance with transect lines indicated at 20 m
intervals on aerial photographs. Each field archeologist was given a copy of the aerial and was
assigned a transect line and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect lines were designated
with an alpha prefix and individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered, so that
shovel test G-5 identified the fifth test along the seventh transect (Transect G). In general, each
crewmember followed his/her own transect, walking in parallel with the other crewmembers.
Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two crewmembers doubled up with one person digging the
shovel tests and another screening and recording the field forms, or two crew members would
âleapfrogâ along one transect, each digging alternating shovel tests. While approximately even
coverage was attempted, surveyors deviated from transect alignments in order to test high
probability locations. Tests were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to
be preferred site locations, such as ridgelines, knolls, and promontories. Areas of obvious deep
disturbance, such as bulldozing, were noted on the field maps and were excluded from shovel
testing. Similarly, areas that were completely inundated were excluded from transect coverage,
including low swampy areas, ponds, and all areas underneath current lake levels.
Recent debris, such as aluminum cans, beer bottles and plastic detritus, was commonly observed,
especially along shorelines at both lakes. No further attention was paid to such items clearly less
than 50 years old.
At all positive shovel tests and at selected other tests, GPS readings were taken to verify transect
and shovel test locations. All shovel tests were 30 to 35 cm in diameter. All tests were dug to
the bottom of the Holocene deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cm below ground surface if no
clay was present. Tests were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and
cultural material present. Tests were dug in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in
thickness and all excavated material was screened through Â¼-inch (6.4 mm) mesh.
All cultural material within shovel tests was collected with the exception of recent objects such
as bottle glass shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to indicate recent
disturbance and were not collected. All shovel tests were backfilled.
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in the
immediate vicinity at 5 to 15 m distances for up to six tests in an area. If more than one of these
tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test, then the location
was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an isolated occurrence.
The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected, but these were not
further recorded. The recorded locations of previously recorded sites were similarly investigated

using multiple shovel tests. On each site a permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch
iron re-bar fixed with an aluminum tag. Tags were stamped with âECOMM 2007â and with a
temporary field site number for newly recorded sites.
Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify zones
of zero or low artifact presence. Generally, these were in cardinal directions from the initial
positive test, unless topography suggested an alternative tactic. Site boundaries were defined on
the basis of subsurface artifact distribution, complemented by surface artifacts and features
(where present), topography, soil exposures, and other relevant criteria. Additionally, sites along
the shoreline were visually inspected for artifact distribution, and site size was determined by the
extent of the surface artifacts. Based on the distribution of negative shovel tests or absence of
surface artifacts, site boundaries were prominently marked with fluorescent pink flagging tape.
Sites were photographed, sketched and mapped, and all site data were recorded onto State of
Texas site data forms. All recovered artifacts were processed and analyzed by the authors of this
report in ECommâs Austin laboratory. Artifacts, notes and records will be curated at TARL.
Appendix A presents aerial photographs of each survey parcel showing the locations of all
transects and shovel tests. Appendix B summarizes typical soil profiles within the several survey
parcels. Site locations are depicted on USGS topographic quadrangles in Appendix C, and
completed State of Texas site forms are presented in Appendix D.
3.2

DENSITY OF SHOVEL TESTING

The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum, one shovel test
was to be excavated per three acres (0.33 tests per acre). Using this rate of coverage, a minimum
of 293 shovel tests was required to inventory the 878 acres (Table 3-1). Field crews attempted to
exceed this rate of coverage and at the conclusion of field work, a total of 523 shovel tests had
been dug. This number exceeds the required minimum by 230 tests (27 percent). Intensity of
shovel testing varied from parcel to parcel depending on ground visibility, vegetation and
topography. Shovel testing density varied from a minimum of 0.46 tests per acre at the Buck
Branch parcel at Lake Sam Rayburn to a maximum of 1.02 tests per acre at the Mouth of Carizzo
Bayou parcel at Lake Sam Rayburn. For the project as a whole, final coverage averaged 0.60
tests per acre.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research was conducted on those sites where archeological evidence indicated an
occupation during the historic period. The purpose of the archival research was to identify
historically notable persons possibly associated with each site. Initial archival research was
carried out by examining the primary sources in the deed, land title, and probate records. The
landowners, their heirs, assigns, and grantees were identified. This research was conducted in
San Augustine, Texas for San Augustine County.
The identified persons were then further researched for historic significance. Individuals of
historic significance were defined as those who have merited an individual listing in The
Handbook of Texas Online published by the Texas State Historical Association and the General
Libraries of the University of Texas at Austin. If a person of historical significance was in any
way associated with the properties, capsule biography information was compiled and the nature
of the personâs relationship with the area and the tracts was further researched to determine the
level of the personâs involvement. Persons residing on a piece of property and/or actively
participating in its development were determined to be significantly associated with the property.
Persons owning a piece of property but not residing there nor actively participating in its
development (eg., absentee owners) were determined to be not significantly associated with the
property.
3.4

EVALUATION OF SIGNIFICANCE

Historic properties may be nominated for the NRHP, or may be determined eligible for such
nomination, under evaluation criteria that are expressed at 36 CFR Â§ 60.4.
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering
and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess
integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association
(36 CFR Â§ 60.4).
Significance is further defined in four criteria. Cultural resources are considered significant if:
(a) they are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
(b) they are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) they embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method of construction,
or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose component may lack individual
distinction; or
(d) they have yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or
history (36 CFR Â§ 60.4).

Ecological Communications Corporation

Cultural resources may qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under any of the four evaluation
criteria. In this study, prehistoric sites were evaluated for significance and with respect to NHPA
criterion (d). The demonstrated data content of each site was compared to the important research
contexts as outlined above. Sites in good condition and state of preservation and having several
data types bearing on one or more of the research contexts were evaluated as significant under
criterion (d). Those sites that were observed to be in poor condition or state of preservation
and/or sites with no data types bearing on one or more of the research contexts were evaluated as
not significant. Finally, sites whose expression could not be satisfactorily investigated using the
survey level tactics employed by this study were classified as being of unknown significance.
Historic sites, in addition to being evaluated under criterion (d) as described above, were also
evaluated for NRHP eligibility with respect to criterion (b). Because none of the historic sites
retained any architectural elements, criterion (c) was not applicable. Similarly, none of the sites
are associated with important historical events and so criterion (a) was not applicable.

one new historic site, 41SA290.
Site 41SA290
Site 41SA290 (ECOMM 101) is a newly discovered early twentieth century homestead that also
contains an unidentified prehistoric component located in the southeastern portion of the Sandy
Creek parcel. The site is at an elevation of 176 ft. ASL and is situated on a slightly raised terrace
adjacent to the south of an ephemeral drainage. Site dimensions are estimated as approximately
160 by 120 m (Figure 4-3). Vegetation noted within the site included mixed stands of hardwood
and pine. Surface visibility was approximately 10 percent. Soils fell within the Laneville loam

with this site was probably razed after the USACE acquired the land in the mid twentieth century.

Cultural Resource Inventory of 878 Acres at B.A. Steinhagen and Sam Rayburn Lakes,
Jasper, Nacogdoches, and San Augustine Counties, Texas

Historical Research
Site 41SA290 is located on a league of land patented by William Lakey from the Mexican
Republic in 1835. Lakey (40 yrs), his wife, four children, and two individuals who were
probably enslaved persons, are listed in the 1835 Census for Sabine (TxGenWeb Project 2008),
which at that time probably encompassed Site 41SA290. Hence, it may be inferred that Lakey
probably did occupy his league, if only for a short time, although it may be unlikely that he lived
at the location currently designated as archeological site 41SA290. In January of 1838, he sold
the entirety of his land to Thomas Huling, a merchant and land speculator who lived in nearby
Jasper County (Wooster 2008). Huling appears to have subdivided the land, selling 3,321 acres
later that year to James Espy and Alexander Piper. Espy and Piper were likely also investors;
neither name appears on the census for San Augustine County in 1850, 1860, or 1870. In 1857
Espy and Piper transferred ownership of the Lakey property to their sons, Kirk Espy and James
Piper. In 1880, the heirs of Kirk Espy and James Piper sold 100 acres to Martha Shipp. Given
the small size of the parcel compared to the more than 3,000 acres which they were originally
deeded, it seems reasonable to assume that the heirs of Piper and Espy were subdividing the
property into many different small farms and selling them to various landowners. The following
year, Shipp sold the same 100-acre property to Henry Powell.
At this point the land was probably being used as farmland. It is not known whether Powell
lived on this land but in 1890, he sold the entire 100 acres to T.J. Jacks, a resident of San
Augustine County. In 1880, he was a 24 year old (US Census 1880) farmer living with his wife
and two children. He also appears to have had later interests in the neighboring land parcel to
the south, as his name appears on deed records for that tract as well starting around 1896. In
1895, he sold the 100-acre Lakey tract to J.H. Latimer, a 27 year old farmer. According to the
1900 census, he did reside on this property with his wife, Mary and three children (US Census
1900).
In 1908, Latimer and his wife sold the 100-acre Lakey tract to J.G. Langston, who was also a
farmer, and according to the 1910 census he too lived on this property with his wife, and two
sons (US Census 1910). Five years later, he sold the farm to O.C Wise and his wife Lizzie. A
deed from 1918 suggests that the Wises sold the land to another family, the Ritters; however, in
1922 the Ritters sold the land back to the Wises. According to the 1920 census, Lizzie Wise did
live in this part of San Augustine County, with her 12-year old twins and another 14-year old son
(US Census 1920). The census indicates that she was a divorced head of household, and gave
her profession as âfarm managerâ. That she was separated from her husband is confirmed by a
certificate of divorce, dated 1948 and filed in 1950, in which she and O.C. Wise split the 100
acres between them, with the north half going to Lizzie, and the south half going to O.C. Lizzie
sold her half of the land to Temple Lumber Company in 1949. O.C. sold his half of the land in
1949 to O.E. Wise (possibly, a son or brother) who sold the land to Raiford Stripling in 1951.
Raiford Stripling was a well-known restoration architect who lived in San Augustine. Stripling
was responsible for restoration of the kitchen and carriage house for the French Legation in
Austin (Hafertepe 2008). Stripling, however, appears to have purchased the property for
investment purposes; he sold the land to Temple Lumber Company in 1952.

It is interesting to note that the all of the land transactions initiated by the Wises were filed
several years after they took place. For instance, although they undertook a formal division of
land in 1948, resulting from their divorce, the certificate was not filed until two years later.
Moreover, the census records from 1920 suggest that their separation actually occurred well
before that time. In a similar way, the Wises failed to file the 1922 deed, in which the Ritters
sold the land back to them, until 1951. That deed was filed, in fact, on the same day as the deed
in which O.C. Wise sold his half of the property to O.E. Wise, after O.E. Wise had already sold
the land to Raiford Stripling. Though ultimately this did not impact the validity of any of the
deed transactions, the slowness to file does offer a small glimpse into the lives and habits of the
Wises. It suggests that they were independent people who may have shied away from legal
interference in their affairs. Like so many rural Texans in the early twentieth century, they
probably made deals with handshakes and nods, without the urgency to immediately formalize
their transactions.
The remains at Site 41SA290 relate to the time when the parcel was farmed, from around 1890
onward, which comports with the types of artifacts and features recovered at the site. Most of
the artifacts date to the early twentieth century, to the time when the Latimer family, J.G.
Langston, or the Wises owned the property. By 1949, the 100-acre parcel had been broken up
and was sold for its timber potential. Table 4-2 summarizes the chain of title for the property.

Archeological Results
Five features were observed on the surface of the site.
Feature 1 is a circular depression measuring approximately 5 m in diameter and an estimated 50
cm deep. Interpretation of this feature is uncertain but it may be the remnants of a collapsed root
cellar.
Feature 2 is a surface artifact scatter measuring about 10 m in diameter. Historic artifacts
observed on the surface include two whole clear glass bottles, five brown snuff jars, one broken
purple glass wine goblet, one aqua glass plate, the bottom of a white ware vessel with transfer
decorations, three whole blue âVicks Vapo-rubâ jars, and two whiteware sherds.
Feature 3 is the rusted cab and chassis portion of a 1915 Ford Model T truck. The wreck
measures about 4.5 feet wide by about 9 feet long (1.5 by 3 m).
Feature 4 is a debris pile about 40 cm in height and about 4 m in diameter. The pile is located
about three meters southwest of Feature 1 and contains an estimated 50 sandstone cobbles.
Associated artifacts include eight red brick fragments with the âPALMERâ makers mark.
Feature 5 is a circular depression. It measures about 5 m diameter and is deeper than similar
Feature 1 at 1.5 m deep. It is interpreted as a possible collapsed cellar.

A surface artifact inventory was conducted to document the sites surface artifact assemblage and
to help establish boundaries. Including artifacts recorded within the features, 150 artifacts were
recorded on the surface (Table 4-2). Most of these were associated with Feature 2, including
approximately 50 brown, 50 clear, and 10 cobalt blue bottle glass shards each. Fourteen shovel
tests were excavated and cultural material was present in five tests (29 percent ubiquity). Thirtyone historic and seven prehistoric artifacts were recovered between the surface and 40 cmbs.
(Table 4-3). Because the prehistoric artifacts were recovered at the same depth, and above, as
the historic material, it is likely that the prehistoric component has been disturbed by either the
historic era activities or when the site was razed.

Analysis of manufacturing date ranges for all diagnostic artifacts suggests that the site appears to
have been occupied sometime within a 40 to 50 year time span between 1902 and 1943 or 1952

(Table 4-4). These dates correlate with the earliest possible manufacture date of the Palmer
bricks (1902) and the sale of the property in 1949 to the Temple Lumber Company (see previous
discussion). Based on the artifact data, which reflects a broad period spanning several different
landowners, and based on the historical background information that suggests no persons or
events of exceptional significance are associated with this property, it is recommended that Site
41SA290 is not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places under any criteria.

MOUTH OF CARIZZO BAYOU

The Mouth of Carizzo Bayou area totaled 41 acres and was inventoried using 42 shovel tests for
a density of 1.02 shovel tests per acre. The survey within the parcel resulted in the discovery of
one prehistoric site (41NA305).
Site 41NA305
Site 41NA305 (ECOMM 103) is a prehistoric campsite dating to the archaic period located on the
western portion of the Mouth of Carizzo Bayou parcel (Figures 4-9 and 4-10). Site dimensions
are estimated as approximately 140 by 80 m. The site is topographically situated on an elevated
terrace (170 ft ASL) that forms a peninsula that extends northward into the mouth of Carrizo
Creek which joins Lake Sam Rayburn west of the site. Soils within the site fell within the
Attoyac fine sandy loam series; the typical pedon for this soil is presented in Chapter 1.
Vegetation within the site consisted of mixed stand of hardwoods and pine. The portion of the
site in proximity to the lake has been slightly impacted by erosion, and surface visibility was 10
percent.

The site was discovered at the location of shovel test 6-3 . Twelve additional shovel tests were
excavated for a total of 13 tests (Table 4-5). Artifacts were recovered from nine of the 13 tests
for a ubiquity measure of 69 percent. The assemblage consists of 14 lithic flakes, one core
fragment, and one projectile point in two probable components between 0-20 and 40-100 cmbs.
A small fragmentary burned bone specimen was collected in test E between 60-80 cmbs. In
addition, two sandstone fire-cracked rock and some charcoal staining was observed in test 8-2
between 80-100 cmbs. All lithic material was manufactured from either petrified wood or chert
colored red, brown, and white. Sterile clay was encountered at depths between 60-100 cmbs.

The excavated projectile point is nearly complete but has a flaking scar that has removed a small
portion of the stem (Figure 4-11). The point is roughly flaked with a small amount of beveling
along the right edge of both faces. Total length of the artifact is 4 cm; maximum width is 1.90
cm; stem width is 1.15 cm; maximum body thickness is 0.80 cm. The material is petrified wood
with small amounts of cortex visible on the body. The point resembles a Yarbrough (Suhm and
Jelks 1989: 261-262; Turner and Hester 1993:197) which is dated to the Archaic.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This cultural resources inventory investigated four parcels at Lakes Sam Rayburn and B.A.
Steinhagen in Jasper, Nacogdoches, and San Augustine County. The parcels ranged in size from
39 acres (Buck Branch) to 573 acres (Forks of the Rivers), and the total area inventoried was 878
acres. Field methods included a pedestrian inventory at 20 m intervals accompanied by
excavation of 523 shovel tests. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug
to either the clay horizon or to 80 cm below the surface. Overall testing density for the project
was 0.60 tests per acre (or, 1.6 acres per test).
The inventory documented two new archeological sites. No intact historic building or structure
greater than 50 years old was present in any of the inventory areas. Site 41SA290 is considered
not eligible for the NRHP, and no further work is warranted. The eligibility of site 41NA305 is
considered unknown and further work is necessary to determine eligibility (Table 5-1).

Site 41SA290 is the location of a razed early twentieth century homestead that also contains an
prehistoric component of unknown age. Five features was observed on the surface during the
pedestrian survey including a historic surface dump deposit, two circular depressions, one rock
pile, and a 1915 Model T truck cab. Fourteen shovel tests were excavated; cultural material was
present in five tests (29 percent ubiquity), with 31 historic and 7 prehistoric artifacts recovered
between the surface and 40 cmbs. Due to the fact that historic artifacts were recovered at the
same depth (and below) as the prehistoric material encountered during shovel testing, the
prehistoric component of the site has in all likelihood been impacted by either historic era
activities or when the site was razed. Analysis of the artifact assemblage suggests that the site
was occupied sometime between 1902 and 1949. Archival research indicated that the site was
not associated with any historically significant individual. Based on the low integrity of deposits
and the results attained from archival research, EComm recommends that the site is not eligible
for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is warranted.
Site 41NA305 is a newly recorded prehistoric campsite located on an elevated terrace that forms
a peninsula that extends north into Carizzo Creek. Thirteen shovel tests were excavated and
artifacts were recovered from nine of the 13 tests. Vertical distribution of artifacts suggests two
possible components: four artifacts were recovered between 0-20 cmbs and 15 were recovered
between 40-100 cmbs. Artifacts recovered included 14 lithic flakes, one core fragment, and one
Yarbrough projectile point which dates the upper component to the Archaic period. In addition,

two sandstone fire-cracked rock (FCR), charcoal, one burned bone fragment, were recovered and
charcoal staining was observed. The presence of buried deposits of both FCR and faunal
remains and the charcoal suggests that the site may have the potential to provide significant
information regarding the prehistoric adaptation and subsistence strategies employed by the
inhabitants of East Texas during the Archaic. However, based on the limited shovel testing
tactics employed during the surface inventory, the overall character of the site is unknown and
the research potential and NRHP eligibility of the site are therefore also unknown. EComm
recommends that the site be avoided until additional investigations can test the research potential
and NRHP eligibility of the site.
