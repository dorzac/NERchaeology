Investigations of the Buried City,
Ochiltree County, Texas:
With an Emphasis on the Texas Archeological Society Field
Schools of 1987 and 1988
David T. Hughes

ABSTRACT
The first four seasons of investigations on the Courson ranch on Wolf Creek
in Ochiltree County resulted in excavation of six prehistoric house sites, intensive
archeological survey of several square miles of the creek bottom, and the salvage
of a Pleistocene mammoth. The results of these investigations have provided us
with information on an unusual village assemblage in the northeastern Texas
Panhandle that dates from about A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1400 and includes large, stonebased houses, ornamented pottery, and excellent information about the distribution
of trash and artifacts in relation to the houses. These investigations have shown that
the Buried City and adjacent sites are a unique resource that has been too long
overlooked or misplaced in interpretations of Southern Plains prehistory.

INTRODUCTION

After 80 years of investigations, evaluation of the sites and archeological
resources of the Buried City of the Texas Panhandle and its surrounding area is
definitely in order. This locality is the site of the earliest documented archeological
excavations in Texas (Eyerly 1907; see Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1986). For 10
days in the summer of 1987, and again in 1988, more than 300 members of the Texas
Archeological Society (TAS) participated in the excavation of six prehistoric
village-period sites, test excavations of two areas on another site, archeological
survey of several square miles of the Wolf Creek valley, and salvage of a Pleistocene
mammoth that was eroding into a tributary of Wolf Creek.
The three major expeditions to the Buffed City before the inception in 1985 of
the Courson Archeological Projects were directed by T. L. Eyerly in 1907 (Figure
1), Warren King Moorehead in 1917, 1919, and 1920 (Moorehead, 1931), and
Thomas S. Ellzey (1966).
The activities of the previous investigators, interested laymen, and vandals
seriously disturbed some of the ruins. Today, dimensions and orientation of the
individual houses cannot be determined from surface inspection alone. One of the
goals of all investigations so far has been to determine the extent of damage and loss
of information from these sites. For this report, rather than making an attempt at a

comprehensive review of the nature of the whole complex of prehistoric slxuctures
and villages, the author will endeavor to provide the flavor of the local settlement
system and to offer some details about the areas that have been investigated since
1985.
The Sites
There are five major groups of sites on the Courson ranch and at least two kinds
of ancillary activity sites beyond the houses (Figure 2). The first, and best known
of the site groups is the Buried City proper, defined by T. L. Eyerly in 1907 and
renamed in error the Ilandley (a misspelling of the landowner’s name) ruins by
Moorehead (1931) in honor of Sam Handly, the owner of the property. Directly to

the west of the Buried City are the Courson ruins, the focus of most of the Courson
Archeological Projects and the TAS Field School efforts (Figure 3). North of the
Courson ruins, on the north side of Wolf Creek, is a newly rediscovered area, here
named the Moorehead ruins in honor of Professor Warren King Moorehead, whose
original field map found during background research for the 1985 investigations led
to their identification. West of the Moorehead ruins on the north side of Wolf Creek
are the Kirk Courson ruins. West of these and south of Wolf Creek are the Kit
Courson ruins, an area studied during the 1986 and 1987 Courson Archeological
Projects and in 1987 and 1988 by the TAS Field School. Still more sites upstream
from the Courson ranch await further study.

The subdivision of the locality into these groups of sites is based both on
physiography and the distribution of cultural materials. Each group has five or more
prehistoric house sites that date from the middle to late Village periods. Distance
between structures within any given group is substantially less than the distance
between any two or more adjacent groups. In addition to the houses, each set appears
to have many external activity areas for tasks relating to the daily lives of the
occupants. Evidence from the Buried City and the Courson ruins suggests a separate
cemetery at each locality. All localities have earlier occupations, but only on the
Courson ruins has sufficient information been obtained to suggest continuity from
Woodland time into the Village period.

Ancillary activity sites beyond the structure and house sites include caim
burials (of undetermined antiquity) on the promontories above the sites, crevice or
overhang burials in the bluffs along the valley margin, and probable occupied bluff
shelters and overhangs. No direct evidence of bison jumps, lithic workshops, or
other activities has been found yet on the Courson ranch.
The Buried City
Eyerly published four major reports on his investigations ~yerly 1907a,
1907b, 1910, and 1912). The first of these (1907a) is the source for much of the
following discussion. "The place has been known as ’The Buried City’ so long that
the appellation is retained... [and] the place has been visited by a number of
scientists and a superficial examination of the ruins made a number of times"
(Eyerly 1907a:29). Within the 70-acre area Eyerly defined as the Buffed City, he
noted that there were 12 mounds, that some of the mounds were about .61 meters
(2 feet) above the surface, and that on each it "is easy to distinguish the outline of
an enclosure made of stone" (Eyerly 1907a:30). In addition to the 12 mounds in the
Buried City, Eyerly noted a circular mound about 7.5 meters (25 feet) in diameter
on the butte south of the Buried City.
The key structure in the catalog of prior investigations is the large, rectangular
structure known locally as the "Temple" at the turn of this century and so identified
by Eyerly (1907:33). Additional sites were found west of the Buried City (marked
C on Eyerly’s map). On the north side of the creek are "indications of an Indian
village.., and the adjacent ground cultivated .... Parts of tepee poles, in a state of
fair preservation lie abut the field" ~yerly 1907:34). Eyerly concluded his
presentation by arguing that the stone enclosures along Wolf Creek are not the
remains of a village or of houses but that they were established solely for burial.
Ten years after the Eyerly investigations were first published, Warren King
Moorehead, of The Robert S. Peabody Foundation of the Phillips Academy at
Andover, Massachusetts, contracted with Fred H. Stems, then a recent Harvard
graduate, to visit the Buried City as part of a survey of the Arkansas River Valley
under Moorehead’s general direction (Moorehead 1920, 1931). The three Phillips
Academy expeditions in 1917, 1919, and 1920, were fraught with interpersonal and
procedural difficulties. Some reconstruction of the events of those expeditions has
been attempted (see Hughes and Hughes-Jones, 1987).
The Andover Academy expeditions identified 12 houses and tested or excavated
at least six of them. Because of the difficulties with the Moorehead expeditions and
records, there are several important points of confusion that may never be adequately
clarified. First, and most important to placing the Courson Archeological Projects
and TAS Field Schools in perspective, is the question of the Bluff No. I ruin
identified by Moorehead as being 180 meters (600 feet) southeast of the Franklin
ruin (Moorehead 1931:103) and shown in the extreme left of his Figure 30 (a
photograph purportedly showing "the plain where the Handley ruins lie"). A
rephotograph of Moorehead’s Figure 30 shows that the promontory on the extreme
left of that photograph is in fact the location of site Courson A, 41OC26 (Hughes

112

Texas Archeological Society

and Hughes-Jones 1987:Figure 7). The problem is that this location is more than .8
km (half a mile) west of the probable Franklin site; not 180 meters (600 feet)
southeast as Moorehead indicates. Except for the location, the bulk of the description
of Bluff No. 1 ruin (Moorehead 1931:103) adequately describes site Courson A.
Despite these difficulties, some agreements between Eyerly’s and Moorhead’s
studies can be found. The unusual size of Moorehead’s Gould ruin clearly shows it
to be the same as Eyerly’s Temple or ruin No. 10.
Moorehead concluded his observations about the Handley ruins (Buried City)
by suggesting that

because of the peculiarities here in evidence that this small and picturesque
plain may be justly considered one of the strategic centers in American
archaeology. Apparently all agree that the remains are not Pueblo. Admitting this, yet it is a distinct departure from the ordinary Plains or buffalo
culture, as we understand the term [Moorehead 1931:106].
In his 1920 field report, Moorehead concluded that these people may have been
the ancestors of the Pueblo cliff dweller people (Moorehead 1920:8), a conclusion
attested to by the stone marker that still stands on the site of the Moorehead
excavations.
For 50 years after the Phillips Academy expeditions, no visits to the Buried City
were reported or published. In 1966, Thomas S. Ellzey, the son of a local rancher,
returned from his studies in anthropology at the University of Texas and undertook
test excavations at a midden in the Buried City (41OC4) and at the Eyedy ruin
(41OC3). Ellzey’s excavations included the eastem half of the north wall and the
east wall of the Eyerly ruin. The east wall of the house was about .61 meters (2 feet)
thick and averaged as much as .75 meters (2.5 feet) in height (Ellzey 1966:61). A
large hearth was found in the gap [entryway?] in the east wall but was destroyed by
vandals before it could be fully traced. Vandalism of the excavations and severe
weather forced Ellzey to abandon the excavations before he could obtain more
information about the structure. Ellzey’s conclusions offer yet a different interpretation of the sites, that was more in keeping with then current knowledge about
Texas Panhandle cultures.
From the evidence it is rather conclusive that we are dealing with
plains influence. The decorations of the pottery from the midden especially indicates this influence (Wedel 1959). The architecture indicates a
Pueblo influence, but this seems to be emphasized less in the other cultural
remains. It is my opinion that at this site we are dealing with a Plains people
who had come into contact with a culture, probably the Puebloans, from
which they learned the trait of stone architecture [Ellzey 1966:64-65].
Throughout the 80 years of known investigations on the Buried City, several
of the archeological sites were reported to the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, andwere assigned trinomial site
numbers by that agency. The Buried City proper became site 410C 1. Part of the site

Hughes--TAS Buried City Field Schools

113

is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Within 41OC1 are sites 41 OC2,
41OC3, and 41OC4. A revision of the site numbers was suggested in 1986, to
include seventeen subareas, identified as 41OC1-A through 41OC1-Q, to replace
existing and previous nomenclature and site numbers.
Courson Ruins (4IOC26, 27, 28, 29)
These sites are west of and across a broad ravine from the Buried City (Figure
4). Eyerly (1907a) discussed them as Area C, Moorehead (1931) as ruins V, VI, and
VII (and possibly Bluff No. 1, see above). Four primary archeological sites have
been defined here: 41OC26 (site Courson A), 41OC27 (site Courson B), 41OC28
(site Courson C), and 41OC29 (site Courson D). Each of these comprises one or
more houses and is separated from others within the group by topographic breaks
and by an apparent thinning of cultural debris between the sites. Each is on a distinct
elevation or ridge adjacent to one of the shallow swales that run through the locality.
Most of the sites are obscured by recent accumulations of eolian silts and sands.
Courson A (41OC26) is on the west side of a caliche-capped knoll at the
northwest limit of the Courson ruins. It has been largely destroyed by erosion, or
possibly by earlier excavation.
Courson B (41OC27) is south of Courson A on a promontory that is being cut
by Wolf Creek and an arroyo that drains into Wolf Creek. Moorehead’s ruin V may
be the same as Courson B. East of Courson B is site Courson C (41OC28),
apparently a single large house. Courson C may be Moorehead’s ruin VI.
On a knoll east of Courson A and north of Courson C is site Courson D
(41OC29). Courson D may have five or more house sites. Moorehead’s ruin VII
may be the same as the main Courson D structure excavated by the TAS in 1987 and
1988.
The Courson ruins have been the focus of much of the activity for the 1985
through 1988 investigations. The sites are similar in age and content to those of the
Buffed City proper. The Courson ruins may represent a separate contemporaneous
community or a slightly different period of occupation of the valley by the same
people who built and lived in the Buffed City.
Moorehead Ruins (410C46)
The Moorehead ruins lie north of and across Wolf Creek from the Courson
ruins on an elevated floodplain of the creek. The sites were first identified during
the 1986 field season and were further recorded by the TAS in 1987. The entire area
has been assigned site number 41OC46. It encompasses the remains of three, or
possibly, four house sites, which are almost completely obscured by deep accumulations of modem alluvium and eolian silts and sands that prevent more information
from being obtained without intensive field investigations. The limited number of
artifacts and debris found on the surface suggest contemporaneity with the Courson
ruins and the Buried City proper.

Kirk Courson Ruins (410C47, 410C48)

The Kirk Courson ruins are adjacent and to the west of the Moorehead ruins,
north of Wolf Creek, on the inside of Horseshoe Bend, on a second terrace of the
creek. The location is topographically identical to the setting of the Moorehead ruins
and is separated from them by a small arroyo. At least two discrete areas have been
identified and assigned site numbers 41OC47 and 41 OC48. Site 41 OC47 is west of
the Moorehead ruins across a small south-draining wash and 10 meters north of the
eroding bank of Wolf Creek. The site is a single structure on a low promontory; one
east-west-trending line of stones more than 7 meters long is barely visible on the
surface. No other walls of the structure are visible. No midden debris or features that
could be useful in identifying additional sites or components show in the creek bank
at this point. Although site 41OC47 is geographically midway between the
Moorehead and Kirk Courson ruins, it is included here because of its topographic
similarity to the Kirk Courson nfins.
Site 41OC48 of the Kirk Courson ruins is a large area on the second terrace that
almost certainly comprises remains of several houses. It is completely obscured by
modern soil mantle; disturbance from rodent activity and farm improvements have
limited the surface expression, but three probable house sites and a possible
cemetery complex have been identified. Artifacts recovered from excavations for
a water well indicate that this site is generally contemporaneous with the others. In
addition to the Plains Village components, the recovery of a Deadman point and
scoria-tempered pottery suggest a Woodland component in the roughly 1.5 meters
of deposit. Because so little information is available for the Kirk Courson ruins, no
precise subdivision of the site(s) into separate structural sites or areas can be made
at this time.
Kit Courson Ruins (410C40, 41, 43, 51)

The Kit Courson ruins (named in honor of Harold Courson’s father) is the
westernmost group of sites on the Courson ranch. It occupies the second and third
terraces of Wolf Creek, and, like the Courson ruins, it consists of sites and structures
on elevations surrounding low swales that run through the complex. Five distinct
areas have been identified within the Kit Courson ruins: site 41OC40 is at the
northeast end of the locality on a ridgelike projection of the second terrace. Sites
41OC41 and 41OC42 occupy the northwest and southeast ends, respectively, of a
long, low ridge projecting northwestward from the bluffs into the Wolf Creek
valley, and sites 41OC43 and 41OC51 are on the east edge of the second terrace,
separated by a low swale. This complex includes at least four house sites and several
middens and related habitation features.
Excavations at 41OC43 and 41OC51 by the 1986 Courson Archeological
Projects and the 1987 and 1988 TAS Field Schools indicated contemporaneity
between these sites and the others. In 1987, a TAS survey crew led by Emmett Shedd
located a house 100 meters southeast of the main Kit Courson site. They recorded
chert flakes and cores, a potsherd, mussel shell, marine shell, burned limestone, and

116

quartzite flakes from the vicinity of the house. This part of 41OC43 measures 35
meters east to west and 80 meters north to south. As with the Kirk Courson and
Moorehead ruins, a complete evaluation of the structural remains and probable
contents of these sites will require a substantial field investigation because of the
modem silt mantle that obscures most of the remains.
EXCAVATIONS

The Courson Archeological Projects and the TAS work of 1987 and 1988
approached these sites with several specific goals. At Courson A (41 OC26), testing
in 1985 disclosed a trash-filled pit and a dense ceramic scatter. One of the goals of
the TAS was to identify the nature of the ceramic scatter and evaluate the remaining
contents of the site.
At Courson B (41OC27), 1985 and 1986 explorations defined deep and
extensive deposits. The TAS sought to delimit the vertical and horizontal boundaries of the site, to identify the specific components, and to find exterior activity areas
related to the prehistoric houses. Since Courson C had been badly damaged by relic
collectors, our primary goal with the TAS was to determine the condition of the site,
delimit it, and obtain information on the distribution of cultural material.
Investigations at the fourth area, the Courson D site (41OC51), began in 1987
with the evaluation of a disturbed prehistoric house in Area A and the securing of
a controlled surface collection from Area D. In 1988 we added test excavations of
a large area (Area B) north of the main structure where there might be additional
structural and nonstructural features. Area C was set aside for test excavations to
evaluate possible damage from farm improvements.
At the Kit Courson site, the 1986 excavations exposed a large, well-preserved
house that contained several clearly defined activity areas but no indication of an
adjacent midden. The goals of the TAS were to excavate around the house to locate
exterior activity areas, midden, and dump area, and, if possible, find additional
earlier or later components.
The final prehistoric cultural site excavated by the TAS was the Temple (Eyerly
1907a) or Gould ruin (Moorehead 1920, 1931), site 41OC1, Area A. Because this
unusually large structure had been so thoroughly excavated by virtually all previous
visitors, the only goal for beginning the 1988 excavation was to evaluate the
condition of the site and identify the nature and extent of the previous excavations.
In addition to the sw~ific excavation goals of the project, TAS survey crews
went out to gather information on other sites in the vicinity in order to place these
sites in local perspective. As part of the 1987 investigation, an extensive survey of
much of the Wolf Creek valley upstream from the Courson ranch was undertaken.
The final episode of activities at the TAS Field Schools was the salvage of a
Pleistocene mammoth on the Dutcher ranch, a few kilometers below the Wolf Creek
Park.
One of the perpetual problems in presenting summary results of such an
extensive series of excavations is how to provide the most information in the least

HugheswTAS Buried City Field Schools

117

space. In the following discussions related to distribution of artifacts, a series of
charts showing frequencies of different classes of artifacts and debris are offered in
the form of contour maps (Figures 6-9, 13b, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20). These maps were
prepared with the aid of the SURFERc system and related series of routines using
data from the catalog database of the project.
A few special cautions are in order about reading the plots. First, the numbers
plotted are the "raw" quantities or weights of material. No allowance has been made
at this stage for variations caused by depth of deposit, cultural features, or other
factors. Second, in areas beyond excavations the software that created the plots used
the best information from surrounding areas to predict the probable amounts of
material present. The results are useful for providing information on the gross nature
of the findings and tell much about the horizontal distribution of material across the
sites.
Courson A (41OC26)
On Courson A was what may be one of the earlier houses in the Texas
Panhandle, dating to or before about A.D. 1200 (Figure 5). An attempt to secure an
archaeomagnetic date was inconclusive, perhaps because magnetic alignments
have been disturbed by slumping of the point on which the site is situated (Jeff
Eighmy, personal communication, 1988). A 1985 radiocarbon date from an
associated feature yielded an uncorrected date of A.D. 1210&50 (DIC-3281).
Samples from the 1988 investigations were submitted to Beta Analytic in fall 1990,
but results have not yet been returned.
There is excellent evidence for identification of activities in and around the
house (Figure 6). Mussel shell is distributed throughout the interior area of the
house, which is otherwise relatively clean of debris (Figure 6, a). The Courson A
house is square with a central firepit, southeast entryway, post wall, and an
unplastered floor; all of these make the outline irregular and difficult to interpret.
Two trash or cache pits were found; Pit 1, found and partially tested in 1985 and
excavated completely in 1987, yielded charred corn, a canid maxilla, and Toyahlike arrowpoints, together with Fresno points or preforms. There was very little bone
or debris in the pit, but a substantial amount of daub suggests that it had been
backfilled. Pit 2 was found in 1988 at the end of the field school; the sample of its
contents, from an arcuate area about 20 cm in diameter truncated east and south,
yielded substantial amounts of debris, including most of the bison bone found on the
site. There may be an adult male burial in the unexcavated part of the pit.
Comparison of this map with the plan of Courson A (Figure 5) shows that in
addition to recognizable peaks of material from Pits 1 and 2, there are two main areas
of increased material concentration in the vicinity of the house (Figure 6, b). One
is south and southeast of the house in squares 21-23E/20-21N. The other is in
squares 19E/21-24N. Square 31N/23E yielded an unusually high concentration of
artifacts and debris, none of which is directly associated with the house and hearth
but all of which seems to relate to ancillary or later activities.

The discrete patterning of bone in relation to the two pits--very little bone next
to Pit 1 and quite a bit at Pit 2 suggests either functional or temporal differences;
the latter may be likely. There is also a substantial increase of bone and burned
rock--the only material found in this region in any concentration---on the northern
end of the site associated with Feature 88-5 (Figure 6, c). There are several
anomalous post molds west of the house that may be more closely associated with
the scoria-tempered pot. Since this is where most of the daubing is, perhaps the post
holes represent an earlier house that the square house (Figure 5) cut through during
construction.
Although daub (Figure 6, d) was found over much of the site, the greatest
concentration was found in 23N/17E, near the broken pot. Daubing does not seem
to be associated with the square house. Bone debris that is not from Pit 2 seems to
be located mainly south of the house; more is on top of the hill at the extreme north
end of the site. There is very little bone debris from Pit 1 and little from inside and
around the house. Mussel shell, on the other hand, is predominantly inside the house
around the hearth, and there is some in the southwest and southeast grid quadrants
of the site. Little or no shell came from the northern tests, suggesting that shell and
bone mark two functionally different sets of activities. The shell may have come
from food preparation or consumption or it may be fragments of ornaments.
Except for the dense concentration surrounding the broken pot in 23N/18E,
pottery is extremely scarce. There is a slight increase in pottery sherds north and
south of the presumed entryway of the house. Flakes are distributed irregularly
across the site; the greatest concentrations are south and east of the house, with a
slight increase in flakes just north of the hearth. Square 31N/23E yielded only flakes,
but in relatively high concentration. Pit 1 yielded substantially fewer flakes than the
surrounding sheet midden, suggesting that the pit was not filled with general
habitation debris.
Courson B (41OC27)
At the Courson B site--the most complex site we have dealt with--several
series of occupations are represented (Figure 7). They begin at or near the same time
as the Courson A house, perhaps early in the current millennium. Excavations in
1985 and 1986 showed a basic architectural sequence beginning with a small,
roughly circular pit that may represent a pithouse with a central hearth but no
evidence of wall posts. This was overlain by the main Courson B house, which was
about 8 meters square, inside the nearly 1-meter-thick stone wall bases. The main
house had a long, extended east entryway, four primary support posts with two
auxiliary support posts, and the central one-third of the floor surrounding the
prepared, cylindrical fire pit was lowered. Following abandonment and filling-in of
the main house, a small, stone-outlined house, apparently with a wall-gap entry and
post walls with stone bases was built over the filled main house area. The work of
the 1987 and 1988 TAS Field School investigations uncovered evidence of an
isolated hearth south of the main site area that could represent another prehistoric
house in the same style as the Courson A house, but there was no evidence of posts

HughesmTAS Buried City Field Schools

121

or other structural features to support this interpretation. Additionally, the testing of
the Courson B site yielded many small areas that appeared to be plaster or fragments
of architectural features, indicating that there has been a complex history here of
construction, reconstruction, and abandonment.

Two trash or cache pits were excavated in 1985 and 1986 by the Courson
Archeological Projects, and several others were identified. One of these, which was
more thoroughly investigated by the TAS Field Schools in 1987 and 1988, turned
out to be at least three interlocking pits. All of the pits identified to date on this site
appear to be roughly cylindrical, about 1 meter in diameter, and about a meter or
slightly less deep. Much of the TAS effort focused on an area directly south of the
main Courson B house that may be a large area of interlocking trash/cache pits, an
early structure, a large borrow area backfilled with trash, or some other kind of
expedient or constructed feature. Some unusual aspects of all of the pits in the main
structure of the Courson B site seem to predate the construction of the large house,
and in almost all cases the pit fills were relatively sterile, containing some bone and
mussel shell and large quantities of daub, but otherwise often having less cultural
debris than the surrounding thinner areas of sheet midden. The 1988 TAS investigations at Courson B did detect south of the main house a distinct area of sheet
midden that comes to an abrupt end some 20 meters south of the house. This midden
varies in thickness and in it there may be one or more other structures or related
features from time periods earlier or later than that of the main house. An additional
concentration of midden debris was found northeast of the house, apparently along
the swale margin northeast of the house entryway.
The final event at the Courson B site was identified in the 1986 Courson
Archeological Project and consisted of reuse of rocks and other structural elements
from the houses for the construction of a cairn over what appears to be a mass burial
of at least five individuals: four adults and one juvenile (Hughes and Hughes-Jones,
1986). The skeletons were in various orientations, and, although there were no
obvious grave goods or funerary offerings with any of the adults, a stone pendant
was found with the juvenile.
The heaviest density of material on the Courson B site is from the interlocking
trash-filled pits beneath the south wall of the main house and from the pit directly
west of them (Figure 8, a). Most of this material, whether by weight or by count, is
bone--principally Bison bone--and daubing. Northeast of the house a sharp
increase in density of material suggest midden debris. South of the house another
increase in density of material suggests a trash area rather than merely a sheet
midden or another residence, but the distribution here is more diffuse, covering an
area of perhaps 20 square meters; it is not a point source, as are the other trash-filled
pitlike features. There is no special accumulation of trash that could indicate the
house, but distribution maps for specific classes of artifacts suggest that the
distribution of burned rocks differs obviously from the distribution pattern of
general debris. The concentrations of pottery (Figure 8, b), bone (Figure 9, a), daub
(Figure 9, b), and shell (Figure 9, c) coincide with the trash-filled pits and midden
areas. Burned rock (Figure 9, d) follows the same pattern except for a substantial
increase in burned rock directly southeast of the main entry of the house. These
burned rocks, even though they are principally caliche, may be boiling pebbles-stones heated for use for secondary wanning of other substances. Caliche pebbles
seem to bear up well when used for stone boiling of water, with only a slightly lower
thermal efficiency than other rock.

Courson C (41OC28)

The condition of 41OC28, the Courson C site ~igure 10), was at best
disappointing. The work was remarkably unproductive of artifacts and debris. The
very deep but filled pothunter trench that crosses from north to south through the
center of the site could be one of the later excavations that we have only hints of (e.g.
Studer or efficient local people) and may well be screened backfill. Although all of
the houses were characterized by lower concentrations of debris within their walls,
this house yielded the least material. Material densities were so low that contour
plots of density here are meaningless. Concentrations of bone, shell, and flakes at
about 47N/190E could reflect either residuum from activity areas or a screen dump
from a previous excavator.
An unusual feature recorded in profile during the 1988 excavations was a
double depression in the subsoil suggestive of two parallel trenches beneath the
rocks that may have marked the northernmost wall of the suspected house. A
virtually identical feature was later seen beneath the north wall of 41OC29 and may
give us an important clue to how many of these houses were built. The possibility
of a double-post wall has been offered for the primary house construction (D.
Hughes, in press). It is conceivable that a wide, deep trench was dug to outline the

construction site, followed by a double picket of posts set 50 cm to 80 cm apart. The
trench was then backfilled, and rocks were set on top to keep the poles from pulling
in while the pickets were woven into a pair of parallel wickerwork walls. This would
explain the double postmolds, the erratic placement of rocks, their lack of association with the house floor, and the double wall trench; the edges of the trench would
have been dug deeper to accommodate the posts, but the center would have been
scooped out only enough to make excavation easier.

Courson D (41OC29)

Three distinct areas of Courson D, site 41 OC29, were investigated by the TAS
field schools (Figure 11). These investigations included controlled surface collections, broad-area testing, evaluation of a disturbed house site, and evaluation of an
area disturbed for the drilling of a water well. Area A, the disturbed house (Figure
12), was the focus of most of our activities for the two seasons.
The house site apparently had suffered rather severely from previous digging.
Upon reviewing the notes and records of the work, it is apparent that some of the
digging may have been undertaken as part of prehistoric remodelling of the house.
The central hearth, found in 1988, was not the kind of fire pit the other houses have,
but was rather a flat surface of extensively burned soil that appeared to have been
planed smooth. Evidence from confusing possible wall alignments has lead the
author to believe that this house may have gone through several stages of remodelling or reconstruction, and that each new phase of the process began with new
excavations inside the structure. The little evidence of interior features other than
the hearth suggests that the house probably conformed, at least in broad outline, to
the large stone-based houses at Courson B and the Kit Courson site. A rock pile in
the southeast corner of the house was thought to be a burial cairn like the one at
Courson B, but exploration of the pile revealed no graves, and, in retrospect, this
particular rock pile is more than likely a discard pile left by some previous but
historic digger at the site who left only the traces in the soil to record his passage.
No pit features or other ancillary features were found during our investigations here.
Areas A and C (Figure 13, a) are nearly contiguous, and a plot of materials from
both ~igure 13, b) clearly shows a difference in the densities of material between
the two areas, suggesting that they supported different activities.
In Area A, two distinct concentrations of material are apparent in the overall
pattern of material recovered (See Figure 14, a). The first and greatest concentration
is in the south center of the house where a deep north-south trench was cut to the
house floor. The second appears to be just southeast of the entryway. Both of the
concentrations are caused primarily by the bone and, near the hearth, burned bone
recoveries (Figure 14, b). Leaving those out of the analysis, several other discrete
increases in material are apparent. In the north and northwest quadrant of the house
is the greatest density of flakes (Figure 14, c) except for a small accumulation just
south of the center of the east wall, suggesting that the first concentration may reflect
some kind of interior activity and the second concentration may reflect an exterior
activity. Shell distribution here, as on the other sites, appears to have its own unique
distribution, with concentrations in the center of the east wall, roughly in line with
the probable entryway and another main concentration in the center of the south half
of the house, just south of the hearth. The quadrant of the site directly southeast of
the structure is relatively free of trash and debris, as if this area had been left
intentionally trash free or had been periodically cleaned.
Testing in area B, the north and east flanks of the hill that is Courson D ~igure
15), yielded one child burial, which was first thought to represent a cemetery
because fragments of human skull were found over an area of roughly 400 square

meters. However, forensic anthropologists at the Wichita State University, who
examined the fragments, suggested that all of the skull fragments could have come
from the same individual, a juvenile in the 8-to-10-year age range. There were no
offerings or direct associations that could be useful for inferring a date for this burial,
and because there had been rodent disturbance in the grave pit, all charcoal at the
level of the skeleton is suspect, so no definite age can be assigned to it. Other testing
disclosed a possible additional house area at the east center of the main Courson D
hill.
Test excavations in Area C showed one substantial concentration of material
at the southern edge of the test block (Figure 16). However, this concentration may
be material moved in by rodents or other burrowing animals from a nearby trashfilled pit that was damaged or destroyed in preparation for drilling the water well
and putting it in service.
Surface collections from the Courson D site yielded several areas of material
concentration. The greatest concentrations are on the southwest and east slopes of
the hill; there is relatively little material on the hill crest (Figure 17). Several

the midden and activity areas associated with the main structure (Figure 18). The
primary goal of the TAS--to identify the midden area for this structure--was
clearly achieved. A substantial deposit of midden debris was found east of the house,
bounded by grid coordinates from 39E to 46E and from 30N to 42N. There is a
distinct decline in trash and debris that forms a buffer zone about 4 meters wide
between the house and this midden area (Figure 19, a). Concentrations of shell seem,
as at the other sites, to mark a special activity that is distinct from the routine
household processing tasks (Figure 19, b). Daubing is distributed in a tight cluster
well separated from the main house, suggesting a second house southeast of the one
already studied (Figure 19, c). The distribution of flake debris presents a similar
picture (Figure 20, a); the midden reaches its greatest density between 8 and 15

meters east of the house. There is a small amount of charcoal distributed to the
northeast of the doorway and around the hearth ~igure 20, b).
A relatively complete description of the Kit Courson house has already been
published (Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987). The house is similar to those described
above, measuring some 9 meters east to west and 7 meters north to south, inside the
50-cm-to-1-meter-thick walls ~igure 21). The entryway was not stone lined, but a
distinct compaction of the soil and an opening in the rock in the center of the east
wall clearly marked its beginning. The compact soil of the entry floor could be
traced for slightly more than 2 meters before it became indistinguishable from the
other soils in the area. The house had a central firepit about 45 cm in diameter, four
deep primary support posts that were as much as 50 cm in diameter, and plastered
faces on the raised north, south, and west benches. In addition, it was suspected that
there was a series of small post molds on each side of the rock wall bases that
surrounded the house. The post molds were identified in 1986 by probing, and the
regularity of their pattern and the few that could be traced lend credence to the theory
that the rocks at this house served as footing or foundation stones at the base of a
double-pen wicker wall with vertical uprights.
Attached to the south wall of the house, and extending beyond its southeast
corner, was a small, lightly constructed addition of posts and rocks that had its own
clay-lined central firepit and appears to have had relatively clean floors except for
parts of two broken pots found inside the west edge of this structure. Between the
north wall of this addition, which was made by extending the south wall of the main
house, and the extended entryway of the main house, was a distinctive exterior

activity area for food and material processing (Figure 22). The area yielded several
grinding stones, several deer antler tines, a large part of one complete antler, halves
of two different pots, and a deer-jaw sickle.
Test excavations by the TAS east of the house disclosed several discrete areas
of material concentration including the midden area discussed above. Billy Harrison,
site supervisor for this part of the work, believes that there may be a Woodland
pithouse southeast of the main house at Kit Courson.
Dutcher Mammoth (P404)

The TAS began salvaging the Dutcher Mammoth in 1988, and the work was
completed by volunteers and members of the Courson Archeological Projects later
in that season. Part of the skull and much of the postcranial material from one
mammoth, including pelvis, femorae, one tibia, and two humeri were recovered,
together with one tusk and an assortment of vertebrae and ribs (Figure 23). During
the excavations, evidence of additional riverine deposits of gravel, coarse sediments,

and reworked Pleistocene fossils were found to be mixed in with the mammoth
remains. This could indicate a pluvial event after burial of the carcass had begun,
perhaps a terminal Wisconsin event. No artifacts or evidence of human activity were
found with the remains, and no estimate of the age of the mammoth’s death can be
offered at this time. The bones are being restored by employees of Courson Oil and
Gas in Perryton for interpretive display.
Temple, or Gould, Ruin (41OC1:A)
The final area of primary investigations by the TAS was at site 41OC 1, Area
A (41OC1A), known variously as the Temple (Eyerly 1907a, 1907b, 1910, 1912)
or the Gould ruin (Moorehead 1920, 1931). The TAS exposed the west wall and
tried to find the northeast and southeast comers in order to define the limits of the
structure. These investigations were undertaken despite many excavations of this
structure since 1907 because none of the records of previous work included an

adequate map of the building layout or contents. Conflicts in publications and field
notes made even the rough dimensions questionable. However, the TAS found
several floor features in good condition
Post molds lined the inside of both the east and west walls about 50 cm from
the base of the rocks. These may represent structural wall posts along the inner
margins of a stone foundation. The main cross trench encountered one of two large
central support posts and part of a small hearth near the center of the excavation that
probably was one of the firepits in use when the building was occupied. Also
exposed in the cross trench were a Irash or cache pit southeast of the small hearth
and the clearly defined trench Moorehead excavated in 1920 from north to south
through the center of the structure. Jeff Eighmy, from Colorado State University,
secured an archaeomagnetic dating sample from the clay rim of the firepit that was
exposed in 1988. The results suggest an age for the firepit of from A.D. 1250 to 1375
(personal communication, J. Eighmy 1990).

area southeast of the entryway to the house.

At the end of the brief excavations in 1988, several important questions were
left unanswered. The north and south walls had not been clearly defined, but enough
information was obtained to support an educated guess about the north wall; the
south wall was still a complete question. Excavations within the walls suggested
that enough structural features might be found to make it possible to deal with
several important questions about the house. Among these are

1) Is this a single, open-room structure, or was it subdivided into several
rooms?
2) Is this in fact a single structure or could it be two (or more) closely
spaced structures that have been considered a large single structure
through accidents and interpretations of previous excavations or site
development processes?
3) Does this structure reflect an initiation or termination of the locally
defined culture--the Buried City Complex? Or does it reflect another
facet of the primary cultural development?
To answer these questions and several others, the Wichita State University field
school was held at the Temple site in the Summer of 1990. Although analysis is still
in progress on the results, the field map and tentative interpretations conclude that
this is in fact a single structure, probably a large open room without partitions, and
that it had three firepits, a large central fire pit almost 1 meter in diameter, an
auxiliary firepit in the center of the south half of the building (identified by the TAS

as noted above), and probably another auxiliary firepit in the northern half of the
structure (alluded to in Moorehead’s field notes). The north wall was found to run
at an oblique angle from the west wall, giving the structure a rather unusual shape,
and the south wall was still not found. However, detailed examination of the
southern part of the site, together with study of the vertical and horizontal
distribution of material, indicate that the wall may have been in about the position
shown on the map (Figure 24).
Of continuing interest is what may have happened to the south wall. A close
examination of Moorehead’s published and field photographs from the 1990
investigations suggest that there was no south wall when Moorehead dug here, and
there is every indication that it had been removed in prehistory, or perhaps never
existed. More details about the conclusions from the Temple ruin investigations will
be included in a report planned for completion in spring 1991.
OTHER TASKS
The extensive archeological survey conducted in 1987 discovered many sites
directly upstream from the Buried City, but the main group of sites and village
material does not extend more than a few kilometers upstream from the Courson

ranch. One of the questions addressed during the survey was whether settlement was
restricted to the main valley of Wolf Creek or there are components in the tributary
valleys that have not been found. No such other components were found during the
survey in 1987 or during subsequent investigations in 1988, 1989, and 1990. For
some reason, the major settlement pattern seems to have focused on the main
drainage of Wolf Creek.
Many isolated sites and nonarchitectural sites--beyond the defined site groups-have been found and recorded during the past 80 years; information on these sites
was expanded by the Courson Archeological Projects and the TAS survey. Included
here as miscellaneous sites are one site of undetermined function (41 OC5), two rock
overhangs that may have had some limited prehistoric occupations, one possible
crevice or overhang burial, one possible disturbed crevice or overhang burial, and
three cairns, possibly for burials on the valley rim. Several other likely overhangs
for bluff shelters were identified by the TAS survey crews, but review of these sites
showed no direct evidence of occupation. In addition to these nonstructural sites,
one possible house site was found west of the Kit Courson ruins.
Two of the cairns identified were apparently burial cairns, as indicated by the
presence of some human bone in the disturbed fill around them. Both had been
excavated at some time in the past by persons unknown; age and cultural affiliation
of the cairn burials on the rim cannot be assessed from observations made at the sites.
No diagnostic artifacts or other remains were associated with the cairns. According
to Danny Witt (personal communication), one of the burials (possibly 41OC44) was
dug at some time during the past 30 years and may have yielded a flintlock and other
metal fittings, suggesting an early Historic or Protohistoric time for that site.
Southeast of the Buried City proper is an isolated promontory known locally
as "Lookout" or "Signal" Peak. The promontory is an ideal location for some kind
of special activity. Eyerly (1907) mentions this site as a burial ground, and
Moorehead refers to it but offers no information about it. In 1987 there were no
artifacts or other prehistoric debris on the clean caliche bedrock, but there were
substantial quantities of plaster of paris scrap were found there, together with
enough stone-work to indicate that something had been built there.
A series of late prehistoric or protohistoric sites is situated south of the Kirk
Courson sites on the second terrace of Wolf Creek. There is only minimal
archeological material in this area, shown by Eyerly as an old Indian camp where
he noted the presence of tepee poles. Local collectors have gathered several metal
arrowpoints from these sites through the years, adding some confidence to Eyerly’s
assessment of the site function and age.
To the west of the Kit Courson ruins, a long, bevelled projectile point or knife
reminiscent of the Meserve type projectile point was found eroding out of a wash
that flows into Wolf Creek. No additional material was found with this specimen to
suggest whether it represents terminal Paleoindian, Archaic, or some other time
period more closely related to the Village period sites that are so abundant.
A lithic scatter of chert flakes and burned pebbles was found by TAS survey
crews in a field about 6.5 km (4 miles) west of the Buried City. It is a small scatter

142

Texas Archeological Society

encompassing about 100 square meters on a low rise above a constructed pond.
Another lithic scatter that includes an arrowpoint is on upper Wolf Creek about 7
km (4.5 miles) west of the Buried City. This scatter encompasses some 750 square
meters and includes some burned caliche cobbles.
SUMMARY

Both the excavations and the surveys conducted by the TAS were extremely
successful and yielded important information on the archeology of this unique part
of the Wolf Creek valley. Research in the area is continuing, but several observations can be made from the information developed to date.
Site Distribution
All of the observed architectural sites or communities are above the first terrace
or active floodplain level of Wolf Creek. In the Buried City, Moorehead, Kirk
Courson, and Kit Courson ruins, the houses are more than 200 meters from the base
of the bluffs that line the Wolf Creek valley. Frequently, the houses were built on
the terrace margins or on the crests of the terraces near the terrace margins. The
Courson ruins has one house, Courson B (41OC27), relatively close to the bluffs and
two structures (Courson C and Courson D) well back from the terrace margin. The
latter structures are set on low rises adjacent to broad swales with almost level or Ushaped channel floors.
The general pattern throughout this small area is one of isolated, single-room
houses of about 64 square meters of floor space, situated on low knolls, rises, or
ridges adjacent to shallow swales that drain the flanks of the Caprock Escarpment.
In all cases, the houses are high enough to be well out of the floodplain of Wolf
Creek, but they are below the maximum elevations of the valley floor. Where
several structures are apparent on the surface, they seem to be at least 30 meters apart
and may be somewhat further apart. The primary controlling factor is probably
microtopographic variations in the valley floor. Despite very intensive survey work,
no indication of structures or related long-term habitation activities or features have
been found on any of the side channels entering Wolf Creek at the Buried City, and
upstream survey suggests that the structural sites do not extend more than 1.5 to 3
km (1 or 2 miles) upstream from the area that has been the focus of our study.
Information from local informants suggests that the main concentration of sites may
extend some 3 to 5 km (2 or 3 miles) downstream from the study area, and a study
of the Wolf Creek Park, adjacent to the Courson ranch, suggests equally high density
for at least 1.5 km (1 mile) below the Courson ranch (Ellzey 1985, 1987).
Time

The Courson ranch on Wolf Creek encompasses archeological sites representing time periods from at least the early Woodland through the late prehistoric
Village period and--perhaps with a hiatus during the terminal prehistoric--into the

protohistoric and Historic periods (Table 1). There is a possibility of Archaic
material, reflected by the Meserve-like point. Other time periods and events are
undoubtedly represented, but evidence of them is obscured by the recent soil
mantle; it will require an extensive geomorphic assessment to determine the age of
the land surfaces and test excavations to identify specific components.

Appraisal of Cultural Resources
This small part of the Wolf Creek valley is a truly unique archeological setting.
Site densities during the Late Prehistoric period are high enough that extensive
components of the cultural complex are found on every second and third terrace
setting for at least 1.5 km (1 mile) above the Buried City and for perhaps 3 km (2
miles) or more downstream. Despite this dense settlement, there is no indication of
such habitation on the side drainages of Wolf Creek, and there is little or no evidence
of even secondary activities associated with the primary habitations. Earlier
cultures, representing Woodland and earlier times, are poorly represented in all
samples, but this is because they have been obscured by rapid deposition in this part
of the Wolf Creek valley and the extensive mantling of the sites with the Village
period materials.
The Village period pottery recovered from these sites is particularly interesting;
perhaps the primary characteristic of Buffed City complex pottery is diversity
(Hughes and Hughes4ones 1987:104). Ceramics of most Panhandle sites are
tempered with crushed rock and are thin, hard, and simply cordmarked (Hughes,

144

Texas ArcheologicaI Society

1986:11); the ceramic tradition of the Courson ruins, however, is thick, poorly fired,
rounded, globular or subconoidal vessels tempered with fine to very fine quartz sand
(Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987). The neck, shoulder, and rim sherds show that
vessels frequently had high, slightly flaring rims. Body sherds of comprise about
equal proportions of smoothed ware (including manufactured plain wares) and
smoothed-over cordmarked wares, and cordmarked wares. Larger sherds normally
have additional surface treatments---chevron-incised plain and cordmarked wares,
crenelated, filleted, pinched, gouged, incised, punctated, and fluted rims, and many
other treatments (Figures 25 and 26). Virtually any surface treatment or rim
treatment imaginable can be found among the sherd collections from these simms.
Pottery types from these simms are closer to the Kansas Geneseo types than to other
Texas and Oklahoma Panhandle tytms (Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987:106).
The unusual character of this site complex may be largely the result of the
unique ecological setting of this part of the Wolf Creek valley. At the point where
the sites seem to begin on the upstream end of the valley, the creek has just begun
to cut through the Ogallala aquifer, and the house sites continue downstream until
the creek widens out and the Ogallala is mantled completely by silt and sand. Hence,
the area where most of the sites are found is the part of the creek where seeps and
springs from the Ogallala would have been most abundant. The probability is
excellent that the prehistoric levels of the aquifer would have kept the terrace
settings here subirrigated, providing optimum conditions for gardening and habitation as well as nourishing the abundant timber and other materials that were essential
to living on the Plains.
Such a dense concentration of village period sites is almost unknown in the
Texas Panhandle; some of the areas around Lake Meredith on the Canadian River
only approximate this settlement situation. However, several questions about the
individual sites need to be addressed, as do several questions about the internal
community structure within each site or village and the interactions between the
simms or villages. Because of the unusual setting, these sites should be considered
singly and together as of the utmost importance to our understanding of the local and
regional prehistory. The potential of these sites for answering questions about
prehistoric community structure and interactions, cultural growth and development, human response to environmental change, and the impact of low-technology
horticulturists on a strictly limited microniche is very high.
In order to address any of these questions, a long-term program of investigation
by a multidisciplinary team on several individual structures and nonstructural areas
on each site focusing on developing environmental data, precise chronological data,
and examination of cultural and aesthetic microevolutionary trends as reflected in
the stylistic attributes of the buildings, external activity areas, and artifacts will be
required. Because of the potential of these simms for helping to solve significant
archeological research questions and the possibility that the information developed
could help us understand the impact of modem low-technology fanning on
marginal environments, they are a resource that should be treasured and managed
with the greatest care.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

These investigations have been supported since 1985 materially, financially,
and with the labor and patience of the Courson family. Such a degree of personal
commitment in the current age is as refreshing as it is unusual, so I would like to
express a very special thanks to all of them for their deep concern with helping us
preserve and understand this small piece of the past. The Texas Archeological
Society provided some funding for the field seasons with them in the summers of
1987 and 1988. Trailers and heavy equipment were made available by Zenith
Drilling, and water wells and services were maintained by Howards Well Service.
The North Plains Electric Cooperative donated the use of a cherry picker for several

Hughes--TAS Buried City Field Schools

seasons to aid in the recording of the final excavations on many of the sites, and
laboratory space and facilities have been provided by the University of Oklahoma
Archaeological Research and ManagementCenter and The Wichita State University
Anthropology Laboratory.
Foremen for the early investigations included Nick Petruccione (1985) and Jim
Couzzourt (1986), who dutifully served as crew chiefs, records clerks, confidants,
and tour guides as needed. During the TAS investigations, the able involvement of
the various site archeologists including Doug Boyd, Jim Couzzourt, E. Mott Davis,
James Everett, Joan Few, Billy Harrison, Johnney Pollan, Ron Ralph, Emmett
Shedd, and Jim Word made the work not just go more smoothly; they made it
possible. Alicia Hughes-Jones devoted many long hours to helping develop the
recording, concordance, and analysis system that made this report possible. The
courageous efforts of several special expediters throughout the several seasons
work, including Greg Mason, Danny Witt, and Dee Fuchs, were seldom seen but
always felt, for their arduous duty was to insure that what was needed was present
in a timely manner. Danny Witt also served yeoman duty in setting up and closing
each season’s work and in maintaining the equipment between seasons.
The work reported here has spanned halfa decade and has involved perhaps as
many as 1,000 people in one capacity or another. To thank each individually would
require a more lengthy document than this report. The many names not listed here
represent the greatest contribution of all. I hope each of you who has been involved
will accept my personal thanks and debt of gratitude.
