ABSTRACT
Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC is planning to construct the LittmanPhillips Andrews 138-kV transmission line route in Andrews County, Texas.
Halff Associates, Inc., the routing consultant for Oncor, contracted with AR
Consultants, Inc. to conduct an intensive pedestrian survey of the 11.41-mile long
electric transmission line on private property. Initial evaluation of the project area
showed an overall moderate potential for encountering archaeological sites within
the transmission line route. No low probability areas were identified. Survey was
conducted June 18-20, 2018. Two shovel tests were excavated at an intermittent
drainage to test for buried deposits and five additional shovel tests were placed
along the route where ground visibility percentage was low. Two transects, each
16 ft (5 m) off the proposed centerline and 16 ft (5 m) from the ROW edge, were
walked within a 70-ft (21 m) survey corridor. The total area surveyed was
approximately 97 acres.
No cultural resources were encountered during survey, and AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that no additional cultural resources investigations are necessary for
this project. However, should the proposed right-of-way alignment change,
additional archaeological survey may be necessary. Furthermore, should any
cultural resources be discovered during the construction activities associated with the
project, work in the immediate area should cease and the Texas Historical
Commission should be contacted.

INTRODUCTION
Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC (Oncor) is planning to construct the Littman-Phillips
Andrews Tap 138-kV Transmission Line in Andrews County, Texas. They are proposing to
construct 11.41 miles (18.36 km) of new 138-kV electric transmission line (Figure 1). The route
is situated approximately 21 miles (34 km) northwest of Andrews, Texas. Starting on the west
end, the Littman-Phillips Andrews Tap route generally parallels the south side of SH176 for 2.6
miles (4.2 km) and then crosses to the northside of SH176 and parallels it for 5.3 mi (8.6 km),
also crossing an unnamed intermittent drainage and turning northeast away from the highway for
the eastern 2.6 miles (4.2 km). The west end of the Littman-Phillips Andrews Tap route will
connect to the Littman substation and the east end will connect to the existing Phillips Andrews
Tap. The transmission line route is to be constructed on private land. AR Consultants, Inc. was
contracted by Halff Associates, Inc., who is providing the environmental permitting for the
project, to conduct an intensive pedestrian survey of the route within the 70-ft-wide project rightof-way (ROW) (total of 97 acres). The monopole foundation holes generally extend to depths of
10-25 ft (3-7.6 m) with diameters of 2 ft (0.6 m). In extreme cases, the depth may extend as deep
as 60 ft (18.3 m).
As part of the permitting process for these projects, Oncor applies for a Certificate of
Convenience and Necessity (CCN) from the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC), as
required by Section 37.051 of the Texas Utilities Code (TUC). In granting the CCN, the PUC
routinely requests that Oncor comply with the requirements of the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)regarding the need for cultural resources investigations within the proposed project area
which generally consists of an intensive pedestrian survey of the ROW. ARC conducted an
archaeological survey for the proposed transmission line project on June 18-20, 2018. All work
was performed in accordance with the THC-approved Generic Research Design for
Archaeological Surveys of Oncor Electric Delivery Transmission Line Projects in Texas (PBS&J
2008). The generic research design stipulates the methods by which cultural resources within
proposed Oncor transmission line ROWs will be identified and assessed for National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) eligibility, and how site-specific
recommendations for additional archaeological research would be handled.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of
the THC (Council of Texas Archeologists 2018) and those found in the Oncor Generic Research
Design (PBS&J 2008). The following report presents a brief description of the natural setting of
the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and previous investigations
within the 97 acre project area. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in
the investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes
with recommendations followed by the references cited.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE LITTMAN-PHILLIPS ANDREWS TAP ROUTE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Andrews County is situated in the Shinnery sands and Arid Llano Estacado subregion of the
Southern High Plains ecoregion of Texas (Griffith et al. 2007). This region is the transition between
the wetter Llano Estacado to the northeast and the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas to the southwest.
The topography consists of slightly irregular plains and croplands. The Littman-Phillips Andrews
Tap route is located in the Shinnery sands subregion, which consists of sand hills and dunes with
flat sandy recharge areas (Griffith et al. 2007:22). Andrews County has a fairly xeric climate,
receiving between 13 and 18 inches of precipitation annually (Griffith et al. 2007:24). This
region is primarily used for ranching and as croplands with cotton and grain sorghum.
Additionally, oil and gas production occur throughout the region (Griffith et al. 2007:18).

Vegetation in the Southern High Plains includes a wide variety of tall grasses, shrubs, and trees
that are found primarily along drainages (Diamond et al. 1987:207). In the Shinnery sands
subregion, Havard (shin) oak brush, White Sand sagebrush, yucca, and prairie grasses are the
common plants recorded (Griffith et al. 2007:23). The region is also diverse in fauna despite the
chilling winter blizzards, the harsh summers, and low annual rainfall (Hofman 1989:13).
The western 0.4 km (0.3 mi) of the route lies in Holocene-aged sand deposits primarily
composed of windblown deposits, sand sheets, dunes, and dune ridges (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1976). The subsequent 5.9 km (3.7 mi) cross the Pliocene to Miocene age Ogallala
formation. The formation is made of layers of sand, silt, clay, gravel, and caliche. Local gravel
include pebbles and cobbles of quartz, quartzite, chert, and limestone. Within this formation, the
route crosses an unnamed intermittent stream. The remainder of the route, with the exception of
a small 0.5 km (0.3 mi) long segment of sand sheet deposits at the eastern end, is underlain by
early Pleistocene-aged Blackwater Draw Formation. This formation consists of sand, quartz, and
caliche nodules (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976).
Four soil associations are mapped in the project area and roughly align with the underlying
geology. The Holocene-aged sand deposits mapped on either end of the route are covered with
the Penwell-Jalmar association (nearly level to moderately sloping). This association has 10- to
30-cm-thick brown to reddish brown fine sand underlain by red fine sandy loam. The portion of
the route along the Ogallala formation is mapped as the Conger-Blakeney association (nearly
level). This association is characterized by 18-45 cm of brown to pale brown fine sandy loam
that is underlain by white caliche and cemented calcium carbonate. The Conger-Blakeney is
mapped on the western part of the route that is underlain by the Blackwater Draw formation but
is mapped with Faskin-Douro (nearly level), and Wickett-Triomas (nearly level) associations to
the east. The latter two associations have 6-41 cm of brown to reddish brown fine sand or sandy
loam atop reddish brown to red sandy clay loam (NRCS 2018).

CULTURAL HISTORY
The prehistory of the Southern Great Plains has received increased attention since Paleoindian
studies on the Plains began in the 1940s (Hays 1989; Johnson and Holliday 2004). The
chronological framework for human occupation in this region begins with the Paleoindian
(10,000-6000 BC) followed by the Archaic (6000 BC to 900 AD), the Late Prehistoric (AD 900
to 1400) and the Protohistoric (AD 1400 to 1540) periods then culminates with the Historic (AD
1540 to present) period.

Late Prehistoric
AD 900 to 1400
Archaic
6000 BC to AD 900
Paleoindian
10,000 BC to 6000 BC
Paleoindian Period
Though evidence for Paleoindian occupation is sparse in the southernmost extent of the Southern
Great Plains, the Paleoindian sites that are found in the region are some of the most significant
(Holliday 1997). Artifacts attributed to this period are distinctive Clovis and Folsom spear points
which were used by early inhabitants of this region (Hofman 1989:25). Occupation during this
period is characterized by migratory groups that hunted large and small game and foraged for
plant resources. Large game kill-sites and campsites have been recorded in the region. One of the
best-known Paleoindian sites reported in the Southern Great Plains is in nearby Midland County
to the southwest. The Midland Man was recorded at the Scharbauer site, which is located in the
southwestern corner of the county in a dune blowout along Monahans Draw (Wendorf et
al.1955). The partial human remains were determined at the time to be Late Pleistocene in age.
Six Clovis points have been reported from Andrews County and 28 from Gaines County to the
north (Bever and Meltzer 2007:67-68). Shifting Sands, a significant Folsom/Midland site, is
located in Winkler county while Winkler-1, a significant Midland site, is located in nearby Lea
County, New Mexico (Blaine et al. 2017; Rose 2011). Both of these sites held Paleoindian
artifacts in dune deposits.
Archaic Period
The Archaic is temporally subdivided into the Early, Middle and Late with distinctive projectile
points and knife types such as Calf Creek, Willis, and Ellis points and Clear Fork gouges used to
distinguish these periods (Hofman 1989:45). Along with the use of a wider variety of plants and
animals, artifact assemblages from this period reflect an increase in food processing behavior
such as plant grinding tools, roasting ovens, and rock-lined hearths (Hofman 1989:45).
Characteristics of Archaic groups include seasonal variation in subsistence activities and a
variety of site types. An increase in the variety of sites during this period is attributed to
population increases. Sites from this period consist of various forms of lithic artifacts including
dart points, and are primarily found near playas and along streams (Hughes 1989:20-21).

Late Prehistoric Period
During the Late Prehistoric, significant changes occurred in occupation patterns. Sedentary
villages were located along major streams. Artifact assemblages contain evidence of
technological changes such as the introduction of arrow points and ceramics (Hughes 1989:24).
The hunting of bison during this period significantly increased from the use of the animal in the
Archaic. Late Prehistoric campsites containing ceramics have been recorded at Monahans
Sandhills State Park (Barkes 1985).
Protohistoric Period
The Protohistoric period is the transition between the prehistoric and historic periods. Historic
Native American sites are extremely rare in the Southern High Plains (Johnson and Holliday
2004:293). The primary evidence of occupation is the occasional discovery of a glass trade bead,
metal arrowhead, or crevice burial at Native American sites (Skinner 2016:217).
Historic Period
Historic sites are highly varied within the Southern Great Plains and include forts, settlements,
homesteads, cemeteries, trading posts, dugouts, trash scatters, and caches. Though generally
sparse, evidence of Anglo-American occupation begins during the time of exploration and trade
(AD 1541 to 1820) and steadily increased until the Depression period (AD 1900 to 1940) (Hays
et al. 1989).
Andrews County was created from Bexar County in 1876, and after decades of boundary
changes, was made an official county in 1910 with the city of Andrews as the county seat
(Compton 2010). The first few decades of the 20th century showed marked population growth
and improved farmland within the county. The late 1920s and 1930s experienced a boom in oil
and gas production in the region and the number of oil fields in the county tripled in the 1950s.
Over the last 50 years, oil production has continued to increase while farming has fluctuated but
is generally on the decline.
Previous Investigations
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA), that included a search for properties
listed on the NRHP, shows that no recorded NRHP properties, historical markers, recorded
archaeological sites, previous archaeological surveys, state historic sites, or cemeteries are within
the Oncor Generic research design 1000 ft (305 m) buffer of the proposed route (TASA 2018).
Furthermore, no archaeological sites or SALs were recorded within this area.
Historic Map Review
In addition to a review of previous archaeological investigations, a historic map review was
conducted. SH176 is the only man-made feature mapped within the survey corridor on the 1936
Andrews County General Highway Map (GHM). By the time of the drafting of the 1955 GHM,
two windmills appear south of SH176 near the west end of the project area. However, on more

recent topographic maps, no structures are mapped. Historic aerial photographs were not
available and recent aerial photographs show that a significant portion of this area has been
disturbed and do not show the windmills or any structures within the project ROW.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The Oncor generic research design (PBS&J 2008) calls for the project area to be classified into
High Probability Areas (HPAs), Moderate Probability Areas (MPAs), and Low Probability Areas
(LPAs) on the basis of perceived likelihood for the occurrence of archaeological sites. For
prehistoric sites, this stratification is based on previously recorded site distributions, soils,
geomorphology, topography, prior disturbances, and distance from permanent and intermittent
water sources (i.e., creeks, rivers, and springs). These areas were identified prior to fieldwork.
For historic sites mapped locations of structures and distance to roads were the main factors.
In the Lower Plains, HPAs for prehistoric archaeological sites were defined as areas relatively
close (<500 m) to water sources, specifically on shoulder slopes, on alluvial and colluvial fans,
near upland edges adjacent to alluvial valleys, and near stream confluences. Holocene-age
alluvial terraces and floodplains were also classified as HPAs. Alluvial deposits offer the greatest
preservation potential for buried and stratified prehistoric sites. None of these types of settings
are within the current project area.
Prehistoric MPAs include areas that may contain archaeological remains, but their presence is
considered to be less likely due to greater distances to water or steeply sloped areas. These areas
include upland margins, Pleistocene terraces, and gently sloping hillsides and toe slopes more
than 500 m from streams.
LPAs are those areas in which prehistoric archaeological sites are unlikely to be present because
of steeply sloping topography, erosion, or modern development. Any prehistoric archaeological
sites in these settings would not likely retain integrity. There are no LPAs in the project area.
Following these guidelines, the Littman-Phillips Andrews route can be classified as having
moderate potential throughout. Though two windmills appear on historic maps, modern aerials
show these two locations as having severe disturbances. The portion of the intermittent drainage
that is crossed by and parallels the route is near the extreme upper end of the drainage and would
not have been a reliable water source.
No geoarchaeologically-sensitive areas were identified within the proposed ROW because the
deepest subsoil or bedrock is mapped as 46 cm below the surface, which is easily reached using a
shovel.
Methodology
Field personnel walked the proposed routes along two transects, each 16 ft (5 m) off the
proposed centerline and 16 ft (5 m) from the ROW edge, resulting in a 70-ft (21-m) survey
corridor. Shovel tests were excavated when ground visibility was below 30 percent and within
100 m of drainages regardless of ground visibility. Personnel made notes about the ground
exposure, soil types, drainages, and disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed. As outlined in
the Oncor Generic Research Design (PBS&J 2008), shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter and
were excavated in 10-cm (4-in) levels. Sandy soils were inspected visually and sifted through a

Â¼â wire mesh in order to determine if cultural materials were present. Soils were described on
the basis of color and texture, and the Munsell Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to identify the
specific soil colors in each test. Shovel tests were marked with a handheld GPS receiver.
Photographs were taken with a GPS-equipped, digital camera. If temporally significant artifacts
had been found on the surface or had any subsurface artifacts been recovered, they would have
been collected.
If archaeological sites had been identified, the site boundaries would have been delineated on the
basis of the surface distribution of artifacts and features and by shovel tests. A minimum of six
shovel tests would have been excavated in each site in orthogonal directions from features and/or
densest concentrations in order to determine extent and integrity of the sites. A sketch map for
each site would additionally be drawn in the field. Finally, a temporary field designation would
be assigned to each site and a TexSite form completed and submitted to TARL for assignment of
a permanent trinomial designation.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the project areaâs natural setting
along with results of the pedestrian survey. Conclusions derived from the survey close the
chapter. While shovel tests (STs) are described generally within the text, they are detailed at the
end of the results section in Table 2.
Survey Results
The Littman-Phillips Andrews Tap route was surveyed in its entirety along two transects placed
five m on either side of the proposed centerline (Figure 2 through Figure 7). Overall, the general
environment of the route was typical of the types of vegetation and lack of ground cover
expected in the Southern High Plains region (Figure 8). Vegetation included three- to four-ft-tall
mesquite and Havard shin oak along with buffalo grasses and the occasional yucca. Types of
succulents observed included cholla and button cactus but were infrequent. Ground visibility
generally ranged from 80 to 90 percent but was 20 to 40 percent near the drainage crossing.
Ground surface for most of the route is covered in caliche and pea- to melon-sized caliche
chunks. No chert or other material of knappable quality were observed.
The western end of the route connects to the Littman substation on the south side of SH176.
From here, the route parallels SH176 to the south for 4.2 km (2.6 mi). This portion of the route
has been significantly disturbed, likely as a result of ranching activities as well as road
construction. Push piles of modern trash, construction materials, and downed trees were
observed throughout this portion of the route (Figure 9). This portion of the route passed near
one of the mapped windmills. During survey, it was noted that this area is a slightly elevated
landform, however, with the exception of a modern stock tank, no historic or prehistoric cultural
resources were observed (Figure 10).
Approximately 4.2 km (2.6 mi) from the Littman substation, the line crosses SH176 and parallels
the north side of the road for approximately 8.6 km (5.3 mi). After crossing SH176, the route
continues east and crosses an intermittent drainage. The route crosses the drainage approximately
1.2 km (0.7 mi) east from where it crosses SH176. At the crossing and for several hundred
meters to either side, grasses become denser resulting in 20-40 percent ground visibility (Figure
11). Shovel tests were placed at the drainage crossing (STs 3-4) and in areas where ground
visibility dropped below 30 percent (STs 1-2, 5-7). Shovel tests revealed a shallow layer of loam
(less than 30 cm thick) underlain by degrading limestone bedrock. No terraces were noted where
the survey corridor crosses the drainage. The banks of the drainage were less than 50 cm high
and gently sloped (Figure 12). No artifacts or features were identified during survey of this
segment or in the STs.
Beginning approximately one km east of the drainage crossing until the eastern kilometer of the
route, the route and ROW corridor has been mowed (Figure 13). This resulted in 100 percent
ground visibility. Approximately 1.1 km (0.7 mi) prior to where the route turns northeast away
from SH176, was where the other windmill was mapped. However, no cultural resources were
observed. The route turns northeast, away from SH176, for 4.9 km (3.3 mi). The route then

connecting to the Phillips Andrews Tap.

Conclusions
No cultural resources were located during survey of the proposed Littman-Phillips Andrews Tap
138-kV transmission line route. Regarding historic resources, these results were expected, since
the only mapped features were in areas that appeared as disturbed on recent aerial photographs.
A large portion of the proposed transmission line route parallels SH176, a historic road that is
visible on the 1936 Andrews County General Highway Map (GHM). It was expected that
structures and features associated with the various ranching and oil activities would appear in
close proximity to this main road for accessibility purposes. This is the case for the overall
region where several structures, windmills, oil fields, pump stations, wells, and gravel pits are
observed on both historic maps and recent aerials. However, due to the intensive disturbance
observed along the route from previous construction and ranching activities it is possible that any
historic structures or features present have been destroyed.
With respect to prehistoric cultural resources , these findings were expected due to the lower
potential settings including uplands and long distances from major drainages. While the route
does cross an unnamed intermittent drainage, the location of this crossing is high in the
watershed, close to the headwaters and likely would not have served as an ideal water resource.
Similarly, while a portion of the route is underlain by the Ogallala formation, no chert or other
knappable material was encountered. Despite the presence of prehistoric sites recorded within
the region, these sites were encountered in different settings than what was observed within the
route. on top of dunes and in close proximity to water resources (TASA 2018).

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present
within the proposed Littman-Phillips Andrews Tap 138-kV transmission line route in Andrews
County, Texas. No cultural resources were encountered during this survey. As such, AR
Consultants, Inc. recommends that construction of the proposed transmission line project be
allowed to proceed and that no additional archaeological investigations are necessary. However,
should the proposed ROW alignment change, additional archaeological survey may be
necessary. Also, if previously unidentified archaeological artifacts, features, or deposits are
encountered during construction, it is recommended that the discovery be evaluated by a
professional archaeologist in consultation with the THC.
