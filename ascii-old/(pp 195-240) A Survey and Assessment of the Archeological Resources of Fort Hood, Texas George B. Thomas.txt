A Survey and Assessment of the Archeologlcal
Resources of Fort Hood, Texas
GEORGE B. THOMAS

ABSTRACT
The results of six years of amateur archeological survey on the
Fort Hood military reservation are discussed in detail. Acting under
an archeological survey permit authorized by the Department of the
Interior for two of those six years, the Fort Hood Archeological
Society successfully surveyed portions of the 217,000 acres (339
square miles) of the installation. While survey method -- or lack of
method -- and collection practices certainly biased the sample, it
was felt that tentative settlement patterns could be determined by
correlating chronologically diagnostic artifacts with topographic
variables. Discernible patterns appear similar to those elsewhere in
central Texas. We await future work, using adequate sampling techniques, to test the results and tentative conclusions of this able
amateur survey.

INTRODUCTION
The Fort Hood Archeological Society (FHAS) conducted a site
distribution survey on the Fort Hood Military Reservation (Fig. 1,a)
from December, 1971 until the late months of 1977. For two years
of that period, August 27, 1974 to August 26, 1976, the FHAS
operated under Department of the Interior Survey Permit No. 74TX-053. Fort Hood land is subject to numerous U. S. Army regulations governing the treatment and preservation of "archeological
resources," (PL #209, June 8, 1906; PL #93-291, May 24, 1974; AR
200-1; AR 405-80), as well as to Executive Order (EO) 11593 -Federal legislation requiring the survey and assessment of archeological and historic resources on Federal lands by July 1, 1973. In
spite of the evident impracticability of the Executive Order, prevailing legal opinion seems to indicate that it is still in effect, and

that EO 11593 forms part of the basis for the Post Archeologist
position, currently under the Master Planning Department of the
Fort Hood Directorate of Facilities Engineering.
This report will concentrate upon the results of the FHAS
survey until shortly after the termination of Permit No. 74-TX-053.
It will also consider the results of a tentative settlement pattern
study on the basis of surface evidence and projectile point chronologies, to be compared with regional syntheses published by others
(Shafer 1971; and Weir 1976). Finally, we will discuss special problems inherent in archeology on military land.
Of the approximately 217,000 acres (339 square miles) of Fort
Hood land, investigators from 1971 to 1973 limited themselves
mostly to the easily accessible North Nolan Creek and Owl Creek
drainages. Later investigators extended the survey, most notably
to the Cowhouse Creek drainage, as Society members decided to
broaden the scope of areas and ecozones considered.
Further limitations to the survey were imposed by the Impact
Area, an area of approximately 56,000 acres (87 square miles),
which is usually inaccessible for reasons which are selfexplanatory. The remaining 160,000 acres (approximately 250
square miles) are open post area during most of the year. Antiquities preservation is the subject of little to no enforcement on
post, having proven "impossible" in the absence of survey.
In spite of these problems, survey has been scheduled
judiciously by non-professionals, working when military occupations permit, and motivated by professional goals. Fort Hood Archeological Society members, who at one time had four individuals
among them with academic backgrounds in archeology, managed
to gain sponsorship of the Recreation Services Library as a Private
Organization. By late 1977, the FHAS still existed on paper, and
the newly-hired post archeologist was hopeful of rejuvenating the
organization.

ENVIRONMENT
Geology
Fort Hood is located in portions of Bell and Coryell Counties,
central Texas, in a region traversed by the Balcones Escarpment
and Balcones Fault. The fault zone is part of a major geologic
feature extending from the Red River valley, through Dallas,
Waco, Austin, San Antonio, and curving westward across the

Rio Grande into Coahuila. In the Fort Hood region, the Balcones
Fault System is indistinct, having been described as a 7-mile
wide graben zone passing through the town of Belton, the Bell
County seat. Small, discontinuous faults in this zone line up "en
echelon" (Adkins and Arick 1930: 74), just below the Edwards
Plateau, the southernmost region of the southern Plains.
Throughout the fault region is the Balcones tableland, or
Lampasas Cut Plain, a dissected plain from which rise fossiliferous limestone hills. These limestone caprock hills are flattopped remnants of the Edwards formation of the Cretaceous
Fredericksburg group (Sellards, Adkins and Plummet 1958: 332340; and ]elks 1962: 1). Resistant Fredericksburg limestone is
underlain by softer Comanche Peak limestone, causing undermining, steep slopes, and rockshelters. Predominant geological composition of the eroded terraces and floodplains is Walnut clay
(Adkins and Arick 1930: 29). The tableland yields farther southeast to the Blackland Prairie, a region of dark, fertile soil, rolling
southeastward to the Gulf coastal plain.
While Fort Hood land lies entirely within the Cut Plain
region, the southern portion of the post is more extensively
eroded, with fewer flat-topped hills (Edwards outliers) (Adkins
and Arick 1930: 29), and with rounded, rolling, broad alluvial
land among them, resembling prairie. This relatively flat terrain
is of generally higher elevation than the valleys of the dissected
hilly region to the north, and the occasional flat-topped hills to
the south are correspondingly higher than the limestone plateaus
to the north.
Fort Hood is situated within the Brazos River drainage between the Leon and Lampasas Rivers. Drainage in both regions
is dendritic, tending to be more angular in the north than in the
south. The urbanized, main "cafltonment area" of Fort Hood is
located in the southern region, immediately south of the southernmost Cretaceous hills. Creeks and rivers trend from westnorthwest to east-southeast. Major drainages of the dissected
hill and plateau region are the Leon River, forming a portion of
the north boundary of Fort Hood; Owl Creek, which was the
location of most FHAS survey before 1974; and Cowhouse Creek,
the large, central drainage, having steep sides and wide floodplains. Stampede Creek flows southward into Cowhouse Creek
through a broad, rolling valley.
In the southern portion of Fort Hood, Clear Creek flows

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

199

northward as part of the Table Rock Creek/House Creek/Cottonwood Creek drainage pattern flowing northward into Cowhouse
Creek. Other streams in the southern region include North Nolan
Creek, again flowing west-northwest to east-southeast; and Reese
Creek, which flows southward toward the Lampasas River.
Other major tributaries of Cowhouse and Owl Creeks, and of the
Leon River, are located in the Impact Area.
Climate
Fort Hood receives an annual rainfall of 33.4 inches, with
most of it concentrated during the months of September and
May. July is the month with least rainfall. The area is near the
boundary of two climatic zones: the semi-arid steppe climate to
the west, and the warm, temperate, rainy climate with hot
summers to the east. The average temperature is 68.1Â°F, with a
range of 94Â°F to 38Â°F as the mean summer-winter temperatures.
The frequency of frontal conditions means that abrupt changes
in weather conditions are frequent (U. S. Army 1971).
Fauna
White tail deer, bison, mountain lion, bobcat, wolf, coyote,
cottontail and jackrabbits, skunk, opossum, raccoon, fox,
rodents, turkey, dove, owl, hawk, fish, mollusks, snails, and
various species of snake, turtle, and lizard were among the
animal resources available to prehistoric inhabitants of the Fort
Hood region. Armadillo and ringtail cat are recent faunal additions derived from Mexico. All of these except bison are
present in modern times.
Flora

Vegetation on Fort Hood consists of the familiar combination
of central Texas grassland, shrubs, and trees. Upland trees
include live oak, Spanish oak, post oak, and juniper ("cedar"),
while pecan, willow, sycamore, bur oak, and cottonwood trees
occur in the lowlands. The growth of juniper Ouniperus
mexicana) has increased since early historic times. Rounding out
the flora are grasses and various plant species associated with
grassland, dense stands of brush, and vines. Trees tend to
cluster densely along the stream beds and on steep bluff slopes
of the limestone hills. Trees also cluster in linear patterns following historic fence lines (which appear prominently on orthopicto

maps and aerial photographs). "Roots, pecans, walnuts, acorns,
mesquite beans, plums, prickly pear fruit [Opuntia engeimannii],
mulberries, grapes, and other edible vegetal foods are found in
abundance in central Texas, and it is likely that many of them
were eaten" (Jelks 1962: 93).

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF FORT HOOD
AND VICINITY
Archeological surveys in the region have included the
studies at Belton (Miller and Jelks 1952; and Shafer, Suhm and
Scurlock 1964) and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoirs (Sorrow, Shafer
and Ross 1967). Among other regional archeological work, notable publications have concerned the Youngsport Site on the
Lampasas River, Bell County (Shafer 1963); the Finis Frost Site,
on Richland Springs Creek, San Saba County (Green and Hester
1973); the Kyle Site, Hill County (Jelks 1962); the Loeve-Fox site,
Williamson County (Prewitt 1974); and a survey of the Leon River
(Shafer 1971; Watt 1936: 5-27).
Most Fort Hood sites are typical of the Central Texas Archaic; rock and sh~l middens are numerous, with large limestone-derived sedimentary flint (chert) sources utilized extensively. Scrapers (if we can accept this functionally descriptive
label) are apparently most numerous on the surface of most
sites, with flake knives, choppers, engraving tools and burins,
drills, and an occasional gouge also occurring. Cores, some of
them quite large, can sometimes include biface chopper-like
implements. Bifaces are abundant at some sites, they range from
blanks or preforms, through finely-shaped knives or scrapers, to
projectile points. As the projectile point illustrations indicate
(Figs. 2-12), the surface-collected specimens are usually in a
fragmentary state.
Equally prominent in the Central Texas Archaic sites of Fort
Hood are implements probably related to plant food collecting
and processing. Milling stones, whole and fragmentary, have
been located in all microenvironmental or terrain contexts.
The sites themselves range from small-area surface scatters
or burned rock middens, to large flake and biface scatters
covering one, two, or more square kilometers. Some large site
complexes extend for as many as three or four km2 on or near
the flat limestone hilltops, and may be associated with flint
sources.

METHODOLOGY OF SURVEY
The informal nature of Fort Hood Archeological Society
membership meant that survey and laboratory analysis did not
take place regularly, or follow a consistent research design.
Usually working on weekends, field crews drove to one or more
selected areas, where they engaged in walking, non-random site
location survey. It could be said that a "drainage corridor" technique was used. From one to approximately 10 individuals
participated. U.S. Department of Defense maps were plentiful,
including maps discarded by various military units to which
Society members belonged, and others that were provided by the
post engineers. These military maps were of excellent quality,
and were available in 1:25,000; 1:50,000; 1:75,000; and smaler
scales. Orthopicto maps, which combine an aerial photographic
mosaic background with standard mapping symbols, were available at 1:25,000. These maps enabled extremely accurate
plotting of site locations.
Artifact, shell, bone, and burned rock samples were
collected from virtually all Fort Hood sites. Most of these were
uncontrolled "grab" samples, and were justified on two grounds:
(1} Time limited FHAS members to rapid site location activities,
while members felt the need to famliarize themselves with the
nature of artifacts, their sorting, cataloguing, and storage; (2)
extensive looting on the post convinced members that collections,
if only partially controlled, kept some of the artifact inventory
away from those of less than professional bent. Controlled
collection would have been possible under current conditions of
full-time, professional supervision. Under the conditions imposed
on Society members in previous years, however, a "nocollection" policy might have been more desirable and, in spite
of the looting, such policy would have enabled more accuracy in
future controlled sampling.
With no coherent teaching organization, no accreditation,
and no obvious avenue for FHAS members to add to their own
credentials, later, more scientific phases of the survey project
left many individuals lost and disinterested. A "90% labwork/lO% fieldwork" policy served to make the lab a quiet and
peaceful place to work, but there was little assistance. Fieldwork also took its toll on membership, as we left the idle streams
of the drainage corridors, plunged into the thick underbrush, and

202

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

climbed to the bluff-tops and plateaus in 110Â°F weather.
To facilitate site differentiation, and to create a problem
formulation and hypothesis testing framework, we divided Fort
Hood land into seven terrain zones (Fig. l,b). These appear to
correspond with "microenvironments" or biological ecozones:
Narrow Terrace
Bluff-Top
Floodplain
Bluff-Slope and Draw
Prairie
Rockshelter
Broad Terrace
We also divided Fort Hood into drainage zones, taking into
account creek size in order to include smaller creeks within larger
watersheds or creek systems. Thus Bull Run Creek, Stampede
Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Two Year Old Creek are part of the
Cowhouse Creek system, Preacherâs Creek is part of the Owl Creek
system, and Henson Creek and Shoal Creek are part of the Leon
River system. Some of these smaller drainages are treated separately, however, for finer differentiation.
Earlier surveyors, relying solely upon the drainage zones technique, limited the survey to corridors which followed creek valleys
and immediately adjacent bluffs. Later survey results have come
from semi-systematic, problem-oriented efforts, while most recent
survey has begun to extend to all terrain contexts. Standard
sampling techniques may show site distribution concentrated in or
near the valley areas, where ecozonal boundaries, flint sources,
creeks and springs could be exploited. No systematic study has
confirmed this. A more comprehensive, full-time survey project is
needed, perhaps beginning with the hypothetical assumption that
no sites have been located. Fortunately, the recently-hired post
archeologist has also proposed this strategy (Briuer 1977: personal
communication). This strategy should provide the most reliable test
of the results presented here.
For present purposes, we can assume that the Fort Hood
Archeological Survey site distribution results are reasonably
accurate, given the personnel and part-time conditions under
which the survey was made. The following terrain summaries are
presented as an overview of the archeological setting as conceived
at present.

Bluff-Top: These sites line the bluff-tops of the Cretaceous hills, sometimes
extending in massive, multi-occupational surface scatters from the bluff edges to the

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

2O3

opposite side of a plateau. Bluff-top sites may have been seasonal occupation sites,
hunting camps, stone chipping stations (or combinations of these} and are characterized by light to dense surface scatters, very likely without notable depth. Usually
eroding from highly deflated soil cover, burned rock middens may be numerous
here. Vegetation cover can be grasses, with vegetation usually associated with grassland; along with upland trees. Inhabitants of bluff-top sites may have utilized bluff
slopes and rockshelters extensively.

Bluff Slope and Draw: These sites are often closely associated with bluff-top
sites and rockshelters. As the terrain type suggests, there may be much erosional
wash here, with many artifacts secondarily deposited from rockshelters or from
on top of the escarpment. However, the frequent incidence of burned rock middens eroding from bluff slopes, and washing down steep draws, lends substance
to this terrain type as a primary site location. Artifacts may be concentrated in
light to dense scatters. Test excavations in 1972 at 41 BL 138, the observation of
fresh pot-holes dug by collectors on Fort Hood, and WPA work reported by Collins
(1972} at the Devilâs Hollow Site, all took place in bluff slope areas. Vegetation is
these zones is likely to consist of heavy tree cover, with upland varieties predominating.

Rockshelter: These sites, as noted above, will be closely associated with blufftop, and bluff slope and draw sites in many cases. Many Leon River rockshelters
contained post-Archaic burials (Shafer 1971: 3}; however these had almost all
been vandalized at the time of the survey. Whether Fort Hood rockshelters
contain burials of the Austin and Toyah Foci remains to be seen. Rockshelters
may have provided shelter, as indicated by minor midden activity observable in
front of some. Often springs are conveniently located. Because rockshelters are
geologically associated with bluff-top edges and bluff-slopes, vegetation will be of
the same configuration as in bluff-slope areas without rockshelters.

Broad Terrace: These sites are on wide, rolling terraces, situated above floodplains. They contain moderate to dense lithic surface scatters, and are usually
sites of intensive or extensive occupation. Most of these sites have been plowed,
and are old agricultural fields with historic fence lines marked by straight lines of
trees. One natural profile cut into a terrace site indicates shallow cultural deposition. The great extent of horizontal distribution at such sites, however, suggests
the possibility of controlled surface studies of intra-site activity variability. A grid
system was established at 41 CV 73 with this in mind; but few controlled sampling
collections were attempted. Burned rock middens can be discerned on broad
terraces, scattered by plowing. Vegetation here is usually grassland, with lowland
trees growing in clumps, or along historic fence lines.
Narrow Terrace: These sites are geologically similar to broad terrace sites;
however, they occur in restricted areas between bluffs and floodplains. Usually
there is little or no evidenc.e of historic plowing, and burned rock midden activity
here can be undisturbed. Narrow terraces may or may not be culturally distinct
from broad terraces, but the arbitrary distinction may be useful. Burned rock

204

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

middens may be most dense here, under alluvial overburden from the nearby
slopes. These areas are also most susceptible to looting, probably because of the
proximity of bluff slope trees, dirt roads, and the furtive nature of looting activities. Concealment and evasion opportunities are close-by.
Floodplain: These sites may also be washouts from bluff slopes; however,
there are indisputable sites in this terrain type. Floodplain sites may be characterized by burned rock middens, sometimes disturbed by historic plowing. Artifacts
often indicate occupational activity. Vegetation on the floodplains is usually grassland, with clumps of lowland trees. Dense stands of lowland trees often line the
stream banks.
Prairie: These sites are located in the Edwards Outlier areas, south and
southeast of the main land area of Fort Hood. The rolling to flat terrain suggests
transition to the Blackland Prairie farther to the southeast. Archeological sites
here are often near stream confluences. Prairie sites may utilize relatively high
ground, and may be similar to terrace sites except for their smaller size, and the
absence of plowing in rocky, marly soil. While most of the old Edwards formation
has eroded away here, the soil is extremely rocky, with many Cretaceous fossils
among the breccia. Sites in the prairie region may also cluster on or near the
slopes of the isolated Cretaceous hills, especially if streams are conveniently
located. Although little survey has taken place in this southern portion of Fort
Hood, we may conjecture that site distribution and settlement pattern may be
affected by the different arrangement and fewer varieties of biotic zones for subsistence exploitation by hunting-collecting societies.

As of early 1977, 81 prehistoric sites on Fort Hood were
registered with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
Austin. Five additional registration numbers, not included here,
represent four historic sites and one off-post site (41 CV 51)
improperly investigated in 1973, on the private land of one FHAS
member. Site 41 BL 155 and 156 are considered together, having
been found upon later survey to be one massive surface scatter,
as described earlier in our section on bluff-top sites. To these 87
sites we may add 18 additional sites not yet registered. Nine of
these were located as a result of the joint survey efforts of the
North Texas State University crew, and individuals from the
FHAS. The North Texas State University Institute of Applied
Sciences was contracted by the City of Copperas Cove to assess
the archeological resources along the proposed route of a wastewater pipeline (McCormick and Filson 1976). As of early 1977 a
total of 105 archeological and historic sites was on record at the
Fort Hood Archeological Society.
Notable sites include 41 BL 146, 41 BL 154/160 and 41 CV
73. BL 146 is a petroglyph locus on the northern edge of a low

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

205

bluff, at the head of a draw. A flowing spring rises at the draw
head, just below the petroglyph outcrop. The site is surrounded
by a massive scatter of burned-rock middens and lithics, ineluding an unusually ample representation of projectile points.
Investigators have been unable to discern limits, other than
natural ones, to the site, which extends southward to the opposite edge of the plateau, and northward across the floodplain
to the creek. The petroglyphs include intriguing figures of historical, post-European-contact origin, including the letters "AD."
Others are of uncertain significance.
BL 154/160 is a complex of middens and lithic scatters occupying a relatively limited area, yet occupying four of the possible six terrain types or ecozones. A burned rock midden is surrounded by lithic scatter on the bluff-top; two rockshelters are
just under the escarpment, with lithic and shell midden material
eroding down the slope and the associated draw. A spring at the
base of the slope is in close proximity to burned rock middens
and lithic scatter on the floodplain.
CV 73 is a broad terrace site located on both sides of an
Owl Creek tributary stream which cuts deeply into the terrace.
The surface has been extensively plowed and deflated, and currently carries a heavy load of off-road military traffic. The distinctive features of this site are its broad expanse and dense
lithic deposition, inviting easy gridding and on-site control.
Gridding and controlled collection were attempted here in 1975
and 1976, until extensive military traffic obliterated artillery
firing point #131, which we were using for a bench-mark-like
reference point. (FP 131 was replaced by late 1977, apparently
at the same spot, although we have not been able to check it for
accuracy). The north base line, extending 250m. from FP 131,
was laid out in a 338Â° 30â direction, ending at a deep natural
soil profile cut by the tributary. Observation of these profiles
show the site to have shallow cultural depth at these locations;
however, testing could determine areas of little or no plowing,
and if significant stratigraphy is present.
TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT PATTERN ANALYSIS
Of the 81 sites included in this analysis, 41 produced
chronologically diagnostic artifacts (projectile points), and are
included in the following settlement pattern analysis. Nineteen of

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

206

the 31 Bell County sites are included; with 22 of the 50 Coryell
County sites. It remains to be seen whether the remaining 40
non-diagnostic sites can be tested to discern chronological patterning by tool type frequencies and lithic manufacture
variability in the collected samples. Chronology is not the only
interest. Predominant flake size, lithic material, the presence
and frequency of utilized and debitage flakes, cores, blanks, and
bifacial tools should indicate industrial activity patterning in
Archaic society. It is doubtful that either of these can be discerned from the FHAS collections. 41 CV 73 is the only site at
which controlled surface sampling has been attempted, and we
were unable to complete it.
What could be tested were the hypotheses generated about
chronological settlement changes, using the projectile pointproducing sites only. With such a small sample, and relying on
surface data for the most part (data from 41 BL 138 must be
considered uncontrolled excavational), one must keep in mind
the tentative nature of the settlement pattern study.

The sherd was excavated from the bluff-slope approximately 2 km NW of the
known extent of 41 CV 92, near the south bank of the Leon River. A second sherd,
located in November, 1977, was from the rockshelter site 41 BL 181. While it
would be productive to include ceramics in any future analysis, none have been
included here.

Chronological Considerations
Of the various chronological schemes applicable to central
Texas, and presented in Fig. 18 (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Shafer
1963; Willey 1966; 329-337, Sorrow, Sharer and Ross 1967;
Johnson 1967; 23-24; and Weir 1976), Weirâs five-phase system
for the Archaic lends itself most readily to projectile point
chronological analysis. Morphological distinctions can be
discerned: stemmed (Clear Fork); basal notching (Round Rock};
broad points with corner notching {San Marcos}; and side
notched (Twin Sisters). Weirâs early phase (San Geronimo) is
tentatively represented by one Gower point from uncontrolled excavational context (Fig. 6,f}; while one possible "Early Barbed"
stem base (Fig. 7,k) was not included in the San Geronimo phase
for the settlement pattern study. Two additional Gower variants
are worthy of mention (Fig. l l,g,h); although they are from an
off-post site, and were not included in the analysis.
Weirâs sytem was constructed with the assumption that
phases overlap. This is likely to be an accurate reflectin of
stylistic and typological change in cultural processes. All
cultures arrive at stylistic modes, but are never static: rather
they are in a state of continual transition. Perhaps significantly,
Weir {1976 makes no mention of the Transitional Archaic (ca.
500 B.C.-ca. A.D. 1800). The use of the term "transitional" implies that transition is something new and unusual, rather than

the normal situation. Other researchers have found no evidence
of overlap (Prewitt 1974; and personal communication 1977).
Be that as it may, the Fort Hood data grouped easily into
artificially-conceived "components," each of which clustered
into what might be called "chronological modes," for the sake of
tentative analysis. Site distribution maps (on file, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Austin) indicate the probable settlement pattern changes through time; while in Figs. 19 and 20,
projectile point-producing sites are represented by schematic
battleship curves. Both Bell and Coryell County sites are
arranged chronologically by mean site date, weighted according
to the number of chronological indicators (points) in each chronological mode component. Longer battleship curves indicate more
chronological mode components -- hence, according to surface
evidence, longer site use. A glance at the battleship curve for
site 41 BL 138 may indicate the effects of excavational data
upon a surface sample from numerous sites. The overall impression from these initial charts, however, indicates the possibility
of nonrandom changes in settlement patterning through time.
Terrain types, as represented in Fig. 1,b, add another
dimension to the analysis. The question was, how much of this
nonrandom settlement patterning change was according to
terrain, and how could this be correlated with other central
Texas archeological data and conclusions in the form of functional hypotheses? When terrain type and chronology were
correlated, we could produce settlement frequency graphs (Figs.
21, 22).
To arrive at the interpretations in Fig. 21, the mean date
was determined for each site as in Fig. 19 and 20. Chronological
mode components with more projectile points represented, were
weighted more than those with fewer points, thus giving us mean
site dates which may be more accurate. Sites were then segregated according to primary terrain type or microenvironment,
and the percentages of dated sites at each terrain type determined. These results were more striking than those represented
in Fig. 22.
To arrive at the interpretations in Fig. 22, sites were
ignored, and all projectile points totalled in each artificiallydetermined chronological mode component. These totals were
then segregated as in Fig. 21, according to terrain type. The
advantage of this second procedure was in its representation of

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

227

the separate chronological mode components, and the multiple
terrain types represented at many of the larger sites. Results,
while not as striking, may have been more specifically accurate.
The advantage of the first procedure (Fig. 21} may be in its
reflection of possible general tendencies in settlement patterning. As we can see from the graphs, and for the figures
presented in Fig. 23, Neo-American (post-Archaic) manifestations
are not well-represented from Fort Hood surface data. Two
Scallorn points (Austin Phase] and two Perdiz points (Toyah
Phase], from three separate sites, round out the diagnostic lithic
inventory; while the few known ceramics (one represented in Fig.
17) complete the total Neo-American sample. While most of these
data were being processed, there was no choice but to concentrate upon the Archaic.
Hypotheses
Because of the preliminary nature of any survey, hypotheses
must derive from preliminary observations and from the local
archeological literature. Thus we might state two hypotheses. (1}
Rockshelters came into use starting in the late Archaic (Shafer
1971: 2}; and (2) bison hunting increased during the same period
(Weir 1976). A third hypothesis, which we shall discuss first,
derives from preliminary observation, supported by implications
in Bryant (1969) that the water-table was higher, and the central
Texas climate was wetter before the late Middle Archaic {Weirâs
San Marcos Phase] ca. 1,000 B.C. (Shafer 1971: 2). During the
earlier phases, then, rockshelters would be too wet for habitation, and floodplain areas would be swampland. This would
channel habitation to the bluff-tops, terraces, and prairie highlands. Preliminary observations of a portion of the broad Cowhouse Creek floodplain showed the area to lack sites, while sites
(41 CV 57, 79, 80, 81 82, 83, 95, 96, and 97) line the bluff-tops in
the immediate vicinity.
Later observations of the same floodplain at a stream confluence ca. 3 km to the northwest, cast the first doubts upon the
"absence from floodplains" hypothesis (41 CV 88 and 89). Finally
we can see from both Figures 21 and 22, that there was never
any such absence. The general trend was no significant change
in percentage of floodplain habitation from early Middle Archaic
(Clear Fork Phase] times to the end of the Archaic.

228

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Checking the first two hypotheses against the data, we find
that they can be tentatively confirmed. Both interpretations show
rockshelter occupation to be either central or late in the Archaic
sequence. Fig. 22, based upon individual chronological modes,
places rockshelter occupation in Weirâs San Marcos and Twin
Sisters Phases, clearly supporting Hypothesis 1. Bluff-top occupation appears to have undergone significant changes according to both Figs. 21 and 22. In both graphs rockshelter occupation is represented as coinciding with the later of the two
upsurges of bluff-top occupation; with bluff-slope and draw occupation showing the most significant increase in Fig. 21, during
the Twin Sisters Phase, Late Archaic. Correspondingly, broad
terrace occupation shows a brief burst in the Round Rock Phase,
Middle Archaic, during one of the lulls in bluff-top occupation. It
would seem also that there was positive population movement
toward the bluff-tops, rather than movement away from lowland
swamps. Superimposing a proposed schedule of bison absence
from the southern Plains upon Figs. 21 and 22 (Dillehay 1974),
we are able to further correlate Fort Hood data with that from
elsewhere in central Texas. If we may connect bluff-top, rockshelter, and bluff-slope occupation with bison hunting, we may
confirm Hypothesis 2: tentative Fort Hood evidence would
support conclusions that bison hunting increased during the Late
Archaic, until the bison population declined.
While this correlation may be tenuous, it enables us to
define further problems: will excavation or more systematic site
sampling confirm or deny a correlation between population use
of the high ground and bison hunting on Fort Hood? The
presence of high-ground flint sources does not account for
population flunctuation.

FUTURE PROBLEMS
As archeological investigations continue on Fort Hood, we
might expect further progression away from the original "babesin-the-woods," favorite spot techniques of the early FHAS.
Before the much-delayed institution of an archeologistâs position
at Fort Hood, I was formulating program stages characterized by
increased problem orientation, and culminating in selected excavation only in the later stages. Post archeologist F.L. Briuer has
commenced upon a uniquely flexible program, in which inter-

disciplinary archeology and salvage "mitigation" are wellbalanced. Briuerâs interest in botanical and zoological aspects of
human behavior, along with an eagerness to try innovative
sampling techniques, should be a major contribution toward
solving basic problems of regional archeology.
The prevailing practice in earlier years of collecting large,
uncontrolled samples, has caused minor disruption of artifact
patterning on the surface at a time when controlled surface
sampling methods are coming more and more into style (Davis
1975: 39-53; and Dancey 1976). This in addition to the extensive
vandalism in the more accessible areas of Fort Hood, may
present obstacles to both surface and sub-surface sampling.
Chronological data could become more completely representative following stratigraphic testing. Excavation projects
might assist in refinement of local Archaic chronologies. At Evoe
Terrace (41 BL 104), two Angostura points are evidence of
terminal Paleo-Indian occupation in the local vicinity (ca. 6,0007,000 B.C.); while 17 Perdiz, 7 Cliffton, and 10 Sca!lorn points are
evidence that Neo-American components (A.D. 500-1500) are
present (Sorrow, Shafer and Ross 1967: 123-135, and 142).
Other efforts might be directed toward an assessment of the
Fort Hood lands for archeological burial populations. Watt
(1936: 5-27) and Shafer (1971: 3) cite rockshelters in the bluffs
along the Leon River as late prehistoric burial grounds. This
pattern continuesâ along the Leon and other sub-drainages, to the
Brazos River bluffs. Open burial sites on the terraces and floodplains are generally placed in the late periods of incipient village
agriculture, with the westward spread of marginal Caddoan
influences (Shafer 1971: 3). Little evidence is available on burial
populations from Archaic or earlier stages in the Fort Hood
region. Comprehensive inventories of skeletal remains in central
Texas are presented by Prewitt (1974: 51-67).
Definitive studies oLburial populations are well-represented
in the literature, notably from the North American Southwest
(Longacre 1975: 71-74). Here again, however, extensive looting in
the Fort Hood area prevented extensive studies of rockshelter
burial populations (Shafer 1971: 3). It is reasonable to expect,
however, that most open-site burials -- if any -- on Fort Hood
would be intact, and available for sampling, such as at the
Frisch Auf! site (41 FY 42) (Hester and Collins 1969).

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

235

Dwelling, or discrete occupational/activity areas, might
become evident by means of controlled surface sampling, but is
more likely to appear through excavation. Shafer (1971: 3) notes
evidence of wattle and daub structural material in association
with round ceramic, shell and bone concentrations at a site on a
narrow terrace of Elm Creek near Troy. These hint of late
prehistoric (Caddoan-like) dwellings; however no evidence of
thatching or other roof structure has been located. Archaic
dwellings pose a problem. In the absence of evidence, one may
resort to shaky ethnographic analogy to assist with hypothesisformulation, even though ethnographic connection between the
Archaic and the Neo-American is unknown. Newcomb (1961:
140} offers "the bisonhide tepee" of the Tonkawas, "small,
squat, and crude, never the tall, imposing, and beautiful lodges
typical of northern Plains tribes." Coahuiltecans placed "reed
mats and hides over bent saplings to form low, circular huts"
(Newcomb 1961: 43). Ethnographic descriptions from little or no
data leave us primarily with conjecture, and with the knowledge
that "more work needs to be done."

ARCHEOLOGY ON MILITARY LANDS
Attempts are becoming more frequent to do archeological
research on military lands. Field school and club-like activities,
some of them attaining professional or near-professional standards, are known from West Point, New York; and Fort Belvoir,
Virginia. Other posts, like Fort Sill, Oklahoma, have extensive
archeological and historical programs and museum systems.
Army and Air Force personnel on their way to Fort Irwin, California for a field exercise in 1976, were briefed on preservation
of archeological fragile patterning in the Mojave Desert. There is
an Army publication detailing some of the procedures for archeological and historical preservation programs on military
lands (U.S. Army 1975}. Finally, both Fort Bliss and Fort Hood
hired archeologists in 1977.
What should be most notable to those interested in research
potentials on military lands is the restricted or semi-restricted
nature of most such areas. Fort Hood itself is officially regarded
as "unrestricted," except in the impact area, where danger to
life and limb should be obvious; and except in certain restricted
security areas. During some military maneuvers, selected areas

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

236

of Fort Hood are off-limits to "non-combatant" individuals. Areas
of post usually open to the general public are closed to all nonhunters on holidays and weekends, during a short winter hunting
season, except between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Security and impact areas may thus be the only areas
relatively untouched by looters and vandals: the 57,000 acres (87
square miles) of Fort Hoodâs impact area have remained almost
untouched by the present survey. If this area has remained free
of vandalism as well, it could provide the opportunity for conventional or innovative controlled sampling, and perhaps modified
versions of what Davis (1975) calls "exposed archaeology,"
coordinating with Fort Hood Range Control to undertake survey
in areas which are periodically cleared and made safe for entry.
Davis, working in the Mojave Desert, California, has taken
advantage of a segment of the China Lake Naval Gunnery Range,
no longer in use, and thus an area which long remained practically inaccessible. This area provides relatively undisturbed
archeological surface patterns for Davisâ project. Decades of
Naval bombardment of selected target areas has produced
negligible damage when compared with damage by collectors.
Good coverage by aerial remote sensing is usually available
on military posts. On Fort Hood, aerial photographs processed by
a military intelligence detachment were available for this report.
A map of 41 CV 73 was traced directly from one frame of negative transparency, taken at an altitude of 4,000 feet. If aerial
imagery does not prove useful in individual site location, it can
be used for mapping, augmenting the 1:25,000 scale Department
of Defense Orthopicto maps already available.
Another advantage to archeology on military lands is homogeneity of ownership: it is all Federal land, and one need only
clear research with Federal authorities. A disadvantage on
military lands, however, is the delay inherent in operating
through two echelons of Federal authority, and two separate
legal systems.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
As of early 1977, the archeological survey of Fort Hood
located 105 sites, both registered and unregistered according to
the TARL system, and mostly within the boundaries of the

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

237

military reservation. Using surface data, it was possible to run a
tentative settlement pattern analysis, which tends to confirm the
results of investigations in other areas in central Texas. While
the immediate purpose of the survey -- to locate, describe,
register, and publish preliminary survey results -- was
achieved, Fort Hood investigators also tentatively confirmed
central Texas Archaic patterns of late period rockshelter occupation and increased bison resource exploitation. It is hoped that
future, more extensive research on Fort Hood will enable intensified dialogue among central Texas archeologists.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
A latecomer to the Fort Hood Archeological Society (FHAS), I must extend
gratitude to many former Society members whom I have not met. James Rodgers,
at this writing pursuing graduate studies in archeology at Arizona State University, cropped up most prominently within the early half of the FHAS site survey
folders. His perseverence in early administrative as wellas research efforts is to
be admired. Much gratitude goes to Les Dix, Camille Avery, and Sid Lyons, plus
other individuals too numerous to mention.
Of the individuals with whom I was fortunate to associate, James Shirah, Les
Herring, and James Baskin stand out as Society members capable of the most
Herculean efforts. Baskin returned to Tennessee following his departure from the
Army, and later moved to Florida. In both places he became deeply involved with
amateur archeological societies, while pursuing the field academically. While at
Fort Hood, Jim assisted with (41 CV 73) and initiated (41 CV 87) much field investigation. In his own reports, and when helping to put together some of the
prolific writings of Jim Shirah, he produced excellent scientific illustrations.
Without the labors of Les Herring, the FHAS correspondence and source files
would now be in chaos.
With contagious enthusiasm, Craig McKee carried the Society through a
trying period of membership turnover until late 1975. Following Craigâs departure,
several individuals helped to develop this paper: Michelle Pemberton and John
Tyler assisted with the photography, while Barbara Taylor drafted most of the illustrations. In the field, Rudy Purificato showed enthusiastic interest, while Pat
Tucker and Mark Rittenaur embarked on site-location surveys of their own.
"Outsiders" who provided the most encouragement have been Olin McCormick, Institute of Applied Sciences, North Texas State University, Denton; and
Bob Burleson, former President of the Texas Archeological Society.
Dr. Frederick L. Briuer, who assumed the position of Post Archeologist in
October, 1977, expressed much gratitude for our shaky start in the archeology of
Fort Hood. I especially thank him for his much-needed intellectual stimulation in
the last month and a half of my sojourn in the Army.
I apologize to those many former, and few current members of FHAS I failed
to mention.
