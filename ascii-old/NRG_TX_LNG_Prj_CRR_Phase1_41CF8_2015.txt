ABSTRACT
In January and February 2015, Natural Resource Group, LLC conducted cultural resource
investigations within a 625-acre tract in Cameron County, Texas. The studies are associated with
the proposed Texas LNG Brownsville LLC (Texas LNG) natural gas liquefaction, storage, and
export terminal project (Project). The work included Phase I archaeological survey on 277 acres
and supplemental testing at previously identified site 41CF8 within five areas that encompass 135
acres. A 25-acre area within the study tract that occurs on a clay dune known as Loma de la
Draga will not be impacted by the Project, and was not included in the field survey. The remaining
188 acres are mudflats that were also excluded from the archaeological survey. Historic
architectural survey was carried out within the 625-acre tract and the surrounding viewshed.
The goal of the Phase I effort was to assist the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
in meeting the requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended.
Site 41CF8 was reportedly occupied between A.D.1000 and A.D.1700, and is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The only data available prior to the current study is derived
exclusively from the surface or other disturbed contexts. Therefore, supplemental investigations
were initiated in order to investigate the site more thoroughly. The objective was to gather
sufficient information for designing and implementing a data recovery plan, should mitigation
efforts become necessary.
Other than 41CF8, no previously recorded archaeological sites or historic structures occur within
the Area of Potential Effects (APE), and no new cultural resources were identified during the
Phase I survey.
Based on the results of supplemental investigations at 41CF8, two loci (Areas 1 and 5) have been
designated as contributing elements to the overall significance of that resource. Since the
proposed project could have an adverse effect to those elements, data recovery investigations
are recommended for portions of Areas 1 and 5 (totaling 10 acres) before any ground disturbing
activities begin. In our opinion, Areas 2, 3, and 4 are non-contributing elements, and no further
work is recommended at those locations. Finally, with the exception of Areas 1 and 5, it is also
our opinion that construction can begin on the parcel without further consideration of cultural
resources.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1

OVERVIEW

This document presents the results that were achieved during cultural resource investigations on
a 625-acre tract in Cameron County, Texas. The studies were conducted by Natural Resource
Group, LLC (NRG) in January and February 2015, and are associated with the proposed Texas
LNG Brownsville LLC (Texas LNG) natural gas liquefaction, storage, and export terminal project
(Project). The investigations included Phase I archaeological survey on 277 acres and
supplemental testing within five loci that encompass 135 acres and have been previously mapped
as archaeological site 41CF8 (Figure 1.1-1). A 25-acre parcel within the study tract that occurs
on a clay dune known as Loma de la Draga will not be impacted by the Project, and was not
included in the Phase I study area. The remaining 188 acres are mudflats that were also excluded
from the archaeological survey.
The main site area for 41CF8 occurs on a dune known as Loma del Mesquite, but additional loci
were defined to the north. Site 41CF8 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP),
and was reportedly occupied between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1700. However, all of the data available
for the site prior to the current study is derived from the surface and other disturbed contexts.
Historic architectural survey was carried out within the 625-acre tract and the surrounding
viewshed within line of sight of the proposed undertaking.
The Project will include two liquefied natural gas (LNG) trains with a total capacity of four million
tons per annum (mtpa). The trains will be installed in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of the
construction of a single two mtpa LNG train, one 210,000 cubic meter LNG storage tank, and a
LNG carrier loading berth with a dredged slip connected to the Brownsville Ship Channel. Texas
LNG intends to construct Phase 1 upon receipt of necessary permits and authorizations. Phase
2 will be constructed at a later date based on market demand and will include an additional LNG
train and storage tank. During Phase 1, the Project will liquefy the natural gas and store and
transfer the LNG as needed to approximately 30-40 LNG carrier ships for export overseas.
The Project will require authorization under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) will be the lead federal agency. Therefore, the FERC is obligated
to meet the requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966,
as amended. The cultural resource investigations were intended to assist the FERC in complying
with the NHPA. Since 41CF8 is listed on the NRHP, additional testing was conducted within the
five areas that are part of that site in order to obtain sufficient information to design and implement
a data recovery plan, should mitigation efforts prove to be necessary.
1.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archaeological resources consists of the Project footprint
where ground-disturbing activities are possible. The APE for historic resources extends beyond
the Project site and encompasses areas within view of the proposed facility.
No new archaeological sites or historic structures were identified within the APE during the Phase
I survey, beyond the mapped boundary for 41CF8. No previously recorded historic structures
occur within the APE, and 41CF8 is the only previously recorded archeological resource within
the 625-acre tract.

The results of supplemental investigations at 41CF8 indicate the site was not inhabited or utilized
as extensively as previously thought. In addition, the age and cultural affiliation of specific
components cannot be determined with the information that is currently available. However, there
are two places within Areas 1 and 5 where stratified archaeological deposits are present.
Although the material encountered during the supplemental study primarily consists of faunal
remains, it is very likely that more extensive excavations would provide a much more robust view
of when the site was occupied, what types of activities took place during those occupations, and
how the inhabitants were integrated into local and regional interaction spheres. That research
potential could be enhanced by comparing and contrasting the archaeological record at 41CF8
with contact and mission period texts and first-hand accounts.
In our estimation, Areas 1 and 5 are contributing elements to the overall significance of 41CF8.
Therefore, in order to mitigate any adverse effects that could be caused by the construction,
operation, and maintenance of the proposed facility, we recommend that data recovery
investigations be conducted within those areas before any ground disturbing activities are
initiated. It is our opinion that Areas 2, 3, and 4 are non-contributing elements, and no further
work should be required at those locations.
It is also our opinion that there will be no effect to archaeological sites or historic structures within
the 495 acres located outside of Areas 1 and 5 that are associated with 41CF8. Likewise, there
will be no visual effect to historic properties within the area surrounding the Project.
Consequently, construction should be allowed to begin in those areas without further
consideration of cultural resources.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Project is located on the north shore of the Brownsville Shipping Channel approximately
5 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. The study tract consists of a prominent clay dune known as
Loma del Mesquite that is bordered on the west by wetlands and a few smaller dunes; the northern
southern, and eastern perimeter are part of the historic Laguna Madre shoreline (Figures 2.0-1–
2.0-4; see Figure 1.1-1). In more general terms, the project is located on the lower Texas coast
on a peninsula extending towards the man-made Brownsville Ship Channel. The Brownsville
Ship Channel, built in the 1930s, proceeds inland from Brazos Santiago Pass, which originated
as the natural outlet for waters of the Lower Laguna Madre to the Gulf of Mexico. Dredge spoil
from construction of the channel was placed on the north side, which—along with construction of
State Highway 48—cut the hydrological connections between the Gulf of Mexico and inland bays
like Little Laguna Madre and Bahia Grande. These bays became dry, barren slat/mudflats, except
in times of unusually high precipitation or storm surge. Bahia Grande has subsequently been the
subject of estuary restoration efforts in which tidal flows were restored after purchase by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service in 1998. The project area contains a landform type unique to the region:
clay dunes known as lomas. Lomas provide the greatest topographic relief in an otherwise flat
region, rising up to 30 feet above mean sea level (AMSL) in elevation above the surrounding nearsea-level terrain. The project is in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, an area of significant biological
diversity where plant and animal communities from the desert, coastal, temperate, subtropical,
and tropical zones converge (Britton and Morton 1989; Tunnel 2002a; U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers [USACE] 2013).
2.1

ECOLOGY

The project is located in the Western Gulf Coastal Plain ecoregion, a relatively flat strip of land,
generally 50 to 90 miles wide, adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. This Level III ecoregion is
characterized by relatively flat topography and mainly grassland potential natural vegetation.
Agricultural land use in the recent past has focused on rice, grain, sorghum, cotton, and soybean
cultivation. The narrow band of saline soils along the Gulf of Mexico historically was used as
range land. Urban and industrial land uses have risen dramatically in recent times, and oil and
gas production is now common (Griffith et al. 2007:73; Williams et al. 1977:1).
The specific Level IV ecoregion containing the project is the Laguna Madre Barrier Islands and
Coastal Marshes. This ecoregion consists of a hypersaline lagoon system, tidal marshes, vast
seagrass meadows, wide tidal mud flats, dunes, beaches, bays, estuaries, and a long, narrow
barrier island with a number of washover fans. The surface and bedrock geology of the area
consists of Holocene alluvium and beach-ridge and barrier-flat sands. As no rivers drain into the
Laguna Madre, high evaporation rates and low precipitation allow the shallow waters to become
increasingly salty, as water exchange with the Gulf of Mexico is limited. Inland bays like Little
Laguna Madre and Bahia Grande have become particularly hypersaline due to twentieth-century
hydrological modifications such as construction of the Brownsville Ship Channel that limited
inflow. This hypersalinity affects the types of resources present in the lagoon and its associated
bays. For example, the only strain of high-salinity adapted oysters in North America is found in
the lagoon. The commercial fisheries of this area were historically highly productive; but have
now given way to sport fisheries for species such as red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), black drum
(Pogonias cromis), and spotted sea trout (Cynoscion nebulosus). The food web of the Laguna
Madre is predominantly based on submerged aquatic vegetation—seagrass and algae. The
seagrass meadows and the sea life they support have been affected by navigational dredging,

hydrological modifications, agricultural contaminants, phytoplankton blooms, and other impacts
connected to modern development. On land, typical vegetation in barrier island grasslands
includes seacoast bluestem, gulfdune, paspalum, sea oats, bitter panicum, and numerous forbs;
coastal marshes contain marshhay cordgrass, bulrush, cattails, and sedges. The Laguna Madre
Barrier Islands and Coastal Marshes ecoregion has a more semi-arid climate and has less
precipitation (27 to 30 inches annually) compared to coastal areas to the north. There is extreme
variability in annual rainfall, and evapotranspiration is generally two to three times greater than
precipitation. Tropical storms and hurricanes can bring large changes to this dynamic ecoregion
(Griffith et al. 2007:85–87).
The mean tidal range is 1.21 feet and the diurnal range in 1.5 feet near Brownsville. The dominant
wave direction offshore is from the southeast, producing currents that travel north, transporting
sediments from the south. Since the construction of the Brownsville Ship Channel, limited tidal
exchange occurs with the Gulf of Mexico, and only weak, wind-driven currents prevail except at
times when hurricanes or tropical storms create high-energy winds and storm surges (Britton and
Morton 1989; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2013; USACE 2013). Likewise,
since the construction of reservoirs and large-scale irrigation projects on the Rio Grande, the
river’s discharge of sediment-laden fresh water has been reduced to 2 percent of its previous flow
(Brown et al. 1980). This has affected the dynamics of sedimentation versus shoreline erosion in
nearby coastal areas flanking Laguna Madre.
Since the last glacial maximum (ca. 20,000 B.P.), ocean levels have risen approximately 100 m,
inundating land surfaces that may have supported prehistoric habitation from the Late Archaic
period through the earliest time of human settlement. Sea level reached its present position
around 3000 B.P. The formation of Padre Island from submerged alluvial sediments enclosed the
lagoon system, and in conjunction with Mid Holocene flood events along the Rio Grande, helped
create the estuaries associated with the Laguna Madre. Eolian sediments from Padre Island were
transported landward over time, forming tidal flats in the lagoon. The Rio Grande Delta extends
into what were formerly the shallow waters of the Laguna Madre, providing a bulge on the
coastline characterized by a complex geography of meander streams, oxbow lakes, playa lakes,
wetlands, mudflats, and lomas. Sediment discharge from the Rio Grande has diminished over
the last 4,500 years, and has nearly ceased as a result of large-scale irrigation and flood-control
projects constructed along the river in the twentieth century. As a result, the delta is eroding and
subsiding, and Padre Island and Laguna Madre are retreating landward (Brown et al. 1980;
Tunnel 2002b:28–31). Through the Holocene, south Texas became increasingly arid with the
development of southeasterly wind patterns (Brown et al. 1980; Tunnel 2002b:34).
The area immediately inland from the coastal margin belongs to the Tamaulipan Biotic Province,
an area with uplands characterized as thorny brushlands, which extend north to the Balcones
fault, where vegetation transitions to prairie and oak-hickory stands. Because of a limestone
substrate, soils in this province do not hold moisture sufficient to support woodlands, except on
mountains. Coastal marshlands dominated by gulf cordgrass (Spartina spartinae) are flanked by
brushlands whose vegetation thins to the increasingly arid west. A different mix of species is
found on sandy versus clay soils, but mesquite is found on both (Judd 2002:44). Animals once
common in coastal areas of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province include numerous species of
waterfowl, dove, quail, whitetail deer, peccary, raccoon, opossum, cottontail, jackrabbit, skunk,
coyote, bobcat, jaguarundi, ocelot, and diamondback rattlesnake (Griffith et al. 2007:87; U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service 1970). Animal species historically found in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province,
but not elsewhere in Texas, include the white-nosed coati, jaguar, jaguarundi, Mexican spiny
pocket mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and collared peccary (Judd 2002:38–39). Huge numbers

of migratory birds pass through the Tamaulipan Biotic Province annually, either following the
western edge of the Gulf of Mexico, or flying across it (Judd 2002:58). The Padre Island National
Seashore has documented over 350 species of birds—among them a large overwintering
redhead duck population. Many reptiles have also been documented, including five species of
sea turtle: the leatherback, green, Kemp’s ridley, hawksbill, and loggerhead (Griffith et al.
2007:85–87; Tunnel 2002a).
On the Texas mainland, the coastal area flanking the Laguna Madre is described as the Gulf
Prairies and Marshes ecological area, which includes salt flats, marshes, and lomas (clay dunes).
This is the specific ecological zone of the Project. Salt flats are periodically inundated from high
tides and storm surges and feature saline soils that are barren except where adjacent to the
outwash slopes of lomas. Dominant plant species include shoregrass, saltwort (Batis maritima),
annual seepweed (Suaeda linearis), bushy sea-ox-eye (Borrichia frutescens), and glasswort
(Salicornia spp.). Mainland coastal marshes are dominated by gulf cordgrass, but have
occasional shrubs, such as mesquite, huisache, or retama. Lomas have abrupt topographic relief,
which creates unique habitats consisting of chaparral vegetation of thorny shrubs and low trees.
Dominant woody species include lotebush, coyotillo, mesquite, and huisache; and prickly pear,
pencil cactus, lime, prickyash, and Spanish dagger (Yucca treculeana) grow in open patches.
Buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) is dominant in the open areas on the upper crest of lomas,
and seepwillow (Baccharis salicifolia) and gutta-percha (Maytenus texana) grow in a narrow band
around the base of the slope (Judd 2002:46; USACE 2013). The character of the current plant
communities results from land use practices in the recent past. For example, mesquite was
present in the region prior to European settlement, but in lower volumes than during modern
times. Early settlers brought changes to the landscape and vegetation, with brush intensifying
near more heavily settled areas and on heavily used range lands. The overgrazing of cattle and
subsequent soil erosion, as well as suppression of range fires led to the expansion of mesquite
habitat (Doughty 1983:122–123; Fisher 1977:183; Judd 2002:44; Texas Parks and Wildlife n.d.).
2.2

SOILS

The project is located in the Rio Grande Embayment of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic province, where topography developed from sediments deposited in a mostly
marine environment and later uplifted and tilted toward the Gulf. Surface soils contain sand, silt,
mud, and clay deposited during the Holocene by alluvial, eolian, and marine processes (Brown et
al. 1980; Fenneman 1938:102). There is no true bedrock in the project region. The immediate
project vicinity lacks suitable lithic raw materials for stone tool making, but the uplands of the Rio
Grande Valley in the area of Laredo has abundant Uvalde chert, exploited prehistorically in large
quarry/procurement sites. El Sauz chert, a light gray, but sometimes colorful high quality chert,
occurs in outcrops in Starr County and was used by prehistoric peoples in Cameron County. Rio
Grande gravels also were available along the river itself (Hester 2004:129; Kumpe and
Kryzwonski 2009, 2010; Warren 1989).
The soil types found in the project area are listed in Table 2.3-1. Specific soils identified in
archaeological contexts are discussed in Chapter 5.
2.3

CLIMATE

The climate of Cameron County can be characterized as subtropical, with hot, humid summers,
and dry, mild winters. There are some winters in which the temperature does not fall below 32
degrees. The average annual total precipitation is about 26 inches. Most rain is associated with

thundershowers, and therefore is unevenly distributed (Williams et al. 1977:87). Hurricanes are
a frequent meteorological occurrence in the western Gulf, and can account for large shares of
annual precipitation. For example, between 1900 and 1979, 62 hurricanes affected the Laguna
Madre area of Tamaulipas. The volume of precipitation associated with these storms dramatically
affects the salinity of estuary environments (Tunnel 2002a:20). Although temperatures are warm
enough to permit plant growth year-round, the semiarid climate retards growth during dry spells.
Precipitation is highest closest to the coast and decreases inland (Judd 2002:40).

3.0 CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE
3.1

PREHISTORIC CONTEXT

It has long been recognized that the clay lomas of the south Texas coast were attractive locations
for prehistoric settlement (at least during particular time periods), given the presence of highly
visible shell middens of dwarf surfclam (Mulinia lateralis) on these landforms (Price 1958).
However, beyond Prewitt’s 1970 survey of selected locations in Cameron County under the
auspices of the Texas Historical Survey Committee (antecedent of the Texas Historical
Commission) and a handful of salvage excavations at sites like Ayala (41HG1) and Floyd Morris
(41CF2) (e.g., Campbell and Frizzell 1949; Collins et al. 1969), few professional archaeological
investigations have been carried out in the Lower Rio Grande Delta. Consequently, much of the
information presented in this section derives from surrounding regions, and is supplemented by
observations published on avocational collections from the area, most notably that of A.E.
Anderson, who collected from 196 sites in Cameron County, carefully recording the locations of
each site and cataloguing the specimens collected (Anderson 1932; MacNeish 1947, 1958;
Prewitt 1974).
Sites in Cameron County typically have very little lithic debitage (Prewitt 1974:59), which is not
surprising given the paucity of locally available material. Likewise, ceramics are not found in large
numbers. Shell artifacts and food remains provide the most common evidence of prehistoric
human activity in the Rio Grande delta. Shell artifacts include clam shell scrapers, conch
columella adzes and gouges, conch hammers, conch whorl scrapers, conch cup fragments,
columella awls, columella projectile points, shell disc beads (in various stages of manufacture),
tubular beads, Oliva and Marginella beads, shell gorgets, pendants, and various other types of
worked and engraved shell. Small pin-like drills are among the lithic tools found at Cameron
County sites, and were likely used in making shell beads and other shell artifacts. Drumfish
otoliths occur on most sites, along with other bone from fish and land mammals. Late prehistoric
sites vastly outnumber sites of earlier periods, based on diagnostics recovered (Prewitt 1974:59–
60).
The project area is situated at the junction of different ecological and cultural zones. To the
northeast, the Gulf Coastal Plain enjoys a more humid climate and an ecology of mixed
woodlands. The brush country of the South Texas Plains to the west is more arid and contains
resources adapted to grassland savannahs. The Gulf Coast south of the Rio Grande in
Tamaulipas, Mexico, becomes increasingly tropical to the south, with hypersaline lagoons, coastal
mangroves punctuated by hummocks, and brushland inland (Aten 1984; Britton and Morton 1989;
Hester 2004; Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988; Patterson 1995; Ricklis 2004; Story 1990).
Researchers have suggested that a distinct cultural boundary existed between the coastal margin
and inland areas of south Texas in Late Prehistoric times (Hester 1976; Patterson 1995).
Biological distinctions have even been identified between populations who occupied the coastal
plain and interior regions (Taylor and Creel 2012). Environmentally, the coastal margin of south
Texas comprises a zone about 25 km (16 mi) inland from the coast that covers the area influenced
by Gulf tidal flows, which affected the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable
ecological variability exists within this subregion, presenting a mosaic of resources differentially
exploited by prehistoric populations.

Paleoindian Period (12,000 to 6,000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back before
10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Meltzer 1989). Evidence
from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans were present in Eastern
North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al. 1990), while more recent
discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide robust evidence for human occupation in South
America as early as 14,600 B.P. (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Dillehay et al. 2008; Meltzer et al. 1997).
Some sites across North America have suggested the possible presence of humans prior to the
Clovis occupation. For example, the Gault site and the nearby Debra L. Friedkin site in central
Texas appear to have occupation levels dating at least 14,500 or perhaps 15,000 B.P. (Collins et
al. 1991; Gault School of Archaeological Research 2011; Waters et al. 2011). Levi Shelter, also
in central Texas, has yielded bone tools, chipped stone tools, numerous flakes, and bones of both
extinct and extant fauna along with a 12,800 B.P. radiocarbon date in two levels underlying a
Clovis stratum, but the complex stratigraphy at the site could be questioned (Alexander 1982;
Wyckoff 1999:349). Likewise, Bonfire Shelter in southwest Texas has produced a 12,460 ± 490
B.P. date from charcoal in a bone bed with circumstantial evidence of human activity but no stone
tools (Wyckoff 1999:349). Unfortunately, the data from these sites are not unequivocal due to
questions about dating, stratigraphic context, or identification of artifacts, and more research is
needed to firmly establish a pre-Clovis presence.
The earliest confirmed evidence for human activities in south Texas is represented by Clovis
occupations in the Paleoindian period (Patterson 1995). This period coincided with ameliorating
climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the extinction of
herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Accepted Paleoindian sites are recognized primarily
by distinctive projectile point forms. Most known Paleoindian projectile points are fluted, but styles
evolved through the period. Earlier fluted types include Clovis and Folsom (Bousman et al.
2004:60–61; Hester 2004:133). The late Paleoindian period (beginning ca. 10,500–10,000 B.C.)
is marked by unfluted lanceolate types that have received a number of type names such as
Golondrina-Barber, Angostura, Plainview, and Scottsbluff, among others. Discriminant function
analysis has been used for a number of basal measurements of lanceolate points to resolve
idiosyncratic labeling and typological usages (Bousman et al. 2004:23–28). Point types more
common in surrounding regions such as Dalton, San Patrice, Big Sandy, and Agate Basin types
can be found occasionally in south Texas sites (Collins 2004:117–118; Hester 2004:135–136;
Morrow 1996; Morrow and Morrow 1999).
Golondrina-Barber and Dalton points are
morphologically similar, and although they tend to be found in southwestern and northeastern
Texas, respectively, they may be related tool forms; their chronological relationship has not yet
been confidently established (Bousman et al. 2004:73; Hester 1986). A variety of stemmed points
has been found in stratigraphic context both above and below lanceolate points in Paleoindian
sites in west, central, and south Texas. Expanding stemmed Wilson points, for example, are
found in the southern part of the state, with a boundary observed at the southern Plains—which
apparently supported Paleoindian groups pursuing a different lifestyle (Bousman et al. 2002:988).
Nearest the project area, stemmed points from Paleoindian contexts have been typed as sidenotched Berclair points, from the finds at Berclair Terrace Locality 1 on Buckner Ranch in Bee
County, Texas (Bousman et al. 2004:28). Overlap exists in the periods in which different projectile
points were in use (Hofman and Graham 1998:96–116). Paleoindian points are frequently
associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts. Paleoindian groups are
often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals
that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement pattern.

The ephemeral nature of most Paleoindian sites suggests that these mobile hunters did not live
in permanent settlements. Domestic architectural evidence is scant, but a handful of sites have
revealed small circular post patterns and floor areas (e.g., Frison and Bradley 1980; Frison and
Stanford 1982). The distribution of exotic cherts used for Paleoindian artifacts and deposited
hundreds of miles from the lithic source areas reveals the geographic range of mobile groups
and/or their involvement in long-distance trade (Hofman and Graham 1998). All of the key, highquality lithic raw materials of the Great Plains were employed by Paleoindian groups,
demonstrating their knowledge of the landscape and its resources (Hofman and Graham
1998:118). It is assumed that the nomadic lifestyle pursued by these groups was punctuated by
periodic aggregations in which larger groups assembled to exchange information, hold
ceremonies, and meet potential mates (Hofman 1994). The artistry, ritual life, and symbolic
culture of Paleoindian peoples is difficult to access, given the limited nature of the archaeological
record. However, engraved stones have been found at the Gault site in central Texas, a bird
bone whistle or flute was found at the Jones-Miller site in Colorado, a painted bison skull has been
found at the Cooper bison kill site in northwestern Oklahoma, red ochre has been found in burial
contexts and suggests important ritual uses; these finds, along with the craftsmanship of fluted
points and other tools suggests aesthetic values, ritualistic behavior, and abstract communication
(Bement 1997; Breternitz et al. 1971; Collins et al. 1991; Frison 1991; Hofman and Graham
1998:96; Lahren and Bonnichsen 1974; Lemke et al. 2015; Stanford 1978).
Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in the region are known primarily
through the study of faunal remains. But subsistence almost certainly focused on the exploitation
of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the Paleoindian period. A broad-based
subsistence pattern has been modeled for all prehistoric time periods (Aten 1983; Fox 1983;
Patterson 1995). Remains of extinct Pleistocene animals have been found in some contexts
affiliated with early human populations in Texas (Bousman et al. 2004:76–78). For example, the
Murphy site (41MR62) at Lake O’ The Pines in Marion County (east Texas) yielded several
mastodon bones and a tooth in association with a Clovis projectile point (Stephenson 1950; Story
1990:184–185). On the High Plains, the Miami site (also known as Cowan Ranch) yielded five
partial mammoth skeletons with three in situ Clovis points (Holliday et al. 1994; Saunders 1980;
Sellards 1952). One site in east Texas yielding mammoth bones has been tentatively linked to a
Clovis group, supported by dating based on geologic evidence. Located on the Brazos River in
Brazos County, it is known as the Duewall-Newberry site (41BZ76). The remains in question,
although not found in association with any artifacts or features, exhibit characteristics that some
believe are indicative of Paleoindian activity (Story 1990:187). Closer to the project area in Willacy
County, an extinct form of tortoise was recovered from 41WY140 and dated to 9360 ± 415 B.P.
(Bousman et al. 1990). Other extinct reptiles were exploited at sites such as Horn Shelter 2
(41BQ46) in central Texas where various extinct turtle genera were among the faunal remains
(Story 1990:186). At Kincaid Shelter in Uvalde County west of San Antonio, Clovis and Folsom
points were found with a diverse array of faunal remains, including mammoth, extinct horse, and
extant species like raccoon, badger, slider and box turtles, alligator, and pocket mouse (Collins
et al. 1989).
Among Late Paleoindian sites in Texas, the transition to Holocene climate conditions is apparent
in the modern fauna represented in subsistence remains (Bousman et al. 2004:82–83). Sites like
Wilson-Leonard in central Texas with a Golondrina-Barber component reveal a diverse range of
species exploited, representing grassland, forest, and riparian habitats. Bison, jackrabbits,
cottontails, deer or pronghorn antelope, gophers, ground squirrels, rats, snakes, turtles, fish, and
birds were among the species represented at the site (Bousman 1998). At Baker Cave along the

Rio Grande, stratified components containing Golondrina points were dated to around 8,000 B.C.,
and were associated with a cooking pit that yielded walnut, persimmon, hackberry, mesquite,
acorns, Opuntia, and many other species of seeds and nuts, as well as small mammals such as
rabbit, squirrel, rat, gopher, mice, and fox. There were also fish, including sucker or carp, bass,
and sunfish, as well as numerous reptiles, including at least 16 different species of snakes (rat
snake, racer, bull snake, rattlesnake, king snake, and others). This diverse suite of plants and
animals showed that the peoples who used Golondrina points were intensive foragers who relied
on edible resources from many different ecological niches (Chadderon 1983; Hester 1983; Word
and Douglas 1970). Evidence from these sites does not indicate that Paleoindians were singleminded big-game hunters.
No Paleoindian sites have been found in Cameron County, which is not surprising given the
dynamic nature of the Rio Grande Delta in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene (Bousman et
al. 2004:72). One Clovis point was found by Anderson near the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife
Refuge (Anderson 1932). Paleoindian sites and isolated finds are, however, common throughout
central and interior portions of southern Texas, and include kill sites, quarries, and workshops
focused on high quality cryptocrystalline stone, tool caches, camp sites, and occasional ritual and
burial sites (Collins 2004:116). To the north of the project, the Buckner Ranch site in Bee County
yielded a wide range of extinct Pleistocene fauna (not all of which was associated with Paleoindian
artifacts), as well as Scottsbluff, Angostura, Midland, and Clovis points, unusual Berclair sidenotched Paleoindian points, flakes, cores, broken chipped stone tools, and burned rocks,
including ones associated with relatively intact hearths (Hester 1977; Nash 2001). One
Paleoindian site in the region with in situ occupational features is the Berger Bluff site in Goliad
County, where a hearth, a flint knapping area, and two small pits were discovered along with
various artifacts and faunal remains more than 8 m below surface. The deposits were dated to
9500 B.P. (Hester 2004:135). One site in south Texas with significant deeply stratified Paleoindian
deposits is the Johnston-Heller site (41VT15) on Rocky Creek, where Clovis, Plainview,
Golondrina, and Early Stemmed Lanceolate (“Victoria”) points were found, along with elongate,
bifacial Clear Fork tools in components extending at least 4 m below surface (Birmingham and
Hester 1976). Another Paleoindian occupation in Victorian County was discovered at the Morhiss
site (41VT1) on the Guadalupe River, where Golondrina and Midland lanceolate projectile points
were found; bones of extinct Pleistocene animals at the site appear to have been redeposited by
floodwaters (Campbell 1976). West of the project on the Rio Grande, a significant Paleoindian
occupation was recorded at Bonfire Shelter (Bone Bed 2), where Folsom and Plainview points
have been found with the butchered remains of extinct bison (around 120 individuals) from at
least three large drive hunts in which the animals were herded over a cliff above the shelter; the
materials were dated to around 10,000 B.P. and constitute the earliest and southernmost buffalo
jump known in North America (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Another important Paleoindian site in
south Texas is the Kincaid Shelter near the Sabinal River in Uvalde County. Kincaid Shelter
features deposits spanning the entire prehistoric sequence, including Paleoindian, and has
yielded bones from a wide range of now extinct species along with Clovis and Folsom points in
different strata and an unusual stone pavement that apparently covered muddy areas within the
shelter (Collins et al. 1989).
3.1.2

Archaic Period (6,000 B.C. to A.D. 800)

Evidence from the southern Plains suggests that the late Pleistocene–early Holocene transition
in the broader region encompassing south Texas involved a decrease in precipitation, which
impacted surface runoff and spring discharge (Holliday 1995; Johnson 1986). As result, some
streams and lakes dried up, and their associated plant and animal communities changed. Some

have argued that environmental changes in the early Holocene forced prehistoric populations to
turn to new resources and new technologies and approaches to subsistence. Some have argued
that drought conditions—particularly in the Middle Archaic—tethered populations to freshwater
sources. Archaeological information from central Texas suggests that the transition from
Paleoindian to Archaic lifeways took place over a 1,000–2,500-year period, during which time
local groups experimented with new projectile point forms, settlement and mobility strategies, and
subsistence practices (Bousman et al. 2002). Sites dating to the Early and Middle Archaic are
rare in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and little is known about this period from locally excavated
data. Late Archaic occupations are more common, but are often found at multicomponent sites
with mixed deposits. For example, the Sardinas Resaca site (4HG118) in Hidalgo County was
found during construction of a drainage ditch, at which time flakes, cores, a scraper, a biface, two
Tortugas dart points, burned rock and burned clay lumps, animal bone, mussel shell, cockle shell
and freshwater mussels were found; the Tortugas dart points suggested a Late Archaic
occupation, but a Late Prehistoric component was present as well (Hall et al. 1987).
The internal chronology of the Archaic in south Texas is poorly known; however, the Early Archaic
is generally dated to 6000–2500 B.C., the Middle Archaic to 2500–400 B.C., and the Late Archaic
to 400 B.C.–A.D. 800 (Black 1989; Hester 1980, 2004:137; Hester et al. 1989; Story 1985).
Perhaps the earliest Archaic point types identified in the region include Martindale, Uvalde, Baker,
and Bandy corner-notched forms, followed by basal notched types such as Bell and Andice
(Hester 2004:136–137). These Early Archaic types give way to the Middle and Late Archaic
Unstemmed Point Tradition, involving the production of triangular, tear-drop, and lanceolate dart
points labeled as the Early Triangular, Tortugas, Abasolo, Carrizo, Matamoros, Refugio, and
Catan types, and which appear in the archaeological record of south Texas for thousands of
years. Tubular stone pipes are also believed to date to the Middle Archaic and have been found
on both sides of Falcon Reservoir (Hester 2004). Based on investigations conducted in
Tamaulipas, Mexico, MacNeish defined the Repelo and Abasolo archaeological complexes as
Middle-Late Archaic manifestations in the lower Rio Grande (MacNeish 1947:2–3). Repelo
components were observed stratigraphically below more recent Abasolo components. Large
triangular, unstemmed dart points characterize the lithic inventory of both the Abasolo and Repelo
complexes.
Dart points associated with the Late Archaic include small, corner- or side-notched types such as
Shumla, Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Montell, Fairland, and Ellis. Other lithic tools diagnostic of this
period in south Texas include Olmos bifaces, Nueces scrapers, and Corner Tang bifaces (Hester
et al. 1989:51). One stemmed dart point type, Morhiss, is named for the Morhiss Mound site
(41VT1) site near Victoria to the north of the project area and is generally found in the eastern
portion of the South Texas Plains (Suhm et al. 1954). These simple projectile point forms have
been interpreted as the result of limited lithic resource availability. Studies of the Brazos River
basin north of Austin focusing on multiple components extending from the Late Paleoindian
through the entire Archaic period show a progressive reduction in the size of exploited territories
over time, reflected in the types of lithic raw materials employed (Bousman et al. 2002:986–987).
Some Archaic sites in the region—particularly Late Archaic sites—are located in proximity to lithic
raw materials sources, including upland Uvalde gravels and terraces with Rio Grande gravels. In
areas where such raw materials were not readily available, people made use of stream pebbles,
gravels, silicified wood, and quartzite as tool stone (Hester 2004:142). There is some evidence
of increased trade during the Late Archaic, notably with groups in central Texas who could provide
high-quality Edwards chert (Hester 2004:142; Hester and Barber 1990; Miller 1993; Turner and
Hester 1993). Marine shell was also obtained by interior groups during this period.

Recent reanalysis of two mortuary sites in the Rio Grande Delta formerly assigned to the Late
Prehistoric period produced Middle and Late Archaic radiocarbon dates for some of the remains;
this work demonstrated that a specialized shell industry in which beads and other ornaments were
produced originated in the Archaic period and persisted through European contact (Terneny
2005). One Cameron County site previously assigned to the Late Prehistoric Brownsville
Complex is the Floyd Morris site (41CF2), where Middle Archaic flexed burials, contained human
bone artifacts and beads, perforated canine teeth, Oliva shell beads and tinklers with perforated
canine teeth, Marginella shell beads, Busycon conch shell pendants, conch columella beads, and
disk-shaped conch columella beads (Terneny 2005:202). Inland sites in south Texas also provide
evidence of mortuary elaboration in the Archaic period, with the use of exotic grave goods such
as boatstones, stone gorgets, corner-tang knives, stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell
beads and pendants becoming especially prevalent in the Late Archaic. Recent discoveries at
the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98), to the north of the project area in Victoria County, reveal the
emergence of organized and relatively elaborate mortuary practices on the Texas coastal plain
around 5,300–4,200 B.C. Grave goods found with burials at the site include winged bannerstones,
perforated plummets, grooved stones of limestone and quartzite, and an array of marine-shell
artifacts of types different from those recovered from well-known Late Archaic cemeteries in
southern Texas (Ricklis 2009).
In nearby inland portions of south Texas, Archaic people relied on a diverse subsistence base
composed of small game, land snails, mussels, and wild plants. It is assumed that groups relied
on marine resources to a great degree in the Rio Grande Delta during the Archaic period, although
excavated data is scarce. To the north, archaeological studies at sites around Corpus Christi and
Nueces bays show that prehistoric groups inhabited the shoreline as early as 7,500 B.P. (Ricklis
1993, 1995; Ricklis and Cox 1991). Once sea level had become fairly stable in the mid Holocene
by 5,900 B.P., many archaeological sites are found on the south and central Texas coast. Sites
of this period contain dense shell middens of species such as oyster and Rangia flexuosa clams,
and there is evidence for fishing during this period, with species like black drum, red drum, spotted
seatrout, Atlantic croaker, and saltwater catfish represented among the food remains at such
sites. The number and variety of discarded tools at these shell midden sites indicate that they
were often occupied long enough for a range of activities to take place. Chipped stone dart points,
scrapers, and shell tools like clamshell knives/scrapers and net weights suggest a variety of
hunting, fishing, and food processing activities (Ricklis 1993, 1995).
Across south Texas, the appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an
expanded groundstone assemblage (especially woodworking tools such as adzes and gouges),
and a general simplification of projectile point form are hallmarks of the Archaic. Settlement
patterns in inland portions of south Texas included base camps concentrated along rivers and
streams where the richest array of resources were available (Black 1989; Hester 1980, 2004:139;
Hester et al. 1989). An example of the riverine settlement focus is the Morhiss Mound site
(41VT1) on the Guadalupe River. The site was occupied repeatedly throughout the Archaic
period, creating deeply stratified deposits on the floodplain terrace remnant where the site is
located. Ovens lined with cooking stones or baked clay balls reveal Archaic cooking technology
(Campbell 1976). Cooking stone features using sandstone or other materials are common at
Archaic sites of the South Texas Plains (e.g., Quigg et al. 2000; 2002). Plant foods recovered
from sites in the region include mesquite, acacia, oak, and hackberry, at least from the Middle
Archaic onward, which may be when mesquite first became established in the area. Common
animal foods include deer, rodents, rabbits, turtles, fish, lizards, snakes, land snails, and mussels
(Hester 2004:139–141). Isotope analysis of human remains from the Morhiss site has shown that

people had a very diverse diet that included both freshwater and marine resources, as well as
terrestrial plants and animals. The people who frequented the site apparently controlled or made
use of a large territory that extended to the coast (Hard and Katzenberg 2011). Other sites in the
region also have documented the broad spectrum hunting and foraging that characterized Late
Archaic subsistence practices (e.g., Hudler et al. 2002).
3.1.3

Late Prehistoric Period (A.D. 800 to 1500)

The Late Prehistoric is recognized archaeologically by the widespread adoption of ceramic
technology and the appearance of small projectile points like Scallorn and Edwards associated
with the innovation of bow and arrow technology (Hester 1981). Biological evidence (dental traits)
suggests that there may have been an influx of new population into the Coastal Plain in the Late
Prehistoric period, which could account for the introduction of bow and arrow technology (Taylor
and Creel 2012:110–111). Along the coastal margin of Texas, use of the atlatl was generally
discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though this technology continued to be used in
the inland subregion alongside the bow and arrow. Smaller “dart” point types such as Ensor,
Matamoros, Catan, and Zavala continue to be found occasionally on inland Late Prehistoric sites,
and may have been used on arrows or they may have been found and recycled by Late Prehistoric
hunters (Aten 1967; Ensor and Carlson 1991; Hester 2004:143; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson
1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). Elsewhere, agriculture took on a central role in subsistence practices,
but it was never embraced in south Texas.
Late Prehistoric triangular chipped stone projectile points found in Cameron County and
Tamaulipas, Mexico, are more numerous than bifaces associated with other prehistoric periods
(Prewitt 1974:59). The types MacNeish (1958:68–70) reported for Tamaulipas included
Matamoros, Fresno, Starr, and Cameron, the latter referring to smaller points often made of glass,
and thus associated with the Protohistoric period. Conch columella projectile points are
apparently more common on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande Delta (based on Anderson’s
extensive surface collections) along with antler perforators and pitted stone anvils, whereas
conical pumice pipes were only found on the American side, providing the basis for MacNeish
(1947:6–7, 1958:186–192) to define the Late Prehistoric Barril complex for the south and the
Brownsville complex for the north side of the river. Both complexes are associated with red ochre
in burials, Huastecan influenced ceramics, shell disc beads, Marginella and Oliva shell beads,
Oliva shell tinklers with perforated canine teeth, rectangular (and other shaped) conch pendants,
shell scrapers, hooks, and plugs, bone awls, tubular bone beads, artifacts made from human
bone, hammerstones, chipped stone humpback scrapers, small pin-like drills, and triangular
projectile points. The Brownsville complex was believed to be contemporary with late Huastecan
assemblages to the south in eastern Mexico and the Rockport focus of Baffin Bay to the north
(Hester 1969a, 1969b, 2004; Prewitt 1974:62). Based on diagnostic pottery and projectile points,
it was thought that the Brownsville Complex dated to approximately A.D. 1250–1500 (Anderson
1932; Hester 1969b, 1969c, 2004; MacNeish 1947). Recent reanalysis and radiocarbon dating
of burials from sites in Hildalgo and Cameron counties has questioned the utility of the Brownsville
complex concept (Terneny 2005). ‘Brownsville Complex’ materials were associated with burials
dated to the Middle and Late Archaic as well as the Late Prehistoric periods, illustrating the longterm cultural persistence of a shell industry in the Rio Grande Delta, and revealing the fact that
Brownsville artifacts do not serve as clear-cut temporal markers (Terneny 2005). Further
research is needed to differentiate the material assemblages of Archaic and Late Prehistoric
occupations in the Rio Grande Delta.

Five complete ceramic vessels that Anderson found with burials were later identified as Tancol
Polychrome, a Huastecan type (Campbell 1960:163; Ekholm 1944:433). These Huastecan
vessels were likely trade wares; however Huastecan influences are seen in ceramics of the
Brownsville complex. Similarities between pottery from these two areas includes decorative
elements such as parallel straight lines and bands, scallops, triangles, concentric circles with a
central dot, and animal figurines (Mason 1935). Other exotic artifacts from the south include
obsidian for stone tools, and jadeite for ornaments (Anderson 1932; MacNeish 1947). Most
ceramics in the Rio Grande Delta are similar to Rockport series wares, and are found in
association with triangular projectile points, small circular scrapers and shell ornaments (Prewitt
1974:61–62). Rockport ceramics have rounded or pointed bases, take the form of beakers, jars,
bottles (or olla), simple bowls, shallow bowls, and globular bowls, and feature storage and cooking
wares with plain or incised surface treatment, and thin-walled serving wares with slip decoration,
such as black-on gray or rare polychrome examples (Weinstein 2002).
Throughout most of Texas, pottery makes its first appearance during the Late Prehistoric period,
but ceramics appeared earlier on the northern portion of the Texas Gulf coast. It was once thought
that ceramics appeared at the time of the Spanish missions in south Texas or with the Toyah
horizon at the earliest. However, ceramics have been found in south Texas in association with
Matamoros points in contexts thought to date to A.D. 860–1250 (Creel et al. 1979; Hester
2004:143). The Toyah horizon is marked by Leon Plain bone-tempered pottery, large thin bifaces,
Perdiz arrow points, small end scrapers, beveled knives, flake perforators, ceramic figurines,
marine and freshwater mussel shell ornaments, tubular bird bone beads, bison bone objects, and
some pipes (Black 1986).
The Toyah phase of far southern and central Texas is thought to represent a Late Prehistoric
incursion of highly mobile bison hunters. The group likely consisted of Plains peoples from the
north who migrated into Texas to exploit bison herds following the expanding grasslands as the
climate ameliorated at this time. During the 1300s–1700s, the northern hemisphere experienced
generally cooler and wetter conditions commonly referred to as the Little Ice Age. Although the
climatic impacts were not uniform, the archaeological record from sites like Hinojosa on Chiltipin
Creek offers corroborating evidence that the South Texas Plains did indeed experience wetter
and somewhat cooler conditions. As bison moved into new grasslands in South Texas, hunters
likely followed from the north. Some sites in south Texas show that Toyah populations relied on
a wide range of resources beyond bison; deer and antelope were exploited intensively at some
sites along with small game, turtles, land snails, and mussels, and plant foods like persimmons.
These groups made tools from local lithic raw materials so if they were indeed immigrants from
the north, they came to stay (Black 1986; Collins 2004:125; Hester 2004:144–145; Highley 1986).
Late Prehistoric groups of the Rio Grande Delta likely interacted with Toyah phase peoples upriver
in the Rio Grande Valley, minimally for the purpose of exchange.
Perttula (2001) described the varied mortuary traditions of south Texas, defining the Rio Grande
Delta as one area of discrete practices within the larger region for which the concept of the
Brownsville complex has been applied. As originally defined (MacNeish 1947, 1958), Brownsville
complex cemeteries and isolated burials are typically not associated with habitation areas; the
majority of the burials are flexed although bundle burial occur as well, and they have large
amounts of grave goods, including human bone artifacts, bone beads, perforated canine teeth,
Oliva shell beads and tinklers, Marginella shell beads, Busycon conch shell pendants, and
columella beads. Some items typically found with burials in the Rio Grande Delta are found
elsewhere in south Texas (Perttula 2001:14).

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF CAMERON COUNTY AND THE RIO GRANDE
DELTA

3.2.1

Native Americans after European Contact (A.D. 1500 to 1900)

For the most part, protohistoric and early historic Indian archaeological sites in south Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Hester 2004:129; Story 1990:258).
Shipwrecked Spaniard, Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, who traveled through the area in the 1530s
noted the density of Indian populations in the Rio Grande Delta (Salinas 1990:3–4; Suhm et al.
1954:135). At least 49 distinct groups were reported in the Rio Grande Delta area in 1747 during
Escandón’s survey of the area, and there may have been others who were never recorded.
Through the eighteenth century, additional named groups appear in Spanish documents.
Eventually as their numbers dwindled, native names dropped away, and chroniclers began using
Spanish names referring to geographic locations where remnant populations had coalesced or
descriptive attributes of the people. Among the Coahuiltecans in the region, some of those
mentioned on the north side of the Rio Grande in 1747 were the Cootajam, Coucuguyapem,
Hueplapiaguilam, Hunpuzliegut, Imasacuajulam, Parammatuga, Perpepug, Peumepuem,
Pexpacux, Segujulapem, Sepinpacam, Tlanchugin, and Tunlepem. Those noted in coastal areas
north of the Rio Grande Delta—and most relevant to the current project—include Apatin,
Ippantapajeis, Nacuap, Pajasequeis or Carrizos, and Zuncal. The area was apparently sparsely
populated at the time (Salinas 1990:28–72; Thompson 1997).
The people of southern Texas have traditionally been labeled “Coahuiltecans,” but in reality, they
included Coahuilteco speakers as well as at least six other language groups (Goddard 1979;
Hester 2004:129; Johnson and Campbell 1992; Kelley 1959:283; Newcomb 1961; Rueckling
1955; Salinas 1990:142–147; Swanton 1915, 1940). The Coahuiltecans occupied south Texas
below the Edwards Plateau to the Gulf Coast as well as parts of the Mexican states of Coahuila,
Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas east of the Sierra Madre Oriental, where they pursued a hunting
and gathering way of life. They traded with the sedentary Huastecs who lived along the Pánuco
River in the northeast portion of modern Mexico and with other groups in central Texas
(Skowronek and Lovett 2014). To the north, the Karankawa tribes occupied the central Texas
coast from Matagorda Bay at least as far south as Corpus Christi Bay (Ricklis 1996), and the
Attakapa-speaking Akokisa probably inhabited the Galveston Bay area (Aten 1983). The specific
identities of the groups in the region encompassing the project remain obscure and a great deal
more ethnohistorical and archaeological research is needed in order to clarify this issue.
Coahuiltecan cultural identity was transformed in the eighteenth century through missionization,
enslavement, and intermarriage with Spanish colonial settlers. Initially, conflicts with Spanish
colonists inland in Nuevo Leon pushed Indian groups towards the Gulf coast. The Spaniards
responded with intensified colonization efforts along the coast that by the middle of the eighteenth
century permitted free travel between Texas and other parts of New Spain without harassment
by independent, hostile Indians. Suffering from periodic epidemics, high infant mortality rates,
and conflicts with other groups—notably the Lipan Apache and the Comanche, the Coahuiltecan
groups lost their land and abandoned traditional cultural practices as they were absorbed into
Spanish colonial settlements. Coahuiltecan groups—the Carrizo and Garza Indians—temporarily
took over Camargo in 1812 as part of the Mexican Independence movement, but were forced to
flee within two months to the interior of Nuevo Santander under assault from royalist forces and
their Indian allies. This repression spawned a short-lived indigenous uprising that was quickly put
down by royalist forces. Coahuiltecans were no longer a recognizable cultural entity by the mid
nineteenth century, and had become Roman Catholic farmers and ranchers (Campbell 1983:345–

100).
As the Coahiultecans were becoming integrated into Spanish colonial society, other Indian groups
were pushing into south Texas. The Lipan Apache were Athapaskan speakers who moved east
into west Texas in the sixteenth century (Minor 2009). The Comanche were Uto-Aztecan
speakers who split from the Shoshone in the late seventeenth century, and moved from eastern
Wyoming into the Southern Plains of Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Kansas in
the eighteenth century (Cash and Wolff 1974:2–3; Lacey 2010:14). In the early seventeenth
century, after initial Lipan Apache migration into west Texas, the Comanche entered the region.
Soon, the two groups were in competition to control the southern plains and bison they supported.
The Lipan were outnumbered by the Comanche, and after suffering many casualties, were
displaced to the south. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, violence continued
between the Comanche and the Lipan, consisting of small-scale raids and taking of captives
(Hester 1980; Minor 2009; Reeve 1946). The Lipan also launched periodic raids against Spanish
colonial settlements. San Antonio was a particular target after the founding of the presidio and
missions, and regular attacks continued into the 1770s (Minor 2009:113; Valerio-Jimenez
2013:41).
In the 1820s, the Lipan Apache forged an alliance with Anglo settlers north of the Nueces River
as protection from continued Comanche aggression. Through this decade and into the 1830s,
the Lipan continued attacks on the remaining Coahuiltecans in the lower Rio Grande, including
the Carrizo and Garza Indians in the area of Camargo and Mier (Valerio-Jimenez 2013:47). After
Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, the Republic considered the Lipan Apache to
be a useful buffer against Mexican incursions. The government of the Republic of Texas entered
into a number of treaties with the Lipan Apache beginning in 1838. These treaties promised lands
and protection from the Comanche in return for an end to cattle rustling. The treaties were
repeatedly broken and Texas leaders in the 1840s began pursuing Indian removal policies. Many
Lipan moved to Mexico and collaborated with the Mescalero Apache in destructive raids on Texas
ranches. After statehood, the 1851 San Saba Treaty forced the remaining Lipan and other Indian
tribes in Texas onto reservations. In 1873, U.S. troops launched an assault on the Lipan in Mexico
to end the cross-border raiding. Many Lipan were killed, and the remainder were deported to the
Mescalero reservation in the Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico (Hester 1980:54; Minor
2009:140–177; Opler 1983:21; Schilz 1987; Watson 1994:15).
3.2.2

European Settlement in the Colonial Period

The first European incursion into what is now Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez de Pineda
explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca was shipwrecked
near Galveston Bay, lived among Texas Indians for 7 years, and then crossed coastal Texas
south to the Rio Grande Valley, before walking nearly to the Gulf of California and then along the
Pacific coast, south to Mexico City. After attempts to establish settlements in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley by Gonzalo de Ocampo (1523), Sancho de Canielo (1528), and Pedro de Alvarado
(1535) proved unsuccessful, and when the subsequent expeditions of Hernando de Soto and
Vasquez de Coronado failed to locate any wealthy kingdoms in Texas, the Spanish turned their
focus to New Mexico and the upper Rio Grande, and sought only to maintain their sovereignty
over the region and block encroachment by other European powers. Jacinto García de
Sepulveda was dispatched in 1638 to explore the area that would become Cameron County; his
expedition crossed the Rio Grande near Mier and marched down the north bank of the river as
far as the site of present Brownsville. It was not until La Salle claimed the Mississippi Valley for

the French that the Spanish began to consider establishing settlements in Texas as a buffer
against European encroachment. In seeking out La Salle’s Texas settlement, in 1687, Alonso De
León crossed the Rio Grande and proceeded north through the future Cameron County, probably
as far north as Baffin Bay. In 1747, Miguel de la Garza Falcón explored the north bank of the Rio
Grande from the site of modern Eagle Pass to the mouth of the river, deeming the area unsuitable
for settlement based on the limited availability of fresh water.
Although permanent settlements were not established until the early eighteenth century, Spanish
parties crossed through southern Texas from time to time during the late seventeenth century,
leaving behind diseases that devastated the native populations. Among the Coahuiltecan groups,
bands of 100 or more were reduced by as much as 90 percent by disease. Those who survived
organized themselves into smaller groups of 10–20 members and scavenged for food in the
increasingly dry and unforgiving region. When the Spanish established fortified missions in the
San Antonio valley beginning in 1718, Christianity attracted adherents among the remnants of the
Coahuiltecan cultural groups, who sought food and refuge. The Spanish mission system was
intended to secure the region for Spain and block French and English influence, as much as it
was an effort at spreading the gospel. The population of missionized Indians dwindled as
epidemic disease and attacks from rival groups took their toll (Chipman 1992; Davis 1984; Garza
and Long 2010a; Richardson 1967:21–31; Salinas 1990:3–6; Story et al. 1990:322; Thompson
1997).
The Spanish crown tasked José de Escandόn with colonizing the area along the Rio Grande. In
1746, he was appointed “conquistador and governor of Nuevo Santander,” the larger region
containing the Lower Rio Grande Valley. He thus began the process of settling the area that
continued throughout his 23‐year‐long career. He founded 23 settlements in all, four of which
were located south of the river in or near present‐day Hidalgo County. These settlements,
including Reynosa (1749), Camargo (1749), Mier (1750), and Revilla, or present‐day Guerrero
(1752), were different from traditional Spanish colonization efforts in that they were not centered
on a strong military and/or religious presence, but relied instead on civil defense and governance.
Some settlers migrated north of the river. In 1781, Spanish authorities granted 59 leagues of land
on the north bank of the river, including all of the future site of Brownsville, to José Salvador de
la Garza, who established a ranch about 16 miles northwest of the site. A number of other grants
were made in the area in the 1780s. Following Mexican Independence in 1821, additional land
grants were made, but the region remained sparsely populated at the time of the Texas
Revolution. Before 1836, the area that would become Cameron County was part of the state of
Tamaulipas, but following Texas Independence, it was claimed as part of the new republic and
included in San Patricio County. Mexico, however, continued to claim the territory, and through
the late 1830s and early 1840s, Mexican rancheros ranged their herds across the much of the
area. By 1840, there were isolated settlements in the region, but most were concentrated along
the Rio Grande (Garcia 2010a; Garza and Long 2010a; Miller 1980; Salinas 1990:17–20;
Thompson 1997).
3.2.3

Contested Territory following Texas Independence

After Texas declared independence, the new republic and the Mexican government both claimed
the territory between the Rio Grande and Nueces River. The lack of governance in the area left
many residents vulnerable to attack by Indians and as well as armed Mexican and Texan forces.
Complicating matters, insurgents in northern Mexico in 1840 declared independence for the
Republic of the Rio Grande, which included the Mexican states of Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua,

Coahuila, and Tamaulipas, as well as the Lower Rio Grande and south Texas north to the Nueces
River. The rebellion was quickly put down by Mexican forces within the year (Thompson 1997;
Vigness 2010). In the project vicinity, a naval battle between Texas and Mexican forces in 1836
resulted in the sinking of the Mexican navy gunboat “Nicolas Bravo” in the Brazos Santiago area
(Bates 2004).
As Texas transitioned from an independent republic to part of the United States in 1845, the
conflict over the boundary with Mexico erupted into full-scale warfare. In early 1846, U.S. troops
under the command of Gen. Zachary Taylor were deployed to the disputed territory. After a brief
skirmish with Mexican irregulars at Arroyo Colorado, Taylor’s troops set about constructing
defenses on the Rio Grande across from Matamoros. The temporary fortifications were originally
called Fort Texas. Before the fort was completed, Gen. Taylor led a detachment to the American
base at Port Isabel, which was the supply point for the lower Rio Grande, to head off Mexican
forces en route. In his absence, Taylor left Major Jacob Brown in command of the fort and the
7th U.S. Infantry posted there. Fort Texas came under Mexican artillery bombardment, followed
by an infantry assault that was repulsed. Major Brown was mortally wounded in subsequent
artillery fire. Upon learning of Major Brown’s death, Taylor ordered the fort named after him and
pursued the Mexican army into Matamoros. Two other Mexican War battles were fought in
Cameron County: the battle of Palo Alto (May 8, 1846) north of Brownsville and the battle of
Resaca de la Palma (May 9, 1846) north of Matamoros, both of which resulted in American
victories and allowed U.S. troops under Gen. Taylor to capture Matamoros. All subsequent
fighting in the Mexican War took place within Mexico. Fort Brown remained after the war, and the
community that grew up around it was known as Brownsville (Garza and Long 2010a;
Leatherwood 2010; National Park Service 2015; Sanchez 2010; Thompson 1997).
With Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo ending the Mexican War, the land between the Rio Grande
and Nueces officially became U.S. soil. Ten days after the treaty was signed, on February 12,
1848, the Texas legislature created Cameron County, which included parts of the future Hidalgo,
Willacy, Kenedy, and Brooks counties, from land that had been part of the larger San Patricio
County. Santa Rita, 5 miles downstream from Fort Brown, was made the county seat. In the
same year, the town of Brownsville was established just west of the fort. In an election in
December 1848, it was chosen to replace Santa Rita as the county seat. Cameron County
achieved its modern boundaries in 1921 (Garza and Long 2010a, 2010b; Long and Sinko 2008).
3.2.4

The Civil War and Its Aftermath in the Lower Rio Grande

The lower Rio Grande became a focal point in the Civil War because of its unique geography,
and the opportunities it presented for circumventing Union blockades of Southern ports. Trade
had been important to the economy of the region, stretching back into its early history. An early
venture on the Rio Grande was launched by Henry Austin, a cousin of Stephen F. Austin, who
established steamer service on the river in 1829; however, the operation ultimately was not
profitable. After Texas Independence, merchants on both sides of the river sought to avoid paying
high Mexican duties on imports by shipping goods to the Brownsville vicinity and then smuggling
them across the Rio Grande. During the Mexican War, entrepreneurs Richard King, Mifflin
Kenedy, and Charles Stillman had set up a transport company to deliver American troops and
supplies up the river. After the war, King and Kenedy bought out Stillman, and under the company
called M. Kenedy and Company established a virtual monopoly on river transportation. At one
time, they operated 26 boats on the Rio Grande. Much of the business in 1849 and 1850 came
from California-bound gold-seekers who landed at Port Isabel to take the military road (known as
the Gila route) to the west. Some would-be miners ended up settling in the area. Brownsville

and other communities also received refugees from Matamoros at the end of the Mexican War.
Investing the proceeds of their business ventures in land, King and Kenedy would become the
largest ranchers in the area (Garza and Long 2010a, 2010b; Hilbun and Koltermann 2002;
Thompson 1997).
Despite a number of cholera and yellow fever epidemics that struck the area, the population grew
rapidly, and by 1850 Cameron County had 8,451 inhabitants. Brownsville soon replaced
Matamoros as the leading trade center for northern Mexico. The town was a cosmopolitan, multiethnic community. The 1850 census recorded a population of 519 in Brownsville, two-thirds of
whom were from the East Coast of the United States; most of the remainder were Mexican, Irish,
French, English, and German. A large percentage of the residents were fluent in several
languages, including Spanish, English, French, and German (Garza and Long 2010a, 2010b).
The Civil War brought increased prosperity to Brownsville and Cameron County. The King and
Kenedy ranches supplied meat to the Confederacy. They also imported lead from Mexico for
ammunition and helped ship cotton. The county also benefited as a shipping hub for the South.
After the Union Navy implemented a blockade of most Southern ports, the South sought an
alternate route by which to ship cotton to Europe and obtain ammunition, medicines, and other
war supplies. The Confederates initially shipped goods overland to the Brazos Santiago Pass
and from there to the neutral port of Bagdad on the opposite side of the Rio Grande in Mexico.
But after Union forces captured Port Isabel, the caravans of cotton, salt, and other goods were
directed inland to Brownsville. To stem this trade, in November 1863 federal troops marched on
Brownsville. The outgunned Confederates abandoned Fort Brown, blew it up with 8,000 pounds
of explosives, and withdrew. With Brownsville under Union control, King, Kenedy, and other
supporters of the Confederate cause moved across the river and continued their trade in Southern
goods under a Mexican flag. On July 30, 1864, Confederate troops reoccupied Brownsville and
held it until May 1865, a month after the surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee. Despite pleas from
Union commanders to end the conflict, the Confederates in the area refused to surrender, and on
May 13, 1865, they fought a skirmish with Union troops just outside of Brownsville, which became
known as the Battle of Palmito Ranch, the last battle of the Civil War. Although the Confederates
won the battle, they agreed to a truce a few days later. A hospital at Brazos Santiago served over
100,000 patients during the four years of the Civil War (Bates 2004; Garza and Long 2010a,
2010b; Hilbun and Koltermann 2002; Thompson 1997).
After the war, the U.S. Army reoccupied Brownsville and launched a massive reconstruction effort
at Fort Brown. By 1869, 70 new buildings stood at the fort, which housed army, infantry, and
cavalry units. The local economy, which had been fueled by the smuggling trade during the war,
was slow to recover. A major hurricane struck the area in 1867, destroying both Clarksville,
Texas, and Bagdad, Mexico, on either side of the mouth of the Rio Grande. Brazos Santiago was
submerged and Point Isabel was leveled by the storm. The economic recovery began with
construction of the narrow-gauge Rio Grande Railroad from Brownsville to Port Isabel in 1872. In
1875, Brownsville reestablished its public school system, and by 1884 the town had two banks,
three churches, two ice houses, a cotton gin, and a population of nearly 5,000. In the 1880s and
1890s, commercial fishing became big business in Point Isabel (Bates 2004; Garza and Long
2010a, 2010b).
The population of Cameron County during the early post-Civil War era was nearly equally split
between Anglos and Hispanics. Ethnic relations were generally harmonious and county leaders
consisted of both Anglos and Mexicans. During the 1880s and 1890s, however, tensions arose
when Anglos began taking over the large ranches of the county and displacing Mexican

ranchers—usually by purchase or marriage, but in some instances by fraud. Among the largest
landowners were the King and Kenedy families, who owned over 300,000 acres each in areas
later made part of Kenedy and Kleberg counties. By 1890 these large landowners controlled 97
percent of land in the county. Political power became concentrated in the hands of the emerging
Anglo elite. The Democratic Party became ensconced in the area through machine politics
(Garza and Long 2010a; Hilbun and Koltermann 2002; Thompson 1997).
3.2.5

Ranching and Farming in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries

The land on the western shore of Laguna Madre and the islands to the east historically were used
for cattle ranching. Spanish missionaries first brought cattle to south Texas to support the
missions around San Antonio in the eighteenth century. Under Spanish colonial rule in the 1760s,
large parcels bordering the Gulf or the Laguna Madre were given to influential citizens of the Rio
Grande towns of Camargo and Reynosa for the purpose of raising cattle and sheep. At least 35
of such grants were made in Texas, the largest of which was to José Narciso Cavazos and
consisted of 601,657 acres (243,487 ha). Some of these ranches were abandoned after 1836
when the border dispute between Texas and Mexico left the area at the mercy of smugglers,
bandits, cattle-rustlers, and other thieves (Hilbun and Koltermann 2002).
Later in the nineteenth century, Cameron County’s economy remained largely dependent on
ranching. Almost all the land in the county belonged to ranches, most of which were owned by a
few wealthy landowners. In addition to livestock, agricultural income for the county increasingly
derived from crops such as corn and a variety of vegetables for human consumption. Production
increased in the period just after the Civil War, but dropped off dramatically after 1880, in large
part due to the lack of rail access to outside markets. George Paul Brulay built the first successful
irrigation system in south Texas near Brownsville in 1876; but irrigated agricultural land
constituted only a fraction of the land under cultivation in the area. In the 1890s, the major
irrigated crop in the county was sugarcane. It was quickly eclipsed by citrus, vegetables, cotton,
and grain sorghum (Garza and Long 2010a; Williams et al. 1977:87).
Agriculture in the lower Rio Grande valley in the twentieth century was characterized by cycles of
economic boom and bust resulting from shifting markets, political upheaval, and periods of
unfavorable climatic conditions. When the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railroad was
completed to Brownsville in 1904, it set off a period of prosperity derived from the expanded
market access and lowered freight costs for area farmers. Branch lines followed. Many railroad
investors also purchased land in the valley and created private irrigation companies to unleash
the agricultural potential of this arid land. Soon, large numbers of farmers flooded into the area,
intending to plant cash crops such as sugar cane, corn, alfalfa, and cotton (Knight 2009:21–22,
38; Robertson 1985:119).
The land and irrigation companies purchased huge tracts of land, and secured water rights to the
Rio Grande under riparian and appropriation claims. In the years around 1910, investors and
potential settlers were brought in by train from the Midwest and other regions around the country
and treated to tours, banquets, and sales pitches. Various arrangements were developed
whereby the landowner paid a fee to the irrigation company, or purchased a stake in the company
to manage the complex operations. The irrigation systems were composed of a number of
components that included diversion, conveyance, distribution, and delivery features. Diversion
features such as dams and weirs routed water from the river to pumphouses that raised it into the
main canal. From there, lateral ditches and pipelines carried the water to the distribution points
that delivered water to the fields. Sometimes additional lift plants were needed to reach areas

that were well above the level of the river. The water from the pumphouses passed through
headworks that controlled the flow into the canals. Sometimes a settling basin was used to
remove the heavy sediment found in the Rio Grande (Garza and Long 2010a; Knight 2009:25–
28; Thompson 1997; Williams et al. 1977:87).
The disruption caused by the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s, a series of droughts and floods,
and an agricultural depression following World War I all contributed to failure for many of the
valley’s farmers. Many were unable to pay the fees necessary for the maintenance of the irrigation
systems. As a result, a number of systems were transferred to public ownership and organized
as irrigation districts under the Irrigation Act of 1913. This law gave local districts the right to issue
bonds for the purchase and improvement of irrigation systems, as well as the right of eminent
domain. Disastrous floods in 1919 and 1922 drew attention to another water control issue in the
valley: that of too much water. During flood events, the Rio Grande would alter its course,
impacting thousands of acres of farmland, sweeping away pumping stations and other irrigation
system infrastructure, and inundating farms, homes, even entire towns. Some of the irrigation
districts had constructed small levees as part of their systems, but a more ambitious, integrated
plan became a priority. Officials in Cameron and Hidalgo counties petitioned the state for the
right to issue bonds for the construction of a levee project. The plans were approved, bonds were
issued, and a levee was constructed from Brownsville to Donna in the late 1920s (Knight 2009:40–
42).
Improvements in transportation and refrigeration and the changes brought by the Irrigation Act
led to a second agricultural boom in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in the 1920s. In 1904, H.G.
Stillwell, Sr., planted the first commercial citrus orchard in the area, paving the way for what was
to become one of the leading industries in the region. Over time, citrus fruit trees became a
common sight, as farmers set aside acreage for trees and grew crops between the rows while
waiting for them to mature. Besides citrus, a variety of other fruits and vegetables were grown in
the valley, including asparagus, celery, peas, eggplant, tomatoes, and watermelon, earning the
region the nickname of “The Nation’s Truck Farm.” The long growing season allowed farmers to
ship vegetables earlier than other regions, and to produce two or more crops in a year (Garza
and Long 2010a; Knight 2009:56–57).
The valley experienced more severe floods in 1932 and 1933, pointing out deficiencies in the
levee system constructed by Cameron and Hidalgo counties in the 1920s. Effective control of the
river would depend on adequate improvements on both sides of the river. The International
Boundary Commission (IBC) (renamed the International Boundary and Water Commission in
1944) initiated talks with Mexico, and in 1933 the Public Works Administration (PWA) provided
emergency funds to the IBC to oversee a major flood control project. Plans were drawn up to
extend the levee westward to Peñitas, but construction was not completed until 1961. The IBC
made further improvements to the levee in the late 1960s (Cooper et al. 2002:60; Knight 2009:68).
The number of cultivated acres in the lower Rio Grande valley leveled off during the 1930s, as
did the amount of water diverted for irrigation purposes, but both categories saw a jump in the
1940s as area farmers sought to meet increased wartime demand for food. With increased
diversion of the Rio Grande’s water into irrigation systems, water shortages became a problem
during drought periods; conversely, a great deal of water was lost during high water because of
a lack of containment structures on the river. Interest in constructing a reservoir on the Rio
Grande grew. But construction was dependent on an agreement with Mexico. In 1944, the U.S.
and Mexico negotiated a treaty that was approved by Congress in 1945. Falcon Dam was not

completed for another decade, but the promise of an ample and dependable supply of water led
to another agricultural boom in the valley after World War II (Knight 2009:64–65, 73).
3.2.6

Modernization in the Twentieth Century

Not only did construction of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway in 1904 set off an
agricultural boom in the lower Rio Grande, it also prompted the emergence of a number of new
communities along that rail line and along subsequent lines that came into the county. Harlingen,
for example, was founded in 1904, when the rail line came through. Some small communities
that had existed around long-standing ranches grew into sizable communities if they were located
in proximity to the new railroad. Brownsville also grew significantly after the arrival of the railroad.
The trainloads of Midwestern farmers arriving in Cameron County also altered the demographics
of the area. Before 1900 nearly half of all those born in the lower Rio Grande had some Hispanic
ancestry, typically in the context of a family of mixed Anglo and Hispanic heritage. Both Anglo
and Mexican customs were widely practiced and respected, and ethnic identity was not imbued
with racial hostility. The county’s new residents, who were mostly Protestant and white, had
difficulty relating to the ethnically diverse culture of this border region, and were more reluctant to
assimilate. By the same token, Mexican citizens fleeing unrest at home during the Mexican
Revolution and seeking better economic opportunities came to Cameron County in significant
numbers in the early twentieth century. To support themselves, many were forced to accept
positions as poorly paid farm laborers, reinforcing stereotypes held by Anglo newcomers that
Hispanics belonged in an underclass. Cross border raids by bandits during the Mexican
Revolution further fueled hostility towards Hispanics.
The influx of both Anglos and Hispanics in the years from 1910 to 1930 translated into a boom in
the county’s population. The county had just over 16,000 residents in 1900, 27,158 in 1910, and
77,540 in 1930. By 1930 the population was almost equally divided between Anglos and
Hispanics. Over time, ethnic divisions began to widen, and conflicts became common. Racial
tensions did not confine themselves to Anglos and Mexicans. For example, the Brownsville Raid
of 1906 involved black troops stationed at Fort Brown who went on a rampage in the city and
killed or wounded a number of townspeople. African-Americans were, however, a tiny fraction of
the population. Because of the changing demographics of the county and the rising tide of racial
animosity between Anglos and Hispanics, the long-standing Democratic Party machine collapsed
in 1920. In its place, political power was seized by the new Anglo elite, made up mostly of recent
arrivals, who instituted a new social order in which de facto segregation became the rule.
Segregated facilities—including schools, churches, and restaurants—were established for
Hispanics and Anglos. Underfunded Hispanic schools generally provided inferior education
(Garza and Long 2010a, 2010b; Thompson 1997).
During Prohibition (1920–1933), Brownsville became an important port of entry for illegal liquor.
Brownsville also became popular with tourists interested in crossing the border to have a drink in
Matamoros, Mexico. The area also saw a steady growth in the volume of legal trade, facilitated
by the completion of a number of civic improvements, including paved roads, a new international
bridge, the first airport in the area, and completion of the port of Brownsville in 1936. The port of
Brownsville grew out of an initiative approved by voters in December 1928 to establish the
Brownsville Navigation District and fund construction of a ship channel with $2 million in bonds.
The ship channel would begin at Brazos Santiago Pass, and allow deepwater vessels to dock in
Brownsville. Construction was initially slow, but after a major hurricane hit the area in 1933, the
Public Works Administration lent money to the district to complete the 17-mile-long channel and
build a turning basin and terminal facilities. The port of Brownsville, located 5 miles northeast of

the city, was officially opened on May 15, 1936. With the port, Brownsville emerged as one of the
leading shipping points along the Texas coast. The port was originally 32 feet deep and 200 feet
wide, while the turning basin was 36 feet deep by 1,000 feet wide and handled five million tons of
cargo annually. Today the Brownsville Ship Channel has an authorized depth of 42 feet, and the
turning basin remains at a depth of 36 feet with a width of 1,200 feet. By 1980 the port had 48
piers, wharfs, and docks, with 17 facilities in the Brownsville Ship Channel, 17 in the fishing
harbor, and 14 on the Brownsville Turning Basin. The port was connected by rail to the Missouri
Pacific Railroad, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, and the National Railways of
Mexico. State Highway 48 runs alongside the ship channel. Dry and cold storage warehouses,
oil bunkering, bulk liquid storage, marine repair plans, dry-docking facilities, and a grain elevator
were also constructed at the port. The fishing harbor consists of three 14-foot-deep basins and
over 10,000 linear feet of docks, which can house up to 500 fishing boats that operate from the
Port of Brownsville (Bates 2004; Garza and Long 2010a, 2010b; Port of Brownsville, Texas 2012).
The completion of the port made Brownsville the shipping center for the lower Rio Grande valley
as well as northeastern Mexico, and the massive construction effort helped the city weather the
worst effects of the Great Depression. Unlike other areas in Texas and the country as a whole,
the Rio Grande Valley saw growth in both population and in the number of active farms during
the Great Depression. Cameron County had 1,507 farms in 1920; that number nearly doubled
by 1930 to 2,936, and by 1940, there were 3,243 farms in the county. Likewise, the total number
of acres under cultivation rose, from 83,121 in 1920 to 101,376 in 1930, and 120,064 in 1940.
Although the Great Depression slowed the rate of growth, the region’s economy benefitted from
the success of commercial-scale, irrigated truck farming—focusing on carrots, lettuce, onions,
strawberries, melons, and other such produce—and the growth of cotton as a cash crop (Garza
and Long 2010a, 2010b; Thompson 1997).
The Second World War also sparked the regional economy. The new port became an important
shipping center during World War II, and local farmers increased food production to help meet
the country’s needs. During the war, there was U-boat activity in the Gulf off Port Isabel, but it
did not stop the shipping traffic to and from the port. In Brownsville, Fort Brown served as training
base for the 124th Cavalry, and large numbers of servicemen passed through the town. The fort
was deactivated in 1945, and the grounds were eventually turned over to the city. Also during
the war, Pan American Airways relinquished management of the Brownsville municipal airport as
a national defense measure, and the U.S. government leased 884 acres for use by the Army Air
Force. The air field was the site of test flights for the first jet engine and renovation of the B-29
bomber. The airport had one of the largest overhaul facilities in the country; by the end of the
war, Pan American had overhauled nearly 6,000 engines. The air field was also involved in a
civilian pilot training program initiated to train both military and commercial pilots. The only
Mexican military unit to serve in combat during World War II, the 201st Fighter Squadron (known
as the Aztec Eagles), and the only foreign air force ever stationed on U.S. soil, was trained at the
Brownsville Army Air Field. After the war, the U.S. Border Patrol began processing
undocumented immigrants at the airport. Given the economic activity directly or indirectly tied to
the war effort, Cameron County’s population increased rapidly in the 1940s to 129,170 by 1950
(Bates 2004; Brownsville South Padre Island International Airport n.d.; Garza and Long 2010a,
2010b).
After the war, Brownsville experienced continued growth. Shrimpers from Texas and Louisiana
moved into the area and established the town as one of the leading shippers of shrimp in the
country. The number of farms in Cameron County began to decline after 1950 as the result of
consolidations, and the need for farm labor declined with new labor-saving technologies, but farm

output grew dramatically during this period. For example, in 1949 Cameron County farmers grew
214,536 bales of cotton, making the area one of the leading cotton-producing regions in the state.
Production of other crops such as grapefruit, oranges, and sugarcane also increased significantly.
As a result, the port of Brownsville also saw a growing volume of agricultural produce. For a time
in the 1950s, the port of Brownsville was the world’s leading exporter of cotton. In 1949, the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway was extended to Brownsville and the ship channel was expanded to
accommodate larger vessels. Union Carbide began construction of a plant near Brownsville in
1959, launching a new era of major industrial operations in the area. The discovery of oil in 1944
provided another development that would be an important part of the local economy through the
remainder of the twentieth century (Garza and Long 2010a, 2010b).
In 1966, the Industrial Development Council was formed to encourage new industries to locate in
the area, and the following year the Border Industrialization Program was instituted by the
Mexican government to attract Mexican businesses and laborers to the border region. Through
aggressive recruitment, the Brownsville area attracted more than 100 industrial firms that offered
13,600 jobs between 1966 and 1978. By the1990s, a diverse array of major industries were
located in the Brownsville area, with products ranging from petrochemicals, metal products, and
mill work, to mattresses, garments, frozen foods, canned fruits and vegetables, and beverages.
With the influx of industry, Brownsville grew rapidly from the 1970s through the mid-1990s. Much
of the population growth came from immigration from Mexico, but the area also has received a
growing number of retirees from the North and Midwest. For Cameron County overall, the
population in 1980 was 209,727; it rose to 260,120 in 1990, 82 percent of whom were of Hispanic
descent. The civil-rights movement of the 1960s helped to desegregate the county, and a growing
number of Mexican Americans subsequently attained positions of power (Garza and Long 2010a,
2010b).
Desegregation did not solve all of Cameron County’s problems regarding racial justice, and
integration of low-income Mexican immigrants into the community has presented challenges. In
the 1960s, changes in the cotton market drove down land values in the region, and prompted
many farmers to sell all or portions of their farms to developers. Capitalizing on the flow of
immigrants into Brownsville and other border towns, developers platted new subdivisions near
cities and in some rural areas, and sold small plots at cheap prices to low-income families. Known
as colonias, these settlements were typically located outside of city limits where no public services
were provided. Many of the houses were little more than shanties constructed by hand of scrap
material, and residents obtained water from tainted wells or brought water in from incorporated
areas, often in contaminated containers. Many colonias were built on flood plains, and were
transformed into mosquito-infested open sewers after every heavy rain. Living conditions were
squalid. By the 1980s, activists began urging officials to act regarding the high rates of disease
in colonias. Some legislation was passed to regulate colonias in Texas’ border towns, but as of
1995, there were still 118 colonias in Cameron County, housing 41,832 residents. One of those,
Cameron Park, was the poorest place in the United States according to the 2000 census. In
1999, Texas authorized an initiative to coordinate state efforts to improve transportation, housing,
health conditions, and water quality for colonias. Hundreds of millions of state dollars have been
allocated for the work. In December 2010, a report laid out details of modest progress to date for
the six counties along the border. It found that in 2006, about 63,000 people lived in “red”
colonias, a designation for those with no drinkable water or drainage, compared with 145,000 in
“green” colonias where basic infrastructure, including sewerage and paved roads exists. In 2010,
45,000 people lived in the red colonias and 194,000 in green. Nevertheless, the standard of living

for farm laborers and other low income immigrants living in colonias remains very low (García
2010b; Perkins et al. 2001:50–53; The Economist 2011).
The population of Cameron County had grown to 406,220 in 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau 2015).
It is one of the fastest growing counties in the nation. Most of that growth derives from the strong
employment picture, the county’s border location, and welcoming attitude towards immigrants.
The economy provides a mix of service sector and manufacturing jobs, and agriculture remains
important in the region (Brownsville Chamber of Commerce 2014). By the 1990s, Cameron
County was among the state’s largest producers of cotton and sorghum. Other leading crops
included corn, sugarcane, hay, soybeans, onions, cabbage, cantaloupes, bell peppers,
watermelons, cucumbers, carrots, honeydew melons, tomatoes, grapefruit, oranges, and pecans.
Cattle and hogs were also raised in significant numbers. A significant amount of the county’s
nonfarm income came from processing fruits and vegetables, as well as from fishing and seafood
processing. Oil and natural gas have also been important players in the local economy (Garza
and Long 2010a). Recently SpaceX has made plans to build a private space launch facility on
the Gulf coast east of Brownsville, which will likely stimulate additional growth in the county (Nield
2014).

4.0 METHODS
4.1

LITERATURE AND RECORDS SEARCH

Prior to beginning fieldwork, a literature and records search was conducted at the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL); the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas Database was also consulted. The purpose was to identify the location
of all previously recorded archaeological sites or historic resources that could be affected by the
project, gather information on those resources, and review their eligibility status for the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Another objective was to obtain a perspective on the types
of cultural resources that would likely be encountered during field work by reviewing the results
of previous cultural resource investigations that have been conducted in the project vicinity. The
results of the review are presented in Chapter 5.0.
4.2

ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODS

One of the goals of the field investigations was to conduct a general Phase I cultural resources
survey of the project tract. Another objective was to gather information at 41CF8, a NRHP-listed
site, to supplement existing data that had been obtained in the past during reconnaissance-level
studies. The supplemental data was needed to develop a mitigation strategy and data recovery
plan, if that is eventually deemed necessary. The methods for investigating 41CF8 were
developed after consulting with, and getting formal approval from, the THC (response dated
January 28, 2015).
4.2.1

Phase I Survey

Standard methods were used during the Phase I survey that meet or exceed all federal and state
requirements, including those outlined in Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. All shovel
tests were 30 cm or 50 cm in diameter, and excavated to the bottom of the Holocene deposits, or
a maximum of 110 cm below surface. They were placed at 30 m intervals along transects spaced
30 m apart. Soils were screened through ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth. Because the vast majority
of the survey area is either designated wetland, or exhibited hydric conditions at the time of our
survey (see Figure 2.0-3), systematic shovel testing was limited to one area containing a small
dune remnant that encompasses approximately 10 acres.
Hand-held Global Positioning System units were used to record shovel test locations and obtain
all other relevant provenience information. General field conditions were photographed and
documented with digital media.
4.2.2

Supplemental Investigations at 41CF8

The largest portion of 41CF8 was reported to be spread across the entirety of Loma del Mesquite,
which harbored impenetrable vegetation when we began the supplemental field investigations
(see Figure 2.0-2). Therefore, our efforts began by mechanically removing the vegetation at
ground level along a 3-m-wide transect that was oriented along the spine of the loma (Figures
4.2.2-1 and 4.2.2-2). Once that was completed, vegetation was also removed from a series of
lateral transects oriented perpendicular to the spine that were established at 50-m intervals.
Shovel tests were conducted at 25 m intervals along the spine, and at 50 m intervals along the
laterals (Figure 4.2.2-3).

Figure 4.2.2-1 View of Vegetation Removal Operations.
The shovel tests were 50 cm in diameter and excavated to a maximum depth of 120 cm below
surface. A 3.5-inch hand-turned bucket auger was placed at the base of selected shovel tests,
and used to extend the depth of excavations to a maximum of 200 cm. All soil was screened
through ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth.
There were two places on Loma del Mesquite where ranchers had excavated large depressions
that were used to retain water for a cattle (Figure 4.2.2-4). Small segments of exposed banks
within those depressions were cleaned and profiled in order to examine the natural stratigraphy
and determine if cultural deposits were present (Figure 4.2.2-5).
Eight 1 x 1-m test units were excavated in selected areas once the shovel testing and profiling
phase was complete. They were dug in 10-cm levels by hand to a maximum depth of 110 cm
below the surface. All of the test unit soil was screened through ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth.
Unit level forms were completed for the excavated test units. The forms include a description of
the strata and recovered artifacts, elevations, and a list of all artifact bags removed from the unit.
Soil profiles for each test unit were drawn and photographed. The soils were described according
to the Munsell color system and the USDA soil texture designations.

Artifacts recovered from each unique provenience were placed in plastic bags that were labeled
and returned to the laboratory for analysis. Test units were backfilled when excavation was
completed. Note that scattered pieces of land snail and marine shell and apparently modern
animal bone were observed across the Project area. When they were not associated with any
kind of midden concentration, artifacts, or features and could not be confidentially associated with
human activity, they were not collected. In such instances, they were considered to be natural
occurrences rather than accumulations created by humans.
Hand-held Global Positioning System units were used to record shovel test locations, test unit
locations, and all other relevant provenience information. General field conditions were
photographed and documented with digital media.

LABORATORY METHODS AND CURATION

All artifacts were returned to the NRG archaeological laboratory in Atlanta for analysis and
temporary curation. The first step in the analysis involved inventory control measures such as
updating bag lists, correlating level forms with the bag lists, and cross-checking artifact and
feature proveniences.
The artifacts were then examined and sorted into categories. Artifact analysis forms
corresponding to specific proveniences and bag numbers reflect the provenience, bag number,
quantity, artifact raw material in the case of lithic artifacts, surface treatment, temper and vessel
portion for ceramic sherds, and, in some cases, the total weight of each artifact type, as well as
artifact descriptions and classifications. The analysis was geared to focus on identifying
temporally diagnostic items to refine the occupational history of the sites, by using established
lithic and ceramic types known in the region. The analysis also sought to determine the function
or range of functions carried out at the site through time. Unfortunately, those objectives were
not met because none of the artifacts could be assigned to a specific date range or cultural
component.
4.3.1

Prehistoric Artifact Analysis
4.3.1.1

Lithic Analysis

The prehistoric artifact analysis focused on identifying assemblages and/or technological
attributes diagnostic of particular temporal and geographical cultural trends. The artifacts were
identified according to established regional types or styles. The following categories were used
in the lithic analysis.
Biface Thinning Flakes. Biface thinning flakes are relatively thin and flat to slightly curved in
cross section. Secondary flake scars are frequently present on the dorsal surface. The
platform may be faceted and may exhibit a distinct lip, and the bulb of percussion is usually
diffuse. These features are characteristic of soft-hammer percussion, and flakes of this type
are most often the result of late stage biface reduction and maintenance.
Blades and Bladelike Flakes. These flakes approach or exceed a length-to-width ratio of 2:1.
Blades and bladelike flakes frequently have a ridge along the dorsal surface. They are typically
manufactured for a specific purpose, such as replacing edges in cutting or grating implements.
Bipolar Flakes. Bipolar flakes exhibit a bulb of percussion on the ventral surface of both the
distal and proximal ends. They are often curved in cross section. These flakes are manufactured
by placing the raw material on a hard surface, such as an anvil stone, and striking its superior
surface with a hard implement.
Unspecialized Flakes. These flakes are relatively thick and wide, with little or no indication of a
particular function or stage of manufacture.
Flake Fragments. This category includes those flakes that have only nondiagnostic medial or
distal portions. Any flake lacking a proximal end was placed in this category.

Shatter. Shatter is debitage that is angular and blocky. Specimens in this category cannot
be oriented in relation to their proximal or distal end.
The second major lithic group is functional artifacts. The categories in this group are defined as
follows:
Hafted Bifaces. Hafted bifaces are bifacially worked artifacts that have a hafting element (i.e.,
stem and notches). They are often described as projectile points or knives and may conform
to established type names.
Preforms. Tools in this category are unfinished hafted bifaces. They exhibit rudimentary hafting
elements and lateral blade margins.
Bifaces. This category consists of artifacts that are bifacially worked and do not have haft
elements.
Formal Unifacial Tools. These are tools that have been unifacially worked into specific forms
that repeatedly occur in lithic assemblages. Examples include end scrapers, side scrapers,
and perforators.
Retouched, Used, or Modified (RUM) Flakes. The category of RUM flakes includes all flakes
that have been retouched into an informal unifacial tool, exhibit use-wear, or have been modified
by undetermined means.
Cobble Tools. Cobble tools are altered or unaltered cobbles used as hammerstones,
nutting stones, anvils, and other similar tools.
Cores. Cores are remnants of stone tool manufacture. They are usually blocky or discoidal rocks
that exhibit flake scars on at least on face.
Manuports. Manuports are unaltered pieces of stone that are not indigenous to the area
and obviously have been transported to the site by humans.
Fire-Cracked Rock. Although fire-cracked rock is not a tool per se, these are rocks that exhibit
evidence of having been in or near a fire, often associated with human activity. Alteration in
color and/or luster, angular fractures, and potlidded surfaces are diagnostic of fire-cracked rock.
4.3.1.2

Prehistoric Faunal Artifact Analysis

All shell and bone artifacts were inspected for the presence of wear, perforations, engraving,
or other non-subsistence related modifications that could be attributed to human behavior.
4.3.1.3

Prehistoric Ceramic Analysis

The prehistoric ceramic assemblage is limited to four small prehistoric vessel fragments that
cannot be assigned to a specific cultural component because they are too fragmentary. The
analysis was limited to identifying surface condition, paste, and temper.

Unmodified Prehistoric Artifacts

This category includes unmodified1 shell, bone, and naturally occurring petroleum-based debris
(asphaltum) that, according to their provenience, were presumably brought to the site by the
prehistoric and/or early historic period inhabitants. These items were separated into their
respective categories and subcategories, counted, and weighed. The categories are general
in nature, and no attempt was made to identify the faunal remains at the genus and species
level.
4.3.2

Historic Artifact Analysis

Seven pieces of bottle glass that originate from the surface are the only historic artifacts that
were recovered. They were categorized by color, but they do not retain attributes that can be
used to assign dates of manufacture. A brass spike was recovered as well, but its specific
origin or use could not be determined.
4.4

HISTORIC STRUCTURE FIELD METHODS

An APE is defined as “the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may directly or
indirectly cause changes in the character or use of historic properties, if any such properties exist”
(36 CFR Part 800.16[d]).
Field methods for the historic structures survey involved driving all of the roadways surrounding
the project area. All previously unrecorded structures that appeared to be 50 years old or older
and visually connected to the proposed Project were to be photographed and marked on the
applicable U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle map. Structures that were highly deteriorated were
to be excluded, as were structures whose original form had been modified beyond recognition.
Survey photographs were to be taken to record the structures’ overall appearance and details.
Sketch maps of the properties’ area and associations also were to be made. Additional
information on the structures’ appearance and integrity was to be recorded to assist in making
recommendations of NRHP eligibility. However, no previously unrecorded historic resources
were identified within the APE.
4.5

CURATION OF PROJECT MATERIALS

The artifacts, field notes, maps, photographs, and other technical materials generated as a
result of this project will be temporarily curated at the NRG corporate office in Atlanta. They
will be shipped to the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory for permanent curation
upon completion of the project and upon receipt of landowner permission.

5.0 RESULTS
The results of the Phase I cultural resources survey and subsequent supplemental investigations
at 41CF8 are provided below. The project area is confined to the 625-acre tract where Texas
LNG plans to build and operate a liquefied natural gas export facility (see Figure 1.1-1).
The Phase I survey encompassed the 490 acres that were not part of the supplemental study of
41CF8. The vast majority of that acreage is either designated wetland, or exhibited hydric
conditions at the time of our survey (see Figure 2.0-3). Those places were subjected to pedestrian
survey in places that were not saturated or inundated. There is only one area, a small dune
remnant that encompasses approximately 10 acres, that was subjected to systematic shovel
testing.
The supplemental investigations at 41CF8 focused on the remaining 135 acres. It included the
densely vegetated Loma del Mesquite (Areas 1, 3, and 4) and two loci (Areas 2 and 5) that are
detached from the loma, but were previously defined as part of 41CF8. Areas 1, 3, and 4
encompass approximately 120 acres, and Areas 2 and 5 are 10.5 and 4.5 acres respectively (see
Figures 1.1-1 and 4.2.2-3).
5.1

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

In addition to 41CF8, there are six previously recorded archaeological sites within one mile of the
study tract (Table 5.1-1). None of them are located in the current project area (see Figure 1.1-1).
A number of cultural resources surveys conducted for channel/navigation projects were
conducted in the vicinity of the Project during the 1980s, including Espey Huston & Associates
(1981), Trahan (1985), and Celmer (1986). The Texas Department of Transportation also
conducted an archaeological survey for rights-of-way along State Highway 48 (Weinstein et al.
2005). The only prior archaeological investigations that took place within the Project tract were
surface reconnaissance surveys that were conducted in the early twentieth century by A.E.
Anderson and again in 1970 by Prewitt (1974) (see below).

auspices of the State Archeologist’s office. The 1970 investigations were part of a broader survey
that encompassed a large area within the Rio Grande Delta region and documented 79 sites.
Specific investigations at 41CF8 remain largely unpublished from this effort. A summary of the
overall survey from 1970 was presented in a 1971 paper at the Conference on the Archaeology
of the Gulf Coast and subsequently published in the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society
(Prewitt 1974). In 1972, the site was listed in the NRHP, and much of the basic information
currently available comes from the NRHP Inventory–Nomination Form that was used for the
nomination and listing.
The 1970 investigations were limited to a generalized inspection of exposed surfaces and
erosional gullies. Artifacts noted from the site include small projectile points (including reports of
one or more made from glass and brass), pottery, marine shell ornaments (including beads and
tools), bone, and lithic debris. The presence of a large quantity of oyster shell—which was lacking
entirely at many sites in the area—was cited as evidence that the site may represent a specialized
shell disc manufacturing area (Prewitt 1974:60). Prewitt noted in his summary that a collector
stated that a burial was found at the site, reportedly a flexed interment that contained grave goods
(Prewitt 1974:61).
The Anderson collection, which is currently curated at TARL, was examined by NRG in March
2015. It included many examples from the artifact categories mentioned above. Although a
considerable amount that material has an origin that is generally attributed to Cameron County,
none of the items could be specifically associated with 41CF8.
No other cultural resource investigations have been carried out in the Project’s APE, and no other
cultural resources have been reported.

PHASE I SURVEY

5.2.1

Archaeology

A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated on a remnant dune that is located on the southern
portion of the study tract (see Figure 4.2.2-3). As mentioned previously, this is the only place
within the Phase I study area where shovel testing was deemed appropriate.
The soil in this portion of the project tract is classified as Point Isabel clay loam, which forms under
eolian conditions, and is commonly found on vegetated dunes (see Table 2.3-1). A typical pedon
exhibits dark grayish brown A1 and A2 horizons that are a combined 30 cm thick. It is underlain
by several light brownish gray, gray, and light gray Bkn horizons that extend to approximately
200 cm below the surface (USDA, NRCS 2015). In most places, shovel tests yielded similar
results, and indicate soil development is relatively stable. In some areas, however, the soil column
consists of multiple shallow bands indicative of intermittent periods of deposition and erosion.
Typical shovel test soil profiles depicting both sets of conditions are provided in Figure 5.2.1-1.
No cultural material was encountered in the shovel tests, no artifacts were observed on the
surface, and no above-ground features were observed during the Phase I survey.

SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AT 41CF8

Since no subsurface archaeological investigations have been reported for 41CF8, supplemental
investigations were designed to meet three primary goals:
1. Determine how artifacts are distributed within the various areas that comprise
41CF8. The boundary of the main site area and associated loci appear to have been
drawn based on the configuration of the landforms, but it was unclear if cultural
material was present throughout those areas.
2. Identify specific cultural components and define the temporal occupation(s). Work by
Prewitt (1974), and collections by Anderson (1932), indicate 41CF8 was occupied

during the late prehistoric and contact periods. There were suggestions that
stratified deposits are present, but there was no solid data to support this assertion.
3. Document stratigraphic relationships across the site in order to guide future
excavations that could be carried out to mitigate the adverse effects of the proposed
undertaking, in the event that would be necessary. An adequate sample of the site
area needed to be examined so that a mitigation plan could target key areas, and be
designed to gather the appropriate types of information from those locations.
Our attempt to meet those objectives was accomplished through a comprehensive shovel testing
program that was augmented with 1 x 1-m test unit investigations. A detailed description of our
approach and methodology is provided in Section 4.2.

Surface Collection

Nineteen artifacts were collected from the surface (Table 5.3.1.1-1). All of the items originate
from the shoreline or other disturbed contexts. In terms of the prehistoric assemblage, six
perforated shell fragments represent three complete specimens and are comparable to others
that have been collected from similar contexts throughout Cameron County (Figure 5.3.1.1-1).
The only prehistoric ceramic artifact is a very small sand-tempered sherd with no surface
decoration. It is too fragmentary to be assigned to a specific age or cultural affiliation. The historic
artifact inventory is limited to a few examples of bottle glass, container glass, and a brass spike;
all of those items have unknown dates of manufacture.

Shovel Tests

A total of 140 shovel tests were conducted on Loma del Mesquite (see Figure 4.2.2-3). Only two
of those excavations yielded material that was modified or deliberately created by humans.
Shovel Test T4 ST 11.5 contained a perforated Olive shell bead that has broken into two pieces,
and Shovel Test T4 L9W ST2 yielded a very small bone-tempered body sherd that is not
decorated (Figure 5.3.1.2-1). The perforated shell was recovered from a shovel test in Area 3; it
originates from a buried A horizon that occurs 15–30 cm below the surface. No other artifacts,
including faunal remains, were encountered. The sherd was discovered in a shovel test in Area
1. It occurred in the upper 20 cm of the soil column within a surficial A horizon, and was not
associated with bone, shell, or other artifacts. Although the sherd could be part of a Rockport
vessel, that attribution cannot be made with confidence, and neither artifact can be assigned to a
specific cultural component.
One shovel test (TR4 L8W ST1) contained 22 unmodified mammal bone fragments (a total of 8.9
g) that could possibly be associated with a feature. They were encountered within a dark band
that occurs 60–85 cm below the surface, but there was no evidence of burning, and no lithic,
ceramic, or shell artifacts were associated with the bone concentration. Shovel Test T4 L9W ST4
yielded 3.1 g of unmodified bone fragments from the upper 25 cm of the soil column. However,

they were not associated with any soil anomalies or other artifacts. Small quantities of shell and
fragmented mammal bone were encountered in a few other shovel tests, but the concentrations
were very light, and it is unknown if those specimens are natural occurrences, or associated with
human activity.
5.3.1.3

Test Units

Five 1 x 1-m test units were excavated on Loma del Mesquite (see Figure 4.2.2-3). Other than
incidental discoveries of isolated pieces of bone or shell in the shovel tests conducted in Areas 3
and 4, there was no evidence that concentrated human activity occurred in that portion of the
loma. Therefore, test unit excavations were limited to Area 1, where unmodified bone and shell
fragments were occasionally observed on the surface. Isolated pockets of bone and shell were
also found in the walls of the cattle ponds in the northern portion of Loma del Mesquite that were
profiled prior to beginning test unit excavations, but they were not associated with any artifacts of
direct human manufacture (see Section 4.2.2; Figure 4.2.2-5).
Profiles of all five test units are provided in Figures 5.3.1.3-1–5.3.1.3-5. Test Unit 1 was placed
2 m southeast of Shovel Test TR4 L8W ST1, where the bone concentration and possible feature
was encountered (see above). Test Unit 4 was located near shovel tests T4 L9W ST2 and
T4 L9W ST4, where the sherd and other bone was found. Since there was very little material
culture from shovel tests to guide the placement of test units, the three remaining units were
placed in areas where the microtopography was deemed to be most suitable for human habitation.

Figure 5.3.1.3-5 Test Unit 5 Profiles
None of the five test units contained intentionally manufactured artifacts. Faunal remains that
appear to be associated with subsistence were encountered in Test Units 2 and 3, but there were
only incidental occurrences of bone and shell in Test Units 1, 4, and 5 (Table 5.3.1.3-1). Test
Unit 2 also contained many small pieces of asphaltum, a naturally occurring petroleum substance
that occurs on the beaches and in the tidal zone of the Gulf of Mexico. It was used to coat basketry
and decorate pottery, among other things.
The faunal material recovered from Test Unit 2 occurred within Strata II, IV, VI, and VIII (Figure
5.3.1.3-6). All four of those horizons consist of a dark silt loam that appears to have a higher
organic content than the intervening strata (see Figure 5.3.1.3-2; Figure 5.3.1.3-7). All of the bone
and shell recovered from Test Unit 3 originates from Stratum I, within the only dark soil horizon
that was encountered in that excavation (see Figure 5.3.1.3-2). Dark strata, which are
presumably high in organic content, were also encountered in Test Units 1, 4, and 5 (see Figures
5.3.1.3-1, 5.3.1.3-4, and 5.3.1.3-5). However, only very minor amounts of faunal material were
found in those excavations, and the specimens were isolated individual fragments that appear to
be incidental additions to the general soil matrix.

Area 5

Area 5 occurs in the east-central portion of the project tract, and was included as part of 41CF8
on the NRHP Inventory–Nomination Form that was used for the nomination and listing (see
Figures 1.1-1 and 4.2.2-3). It is a small dune remnant that had limited surface visibility at the time
of our investigation.
5.3.2.1

Shovel Tests

Twelve shovel tests were excavated within Area 5 (see Figure 4.2.2-3). Three unmodified bone
fragments were recovered from shovel test T2 ST2; they originate from a dark soil horizon that
was encountered 15–30 cm below surface. All of the remaining shovel tests yielded negative
results.
5.3.2.2

Test Units

Three 1 x 1-m test units were placed in the vicinity of shovel test T2 ST2 (see Figure 4.2.2-3).
Profiles of all five test units are provided in Figures 5.3.2.2-1–5.3.2.2-3.
One very small chert biface, one piece of chert debitage, and 11 pieces of daub were recovered
from the base of Stratum II and the upper portion of Stratum III in Test Unit 6 (Table 5.3.2.2-1).
They originate from levels associated with a concentration of bone and shell that occurs above
and within a dark, and presumably organically rich, band of silt loam (see Figures 5.3.2.2-1;
Figures 5.3.2.2-4 and 5.3.2.2-5). Asphaltum was found throughout the soil column, but the
highest concentrations occurred at the Stratum II/III interface and in Stratum III.
The assemblage from Test Unit 7 is limited to a relatively small amount of unmodified bone and
shell fragments that were encountered in Stratum IV. However, most of that material occurred at
the base of the stratum, within animal burrows that originate at the surface and extend downward
along the east and west walls of the test unit (see Figure 5.2.2.2-2). Although a few isolated
pieces of incidental shell and bone were found in Test Unit 8, that excavation did not yield any
material that could confidently be associated with human activity. Finally, the dark soil horizons
observed in Test Unit 6, and in some of the test units on Loma del Mesquite (see Section 5.3.1.1),
were not encountered in Test Units 7 and 8.

Area 2

Area 2 is a dune remnant that was included as part of 41CF8 on the NRHP Inventory–Nomination
Form that was used for the nomination and listing; it occurs in the northwestern portion of the
project tract (see Figures 1.1-1 and 4.2.2-3). Surface visibility ranged from 25–50 percent at the
time of our investigation.
No artifacts were observed on the surface, and none of the 10 shovel tests placed within Area 2
contained cultural material. Other than incidental natural occurrences of apparently modern shell
and bone not associated with archaeological remains, faunal materials were absent as well. The
soil is classified as Port Isabel clay loam, the profiles were similar throughout Area 2, and are
consistent with expectations based on the description for that series (see Section 5.2.1).
5.4

DISCUSSION

No archaeological sites or historic structures were identified during the Phase I survey in areas
that are not associated with 41CF8. Although 41CF8 is listed on the NRHP, supplemental
investigations failed to confirm that the prehistoric, and possibly early historic, occupations were
as extensive and intensive as previously reported.
We can only speculate as to why that is the case. The earlier studies were conducted in the early
and mid-twentieth century, when more surface area was likely exposed. Those investigations
were limited to random surface inspection, and artifacts were primarily recovered from ditches
and gullies created by runoff. Because the site area was not systematically investigated, it may
have been assumed that archaeological remains were present in a continuous fashion across a
broader area.
Although the spatial extent of the cultural deposits is much more limited than we anticipated, there
are some places within 41CF8 that are of archaeological interest. Despite finding only two
deliberately manufactured artifacts in subsurface contexts, there are places within Area 1 on
Loma del Mesquite that contain stratified bone and shell deposits associated with soil horizons
(possibly anthrosols) that appear to be high in organic content. The same situation, although
more confined, is evident in the northern portion of Area 5.
The test unit data indicate that subsistence related activities, very likely representing habitation
zones, occur within Areas 1 and 5. It is also possible that others occur elsewhere on Loma del
Mesquite but have gone undetected. More extensive excavations in Areas 1 and 5 would likely
expose hearths, storage pits, refuse pits, post patterns, and other features that have significant
research value. Since faunal remains are very well preserved, that would present a good
opportunity to study food acquisition and dietary practices of the region’s prehistoric and early
historic inhabitants. The site also offers the potential to learn much more about the manufacture
and use of organic tools. Finally, if properly designed and executed, additional archaeological
investigations at 41CF8 would be important in more general terms, because very few sites have
been professionally excavated in this portion of the country.

6.0 CONCLUSION
In January and February 2015, NRG conducted cultural resource investigations associated with
the proposed Texas LNG Project in Cameron County, Texas. The studies included Phase I
archaeological and historic structures surveys on 490 acres, and supplemental testing within five
areas that encompass the remaining 135 acres (see Figure 1.1-1). Most of that acreage occurs
within three loci (Areas 1, 3, and 4) on a clay dune known as Loma del Mesquite; the two
remaining loci (Areas 2 and 5) occur in the northwestern and east-central portion of the project
tract, respectively. Although they are not contiguous to the loma, those areas were defined as
part of previously recorded site 41CF8, which is listed on the NRHP.
The goal of the Phase I surveys was to assist the FERC in meeting the requirements of Section
106 of the NHPA. In addition to the survey of the Project’s APE, a series of shovel tests and 1 x
1-m excavations were conducted within the five loci that are associated with 41CF8. The objective
was to gather additional information so that a data recovery plan could be designed and
implemented, if that was deemed necessary.
No previously recorded historic structures occur within the APE, and 41CF8 is the only previously
recorded archaeological resource within the 625-acre tract. No new archaeological sites or
historic structures were identified within the APE during the Phase I survey, which did not include
the areas that comprise 41CF8, the 25-acre parcel on Loma de la Draga, or the mudflats.
Results obtained during supplemental investigations at 41CF8 indicate that the spatial extent of
the cultural deposits is much more limited than was anticipated. The age and nature of the
occupation(s) also remains unresolved. However, there are two places within Areas 1 and 5 that
contain intact, stratified cultural deposits. Those areas have significant research potential and, in
our estimation, they are contributing elements to the overall significance of 41CF8. The project
will have an adverse effect on those elements. Therefore, we recommend that data recovery
investigations be completed within Areas 1 and 5 before any ground disturbing activities are
initiated. That effort should focus on the places within those loci where stratified bone and shell
deposits are associated with soils that appear to have elevated amounts of other organic material.
Those places of interest total approximately 10 acres. We also recommend that Areas 2, 3, and
4 be considered as non-contributing elements, and that no additional work be required at those
locations.
In our opinion, there will be no effect to cultural resources within the 490 acres associated with
Phase I investigations. Therefore, no additional work should be required in those areas before
construction begins.

Original Site

------- - - ' - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ------!
The Garcia P~sture Site (41 CF 8) , an extensive prehistoric
Indian site, covers most of Loma del Mesquite, a typical coastal
clay dune in the landward flats facing Laguna Madre. The lama
(hill) rises fifteen to twenty-f ive feet above sea level and
forms a large backward "L". The long arm of the "L" is oriented
almost north-south; the short arm is oriented east-west.
Includ=d
as part of the site are two areas near Loma del Mesquite. One
is a low finger of the lama that runs northeastward from the
bend of the 11 L"; the area is covered with a good growth of grass
and also has some cactus and a little brush. The second area,
a small rise about two thousand feet northeast of the lama, is
covered with dense brush and cactus that is almost inpenetrable.
Numerous small erosional gullies dissect the slopes of the lama,
and occupational debris is exposed as deep as two feet in the
m
walls of them.

The Garcia Pasture Site (41 CF 8) is the largest and only
stratified prehistoric Indian site now recorded in Cameron
County. Cultural debris is eroding from the surface of the
site over an area of several acres and stratified cultural
deposits up to several feet in depth are exposed. The geo graphical location of Garcia Pasture near Brazos Santiago Pass,
its position overlooking Laguna Madre, and its size and apparen
depth make it one of the most significant sites in the area.
Work in Cameron County has been restricted, for the most
part, to the efforts of A. E. Anderson (1917 -1935 ) whose collec
tion from sites in the area including Garcia Pasture are now
housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Balcones
Research Center , The University of Texas, and are being studied
More recently (1970), a preliminary archeological survey of the
area was conducted by the State Archeologist's office, the Texa
State Historical Survey Committee (Tunnell, ms. in preparation )
An inventory of the artifacts collected from the surface at
G?rcia Pasture includes arrow points, pottery, and shell ornaments. One human burial has been reported by local collectors.
Although archeologists generally agree that this area
· played a major role in the prehistory of South Texas and north eastern Mexico, and that its influence was felt as far away as
Casas Grandes in Chihuahua, Mexico, little is known of the
archeology about the mouth of the Rio Grande . R. S. McNeish
(1958) has done work in adjacent Tamaulipas, Mexico, but the
efforts on this side of the river are restricted to the collec tions of A. E. P..nderson and the 1970 preliminary survey of the
Texas State Historical Survey Committe e.
McNeish (1958) has estimated the age of the Garcia Pasture
Site (along with the rest of what he termed the Brownsville
Complex) at about 1500 A.D. to 1700 A.D. However, there are
certain features of the site that were noted in the 1970 survey
which were not revealeo'. to McNeish. Based on these more recent
observations, there is material that belongs to the Barril
Complex as well, and could push the estimated age of the site

(contd.)

as far back a 1000 A.D. Glass arrow points have been found on
the site and substantiate McNeish's guess that the site was
occupied until well after European contact . Thus, this site has
three archeological time and/or cultural uni ts represented: the
Barril Complex, the Brownsville Complex, and the Historic Phase.
This, coupled with t he phys ical depth of the site, ma kes the
Garcia Pasture Site unique for the area .
It ls clear then from our present knowledge that Garci a
Pasture is situated in a key position for the understanding and
interpretation o f the archeology near the mouth of the Rio Grande.
Its significance to the prehistory of the area cannot be overemphasized.
