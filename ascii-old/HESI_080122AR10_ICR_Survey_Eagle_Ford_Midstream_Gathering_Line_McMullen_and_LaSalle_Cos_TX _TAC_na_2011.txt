ABSTRACT

Between 25 and 31 May 2011, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of 23 US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
jurisdictional areas along a proposed Eagle Ford Midstream, LLC (EFM) 26.0-mile (41.8kilometer [km]) natural gas gathering line right-of-way (ROW) and 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW
located in southwestern McMullen and southeastern LaSalle counties, Texas. Overall, the Area
of Potential Effect (APE) of the proposed ROWs totals 170.9 acres. However, the USACE
jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROWs total only 2,300.0 feet (701.0 meters [m]) in
length (5.3 acres). For purposes of discussion, the USACE jurisdictional areas consist of each
wetland or waterway crossed by the proposed ROWs as well as the associated uplands on
opposing sides of each wetland/waterway. Although the proposed ROWs will be located
entirely on private property and will be constructed with private funds, the crossing of areas
under the jurisdiction of the USACE may require the usage of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) in
compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1976. As a NWP is a federal permit, the
areas within the purview of the USACE along the proposed ROW also fall under the regulations
of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. At the
request of Zephyr Environmental Corporation (Zephyr), Horizon conducted the cultural
resources survey of the 23 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROWs on behalf of
EFM in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine
if any archeological sites were located within the 23 USACE jurisdictional areas, if any existed,
to determine routes around those sites with the potential to be eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Other USACE jurisdictional areas along the
proposed ROWs that will be spanned via horizontal directional drills (HDD) were not assessed
as these HDD spans serve to avoid any potential impacts to the USACE jurisdictional areas and
do not require the usage of a NWP.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new prehistoric
archeological site (41MC550) along the proposed 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW. As the site’s
boundaries may extend beyond the assessed limits of the proposed lateral ROW, the overall
NRHP eligibility status for site 41MC550 is considered to be undetermined. However, based on
the presence of only shallow cultural deposits and the lack of preserved floral and faunal
materials, the portion of this site within the proposed lateral ROW is considered to be a
noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility of the site. Aside from 41MC550, no

Management Summary

other cultural resources were documented within the 23 investigated USACE jurisdictional areas
along the proposed ROWs.
Based on the assessment that the portion of site 41MC550 within the proposed lateral
ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the
site, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of EFM’s proposed 26.0-mile (41.8-km) natural
gas gathering line ROW and 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that EFM be allowed to proceed
with the undertaking, relative to the jurisdiction of the USACE and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the proposed ROWs within areas under the purview of the USACE and the
regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
and USACE should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of 23 US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional areas along a proposed Eagle Ford Midstream,
LLC (EFM) 26.0-mile (41.8-kilometer [km]) natural gas gathering line right-of-way (ROW) and
2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW located in southwestern McMullen and southeastern LaSalle
counties, Texas (Figures 1-1 through 1-8). Overall, the Area of Potential Effect (APE) of the
proposed ROWs totals 170.9 acres. However, the USACE jurisdictional areas along the
proposed ROWs total only 2,300.0 feet (701.0 meters [m]) in length (5.3 acres). For purposes
of discussion, the USACE jurisdictional areas consist of each wetland or waterway crossed by
the proposed ROWs as well as the associated uplands on opposing sides of each
wetland/waterway. Although the proposed ROWs will be located entirely on private property
and will be constructed with private funds, the crossing of areas under the jurisdiction of the
USACE may require the usage of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) in compliance with Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act of 1976. As a NWP is a federal permit, the areas within the purview of the
USACE along the proposed ROW also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
At the request of Zephyr
Environmental Corporation (Zephyr), Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the 23
USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROWs on behalf of EFM in compliance with
Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological
sites were located within the 23 USACE jurisdictional areas, if any existed, to determine routes

be spanned via horizontal directional drills (HDD) were not assessed as these HDD spans serve
to avoid any potential impacts to the USACE jurisdictional areas and do not require the usage of
a NWP.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of 23 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROWs, and the
production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure,
Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural
Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director)
served as the project’s Principal Investigator, while Jared Wiersema (Horizon staff archeologist),
Michael Placher, and Katherine Harrington conducted the field investigations.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area between 25 and 31 May 2011. This
entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts within 23 USACE
jurisdictional areas and their associated uplands along the proposed ROWs. Other USACE
jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROWs that will be spanned via a HDD were not
assessed as these HDD spans serve to avoid any potential impacts to the USACE jurisdictional
areas and do not require the usage of a NWP. For the purposes of this survey, each USACE
jurisdictional area along the proposed ROWs was considered to measure approximately 100.0
feet (30.5 m) on each side of each USACE jurisdictional waterway by 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide
(0.2 acres each). Overall, the 23 assessed USACE jurisdictional areas total 5.3 acres.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size.
With this in mind, a total of 11 shovel tests would have been necessary to meet the TSMASS
within the USACE jurisdictional areas. Rather than lumping the total acreage of all the 23
USACE jurisdictional areas together for this specific survey, the Horizon field crew set out to
excavate a minimum of 4 shovel tests at each USACE jurisdictional area; 2 shovel tests on
opposing sides of each USACE jurisdictional area. By doing so, Horizon exceeded the
minimum survey standards by excavating a total of 98 shovel tests within the 23 USACE
jurisdictional areas along the 2 proposed ROWs.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new prehistoric
archeological site (41MC550) along the proposed 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW. As the site’s
boundaries may extend beyond the assessed limits of the proposed lateral ROW, the overall
NRHP eligibility status for site 41MC550 is considered to be undetermined. However, based on
the presence of only shallow cultural deposits and the lack of preserved floral and faunal
materials, the portion of this site within the proposed lateral ROW is considered to be a
noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility of the site. Aside from 41MC550, no
other cultural resources were documented within the 23 investigated USACE jurisdictional areas
along the proposed ROWs.
Based on the assessment that the portion of site 41MC550 within the proposed lateral
ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the
site, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of EFM’s proposed 26.0-mile (41.8-km) natural
gas gathering line ROW and 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that EFM be allowed to proceed
with the undertaking, relative to the jurisdiction of the USACE and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the proposed ROWs within areas under the purview of the USACE and the
regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
and USACE should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

EFM’s proposed 26.0-mile (41.8-km) natural gas gathering line ROW and 2.2-mile (3.5km) lateral ROW are located in southwestern McMullen and southeastern LaSalle counties,
Texas (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). They can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5minute Tilden, Texas, Fitzpatrick Hollow, Texas, Mule Creek, Texas, Loma Alta NW, Texas,
Piedra Creek NE, Texas topographic quadrangle maps (see Figure 1-1). The total APE for the
entire project consists of 2 ROWs totaling 148,896.0 feet (45,383.5 m) in length and 50.0 feet
(15.0 m) in width, with an overall area of 170.9 acres. However, the USACE jurisdictional areas
along the proposed ROWs total only 2,300.0 feet (701.0 m) in length (5.3 acres).
Representative images of the proposed ROW at the time of the cultural resource survey are
presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-5.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed ROWs are located in southwestern McMullen and southeastern LaSalle
counties in south Texas. These extensive ROWs extend across rangeland and chaparral
typical of south Texas. Elevations along the length of the proposed ROWs range between
approximately 220.0 feet (67.1 m) and 340.0 feet (103.6 m) above mean sea level.
Hydrologically, the proposed ROWs are situated within the Nueces River basin. The entire
length of the 26.0-mile (41.8-km) natural gas gathering line ROW somewhat parallels the
Nueces River which is located a short distance southeast of this ROW. This ROW is generally
drained to the southeast into the Nueces River by numerous waterways including Quintania
Creek, Green Branch, Guadalupe Creek, and Mule Creek. The 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW
actually extends across the Nueces River. It drains to the southeast and northwest via overland
sheet flow into the Nueces River and via Winn Lake Slue and Elm Slue, both of which converge
with the Nueces River a short distance away from the lateral ROW.

2.3

CLIMATE

The climate in McMullen and LaSalle counties is generally mild in the winter, with an
average temperature of 55.5 degrees. In the summer months, the average temperature is 84.7
degrees, with an average daily maximum temperature of 97.2 degrees. The average annual
total precipitation is about 23.42 inches. Of this, about 21.08 inches, or 90 percent, usually falls
in February through November. Thunderstorms occur on about 37 days each year, with most
occurring in May (NRCS 2011a).

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The proposed ROWs are located in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province (WWF 2005) and
the South Texas Plains vegetational region (Gould 1975). The upland areas support a rich
tapestry of south Texas chaparral. The vegetation of the undeveloped and uncleared areas can
be characterized as brush country, with variably dense scrub ranging in height from 4 to 10 feet.
The Tamaulipan/Mezquital ecoregion of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico has
unique plant and animal communities containing tree- and brush-covered dunes, wind tidal flats,
and dense native brushland. These communities contain such species as ocelot, jaguarondi,
reddish egret, the Texas indigo snake, and over 400 species of birds (WWF 2005).
Species in the project area that provide recreational opportunities include white-tailed
deer, javelina, wild turkeys, mourning and white-winged doves, bobwhite and scaled quail,
rabbits, and feral hogs. Coyotes, gray foxes, bobcats, and mountain lions are also present and
contribute to the diversity of local wildlife. More forested brush areas provide nesting and
foraging areas for some of these species, and the neighboring rangelands and other open
areas provide additional foraging areas. Amphibians and reptiles were not directly observed in
the creek or riverine areas of the project area. Suitable habitat for various snakes, frogs, and
salamanders is present.

Wildlife resources in the project vicinity include species normally anticipated in a rural,
agricultural setting. Habitat availability is limited for the most part to natural areas associated
with watercourses along the proposed route. These areas provide cover and some foraging
opportunities. Open areas, including cleared pastureland, allow wildlife to forage and move
more easily through the project area.
Although there are large acreages of cultivated land on the South Texas Plains, most of
the area is still rangeland. Land holdings predominantly are large cattle ranches. Deer and
other wildlife species are common. This area originally supported a grassland or savannah type
climax vegetation. Long continued grazing and other factors have altered the plant communities
to such a degree that ranchmen of the region now face a severe brush problem (Gould 1975).
The vegetation of the undeveloped and uncleared areas can be characterized as brush
country, with variably dense scrub ranging in height from 4 to 10 feet. Mesquite and associated
thorny shrubs, such as catclaw acacia, huisache, blackbrush, granjeno, whitebrush, prickly
pear, and Spanish dagger are common locally. Understory vegetation is characteristically
sparse. Along major drainages, live oak, Texas sugarberry, cedar elm, and retama occur. Little
bluestem, bristlegrass, paspalums, windmill grass, and buffelgrass are dominant grasses.

SOILS

A minimum of 12 soil types are mapped within the boundaries of the 23 USACE
jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROWs. These soils are presented in Table 2-1 (NRCS

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The prehistory of South Texas can essentially be divided into 3 major periods: (1)
Paleoindian (9200–6000 BC); (2) Archaic, which has been subdivided into the Early Archaic (ca.
6000–2500 BC), Middle Archaic (ca. 2500–400 BC), and Late Archaic (ca. 400 BC–AD 800);
and (3) Late Prehistoric (AD 800–1600). These prehistoric periods are principally defined by the
presence of particular diagnostic projectile points, but they are intended to designate general
cultural patterns based on ecology, technology, and subsistence strategies (Black 1989:48-57;
Suhm et al. 1954).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9200–6000 BC)

Evidence of Paleoindian occupations in South Texas (9200–6000 BC) usually consists
of surface finds found most frequently in the Nueces-Guadalupe and Rio Grande plains. Only 2
stratified Paleoindian sites have been excavated in the region: Buckner Ranch (Sellards 1940)
and Berger Bluff (Brown 1987). Both sites were deeply buried in alluvial terraces. Diagnostic
projectile point styles of the Paleoindian period include Clovis (Meltzer 1986), Folsom (Largent
et al. 1991), Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura (Black 1989:48-49). Finely flaked end
scrapers fashioned on blades and bifacially worked Clear Fork tools are also diagnostic of the
Paleoindian period. Paleoindian peoples have traditionally been characterized as terminal
Pleistocene big-game hunters, but these highly mobile hunter-gatherers probably exploited a
rich diversity of wild plant and animal foods. Investigations at Baker Cave, for instance, indicate
that a diverse array of fish, snakes, and rodents was exploited by the Paleoindian occupants
(Hester 1983). Paleoindian populations were probably organized into small groups that ranged
over great distances across periglacial plains and marginally forested areas to acquire different
food sources throughout the year (Black 1989:48).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6000 BC–AD 800)

The major distinction of the Early Archaic period (6000–2500 BC) is the replacement of
earlier lanceolate-shaped projectile points by stemmed and corner-notched types. These styles
include Bell, Andice, Early Triangular, and Early Expanding Stemmed points such as Bandy,
Martindale, Uvalde, and related forms (Turner and Hester 1985). Other diagnostic artifacts
include Clear Fork tools and large, thin, triangular bifaces with concave bases. The beginning of
the Early Archaic period marks the onset of the modern Holocene era, during which the

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

periglacial climate of the late Pleistocene began to grow warmer. Available evidence from the
Gulf Coastal Plain suggests that population densities remained low through the beginning of the
Archaic period in South Texas, reflecting a continuation of the highly mobile adaptations of the
Paleoindian period.
The Middle Archaic period (2500–400 BC) in South Texas is defined by the presence of
Pedernales, Langtry, Kinney, Bulverde, and Tortugas projectile point styles (Bell 1958; Turner
and Hester 1985). Distally beveled tools are also common during this period, and ground stone
tools, such as tubular grinding stones and manos, appear for the first time (Black 1989:49). Site
densities in South Texas increase markedly during the Middle Archaic, possibly reflecting a
decrease in group mobility and/or an increase in territoriality among groups (Black 1989:51). A
heavier reliance on vegetal foods may be indicated by the introduction of ground stone
technology and the appearance of large burned rock middens throughout Central Texas.
Late Archaic (400 BC–AD 800) occupations in South Texas are defined by small cornerand side­notched dart points, including Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Fairland, and Ellis types (Bell 1958,
1960; Turner and Hester 1985). Site densities continue to increase throughout the Late Archaic
period, possibly indicating that population densities continued to rise. Cultural deposits on Late
Archaic sites also tend to be deeper than during preceding periods, suggesting that occupations
were either more extended in duration or that reoccupation of the same locations was more
frequent (Black 1989:51). Cemeteries appear during this period, possibly indicating higher levels
of social organization and increasing territoriality (Black 1989:51). During the Late Archaic, the
exploitation of different ecological niches continued to intensify, becoming increasingly oriented
toward the exploitation of seasonal food sources. This kind of adaptation is best illustrated by
the frequent occurrence of shell middens along the coast and burned rock middens farther
inland. Data collected from inland sites indicate that the economy was based primarily on
vegetal resources supplemented with the hunting of small game such as rodents and rabbits
(Black 1989:51).

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 800–1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period is defined by the appearance of pottery and the
bow and arrow. The small dart points of the Late Archaic period were largely replaced by arrow
points (Black 1989:52). The Late Prehistoric period in South Texas has been divided into 2
distinct time horizons, the Austin (AD 800–1350) and Toyah (AD 1350–1600) phases (Black
1986). The Austin phase is characterized by the presence of Scallorn arrow points, while the
Toyah phase is defined by the presence of Perdiz arrow points. Faunal resources became
increasingly important during this period, especially large mammals such as bison and deer.
Lithic tool kits seem to have been manufactured for the processing of large mammals (Black
1989:51-57). Late Prehistoric sites are relatively common throughout South Texas, which might
be interpreted as the result of population increases. The movement of bison from Central to
South Texas may coincide with a movement of peoples and/or technology from both the Austin
and Toyah phases of Central Texas (Black 1989:51-57).

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 1520 TO PRESENT)

The historic era of South Texas began with the arrival of Europeans in the region and
can be subsumed within the overall history of Texas. In South Texas, the historic era has been
divided into 3 time periods: (1) Spanish Exploration and Colonial (ca. AD 1520–1821); (2)
Mexican (1821-1836); and (3) Texas-American (ca. 1836 to present). The Protohistoric era in
this region can generally be incorporated within the early part of the Spanish Exploration and
Colonial period.
Protohistoric
Records from the initial Spanish expeditions provide the earliest ethnohistoric accounts
of the Coahuiltecan-affiliated groups indigenous to the Rio Grande Plain (Hester 1989a:1-4;
1989b:77-82). Based on fragmentary ethnohistorical records, it appears that these people—part
of an extinct cultural group that occupied lands stretching from South Texas deep into Mexico—
were highly nomadic hunter­gatherers who moved in a seasonal pattern within distinctive
territories (Hester 1989a). Available evidence suggests that Coahuiltecans living in the Rio
Grande Plain (as well as in other parts of South Texas and northern Mexico) subsisted on a
number of seasonal food sources, ranging from prickly pear in the fall to bison or deer in the late
fall or winter, as well as small mammals and roots during off­seasons or in times of hardship
(Hester 1989b:77-81).
Two causes can be cited for the early destruction of the Coahuiltecan groups on the Rio
Grande plain. The primary reason stems from the great period of unrest among Native
American groups generated by the introduction of the horse by the Spanish. Groups who
adopted the horse (especially the Apache and the Comanche) eagerly took to raiding
neighboring groups. Nomadic peoples such as the Coahuiltecans were especially vulnerable to
such pressure, as they could neither consolidate for protection nor occupy defensible positions
without risking starvation. Therefore, finally, the Coahuiltecans asked for missions to be
established in their territories in order to protect them from the Apache and Comanche raiders.
After the establishment of the Spanish missions in South Texas during the first half of the 18th
century, the remnants of the indigenous Native American groups were rapidly integrated into the
mission system or were subjected to outright extinction by depredation or disease (John
1975:171-174).
Spanish Colonial
The first European incursion into Texas was by Alvarez de Pineda in 1513 during the
course of a Spanish mapping expedition. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after
being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay (Folan et al. 1989:85). Between
1688 and 1717, Spanish explorers such as Mazanet and Espinosa passed through the Rio
Grande Plain from Mexico on their way to the Caddoan settlements in northeast Texas (Hester
1989b:80-81). These early Spanish explorers recorded observations about the aboriginal
groups in the region, but they were primarily engaged in consolidating territory for the Spanish
Crown.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Following the founding of San Antonio in 1718, the town of Laredo was established
along the Rio Grande in 1755 when rancher Tomas Sanchez de la Berrera y Gallardo was
granted permission by the great Spanish colonizer, Jose de Escandon, to form a new
settlement. Located in the province of Nuevo Santander, which included most of northeastern
Mexico and parts of present-day Texas, Laredo was one of a series of settlements that
Escandon established or authorized as part of Spain’s effort to colonize the area south of the
Nueces River (Clark and Juarez 1986:85; Folan et aI. 1986:6).
Mexican and Texas-American
Prior to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, a Spanish garrison was established in Laredo
to minimize the effects of depredations by Lipan Apache and Comanche raiders. In 1790, a
daring attack on the city overran the garrison and exploded the powder magazine, deepening
fears “that the Comanches’ efforts to sweep through south Texas were succeeding” (Briggs
1982:7). Once the Texas-Mexico border was established along the Rio Grande in 1848, the role
of protection in the Laredo area passed to the United States. In 1849, a company of mounted
infantry under 2nd Lieutenant E.L. Viele arrived to establish an army post on “some high flats
west of the city, opposite a ford and just north of a bend in the Rio Grande” (Briggs 1982:7) on
the Texas side of the river about 3/4ths of a mile west of the old Spanish town of Laredo.
Originally named Camp Crawford (or Camp Laredo), the name of the post was changed in 1850
to Fort McIntosh in honor of Lieutenant Colonel James S. McIntosh, who died in September
1847 from wounds received at the Battle of Molino del Rey during the Mexican-American War
(Frazer 1972). When construction began in 1850, the general military objective of the Fort was
to provide “escort service to caravans of travelers and [to reduce] Indian depredations and
general outlawry” (Briggs 1982:8).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of 3 previously recorded archeological sites within a
1.0-mile perimeter of the proposed ROWs (THC 2011), while a review of the National Park
Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer also indicated the presence of no historic
properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2011). The previously recorded
archeological sites and their distances from the proposed ROW are summarized in Table 4-1
below. No previously recorded archeological sites, cemeteries, or historic properties, including
any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the
proposed ROWs. Based on the Atlas data, no previous cultural resources surveys have been
conducted along the proposed ROWs.

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the overall length of the proposed
ROW, as well as the location of the proposed ROW on elevated landforms adjacent to
numerous waterways and their tributaries, it was Horizon’s original opinion that there existed a
relatively high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural resources at select locations along
the proposed ROW.
In regard to historic-era resources, no structures are visible in proximity to the proposed
ROWs on the relevant topographic quadrangles. This suggested a decreased potential for
undocumented historic-era standing structures within the proposed ROWs. However, given the
overall length of the proposed ROWs, it was Horizon’s original opinion that there existed at least

a moderate potential for historic-era cultural deposits at select locations along the proposed
ROWs.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the 23 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROWs between 25 and 31 May 2011.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts within 23
USACE jurisdictional areas and their associated uplands along the proposed ROWs that were
delineated by a Zephyr field biologist. Other USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed
ROWs that will be spanned via a HDD were not assessed as these HDD spans serve to avoid
any potential impacts to the USACE jurisdictional areas and do not require the usage of a NWP.
For purposes of this survey, each USACE jurisdictional area along the proposed ROWs was
considered to measure approximately 100.0 feet (30.5 m) on each side of each USACE
jurisdictional waterway by 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide (0.2 acres each). Overall, the 23 assessed
USACE jurisdictional areas total 5.3 acres.
The TSMASS require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring
between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size. With this in mind, a total of 11 shovel tests would have
been necessary to meet the TSMASS within the 23 investigated USACE jurisdictional areas.
Rather than lumping the total acreage of all the 23 USACE jurisdictional areas together for this
specific survey, the Horizon field crew set out to excavate a minimum of 4 shovel tests at each
USACE jurisdictional area; 2 shovel tests on opposing sides of each USACE jurisdictional area.
By doing so, Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a total of 98
shovel tests within the 23 USACE jurisdictional areas along the 2 proposed ROWs. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.0-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. If any new sites were recorded, standard site forms were to be
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory for permanent housing. A
selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only diagnostic
cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or for return
to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the
field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were
completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS

units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. Shovel test locations
are presented in Figures 5-1 through 5-4. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the 23 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed
ROWs resulted in the documentation of 1 new prehistoric archeological site (41MC550). This
site is described below.

6.1

SITE 41MC550

General Description
Site 41MC550 was documented as a moderate-density prehistoric occupation located on
the 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW portion of the undertaking. It is situated on an elevated ridge
located approximately 200.0 m (656.2 feet) southeast of Winn Lake Slue and approximately
600.0 m (1968.5 feet) southeast of the Nueces River (Figures 6-1 and 6-2). The ridge on which
the site is located is composed of shallow clay soils covered with dense stands of prickly pear
cactus, scattered mesquite trees, and sparse short grasses (Figures 6-3 and 6-4). Overall, the
surface visibility across the site ranged from 50% to 75%. While the area just southeast of the
site has been historically cleared for a well pad or other activity, the site itself appears to be
generally intact with the exception of the presence of several shallow looter holes scattered
across the site.
A total of 7 shovel tests were excavated along the length of the proposed lateral ROW
across the site. Of these, only 3 produced evidence of shallow cultural deposits within the limits
of the currently proposed ROW. However, based on the landform, it is likely that the deposits
extend to the west and east beyond the limits of the assessed ROW. As such, the entirety of
the site was not assessed.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41MC550 consist primarily of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The bulk of the observed lithic specimens consists of lithic debitage. The observed
debitage assemblage is comprised of tan, reddish, and gray fine-grained chert, with all phases
of the lithic reduction sequence (i.e., primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes) represented. A
total of 6 bifacially worked lithic specimens were observed on the site’s surface. These include
4 bifaces/fragments that appear to have been abandoned early during the thinning process, 1
stemmed biface that may have been a planned dart point that appears to have been abandoned
due to a thick step fracture, and 1 complete Matamoras dart point (Figures 6-5 and 6-6).

Chapter 6.0: Results

The recovered Matamoros dart point is a finely worked specimen made from finegrained tan chert. It measures 3.2 mm in length and 2.2 mm across its base, and it has a
maximum thickness of 5.0 mm. This specimen was originally thought to be a small Tortugas
point. However, studies conducted on similar specimens recovered from Choke Canyon
demonstrated that Tortugas points range between 4.9 and 6.7 mm, while Matamoros points
range between 3.2 and 4.7 mm (Hall, Black, and Graves 1982). As the specimen from site
41MC550 measures 3.2 mm in length, it was assigned to the Matamoros style. This Matamoros
dart point is the only temporally diagnostic lithic specimen recovered from the site, suggesting a
Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric occupation of the site (Turner and Hester 1985).
In addition to the noted chert specimens, sparse amounts of fire-cracked rock (FCR)
were noted scattered across the site’s surface. No intact concentrations of FCR suggestive of
hearths or burned-rock middens were observed on the site, although the noted FCR specimens
suggest that some form of cooking features may have once been present at the site.
Aside from the documented lithic specimens, the only other observed cultural material
consists of a sparse amount of freshwater mussel shell. Five specimens of mussel shell were
observed on the site’s surface and 4 small fragments were recovered from subsurface deposits
on the site. These specimens suggest that freshwater mussels made up at least a small potion
of the diet of the site’s inhabitants. No other faunal remains were documented on the site, nor
was any evidence of preserved floral remains (e.g., charcoal).
Cultural Features
While several fragments of FCR were noted on the surface of the site and might
represent dispersed hearths or similar cooking features, no intact cultural features were
observed on the surface of the site, and no evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted
within any of the 3 positive shovel tests excavated on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of positive shovel tests and the extent of the observed surface
materials, the horizontal extent of site 41MC550 measures approximately 30.0 m (98.4 feet)
northwest-southeast along the length of the proposed ROW by 15.2 m (50.0 feet) northeastsouthwest within the width of the proposed ROW. Based on the landform traversed by the
proposed ROW, it is probable that the site extends beyond the limits of the proposed ROW.
The vertical extent of the site ranges between 0.0 and 42.0 centimeters below surface
(cmbs) (0.0 and 16.5 inches). The vast majority of the cultural materials are confined to surface
contexts across the dense clay soils comprising the site. Within its subsurface context, the
highest frequency of the cultural materials occurred between 0 and 20.0 cmbs (0 and 7.9
inches), while 1 chert flake and 1 small shell fragment were recovered from a maximum depth of
42.0 cmbs (16.5 inches). No cultural materials were recovered from below this depth. A
breakdown of materials by depth is presented within the shovel test data in Appendix A.

LaSalle County, Texas

Summary
Site 41MC550 was documented as a moderate-density prehistoric occupation located on
the 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW portion of the undertaking. The site consists primarily of lithic
flaking debris and several bifacially worked specimens. Of the bifacially worked specimens, 1
consists of a temporally diagnostic Matamoros dart point that suggests an occupation of the site
during the Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric periods. The vast majority of observed cultural
material is confined to the eroding clay surface of the site, although sparse amounts of materials
were recovered from subsurface contexts, primarily between 0.0 and 20.0 cmbs (0.0 and 7.9
inches), but with a maximum depth of 42.0 cmbs (16.5 inches). While several specimens of
freshwater mussel shell were noted on the site, no other preserved floral or faunal remains were
encountered during the documentation of the site.
As the site’s boundaries may extend beyond the assessed limits of the proposed lateral
ROW, the overall NRHP eligibility status for site 41MC550 is considered to be undetermined.
However, based on the presence of only surficial and shallow subsurface cultural deposits and
the lack of preserved floral and faunal materials, the portion of this site within the proposed
lateral ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility of the
site.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

Between 25 and 31 May 2011, Horizon archeologists conducted a cultural resources
survey of 23 USACE jurisdictional areas along a proposed EFM 26.0-mile (41.8-km) natural gas
gathering line right-of-way (ROW) and 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW located in southwestern
McMullen and southeastern LaSalle counties, Texas. This entailed intensive surface inspection
and subsurface shovel testing efforts at each of the 23 USACE jurisdictional areas. The
TSMASS require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 3.0 and
10.0 acres in size. With this in mind, a total of 11 shovel tests would have been necessary to
meet the TSMASS within the 23 investigated USACE jurisdictional areas. Rather than lumping
the total acreage of all the 23 USACE jurisdictional areas together for this specific survey, the
Horizon field crew set out to excavate a minimum of 4 shovel tests at each USACE jurisdictional
area; 2 shovel tests on opposing sides of each USACE jurisdictional area. By doing so, Horizon
exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a total of 98 shovel tests within the 23
USACE jurisdictional areas along the 2 proposed ROWs.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new prehistoric
archeological site (41MC550) along the proposed 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW. As the site’s
boundaries may extend beyond the assessed limits of the proposed lateral ROW, the overall
NRHP eligibility status for site 41MC550 is considered to be undetermined. However, based on
the presence of only shallow cultural deposits and the lack of preserved floral and faunal
materials, the portion of this site within the proposed lateral ROW is considered to be a
noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility of the site. Aside from 41MC550, no
cultural resources were documented within the 23 investigated USACE jurisdictional areas
along the proposed ROWs.

7.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the assessment that the portion of site 41MC550 within the proposed lateral
ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the
site, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of EFM’s proposed 26.0-mile (41.8-km) natural
gas gathering line ROW and 2.2-mile (3.5-km) lateral ROW will have no adverse effect on

HJN 080122 AR 10

37

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that EFM be allowed to proceed
with the undertaking, relative to the jurisdiction of the USACE and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the proposed ROWs within areas under the purview of the USACE and the
regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately and the THC and USACE should be notified
of the discovery.
