1. Project Description
Red River Archaeology, LLC (RRA) has been contracted by Atmos Energy Corporation (Atmos) to
conduct archaeological monitoring of the replacement of a 1.25-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline
located within Oakwood Cemetery and extending under adjacent Grand Avenue public right of way
(ROW) in Tarrant County. The project area is located within the city limits of Fort Worth,
approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the city center and depicted on the Haltom City, Tex. 7.5
minute topographic quadrangle (USGS 1981) (Figure 1). More specifically, the project area is
located along Grand Avenue, 160 feet (ft) northeast of the Grand Avenue – Gould Avenue
intersection. The purpose of the project is to replace an existing Atmos natural gas pipeline with a
new pipeline. The new pipeline will connect to an existing gas meter located at the south façade of a
metal maintenance building within Oakwood Cemetery. The existing pipeline will be abandoned in
place.
The proposed archaeological Area of Potential Effects (APE) coordinated with the THC in the permit
application consisted of a 6.12-meter wide (20 ft) Atmos easement beginning in the privately-owned
Oakwood Cemetery at the existing meter and extending 21.15 meters (m) (69 ft 4 inches) in a
northwesterly direction to the center-line of Grand Avenue. However, during monitoring, the area of
impact was modified and shortened by the construction contractor. No excavation was performed
within the paved roadway of Grand Avenue as originally anticipated and the trench was excavated
only to intersect with the existing gas line and did not extend to the gas meter. The final APE was
shortened from the coordinated length of 21.15 m to the 15.66 m of the actual trench excavation.
Depth of impact is anticipated to exceed 1 m (3 ft). Although Atmos will be replacing additional gas
lines along the north drive lane and right of way of Grand Avenue, this area is beyond the 25 ft buffer
area surrounding the cemetery and was not recommended for monitoring per TAC 13 § 26.7 (Figure
2).
Oakwood Cemetery is not a public cemetery and does not fall under the statutory requirements of
TAC 9.191.093: Protection of publicly owned cemeteries. However, in accordance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas, RRA proposed to conduct archaeological construction monitoring of the
proposed APE as 0.012 acres is located within City of Fort Worth ROW. The remaining section of
the APE (.018 acres) is within privately-owned Oakwood Cemetery and was also monitored during
construction. No federal undertaking is anticipated for this project; therefore, consultation under
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) is not required. In the event that a
burial(s) was encountered, the project would follow the requirements of the Texas Administrative
Code Title 13 Part 2 Chapter 22: Cemeteries; the Texas Health and Safety Code Title 8 Subtitle C
Chapter 711: General Provisions Related to Cemeteries; the Texas Penal Code Title 9 Chapter 42
Section 42.08: Abuse of Corpse; and Title 7 Chapter 31.03: Theft.
The proposed project is located within an historic-age cemetery which is listed as a Registered Texas
Historic Landmark (RTHL) and designated TR-CO77. A separate consultation has been submitted to
the Architectural Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) on 11 March 2015 due to the
RTHL designation. In reply dated 26 March 2015, the Architectural Division agreed with the
proposed scope of work and stated that the project “will not affect any historic feature or designated
landscape elements of the cemetery” provided areas of trenching are returned to pre-construction
condition.
Fieldwork was conducted under the supervision of Charles D. Neel, and Sarah M. Cole, MA, RPA,
served as Principal Investigator for the project. Fieldwork was completed on 12 May 2015. The
trench excavation location was subjected to 100 percent monitoring (Figure 2). Two general areas of

mixed modern and historic glass, ceramic, brick, metal, and composite material were documented
from monitored back-dirt during the excavation of the pipeline trench and were recorded as Isolated
Finds (IFs) Locality-1 and Locality-2. No graves, grave shafts, or associated artifacts were
encountered during construction monitoring. All records associated with this project will be curated
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. It is recommended that artifacts recovered from IF
Locality-1 (in City of Fort Worth ROW) be discarded as they are highly redundant and lack historical,
cultural, or scientific value. Artifacts recovered from IF Locality-2 are located on private property
and will be returned to the landowner.

2. Definition of Study Area
The study area of this report is restricted to an irregularly shaped 0.030-acre tract (pipeline easement)
located 160 ft northwest of the Grand Avenue – Gould Avenue intersection in Tarrant County and
depicted on the Haltom City, Tex. 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle (USGS 1981) (see Figure 1).
From the existing gas line, the APE extends for 12.60 meters (41 ft 4 inches) within the cemetery (to
the cemetery fence), then 3.06 meters (10 ft) to the east curb line of Grand Avenue (City of Fort
Worth ROW). This APE comprises 0.0225 acres of which 0.018 acres (80 percent) are within the
privately-owned Oakwood Cemetery and 0.0045 acres (20 percent) are within City of Forth Worth
ROW (Figure 3). The replacement pipeline portion under Grand Avenue was completed by bore.
The project is located in the Central Texas section of the Great Plains Province as defined by
Fenneman (1931:54-57) which is underlain by a thick limestone bedrock that dips gently to the south
and east to the Coastal Plain. The elevation of the project area is 580 ft above mean sea level (amsl)
and lies at the southeastern edge of an upland ridge overlooking a large bend of the West Fork Trinity
River near downtown Fort Worth.
Geology of the project area is mapped as Early Pleistocene-age Fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt) of
sand, silt, clay and gravel (Barnes 1987). The project area is comprised of one mapped soil unit
within the APE: Bastsil-Urban land complex, 0 to 5 percent slopes. The soil description for this unit
is an A horizon of light brown loamy fine sand 15 centimeters (cm) thick overlying an E horizon of
light brown loamy fine sand to 41 centimeters below surface (cmbs). A series of B horizons of red
and strong brown sandy clay loams extend to a depth of 203 cm. The attributes of this soil map unit
is summarized in Table 1. The project area is currently manicured lawn of the Oakwood Cemetery
and asphalt pavement of Grand Avenue with grass strip adjacent to the roadway.

3. History of Oakwood Cemetery
Oakwood Cemetery was first established in 1879 when John Peter Smith donated 20 acres for the
formation of a cemetery. The cemetery was laid out in three joining parcels that included, from north
to south, a “Colored” Cemetery, a City Cemetery and a Catholic Cemetery. Grand Avenue was later
laid-out to the west of the original cemetery parcel and the cemetery expanded westward to that
boundary. In 1912 a chapel was built on a small triangular island at the intersection of Grand Avenue
and Gould Avenue. A portion of Grand Avenue that extended to the cemetery was later closed and
the small island church is now within the cemetery proper. The APE of the project area is located
within that triangular addition which was never platted for burials. Oakwood Cemetery is a private
cemetery managed by a cemetery association (Oakwood Cemetery 2015; Strickland 2015).

4. Previous Investigations
A background review was completed for previously recorded sites, archaeological surveys, and
National Register listings located within one mile of the APE of the proposed 0.030-acre project area
for the Atmos natural gas pipeline replacement. The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and
Texas Historic Sites Atlas (THSA) online database were reviewed on 6 March 2015. Eleven
properties and markers are located within one mile of the project APE (see Figure 1). The Oakwood
Cemetery is recorded as a RTHL and a historic marker is located within the cemetery, 290 m to the
east of the project APE. Five additional historic markers are located within one mile of the project
APE. More than one subject and date is indicated on several of the historic marker locations in
TASA and this seems to indicate multiple markers at these locations. Two National Register (NR)
Districts are located within one mile of the project APE. The Marine (Mercado) Commercial Historic
District is located 670 m to the northeast and the Grand Avenue Historic District is located 620 m to
the west of the APE. Two National Register listed properties are located within one mile of the
project APE. The Fort Worth High School building is located 1370 m to the northwest and the
Henderson Street Bridge is located 1560 m to the southeast of the project APE. Information on these
11 properties and markers are summarized in Table 2.
Five previously conducted archaeological surveys have been performed within one mile of the project
APE (see Figure 1). These are linear and block surveys conducted for highway and pipeline projects
and are summarized in Table 3. No archaeological sites were recorded during these surveys and no
known archaeological sites are located within one mile of the project APE.
Recent and historic maps for 1918, 1954, 1958, 1968, 1972, 1973, 1981, and 1995 of the project APE
were examined for current and former land-use patterns (USGS 1918 [1894], 1954, 1958, 1968
[1955], 1972 [1955], 1973, 1981 [1955], and 1995). No structures are indicated in the area until the
chapel was constructed in 1912. The RTHL marker for Oakwood Cemetery indicates the chapel was
constructed in 1914 however the corner stone bears a date of 1912.

5. Management Summary
This work was performed by Red River Archaeology, LLC, in compliance with the Antiquities Code
of Texas under contract with Atmos. Field work was conducted under TAC Permit #7216. Sarah M.
Cole, RPA, served as Principal Investigator, and fieldwork was conducted by Charles D. Neel. All
fieldwork was performed on 12 May 2015 and 15.66 m of trench excavation was monitored for
cultural resources. No prehistoric or significant historic artifacts were observed or documented. No
burials or evidence of burial shafts, or cultural or non-cultural features were documented.

6. Research Design and Field Methodology
In accordance with 13 TAC 26.15 and Texas Historical Commission (THC) policy, RRA performed
monitoring of the hand excavation of the gas pipeline replacement trench. The trench was excavated
with hand shovels by four crew workers provided by Pantheon Construction, under contract with
Atmos for the pipeline replacement project. Excavation was begun at the southeast curb line of
Grand Avenue and extended southeast to the gas meter location. The completed trench was 15.66 m
long and varied in depth from 117 cm at the curb line to 51 to 69 cm along most of its length. The
deep section at the curb line was necessary to receive the pipe bore which extended under an existing
water line under Grand Avenue. The trench width generally did not exceed 35 cm except at the bore
receiving pit at the curb line (76 cm wide) and at the existing gas line tie-in (81 cm wide) (Figure 4).
The primary objective of the monitoring was the examination of trench walls and floors for evidence
of pit features that may indicate the presence of graves or grave shafts. However, all excavated soil
was examined by individual shovelful as it was removed from the trench. The upper sandy loam

horizons readily fragmented during the excavation and random or systematic screening of back dirt
samples was not warranted.
Field forms generated during this investigation were completed with pencil on acid-free paper and
GPS coordinates were documented for the trench begin and end points and the locations of trench
wall profiles. Fieldwork was supervised by an archaeologist meeting the Secretary of the Interior’s
Professional Qualification Standards for Archeology and the Professional Qualifications and
requirements as defined in 13 TAC 26.4. RRA collected and processed all artifacts at the RRA Dallas
artifact laboratory.

7. Results
Two general areas of mixed modern and historic glass, ceramic, brick, metal, and composite material
were documented from monitored back-dirt during the excavation of the pipeline trench (Figure 5).
This data is tabulated in Appendix A. No artifacts were documented in situ in trench walls or floor.
Due to the close association of recovery, these areas were recorded as Isolated Finds (IFs) Locality-1
and Locality-2. The artifact assemblages, although defined as Localities, are used for presentation of
data only and do not imply that these artifacts represent an historical association or deposition.
Examination of the trench profile indicates no pit features, cross trenches, or historic disturbances
were evident in the natural stratigraphy. This would indicate that the historic artifacts and modern
items recovered were likely discarded on the surface and incorporated into the upper soil horizon by
bioturbation and their association is fortuitous. Three soil profiles were drawn of the southwest
trench wall: at the deepest part of the trench near the curb line (Profile A), just southeast of the
location of IF Locality-1 (Profile B), and at the location of IF Locality-2 (Profile C) (Figure 6).
Trench profiles document four soil strata and represent an A/E/Bt1/Bt2 soil sequence and were
recorded in the field as Soil Zones I through IV (Figure 7). All artifacts and modern items were
recovered from the upper A1 soil zone. Soil Zone I is a very dark brown (10YR2/2) sandy loam and
thickens from 8 cm at the curb line to 28 cm at the meter tie-in from northwest to southeast along the
length of the trench. All artifacts and modern items were recovered from this upper organic horizon
unit. Soil Zone II is a reddish brown (5YR4/3) silty sand documented from 8 to 41 cmbs and also
slightly thickens toward the southeast. Soil Zone III is a reddish brown (5YR4/3) loamy clay
documented from 33 to 60 cmbs and only the upper portion of this horizon was exposed by
excavation in most of the trench. Soil Zone IV is a yellowish red (7.5YR4/6) clay mottled with
brown (7.5YR5/4) clay and containing redox concentrations of manganese. This zone was only
exposed in the pipe bore receiving hole at the curb line.
7.1 Isolated Find Locality-1
Isolated Find Locality-1 is a collection of 20 historic to modern items of glass, metal and a brick
fragment (Figure 8). These items were recovered from the upper 19 cm of the soil column within
back-dirt excavated along the 2.0 to 3.0 m section of the pipeline trench. Twelve fragments from one
small bottle in the liquor/spirits category were recovered and are heavily patinated. These are 10
body shards, one base shard, and the finish with aluminum cap. The bottle is in the Plain Oval shape
and the base shard is embossed with mold numbers of 608 over 8. One body shard has embossed
letters of “W FORBIDS…..E OF THIS B,” a partial inscription of FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS
SALE OR REUSE OF THIS BOTTLE which was authorized by federal law to be printed on all
liquor bottles from 1935 until discontinued in 1964 (IMACS 2001:472.8). Bottles with this
embossing may have been in use for a few years after 1964 until the factory supply of embossed

bottles were exhausted. The bottle finish is a ‘small external threaded screw cap’ design most
generally used after 1920 (SHA 2015). One glass shard of purple (manganese) glass was recovered.
The shard has a segment of a panel line and may indicate a proprietary panel bottle. Manganese was
discontinued as a clarifying agent in 1917 and indicates a general 1880-1925 time period for this
shard (IMACS 2001:472.10), again allowing for factory supply of bottles to be exhausted.
One colorless body shard of a bottle exhibits no wear or abrasion marks and appears to be modern.
Two fragments of thin sheet metal were recovered and exhibit no attributes to indicate function. Two
glass shards of blue opaque glass and one of opaque white glass were recovered. These shards
resemble the many colored kitchen glassware items produced during the Depression years by a
number of companies. The blue shards resemble blue Delphite ® glass produced by the Jeannette
Glass Company in the 1930s (Florence 1987:22-23); although, many companies produced an opaque
blue glass line under other trade names. All three shards are thin and flat and may be from small plate
or saucer forms. The brick shard is a fragment of a manganese brick with glazed surface and does not
match the brick utilized in the church building. The materials recovered from Locality-1 are a
mixture of modern and historic items located adjacent to the roadway of Grand Avenue at the
cemetery fence and likely represent toss material from passersby, road and utility construction debris,
and perhaps construction and use debris associated with the 1912 church building.
7.2 Isolated Find Locality-2
Isolated Find Locality-2 is a collection of four historic to modern items of glass, ceramic, and
composite material (see Figure 8). These items were recovered from the upper 24 cm of the soil
column within back-dirt excavated along the 15.0 to 15.66 m section of the pipeline trench. One
brown glass body shard of a bottle exhibits no wear or abrasion marks and appears to be modern.
One colorless body shard of a bottle is lightly patinated, exhibits mold intrusion streaks, and wear or
abrasion marks and is likely of the historic period. A composite material of tar or asphalt with
fiberglass strands was recovered and may be modern roofing material from the maintenance shed
located immediately east of the trench excavation. One ceramic shard has a black transfer print of a
maker’s mark of “CARTWRIGHT’ over “SEMI-GRAN” and is a partial mark of CARTWRIGHT
BROS. SEMI-GRANITE. This mark is illustrated in Lehner (1988:84) and the complete mark shows
the wording contained within a ribbon held in the mouth of a griffin. The mark is attributed to the
Cartwright Brothers Pottery of East Liverpool, Ohio and was discontinued in 1924. The materials
recovered from Locality-2 are modern and historic items located adjacent to the modern maintenance
shed and within the yard of the 1912 church building and likely represent mixed construction and use
debris associated with these two structures.

8. Recommendations
This report documents the cultural resources monitoring of a 15.66 m long pipeline trench excavation
at the Oakwood Cemetery and along City of Fort Worth public street right of way. The primary
objective of the monitoring was the examination of trench walls and floors for evidence of pit features
that may indicate the presence of graves or grave shafts. No graves, grave shafts, or associated
artifacts were encountered during construction monitoring.
Two areas of mixed historic artifacts and modern items were documented and represent 20th century
use and discard of debris along Grand Avenue and in the church yard of Oakwood Cemetery.
Isolated Finds, by their nature, are unassociated objects without context and are not eligible for listing
to the NRHP. It was recommended that construction proceed as planned with no further cultural
resources investigations. All field records will be curated in accordance with the Texas Archeological

16

Research Laboratory guidelines. It is recommended that artifacts recovered from IF Locality-1 (in
City of Fort Worth ROW) be discarded as they are highly redundant and lack historical, cultural, or
scientific value. Artifacts recovered from IF Locality-2 are located on private property and will be
returned to the landowner.
