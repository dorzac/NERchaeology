ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of approximately 2.51 acres for the City of Abilene’s
proposed Possum Kingdom Raw Water Roughing Facility, located on the west side of
Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek in Breckenridge, Stephens County, Texas was conducted by
American Archaeology Group LLC in December 2014 under the auspices of Antiquities
Permit Number 7092 and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
One prehistoric archaeological site (41SE321) was recorded as occupation site based on
the presence of two small burned rocks and two tertiary flakes on the surface and one
mussel shell fragment. Site 41SE321 (Appendix III) was recorded as a prehistoric
occupation site in which radiocarbon dating of freshwater mussel shell recovered from
BHT-2 at 130 centimeters below the surface (Beta Analytic Sample Number 399076)
yielded a Conventional Radiocarbon date of 6 , 0 0 0 +/- 3 0 B.P. (Before Present)
(calibrated range 4,800-4,975 B.C., Appendix IV), thus indicating cultural deposits dating
to Early Archaic in age. Below the freshwater mussel shell at 249 centimeters below the
surface, plastic trash was encountered, thus providing evidence of extensive disturbances
and proving a mixed context of any deposits that may remain. No intact features or
defined stratigraphy were encountered, therefore, this site is not considered eligible for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of designation as
a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).

INTRODUCTION
American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) is assisting the City of Abilene with
the permitting process required to proceed with improvements at 2.51 acres for the
proposed Possum Kingdom Raw Water Roughing Facility(PKRWRF), located on the
west side of Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek in Breckenridge, Stephens County, Texas
(Figure 1). The PKRWRF will implement Possum Kingdom Lake as a raw water supply
under the City of Abilene’s Second Stage Short-term Drought Strategy. In December
2014, AAG conducted an archaeological survey and testing in the project area, which
covers approximately 2.51 acres on the west side of Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek, south of
Highway 180 (Figure 2). This report describes the implementation and results of the
investigation. Funding for the project was provided by the City of Abilene.
The investigation was designed to detect prehistoric and/or historic cultural
resources that could potentially be impacted by the proposed PKRWRF improvements.
Fieldwork was authorized by the Texas Historical Commission (Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 7092) and comprised systematic surface survey at 5 meter intervals and subsurface
testing was completed through backhoe trenching and shovel testing. At the time
fieldwork was undertaken, approximately 90% of the project area had been subjected to
various impacts in the past including cutting and filling, parking lot construction, oilfield
equipment yard, and a baseball field. There were several major utility lines and other gas
and water lines that traversed through the project area. These impacts are extensive as
noted by the presence of backfill rock and trash in the western portion of the project area.
The project area is depicted on the 7.5’ U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle
Breckenridge (Figure 2). The U.T.M. coordinates for the approximate center of the tract
are Zone 14 Northing 362376 and Easting 509143. Appendix I contains the Research
Design and Scope of Work. The nearest water source is Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek
immediately east of the project area. The topographic position of the project area is 1182
feet in elevation above mean sea level (amsl).
Previous archaeological surveys in Stephens County have identified significant
prehistoric and historic sites. Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd Inc. contracted with American
Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) to perform an archaeological survey under the
auspices of the Texas Antiquities Code pursuant to Antiquities Permit Number 7092, and
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

ENVIROMENTAL SETTING
Natural Setting
This section was previously prepared by AAG (Griggs et al. 2007:4). The project
area is located in the Cross Timbers and Prairies ecological region of Texas (Gould
1975). This region covers 67,340 square kilometers (26,000 square miles) in the north
central portion of the state (Figure 3). Potential vegetation is alternating bands of wooded
habitat scattered throughout prairie dominated by one-three foot tall grasses (TPWD
2007a). Historic anthropogenic disturbances have significantly altered native plant
communities. Common trees present today, particularly in the vicinity of Stephens
County, include pecan, mesquite, hackberry and elm. Grasses include broom weed, wild
rye and milkweed. The topography is broken with hilly plateaus. Average annual rainfall
levels in the Cross Timbers region grade higher from east to west. In Stephens County the
average annual rainfall is 67.1 centimeters (26.4 inches). Average temperatures range
from a low of 31° F in January to a high of 98° F in July (Leffler 2007).

Soils
This project contained only one known soil variety known as Gageby clay loam,
occasionally flooded (Ga). Typical profiles of this soils are 0-22 inches clay loam; 22-42
inches clay loam; and 42-60 inches clay loam (Cypiran 1994). These loamy alluvium
soils are located in linear deposits along floodplains such as Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek,
which is a perennial stream at this location.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Cultural Sequence
This section was previously prepared by AAG (Griggs et al. 2007:8-11). The land
that is now Texas has been occupied by human populations for more than 11,000 years.
A chronological framework developed by archaeologists for the interpretation of Texas
history comprises five general temporal periods whose boundaries correspond to
significant cultural and social developments (Nunley 1989:37-46). These periods and
their approximate dates are as follows: 1) Paleoindian (11,500- 8500 before present
[hereafter B.P.]); 2) Archaic (8500-1200 B.P.); 3) Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800-1450); 4)
Protohistoric (A.D. 1450-1650); and 5) Historic (A.D. 1650-1940s).
The Paleoindian period begins during the last Glacial and continues into the early
Holocene. The earliest confirmed Paleoindian populations in Texas were small, highly
mobile bands of hunters armed with distinctive fluted “Clovis” projectile points who
pursued large, late Pleistocene mammals, most notably mammoths (Surovell 2000;
Turner and Hester 1985; Waguespack and Surovell 2003). Later Paleoindian populations
developed new forms of projectile points and refined their hunting strategies in response
to environmental factors such as the extinction of the mammoth and other
megamammals; yet despite these adaptations, they maintained life ways more like those
of their predecessors than those of later Archaic populations.
The complete demise of the Pleistocene big-game animals and climate change
accompanying the onset of the Holocene are linked to shifts in stone tool technology,
subsistence pursuits and settlement patterns that define the Archaic period. The
Paleoindian-Archaic transition, like those between succeeding periods, occurred
gradually. As the Pleistocene megamammals began to vanish, indigenous populations
focused on smaller game and increased their reliance on local plant foods. With changes
in subsistence came new and more diverse stone toolkits and an increase in tools made of
wood and other organic materials. Additionally, settlements became more stable, and
there is evidence for progressively sophisticated cultural practices, such as systematic
burial of the dead (Bousman et al. 2002). Although the Archaic hunting and gathering
lifeway remained relatively stable for thousands of years, archaeologists are able to
define four sub periods (or eras) – Early, Middle, Late and Transitional – based on a
dated sequence of diagnostic projectile points (Turner and Hester 1985:47-49).
The Late Prehistoric period is marked in some areas of Texas, including the north
central region, by the introduction of domesticated plant foods such as corn and beans.
Technological innovations such as pottery and the bow and arrow were widely adopted
(Nunley 1989:44; Turner and Hester 1985:82).
The Protohistoric period is associated with an incipient European presence in the
region. Protohistoric indigenous populations were the first described in early
ethnohistoric accounts. Often, these accounts reflected only indirect contact. Items of
European manufacture are occasionally found in Protohistoric sites, though in most cases

6

these items were not acquired directly but through so called down-the-line trading
(Nunley 1989:45).
The Historic period is characterized by a firm historical record and increasing
direct contact between indigenous and European explorers and settlers. Horses introduced
by the Spanish and European material culture led to profound changes in indigenous
cultures. Eventually, Old World diseases, resettlement and warfare claimed up to 95% of
Texas Indians (Klos 2007). The latter part of the Historic period encompasses the AngloEuropean settlement of Texas.
Local Archaeological and Historical Context
In Stephens County 320 archaeological sites are registered with Texas Historical
Commission. The vast majority of these are located in the north central and northeastern
part of the county along the Clear Fork of the Brazos River and on Hubbard Creek
downstream from the Hubbard Creek Reservoir (RCRI 2014). The distribution of these
sites reflects both a predilection on the part of prehistoric populations for riparian
settlements, which provided access to fresh water and game animals, and a recent surge
in archaeological surveys along river ways targeted for reservoir projects.
Sites dating to all periods of the cultural chronology outlined in the section above,
with the exception of the Protohistoric, are represented in site records for Stephens
County (RCRI 2014). It is possible that some of the registered Late Prehistoric sites were
occupied in the Protohistoric period, but this is difficult to demonstrate since most
material remains from the Protohistoric are indistinguishable from those of the Late
Prehistoric. Paleoindian sites are truly rare in the county; only one has been registered
(site 41SE78). Most prehistoric sites have been assigned to the Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods on the basis of temporally diagnostic artifacts, primarily arrow points.
Two sites from these periods (41SE2 and 41SE3) contain rock art, which is uncommon in
north central Texas (Figure 4; Jackson 1938: 292-295). Around 15% of sites in the
county contain historic components that range from simple surface scatters of historic
debris, such as glass and metal, to oilfield camps and buildings. The County Courthouse,
located in Breckenridge, has been designated as a State Archaeological Landmark (RCRI
2014).

1938:plates CCXIV, CCXV).
The best documented period of prehistory in north central Texas is the Late
Prehistoric. During this period a large block of north central Texas, including much of
Stephens County, was occupied by interrelated populations whose shared cultural traits,
(e.g., artifact types and adaptive strategies) are referred to by archaeologists as the
Henrietta Focus. The Harrell site, located only a few miles north of Stephens County at
the confluence of the Brazos River and Clear Fork, is the “type site,” or ideal example, of
the Henrietta Focus (Krieger 1946:137). Current estimates place the chronological range
of the focus between A.D. 1200-1600 (Lynott 2007). Inhabitants of the Harrell site and
other Henrietta Focus sites were maize agriculturalists and hunters. Bison was the
preferred game, but deer, antelope and other small mammals, as well as turtles, turkey,
ducks and fish also contributed to the subsistence base. The material culture of the
Henrietta Focus is uniquely represented by a shell tempered pottery, Nocona Plain.
Other artifacts associated with the focus, though not exclusive to it, are small, triangular
Harrell and Washita arrow points (Figure 5), diamond-shaped and leaf-shaped bifaces,
manos, metates, bison scapula hoes, deer ulna flakers and disc beads made of perforated
mussel or Olivella shell (Krieger 1946:137-141; Lynott 2007). These artifacts, as well as
a farming and hunting subsistence base, link the Henrietta Focus to a broader cultural
tradition, the Plains Villager Horizon, which extends across the river valleys of the
Southern Plains. Trade relations with groups to the west are indicated at Henrietta Focus

8

sites by the occurrence of stone tools made of agatized dolomite from the Alibates Flint
Quarry in the Texas Panhandle and Puebloan pottery from the New Mexico area (Krieger
1946:111-112, 119).

During the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, north central Texas
witnessed the arrival of the Comanche, Kiowa and Tonkawa Indians. These groups are
believed to have migrated from the Great Basin and High Plains regions after acquiring
Spanish horses. All three were nomadic and depended on the buffalo for their subsistence
(Mayhall 2007; Lipscomb 2007; Carlisle 2007).
In the late 1850s, Anglo settlers began moving into north central Texas, and in
1858 the Texas legislature established what is now known as Stephens County (the
original name of Buchanan County was changed to Stephens in 1861 in honor of the vice
president of the Confederate States of America). Though early settlers were constantly
harassed by raiding parties of Comanche and Kiowa Indians until the early 1870s, the
population of the county grew steadily, reaching 4,725 by 1880 (Leffler 2007).
The first waves of Anglo settlers in Stephens County were primarily cattle
ranchers. By the late nineteenth century, however, cotton and corn farming provided a
significant contribution to the local economy. Cotton production fell precipitously
following a boll weevil infestation in the first decade of the twentieth century, but that
bad fortune was eventually eclipsed by an oil boom that began in 1916 with a strike at a
well near Caddo. Additional fields were soon discovered, and by 1922 Stephens County
accounted for 15 percent of all the oil produced in the United States. The boom lured
thousands of new residents to the county, as well as eighty-nine oil companies and two
railroads. Although production slowed by the mid-1920s, oil remains a significant
industry in the county. Other key industries in Stephens County today are recreation,
livestock agriculture and manufacturing. Manufactured products include mobile homes,
furniture, aircraft parts, petrochemical and oilfield equipment (Leffler 2007; Hunt 2007).
The current project area is located adjacent to Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek, named
in honor of Dr. Peter Gunsolus (1801-1886) who came to the Breckenridge area in the
1850s (Open Plaque 2014). Dr. Gunsolus lived and practiced medicine in Shackleford,
Parker and Stephens Counties, Texas, eventually settling on Duck Creek, which was later
renamed in his honor as Gunsolus Creek, yet the United States Geological Survey has
erroneously labelled the creek as “Gonzales Creek” (Open Paque 2014).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Shelton (2009) conducted an archaeological survey for the Stephens Regional
Special Utility District (RSUD) Waterline Improvements immediately north and south of
the current project area next to Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek. One prehistoric lithic
procurement site was recorded (41SE307). The site was determined to be ineligible for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.
Griggs et al. (2007) surveyed approximately 2.98 acres for proposed
improvements at the Anniversary Park, located on the west side of Lake Hubbard Creek
in Stephens County, Texas in March 2007. The planned project consisted of
improvements at a boat ramp location within Anniversary Park, south of Highway 180.
Approximately 90% of the project area has been subjected to various impacts in the past
including cutting and filling, parking lot construction, and boat ramp construction. No
archaeological sites were encountered

10

PROJECT METHODOLOGY
The project was divided into three phases – archival research, field survey, and
report preparation. The archival research consisted of a check for records of registered
sites in the online “Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,” which is maintained by the Texas
Historical Commission, as well as a review of other literature for publications concerning
previous work in the county.
The field investigation was conducted in December 2014. The field investigation
involved a pedestrian surface survey supported with backhoe trenching and shovel testing
(Figure 2; Appendix I-II). The survey was conducted systematically across the entire
2.51 acre project area, with members of the survey team inspecting the ground surface
along linear transects spaced at 5 meter intervals. Approximately 90% of the ground
surface of the project area had been disturbed by prior earth moving activities. Other
surface disturbances included asphalt pavement and industrial debris such as concrete
slabs (Appendix I). Visibility of the ground surface was obscured by patches of short
grasses. Three backhoe trenches (BHTs) were excavated to test for subsurface deposits
of cultural remains and two shovel tests were placed in the area where prehistoric cultural
materials were observed on the surface. Samples of soil from each BHT were screened
through ¼” hardware cloth.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
A review of the archaeological literature for Stephens County revealed no
previously recorded sites within the project area. There were three sites worth referencing
which include 41SE5, 41SE301 and 41SE32. The first is an exposed bedrock mortar
(prehistoric) with five “eye-shaped” mortar holes. This site is located on a peninsula
extending into Hubbard Creek Reservoir northeast of the project area. Site 41SE301 lies
to the west of the project area, just north of Hwy 180. It is the ruin of an historic
homestead. Several sherds of glass and historic earthenware were recovered during a
surface collection at the site, and a cistern was documented. Site 41SE32, located west of
41SE301, is described as a prehistoric campsite with a Late Prehistoric component.
Several chipped stone tools and a Scallorn arrow point were recovered during a surface
survey. No additional field research was recommended at any of the three sites by the
archaeologists who documented them.
Field Survey
The field investigation conducted for this project covered approximately 2.51
acres along the floodplain of Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek in Breckenridge, Stephens
County. Roughly 90% of the project area had been heavily disturbed by prior earth
moving activities. The survey included a systematic inspection of the ground surface of
the project area supported by backhoe trenching and shovel testing to test for subsurface
deposits. One unknown prehistoric occupation site (41SE321) was recorded based on the
presence of two small burned rocks and two tertiary flakes on the surface. Site 41SE321
(Appendix III) was recorded as a prehistoric occupation site in which radiocarbon
dating of freshwater mussel shell recovered from BHT-2 at 130 centimeters below the
surface (Beta Analytic Sample Number 399076) yielded a Conventional Radiocarbon
date of 6 , 0 0 0 +/- 3 0 B.P. (Before Present) (calibrated range 4,800-4,975 B.C.,
Appendix IV), thus indicating cultural deposits dating to Early Archaic in age. Below the
freshwater mussel shell at 249 centimeters below the surface, plastic trash was
encountered, thus providing evidence of extensive disturbances and proving a mixed
context of any deposits that may remain. No intact features or defined stratigraphy were
encountered, therefore, this site is not considered eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL).

RECOMMENDATIONS
American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction within the
project area be allowed to proceed as planned. Monitoring during construction by a
professional archaeologist is not considered necessary. However, should any cultural
materials be exposed in any area not discussed in this report, all work in the immediate
area must cease until the situation can be evaluated by American Archaeology Group
LLC in consultation with the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission
and Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd, Inc.
