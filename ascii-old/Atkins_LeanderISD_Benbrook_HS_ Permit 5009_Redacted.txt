Management Summary
In August 2008, PBS&J conducted a cultural resources survey of a 171-acre area in Williamson County,
Texas, at the request of Leander Independent School District. The project area is proposed for future
construction of Leander Independent School District’s Benbrook Middle and High Schools. One cultural
resource site (41WM1205) was located. No artifacts were collected, but field records will be curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Cultural resource clearance is recommended for the
project.

I. INTRODUCTION
In August 2008, PBS&J conducted a cultural resource survey for the Leander Independent School District
in southwest Williamson County, Texas, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5009. The project area is
proposed for future construction of Leander Independent School District’s Benbrook Middle and High
Schools. The purpose of the investigation was to locate, describe, document, and assess all existing
cultural resources that would be affected by the proposed project. The investigation included a site
records search, a review of historic maps and an intensive pedestrian survey. The project area is
approximately 171 acres (69 hectares) in area centered approximately 400 meters (m) east of County
Road 279, 600 m north of Oak Grove Road and 4 kilometers (km) north-northwest of the city center of
Leander (Figure 1). The archeological field investigation was conducted by PBS&J archeologists Kelley
Russell and Erin Watkins. Kelley Russell served as project archeologist and primary author of this report
of investigations under the direction of Principal Investigator Michael Nash.
This study was performed in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas
Natural Resources Code of 1977) and other appropriate cultural resources legislation and guidelines, as
well as the guidelines set forth by the Register of Professional Archaeologists and the Council of Texas
Archeologists.

II. METHODOLOGY
Prior to the field investigation, PBS&J conducted a records search at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in order to identify any previous cultural resource investigations and/or previously
recorded sites within 2 km of the project area. This search included all recorded cultural resource sites as
well any sites listed on or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or designated
as State Archeological Landmarks. Modern and historic United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps
and historic Texas Highway Department Maps of the project area and vicinity were also reviewed.
PBS&J archeologists conducted an intensive 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project area utilizing
parallel pedestrian transects spaced approximately 30 m apart. In accordance with the scope of work,
shovel tests were only excavated in areas of low surface visibility or perceived potential for buried
deposits. Due to the high degree of ground surface visibility (Figure 2a), surficial outcrops of limestone
bedrock (Figure 2b) and heavily disturbed soils due to past cultivation and other activities (Figure 3), a
total of 28 shovel tests were excavated.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
PHYSIOGRAPHY/GEOLOGY
The project area is situated on level to moderately sloping uplands in the Texas Hill Country.
Topographic maps depicts two separate tributaries of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River flowing
within the southern and northern limits of the project area. Field investigators did not observe any
drainage in the southern portion of the project area as depicted on USGS topography maps. A very
shallow, bedrock and limestone cobble–lined drainage was observed by the field investigators in the
north-central portion of the project area (Figure 4). Water was not present in the drainage at the time of
survey.
The Texas Hill Country is a highly dissected plateau characterized by a predominant oak-juniper
woodland/shrubland interspersed with pastures dominated by scattered trees and short to mid grasses and
forbs (Hatch et al. 1990). McMahan et al. (1984) identify the project area and vicinity as Oak-MesquiteJuniper Parks/Woods. Field reconnaissance of the project area confirms these vegetation
characterizations.
According to the Williamson County soil survey (Werchan and Coker 1983), the project area is situated
on Brackett gravelly clay loam, 3 to 16 percent slopes, Crawford clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes, Denton silty
clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, Denton silty clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes, Doss silty clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes,
Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes, Eckrant-Rock Outcrop Complex, rolling, Fairlie clay, 1 to
2 percent slopes, and Georgetown clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes.

III. Environmental Setting

The Brackett series soils are found on uplands and consist of shallow, well-drained loamy soils with
limestone fragments and occur in the easternmost portion of the project area, occupying less than
1 percent of the area. The Crawford clay series consists of moderately deep, well-drained clayey soils
overlying fractured limestone on uplands and occurs in the fallow plowed fields in the southern portion of
the project area, comprising about 20 percent of the total area. Denton soils are moderately deep, welldrained, clayey soils overlying limestone on uplands and are associated primarily with fallow plowed
fields in the northwestern and southernmost areas in the project area, accounting for about 13 percent of
the soils in the project area. The Doss series, comprising about 12 percent of the project area, consists of
shallow, well-drained clayey soils on uplands with limestone fragments overlying cemented limey earth
and limestone. The Eckrant series, found in the central and northeastern portions of the project area, is the
most common soil series, accounting for close to 40 percent of the soils. Eckrant soils consist of shallow
to very shallow, well-drained, stony and clayey soils overlying limestone on uplands. The Fairlie series
consists of deep, moderately well-drained clayey and calcareous soils on uplands overlying weakly
cemented limestone. This soil is found in the north-central portion of the project area, occupying
approximately 15 percent of the soils in the project area. The Georgetown series consists of moderately
deep, well-drained loamy and stony soils on uplands overlying fractured limestone. Georgetown soils
occur in the easternmost portion of the project area and account for less than 5 percent of all soils.

CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGY
The prevailing local climate is humid subtropical. Summers are usually long with hot days and warm
nights (Werchan and Coker 1983). Winters are normally mild with occasional polar air intrusions of short
duration and below-freezing temperatures occurring less than 25 days each year. Temperatures in the area
range from an average high of 95 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) (35 degrees Celsius [°C]) in summer to an
average low of 38°F (3°C) in winter. The average annual precipitation is approximately 34 inches
(87 centimeters [cm]) and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year.

FLORA
The project area occurs on nearly level uplands within the Edwards Plateau vegetational region of Texas,
as described by Hatch et al. (1990), with open pasture in the southern and northwest corner of the project
area (Figure 5a) consisting of various grasses and forbs, including Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense),
Canadian wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Japanese brome (Bromus japonicum), little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), goldenrod (Solidago sp.), and plain’s tickseed (Coreopsis tinctoria). The
central and northeastern portions of the project area (Figure 5b) are dominated by Ashe juniper (Juniperus
ashei), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), live oak (Quercus virginiana), and prickly pear (Opuntia
engelmannii). Surrounding land uses include agriculture, and residential and commercial development.

FAUNA
The project area is along the eastern edge of the Balconian biotic province, as described by Blair (1950).
Wildlife species of potential or actual occurrence in the project vicinity include such mammalian species

Avian wildlife species of potential occurrence in the project vicinity include species such as Carolina
chickadee (Poecile carolinensis), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), western scrub-jay
(Aphelocoma californica), golden-fronted woodpecker (Melanerpes aurifrons), and mourning dove
(Zenaida macroura). Common reptiles species include green anole (Anolis carolinensis), Texas spiny
lizard (Sceloporus olivaceus), little brown skink (Scincella lateralis), and Texas ratsnake (Elaphe
obsoleta).

IV. CULTURAL BACKGROUND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A TARL records search identified four previously recorded cultural resources within 2 km of the project
area, although none lies within the project area itself. These sites are 41WM254, 41WM269, 41WM475,
and 41WM476.
Site 41WM254 is located approximately 820 m northwest of the project area and consisted of a heavily
looted burned rock midden. No information regarding the investigators or when the site was recorded
could be found (TARL site files.)
Site 41WM269 lies about 2 km south of the project area. It was recorded in 1974 and is the site of the
former town of Bagdad. Bagdad was founded in 1854 by Charles Babcock, who was originally from
Ohio. Bagdad was a stop on the Austin to Fort Crogan (later Burnet) Stage Line. Bagdad Cemetery was
established in 1857 when Babcock donated the land on which his young son John Babcock was buried to
the town. The cemetery is still in use today. The town thrived in the 1860s and 1870s and by 1882 had
two blacksmith shops, a hotel, two schools, a Masonic lodge, three churches, and several stores. In that
year, the Austin and Northwestern Railroad was built 1 mile east of the town, and settlers and businesses
soon began to move near the railroad, establishing the town of Leander around the site of railroad. By the
turn or the century, Bagdad was virtually abandoned (City of Leander 2008).
Site 41WM475 lies 1,300 m northeast of the project area along the west bank of a tributary to the South
Fork of the San Gabriel River. Connie Meyers of the University of Texas at Austin first recorded the site
in 1980 as a prehistoric campsite spanning 3 acres and containing several burn rock middens. The site lies
on private property and had been heavily looted and bulldozed at the time of the initial investigation. In
1985, a group of avocational archeologists and volunteers revisited the site. The site had been further
looted as evidence by many large potholes throughout the site. In 1989 the site was revisited by John
Parvin, who reported the site as being nearly destroyed by pothunting. Artifacts observed and reportedly
found at 41WM475 include shell beads, preforms, scrapers, bone, mussel shell, and dart points including
the Ellis type (TARL site files)
Site 41WM476 lies approximately 1,400 m northeast of the project area along the east bank of a tributary
to the South Fork of the San Gabriel River. The site was recorded by Connie Meyers of the University of
Texas at Austin in 1980 as a prehistoric lithic scatter likely associated with 41WM476 directly across the
creek (TARL site files)

V. CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Williamson County is located in the Central and Southern Archeological Planning Region of Texas
(Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996). The cultural developments in the region are usually classified by
archeologists according to four primary chronological and developmental stages. These are the
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. Changes in material culture over time have been
used as indicators of the four temporal periods. One general theoretical tenet that underlies this
classification scheme is that change in material culture reflects behavioral and cultural adaptation to
change in the natural and manmade environment.
The earliest occupations documented for the area date to the Paleoindian period. This period, beginning
prior to 10,000 B.C. and continuing to about 6000 B.C., coincides with the decline of the Wisconsin
glaciation and is characterized by a relatively cool, moist climate. Paleoindian populations were
apparently small groups of transient hunters whose lifeways revolved around the exploitation of
now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna such as mammoth, mastodon, camel, and bison. However, in most
areas, particularly outside of the Great Plains, big-game hunting was probably supplemented by
exploitation of plants and smaller game.
The distinctive tool kit of the Paleoindian period includes finely chipped and sometimes fluted
lanceolate-shaped projectile points. In chronological order, the Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina,
Scottsbluff, and Angostura projectile point types are typically recognized as characterizing the period
(Black 1989). Most of the evidence for Paleoindian occupations is based on surface finds. Few intact sites
dating to this period have been recorded or investigated in this region partly because Paleoindian deposits
are deeply buried in various alluvial settings or are difficult to locate and study due to their ephemeral
nature. However, at least three Paleoindian sites in the central Texas area have been recorded and
investigated; these include the Kincaid Rockshelter (41UV2) in Uvalde County (Collins et al. 1988), the
Levi site (41TV49) in Travis County (Alexander 1963), and the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) in
Williamson County (Collins 1988).
At the end of the Paleoindian period, the archeological record exhibits evidence of a diversification of
subsistence patterns that marks the beginning of a long (6000 B.C. to A.D. 800) and complex chronological
period referred to as the Archaic (Hester et al. 1989). The Archaic period is commonly divided into three
or more subdivisions, most often designated as the Early (6000 to 3000 B.C.), Middle (3000 to 1000 B.C.),
and Late (1000 B.C. to A.D. 800). The Archaic period cultures are generally characterized as having a
more diversified resource base than earlier groups, with subsistence dependent on hunting modern species
of game including deer and rabbit, and gathering edible roots, nuts, and fruits (Black 1989). Site types
include rockshelters, campsites, lookout sites, and quarry sites. These sites are usually located near a
reliable water source.
Early Archaic groups continue to exhibit many of the characteristics of the preceding Paleoindian period,
and the early part of this period is sometimes referred to as transitional between the Paleoindian and the
100003425/080189

12

V. Cultural Chronology

Archaic periods. Most of the projectile points from this period are well made, and many exhibit
characteristics typical of Paleoindian technologies, such as lateral edge grinding. In addition, Early
Archaic artifact forms have been recovered beyond the boundaries of central Texas. The variety of
projectile point types distributed over such a large area has prompted Prewitt (1981) to suggest that these
people were organized in small, dispersed bands that roamed broad territories.
The Middle Archaic can be subdivided into early (Clear Fork) and late (Round Rock) intervals. Nolan and
Travis projectile points are indicative of the Clear Fork interval, and the Round Rock interval is marked
by Pedernales, Marshall, and Langtry points. The Langtry point is an especially common type in the
Lower Pecos. It was during the Middle Archaic that burned rock middens became a specialized site type
(Black 1989). This site type becomes extremely common during this period, suggesting an intensive and
perhaps rather specialized plant-processing economy. Weir (1976) has also suggested population increase
and possible developments in social organization during this period. Projectile points from this period are
quite numerous, occurring in large frequencies at some sites. They tend to be large and straight stemmed
and are often not as well made as points from earlier or later periods.
By the beginning of the Late Archaic, a proliferation of projectile point types again occurred, and burned
rock middens were either no longer created or had become a minor aspect of subsistence. Prewitt (1981)
has suggested that the proliferation of projectile points during the earliest phase of the subperiod may
represent a return to the Early Archaic pattern of small, dispersed bands with wide-ranging territorial
areas. The latter part of the Late Archaic appears to be marked by an emphasis on the utilization of a
variety of food resources, perhaps indicative of population or climatic stress at this time.
Projectile points diagnostic of the early part of the Late Archaic include Bulverde and Pedernales. Later in
the period, Darl, Ensor, Frio, and Mahomet points became prominent. Terrace locations are still the
primary locations for sites of this period but with less emphasis on midden sites, and rockshelters are
more commonly utilized.
The Late Prehistoric period is marked by the introduction of several technological advances, most notably
the bow and arrow and ceramics. The bow and arrow quickly became the standard weapon, replacing the
throwing stick, or atlatl, and small thin arrow points became a key indicator among the material remains
of the period. Sometime after the adoption of the bow and arrow, plainware ceramics were also
introduced into the area. This development probably came from agricultural groups to the east or
northeast. There are possible indications of major population movements, changes in settlement patterns,
and perhaps lower population densities during the Late Prehistoric period (Black 1989).
During the early Historic period, the time of European contact and settlement, the area was inhabited by
numerous aboriginal groups including the Jumano, Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche (Newcomb
1961). The Jumano initiated extensive trading activities with the Caddo in east Texas and the Trans Pecos
groups to the west (Suhm 1958). The Tonkawa, originally from Oklahoma, were one of many native
peoples displaced in the second half of the nineteenth century by the horse-using Apache and forced to

V. Cultural Chronology

move south and southwest (Newcomb and Campbell 1982). During the early part of the nineteenth
century, the Tonkawa, represented by a consolidation of remnants of diverse bands, occupied an area
between the Trinity and San Antonio rivers (Gatschet 1891; Newcomb 1961; Sibley 1922; Sjoberg 1953).
The Lipan Apache and Comanche entered the area from the Plains in pursuit of food. Their weapons
included the bow and arrow and lance. Trade items such as glass beads, European-made ceramics, gun
parts, and metal arrow points indicate a contact period occupation.

VI. RESULTS
The cultural resources survey was conducted in August 2008 by PBS&J archeologists Kelley Russell and
Erin Watkins. A total of 28 shovel tests were excavated within the project area. No prehistoric cultural
resources or sites were observed within the project area. One historic site, 41WM1205, was recorded
during the survey. The site is described below.

41WM1205
Site 41WM1205 is a newly recorded historic farmstead located in the north-central portion the project
area at an elevation of about 1,060 feet above mean sea level (Figure 6, map pocket, not for public
disclosure). Vegetation within the site included mature live oaks, junipers, prickly pear cacti, and pasture
grasses (Figure 7a). A mature fig tree and a plum tree were also present. Soils within the site are classified
as belonging to Doss silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes in the western portion of the site and Eckrant cobbly
clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes in the eastern part of the site (Werchan and Coker 1983). The majority of the
soil within the site belongs to the Eckrant series (Figure 7b), which was revealed in shovel tests to be a
shallow, very dark gray clay with over 70 percent gravels overlying limestone bedrock. The Doss series
was grayish brown silty clay overlying extremely dense silty brown clay. Ten shovel tests were performed
within the site’s boundary, all of which were negative.
Site 41WM1205 covers an area of 140 m north-south by 160 m east-west (Figure 8). Site dimensions
were determined by extant structural remains and the extent of historic artifacts on the ground surface. No
artifacts were recovered during shovel testing. Artifacts present on the site include a variety of glass,
ceramics, bricks, and metal (Figure 9). Glass artifacts observed include solarized, colorless, brown, blue,
milk glass, and window pane glass. Solarized glass was in production from about 1880 to 1918 (Stelle
2008). Ceramics present included blue and brown transferprint, annularware, porcelain, ironstone, and
stoneware. Various bricks and brick fragments were present, including Kooken brick and cut limestone
blocks. Kooken bricks were manufactured in Ellis County by the Kooken Brick Company from 1920 to
1923 (Steinbomer 1982). Metal artifacts present at the site included farm equipment fragments,
amorphous metal fragments, and sheet metal fragments.
The structural remains present at site 41WM1205 are a well, an electric water pump (Figure 10a), a
circular depression surrounded by cut limestone blocks (Figure 10b), extant metal animal pens (Figure
10c), a cattle chute, and an extant single-family dwelling.
The brick-and-concrete-lined well is located in the northwestern corner of the site. It appears partially
collapsed and filled in with debris. The electric water pump lies in the southwestern portion of the site and
is composed of two types of metal pumps upon a concrete foundation surrounded by approximately 4 feet
of cinderblock on three sides. A power pole with electric wire stands next to the water pump.
Approximately 20 m southeast of the water pump lies a debris-filled circular depression with a 15 m
diameter. Cut rectangular limestone blocks surround the depression. A metal pipe runs from the

depression to the northwestern portion of the site. The function of the depression is unclear, although it
probably held water at one time and may have been associated with the electric water pump. The animal
pens measure 10 x 50 m and consist of two structures. The first pen is wood pole supported and clad in
sheet metal. The roof is side gabled and clad in sheet metal. Abutting the first structure to the east is a
smaller wood-pole-supported pen with a shed roof clad in sheet metal on all sides.
The extant single family dwelling lies in the southeast portion of the site approximately 180 m southeast
of the location of the former structure in the northwestern corner of the site, The extant building has a
front-gabled roof with a shed-roof addition on the northeastern lateral façade (Figure 11). The roof is clad
in replacement corrugated metal sheeting. The original portion is clad in board and batten and has been
patched with tar paper and corrugated metal sheeting. The shed-roof addition is clad in vertical wood
siding that appears to have once been covered with rolled asphalt. The dwelling’s original main entry
appears to have been located in the gable end; however, it has since been covered. A new entry is located
in the shed-roof addition as well as two window openings. The windows are no longer extant. The
building has a pier-and-beam foundation with limestone piers. The dwelling is in derelict condition and is
currently abandoned. Based on the structural features of the dwelling, it appears to date to circa 1890.
Three shovel tests were placed around the structure, and all were negative for cultural material.
The northwestern portion of the site is bordered by a fence running along County Road 279. Domestic
artifacts, a push pile, a collapsed well, and mature fig and plum trees are present in this portion of the site.
It is believed by the investigators that a house once was present in this area, as supported by historic
maps.
A review of historic topographic maps was conducted to aid in accessing the age of site 41WM1205. An
1893 USGS Georgetown topographic map does not depict a structure at the location of the site. However,
this map shows only the locations of established towns at the time of publication and does not depict
known homes in the area that were constructed prior to 1893 (USGS 1893). The 1936 and 1953 General
Highway Maps (Texas State Highway Department 1936, 1953) depict structures at the location of the site.
The 1962 and 1979 USGS topographic maps (USGS 1962, 1979) depict several extant structures at the
location of 41WM1205, including two domestic structures and several outbuildings. One of the domestic
structures is depicted at a fence corner along County Road 279. During the field investigation, the
archeologists observed domestic remains including glass, ceramics, window pane fragments, bricks, and a
large push pile in this location. Another domestic structure is depicted along a two-track dirt road
southeast of the first structure. This is likely the location of the extant board-and-batten structure. The
1986 USGS topographic map (USGS 1986) depicts the same structures as the previous maps, with the
exception of the main house that is no longer present at this time.
A chain of title previously conducted for the project indicates that the entire project area, including site
41WM1205, was owned by the Faubion family from sometime prior to 1905 until the 1970s or later. Site
41WM1205 has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion
A or B, and no architectural remains of merit and design distinction to qualify for the NRHP under
100003425/080189

VI. Results

Criterion C. Given the disturbed context of the historic remains, the site also lacks integrity to qualify
under NRHP Criterion D for its potential information content. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the site is not eligible for listing in the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The field survey resulted in the location of one previously unrecorded cultural resource site, 41WM1205.
Site 41WM1205 is thought to represent the remains of a farmstead dating to the late nineteenth to early
twentieth century. Ten shovel tests were excavated at the site, and all were culturally sterile. Rural
domestic residences dating to this period are well documented in the regional literature. For this reason
and the lack of buried artifacts, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site does not meet
Criteria A, B, or D and thus does not warrant listing in the NRHP.
The extant structure at site 41WM1205 is of common vernacular design and construction methods and
does not exhibit any unique architectural features or design merit, nor does the building retain any known
historic associations. Many of its original materials are missing, replaced, or in a ruined state, thereby
detracting from the building’s integrity of workmanship, materials, and design. Thus, it is the opinion of
the Principal Investigator that this dwelling is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion C.
The USGS Nameless topographic map (USGS 1986) of the project area depicts the headwaters of a
tributary of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River within the northeastern portion of the project area. At
the time of survey, the drainage consisted of a very slight dry depression although the area had been
subjected to heavy rains in previous days. No lithic raw materials such as chert or quartzite were
observed, and no prehistoric cultural materials were observed.
Due to the lack of lithic resources and the lack of a source of surface water, this area holds a very low
potential for harboring prehistoric archeological sites. Historic site 41WM1205 does not meet the criteria
for listing in the NRHP. No further investigation is recommended in association with the proposed
project, and cultural resources clearance is recommended.
