ABSTRACT
Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas, better known as Presidio San Sabá, was
founded in 1757 in what is now Menard County, Texas. The presidio was part of the
Spanish crown’s effort to expand its northern frontier in New Spain and likely was
intended as a part of a chain of settlements between San Antonio and Santa Fe. The
presidio also was built to protect nearby Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá. Spain’s plan
for northward expansion was dramatically halted on March 16, 1758, when a coalition of
Wichita, Comanche, and various Caddoan groups, known as Norteños, burned the
mission and killed a number of mission residents, including two priests. The mission
effort there was abandoned, but the presidio remained in use until 1770 when it was
relocated to the Rio Grande.
A number of historical documents relating to the presidio survive, including three
contemporary plan maps of the fortifications. Interestingly, these three plan maps differ
in a number of ways, including the shape of the southeast bastion.
Archaeological investigations by Texas Tech University and the Texas
Archeological Society have uncovered large portions of the presidio foundations
including the entire southeast bastion. This thesis uses a middle-range approach to
examine the archaeological and documentary evidence to determine the accuracy of the
maps and other historical sources concerning the southeast bastion. A construction
sequence for the structure is also proposed, while the bastion’s appearance in its final
form is addressed. Analysis of the artifacts found within the bastion aid in understanding
of life within the bastion for soldiers on duty. The effectiveness of the bastion as a

vi

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

defensive structure based on the archaeological and documentary evidence is also
examined.
In this case, it is only through a critical analysis of the archaeological and
documentary data that a fuller understanding of the form and function of the southeast
bastion at San Sabá is obtained. Information obtained from this study can help to
illuminate one aspect of life on the military frontier of eighteenth-century Texas.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION

…certainly in its fortification-being built with stone-it resembles a castle
and dominates the entire presidio which it can easily defend…when
completed, his Majesty will have here the strongest presidio known in
these lands. [Felipé Rábago y Terán to the Marqués de Cruillas,
November 6, 1761 (Wolf 2005:53)]

It is in the form of a square 52 toesas in length and is badly constructed.
It has two bastions that are ill aligned with their opposed angles, and a
stone wall two toesas in height. This is a fortification that is as barbarous
as the enemy who attacks it. [Excerpt from the diary of the Marqués de
Rubí, 1767 (Jackson and Foster 1995:114)]

These two contradictory statements concerning the architecture of Presidio San
Sabá illuminate the difficulties of relying solely on historical documents for information
about the past. Which statement is more accurate? Historical archaeology, in many
cases, can clarify such ambiguities. This thesis will demonstrate the value of archaeology
in the analysis of historical records such as architectural plan maps and descriptions of
historical sites, using the southeastern defensive baluarte (hereafter referred to as a
“bastion” for convenience) of Presidio San Sabá (41MN1), an eighteenth-century Spanish
fortification near Menard, Texas, as a case study (Figures 1 and 2). An analysis of
documentary and archaeological data will delineate the size and shape of the southeast
bastion, propose a possible construction sequence, and evaluate the bastion’s function
and effectiveness as a defensive structure.

Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas, better known as Presidio San Sabá, was
established in 1757 in order to protect Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá, a mission to the
Lipán Apache along the Rio de San Sabá, established the same year (Dunn 1914; Weddle
1999; Wade 2003). Clearly, Presidio San Sabá was also intended to serve an offensive
purpose, judging from the size of its garrison and its location on the northernmost edge of
the Spanish frontier (Serrano Álvarez and Kuethe 2007). In fact, Serrano Álvarez and
Kuethe (2007:8) argue that, “…the military objective during the operations at San Sabá
should be understood as primary.” As originally constructed, the presidio fortifications
consisted of a crude wooden stockade with four adobe bastions, one at each corner (Wolf
2005). The mission was destroyed less than a year later by an alliance of various
Wichita, Caddoan, and Comanche groups, known collectively to the Spanish as the
Norteños, in order to punish the Spanish for their perceived alliance with their ancestral
enemy, the Lipán (Barr 2007; Wade 2003) (for archaeological investigations concerning
Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá, see Hindes et al. 1995; McWilliams 2001; and
3

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

McWilliams and Boyd 2008). Following this event and a punitive expedition against the
Norteños along the Red River in 1759, the Spanish gave up the San Sabá mission venture
but decided to keep the presidio in the region to serve as a buffer between the Norteños,
especially the Comanche, and the Spanish settlement of San Antonio de Béxar (Weddle
1999; Weddle 2007). Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla, commander of the presidio and leader
of the punitive expedition, was relieved of his command and replaced by Captain Felipe
de Rábago y Terán, who took full command of the garrison by 1761. (For more
information on the life of this infamous commander before and after his time at San Sabá,
see Chipman and Joseph 1999, Chipman and López Elizondo 2007, and Weddle 2007).
Shortly after his arrival at San Sabá, Rábago commenced a reconstruction of the presidio,
again with a wooden stockade, but this time with two bastions, in the northwest and
southeast corners. A few months later, Rábago initiated the conversion of the wooden
fortification to one of stone (Wolf 2005).
In 1766-1767 the Marqués de Rubí began an inspection tour of the interior
presidios (Jackson 1998). As part of the tour, Rubí took engineer, Nicolas de Lafora, a
member of the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers, and draftsman Joseph de Urrutia, a
member of the Royal Regiment of America, in order to produce plan maps of each
presidio and then to create an accurate map of the northern frontier of New Spain
(Fireman 1977; Jackson and Foster 1995). The documents produced by the Rubí
inspection tour provide a wealth of source material for historians and archaeologists
alike. The presidio site was abandoned in 1768 when the garrison moved to Mission San
Lorenzo without approval from the Viceroy (Rábago to the Marqués de Croix, July 20,
1768). Rábago kept the garrison at San Lorenzo until 1769 when he was relieved of his
4

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

command and replaced by Manuel Antonio de Oca, who briefly reoccupied San Sabá but
himself abandoned the site in 1770, again returning to San Lorenzo (Weddle 1999). Oca
was removed from command of the garrison and replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Hugo
O’Conor. Before O’Conor could take command, he was promoted to CommandantInspector of the Interior Provinces (Cutter 1994; Vigness 1967). The garrison was later
transferred to Villa de San Fernando de Austria in Coahuila, where it remained until 1773
when it was transferred to the San Vicente pass on the Rio Grande (just south of presentday Big Bend National Park) where it remained until the garrison was disbanded in 1782
(Cutter 1994; Ivey 1990). San Sabá, at its Menard location, was reoccupied several more
times by other Spanish forces, Native Americans, and early Anglo settlers to the area, and
modifications were likely made to the structures as needed. The fortifications apparently
fell into ruins by the early nineteenth century (Weddle 1999).
The Texas Centennial Commission began a partial reconstruction of the Presidio
San Sabá in 1936 and completed it in 1937. However, only the northwest portion of the
fort was reconstructed, and not all of the walls follow the original wall foundations. The
reconstructed structure fell into disrepair soon after it was built, and the ruins remain at
the site today (Walter et al. 2005). In the 1960’s a golf course was created over a portion
of the site, including a road, golf cart paths, and a sprinkler system, causing considerable
damage to the site.
Dr. Kathleen Gilmore and Dessamae Lorrain conducted the first archaeological
investigations at San Sabá in 1967. The work consisted of a pedestrian reconnaissance
and two test excavations, one along the south wall and the other in the center of a room
along the west wall. Only the south wall excavation exposed architectural remains
5

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

consisting of a segment of the wall (Gilmore 1967). In 1981 James Ivey conducted an
intensive pedestrian survey and produced the first measured archaeological plan map of
the presidio ruins (Figure 3). Ivey mapped the 1937 reconstruction as it stood and then
measured the remains of the original wall foundations, visible as low mounds on the
surface, and mapped them in place. Based on his investigations and the Lafora map, Ivey
also drew a virtual reconstruction of the structure as it might have looked in 1767 (Ivey
1981).

Figure 3: Plan view of remains of Presidio San Sabá as
mapped by Ivey (1981:5).

Beginning in 2000, the Texas Tech University Archaeological Field School, under
the direction of Dr. Tamra L. Walter and Dr. Grant D. Hall, has conducted intensive
archaeological investigations at Presidio San Sabá. Members of the Texas Archeological
Society (TAS), in conjunction with the Texas Tech field school, have also conducted
additional excavations during the summers of 2003, 2004, and 2007. In November 2004,
6

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

a remote sensing survey was conducted on portions of the presidio ruins, which included
both ground-penetrating radar (GPR) (Figure 4) and magnetometer surveys by Tiffany
Osburn, Dr. James Bruseth and William Pierson from the Texas Historical Commission
(Osburn 2004).

Figure 4: GPR image (from Osburn 2004).

Although historians have written much about Presidio San Sabá, many of the
descriptions of the architecture are based on documentary sources that either were not
critically analyzed or were published prior to archaeological work at the site.
Unfortunately, many researchers make assumptions that maps and other documents are
accurate representations of the reality of the period. One must take into account the
social and political context in which the document was produced. For example, plan
maps should not be used by archaeologists only to confirm excavation results or fill in
7

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

missing details. Ideally, the plan maps and descriptions should be critically assessed and
compared with the archaeological record. Such maps can be a powerful source of
information if they are treated as independent from the archaeological data and the
differences are exposed (Pickles 2004; Smith 2002). Hence, a middle-range theoretical
approach which makes use of both documentary and archaeological data is particularly
appropriate for this study. More specifically, the southeast bastion provides an excellent
case study because of the contradictory documentary evidence as to its shape and
appearance. The plan map drawn by Rábago in 1764 differs dramatically from those
drawn by both Lafora and Urrutia in 1767. Archaeology, in this case, provides the only
means of confirming what was actually built.
A prevalent theoretical framework used by many archaeologists is known as
middle-range theory. Originally developed for prehistoric studies, archaeologist Lewis
Binford proposed this theory as a means of analyzing two parallel sets of data,
ethnographic and archaeological (Binford 1987). Historical archaeologist Mark Leone
modified Binford’s approach for historical archaeologists by replacing ethnographic data
with documentary evidence. Leone considered documentary evidence and archaeological
data to be separate and independent (Leone and Crosby 1987; Leone 1988). Thus, the
two data sets can be either complimentary or contradictory, usually some of both.
Differences identified between the data sets form questions for further research, and
contribute to a more complete understanding of both data sets.
This thesis will compare documentary data, in this case period Spanish plan maps,
along with accompanying descriptions of the southeast bastion, with what was discovered
through archaeological means. The plans analyzed include a map by Felipe Rábago y

Terán and the Joseph de Urrutia and Nicolas de Lafora plans. The archaeological data
include pedestrian reconnaissance results, remote sensing data, and excavation results.
The entire bastion was excavated under the supervision of Walter during investigations in
July of 2005, during the 2006 Texas Tech University Archaeological Field School, and
the 2007 Texas Archeological Society Field School, with the author serving as area
supervisor during all three excavation seasons. The artifacts and architectural remains
from within the bastion are analyzed, and these data along with the documentary
evidence are used to address the following research questions:
1. Which plan map is a more accurate representation of the southeast bastion?
2. What was the construction sequence of this bastion?
3. What did the bastion look like in its final form?
4. What was life like for the soldiers on duty within the bastion?
5. How effective was the bastion as a defensive structure?
Chapter 2 discusses the theoretical framework chosen for this thesis. In order to
place the presidio within the broader context of frontier fortifications of northern New
Spain, Chapter 3 provides a historical background. Chapter 4 presents a discussion of the
methods used in the documentary and archaeological research in order to highlight the
differences between the two data sets. Chapter 5 analyzes the results of the documentary
research, while Chapter 6 presents the results of the archaeological investigation.
Chapter 7 synthesizes the documentary and archaeological results and provides a
conclusion that addresses the research questions that guided this thesis.

CHAPTER II
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
This study employs a middle-range theoretical framework. Historical
archaeologists Mark Leone and Constance Crosby (1987) modified Binford’s approach
for historical archaeology by substituting documentary evidence for ethnographic data.
Historical archaeologists routinely work with both data sets, but often the historical
documents are used merely for interpretation or for locating features. Leone and Crosby
(1987:399) argue that archaeologists need:
…to see the written documents and archaeologically recovered materials from
one culture, and even one site, as epistemologically separate. The data were made
by different individuals, at different times, for different purposes. For one set of
data—the documents—to understand an independent set of data—the material
remains—requires a better method than we possess, for as it now stands, either an
object is identified through a record, or is used to verify the record. In neither
case is the assumption of identity valid, with very few exceptions.
Since the two data sets were produced for different purposes by different people, each
should be examined independently. In this way the differences, or ambiguities, are
isolated. These ambiguities should not be dismissed as exceptions, as Binford points out,
but should serve as springboards for further questioning and research (Binford 1987).
Thus, understanding of both the documentary and archaeological data is increased.
Another aspect of middle-range theory is that of “organizational behaviors” which
produced the ethnographic, the documentary, and the archaeological records (Binford
1987; Leone and Crosby 1987; Leone and Potter 1988; Potter 1992). Organizational
behaviors, in terms of historical archaeology, are used “to ascribe meaning to the
ambiguities discovered through careful description and comparison,” (Leone and Potter
1988: 14), and refers to those behaviors that are associated with the production of the
10

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

documentary and archaeological record. The behaviors that led to the deposit of artifacts
and construction of structures found in the southeast bastion are contrasted with the
behaviors which created the descriptions and maps that form the documentary record of
the bastion. The discrepancies between the two data sets are the subject of this study. As
Parker Potter, Jr. points out, archaeologists need to remember that the documentary
record was not produced for them. Researchers should attempt to understand the
documentary record “…on its own terms, rather than in terms of how well it seems to
serve our archaeological needs” (Potter 1992:10).
Since the 1990s, there seems to be a move away from the use of the term “middlerange theory,” yet much of its language remains. For example, in a chapter in an edited
volume published in 2006, Patricia Galloway writes, “I will suggest that dissonances
between the material and textual evidence produced by archaeologists and historians
must first be recognized as arising from the separate production processes for the two
forms of evidence” (2006:43). Laurie A. Wilkie writes similar statements in her chapter
in another edited volume on historical archaeology. Wilkie states that documentary and
archaeological sources are, “additional windows [which] may provide overlapping,
conflicting, or entirely different insights into the past. The challenge for archaeologists is
to use these independent but complementary lines of evidence to construct meaningful,
fuller understandings of the past” (2006:14). This thesis follows the same paradigm of
treating the two lines of evidence, documentary and archaeological, as separate and
independent, evaluating each on its own merit and examining the contexts in which the
documents were produced and the archaeological record was created. Once both sets of
data are evaluated, a synthesis of both is attempted. By contrasting the results of
11

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

documentary research with the archaeological record, ambiguities between the two are
highlighted. Comparing the two data sets in this manner enables specific issues to be
singled out for more analysis.
The documentary evidence used consists of letters, reports, diaries, and historical
plan maps produced by military officers and travelers whose descriptions are important to
archaeologists and historians alike, although each may approach the documents
differently. The archaeological data for the southeast bastion at Presidio San Sabá consist
of the results of pedestrian reconnaissance, remote sensing, and excavation over three
field seasons.
The importance of period maps to historical archaeological research cannot be
overstated. However, many archaeologists and historians do not critically evaluate these
sources. Maps are typically used to help locate archaeological sites (Orser 2004), or in
the case of a site such as Presidio San Sabá, whose location has long been known, to help
interpret the remaining architecture of the site, and possibly to determine the form and
function of the structures (Walter et al. 2005). Importantly, it must be remembered that
period maps, like other documents, reflect the culture that produced them and are subject
to the social and political atmosphere in which they were conceived (Pickles 2004; Smith
2002).
For example, in the case of the eighteenth-century plan maps of Presidio San
Sabá, the most accurate maps are thought to be those produced in 1767 by a trained
military engineer, Nicolas de Lafora, and a military draftsman, Joseph de Urrutia.
Therefore, these maps are considered by some historians to be the final word as to the
form of the fortification (Moorhead 1975; Weddle 1999). However, the context in which
12

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

the maps were produced is important to note. Lafora and Urrutia were under orders, and
both followed certain standard conventions of military architectural illustration (Jackson
1998; Reinhartz and Saxon 2005; Robinson 1977). A critical assessment of these
documents is needed in order to understand the differences between the two maps and the
archaeological record. For example, key questions that need to be addressed include:
What items were not included on the maps? Were the items that were included
technically accurate? Why were there noticeable differences between the Lafora and the
Urrutia maps if both visited the site at the same time? What was the agenda behind the
creation of the maps? Finally, what was the agenda of the inspection tour itself? As
Smith (2002:327) states in regard to historic maps:
The implications are significant, for the map has become a document more real
than the reality of what it is trying to represent. What is on the map “exists”, what
is not on the map does not; what is named on the map is significant, what is not
named is unimportant to the mapmakers and consequently to the map readers.
Every line, colour shading and symbol on the map is chosen to represent some
specific feature of the world….Seeing is a cultural act, contingent on one’s
cultural perspectives within the complex web of social interactions,
understanding, and meanings of place and identity.
The architecture of Presidio San Sabá is well documented, but current and future research
should also make use of the archaeological data using the above-described middle-range
approach. Only through a critical examination of both the documentary and
archaeological data does a clear image of the southeast bastion at San Sabá begin to
emerge. The documentary evidence from maps and descriptions alone is not sufficient to
convey the reality of the construction.
In order to set the defenses at San Sabá, including the southeast bastion, into
proper context, Chapter 3 provides an introduction to the military architecture found on
New Spain’s northern frontier. A general survey of presidio architecture from the
13

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries is presented as well as an examination of
vernacular fortified ranch construction, which, arguably, had more of an influence on the
architecture of San Sabá than did the conventions of formal eighteenth-century presidio
construction.

CHAPTER III
BACKGROUND
A Brief Introduction to Presidio Architecture in Northern New Spain
Two of the institutions of the Spanish colonial system, missions and settlements,
have received considerable attention from historical archaeologists. However, presidios
have only recently received attention in mainstream historical archaeology (Bense 2004).
The following includes a brief introduction to presidio architecture in Northern New
Spain using historical and archaeological research. The focus is primarily on the interior
presidios, although the coastal presidios of California and Florida will also be discussed
briefly. Additional attention is paid to the architecture of eighteenth-century Texas
presidios before and after the Reglamento of 1772, which attempted to standardize
presidio design (Brinkerhoff and Faulk 1965). A discussion of vernacular fortified ranch
architecture and its influence on San Sabá is also presented.
The word “presidio” derives from the Latin praesidium, a term that describes a
frontier garrison and outpost. The Romans had such outposts in virtually all parts of their
empire, although, interestingly, the term “presidio” does not seem to have been used in
Spain. Fortifications in Spain were known variously as castillos (“little camps”),
fortelezas, and fuertes (“strongholds”) (Moorhead 1975; Naylor and Polzer 1986;
Williams 2004). Only after the Reconquista (the reconquest of Spain from the Moors)
was complete did the word “presidio” come into use in Spain, describing frontier
garrisons in Morocco and on the early frontiers of sixteenth-century northern Mexico
(Naylor and Polzer 1986; Powell 1982).

15

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

In order to consolidate and settle the frontiers of their empire, the Spanish
implemented three institutions: the presidio, the mission, and the civilian settlement
(Bolton 1979). Some historians also add a fourth institution, the ranch (see Jackson
1986; Myers 1979). San Sabá was originally one such mission/presidio complex. Of
these institutions, the presidio was the key to the success of the others. Without the
garrisons of soldiers to protect them, the missions and settlements were doomed to
failure. The Spanish crown spent huge sums of money on these frontier outposts,
including San Sabá (Navarro Garcia 1967; Serrano Álvarez and Kuethe 2008). Despite
this monetary outlay, the military effectiveness of these frontier presidios is questioned:
As a weapon of defense, it was a fortress; as an offensive weapon, it all too often
was a farce. Yet considering the shortage of supplies and funds, the paucity of
support from higher echelons of government, the poor training of the soldiers, and
the barbaric ferocity of the natives, the wonder is not that the presidio largely
failed in its military objectives as a frontier institution but that it succeeded as
well as it did. [Faulk 1979:74]
While their military success is questionable, the true success of these frontier garrisons
lies in the fact that many major cities originated around and still bear the place names of
these presidios: San Antonio, San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, Monterey, Santa
Fe, and Tucson, to name a few (Ivey 2008).
As a colonial institution of northern New Spain, the earliest use of the word
“presidio” was during the Chichimeca War of 1550-1590. When silver was discovered in
the Zacatecas region of north central Mexico in 1546, miners and prospectors from all
over Mexico flocked to the area. Eventually, these new arrivals encroached upon
Chichimeca land, resulting in a bloody conflict. In an effort to protect themselves from
attack along the roads to Zacatecan mines, workers built fortified houses along the routes
called casas fuertes (“fortified houses”) (Naylor and Polzer 1986; Powell 1982), even
16

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

constructing fortified wagons for protection. In 1569, the first true presidios were built in
the region. Many of these early presidios employed architectural features that continued
to be found on presidios throughout northern New Spain for the next 200 years. These
fortifications featured “four walls enclosing an interior quadrangle with bastions or
battlements at two or more corners,” allowing for “living quarters for the occupants,
storage and repair areas, stables, offices, chapel, and an exercise and parade grounds—all
protected within the perimeter of buildings and walls” (Naylor and Polzer 1986:36). A
1576 drawing of the Presidio de Jalpa reproduced in Navarro Garcia (1964) illustrates
this design very well (Figure 5).

Figure 5: The Presidio de Jalpa, 1576 (from Navarro Garcia, 1964:
plate 1).

By 1590 the war with the Chichimeca had ended, and the Spanish began an effort
to settle Gran Chichimeca, creating missions and settlements, as well as presidios. This
method of colonization became the standard for all of northern New Spain. Presidios as
defensive and strategic institutions became a widespread phenomenon (Powell 1982).

17

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

The institution of presidios spread northward as Spain claimed more and more
territory, stretching from California in the west to La Florida in the east. Presidio
architecture varied widely, however. Each presidial captain was given the freedom to
choose the location and layout of his presidio (Williams 2004). Nevertheless, it should
be noted that there are three distinct architectural types of presidios: coastal, urban, and
interior.
Designed to face a European enemy, coastal or maritime presidios tended to be
more heavily fortified than interior presidios. The California and Florida presidios
exemplified this type. These fortifications ranged from square, diamond, or star-shaped
structures with the most heavily-fortified areas facing the coast to protect them from sea
attacks (Childers 2004; Early 2004). The exceptionally well-built Castillo de San Marcos
in Saint Augustine, Florida, provides an excellent example of a heavily-fortified coastal
presidio. The Castillo was constructed over a 23-year period, from 1672 to 1695 and
experienced other modifications until well into the eighteenth century (Childers 2004;
Early 2004; Halbirt 2004) (Figure 6). The configuration of San Marcos is that of a square
with a large angular bastion at each corner (Early 2004). A good example of a coastal
presidio in Texas is Presidio La Bahía in its original location at Matagorda Bay. Built in
1722, it featured an elaborate 16-point star design (Figure 7). The presidio was located
on the site of what was once the French Fort St. Louis. La Bahía was aligned to magnetic
north and featured a wooden palisade wall and several jacal structures (Bruseth et al.
2004). Jacal, or wattle and daub, construction was a common building technique in
frontier areas. In this type of construction wooden poles were set upright into the ground,
often in a builders’ trench, and interlaced with sticks or brush to form walls. A coating of
18

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

clay-rich mud was then applied to both the interior and exterior surfaces. Most jacal
buildings had thatched roofs (Fox 1990; Manucy 1992).

19

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Urban presidios were typically found near the heart of Spanish settlements in
northern New Spain. Established within Spanish towns or communities, these garrisons
were usually unfortified and formed a plaza surrounded by captain’s quarters, barracks,
arsenals, and storehouses. A chapel was frequently present, either among the presidio
buildings or in the immediate vicinity (Early 2004; Moorhead 1975). In Texas, Presidio
San Antonio de Béjar represents an urban-style presidio that conformed to this pattern
(Figure 8). Founded in 1719, Presidio San Antonio was one of the most important in
Texas, protecting the five missions in San Antonio and eventually serving as the
provincial capital (Ivey 2004).

Urrutia (from Jackson and Foster 1995:plate 4) (a: Barracks;

e: Government Buildings; f: Church).

20

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Interior presidios, those built along the northern frontier of New Spain, were
much less elaborate than their coastal counterparts. While coastal presidios were
designed to defend against European land and naval forces, interior presidios defended
against a different enemy, the Native Americans (Barteet 2000; Moorhead 1975;
Williams 2004). Initially these presidios were not built within Spanish towns, although
sometimes towns later grew up around them. The interior forts were frequently made of
adobe, but they could be constructed of wood, jacal, or stone, depending on nearby
resources. The basic form was similar to the presidios found along the Chichimeca
frontier, consisting of a square or rectangular shape with bastions on opposing corners
(Spanish documentary sources use baluarte, or bulwark, torreon, or tower, somewhat
interchangeably to refer to projecting corner defenses. This thesis will use the term
“bastion” to avoid confusion). Many, however, had no fortifications and were simply an
arrangement of officers’ quarters, barracks, storerooms, and a chapel (Barteet 2000;
Moorhead 1975; Williams 2004). Presidio San Sabá is one of the many interior forts
built along the Spanish frontier of Texas.
Archaeologists are beginning to focus increasingly on these presidios and are
aided by historical maps and descriptions produced by the Spanish. Perhaps the bestknown Spanish engineer of the eighteenth century was Nicolas de Lafora, who
accompanied the Marqués de Rubí on an inspection tour of the presidios of northern New
Spain in 1766 and 1767 (Jackson and Foster 1995; Lafora, Report to the Marqués de
Rubí, August 12, 1767; Williams 2004). Lafora kept a diary of his journey, as did Rubí,
and gave detailed descriptions of 21 presidios. Apparently, Lafora personally mapped the
layouts of only two presidios, Guajoquilla and San Sabá, recommending that each be
21

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

abandoned (Fireman 1977; Jackson and Foster 1995; Lafora, Report to the Marqués de
Rubí, August 12, 1767). Also accompanying this expedition was Joseph de Urrutia, a
draftsman who produced detailed maps of all 21 presidios. Urrutia was trained as an
engineer and did most of the measuring and mapping for the expedition (Fireman 1977;
Jackson 1998). Many of his maps included a section elevation (profile) of one wall of the
fortifications, giving researchers a more detailed view of the architecture. Today, all 21
of Urrutia’s maps are housed in the British Library in London. Lafora’s map of Presidio
San Sabá is found in the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, Spain.
Following the Rubí expedition, King Charles III issued the Reglamento of 1772,
based in large part on Rubí’s recommendations (Jackson 1998). The complete text of the
Reglamento is reproduced in both Spanish and English in Brinkerhoff and Faulk’s (1965)
Lancers for the King: A Study of the Frontier Military System of Northern New Spain,
with a Translation of the Royal Regulations of 1772. The Reglamento made sweeping
changes in the locations and designs of the frontier presidios. In part, it called for the
creation of a cordon of presidios stretching from the Gulf of California to the Gulf of
Mexico (Brinkerhoff and Faulk 1965; Williams 2004). Only the presidios of Santa Fe
and San Antonio would be kept north of this line. In Texas, Presidio San Sabá would be
relocated along the Rio Grande. The Reglamento also attempted to standardize presidio
design.
Interestingly, the design of these new presidios still lagged behind fortification
design in Europe (Barteet 2000; Moorhead 1975; Williams 2004). In general, presidios
were rectangular in shape with bastions on two opposing angles. Bastions were diamondshaped as opposed to the round towers, or torreones, found at many older presidios.
22

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

These angular bastions were thought to provide better flanking angles along the walls
(Barteet 2000). The entire structure was typically constructed from adobe, and within the
walls, a captain’s quarters, barracks, guardhouses, and chapels were erected (Brinkerhoff
and Faulk 1965). The most comprehensive archaeological survey of these postReglamento presidios published so far is that of Rex Gerald in 1968. Gerald (1968)
provides data on nine presidios in Arizona, northern Mexico, and Texas, including plans
for seven of these presidios from his own field measurements. As mapped by Gerald
(1968) and Ivey (1990), Presidio San Carlos serves as an example of these postReglamento presidios (Figure 9). In contrast, European fortifications of the eighteenth
century followed the much more complex design of engineers such as de Gomme and
Vauban (Duffy 2006; Saunders 2004). Often pentagonal with intricate outworks, these
fortifications were obviously designed to defend against artillery sieges by other
European powers (Figure 10).

showing typical post-1772 presidio design.

23

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Figure 10: Citadel at Lille designed and built by Vauban
and later drawn by Mueller in 1746 (Griffith 2006:40).

While the effectiveness of presidios is debated, their role in the settlement of
northern New Spain cannot be denied (Faulk 1971; Faulk 1979; Williams 2004).
Currently, presidio research is expanding among historical archaeologists and historians
in the Southwest and Florida (Bense 2004).
As exemplified in this thesis, the architecture of Presidio San Sabá has more in
common with frontier fortified ranch architecture than the more formal European-style
fortifications of the post-1772 presidios. San Sabá’s architecture fits more closely with
vernacular tradition than the more formal, academic tradition. Deetz (1996:126) states,
“[v]ernacular building is folk building, done without benefit of formal plans. Such
structures are frequently built by their occupants or, if not, by someone who is well
within the occupants’ immediate community.” On the other hand, “[a]cademic
architecture proceeds from plans created by architects trained in the trade and reflects
contemporary styles of design that relate to formal architectural orders” (Deetz
24

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

1996:126). The fortifications of San Sabá were of the vernacular tradition in that the
buildings were constructed by the soldiers themselves (Wolf 2005). Since it is assumed
that most of the soldiers at San Sabá had grown up on the frontiers of northern New
Spain, vernacular fortified ranch construction was certainly familiar to the garrison.
These ranch structures usually featured thick walls with few or no windows and flat roofs
with raised parapets for defense. Often the only openings in such structures were a single
door and troneras, or gun ports (Fleming 1998; George 1975). Frontier ranches were
frequently protected by torreones, or towers, and sometimes by defensive walls
surrounding an open plaza forming a small fortress-like compound (Cargill et al. 1998,
Fleming 1998, George 1975, Ivey 1983, Jackson 1986). Similar features were noted
archaeologically at Rancho de las Cabras (41WN30) near Floresville, Texas (Cargill et al.
1998, Ivey 1983) (Figure 11). Fortifications like these, which closely resemble those of
frontier presidios, were often found at missions as well (Early 2004).

CHAPTER IV
METHODS
Documentary Research
The following describes the methods used for both the documentary and
archaeological research. After an exhaustive study of the secondary literature on the San
Sabá mission/presidio complex was completed, a documentary search for items relating
to the layout and construction of the presidio’s fortifications was conducted. The
documents found include maps, descriptions, letters, and military reports, many of which
appear in translation in secondary works. Where translated documents were used, every
effort was made to cross-check key and obscure passages against the original Spanish.
Two separate trips to Spanish archives held in the Center for American History (CAH) at
The University of Texas at Austin (UT) revealed several useful documents. Several
boxes of photostat copies of documents from the Archivo General de la Nacion in
Mexico (AGN) the Archivo de San Francisco el Grande (ASFG) and the Archivo General
de Indias in Seville, Spain (AGI) were examined and photocopied for this thesis. The
documents were first photocopied or, in some cases, transcribed by Herbert E. Bolton,
William E. Dunn, and Carlos E. Castañeda in the first third of the twentieth century. A
visit to the Catholic Archives of Texas in Austin (CAT) yielded a typed transcript of a
testimony by Coronel Don Diego Ortiz Parrilla concerning the construction of Presidio
San Sabá dated 1763 and obtained by William E. Dunn. Following a research trip to the
AGI in Seville, Dr. Allan J. Kuethe generously provided photocopies of additional
original manuscripts generated by the Marqués de Rubí inspection tour of 1767. These
items, written by both Rubí and Lafora, relate to the construction of the stone
26

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

fortifications of Presidio San Sabá. Passages from these photocopies of Spanish
manuscripts were transcribed and translated by the author with the aid of a Spanish
dictionary and Northern New Spain: A Research Guide (Barnes et al. 1981), and
Antologia de paleografia y diplomatica (Texto I) (Bibriesca Sumano 1991) which contain
many of the common abbreviations used in eighteenth-century Spanish manuscripts, as
well as other paleographic aids. The same translation process was also applied to
photostat copies of manuscript letters and a report by Rábago (ASFG Box 2Q254,
Volume 20) found at the Center for American History at the University of Texas in
Austin.
The manuscript plan maps which were crucial to this research came from three
different sources. Rábago’s 1764 plan was found among the photostat copies of the
ASFG (Box 2Q254, Volume 20, #18). A visit to the British Library in London enabled a
study of the original 1767 plan drawn by Joseph de Urrutia as part of the Rubí inspection
tour (Add. Ms. 17662 r). A microform copy of the Nicolas de Lafora plan, also drawn in
1767 as part of the same expedition, was provided by Dr. Allan J. Kuethe from the AGI
in Seville. Dr. G. Douglass Inglis also obtained a digital scan of the detail of the San
Sabá enclosure from the AGI.
Archaeological Research
Texas Tech University began work at Presidio San Sabá in 2000 under the
direction of Walter and Hall. A vertical datum was established on the northeast corner of
a granite monument in the northwest portion of the presidio amid the 1936 reconstruction
(Figure 3). The elevation was set at an arbitrary 100.00 meters (Walter et al. 2003). All
unit subdatums, placed adjacent to each excavation unit for vertical provenience, are
27

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

established using this baseline. A primary horizontal datum was established in the northcentral portion of the site and set at N1000, E1000 and was marked with a 3.25-inch
aluminum cap set in concrete. Four subsequent horizontal datums were placed and
marked in a similar manner. Using the primary horizontal datum as a baseline, a grid was
established. Between 2003 and 2007, most excavation units were placed within the grid
system with the exception of the recent excavations in the southeast bastion. The bastion
excavations were intentionally aligned with visible architectural features.
Work near the southeast bastion began during the TAS Field School in June 2004.
Specifically, two 2-x-2-meter units were placed near the entrance to the structure. In
November of 2004, a Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey was conducted over a
large portion of the south wall of the presidio, including the southeast bastion. A number
of anomalies were noted, contradicting both the Lafora and Urrutia plan maps (Osburn
2004). These discrepancies underscored the need for additional archaeological research
in order to define the actual form of the bastion. Volunteer members of the TTU
archeological laboratory methods class conducted testing in the bastion area during a oneweek trip to the presidio under the direction of Walter in July of 2005. Based on the GPR
findings as well as visible surface stones, four 2-x-2 meter units were placed in the
bastion area and were excavated, using 10-centimeter arbitrary levels, to the colonial
deposits. All matrix was screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth.
Encouraged by the results of this testing, the southeast bastion was a primary
focus of the 2006 TTU Archaeological Field School. Ten new 2-x-2 meter units were
excavated and two 2005 units were reopened during the June field season. The following
year, the remainder of the bastion area was examined during the 2007 TAS Annual Field
28

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

School. A total of 18 2-x-2 meter units were excavated, and all previous seasons’ units
were reopened during the week-long field school. In all, 116 square meters of the bastion
area were exposed, and approximately 42 cubic meters of soil were excavated.
Units opened during the 2005-2007 field seasons were excavated in 10-centimeter
arbitrary levels, and all matrix was screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth. Artifacts
collected from each level were bagged and labeled separately and taken to the TTU
Archaeological Laboratory for further examination. Artifacts found in situ were recorded
and mapped on the corresponding level form and bagged and labeled separately. Each
excavation crew kept detailed field records, produced maps of each level, and drew
profiles of at least one wall of each completed unit where useful. All features were noted
on related unit level forms and then recorded on separate feature forms. In addition,
excavators were encouraged to keep a daily field journal that was turned in at the end of
the field season. Digital and 35- mm photographs were taken at all stages of excavation
and recorded on a photographic log.
In the lab, all artifact bags were assigned lot numbers corresponding to excavation
levels. All artifacts were then washed, dried, sorted into categories, and analyzed by
students from the TTU archaeology lab classes, the author, or volunteers and recorded on
the appropriate forms. Building materials and bone were weighed only, while shell and
glass were both counted and weighed. Ceramics, metal, and lithic artifacts received more
in-depth analysis. Ceramics were weighed, measured by thickness, described by surface
color and treatment, and the paste assigned a color based on the Munsell Soil Color chart.
Metal artifacts were measured, counted, weighed, and divided into categories based on
function. Lithic artifacts were divided into cores, debitage, tools, and gunflints. Tools
29

and gunflints were measured and weighed and use-wear was recorded. Cores were
measured and weighed, while debitage was counted and weighed.

CHAPTER V
RESULTS OF HISTORICAL AND DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH
This section presents the results of documentary research into the architecture and
construction of Presidio San Sabá. The earliest known documented references to the
architecture of the presidio are presented in a recent article by architect Mark R. Wolf in
the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society (2005). Wolf presents several translations
by historian David R. McDonald of Spanish documents taken from transcriptions of
items containing references to the architecture of the presidio. Wolf recently
rediscovered these items, transcriptions of manuscripts from the AGI, Seville and the
AGN, Mexico, in the CAH at UT in Austin (Wolf 2005). While Wolf’s article presents
the complete text of each of these documents, the present study utilizes only excerpts
dealing with the architecture and construction of San Sabá.
The first of these references presented by Wolf is from an auto, or report, to the
Viceroy by the interim commander at San Sabá, Capitan Manuel Rodriguez, dated
October 6, 1760. This report, written prior to the arrival of Rábago, reads in part: “The
construction of this presidio is composed of a surrounding stockade in the manner of
chamaqueros [fastened with rawhide straps], as they are called in these lands. It will not
last long, since the posts in the ground will rot and the houses will be ruined—as has
happened with two of them that have collapsed” (Wolf 2005:48). (See Figure 12 for
example of a jacal roof with chamaquero construction). Obviously Rodriguez was not
impressed with the strength of his temporary command.

Figure 12: Jacal roof, Nuevo Leon, Mexico (from George 1975:41); Note rawhide straps on left side of
image, indicated by black arrows.

Next is a certification by officers assigned to San Sabá in support of the new
commander, Rábago, addressed to the Viceroy, the Marqués de Cruillas, dated February
27, 1761:
…these little houses were all the security, force and rearguard that Colonel
Parrilla [sic] left, along with four adobe bastions which with the rains have been
ruined…The rest of the men work at enclosing the entire presidio with thick, tall
posts so that the little houses are within the stockade. They are building two
bastions—one a terraplein with palisades high and thick, the other is roofed and
serves as the major guard so as not to impede the handling of the cannons. It is
equally palisaded like the other bastion and in the same manner the [stockade] is
being put in circumference of the presidio….The captain bought eight yokes of
oxen in San Antonio with the desire to build the entire presidio with stone, but the
severity of winter did not permit further progress in the material construction of it.
[Wolf 2005:50]
Wolf (2005) points out that there were obviously two distinct wooden stockades
constructed at San Sabá, Parrilla’s original, hastily constructed chamaquero and
Rábago’s sturdy log replacement. The stone that Rábago intended to use for the planned
32

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

conversion from a wooden to a stone fortress was probably quarried from a limestone
outcrop just northwest of the presidio known to the Spanish as Loma de Piedras, or
“Rock Hill”, although this has not been confirmed by archaeological investigation
(Castañeda 1939:195). Rábago does mention in a report dated October 19, 1764 that
2700 cartloads of stone were quarried nearby for the construction of the presidio (ASFG
Box 2Q254, Vol. 20, No. 18, CAH). This statement refutes local Menard lore that the
stones were quarried across the river from the fort and floated on rafts down the acequia
and then upriver to the presidio.
In a letter by Rábago to the Marqués de Cruillas dated March 2, 1761, Rábago
himself describes, in finer detail, the construction of the second wooden fortification:
And at the same time [they are] strengthening [the presidio] as much as possible,
for [I found its] structure in such miserable condition, as your excellency can see
from the certification that accompanies the diligencias cited….For this reason I
have built two elevated bastions made of very thick wood. One has an
embankment [terreplein]; the other is roofed with room for many soldiers and
operation of many cannons. In the same manner I am equipping and fortifying
the entire presidio with a thick palisade that is not less than 8.3 feet in height not
counting 4.3 feet fixed in the ground. And the two bastions with six cannons
cover the entire presidio in any direction or purpose that may be needed. [Wolf
2005:51]
These details, if technically accurate, could prove useful to archaeologists. However, one
must cautiously examine such reports. Because Rábago was no doubt eager to impress
his superiors, he may have exaggerated.
In a letter, also addressed to the Marqués de Cruillas, dated November 6, 1761,
Rábago detailed the conversion from a wooden stockade to a stone fortress. Again he
may have exaggerated some statements:
In consideration of the indefensibility of this presidio in case of attack and the low
morale of the men, I initiated construction of the stockade about which I informed
Your Excellency on another occasion. I have proposed to the soldiers the
33

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

necessity of a strong-house [casa fuerte], in which all the men could be gathered
and be defended in case it should be necessary. And I began construction of it, to
the men’s enthusiasm, without regard to the cost (and it has not been cheap). At
the present it is being completed, and certainly in its fortification—being built
with stone—it resembles a castle and dominates the entire presidio which it can
easily defend….After the work is finished, which will be done this month, I have
proposed to the soldiers the construction of their houses in the convenient form,
which they will be making according to military duties. And in this manner the
[strong]-house has been built: when completed, His Majesty will have here the
strongest presidio known in these lands. As for what is my responsibility, I
assuage His Majesty with the large measure I have spent and will yet spend. [Wolf
2005:53]
Whether Rábago actually had permission to undertake such an expensive building project
is unclear. He may have overestimated the “enthusiasm” of the soldiers in building the
casa fuerte, which would later consist primarily of his home (Wolf 2005:53).
The earliest known graphic representation of the presidio was taken from a very
crude manuscript (hand-drawn) map drawn by an untrained, uneducated French deserter,
Pierre Tamoineau, better known to the Spanish as Pedro Tamamint. The Frenchman
made his way to San Sabá and joined the garrison there. When Rábago realized
Tamamint had seen the Norteño fortification on the Red River, the commander ordered
the map to be drawn. The map is not to scale and is more important for its representation
of the Norteño fortification than for its inaccurate representation of San Sabá (Barr 2007;
Jackson 1998; John 1992) (Figure 13). The next known copy of a plan map of Presidio
San Sabá is a manuscript copy of a plan view of the stone fortifications by Rábago, dated
1764 (CAH, UT, Box 2Q254, vol. 20, #18 ASFG) (Figure 14).

The Rubí inspection tour of 1766-1767 produced the next series of descriptions
and, just as importantly, the two measured plan maps generally considered to be the most
accurate graphic representations of the architecture at San Sabá. (For fuller treatment of
this inspection tour, see Brown 1924, Fireman 1977, Jackson 1998, Jackson and Foster
1995, Navarro Garcia 1964, Reinhartz and Saxon 2005, and Serrano Álvarez and Kuethe
2008). The Marqués de Rubí was ordered by the Viceroy to inspect the interior presidios,
describe and map them, and then to suggest needed reforms (Brown 1924). In order to
36

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

produce plan maps of each presidio and also to create an accurate map of the northern
frontier of New Spain, Rubí employed engineer Captain Lafora and draftsman Second
Lieutenant Urrutia (Fireman 1977; Jackson 1998; Jackson and Foster 1995; Reinhartz
and Saxon 2005).
Both Rubí and Lafora also kept detailed diaries of the trip that provide excellent
data for historians and archaeologists (Jackson and Foster 1995). A translation of Rubí’s
diary appears in the book Imaginary Kingdom: Texas as Seen by the Rivera and Rubí
Military Expeditions, 1727 and 1767 (Jackson and Foster 1995). There are two editions
of Lafora’s diary, one in Spanish, edited by Vito Alessio Robles in 1939, and the other in
English, translated and edited by Lawrence Kinnaird in 1958. Lafora’s diary and official
reports provide descriptions of the architecture of San Sabá, as do those of Rubí. Both
Lafora and Urrutia produced plan maps of the fortifications. The following is an excerpt
from the Rubí diary describing San Sabá:
The engineers found this presidio to be located at 31º 38’ latitude and 273º 27’
longitude. It is in the form of a square 52 toesas (a toesa is approximately
equivalent to 1.95 meters) in length and is badly constructed. It has two bastions
that are ill aligned with their opposed angles, and a stone wall 2 toesas in height.
This is a fortification that is as barbarous as the enemy who attacks it.
[Jackson and Foster 1995:114]
Rubí’s official report concerning San Sabá, translated in Wallace and Vigness (1960:20),
echoes the words of his diary:
Even a simple examination of the one map [Lafora] provokes one to think how far
this work is from the value of 26 (thousand) pesos which it cost as stated by the
captain in the proceedings…Its generous transfer to the king in his name and that
of the troops will always be useless to His Majesty regardless of whether he
abandons or maintains the presidio, because in the first circumstance there would
remain the represented 26 (thousand) pesos and in the second nothing will be
saved by that already done because of what he will need to spend to make a new
fortification according to scientific laws and principles.
37

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Lafora’s diary of the inspection tour was long thought to be the only source of
information for historians until Rubí’s diary surfaced (Jackson and Foster 1995). Due to
his training as a military engineer, Lafora provides detailed descriptions of the
fortifications as well as the surrounding flora and fauna. Concerning the architecture at
San Sabá he writes, “I also repeated my observations and found the place to be situated in
31º 38’ north latitude and 273 º 27’ longitude, reckoning from the Tenerife meridian. Its
shape and location are shown in detail on the map. For its defense there are seven small
cannon, four of them without trunnions, and all carriages are unserviceable” (Kinnaird
1958:151, Alessio Robles 1939:190-191).
A complete translation of Lafora’s evaluation of the fortification of San Sabá was
unavailable at the time of this writing. However, a rough, but detailed, paraphrased
translation of a letter to Rubí dated August 12, 1767, is contained in an unpublished
master’s thesis, The Military Defenses of Texas and The Rio Grande Region About 1766
(Brown 1924), and is also summarized by Moorhead (1975) and Ivey (1981). The
manuscript of Lafora’s letter was found in the Archivo General de Indias, Seville;
Audiencia de Guadalajara, Legajo 511. Lafora writes that the presidio:
…was between two bluffs and that the further one, which was on the north, was
not more than a gunshot away….The other precipice, which was the bank of the
San Sabá River, under cover of which the Indians crept up to the very walls was
even more dangerous. To remedy this inconvenience the residents of the presidio
had exposed themselves to another greater one by putting two ill-designed
parapets, X, Z, [On Lafora’s map of San Sabá] which provided lodging places for
the enemy and in them X might in all safety be averted the fire from the tower, P,
which was the chief defense of two adjacent fronts, and from Z communication by
the curtain wall in the angle T could be hindered; in this angle T could be barely
maintained a half dozen men protected by part of the parapet which in addition to
being built without mortar was so ill constructed that bullets passed through it as
through a sieve; at the same time they could stop the fire of the one front of the
tower R that flanked it and without this circumstance they could get to the front of
the wall under protection of the stockades of the corral Y. The walls were built of
38

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

eighteen inch logs and would considerably lessen the effectiveness of the lone
three inch gun, and would wholly nullify the fire of two or three men that could
be put in said flank, because it was so small as to hamper the artillerymen, which
was a considerable obstacle in preventing the opening of a gap and the admission
of Indians into the plaza…The poorly made embrasures, which were no more than
an opening from top to bottom in the parapet, left the artillery entirely exposed.
All parts of the walls between the bastions were without parapets and those of the
towers were low and ill-made. The place was much too low and far too easy to
get into from any direction. The tunnel Q, a fathom wide and of the same depth,
and improperly called a ditch, was as dangerous as the parapets in the breach,
because, as it was without defenses on every side, there would be a cover which,
because of its nearness, would allow the enemy to surround them when they came
up on that side to defend it. [Brown 1924:132-3] (Figure 15)

Figure 15: Nicolas de Lafora plan view of San Sabá redrawn for
clarity by Ivey (1981:9).

This very uncomplimentary report concerning the defenses of Presidio San Sabá
or, rather lack thereof, is further supported by Lafora’s plan map of the fortifications that
accompanied the above letter (Figure 16). For a translation of the explanation on
Lafora’s map see Ivey (1981). Note the section elevation, or profile, along the north wall
showing the casa fuerte, which included the captain’s house, a guardhouse, and a chapel,
39

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

and also the northwest bastion, which is in the form of a circular tower with cannon
embrasures in the parapet (Figure 17). This plan map, executed by a trained engineer,
can be quite helpful to archaeologists studying the physical remains of the fort if
examined critically in conjunction with the documentary evidence (Figure 18).

Urrutia, draftsman for the expedition, also produced a measured plan map with an
elevation along the north wall (Figure 19). For a translation of the explanation on
Urrutia’s map see Moorhead (1975). This map is very similar to Lafora’s with a major
difference, however, found in the southwest corner. Urrutia obviously impressed his
superiors while on the inspection tour, as he went on to have a distinguished military
career, attaining the rank of Captain General of the armies of Spain in 1795 (Jackson
1998) (Figure 20).

Francisco Goya, 1799.

Contextualizing Documents
As shown above, the documents produced by the Rubí inspection tour provide a
wealth of source material for historians and archaeologists alike. However, one needs to
keep in mind that Rubí, Lafora, and Urrutia were all military men acting upon orders
delivered by their superiors. The tour was only a small part of an empire-wide military
reform effort, and there was a definite agenda. (For military reforms in other parts of the
43

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

empire see the following examples: Archer 1977, Campbell 1978, Kuethe 1978, Kuethe
1986, and McAlister 1957). With regard to San Sabá, the Viceroy, the Marqués de
Cruillas, implied that the presidio was already slated for relocation in his orders to Rubí:
The presidio of San Sabá was founded between Texas and New Mexico for the
conquest of the Indians that were harassing the provinces of Coahuila and of
Vizcaya, and there is some reason for changing its location to the settlement
which the king has decided to make in the country of Cheta Manché of which
Don Antonio Ulloa, Governor of Louisiana, is in charge and the Marqués will be
careful to report what he may notice of the usefulness of this poblacion.
[Brown 1924:32]
The defects noted in the defensive architecture of the presidio were likely somewhat
exaggerated in order to support the Viceroy’s desire to relocate the garrison. The
presidio was finally abandoned in 1770 and the garrison transferred to the Rio Grande
(Weddle 1999). The abandoned ruins were reoccupied a few more times by the Spanish
military during the eighteenth century, and it is possible that modifications were made to
the structures as needed.
The fortifications apparently fell into ruins by the early nineteenth century. Only
two descriptions of the ruins from this period are known to exist. The first was by
Francisco Amangual in 1808 during an expedition from San Antonio to Santa Fe. The
reference is translated from Amangual’s diary of the expedition in Weddle (1999:197): “I
found a small plaza enclosed by a wall on all sides; the wall is constructed of rock and
greatly demolished. There are signs that show there used to be bastions on each corner of
the square. To the north there are ruins of a two-story house. It is evident that there was
a covered road over which they went to the river to get water.” The other reference
during this period comes from the German geologist Ferdinand Roemer, who in 1847

44

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

provided a detailed description of the ruins complete with measurements. Oswald
Mueller published a translation in 1935 (256-257):
We entered the inner courtyard through a breach in the wall and found it in a
suitable place to pitch our tents. The fort lies close to the river on its left or north
bank which is here about twenty feet high. The ruins consist of remnants of
walls, five to six, and in some places fifteen to twenty feet in height. The original
plan of this establishment is still readily discernible. The outer walls enclose an
area of which the shorter side, facing the river, is three hundred feet long, and the
other three hundred sixty feet. In the inside of the outer wall were a number of
rooms or casemates, eighteen feet deep with an entrance leading into the
courtyard. There were about fifty such rooms in the circle of the courtyard. The
main building contained seven rooms and a courtyard whose walls were still
intact up to the crossbeams. It stood in the northwest corner of the establishment.
The main entrance of the fort was on the west side, but a smaller exit also led to
the river. On three corners of the fort were projecting towers for defense, and in
the northwest corner stood a large round tower. The ashlar stones of which the
walls were composed, were bound together by earth. However, on the walls of
the main building one noticed mortar.
Both Amangual and Roemer’s descriptions closely match the maps produced by
both Lafora and Urrutia and give more support for their overall accuracy. The
descriptions also support the possibility of the raised parapets in the northeast and
southwest corners made to resemble bastions as shown on Rábago’s plan map.
Two early twentieth-century descriptions and maps are worthy of mention. The
first is by early Menard resident, John W. Hunter (1905), who published an account of
the history of the Mission San Sabá, largely based on local lore and speculation. Hunter
believed the mission was established many years before 1756, and that in that year it was
decided to convert the mission into a fort called Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas.
Perhaps this was his attempt to explain the extensive ruins still visible at the turn of the
last century. Hunter also produced a map of the presidio based on his interpretation of
the ruins, complete with the entrance to a tunnel to the river (Figure 21). This legend of a
tunnel at the presidio has persisted to the present day among many Menard residents. The
45

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

map is also notable for its depiction of a powder magazine beneath the northwest bastion.
Magazines were often built within the terrapleins of corner bastions during the eighteenth
century (Duffy 2006; Stotz 1985).

Figure 21: John W. Hunter’s 1905 map of San Sabá (incorrectly labeled
“Mission San Sabá”).

In 1936, Edward W. Huesinger published an account of the mission period in
Texas entitled, Early Explorations and Mission Establishments in Texas. Much of
Huesinger’s account of San Sabá is based on Hunter’s booklet, and Huesinger publishes a

46

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

map of the presidio largely based on Hunter’s map (Figure 22). The map is notable for
its mention of gun loopholes in the east wall.

Figure 22: Heusinger’s (1936: 161) map of Presidio San Sabá: Note the mention of loop holes
for muskets along east wall.

CHAPTER VI
RESULTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
Results of Archaeological Investigations
This section discusses the results of excavations conducted in the southeast
bastion area of Presidio San Sabá during the 2005, 2006, and 2007 field seasons. The
following is divided into two sections, architectural remains and artifacts.
Architectural Remains
Based on information from the remote sensing conducted in 2004 and from the
Rábago, Urrutia and Lafora plan maps, test excavations were carried out in July of 2005.
Using the 2004 TAS units as a baseline, four 2-x-2 meter test units were placed in areas
likely to contain architectural remains (Figures 23-25).

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

In an attempt to establish the juncture of the east wall of the presidio and the north
wall of the bastion, unit 2005-1 (Figure 24) was placed overlapping a portion of the 2004
TAS unit N936, E1046. The new unit was excavated 20cm below the surface (Level 1
99.25-99.05m) where the east presidio wall was located, and the unit was closed.
Unit 2005-2 (Figure 24) was placed approximately four meters southwest of
2005-1 surrounding a large flat stone which later proved to be wall fall (stones which
have fallen from a standing wall). While the unit did produce a few Spanish Colonial
artifacts in Level 2 (98.60-98.50m), no architectural remains were present and, therefore,
the unit was discontinued.
Unit 2005-3 (Figure 24) was placed just to the east of 2005-1. In Level 3 (99.098.90m), a large concentration of adobe material was encountered along the north wall of
the excavation unit. The feature was initially interpreted as a stockpile of pre-mixed
adobe material because of its dry, crumbly texture.
Unit 2005-4 (Figure 24) was placed adjacent to, and northeast of, this unit in
order to record the full extent of this adobe concentration. Subsequent investigations
revealed that the concentration was actually a large adobe block, approximately 25
centimeters wide by 40 centimeters long and about 10 centimeters thick (Figure 26). The
block was left in place between the two units, and both units were excavated down to
Level 3 (98.90- 98.80m). Along the boundary between the two units (2005-3 and 20054), large, stacked building stones were encountered in the western portion of the north
wall of 2005-3 which appeared to be in situ. No stones were found above the adobe
block however, indicating a possible gap in the bastion wall (Figure 27).

The fact that the foundations of the southeast bastion are largely intact despite the
golf course construction encouraged further investigation of the area during the TTU
Archaeological Field School in June, 2006. A total of ten 2-x-2-meter units were opened
(Figures 28 and 29). Additionally, excavation units started in previous seasons (TAS
2004 N936, E1046, 2005-3, and 2005-4) were re-opened and excavated further in order
to determine their relationship to the architecture of the bastion. Initially, balks were left
in place between Units 2004 TAS, 2005 -4, 2005-3, and 2006-16; 2005-3, 2006-1; and
the corner between 2006- 16, 2005-3, 2006-14, and 2006-15 (See Figure 28). These
balks were left until it was determined that they were not covering wall alignments, but
were in fact, wall fall. The balks were then carefully removed and the artifacts within
them were bagged and labeled separately.
Architectural elements uncovered at this time included stone foundations of
portions of the north and east walls of the bastion noted in units 2005-4, 2006-2, 2006-1,
2006-11, and 2006-16 (Figures 28, 29). These foundations consist of large, relatively flat
building stones held together with dark brown mud mortar. The east wall also contained
smaller stone rubble, tightly compacted with mud mortar. One of the most interesting
architectural elements was a series of adobe blocks lining the interior of the north wall of
the bastion. Four of these aligned adobes were recorded, including the one mentioned
above found in 2005 (Figure 28). Two of the blocks seem to be complete, while two
others, the ones nearest the northeast interior corner of the bastion, were degraded and
ephemeral. A fifth adobe was uncovered in the southwest quadrant of unit 2006-16,
slightly out of line with the others (Figure 28). All five were found at approximately the
same mean elevation, 98.80 meters. The relationship of these adobes with the stone
52

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

construction is unclear at this time. The blocks could represent the remains of a previous
construction phase, or they might have been added for an unknown function at a later
date.

Another surprising discovery was made in unit 2006-1. A trash midden was
uncovered beginning in Level 4 (98.90-98.80m), containing several “Budweiser” and
“Schlitz” beer cans dated 1936 (Figure 30). The trash pit measured approximately 75
centimeters in diameter and contained several cans and one bottle (See Appendix A).
The pit was likely dug during the 1936 reconstruction of the northwest portion of the fort.

54

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Fortunately, the pit caused very little damage to the surrounding architecture, and intact
Spanish deposits were noted in all other portions of the unit.

Also in June 2006, volunteer members of the TAS excavated one 1-x-2-meter unit
(2006-17) between the bastion and the river. This unit was perpendicular to and
transected an earthwork constructed by the Spanish and parallel to the river. This
earthwork consisted of a trench and parapet and appears on both the Lafora and Urrutia
maps and is also discussed in Lafora’s report to Rubí concerning San Sabá. Such
entrenchments were common in eighteenth-century fortifications (Figures 31, 32).
Because of a concrete slab and a large stack of sheet metal near the golf course
maintenance shed immediately east of the bastion, the segment of the entrenchment
closest to the bastion could not be investigated (Figure 33).

Using the Lafora and Urrutia maps as guides, the 1-x-2-meter unit (2006-17) was
placed in an east-west alignment, in an attempt to reveal the cross-section profile of the
entrenchment. The unit was excavated in 10-centimeter arbitrary levels for a total of
eight levels or 80 centimeters (97.28-92.40m). Spanish-period artifacts were found in
levels 2 through 8 (97.10-96.40m), though not in large quantities, and included ceramics,
debitage, bone, charcoal, and one gunflint (see Appendix B). As hoped, both the profile
drawn at the end of the excavation (Figure 34) and the final photograph (Figure 35),
clearly show the shape of the entrenchment and closely match the documentary
description by Lafora.
Lafora noted that the trench was too shallow and the earthen parapet was too short
to be useful. He also stated that the entrenchment impeded the artillery fire from the
southeast bastion and served instead as cover for the enemy (Lafora to Rubí, August
12,1767). The profile of the north wall of the excavation unit seems to confirm Lafora’s

57

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

description. Future excavations could shed further light on this element of the
fortifications at San Sabá.

Building on the previous work, the goals for the TAS field school in June 2007
included exposing the entire foundation of the bastion and attempting to determine a
building sequence for the structure. A total of 16 2-x-2-meter units were opened along
with two 1-x-2-meter units. In addition, all previous units were reopened, and fill was
removed down to the 2006 levels. At the completion of the field school, photographs
were taken of the exposed foundations of the structure from a bucket truck (Figure 36),
and a plan map of the excavation area was produced (Figure 37).
Most units contained architectural elements. Excavations in Unit 2007-9 (Figure
37) uncovered the extension of the east wall of the bastion and the corner adjoining the
south wall, as well as a portion of the south wall. The east wall was slightly less than one
meter (approximately one vara) wide, and was constructed of small cobbles and rammed
earth mortar, similar to stone and tapia construction as defined by Deagan and Cruxent
(2002a, 2002b). This type of construction was quite common during the entire colonial
period and forms a strong, level foundation upon which larger building stones can be
placed. At the juncture of the east and south walls, the south wall widens to roughly 1.3
meters (Figure 37). This wall is also constructed of small stones and rammed earth,
alternating intermittently with large building stones that run perpendicular to the length of
the wall (Figure 38). Several possibilities may account for the south wall being thicker
than the east wall. First, it parallels the river, a likely place for attack; second, it helps
compensate for the natural slope toward the river; and third, it provides extra support for
the heavy roof. Possibly, larger corner stones were removed from the southeast corner of
the bastion by later Anglo settlers in the Menard area.

Another interesting architectural element discovered in this same unit (2007-9)
was a large adobe block in the southeast corner of the excavation unit, outside the
southeast corner of the bastion (Figure 39). This block, in addition to one found in unit
2007-16, and adobe staining from unit 2006-8, which are all along the exterior of the east
wall, and the blocks found along the interior of the north wall in 2006 (Figure 37) could
represent remnants of the original adobe bastion.

corner of bastion; dashed lines indicate wall alignment (photo by

The southwest corner of the bastion wall was found, after some difficulty, in Unit
2007-12 (Figure 37). A large amount of wall fall covering the entire bastion area
obscured wall alignments making them difficult to find. Nevertheless, careful
examination revealed a row of wall fall lying vertically on edge along the boundary
between units 2007-6 and 2007-11 (Figure 40). This alignment allowed the point of
origin from which the wall fell to be identified and, thus, made the determination of the
west wall alignment possible.

Figure 40: Wall fall with stones lying vertically on edge.

The west wall is similar in width to the south wall (approximately 1.3 meters) and
was also of small stone and rammed earth construction with large flat stones interspersed
throughout. A large, roughly rectangular, mass of puddled adobe (dark brown with an
admixture of tiny gravels) was uncovered in the wall alignment abutting the north wall of
the bastion (south wall of the presidio) (Figure 41). The feature could represent a large
mortar-filled void in the wall or, more likely, a threshold between the bastion and the
horse corral that ran parallel to the south wall of the presidio, shown on the Rábago,
63

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Lafora, and Urrutia maps. Several such puddled adobe thresholds were recorded at
Mission San Lorenzo (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). The puddled adobe threshold was
likely a common construction feature used by soldiers from the San Sabá garrison.

N

remnant (dotted lines). Dashed lines represent outlines of walls (photo by C. Harrell).

Another apparent gap was observed in the north wall alignment of the bastion
between the juncture where the west wall of the bastion meets the south wall of the
presidio and the exterior east wall of the presidio. This space is likely the entrance to the
ground level of the bastion from the interior of the guardhouse that was situated between

64

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

the east gate of the presidio and the bastion (Report by Rábago y Terán, October 19,
1764).
One of the most unexpected findings in the bastion area was an elevated stone and
rammed-earth platform adjacent to the south and west interior walls of the bastion
(Figure 42). The platform was constructed by compacting small stones and mud mortar
within a retaining wall formed in part by the foundations of the south and west walls of
the bastion. Along the eastern edge of the southern portion of the platform, a row of
large stones, three of them still stacked, represents another section of the retaining wall
(Figure 43). This row of stones continues into the foundation of the south bastion wall,
implying that the platform and the wall foundations were constructed at the same time.
Ivey (1988) notes that platforms at other Spanish frontier sites were constructed in an
identical manner. Presumably, sections of retaining walls were also present on the
northern edge of the southern portion of the platform and on the eastern edge of the
western portion of the platform, but due to time constraints these areas were not
examined archaeologically. The platform is elevated approximately 28 centimeters
above the floor of the bastion and is approximately 1.7 meters at its widest point where
the bastion’s south and west walls meet. The southern portion of the platform begins at
the retaining wall, approximately 2 meters west of the east bastion wall. This portion of
the platform follows the south bastion wall to its juncture with the west bastion wall. The
platform then turns to the north and follows the entire length of the west wall of the
bastion to its juncture with the north bastion wall. This configuration also comprises the
entrance to the guardhouse from the bastion (Figure 40).

Figure 43: Portion of retaining wall along eastern edge of southern platform segment. Photo facing

Traces of puddled adobe were noted on the upper surface, along with a curious
circular deposit of puddled adobe in the alignment of the west wall of the bastion abutting
the platform (Figure 44). The puddled adobe circle is baked and has a rock-like hardness
66

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

with a diameter of approximately 31 centimeters. Thus it appears that the entire surface
of the platform was covered in puddled adobe and that all but a few traces have eroded
away. Notably, during the 2006 excavations, parts of the floor near the platform
exhibited a thin covering of adobe melt.

N
Figure 44: Circle of baked puddled adobe (view facing south).

Explaining the circular adobe anomaly has proved difficult. For example, why
does it appear in the wall alignment of the west wall of the bastion? Documentary
evidence indicates that there was a tronera, or cannon embrasure, in the west wall of the
bastion flanking the south wall of the presidio (Lafora to Rubí, August 12, 1767).
Possibly, the circular adobe lies within this embrasure, or opening in the wall. The fact
that the circle is baked and not burned implies that it was exposed to a contained fire,
perhaps from a brasero, or brazier. These vessels, often ceramic, had a hollow base or
ring on which a relatively shallow bowl was placed to contain a fire or coals. A grate or
earthenware vessel for cooking could then be set on top of the bowl (Figure 45). These
vessels were also used to provide heat and light (Lister and Lister 1980). Some of the
burnished redware or lead-glazed sherds are possibly remains of a brazier, but none can
67

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

be definitively identified as part of such a container. Although one was not found
archaeologically, such a vessel was likely set onto the platform’s puddled adobe surface
before it had hardened and settled into the relatively soft surface. Conceivably, the
contained heat inside the vessel could bake the surface below into a rock-like
consistency. The rest of the platform surface, not hardened through baking, simply
eroded away over time. Alternately, there was possibly some kind of corner hearth or
fireplace set into a niche in the wall. This, however, seems unlikely given its proximity
to the embrasure.

Figure 45: Drawing showing general
shape and function of a brasero
(from Di Peso 1953:228).

The elevated feature was likely for one of the small three-pounder cannon
mentioned by Lafora. The platform faces the west wall of the bastion, flanking the south
wall, and provided a smooth, level surface to facilitate loading and recoil, and was
probably elevated in order to compensate for the downward slope toward the river on
which the southern portion of the bastion was built. This configuration would also have
68

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

allowed the cannon to have a greater range of motion vertically along the flank. Similar
platforms were found archaeologically in the bastions at Mission San Lorenzo de Santa
Cruz and Presidio de San Vicente (the final location of the San Sabá garrison) (Ivey
1990; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). Both of these locations were occupied by the San
Sabá garrison for long periods of time and were built by some of the same soldiers, so the
existence of similar architectural features is not surprising (Ivey 1990; Tunnell and
Newcomb 1969) (Figure 46).

Figure 46: Photo showing adobe-covered platform found in bastion at Mission
San Lorenzo (Photo courtesy of Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
image 41RE1-43).

A pile of large, heavy stones was discovered in units 2007-6 and 2007-5 (Figure
47). These stones likely formed a low buttress against a portion of the west wall of the
bastion near the southwest corner and also aided in drainage. The buttress was built by
the Spanish either at the same time the bastion was constructed or at a later date in an
69

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

area of the wall that was experiencing drainage problems. If indeed there was a tronera
near the southwest corner, this would weaken the wall to some extent, and these large
stones would help to strengthen this segment of the wall. This is especially true if
drainage problems were occurring. Archaeologically, similar buttress/drain systems were
also noted at Mission San Lorenzo and Presidio de San Vicente outside the bastion
corners and adjacent walls (Ivey 1990; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). Apparently the San
Sabá soldiers continued this practice at subsequent fortifications they constructed.

Artifact Analysis
A study of the artifact and ecofact assemblage from the southeast bastion sheds
light on how the structure functioned in the daily lives of the soldiers stationed at San
70

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Sabá. As noted by Voss (2008: 302), in her study of the presidio of San Francisco,
“material practices constitute the interface between institutional systems of power and the
agency of social subjects. They are the media through which people navigate, respond to,
and precipitate the historical events that constitute their lives.” A study of the material
practices of the military settlers at San Sabá provides valuable information about their
foodways, clothing, status relationships, and activities performed while on duty in the
bastion. The artifacts were processed and analyzed at the TTU Archaeological
Laboratory. For the purposes of this study, all bastion artifacts were divided into several
working categories: building materials (excluding nails which were grouped with metal
materials), glass, ceramics, lithics, and metal objects. Ecofacts included faunal materials
in the forms of bone and shell. Building materials such as adobe and mortar were
weighed. Modern glass fragments were counted and weighed, while Spanish Colonial
glass shards, beads, and jewelry items were counted and weighed. Ceramics were
counted, measured, weighed, categorized by attributes, and described. All metal objects
were counted, measured, weighed, classified by function, and described. Lithics were
counted, measured, weighed, classified by form and function, and described. Bone was
weighed, while shell was counted, weighed, and classified by genus. For an inventory of
artifacts by level within each unit, see Appendix C.
While the architectural foundations were found to be intact, it should be noted that
some disturbance of the stratigraphic context of the artifacts is likely. The area in and
around the southeast bastion was probably occupied by Native American groups as well
as early Anglo settlers in the Menard area after the presidio was abandoned. Diagnostic
Spanish colonial artifacts as well as lithic materials that could be the result of either
71

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Spanish or Native American activities were found in every level excavated within the
bastion (see Appendix C). Thus, no artifacts can be clearly linked to a Native American
occupation. However, some of the lithic tools and debitage as well as some of the bone
tempered ceramics likely represent use of the space by Native Americans. The roof and
walls likely collapsed in stages over time (see Figure 99), mixing materials probably left
on the roof by the Spanish with those of later Native American occupations of the
bastion. This slow deterioration of the structure resulted in the mixing of stones from the
rubble-built walls with the Spanish and later deposits and may have deterred some more
recent looting. Twentieth- and twenty-first-century deposits are evidence of more recent
activities in the bastion area (see Appendix G). Many of these items are linked to
activities related to the site’s current use as a golf course. The vast majority of recent
materials was found at or just below the surface (see Appendix G).
Building Materials
Adobe and Mortar
The most common building material in the bastion, other than the building stones
and mud mortar, was puddled adobe (Table 1). This material was used as a thick roof
surface, to coat and level the cannon platform, and as a threshold material. Two different
varieties were apparently used. The roof coating is a dense, smooth material that was
allowed to bake in the sun (Figure 48). Surprisingly, the roofing material is relatively
free of gravels, which were commonly used as a tempering agent. Leaks were easily
repaired by simply adding another coat of mud. The vast majority of the 8470.5 grams of
puddled adobe collected from the bastion was of this type.

72

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Figure 48: Puddled adobe roofing material. Note wood impressions on top
surfaces of both specimens.

The other type of puddled adobe was used to coat the platform and as a threshold
at the entrance to the bastion from the corral in the west wall of the bastion. This
material was of the same dark brown mud as the roofing material with the addition of
very fine gravels as a tempering agent. The baked, circular remnant on the platform
surface also consisted of this material, and traces of this type of adobe were left on the
platform as well. Similar mud mortar was noted at San Lorenzo (Tunnell and Newcomb
1969).
The adobes which lined the interior of the north wall of the bastion, as well as
those on the exterior of the east wall, are of the same mud and fine gravel material with
the addition of river sand. These adobes have a Munsell color of 7.5YR7/4 as opposed to
that of the surrounding matrix with a Munsell color of 10YR5/2. Whitehead (1996) notes
that the best material for making adobe bricks contains sand to prevent cracking.
A light grey to white material (Munsell color was 5Y8/4) was also recovered from
the bastion and its use is unknown at this time, although it could represent lime that has
73

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

not yet been crushed into powder. This material is densely packed with a powdery
consistency similar to that of modern richmortar. Perhaps this material was being
collected for use in a future construction or repair phase. A total of 1079.1 grams of this
material were recovered from the bastion.
One specimen of lime mortar weighing 34.8 grams was recovered from unit 200611. While it is impossible to say whether or not such lime mortar was used in the bastion
area, it seems highly unlikely since only one piece was recovered (Table 1)
Wood and Charcoal
A total of 183.7 grams of wood was recovered from within the bastion. Of this
material, very little of it is likely to date to the colonial era. Most of the samples are from
higher excavation levels and are probably relatively recent wood and bark fragments
deposited naturally. One fragment found in situ in Level 4 (98.80-98.70m) of unit 200612 may be a fragment of roofing or other construction material. The fragment measures
176 cm x 67.8 cm x 33.9 cm and weighs 98.6g. Wood preservation is quite good at the
site. In 2004, a portion of the south stockade wall of the horse corral was excavated
which contained three intact, vertical wooden post bases (Walter et al. 2005) (Figure 49).
Notably, the wood fragment excavated from within the bastion was lying horizontally,
yet it does not appear to be a root fragment (Appendix D).
A relatively small amount of charcoal (367.2 g) was recovered during bastion
excavations (Appendix E). While several units contained small amounts of charcoal,
concentrations were noted in Units 2005-3, 2006-12, 2006-14, and 2007-14 (See Figure
38). Units 2005-3, 2006-12, and 2006-14 are all on the interior of the bastion and
charcoal was found in association with other Spanish colonial deposits. The charcoal
74

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

from these units could represent disposal from small, contained fires for cooking, light, or
heating. Charcoal from Unit 2007-14 (just outside the south bastion wall) could be
indicative of disposal from the roof or, since it was found just below the surface, simply
be from a more recent camping episode.

Glass
A total of 1124.8 grams of glass was recovered from excavations within the
southeast bastion (Table 2). Most of the glass fragments (887 fragments weighing
1092.8 grams) are modern and consist of auto, window, and bottle glass. Glass items
were comparatively rare on the frontier of northern New Spain, and consisted of bottles,
drinking and storage vessels, and beads and other personal items (Deagan 2002; Voss
2008). Only 26 glass items found in the bastion are of Spanish Colonial or possible
Spanish Colonial origin and consist of bottle glass, two beads, two seed beads (Figure
50), a button or cufflink with a glass inset, and one square faceted inset from a jewelry
item (Figure 51) (Table 3).
The Spanish Colonial bottle glass recovered in the southeast bastion at San Sabá
is generally thick and heavily patinated and either green or an indeterminate dark color.
This bottle glass is probably from wine bottles, although the shards are so small,
identification is difficult since no rim or base fragments were noted in the assemblage.
Wine was probably imported from Europe, but conceivably at least some was produced
and imported from Mexican or Texas missions. Some of the light brown, thinner glass
that is lightly patinated is possibly from glass wares, although again, identification is
difficult. Deagan states that glass wares exported to the Spanish colonies were
“dominated by foreign wares” from England, France, and Germany (1987:129). She also
points out that glass wares were being produced in Puebla, Mexico during the eighteenth
century (1987:129-130). Some of the light brown, patinated glass assemblage at San
Sabá likely derived from this Mexican source, although a portion of it could have
originated in Europe.

Glass beads of the types found in the southeast bastion at San Sabá were probably
imported from either Spain or Mexico during the entire colonial period, and similar bead
assemblages have been found at several Spanish colonial sites in Texas (Fox and Tomka
2006; Tunnell and Ambler 1967; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969; Walter 1997; Walter et al.
2003; Walter 2007). Such beads were often used as both trade beads and personal
adornment for colonial settlers (Deagan 2002). In all, four such beads were recovered
79

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

during the bastion excavations. One specimen (Figure 50a) is a small blue bead with a
diameter of 5.8 mm and a length of 4.2 mm. A large, barrel-shaped, iridescent aqua bead
was also found and has a diameter of 8.9mm and a length of 7.6mm (Figure 50b). Two
blue seed beads (Figure 50c, 50d) were also recovered. Small beads of this type were
often used as trade beads or as embroidery beads (Voss 2008). The larger beads are
likely either from jewelry or rosaries. As Deagan (2002:69) notes, “unfortunately, it is
not possible to distinguish confidently glass beads used in jewelry from those used in
rosaries.”

bead; c and d: blue seed beads).

Other glass items for personal adornment found within the bastion include one
brass cufflink or button with a clear glass inset (Figure 51a). The cufflink or button is
10mm in diameter and was likely considered a high-status item. A square, clear, faceted
inset measuring 8.0mm in width and 5.3mm in thickness (Figure 51b) was also
recovered. This faceted piece of glass is probably from a necklace or ring, although
conceivably it could be from a button or cufflink (Table 3).

Ceramics
Ceramic items comprise a large portion of the artifact assemblage from the
bastion and are “one of the most distinctive characteristics of Spanish colonial site
assemblages…” (Deagan 1987:25). Spain and her colonies had a long, rich heritage of
ceramic production by the eighteenth century. Ceramic assemblages from Spanish
Colonial sites contain many types in the Moorish-influenced Andalusian tradition (Lister
and Lister 1987). The assemblage from the southeast bastion is dominated by tinenameled earthenwares, followed by lead-glazed earthenwares. A large number of
81

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

unglazed ceramic sherds were also present (see Figure 52). Similar percentages have
been noted for the assemblages from other parts of the site (Walter et al. 2003; Zayatz
2004).

Figure 52: Relative percentages of ceramic types from the southeast bastion based
on surface treatment.

Of the tin-glazed earthenwares, all but two sherds (which were faience or
delftware) were majolicas. Majolica is the common term for Spanish or Mexican-made
tin-enameled ceramics, while faience and delftware were French and English or Dutch
versions of the same, respectively (Deagan 1987). Most sherds were too small to be
categorized into types, but majolica types that were identified include: Puebla Blue-onWhite (1675-1830), Huejotzingo (1700-1850), San Elizario Polychrome or Playa
Polychrome (1750-1850), and Abó Polychrome (1650-1750), (Deagan 1987) (Figure 53)
(Table 4). Interestingly, based on published archaeological investigations, presidios
generally have a higher percentage of majolicas than do missions (Fournier 1997). This
higher percentage of majolicas at presidios is likely due to the higher socioeconomic
82

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

status associated with military service (Deagan 1983; Fournier 1997; Voss 2008). For
other published works with similar presidio ceramic assemblages, see Bense 2003,
Deagan 1983, Di Peso 1953, Fournier 1997, Fournier and Blackman 2008, Voss 2008,
Walter et al. 2003, and Zayatz 2004.

Figure 53: Samples of majolica from the bastion area (a-c: probable San Elizario polychrome;
d-g: unidentified polychrome; h-j: unidentified blue-on-white).

The largest fragment of any majolica vessel from the southeast bastion comes
from an Abó Polychrome plato, or soup plate. The plato features a human figure, off
center, with a tonsured hairstyle, who resembles a Franciscan friar or monk, with an
83

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

unidentified rectangular object behind him (Figure 54). Abó Polychrome was
manufactured in Puebla, Mexico between 1650 and 1750 (Deagan 1987) and is noted in
several Spanish colonial sites in Texas as well as other parts of Spanish North America
(For example see: Fox and Tomka 2006; Ivey 1981; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969; Walter
et al. 2003; Zayatz 2005).

Lead-glazed earthenwares are the next most abundant ceramic found in the
bastion. Earthenwares are found in a variety of glaze colors and were used for storing
and preparing food. Spanish olive jars are one of the most common ceramics found at
Spanish Colonial sites, including San Sabá (Figure 55) and were initially used to ship
olives and olive oil to the New World, but the large jars were often recycled and were
used for a variety of storage needs (Deagan 1987; Noël Hume 1969). The earthenware
sample at San Sabá is dominated by green lead-glazed wares (Figure 56). Green-glazed
wares were probably meant to resemble the Spanish olive jars (Figure 55) and are found
in large numbers at presidios and other Spanish Colonial sites across northern New Spain
(Fournier 1997). Fournier (1997:237) defines this as “Presidios Green” and, more
recently (2008:19) as “Presidios Verde.” Fournier’s (1997) petrographic analysis
88

indicates that this green lead-glazed ceramic was probably produced in the GuanajuatoZacatecas region of Mexico. For an inventory of lead-glazed ceramics found in the
southeast bastion, see Table 5.

Two sherds of black lead-glazed ceramic are mentioned here because of their
unusual designs. Both have an appliquéd design motif featuring sets of concentric
circles, and one features an appliquéd leaf design as well (Figure 57). Undecorated black
lead-glazed wares are frequently found at Spanish colonial sites (Deagan 1987), but none
with similar appliquéd designs are described.

Other decorative ceramics from the southeast bastion include painted
earthenwares, burnished earthenwares, porcelain, and faience or delft wares (Table 6).
The painted earthenwares (Figure 58) may represent fragments of Guadalajara
polychrome, which is characterized by a cream to buff slip that is highly polished, with
rust, brown, and black painted decoration (Deagan 1987). Redwares dominate the
sample of burnished earthenwares found in the southeast bastion (Figure 59). These
sherds have a red to orange paste and are highly polished but unglazed (Zayatz 2004).
Porcelains are comparatively rare on frontier sites. Eight sherds of porcelain were found
during the bastion excavations (Figure 60). Porcelains represent an exotic, high-status
item, as they were imported from China and Japan (Deagan 1987). As previously noted,

92

only two sherds of faience or delft tin-glazed earthenware were found within the bastion
(Figure 61).

The remainder of the ceramics sample from the southeast bastion consists of
unglazed colonial earthenwares, bone-tempered earthenware (Figure 62), severely burned
and unclassifiable ceramics, and post-colonial ceramics (Table 7). The bone-tempered
earthenware sherds represent a variety of paste and surface colors and textures and, until
further analysis is completed, cannot be specifically assigned to particular native groups.
Approximately 61% of the bone-tempered ceramics were found in the upper two
excavation levels (Table 7) (some units were excavated only through the first level,
which may skew the percentages). However, no bone-tempered ceramics were found in
levels that did not also contain diagnostic Spanish ceramics. Some of the bone-tempered
ceramics, those found near the surface, could represent later occupations of the presidio
site by nomadic Native American groups or were perhaps acquired through trade.
Alternately, the bone-tempered specimens found in colonial contexts were possibly
brought to the presidio by native wives of presidial soldiers, assuming that some soldiers
had married native women on the frontier. No records of such marriages were located
during the documentary research for this study. Interestingly, no fragments of
nineteenth-century ceramics were identified in the bastion assemblage, although some
such wares have been found in other parts of the presidio (Zayatz 2005). The four sherds
of post-colonial ceramics consist of twentieth- or twenty-first century pottery.

Metal
Spanish Colonial metal artifacts recovered from the bastion excavations were
divided into categories based on function, following Norment (2007). These categories
consist of horse equipment, military objects, construction-related material and hardware,
domestic objects, personal objects, trade items, and miscellaneous objects. Many items
were unidentifiable and were categorized as indeterminate. A large number of modern
(mostly twentieth and twenty-first centuries) metal objects was recovered in the upper
excavation levels and is not discussed here but are listed in Appendix G.

Horse-Related Metal Objects
Horse equipment comprises much of the bastion metal assemblage, as was
expected. Artifacts in this category include horseshoe nails (Figure 63); several bridle
parts such as a slack chain tab (Figure 65a) and rein chain fragments (Figure 64a-c),
various rings (Figure 64d-g), and jinglers (Figures 65b-d). A tongue from a harness
buckle (Figure 69a) (Figure 70) and other possible horse gear (Figure 69b-c) also form a
portion of this category (Table 8).

The elaborate ring bit with the attached jinglers, or coscojos, is known
archaeologically only in the Spanish borderlands (Figure 66). Simmons and Turley
(1980) note that the jinglers provided a pleasant jingling sound while riding. The larger,
heavier jinglers and the higa (Figure 65e) were likely attached to the anquera, or rump
covering (Figure 67), whose purpose was “to strike the horses’ hocks to make them
prance” (Di Peso 1953:194) (Figure 68).

Military-Related Metal Objects
Surprisingly, a relatively small number of military-related metal items were
recovered during the bastion excavations (Table 9). These metal military objects include
items such as an iron gun worm (Figure 71), which was threaded onto the tip of the
ramrod of a musket and used to retrieve a stuck cloth or paper wad, or lead shot. A cloth
might also be attached to the gun worm for cleaning the inside of the barrel of the
weapon (Peterson 1968). An almost identical specimen was recovered from Mission San
Lorenzo (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). A possible iron counter lock plate was also
identified (Figure 72) and was likely used to anchor the gun lock (DiPeso 1953). While
some such plates were more decorative, DiPeso (1953) depicts an example recovered at
the Terrenate presidio that is very similar to the piece found at San Sabá (Figure 73).
101

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Alternately, this object was a heel chain spacer from a spur (Jay C. Blaine, personal
communication, 2008).

identical to the specimen found at San Sabá.

102

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Several lead military objects were recovered, including shot (Figure 74e-g), one
specimen of canister shot (Figure 74d), two cylinders (Figure 74a-b), and a disk (Figure
74c). Although no lead sprue was found within the bastion, other portions of the site
have yielded evidence that soldiers made their own lead shot by pouring molten lead into
molds (Norment 2007). Canister shot was an anti-personnel weapon whose name is
derived from the case or canister filled with “scrap, musket balls, or slugs” (Manucy
1985:69) (Figure 75). When fired from the cannon, the shot would scatter in a wide
pattern, much like that created by a shotgun, and was very effective at close range. The
specimen at San Sabá is too large to be of any standard musket caliber and therefore
probably represents such a projectile. The lead cylinders may also be from canister shot,
or were possibly larger-caliber shot carefully hammered into a smaller diameter to fit a
smaller-caliber weapon (Jay C. Blaine, personal communication, 2008). Lead disks
identical to the one found in the bastion have been found elsewhere at San Sabá and at
other Spanish Colonial sites. The exact function of these items is unknown, but several
possibilities are suggested. Tunnell and Newcomb (1969) suggest that these disks could
be counterweights for a balance. Blaine suggests these items were used as score-keeping
counters for games, although other uses are also possible (Jay C. Blaine, personal
communication, 2008). Alternately, the disks may represent flattened lead shot intended
for use as a pad for a gunflint within the jaws of the cock (Fox and Tomka 2006;
Norment 2007).

Construction-Related Metal Items
Nails (Figure 76) were the only metal construction-related material recovered in
the bastion (see Table 10). Spanish Colonial nails were hand-wrought from iron and
were relatively scarce on the frontier (Norment 2007; Simmons and Turley 1980). A few
of the nails from the southeast bastion are probably nineteenth-century cut nails deposited
by travelers or early Anglo settlers in the Menard area. Colonial nails were used in the
construction of a variety of wooden objects including doors, chests, cabinets, and boxes.
Often, when a nail was used to fasten one piece of wood to another, the nail was driven
through both pieces and bent into a 90-degree angle for added security (Figure 77). This
method makes possible a relatively-accurate estimate of the thickness of the wood used
(Simmons and Turley 1980; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). Because iron was relatively
scarce on the frontier, often nails were used sparingly in construction projects. Wooden
pegs or rawhide thongs were often substituted (Whitehead 1996). The bastion specimens
were likely used in shelving, storage boxes, or doors and door jambs.

Domestic Metal Objects
Domestic items include implements used in food preparation and dining. A
spike-tanged, narrow-bolstered, wide-bladed case knife fragment was recovered during
bastion excavations (Jay C. Blaine, personal communication, April 2008) (Figure 78), as
were thin iron and brass kettle or pot fragments or repair patches (Table 11). Since metal
was a relatively scarce commodity on the frontier, damaged metal cooking vessels were
often repaired and patched as needed (Norment 2007). Such repair patch fragments are
commonly noted at Spanish colonial frontier sites (Fox and Tomka 2006).

Personal Metal Objects
Personal artifacts include items such as buttons, button backs and tops, a heartshaped pendant, and decorative brass appliqués (Table 12). The brass appliqués (Figure
79) are likely from a small decorative wooden box, as the fragments exhibit long, straight
edges and the nail holes are too large to have come from a musket stock (Jay C. Blaine,
personal communication, 2008). The heart-shaped pendant (Figure 80a) was proposed by
Blaine to be a symbol of the sacred, twisted heart of Christ (Jay C. Blaine, personal
communication, 2008). Some of the brass buttons and two-piece or composite buttons
107

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

found during bastion excavations (Figure 80b-g) were probably from military uniform
components. Similar buttons were found in other areas at San Sabá (Walter et al. 2003;
Norment 2007) as well as at several Spanish Colonial sites across northern New Spain,
the Caribbean, and California (Deagan 2002; Di Peso 1953; Hindes et al. 1999; Meissner
2002; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). Di Peso(1953) and Voss (2008) note that such brass
buttons were probably of military issue but could also be found on civilian clothing as
well. Deagan (2002) states that composite buttons often featuring a bone back and a
brass or copper- alloy top are common on Spanish sites after about 1750. However, no
bone button back was recovered from the southeast bastion. Tunnell and Newcomb
(1969) report a brass button top with a fragment of a wooden back still attached found at
Mission San Lorenzo. The top from this button is identical to one specimen (Figure 80,d)
recovered during southeast bastion excavations at San Sabá, as well as others from
elsewhere at Presidio San Sabá (Walter, et al. 2002).

Miscellaneous Metal Objects
Included among the miscellaneous metal items was an iron skewer-shaped object
(Figure 81) whose exact function is unknown, however, several possibilities exist. The
skewer may be a surveyor’s pin, since it was found with its tip in the ground against the
109

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

west wall of the bastion in the corral. Surveyor’s pins were used to secure the surveyor’s
chain during construction or mapping of the presidio. Another possibility is that the
object is a cannon gunner’s pick (Figure 82) used to clear the vent and to puncture the
cloth or paper powder cartridge after it was rammed into the cannon tube (Manucy 1985;
Peterson 1968). Finally, the artifact may represent a skewer used in food preparation, but
its short length would make it difficult to handle for such a purpose. Many items in the
miscellaneous category were unidentifiable (Figure 83) (Table 13) and were classified as
such.

Indeterminate Metal Objects
The largest category of Spanish colonial metal includes items that could not be
identified and were therefore classified as indeterminate (Table 14). Norment (2007)

111

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

notes that indeterminate objects make up a large percentage of metal objects found in
other portions of the presidio as well.

Lithics
A total of 1667 lithic artifacts were collected from the bastion excavations.
Chipped stone artifacts make up the entire sample, since no groundstone was recovered.
Of this total, debitage (excluding cores) made up 1561 items (93.64% of the assemblage),
112

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

weighing 4922.1 grams (Table 15). Terminology for the analysis of the lithic sample
follows Turner and Hester (1999) and Whittaker (1994). A total of 14 cores and core
fragments (0.84% of the assemblage), weighing 2719.1 grams was excavated from the
southeast bastion. These cores and fragments are from local chert sources and were
likely used to make most of the lithic tools and gunflints in the assemblage (Figure 84).
The large amount of debitage and cores from within the bastion, combined with the fact
that the lithic tools were found in association with gunflints and other Spanish colonial
artifacts suggests that soldiers were manufacturing tools and gunflints on site. Lithic
assemblages from other Spanish colonial sites in Texas include many of the same types
of items; although percentages and the presence of some artifact types vary (see Table
16) (see Tomka 1999; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969).

Lithic Tools
Lithic tools included 14 biface fragments, four unifaces (Figure 85), 14 uniface
fragments, one discoidal uniface (Figure 86), one modified cobble, one split cobble, and
28 modified flakes (Table 17). At least some of the bifacial and unifacial specimens, as
well as the blade fragment, were possibly intended for the manufacture of gunflints.
Modified flakes and cobbles, which were possibly intended as expediency tools, are
inventoried in Table 18.
Bifaces
While no complete bifaces were recovered, 14 biface fragments were found
within the southeast bastion, making up 0.96% of the total lithic assemblage. Bifacial
117

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

tools were used for a variety of purposes including cutting, sawing, butchering, and
scraping. As noted by Whittaker (1994:246), “a medium-sized biface is a good allpurpose butchering tool. It endures heavy cutting around joints where you will strike
bone often. In detaching hides, the sharp but controllable edge of a biface is less likely to
cut the hide than an irregularly shaped razor-sharp flake.” At least some of the biface
fragments from the southeast bastion were likely broken during manufacture and
discarded, while others show evidence of use wear, although microscopic use-wear
analysis was not performed on any of the lithic assemblage from the bastion. Bifaces take
more time to manufacture than do some other tools, but they can be retouched or
resharpened several times during their use life (Turner and Hester 1999).
Unifaces
Five complete unifaces (Figures 85 and 86) were discovered during southeast
bastion excavations including one discoidal. The discoidal (Figure 86) measures 49.7mm
in diameter by 17.6mm thick, weighs 60.1g and is made of a coarse-grained chert and
was ground or polished smooth on its ventral surface. A similar specimen is described by
Tunnell and Newcomb (1969). The exact function of this object is unknown, but it was
possibly used as a polishing stone.
The other complete unifaces are shown in Figure 85 and comprise 0.24% of the
lithic assemblage. The first specimen (Figure 85a) (Unit 2006-12 Level 1 [99.3099.00m]) measures 24.8mm by 16.9mm, is 5.0mm thick, and weighs 2.9g. Manufactured
on a flake, it likely served as an expediency knife and is still sharp. The second uniface
(Figure 85b) (Unit 2007-1 Level 1 [99.10-98.90]) is an end scraper and measures 48.4 by
39.1 by 10.8 and weighs 24.6g. The third specimen (Figure 85c) (Unit 2007-4 Level 1
118

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

[99.10-99.00]) is an end and side scraper measuring 46.1mm long by 20.1mm wide by
6.0mm thick and weighs 5.6g and manufactured on a blade. The final example (Figure
85d) (Unit 2005-2 Level 2 [98.60-98.50]) measures 68.8mm long by 30.1mm wide by
16.1mm thick and weighs 45.7g. This tool is an end and side scraper with a steeplybeveled proximal edge. The unifacial tools found near the surface could represent a later,
post-presidio native occupation of the bastion, although some modern disturbance in
stratigraphy is likely.

Figure 86: “Discoidal” uniface (terminology from
Tunnell and Newcomb 1969: 118, 120).

In addition, 14 uniface fragments were recovered (8.4% of the assemblage), likely
broken during use or manufacture. Unifacially-worked tools often have the advantage of
being thin and sharp and can be resharpened quickly until discarded (Whittaker 1994).
Modified Flakes and Cobbles
Edge-modified flakes are also considered expediency tools. Twenty-eight such
specimens were recovered during bastion excavations (1.68% of the total lithic
assemblage). Modification comes in the form of use wear or intentional modification by
pressure flaking. Lithic flakes can be many times sharper than steel, although they are
not as durable (Whittaker 1994). The bastion specimens were likely used for cutting and
splitting leather or hides by soldiers repairing or creating horse or military related gear.
One modified cobble and one split cobble (0.12% of the assemblage) were also recovered
archaeologically from the bastion. Tools of this type were often used for cutting,
chopping, or scraping implements and were possibly also used in leatherworking inside
the bastion.

Gunflints
As expected, a relatively large number of gunflints (Figure 87) was found in the
southeast bastion excavations. Villalobos (2003:81) notes that the blade and “scraper
type” gunflints were the most common types found at presidio sites and concludes that
122

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

the soldiers were likely manufacturing these types themselves. The gunflint analysis
used in this thesis follows the terminology of Kenmotsu (1990) and Villalobos (2003).

Figure 87: Sample of gunflints from the southeast bastion (a, b, e, g, h: escopeta size;
c: pocket pistol size; d, f: pistol size; i: fusil size).

Twenty-two complete gunflints and seven gunflint fragments were recovered. All
but one of these artifacts are probably of local manufacture of local chert, and many may
have been produced within the bastion itself. One specimen (Figures 88 and 89) is honey
colored and exhibits a different method of manufacturing from all other examples. This
gunflint is possibly of European origin, based on traits described by Kenmotsu (1990).
123

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

All specimens showed use wear on at least one working edge, and several exhibited such
wear on multiple edges. Some are broken and were likely discarded, while others were
used heavily before being replaced. The size chart used to categorize the gunflints was
adapted from Peterson (1968:63) by changing “carbine” to “escopeta” and “musket” to
“fusil” to reflect the Spanish names for these weapons (Figure 90). Escopetas were
heavy, smooth-bore muskets with shorter barrels, thus making them easier for use by
cavalry or dragoons. Fusiles were light, long-barreled, smooth-bore muskets often used
by infantry (Brinkerhoff and Chamberlain 1972, Peterson 1968). However, these terms
were often used interchangeably, and it is possible that both weapon types were used at
San Sabá. Some gunflint fragments were too incomplete to be categorized by weapon
size based on Peterson’s (1968) chart (Table 19). While Turner and Hester (1999) note
that there may be some correlation between the size of the gunflint and the size of the
weapon, it should also be noted that virtually any size gunflint could be used in any
weapon as long as the flint fit securely in the jaws of the cock and still produced
sufficient sparks (Kenmotsu 1990). Also worthy of mention here is the fact that some
gunflints in the bastion assemblage were broken, retouched, or worn making exact
correlation of gunflint size and weapon size difficult. Figure 91 shows the percentages of
gunflints found in the bastion as classified using Peterson’s size chart. Interestingly,
pistol sized gunflints comprise 40 percent of the sample although, again, some were
likely retouched or worn to a smaller size. Artillery crews possibly carried pistols as
opposed to muskets while servicing the cannon. Two pocket pistol-sized gunflints
(Figure 92a-b) were recovered from within the bastion. One specimen (Figure 92b) could
be the base of a Guerrero point that has been reworked a gunflint, or alternately, the
124

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

object could have a notch flaked out to allow for the screw of the cock. Pocket pistols
were comparatively rare on the frontier, and likely were personal sidearms carried by an
officer or someone of high status (Brinkerhoff and Chamberlain 1972; Peterson 1968).

Faunal Material
Bone
A relatively large amount of bone was recovered from the bastion excavations.
The majority of units produced varying amounts of food bone (Table 20). The total
weight of unburned bone was 6998.7 grams (96.6% of all bone), while 246.9 grams
(3.4%) of burned bone were recovered. While a more complete faunal analysis is
pending, bone collected from the bastion likely represents species similar to those found
in other areas of the presidio including cattle/ bison, goat/sheep, deer, gar, and catfish
(Walter et al. 2003). Most of the bone is probably from meals cooked elsewhere and
brought into the bastion; however, some of the bone likely represents the remains of
127

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

meals cooked within the bastion or the adjacent guardhouse by soldiers on duty. Once
consumed, the bones from these meals were either discarded on the floor or swept outside
the confines of the bastion. Some of the bone found near the surface is either from later
occupations of the site or from passing travelers camping within the ruins.

Shell
Shell also forms part of the faunal deposits in the bastion area. Shells collected
include freshwater mussel and three species of snail, although snail shells were not
systematically collected (Table 21). Freshwater mussels were likely consumed by the
inhabitants of the presidio, although they were apparently not a major part of the diet.
Within the bastion, a total of 1283.8 grams of mussel shell was recovered. Thirty-two
left and 51 right umbos were identified, thus placing the minimum number of individuals
(MNI) at 51. The snails were probably not a source of food for the Spanish and likely
represent both past and recent intrusions by ground-dwelling snail varieties. Snails are
often attracted to the rich, organic soil found within middens at archaeological sites.

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Snail genera represented include Rabdotus, Mesodon, and Holospira. For a more
detailed representation of shell found in the bastion, see Appendix F.
Only one shell artifact, a button (Figure 93), was recovered during excavations
inside the southeast bastion. The button is 10.2mm in diameter, 1.3mm in thickness, and
weighs 0.2g. The specimen features a floral relief-carved motif with four holes and was
likely considered a relatively high status item because of its decoration (Voss 2008).
Such decorative buttons were worn by both men and women (Voss 2008).

Interpretation of the Cultural Material
Using the artifacts and cultural materials found within the southeast bastion, a
fairly detailed description of the daily lives of the soldiers on and off duty is presented.
Based on the archaeological evidence, life within the bastion consisted of long hours of
working on mundane tasks such as maintenance of horse gear, weapons, manufacturing
gunflints, and eating. Bastions were typically male spaces reserved for military
personnel (Stotz 1985). As was common in such military areas, especially in hostile
territory, soldiers trained in artillery were certainly assigned guard duty inside the bastion
as well as on the roof. The cleaning and maintaining of weapons was a common pastime
for men assigned to such duties, as well as for those who were off duty (Brinkerhoff and
Chamberlain 1972). The archaeological evidence for such activity within the bastion is
in the form of used or broken gunflints, likely dropped or discarded during replacement.
Weapon maintenance is further evidenced by the gunworm; as such items were used to
clear and swab the barrel of a musket or pistol (Peterson 1968).
Horse equipment fragments recovered archaeologically from within the bastion
are evidence of bridle and harness repair, another common pastime for cavalry soldiers
(Peterson 1968). The jinglers found within the bastion were likely lost during routine
maintenance and repair of such equipment.
Many of the lithic tools, such as scrapers and edge-modified flakes, were possibly
used in leather working in order to repair harnesses, belts, saddles, or other horse-related
items. Perhaps such stone tools saved wear and tear on metal knife blades and could be
resharpened until useless and then discarded. Given the scarcity of metal and the
abundance of stone, it seems probable that stone replaced metal whenever possible.
134

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Flintknapping was another activity within the bastion, based on the archaeological
evidence. The number of cores, core fragments, and debitage found in association with
other colonial artifacts suggests that the soldiers were manufacturing gunflints and other
lithic tools within the bastion. All but one of the gunflints and all of the other lithic tools,
even the finely-worked bifacial specimens, were of local chert. An almost identical
assemblage (see Table 16) was recovered at Mission San Lorenzo (Tunnell and
Newcomb 1969), garrisoned with soldiers from San Sabá. As noted by Shafer
(2006:121):
Locally-made biface gunflints are generally assumed to have been made by
Native Americans, but this assumption is logically flawed. Biface gunflints are
the most prevalent forms found in Spanish Colonial sites, and it would be
technologically inconsistent for the soldiers not to be able to maintain their own
weapons and to have a Native American following along to create their gunflints.
Villalobos (2003) also suggests that presidial soldiers manufactured their own gunflints,
noting that blade and scraper-type gunflints were the most common types found at
presidios, and the same holds true for those recovered within the bastion at San Sabá.
Thus, it is possible that at least some of the scrapers and found within the bastion were
intended for modification into gunflints.
Archaeological evidence of foodways of the soldiers within the bastion is
provided by the large amounts of animal bone, small amounts of mussel shell, and the
relatively large amount of ceramic artifacts recovered. The ceramic assemblage has a
high percentage of majolicas (42%) and lead-glazed wares (28%), suggesting that most of
the food consumed within the bastion was cooked elsewhere and brought inside.
Majolicas are serving and table wares while lead-glazed wares are associated with storage
and cooking, although Voss (2008) points out that lead-glazed wares were also table
135

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

wares. Voss (2008) also notes that it was common practice at the San Francisco presidio
for food to be prepared by individual family groups and shared with unmarried soldiers
and for meals to be shared communally by small groups. Perhaps the same could have
been true of soldiers on duty at San Sabá as well. Meals were probably prepared and
brought to the bastion by the wives of the soldiers. However, at least some meals were
likely cooked or reheated inside the bastion as evidenced by the small amounts of burned
ceramics and the lead-glazed cooking and storage vessels recovered within the bastion.
The relatively high percentage of majolicas is probably further evidence of male/military
presence, as these wares have been associated with male, high status, and military sites
due to the higher cost of such wares (Deagan 1983; Fornier 1997; Williams 1992).
Majolicas and porcelains were often displayed and used at meals to publicly show social
status in “male,” military areas of the fort, while unglazed cookwares were often only
used in the “female” realm of the home (Deagan 1983: 105). Since meals were probably
a shared experience by soldiers on duty, perhaps this was an occasion to highlight subtle
status differences by eating from more expensive majolicas or even porcelains. Some
cooking was perhaps done inside the bastion on a brazier or other such vessel. Disposal
of food and bone scraps in the southeast bastion was done by simply tossing the remains
on the floor. Conceivably, at least some of the ceramic assemblage was deposited in the
bastion floor as the site was abandoned and broken items were simply tossed in a
convenient location.
Archaeological evidence suggests that the southeast corner was used as a
defensive bastion since the structure projects from the curtain walls of the fort in order to
provide flanking fire along the eastern and southern presidio walls. Excavations show
136

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

that the firing platform and cannon embrasures were well placed for defense. Loopholes
were likely present to provide musket fire when necessary. Aside from its physical form
and shape, the military function of the bastion is evidenced by the lead and canister shot
recovered as well the possible gunner’s pick. The lead shot exhibits no evidence of use
and was probably dropped. Some of the unidentified metal objects are likely gun parts or
other military items such as harness and bridle gear and other hardware.
Personal adornment items recovered within the bastion include probable militaryissue buttons and button covers, since similar buttons have been noted at other military
sites, (See Figure 80c-g), decorative buttons including one of carved shell (Figure 93),
glass beads (Figure 50), a heart-shaped brass pendant (Figure 80a), a button or cufflink
with a glass inset, and another unassociated glass inset (Figure 51). Such items are
typical at Spanish Colonial sites and may indicate differences in social status or military
rank. Voss (2008:296) notes, “colonial men engaged in subtle contests of social value
among themselves, through heightened attention to status displays in men’s dress. This is
evidenced both in slight differences of fabric and fasteners in their everyday uniforms
and in the elaboration of men’s dress during religious services in the Presidio chapel.”
The higher-status buttons, such as the carved shell button, the brass specimen with the
glass inset, and other decorative items could be evidence of the presence of an officer or
non-commissioned officer during daily activities within the bastion.
Evidence of eighteenth-century Catholicism is present in the form of possible
rosary beads and the brass heart-shaped pendant. In a religious sense, the heart
“represents the love of Christ and is extended through amuletic use to human love”
(Deagan 2002:100). As an amulet, it was used “presumably to inspire and protect love”
137

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

(Deagan 2002:100). The higa, or clenched fist, was commonly thought to ward off the
evil eye and offer protection to its bearer (Deagan 2002). The specimen found in the
bastion as part of the horse gear, probably was meant to protect the soldiers while on
mounted patrol duty.
What was not found in the bastion is just as telling as what was found. No
evidence was recovered of popular pastimes such as gambling or music, although items
such as dice, gaming pieces, and a mouth harp have been found in residential areas of the
presidio. A possible exception to this is the lead disk mentioned above, which could be a
gaming piece, but its intended purpose is unknown. The lack of evidence for popular
pastimes probably reinforces the idea that the bastion was strictly a military portion of the
fort, and that while on duty, soldiers were expected to maintain equipment and remain in
a state of preparedness. None of the personal adornment items can be strictly linked to a
particular gender. Wives likely brought meals to their husbands who were on duty and
possibly even dined with them. Therefore, the presence of women inside the bastion
cannot be discounted.
Modern activities such as artifact collecting and metal detecting have probably
also affected the interpretation of the artifactual record of the bastion. Large amounts of
twentieth- and twenty-first-century trash (See Appendix G) were recovered from surface
and near-surface excavation levels. Of the few modern items found in lower excavation
levels, almost all were small fragments of glass which could easily have been carried
deeper into the ground through rodent or root activity. Spanish artifacts were noted in all
excavation levels while virtually all the modern trash was recovered from surface
excavations.

CHAPTER VII
SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS
Synthesis
A synthesis of the documentary evidence and archaeological results provides a
more in-depth understanding of the southeast bastion at Presidio San Sabá and its
functionality as military architecture. This synthesis also allows a reconstruction of the
probable building sequence. Finally, since it was fully excavated, a description of the
bastion as it looked in 1767 and an analysis of how it functioned is proposed.
Historical documents indicate that the original construction at Presidio San Luis
de las Amarillas (San Sabá), as initiated by Parilla, consisted of a crude wooden stockade
with jacal structures and adobe bastions (Wolf 2005) (Figure 94). Whitehead (1996)
suggests that the first priority at many Franciscan and military sites was the construction
of the wooden palisade. Construction of houses and other structures, for example, could
not begin until the palisade was finished. A similar situation was likely experienced at
both the San Sabá mission and presidio. Whether the adobes discovered
archaeologically in the southeast bastion relate to this initial construction is unclear.
However, there is certainly a strong possibility that the two are related. Conceivably, the
rectangular adobe foundation was laid directly on the ground, but, more likely, a narrow
trench was excavated and the adobes placed there with mud mortar between. This
construction style created a stable foundation, with the walls of the trench preventing
shifting.

When Rábago took command, the original construction was in a dilapidated state.
Rábago soon began refortifying the presidio by building a strong wooden stockade with a
palisaded bastion on the northwest and southeast corners (Wolf 2005) (Figure 95). The
thick logs used for this construction were approximately four meters in length, with
almost one third of their length buried in the ground (Wolf 2005). According to Rábago,
the northwest bastion was circular and had a rammed-earth terreplein for the cannon
(Report by Rábago, October 19, 1764). In the southeast bastion, it appears that the
remainder of the ruined adobe structure was removed down to the foundation, and the
foundation of the north wall of the bastion was encased with thick logs. The builders
then apparently cut through the north wall trench to the inside of the east wall and then
followed the east wall adobe foundation to the corner. Apparently, the builders wished to
change the angle of the east wall slightly. The wider south and west walls, along with the
stone and rammed-earth platform, obscure the construction methods in this portion of the
bastion, as no adobes were found in these areas. Therefore it is difficult to determine the
exact size and shape of this original adobe structure.
Rábago writes that both the roof and the inner chamber of this bastion had room
for cannon and many soldiers (Wolf 2005). The roof was likely constructed of thick log
vigas covered with morillos, or short poles, laid perpendicular to the beams, a layer of
grass matting, and finally a coating of puddled adobe (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969)
(Figure 96). The vigas probably rested on shorter upright logs spaced accordingly in the
stockade walls that defined the bastion (Figure 95). Thus, the walls themselves then
supported the weight of the heavy roof.

This new wooden structure was short lived, because within months Rábago began
construction of a stone casa fuerte in the northwest corner, followed by the building of
stone and mud outer walls. Stone houses for the soldiers and their families were
constructed along the interiors of the north, east, and west walls of the presidio. The
south wall, once completed, was a substantial freestanding wall at this point in the fort’s
evolution. Rábago notes that the northwest bastion of thick logs with a terreplein was
encased in stone and mud mortar (Figure 97) to a height of five varas or 4.23 meters
(Report by Rábago, October 19, 1764). The reinforcement of the bastion served to avoid
the unsafe removal of the logs enclosing the tall rammed-earth terreplein by encasing it
with stone. Troneras, or cannon embrasures, were placed through the parapet of the
bastion. These resemble small windows and are shown on the section elevations
(profiles) of the north wall of the presidio drawn by both Lafora and Urrutia (1767)
(Figure 98).

This method of enclosing the wooden walls with stone does not appear to be used
in other areas of the fort. For example, no evidence of a builders’ trench was found to
date along the north, east, and west exterior walls. Therefore it seems likely that the
builders removed the thick logs from the trench they had excavated just months before,
widened it, and set the stone wall foundations inside. This scenario is supported by the
following examples. The width of frontier Spanish colonial buildings was determined by
the length of available vigas (Boyd 1974; Bunting 1976; Jones 1979; Kubler 1940,
Schuetz-Miller 1994; Whitehead 1996). The width of the houses within the casa muro,
or housing blocks, at San Sabá was approximately four meters (Walter et al. 2005). This
144

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

measurement is approximately the same length as the posts used in Rábago’s strong
wooden palisade. Given that the ends of the posts had been in the ground for only a few
months, they were presumably in good condition. Ivey notes that tree-ring dating of
some of the beams from the Spanish church at Pecos Pueblo indicated that the beams
were cut many years earlier and reused from a previous construction phase (Ivey 2005).
The reuse of materials was common on the Spanish frontier. Perhaps the strongest
evidence that the builders’ trenches were reused comes from the south wall of the
presidio. Dr. James E. Bruseth of the Texas Historical Commission detected evidence for
a palisade trench beneath the stone south wall during a magnetometer survey of the
southern portion of the fort conducted in November 2004 (Walter et al. 2005). While the
existence of the trench was not confirmed by excavation, the information collected from
the magnetometer survey does make the above scenario plausible. A similar case is made
for the southeast bastion as well. No evidence for a trench or post molds was detected
during excavations. Apparently, once the wooden posts were removed, the trench was
widened and used to set the stone foundations for the new stone construction. The
bastion roof beams were probably not entirely salvageable, and at least some new beams
were cut.
An especially strong roof was needed to support three cannon and the men
necessary to service them in addition to the heavy weight of the roofing materials
themselves. The motion of the crews and the recoil of the cannon, or the “live load” of
the roof, must also be taken into account (Bonde et al. 1993: 55; Gafford and Ivey
1988:390). Ivey (Gafford and Ivey 1988; Ivey 2005) has analyzed the roof load-bearing
capabilities at several colonial churches and other structures in New Mexico. The
145

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

spacing of the vigas, the thickness of the walls, and the use of corbels has much to do
with the load-bearing capacity of the roof (Ivey 1988). The bastion roof was likely quite
strong, with closely-spaced vigas, thick south and west walls, and possibly corbels
beneath the ends of the vigas at the ceiling. Such corbels were common both in New
Mexico and in Spanish fortified ranch architecture on the Rio Grande in South Texas
(Ivey 1988; Ivey 2005; Fleming 1998; George 1975). Another possibility is that the wall
top had sockets (Figure 99, 100) to accept the roof beams. The roof likely drained to the
south by means of canales, allowing the rainwater to drain down-slope to the river.

flat roof construction similar to that shown in Urrutia 1767 (from George 1975:40).

146

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

The exterior walls of the bastion were also quite strong in order to support the
roof. The structure was strengthened by the extra thickness of the south and west walls
and the stone buttress/drain system along the base of the west wall. The presence of the
platform along the south and west walls of the bastion also helped to distribute the load of
the roof. The fact that the adobe foundations of the original structure were apparently left
intact along the north and east walls of the bastion suggests that they served to buttress
these wall foundations. The raised parapets on the roof above the ends of the vigas also
had a strengthening effect on the walls by providing extra weight above the roofline (Ivey
1988; Bonde et al. 1993). Figure 101 illustrates a typical fortified ranch structure from
along the Rio Grande in South Texas. The raised parapet on the roof provided a safe
firing position as well as serving to strengthen the structure. Note the slightly pitched
roof for drainage and the troneras in each wall. This structure is very similar to those at
San Sabá as illustrated by Lafora and Urrutia.
Loopholes for escopetas or fusiles were surely present in the ground-floor walls of
the bastion. Rábago states that there was room inside for many “soldados escopeteros” in
addition to those men servicing the cannon (Report by Rábago, October 19, 1764). Such
loopholes were often the only openings in the exterior walls of fortified buildings
(Fleming 1998). Frequently these openings were nothing more than slits on the exterior
that were widely splayed on the interior allowing for a greater range of fire (Fleming
1998; George 1975) (Figure 102). Definitely proving the presence of such splayed
troneras at San Sabá is impossible, but their existence does seem probable. Heusinger
(1936:162) notes the presence of gun ports spaced four feet apart on the exterior east wall
of the presidio on his map of the ruins (Figure 22).

Documentary evidence suggests that there were cannon embrasures present in the
lower floor of the southeast bastion. Lafora states that there was an embrasure in the
north wall of the bastion flanking the east wall of the presidio, one on the west bastion
wall flanking the south wall of the presidio, and one facing the countryside that “has
never been of much usefulness” (Lafora to Rubí, August 12, 1767). Lafora is probably
referring to the fact that there was room for three cannon but only two present on the
ground floor at the time of the Rubí inspection in 1767. Rábago (Report by Rábago,
October 19, 1764) mentions that there were eight cannon in 1764, but in 1792 Arricivita
(1996) writes that one was lost in a campaign against the Norteños in 1766. Rábago
(December 23, 1766) notes that one cannon exploded during an attack in December, 1766
maiming three artillerymen. The embrasure on the northern wall is evidenced
archaeologically by a small gap approximately one meter wide in the foundation, flush

149

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

with the exterior east wall of the presidio. This opening exactly matches Lafora’s
description, stating that the embrasure was “flush with the east wall” and that it was an
opening from the ground level up (Lafora to Rubí, August 12, 1767). While it is not
known how tall the opening was, it was likely enough to give the gunner a clear view of
the entire length of the exterior of the east wall of the presidio. Heavy wooden lintels
probably were used as the ceilings of the troneras, with the wall continuing above them.
As mentioned in Chapter 6, the location of the west wall embrasure was probably near
the southwest corner of the bastion where the baked circular puddled adobe element was
located within the length of the wall. If the opening had been any further north, the
corral, which paralleled the south wall of the presidio, would have interfered with the
firing of the cannon. Lafora specifically states that the embrasure was flush with the
south wall; he must have been referring to the wooden corral wall (Lafora to Rubí,
August 12, 1767). The embrasure would have weakened the corner of the structure,
which is probably the reason for the reinforcing buttress on the west wall near that
opening.
The exact location of the embrasure facing the countryside is unknown, but it was
probably near the center of the east wall of the bastion, as there was no room on the
platform for recoil and servicing of more than one cannon. A narrow space existed
between the east wall of the bastion and the eastern edge of the platform. The space was
wide enough for a cannon, but with little room for the crew. Whether this embrasure,
wherever it may have been, was later filled in or kept open is unknown. No visible gap is
present in either the south or east walls of the bastion (Figure 103).

east and south walls.

The platform along the south and west walls of the bastion is known only through
the archaeology. No mention of this platform is found in any document discovered thus
far. The documents and maps concerning San Sabá were produced by military men who
understood the need for level firing platforms for cannon. Although such platforms are
almost always found in fortifications, they are rarely mentioned in military documents.
One rare mention of a cannon platform by a Spanish official is a statement by Governor
Andrés de Arriola in reference to Presidio Santa María de Galve in 1706. As translated
151

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

in Bense’s book on the archaeology of that presidio, Arriola states, “…and that only the
parapet ought to be terrepleined for the defense of the infantry and so the cannons can
fight through the loopholes that they have on their traverses defending the curtain walls.
Therefore, the gun platforms that the cannons always have to have were raised up so that
they can be well handled” (2003:45). Such platforms were often made of wooden planks
and were depicted in many eighteenth-century plan maps of open bastions or cannon
batteries (Duffy 2006; James and Stotz 1958; Stotz 1985). In more permanent
fortifications, platforms were often constructed of rammed earth or stone.
Archaeological evidence of stone cannon platforms was found in bastions at several
presidios or related sites, even though they are not mentioned in documents. These
include Mission San Lorenzo, Presidio San Vicente, Presidio San Carlos, and Presidio La
Bahía at its final location at Goliad, Texas (Ivey 1990; O’Connor 2001; Tunnell and
Newcomb 1969).
The cannon at Presidio San Sabá, according to both Rábago and Lafora, were
small, “caliber de 3,” or 3-pounders (Rábago 1764; Lafora 1767). Cannon referred to as
3-pounders fired a 3-pound projectile. According to Brinkerhoff and Chamberlain
(1972), a typical 3-pounder cannon on the northern frontier of New Spain was bronze,
cast in Mexico or the Philippines, about 38 inches in length, and weighed approximately
132 pounds. At the time of the Rubí inspection tour, there were seven such cannon at
San Sabá (Lafora to Rubí, August 12, 1767).
Whether the carriages for these cannon were manufactured elsewhere and
imported to San Sabá, or if they were built by local soldiers/carpenters is unknown.

152

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Historical evidence suggests that many such carriages were manufactured locally by the
soldiers themselves (Schuetz-Miller 1994). Lafora does say that many of the carriages
lacked iron trunnion clamps and that some cannon had broken trunnions (Lafora to Rubí,
August 12, 1767). As iron was fairly scarce on the frontier, and it is not known if there
was a full-time blacksmith at San Sabá or if a soldier filled this role, Lafora’s statements
are probably accurate. The carriages probably consisted of the four-wheeled garrison
type with wooden wheels and very little ironwork (Brinkerhoff and Chamberlain 1972;
Manucy 1985) (Figure 104). Rawhide cords could be used in place of iron trunnion
clamps or if the cannon were lacking trunnions (Whitehead 1996).

Figure 104: Bronze 2-pound cannon on original garrison carriage (from Brinkerhoff
and Chamberlain 1972:134), showing design of typical all-wood carriage construction.

The interior chamber of the southeast bastion is described by Lafora in his report
to Rubí dated August 12, 1767:
…in the interior space, of three embrasures or cat holes, two are flush with the
curtain wall at ground level, and the other in the direction of the countryside, that
has never been of major usefulness; because the smoke is trapped in the short
153

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

space of the tower and the low ceiling so that after the first shot the battery
remains useless.
Although there were three cannon embrasures, two doorways (one from the guardhouse
and one from the corral), and an unknown number of small loopholes, the interior space
of the southeast bastion was cramped and probably dark. Lighting came in the form of
candles, lanterns, or braziers, which could also be used for heating. Gunpowder was
often stored in bastions in large quantities. Therefore, the presence of a hearth was
unlikely, and indeed, none was found archaeologically. Fires were probably in contained
vessels such as braziers or lanterns. Given the large quantities of animal bone found, at
least some cooking was probably done inside the bastion, but most food was prepared
elsewhere and consumed within the bastion. Presumably, there was some sort of rotation
of guard duty, so long hours were spent inside the bastion or in the adjacent guardhouse.
The battery on the roof is described by Lafora in his report to Rubí dated August
12, 1767 in the following way: “The badly-constructed embrasures leave the artilleryman
unprotected from the feet to the head; since it is nothing more than an opening from top
to bottom in the parapet, and they are badly placed with only one flanking the curtains.”
Noted on Lafora’s key to the plan map is the presence of three cannon on the roof of the
southeast bastion. Thus, it appears that there were also three fixed embrasures on the
roof, only one of which flanked one of the exterior walls. Unfortunately, Lafora was not
more specific as to which wall was flanked. Probably the flanked wall was the south
wall, as the horses in the adjoining corral were often prime targets during an attack (Barr
2007; Jackson and Foster 1995; Wade 2003).

154

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Lafora’s wording implies that these embrasures were simply openings, or slits, in
the raised parapet on the roof, which was the most common design for cannon
embrasures in the eighteenth century (see Duffy 2006; Stotz 1985). Lafora does not
mention the height of the parapet. The height was probably anywhere from one to oneand-a-half varas (0.85 to 1.3 meters), since he states that the cannon crew was
unprotected only when standing in the embrasures during the loading of the cannon. The
slits, or embrasures, are different in design from those in the circular northwest bastion or
the lower floor of the southeast bastion. Lafora even uses different terminology when
describing the two sets of embrasures. For those in the northwest bastion and lower floor
of the southeast bastion, he uses the term “gateras” or “cat holes,” a Spanish nautical
term for the window-like embrasures for ships’ cannon, whereas for the southeast bastion
roof embrasures he writes “…pues no son mas que una abertura de arriba abajo en el
Parapeto” or “since they are no more than an opening from top to bottom in the parapet”
(Lafora 1767). Abertura is also translated as “slit.”
Access to the roof was probably by means of a ladder. No mention is made of
how the roof was accessed in any known document, but since there was no room for a
ramp or stairs, a ladder seems probable. While it is not known if there was access to the
roof from the interior of the bastion, it does seem unlikely since it would tend to weaken
the roof. Access was either from the interior of the corral that ran along the south wall or
from a ladder onto the roof of the adjacent guardhouse and then to the roof of the bastion.
The cannon on the roof were likely pulled to the top with ropes. Probably, the tube was
removed from the carriage, the carriage disassembled as much as possible, and then the
components pulled to the rooftop in separate pieces. An interesting account involving
155

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

soldiers from the San Sabá garrison stationed at Mission San Lorenzo is found in the
Apostolic Chronicle of Juan Domingo Arricivita written in 1792. The incident took place
in 1766 during an attack on the mission by the Norteños:
They [the Norteños] attacked with such determination that they reached the walls
of the enclosure. If the soldiers had been more expert in the use of their weapons
and the cannon, they could have done great damage to them with the grapeshot
and the shotguns….But when the soldiers noticed that they fled from the sides
near the stone mortars [small cannon], they lowered one in order to fire from an
embrasure. This rendered it useless because they were then unable to put it back
on the gun carriage; thus the bastion was unprotected and the Indians fired
unceasingly against it. [Arricivita 1996:85]
This explanation describes how cannon were probably moved on and off a rooftop, even
in the heat of battle.
Much of the confusion regarding the appearance of the southeast bastion is
perpetuated by historians using poor translations. For example, Moorhead (1975:170)
writes, based on a poor translation from Brown (1924):
The presidio was a square enclosure with small circular towers at the northwest
and southeast angles. The tower on the southeast corner did not protrude
sufficiently to defend the adjacent walls with flanking fire from its summit, and its
partial rooftop parapet was so badly constructed of unmortared stones that enemy
musketballs could penetrate it as if it were a sieve….There were three cannons on
the upper floor of this tower but the parapets were too low and badly constructed
to protect their personnel.
Only through a combination of careful reading of original documents and archaeology is
a better understanding of the appearance and function of this bastion possible (Figures
105, 106).

Despite Lafora’s comments to the contrary, it seems that the southeast bastion, as
well as the one in the northwest corner of Presidio San Sabá, was quite capable of
effective defense of the fort. The presidio was attacked on several occasions. During
these conflicts, the artillery batteries, located in both bastions, played key roles in
warding off the attackers. When Rábago initially took command of the garrison, he was
not at all impressed with the artillery skills of his men, saying that “because of their
stupidity” they could not service the cannon properly (Wolf 2005:51). Toward the end of
his tenure as captain at San Sabá, however, he had the opportunity to praise their actions
in official reports (Rábago 1767, Tunnell and Newcomb 1969).

158

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Plains Indian groups rarely attacked fortified places, but the Norteños and their
Comanche allies were known to have done so on several occasions, many of them
involving the San Sabá and San Lorenzo mission/presidio complex (Arricivita 1996, Barr
2007, Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). The Norteños’ preferred method of battle was to
attempt to draw the soldiers from their fortified positions into the open and engage them
through deception or other means. When this tactic failed, direct assaults were
sometimes attempted. During such assaults, there was usually very little warning for the
Spanish (Barr 2007). According to documentary sources, Norteño warriors were wellarmed with firearms, bows and arrows, and lances, with some on horseback and others on
foot (Arricivita 1996, Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). Spanish participants spoke of
mounted warriors circling the fortifications, firing their weapons, while those on foot
attempted to reach the walls in order to gain entrance by either climbing over or mining
under the walls (Arricivita 1996; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). In such cases, flanking
fire from the bastions was employed. For this reason, proper flanking angles along the
curtain walls were considered important. As Lafora pointed out in his report (Lafora to
Rubí, August 12, 1767), both bastions at San Sabá improperly flanked one of the nearby
walls. The southeast bastion flanked the east wall to some extent, but fire was impeded
by the entrenchment that angled from the east wall to the river. The northwest bastion
flanked the north wall but not at a proper angle, and along the west wall cannon fire was
hindered by the cattle corral constructed along a portion of the wall.
Despite Lafora’s opinions to the contrary, the artillery at San Sabá was quite
effective in repelling at least two direct attacks in 1766 and 1767. Mission San Lorenzo,

159

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

which maintained a force of 30 soldiers from San Sabá, was also attacked on two separate
occasions in 1766, and each time the artillery drove off the attackers (Report by Rábago,
January 29, 1767; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). Following one attack at Presidio San
Sabá in December of 1766, Rábago discusses an incident in which one of his
artillerymen, Pedro Miñon, lost an arm, and two other soldiers were permanently disabled
when a cannon tube exploded while defending against this assault. Rábago blamed the
incident on faulty gunpowder and requested that all of the stock from that powder
shipment be replaced, in addition to ordering “ocho cientas valas de fierro; y la
correspondente de valas menuda o metralla” or “eight hundred iron balls; and the
corresponding [number] of small balls or grapeshot,” for 3 pounders (Rábago to the
Marqués de Croix, December 23, 1766). The order was supposed to come from the
factory in Mexico via the Presidio of Santa Rosa. Rábago also requested “cinchas de
fierro” or “iron clamps” to repair two wooden gun carriages (Rábago to the Marqués de
Croix, December 23, 1766). Apparently these items still had not arrived at the time of
the Rubí inspection of San Sabá in the summer of 1767 (Lafora to Rubí, August 12,
1767). Evidently Rábago was in the process of replenishing or replacing artillery
supplies when the Rubí tour occurred. Rubí apparently already knew he was going to
recommend relocation of San Sabá; therefore Lafora and Urrutia probably exaggerated
the poor conditions found at the presidio (Brown 1924:32). While obviously not of the
quality of fortifications the inspectors were familiar with in Europe, the Caribbean, or
other parts of the New World, the fortifications at San Sabá were of sufficient strength to
fend off several direct assaults by Native Americans.

160

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Ultimately the Norteños achieved success by cutting off the supplies to the
garrison and wearing down the Spanish by constant raiding and assaults. These attacks
along with other global events, the results of the cession of Louisiana to Spain, and
changes to Bourbon frontier policy (See Serrano Alvarez and Kuethe 2007 and Weber
2005), rendered the San Sabá garrison useless in its present location. Based on Rubí’s
recommendations, the garrison found a new role as one of the Presidios of the Line at its
new location at San Vicente, on the Rio Grande. This relocation came as a result of the
Regulations of 1772 issued by Charles III (Brinkerhoff and Faulk 1965).
Conclusions
At the outset of this study, the following research questions were posed:
1. Which plan map is a more accurate representation of the southeast bastion?
2. What was the construction sequence of this bastion?
3. What did the bastion look like in its final form?
4. What was life like for the soldiers on duty within the bastion?
5. How effective was the bastion as a defensive structure?
First, in determining which Spanish plan map is most accurate, the various maps
were compared to the results of the archaeological investigation. Based on this
comparison, Rábago’s 1764 plan map is more correct than those of Lafora or Urrutia,
although none of them are truly accurate. The size of the bastion on all three maps is
similar, but the shapes are incorrect. Rábago does not appear to have had any training in
engineering, so it is interesting that his map best corresponds to what was actually built,
based on the archaeological remains. Urrutia, while not a member of the Spanish Royal

Corps of Engineers, did have training as a draftsman and was chosen by Rubí to draw the
official maps of each presidio (Fireman 1977; M. Weber 1986). However, Urrutia clearly
made errors in other plan maps from the Rubí tour. For example, he made a
miscalculation in scale at Presidio Los Adaes (Ivey 1981) and a similar mistake at Santa
Fe (Badner 2008), and he mislabeled a portion of his map of San Antonio de Béxar (Ivey
1981). Loren (1999:165) notes that Urrutia may have purposely distorted his rendering
of Presidio Los Adaes to “fit the official imaginings” of his audience. Weber (1986)
points out the overall accuracy of Urrutia’s work, but Badner (2008), in her analysis of
Urrutia’s map of Santa Fe, says that his work has been shown to be “accurate but not
precise.” In other words, some of Urrutia’s work has been called into question. Jackson
(1995; 1998) demonstrates that Lafora copied Urrutia’s work on the general map of the
frontier and then took credit for the entire work. Conceivably, Lafora duplicated
Urrutia’s original map of Presidio San Sabá and repeated Urrutia’s error in the angle of
the north wall of the bastion, which threw off all subsequent angles. In the case of San
Sabá, only by comparing the maps to the layout of the bastion discovered
archaeologically were these errors exposed (See Figure 107). The footprint of the bastion
revealed archaeologically indicates a slightly acute angle between the east wall of the
presidio and the north wall of the bastion. Rábago’s plan map shows this angle as being
90 degrees, while both Urrutia and Lafora drew obtuse angles in this location. Perhaps
Rábago’s map reflects his conception of the bastion as being rectangular, although the
difficulty of building 90-degree angles without proper training and equipment resulted in
an irregular quadrangle, common in vernacular architecture.

d: Footprint based on archaeological investigations 2005-2007).

The second question concerns the building sequence of the southeast bastion.
Archaeological evidence supports the documentary sources in asserting that the original
southeast bastion, built in 1757 by Parilla, was constructed of adobe. This is evidenced
by the adobe blocks lining the interior of the north wall of the bastion as well as the
adobes discovered along the exterior of the east bastion wall. Based on the alignment of
163

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

these adobes, the original bastion was roughly square in shape, but it is unknown if it was
a single-story or a two-story structure. According to Rábago (Wolf 2005), the original,
dilapidated, palisade wall of the presidio was replaced with a strong wall of thick logs, as
were the bastion walls, in 1761. No evidence of this wooden palisaded bastion was
discovered archaeologically. However, Rábago’s wooden fortifications were in existence
for only several months and were replaced with stone walls. If the soldiers removed the
upright logs to be incorporated into the new roofs, and reused the builder’s trench to set
the stone foundations for the new walls, little or no evidence of this wooden bastion
would remain. The stone construction is best represented archaeologically, and it is from
these remains that the size and shape of the bastion are known.
The third question focuses on the appearance of the bastion in its final form.
Documentary evidence indicates the bastion walls were approximately 4.2 meters tall.
The structure consisted of two floors, the lower floor with three embrasures (although
only two cannon were present at the time of the Rubí inspection) and the roof with three
or four embrasures (Lafora to Rubí, August 12, 1767). Archaeological investigations of
the foundations indicate that the bastion was roughly square and approximately 6 meters
to a side. Excavations revealed the presence of one tronera flanking the presidio east
wall, a doorway between the bastion and the adjacent guardhouse, and another doorway
between the bastion and the horse corral. Additionally, only through archaeology is the
presence of the L-shaped cannon platform along the west and south interior bastion walls
known. The narrow western portion of the platform likely served as a ramp on which to
roll cannon onto the southern firing platform. The thick foundations of the west and
south walls are evidence of the bastion’s ability to support a heavy roof and the live load
164

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

of the cannon and their crews. The buttress/drain near the southwest corner provided
additional support to the west wall where a presumed cannon tronera was located and
helped to prevent water from pooling at the base of the foundation. No modifications to
the southeast bastion appear to have taken place after 1767, based on the archaeological
investigations.
The next question addresses what life was like for the soldiers on duty within the
bastion. Because bastions were strictly military areas within fortifications, soldiers were
expected to be alert and prepared while on duty. Therefore, pastimes within the bastion
were not recreational but were constructive. The presence in the bastion of a large
number of used, broken, and discarded gunflints and the gunworm indicates that soldiers
spent much time cleaning and maintaining their weapons. The large quantities of
debitage and chert core fragments are clearly the byproducts of gunflint and stone tool
manufacture. As discussed previously, no lithic tools were found in excavation levels
that did not also contain diagnostic Spanish colonial materials, so identifying any of the
lithic materials as definitely of Native American origin is problematic (see Appendix G).
The archaeological evidence from the southeast bastion at San Sabá as well as at a variety
of other Spanish colonial sites (see Ivey 1983, Shafer 2006, Tunnell and Newcomb 1969,
Villalobos 2003) indicates that the Spanish were likely manufacturing their own gunflints
and tools. Considering the relative shortage of metal on the frontier (Norment 2007),
stone tools provided a viable substitute for metal implements. Such stone tools had many
uses, including cutting, splitting, and scraping hides and leather in the maintenance and
repair of saddles, harnesses, and other horse gear. Several bridle and ring bit fragments

165

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

such as chains, buckle tongues, rings, jinglers, and other related hardware are further
evidence of horse equipment maintenance within the bastion.
Most meals were likely prepared by the soldiers in residential areas of the fort and
delivered to the bastion. However, some food was likely cooked or heated within the
structure, using contained fires in vessels such as braziers due to the risk of explosion.
Although no sherds of such a vessel were recovered, indirect evidence of a brazier or
similar container remained in the form of the circle of baked puddled adobe on the
surface of the platform. Heat from the contained fire above the base of a brazier likely
baked the adobe to its brick-like hardness. Soldiers probably prepared at least some of
their food within the bastion and obviously ate many meals there, disposing of the food
waste by simply tossing it on the floor and trampling it in over time. The faunal remains
recovered during bastion excavations indicate that many meals consisted of beef,
supplemented with, fish, and small quantities of freshwater mussels since some of these
remains comprise a portion of the faunal assemblage. Wild game likely supplemented
the diet of the soldiers as well although a complete faunal analysis has not yet been
conducted. The distribution of food remains, lithic material, and other artifacts around
the base of the cannon platform indicates that the raised area also served as a bench used
while dining, flintknapping, and maintaining weapons and equipment.
Finally, this thesis addresses the effectiveness of the bastion as a defensive
structure. Based on the archaeological and documentary evidence, the bastion was a
much more effective defensive structure than Rubí or Lafora acknowledged. While it is
true that the fortifications at San Sabá were woefully inadequate by European standards
of the eighteenth century, they were more than sufficient to defend against Native
166

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

Americans lacking artillery. The soldiers, using artillery and musket fire from the
bastions, were able to repel several direct attacks over a period of years. Other than the
strongest evidence of cannon in the bastion, the platform, the only direct archaeological
evidence of cannon recovered from bastion excavations is a single example of lead
canister shot and a probable gunner’s pick. However, several cannonballs have been
discovered to date by local Menard residents, some reportedly from across the river.
Further investigation of the area immediately outside the bastion and within the range of
musket and cannon fire is needed to obtain evidence of combat activity involving the
southeast bastion. As shown archaeologically, the bastion was much better constructed
than Lafora writes in the report to Rubí (August 12, 1767) and did flank the east and
south walls of the presidio properly. The tronera that flanked the east wall, discovered
during excavations, and the presumed tronera that flanked the south wall on the cannon
platform, were positioned correctly to provide flanking fire along the east curtain wall
and the south corral wall. The discrepancy between the effectiveness of the bastion based
on the archaeology and its ineffectiveness as reported by the Rubí inspection indicates the
agenda of Rubí in recommending the presidio for relocation. Therefore, the deficiencies
of the bastion and other fortifications at San Sabá were purposely exaggerated for geopolitical reasons.
As this thesis demonstrates, archaeology can be a powerful tool in the analysis of
historical documents, In the case of San Sabá, the contradictory documentary records in
the forms of plan maps and descriptions are only properly understood only when
compared with the archaeological record. In this way, light is shed on obscure aspects of

167

Texas Tech University, Bennett R. Kimbell, December 2008

the Spanish colonial frontier experience. In the case of San Sabá, it centers on a single
corner of an isolated outpost on the northern frontier of New Spain.

made up of the same [material] and has three rooms [which are] very ample and
decorated with various figures of stone. One of them is the house of the captain, also of
stone, but it has a height of nine and one half varas and five rooms of thick walls below,
and seven eighths [of a vara in thickness] above. Concerning this building, it has another
two rooms in a north/south [direction]; one of them serves as an infirmary and the other
as a kitchen. In between it looks on to an ample patio having rooms of nine varas and
five and one half deep, equally made to the aforementioned casafuerte.

The principal gate of this Presidio is toward the west, and it looks to a room that is
thirteen varas wide and six and one half deep, that is the principal guard [house]. And
toward the east adjoining it is another room, of rubble [construction] and decently made,
that is seven varas wide and six deep. In this place is the chapel where the holy sacrifice
of the mass is celebrated temporarily and continuously.
Enclosing the said patio; two rooms of 19 varas wide and six deep and equally
made to the rest, stand before the wall to the casafuerte. One of them serves as the office
and the other as a passage to the door to the east. Adjacent are two [rooms?] for the
handling of part of [?] the inside of said wall.
In the north corner is a circular baluarte that has an area of 26 varas constructed
of a terrepleined stockade and lined afterward with stone and mud which has a height of
five varas with its corresponding embrasures for cannon, and it is capable of handling
four of these, with benefit. Adjacent is the principle body of guards in the corner of the
east, of sufficient height where is kept at night one squad of soldiers with muskets. In the
south is another baluarte, a square that has a height of five varas and a width of five and
one half; also with its embrasures for all directions, also capable of handling four cannon.
And in the west corner another locked square [building] well sufficient where is kept the
same soldiers with muskets, at night. And because the said three curtain walls along the
east, north, and west, are occupied with forty four [houses] for the housing of the families
[they are] perfectly situated for all to live within the curtain walls. Between the stockade
and [south] wall there is a space that is seven varas deep with a door to the baluarte of
the south that serves as a corral.
It is certain then that the aforementioned material construction is unique and that
it is considered special among the Presidios of these Kingdoms, thus in its strength it is in
good arrangement for security and defense against the enemy. The unique materials of
stone and wood were found not very distant in consideration of the costs of the
transportation and cutting. Accordingly, all the recorded parts like the casafuerte and
houses of the families have seventy five shaped beams of [proper] length and 453 short
poles, as well as the planks and other wood for the principal gate and other [wood]
pertaining to the abovementioned [structures]. In view of this, and because during the
building of the above mentioned casafuerte, granary, kitchen, guardhouse, and chapel
[everyone was required] to help daily. Some 2700 cartloads of stone were quarried and
transported. The newly made construction of the rooms and houses of the families,
accordingly, does not have reason [to be] of the type of massive [stones] of the said walls.

My conjecture is that the past [construction], is worthy of major estimation and
consideration of the expenditures indispensable for paying for the carpenters that built the
doors and windows, the stock of nails, oxen irons, and the steel that was used in the tools
that are necessary for said cutting of wood, and the extraction of the stone. The
headquarters, in the regulation of security the useful materials for their attention and
esteem, agree.
To finish their inspection, passing to the dams that are done for the extraction of
water; [the inspectors] also found three dams that sound out necessary to unite a shortcut
with arroyos and the principal cut of the river that is necessary to raise more [water]
regarding irrigating much more land. And [they found] it is not necessary to move the
acequia that was made secure by the aforementioned extraction and its inclination to
possess the land that is an attempt to be of some benefit to go near to the Presidio for
their attention, despite the assaults of the enemy of this land, of one and another band of
the river, for farming of wheat, as of corn, and other seeds, that the great extraction of
water, is one hundred [varas?] that alerted the said officials, that the result was of great
benefit to the troops that exist, and [civilian] residents that may in the future form this
Presidio.
This is my declaration that the aforementioned officials have looked around at the
aforementioned material construction and extraction of water, that with all of their best
knowledge and understanding, without deceitful phrase, without coercion and bitterness,
abundantly swear before God our Lord and forming a Sign of the Holy Cross, and sign
with me, said Captain and my assistants that with that said act of giving faith.

Most Excellent Lordship,
Among those previously mentioned documents that accompany [this letter] for
Your Excellency to examine [are also documents] to assure the depositors that the
powder received in this year is of bad quality. For lacking activity, corresponding to it
being thin, it is conjectured to suffer the defect of the [over] abundance of charcoal. For
that [during] the experience of operation, after [only] three shots, dirties the chambers
and fills the vents of the cannons. At the same time, the crudely manufactured carriages
were damaged and are not fit to determine levels and other necessary measurements.
They also lack the iron clamps that they must have in order to hold them [the cannon].
This is as much of the particulars I have that to give notice to the sovereignty of Your
Excellency when in view of all my service to take the foresight that you will have of your
superior pleasure [that] always was the better.
[May] our Lord guard the most important life of Your Excellency in the highest
zenith for as many years as this kingdom needs.

mas que una abertura de arriba abajo en el Parapeto, y por su

My very dear Sir,
I was well informed of the order of the most excellent Señor Viceroy and that of
Your Lord, communicated to me in your letter of the 26th of July just passed, that I
present my report containing the advantages and disadvantages of Presidio San Sabá. I
will say in my compliance the following: …
The defects of the enclosure are in totally trusting the defense to the two small
towers, P and R, incapable of properly covering the curtain walls, because of the
smallness of their flanks, as I have been saying; and much less [capable] of defending
itself, since it does not flank two parts at all. The enemy are able to be entirely sheltered
at the foot of the contour of the tower R, and in the other, in the intermediate [space] of
three embrasures or cat holes that, alas, on the lower floor, two are flush with the curtain
wall at ground level and the other in the direction of the countryside, that has never been
of major usefulness. Smoke is trapped in the cramped space of the interior of the tower,
combined with the low elevation of the ceiling, that at the first shot leaves the battery
useless.
The badly constructed embrasures leave the artilleryman unprotected from the
feet to the head, since they are no more than an opening [or slit] from top to bottom in the
parapet, and because of its bad directions, covers only one part of the curtains.
All of the curtain walls are without parapets and the towers are low and badly
constructed as is all of the construction [of the fort].
…
[May] our Lord keep Your Lordship for many years.
Presidio de San Antonio de Bejar
12 August, 1767
I Kiss the Hand of Your Lordship.
Your most Secure and Affectionate Servant,
Don Nicolas de Laffora [sic]
