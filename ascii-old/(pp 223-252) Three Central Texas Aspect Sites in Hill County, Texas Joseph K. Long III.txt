Three Central Texas Aspect Sites
in Hill County, Texas
JOSEPH K. LONG III
Introduction
winter of 1957 and the spring of 1958, several Dallas
and Fort Worth amateur archeo!ogists carried out excavations at Buzzard, Little Buzzard, and Forrester "caves" (Texas quadrangle numbers 26D7-12, 26D7-i4, and 26D7-i5 respectively) in Hill County,
Texas. Robert E. Forrester of Fort Worth did all the work on Forrester and Buzzard Caves; Loyd Harper of Dallas and the writer were the
principal excavators of Little Buzzard Cave. Other excavators included
Mrs. Loyd Harper, Loyd Harper, Jr., Jan Owen Harper, R. King
Harris, and Lester Wilson, all of Dallas, and Isabelle Lobdell and Roy
Padget of Fort Worth.

Acknowledgments
The above-mentioned excavators have been helpful in providing
the writer with artifacts found and with detailed notes taken during
excavation. Forrester and Harris have made helpful suggestions as to
analysis of materials.
In 1947 and 1950 Dr. R. L. Stephenson of the Smithsonian Institution conducted excavations in the Whitney Reservoir. Buzzard Cave
was one of the sites excavated, and the writer is grateful for comments
from Dr. Stephenson on the site and its cuhural analysis.
Mr. Edward B. Jelks, University of Texas research archeologist, has
provided helpful criticism regarding the interpretation of the three
sites and of their relations to the Archaic and Neo-American cultures
of central Texas.
Dr. E. Mort Davis, University of Texas research archeologist, has
corresponded with the writer constantly, giving him much-needed
advice toward the preparation of this paper.

Excavation and Stratigraphy
All the earth excavated from the three shelters was sifted through
screens of quarter-inch mesh.
BUZZARD CAVE

No attempt was made either to plot a grid system or to collect by
depths at Buzzard Cave. Because the site had been badly disturbed by
looters subsequent to the completion of Stephenson’s work there, it
appeared that close controls were unnecessary; consequently no attempt was made to record either the horizontal or vertical location of
the artifacts found. No stratigraphic zoning of the deposits was observed.
At Buzzard Cave, Stephenson (1949) reported finding two triangular dart points, one dart point of the Martindale type, 30 Perdiz
type arrow points, five Cliffton arrow points, seven Alba arrow points,
and two arrow points identified as "Tahuaconi" type.
LITTLE BUZZARD CAVE

Because of its superficial appearance, Little Buzzard Cave was originally thought to consist of a cultural layer only about three inches
deep. Excavation thus proceeded to some degree before it was discovered that the deposits were of sufficient depth to warrant vertical controls. Eventually excavation was done by six-inch levels, excluding
the top layer of fallen rock. Of the nine artifacts (3.0% of total artifacts) found below the upper two six-inch levels, all occurred immediately below the second six-inch level except in three cases: the
two burials, occurring 18 inches below the top of the cultural layer,
and a mano (Fig. 9, A) occurring 20 inches below. The only further
indications of occupation at these lower levels were scattered flint
flakes, river pebbles, flecks of charcoal, and snail shells (Bulirnulus
sp.).
No stratigraphic distinctions between any of the arrow point types
were discerned, nor was there any vertical separation between dart
points and arrow points. There are several factors that might possibly
explain the failure to recognize any stratification of artifact classes or
types--(1) the shallowness of the deposits, (2) the fact that vertical
provenience of artifacts was not recorded during much of the excavation, and (3) irregularities in the zoning.
The coSordinate method used in excavating Little Buzzard Cave
(Fig. 1) follows standard mathematical procedure (May, 1952: 113-

of the layer of rock fallen from the top as indicated in Fig. 1 is slightly
exaggerated. In actuality, it averaged only three inches in thickness
and was of negligible thickness in some places.
FORRESTER CAVE

No stratigraphy was observed at Forrester Cave. Bedrock was not far
beneath the surface, and the occupational layer was only 8 to 10 inches
thick. The shelter was dug in the hope of obtaining human skeletal
material to supplement the present scanty information on the physical
type of the Central Texas Aspect peoples. Forrester Cave is a small
rock shelter 14 feet in length, six feet in depth (front to rear), and with_
a maximum ceiling height of six feet.

Description o[ the Arti[acts
CERAMICS

Buzzard Cave
Vessel I. Fourteen sherds (Fig. 2, A) of a vessel identified as type
Leon Plain were recovered. The vessel had an oral diameter of 22 +
1 cm, and there were two suspension (?) holes 1.5 cm. below the lip.
The paste is black, and the sherds indicate a wall thickness of from
4.5 to 5.5 ram.
Vessel II. Another Leon Plain vessel is represented by 17 reddishbrown sherds (Fig. 2~ H), one of them pierced by a hole showing rotational drill marks. This hole was probably for crack-lacing, although it may have been a suspension hole. The sherds are all 5 to 6
ram. thick. The paste characteristics of Vessels I and II correspond to
those cited for the Leon Plain type by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954:
386).
Vessel III. Five sherds of a Holly Fine Engraved vessel (Fig. 2, C,
E)) were found, thickness ranging from 3~ to 5 ram. Paste color is
dark brown.
Vessel 1V. One sherd (Fig. 2, B) is similar to those of Vessel III in
texture~ temper, color, and finish, but the engraved design is more
typical of the Sanders Engraved type than of Holly Fine Engraved
(Suhm, Krieger~ and Jelks~ 1954: Pls. 34~ 35, 61). On the basis of surface finish and fineness of engraving, however, the sherds is tentatively designated as type Holly Fine Engraved. Oral diameter of the
vessel is estimated to have been 9 ± 2 cm. The sherd is 6.5 mm. thick.
Vessel V. One sherd (Fig. 2, E) was similar in paste characteristics
to the lighter-colored Holly Fine Engraved sherds. A crude attempt
was made to scratch a design on the vessel after a smooth finish had
been applied and the vessel had been fired. These rough scratches were
later filled with ocher. The sherd is 5 ram. thick.
Vessel VI. Four sherds possibly of the Goose Creek Plain type were
recovered, the identification having been made mostly on the basis of
sand tempering. These sherds are all about ram. thick. The writer
had originally recognized the possibility that these might be Goose
Creek Plain sherds but had rejected the identification because of the
improbability of this coastal type being found in central Texas. Since
that time, he has read Suhm’s discussion (Suhm, 1957: 32) of the
possibility of (1) cultural affiliation, (2) contemporaneity, and (3)
intergrading of the Leon Plain and Goose Creek Plain types. She

pointed out that the Galveston Bay Focus (of which Goose Creek Plain
is considered diagnostic) shares arrow point types and other traits with

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

the Central Texas Aspect. Similar sandy-textured sherds reported at
the Blum Rockshelter (Jelks, 1953: 205) were also associated with the
Central Texas Aspect.
Vessel VII. One sherd (Fig. 2, F), 7 ram. in thickness, has been
identified as type Dunkin Incised (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954:
268-269).
Vessel VIII. One sherd (Fig. 3, G) of a second Dunkin Incised vessel
was recovered. This sherd is 8 ram. thick. R. K. Harris, who has examined the sherds, thinks that Vessels VII and VIII might possibly
both be of the Weches Fingernail Impressed type (Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks, 1954: 364-365).
Little Buzzard Cave
Vessel I. The two sherds of this vessel were tentatively identified as
Holly Fine Engraved on the basis of collective paste characteristics,
although no engraving was present. Thickness is 5.5 to 6.5 ram.
Vessel II. This is tentatively identified as Sanders Engraved on the
basis of paste, carinated vessel form, and an engraved line (Fig. 5, H)
~)n the one sherd recovered. These characteristics agree with the type
description in An Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology
.(Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 352-555).
Vessel III. One sherd, 7 to 8 ram. thick, is identified as type Goose
Creek Plain.
Vessel IV. Three sherds (Fig. 5, J, note differential firing), 5 to 8
ram. thick, were identified as Goose Creek Plain.
Vessel V. One sherd (Fig. 5, I), 6 to 8 ram. thick, is probably Holly
Fine Engraved.
Vessel VI. One sherd with grit and bone temper is eroded beyond
identification. It is 3 to 4 ram. thick.
Discussion. No pottery was found at Forrester Cave. The sherds recovered and identified from the other two sites seem to indicate four
possible sources of pottery: (1) locally made wares, represented by
Leon Plain (and possibly by Goose Creek Plain) ; (2) Galveston Bay
Focus trade from the Texas coastal area as indicated by Goose Creek
Plain pottery; (3) trade with Alto (or possibly Gahagan) Focus from
east Texas as indicated by Holly Fine Engraved, Dunkin Incised,
and/or Weches Fingernail Impressed; (4) Sanders Focus trade from
the Red River area of northeastern Texas as indicated by a single
sherd tentatively identified as Sanders Engraved.

ARROW POINTS
Arrow points were the most numerous class of artifacts found at
each of the three shelters. The identification of arrow point types was
based on the descriptive criteria set forth by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks
(1954), except in the case of the Reed and Washita types, which were
identified on the basis of type descriptions in Guide to the Identification of Certain American Indian Projectile Points (Bell, 1958).

Perdiz Type
A total of 133 specimens of the Perdiz type was found at the three
sites, their distribution being: Buzzard Cave, 87; Little Buzzard Cave,
44; and Forrester Cave, two. These points conform to the type description of Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954: 504-505).
At the Smith Rocksheher, Suhm (1957: 35) recognized eight variants of the Perdiz type. Since all the variants were concentrated in a
single zone at the Smith Site, probably they all should be regarded as
a single type. The shelters reported herein produced similar varieties
with the possible inclusion of another (Fig. 3, L, M; Fig. 7, I; Fig. 12,
J) which has been referred to as the "Foyle Flake" point (Miller and
Jelks, 1952: 177-178).
Scallorn Type
Scallorn points from the three sites total 84. There are 32 from
Buzzard Cave, 38 from Little Buzzard Cave, and 14 from Forrester
Cave. The writer found several variations within the Scallorn type.
One variety is a very small side-notched form (Fig. 3, D, E; Fig. 7, R;
Fig. 12, B, E). Another variety is large, crudely made, and basally
notched (Fig. 3, G; Fig. 7, P). Another is a well-made, basally notched
form (Fig. 7, Q). Some are long, thin, and serrated (Fig. 12, A) ; others
have markedly concave blade edges (Fig. 12, G). The rest are intermediate corner-notched varieties. Again, there was no basis for separation of these variations into distinct types, since they all seem to be
gradations and are apparently culturally homologous. The ratios of
corner-notched to basally notched Scallorn points are 25-6, 25-!4, and
12-2 at Buzzard, Little Buzzard, and Forrester Caves respectively.
Cliffton Type
Fourteen Cliffton points were found at Buzzard Cave, eight were
found at Little Buzzard Cave, and two were recovered from Forrester
Cave. Suhm (1957) has suggested that Cliffton may be a variety of the
Perdiz type. This observation was borne out by the writer’s findings

GENTRAL TEXAS /~SPEGT SITES

in Hill County. His classification of certain arrow points as Cliffton
(Fig. 3, A, B, C; Fig. 7, A, B; Fig. 12, H, I) was completely arbitrary.
He simply felt that the examples so classed were either slight deviations from the norm or were unfinished Perdiz points. The classification of Cliffton as Perdiz would not significantly change the percentage ratios of Scallorn to Perdiz except at Forrester Cave, where
the number of Perdiz would be doubled. In certain cases, Young points
resemble the Cliffton type, being distinguishable only on the basis
of chipping technique (Fig. 12, P, Q).
Alba Type
Of 19 Alba points, six came from Buzzard Cave, five from Little
Buzzard Cave, and eight from Forrester Cave. It was observed that the
specimens called Alba here (Fig. 3, O-R, Fig. 7, N, O; Fig. 12, K-M)
may be varieties of the Perdiz type. Suhm (1967: 36) has suggested
the name "Eddy" for similar points. She saw a possibility that Eddy
may be a link between the Scallorn and Perdiz types and the respective loci with which they are identified. Since the writer is unable to
distinguish between the Eddy and Alba types, he has chosen 1o use the
more familiar term "Alba." In at least one case, the Alba type seems
to grade into the Bonham type (Fig. 12, M).

Fresno Type
Fourteen Fresno points were found, nine at Buzzard Cave (Fig. 3,
W-X), and five at Little Buzzard Cave (Fig. 1, C-D). No Fresno points
were found at Forrester Cave.
Young Type
Thirty-two Young points were distributed among the three sites as
follows: Buzzard Cave, 15 (Fig. 3, U-V); Little Buzzard Cave, 12
(Fig. 7, E-F) ; Forrester Cave, 5 (Fig. 12, P-R).
Cuney Type
Two arrow points of the Cuney type were recovered from Buzzard
Cave (Fig. 3, S-T).
Washita Type
The single Washita type arrow point was found at Buzzard Cave
(Fig. 3, AA). It is pitch-stained.
Reed Type
The two Reed points both came from Little Buzzard Cave (Fig. 7,
L-M). Bell (1958: 76) associates the Reed type with both the Gibson
and Fulton Aspects in the Caddoan Area.

Discussion
The percentage ratios of Perdiz to Scallorn were 54-46, 73-27, and
37-63 for Little Buzzard, Buzzard, and Forrester Caves, respectively.
Assuming diagnostic trait values for Scallorn and Perdiz points, it can
be stated that Little Buzzard is of a conglomerate culture, that Forrester represents predominately a Scallorn type culture, and that Buzzard Cave was occupied principally by peoples who favored the Perdiz
type arrow point. There may be significance in the fact that, whereas
Alba points represent a negligible percentage when compared to Scallorn and Perdiz at Buzzard and Little Buzzard Caves, they represent
a third of this total at Forrester Cave. Although the percentages mathematically indicate an association of Alba and Scallorn points at Forrester Cave, the small number of arrow points found there is not
sufficient for statistical reliability.
Miller and Jelks (195£: 209) have pointed out that three Perdiz
points and two Cliffton points were found at the Davis Site, all in
levels which contained Alto Focus material--thus suggesting contemporaneity of the Perdiz and Cliffton types with the Alto Focus.
However, one of the Perdiz points at the Davis Site was found in the
plow zone, two Perdiz and one Cliffton were found directly beneath
the plow zone, and only one Cliffton, "possibly within the range of
Alba Barbed also," was found in tight association with Alto Focus material (Newell and Krieger, 1949: Table 18). Thus the question of
whether the Alto Focus was coeval with--or earlier than--the Perdiz
arrow point is still unanswered.
Washita points in Texas are estimated by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks
(1954: 500) to date between 1100 and 1500 A.D., although they note
that the type may occur earlier outside Texas Thus both types are
considered by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks to be later than the estimated
date for Alto Focus of somewhere between 500 and 1000 A.D. (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 166). The Cuney point is generally considered to date after 1600 A.D. (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 498),
which would eliminate the possibility of its association with Alto Focus
pottery types according to accepted chronological concepts. Since no
stratigraphy was observed at Buzzard Cave, the Cuney and Washita
points found there cannot be related with assurance to the Alto Focus
pottery also found there. But the possibility that all was left by the
same group of people remains. If future research should demonstrate
an association between Alto Focus pottery and the Cuney and Washita
arrow point types, then an earlier date would be indicated for Cuney
and Washita than has previously been proposed.

CENTI~AL TEXAS ASPECT SITES

It is interesting to note that some of the arrow point forms are similar in outline to some of the dart point forms and perhaps could have
been copied directly from them (cf. Fig. 7, Q with Fig. 6, G; Fig. 3, S
with Fig. 6, J).
DART POINTS

Palraillas Type
The most prevalent dart point type was Palmillas, represented by
15 examples from Little Buzzard Cave and two from Buzzard Cave.
Were it not for the fact that two of these specimens (Fig. 7, Y, Z) were
reworked some time after the time of the original manufacture, as
revealed by differences in patination, it would be assumed that they
in all cases were made by Central Texas Aspect people. Most examples
(Fig. 6, A-D) are, however, unpatinated. It is assumed, therefore, that
Palmillas points at these sites represent both specimens picked up off
earlier sites and specimens made on the sites. It is considered to be a
survival from the Edwards Plateau Aspect; such a survival has been
considered before (Suhrn, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 462).
Yarbrough Type
The second most common dart point type was Yarbrough. One was
found at Buzzard Cave (Fig. 4, C) and 11 (six of them with beveled
blades) at Little Buzzard Cave (Fig. 6, K-M). These fall into two
groups, one group made of a foreign material and having patination in
evidence, the other group made of native unpatinated chert river pebbles. The survival of the Yarbrough type into the Central Texas Aspect
has been suggested (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 492). These excavations indicate the validity of the suggestion.
Other Dart Points
In addition to Palmillas and Yarbrough, several other types of dart
points were recovered, a!l of them occurring in very small quantities.
Two Gary points, three Darl, one Williams, one Kent, three Pandora,
one Wells, three Bulverde, two Pedernales, two Carrollton, and one
Ensor were found. For provenience data on these dart points see
Table 1.
It has been suggested that there is a marked similarity between Yarbrough and Darl points (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 492). The
single Darl point found at Little Buzzard Cave (Fig. 6, N) is a poor
example made of native unpatinated material. It bears only slight
resemblance to the Yarbrough type. The two Darl points from Forrester Cave (Fig. 12, N, O) are of a foreign material, are patinated, and

CEtNTIRAL TEXAS A,SP]KCT SITES

resemble some patinated specimens of the Yarbrough type from Little
Buzzard Cave (Fig. 6, L). At the Collins Site, both Darl and Ensor
dart points were found in Central Texas Aspect levels (Suhm, 1955:
30). Thus the evidence suggests that Darl probably represents a carryover trait from the Edwards Plateau Aspect into the Central Texas
Aspect.
With the exception of one Kent point (Fig. 6, F), all other dart
points are patinated. Several of these (notably the Pandora, Fig. 8, K)
were identified as being of a distinct type of chert found in Coryell
County, Texas (Forrester, personal communication). Several dart
points have been reworked, iudging from condition of patination
and/or smoothness on some surfaces (Fig. 6, I, if, 0; Fig. 7, Y, Z; Fig.
8, L). Suhm recognized a complex system of the picking up of earlier
points by Central Texas Aspect people and their manufacturing of
similar points. This has been indicated by many past excavations and
is becoming increasingly evident as work proceeds. In regard to this,
the writer observed that, as a rule, patinated dart points of foreign materials are generally of better workmanship than the rough-surfaced,
unpatinated points. Harris (personal communication)has observed
that dart points associated with later cultures of north-central Texas
generally tend to be smaller within a given type. Jelks (personal communication) says: "Historical records indicate that most Indian tribes
were using spears in addition to the bow and arrow at the time of
contact with Europeans: This includes tribes of Central Texas. If they
were using spears, it is logical to suppose that at least some of them
had stone points, and since arrow points are too small for effective
use on spears, it is reasonable to assume that the spear points were in
the size range of Edwards Plateau Aspect dart points."
In summary, it may be stated that the Central Texas Aspect people
probably obtained dart points by (1) manufacture, (g) by collecting
from "extinct" Edwards Plateau Aspect sites (in some cases beneath
their own), and possibly (3) by trade with late-surviving Edwards
Plateau Aspect tribes. Darl, Palmillas, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, and
Kent dart point types may have been manufactured in Central Texas
Aspect times.
CHIPPED STONE BLADES

Type I Blades
From Little Buzzard and Forrester shelters there were respectively
41 and two examples of crude blades with rounded bases and no secondary chipping (Fig. lg, V, W). These might be classified as either

knives, dart points, or blanks--or even, if it were not for their extreme
crudeness, as Refugio type dart points. They are herein classed as
Type I blades.
Type II Blades
Thirty-six thin blades with square bases and with some secondary
chipping were recovered (Fig. 8, A-D, H), 12 examples having been
found at each of the three sites. These might be classified as Pandora
points were it not for their crudeness and asymmetry. They are assumed to be knives, but are given the classification of Type II blades.
Type III Blades
Twenty-one biracial implements (Fig. 8, E-G; Fig. 12, U) were
designated Type III blades. Six came from Buzzard Cave, 14 from
Little Buzzard Cave, and one from Forrester Cave.
Type IV Blades
Three very thin, well-worked blades with serrated edges are here
labeled Type IV blades (Fig. 8, I-J). Two of them are asymmetrical
and therefore it is assumed that they are knives. R. KingHarris called
the writer’s attention to the fact that these specimens are similar to
others found in central Texas and called "Copena knives:" With some
research, the writer found that these are actually poor examples of a
kind of artifact found at Belton Reservoir by Miller and Jelks (1952:
181, P1. 26) and called by them Copena knives. The first reference to
this type in central Texas was probably that which mentioned the
occurrence of Copena knives in the non-pottery Round Rock Focus of
the Edwards Plateau Aspect in Coryell County (Kelley, 1947a). The
writer questioned this classification on the grounds that the great majority of specimens were widely divergent from those generally accepted as "classics" of the Copena culture of the eastern United States
(Lewis and Kneberg, 1954: 126; Webb and DeJarnette, 1942: 301306). He later found that near-classic examples had been found at the
Davis Site (Newe!l and Krieger, 1949: 173-175) and that a few examples of a certain type found at the Gahagan Mound were nearclassic Copena knives (Webb and Dodd, 1939: P1. 27, Panel 1). Since
that time, he has found many examples of the general type represented
by the range at Gahagan, both in collections and in illustrations in
literature (although there are few references to their being Copena
type blades). It was found that the range includes Copena points,
Kinney points,* points such as were found at Little Buzzard Cave,
* Recently Robert Forrester excavated a Central Texas Aspect burial in the vicinity of the Buzzard Cave group of shelters. The burial contained three of the type
under discussion, one having a deeply-concave base, making it a near-classic Kinney
point.

Pandora points in a few cases, and in one case a blade made into a
corner-tang knife.t Krieger seems to be of the opinion that the Copena
point of the eastern states might just as easily have been "borrowed"
from the Gahagan-Davis culture(s) as the reverse case (Newell and
Krieger, 1949:174). The general consensus seems to be that this type
spread from east to west. Considering the reported association with
Round l%ock Focus and corner-tang knives, the writer can find no
positive evidence concerning the direction of diffusion, although he
does strongly suspect that this type diffused over a wide area.
It has been observed that, in contrast to the classic examples of
Copena points (Webb and DeJarnette, 1942: 301-306; Lewis and
Kneberg, 1954: 126; and the writer’s personal observation of the collection of point types assembled by Robert E. Bell, University of Oklahoma), similar western forms have a wider range of variation, are
thinner, are in many instances serrated, and, in some cases, are nearly
three times as long as classic Copenas.$
On the basis of this evidence the writer draws the following conclusions: (1) Copena-like knives had a pre-pottery appearance both in
the eastern United States and in Texas;§ (2) on the basis of findings
thus far, Texas varieties cannot be definitely assigned to any particular
culture; (3) the term "Copena" should be dropped from the classification of western types in most cases; (4) the western types should
not be classified by names until further investigation and subsequent
division can be made. Bell (personal communication) supported these
conclusions in stating to the writer that he felt that "none of the varieties so-called in Texas are true Copena points."

MISCELLANEOUS CI-tlPPED STONE IMPLEMENTS

In this category are included gravers (Fig. 5, K); crude scrapers,
choppers, and!or cores (Fig. 5, A-D) ; crude celts or adzes (Fig. 5, E,

(Fig. 3, Y, Z). All are of the usual forms found in the region and they
are considered to have only slight diagnostic value. Several of the drills

were worked from arrow or dart points (Fig. 3, L, O; Fig. 7, J, Y, Z).
Other drill forms have unworked bases (Fig. 7, U; Fig. 4, G, H), serrated bases (Fig. 7, V), large squared bases (Fig. 7, W), or small
squared bases (Fig. 7, X).
PECKED~ GROUND AND BATTERED STONE

This classification includes crude sandstone and limestone hammerstones, flint and quartzite hammerstones (Fig. 9, E-H), quartzite river
pebbles (for stone boiling?) (Fig. 9, C, D), subrectangular manos with
flat, parallel faces (Fig. 9, A), and irregular manos with a pit on one
face (Fig. 9, B).
POLISHED STONE

A fragment of a polished, fine-grained limestone gorget with a hole
and side notches (Fig. 5, G) was recovered at a depth of about one
foot in Little Buzzard Cave. The limestone is apparently not of local
origin.
MINERALS

A single crystal of gypsum from Little Buzzard Cave was the only
unusual mineral specimen recovered.
ARTIFACTS OF BONE AND ANTLER

Antler flakers (Fig. 10, F-I), deer ulna awls of flaking tools (Fig. 10,
J-M), long bone perforators (Fig. 10, C), a perforator made from the
dorsal spine of a catfish (Fig. 10, D), and a bone fishhook (Fig. 11)
were recovered. One antler flaker had been sawed in half and broken
(Fig. 10, E); in another case, one was chopped on and then broken
through, indicating that in at least some cases, these implements were
not worn down by use, but rather were sawed or chopped off before
use.
ARTIFACTS OF SHELL

Two perforated shells (Amblema), perhaps used as net sinkers,
were recovered from Little Buzzard Cave. The holes were made by
battering, rather than by drilling (Fig. 10, A, B).
Thousands of snail shells (Bulimulus) were found throughout the
shelter, about 4~o of them perforated. Perforated snail shells strung
into a necklace were found in a shelter in Val Verde County, Texas, by
Pearce and Jackson (1933:119). Despite the similarity of the perfo-

rated snail shells at the Hill County shelters to those from Va! Verde
County, there is no evidence that they were used here for necklaces.
Snails which had died naturally and had accumulated at the interface
of the cultural and rock fall layers were perforated in the same percentages as those found throughout the midden.

Burials
0nly two burials were found, both at Little Buzzard Cave (see
Fig. 1 ).
BURIAL 1
The absolute depth of the skeleton was £4 inches; height above bedrock was 6 inches. No burial pit was in evidence, nor were there any
stones in association. The body was flexed on the right side with skull
facing south. The jaw was open. The right hand and arm were near
the head; the left hand and arm were near the thigh. The left leg and
foot were flexed, but the right leg and foot were missing. A Scallorn
point was behind the left knee, and a Fresno point lay beh{nd the skull.
The cephalic index is 76.0, and the estimated age was 8 or 9 years.
Data on this burial were taken from notes made by the excavator,
I~obert E. Forrester, Jr.
BURIAL 2
The absolute depth of this burial was 27 inches; height above bedrock was 3 inches. No stones were in association, nor was a burial pit
discernible. Only the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones and the
enamel of the teeth were present, along with a few limey deposits.
However, it appeared that the body was lying on the left side, judging
from the position of the fronto-parietal system. One bone awl, apparently a burial offering, was placed on the left side of the head. The
awl was in a good state of preservation. The estimated age of the infant
burial was 3 months or less. There was no evidence that the teeth had
erupted.

Faunal Remains
The following animal remains were identified by William Blackburn Stallcup, Jr., Associate Professor of Biology, Southern Methodist
University, and are assumed to be representative of the diet of the
peoples who inhabited the shelters--with the exception of Gioniobasis,
a fossil, probably from the limestone ceiling, and with the possible exception of Bulirnulus, which could have been deposited naturally.

Conclusions and Conjectures
Knowledge of the Central Texas Aspect, its age and cultural affiliations, has gone through several stages of analysis in the last fifteen
years. Kelley (1947a: 97-109) hypothesized that an Austin Focus of
the Central Texas Aspect, characterized by Scallorn points (with
* Identified by Joseph Pollard Harris, Associate Professor of Biology, Southern
Methodist University.

~ENTIRAL TEXAS ASPECT SITES

247

Perdiz points often present), represented remains of historic and prehistoric Tonkawa Indians of central Texas, and that a Toyah Focus
of the same aspect, characterized by Perdiz points, represented remains of the Jumano Indians who moved periodically from the central to the western part of the state in historic and protohistoric tinles.
Kelley assumed from relations between Central Texas Aspect components and Edwards Plateau Aspect components that the Edwards
Plateau Aspect survived as late as the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries (Kelley, 1947b: 127). Miller and 7elks (1952) later found it
unfeasible to separate the Central Texas Aspect remains in the Belton
I~eservoir area into two distinct complexes. 7elks (1955) subsequently
discovered a separation of expanding stem arrow points (types Scallorn and Alba) and contracting stem types (Perdiz and Cliffton) at
the Blum l~ockshelter in Hill County. The expanding stem forms
were stratigraphically earlier than the contracting stem forms. Later,
Suhm (1957) found a separation of Perdiz-Cliffton (upper levels),
Scallorn (middle levels), and Edwards Plateau Aspect remains (lower
levels) at the Smith l~ockshelter in Travis County.* Suhm reviewed
the previous literature in regard to cultural associations and chronology~ and reached the following conclusion: whereas the Perdiz and
Cliffton arrow point types--because of their relatively late temporal
placement--could have had a direct relationship with the Jumano
and/or Tonkawa Indians, no positive evidence has yet demonstrated
such a connection. Because of a distinct separation of the Scallorn type
from the Perdiz and Cliffton types at the Blum and Smith sites, she
adopts the Toyah Focus-Austin Focus terminology of Kelley, but rejects Kelley’s proposed 7umano-Tonkawa relationship pending further
evidence.
Following Suhm’s interpretations, it is here concluded that Buzzard
Cave is predominantly of the Toyah Focus, that Little Buzzard Cave
contained a more or less equal mixture of Toyah and Austin Focus
elements, and that Forrester Gave is essentially an Austin Focus component. All three sites seem to be contemporaneous, at least in part,
with the Alto Focus of eastern Texas, judging from the presence of
Alto Focus pottery and Alba type arrow points.
* [Since Mr. Long’s manuscript was received, The Texas Archeological Salvage
Project has excavated the Kyle Rockshelter (located less than a mile from the three
shelters here reported) where deep deposits containing Central Texas Aspect material revealed the same arrow point sequence found at the Blum and Smith sites-that is, Scallorn points were consistently found in stratigraphically earlier zones
than were the Perdiz and Cliffton typ:s. Ed.]

If the dart point analysis for Little Buzzard Cave is correct, it must
be a multi-component site which gradually accumulated a mixture of
material left by different cultural groups. The earlier inhabitants were
probably transitional with respect to the Edwards Plateau and Central
Texas Aspects.
Using estimated time spans for the different pottery types as given
by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954), an age span of from 500 to 1200
A.D. is indicated for the Central Texas Aspect occupation at the three
sites. The estimated dates of Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954) for the
various arrow point types suggest a date somewhere between 700 and
1600 A.D.
According to Troike (1955: 113-143) the Central Texas Aspect
shares 20 (52.6%) of its total traits with the Henrietta Focus. Henrietta Focus shares 67% of the traits listed by Troike for use as norms
and found to be present in Little Buzzard Cave. Edwards Plateau Aspect shares 56%. But Central Texas Aspect shares only 51%. While
this serves to illustrate the limitations of Troike’s methods--because
an absolute trait list was used rather than a percentage trait list--it
also helps to point up certain other cultural relationships. The writer
feels that the consistently high percentage of Central Texas Aspect
traits shared with the Edwards Plateau Aspect is further evidence for
historical descent of the former from the latter. The high percentage
of Edwards Plateau Aspect traits shared with the Henrietta Focus

suggests that the Edwards Plateau Aspect is also ancestral to the Henrietta Focus. It is possible, too, that the Henrietta Focus was influenced
directly during its period of development by the Central Texas Aspect.
