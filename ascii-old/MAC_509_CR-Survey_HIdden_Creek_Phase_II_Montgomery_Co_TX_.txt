ABSTRACT
On April 24, May 24, June 4-16, and June 11-12, 2007, Moore Archeological Consulting,
Inc., conducted a cultural resource survey investigation of locations for 12 proposed stormwater
runoff outflows and an approximately 7 acre tract identified as Area 2 along Little Caney Creek
in Montgomery County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding any identified resources. The investigations were
conducted for Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. (Berg Job No. 5879h), under Corps of Engineers
Permit Application Number SWG-2007-341-RN. An intensive pedestrian field survey of the
current project area was conducted, and included both surface and subsurface (shovel test and
backhoe trench) examination. A total of 43 shovel tests (STs 1-43) and seven backhoe trenches
(BHTs 1-7) were excavated. No evidence of archeological or historic remains or features was
identified by either the shovel tests or the backhoe trenches. Consequently, no further
archeological investigations are recommended. In the event that archeological deposits or
features should be encountered during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity
and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

INTRODUCTION
On April 24, May 24, June 4-16,
and June 11-12, 2007, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural
resource survey investigation of locations
for 12 proposed stormwater runoff outflows
and an approximately 7 acre tract identified
as Area 2 along Little Caney Creek in
Montgomery County, Texas. The objectives
of the investigation were to locate and
identify cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0743) were conducted for Berg Oliver
Associates, Inc. (Berg Job No. 5879h),
under Corps of Engineers Permit
Application Number SWG-2007-341-RN.
The project is the second phase of
development in the area; the initial phase of
work involved the survey of three proposed
outfalls and two detention basins, and was
conducted under Corps of Engineers,
Galveston District, permit number SWG-0607-034 in 2006 (Ferguson and Moore 2006).

The project area is depicted on the
Conroe, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1), and consists of
12 small outfall locations (less than Â½ acre
each), and an irregularly shaped 7 acre tract,
all of which are located along the eastern
bank and two large drainages. The project
is in preparation for a large residential
housing development.
An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the current project area was conducted,
and included both surface and subsurface
(shovel
test
and
backhoe
trench)
examination. A total of 43 shovel tests (STs
1-43) and seven backhoe trenches (BHTs 17) were excavated. The field investigations
were conducted by project archeologist
Randy Ferguson and field technicians Sarah
Blake, Eleanor Dahlin, and Darren Schubert.
Roger G. Moore served as the projectâs
principal investigator.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Soils and Geology
Montgomery County is located
within the West Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic province (Hunt 1974). In the
Texas region, the surface topography of the
plain is characterized by relatively flat
topography that dips slightly towards the
Gulf of Mexico. Geologically, the project
area lies atop the Beaumont Formation, a
surface outcrop that extends from just east
of the Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Climate
The modern climate of the
Montgomery County study area is
dominated by the Gulf of Mexico, resulting
in mild winters and hot and humid summers
(McClintock et al. 1972:67).
Summer
temperatures average 94Â°F (34Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 63Â°F (17Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 47 inches
(119 cm).
Hydrology
The project area is located on the
upper reaches of Little Caney Creek.
Considered a minor stream, the creek is a
tributary of the San Jacinto River. No
archeological sites have been previously
identified along Little Caney Creek.
Flora and Fauna
Montgomery County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. San Jacinto
County is situated within the pine-oak
subdivision of the Austroriparian province
(Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the
dominant floral species of the pine-oak
forest subdivision as loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus
stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandica). Hardwood forests are found
on lowlands within the Austroriparian and
are characterized by such trees as sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa
sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra), and
other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as
well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss
(Tillandisia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal
glabra).

The project area is located on sheet
39 of the Soil Survey of Montgomery
County, Texas (McClintock et al. 1972). Of
the soil types present in the project area, the
majority is identified as Segno fine sandy
loam (Se), while two smaller areas contain
Fuquay loamy fine sand (Fs) and Splendora
fine sandy loam (Sp). Segno fine sandy
loam is described as moderately well
drained to well drained (McClintock et al.
1972:25).
Fuquay loamy fine sand is
described as a well drained soil that
develops on marine or stream terraces
(McClintock et al. 1972:16). Splendora fine
sandy loam soils are described as somewhat
poorly drained with slow surface runoff
(McClintock et al. 1972:26).
Fuquay,
Segno, and Splendora soils are all classified
by Abbott (2001) as upland ancient (preHolocene) alluvium, and are considered to
represent an area of low probability for
containing cultural materials.

may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant

faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy

presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the area began
in the early 16th century with the ill-fated
NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528, deposited
Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas coastline,
possibly on Galveston Island. More longterm contacts resulting from permanent
European settlement did not directly impact
aboriginal lifeways in southeast Texas until
the early 18th century (Patterson 1995).
However, European diseases introduced by
explorers and early traders had begun to
affect Native American populations in Texas
by the 16th century (Ewers 1974).
Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, epidemic diseases, the mission
system, and the fur trade seriously reduced,
and in some cases exterminated, the
indigenous populations residing in the
region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
National Register of Historic Places because
of its significance as a pottery
manufacturing site in operation during the
1850s.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in, or within the immediate
vicinity (Â½ km) of, the project area.

In 1975, an archeological survey of
the Sam Houston National Forest revealed
the presence of cultural materials, and three
sites, 41MQ41, 41MQ42, and 41MQ43,
were recorded. Later in the summer of the
same year, a survey for the proposed Scottâs
Ridge Recreational Project led to the
recording and excavation of 41MQ41, which
was determine to be a very significant
prehistoric site of considerable antiquity.
The excavations at 41MQ41 were important
because it was the first example of a
prehistoric site in the Montgomery County
area that represented artifact types with the
ability to be definitely placed in a temporal
sequence. In terms of 41MQ41, artifacts
excavated led to the strong possibility of an
Early and Middle Archaic component,
placing the site in the 7000 to 1000 B.C.
time range for human occupation (Shafer
and Stearns 1975).

The first archeological site recorded
in Montgomery County was in 1956 by Dr.
E. Mott Davis of the University of Texas at
Austin. The site 4MQ1, is a Late Prehistoric
site located on the West Fork of the San
Jacinto River. The same year, archeologists
with the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project (TASP) began surveying and
recording sites in an area to be affected by
the future presence of Conroe Reservoir.
The 1965 TASP surveys in Montgomery
County yielded a total of 32 archeological
sites that were recorded as 41MQ4 through
41MQ36 (Shafer 1966). In 1967, three of
these sites were revisited and tested for
subsurface cultural materials.
The
excavations of 1967 on the three sites
41MQ4, 41MQ5, and 41MQ6, contributed
greatly to information on the types of sites
and associated cultural materials that
Montgomery County has to offer the
archeological record of Texas (Shafer 1966).

The proposed building of a 300 km
long pipeline in 1977 led to a sturdy of the
eastern portion of Montgomery County
where Texas A&M University recorded
41MQ45 and 41MQ46. Special attention
was paid specifically the area around the
crossing of the river, because its location on
the landscape promoted it as a high
probability area for subsurface archeological
deposits (Taylor 1979).
The largest survey and investigation
in Montgomery County was conducted in
1979 by Grenier Engineering Services, Inc.,
of Tampa, Florida, on a tract of land along
Spring Creek comprising 23,000 acres of the
proposed Woodlands Development Project.
Twelve archeological sites, 41MQ63 to
41MQ74, were recorded during the survey
and all were categorized as prehistoric. The

From 1971 to 1974, archeological
site 41MQ38, Kirbee Kiln, was excavated.
Its importance lies in the fact that it was not
only the first historic site to be
systematically documented and excavated in
Montgomery County, but it was also the first
site in the area to be registered in the

6

sites were further subdivided into prehistoric
categories, with six of the sites being
classified as Late Prehistoric. Two sites
displayed aspects of Late Prehistoric and
Archaic, and the remaining four sites were
undetermined prehistoric due to the fact that
no diagnostic artifacts were excavated that
could aid archeologists in placing the sites
into a specific temporal sequence (Grenier
Engineering Sciences, Inc. 1981).

In 1990, a survey of the proposed
wastewater treatment facilities in the town
of Woodloch by the Texas Water
Development Board revealed a potentially
significant archeological site, 41MQ55.
Later that same year, William E. Moore of
Brazos
Valley
Research
Associates
conducted further testing of the site.
Through this investigation, it was
recommended that additional research
should be performed on the site in order to
determine its eligibility for the National
Register of Historic Places (Moore 1990).

The next largest cultural resource
project to be undertaken occurred in 1986
when archeologist from the Texas
Archeological Survey Team surveyed 3570
acres
of
Lake
Creek
Reservoir.
Archeologists utilized an approach that
entailed an intensive detailed synthesis of
data on the geomorphology, ethnohistory,
and archeology of the Lake Creek Reservoir
area. This work was the most detailed
information to date on the archeology of
portions of the Montgomery County area.
During the survey project, a total of 46
prehistoric sites, 41MQ75 to 41MQ120
(four with historic components) were
recorded (Bement et al. 1987).

Moore Archeological Consulting
conducted a survey of the Phase I portions
of the current project in 2006 (Ferguson and
Moore 2006). The project focused on the
locations of three proposed outfalls and two
detention basins, and included both shovel
testing and backhoe trenching.
No
archeological deposits were encountered
during the survey and no further work was
recommended in these areas.

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
screened through Â¼â mesh (Figure 1;
Appendix 1). The location of each test was
recorded and plotted on the project map.
The majority (n=31) were able to reach
precultural subsoil, while the remainder had
to be halted after reaching the water table.
None of the shovel tests produced cultural
materials.

The fieldwork was conducted on
April 24, May 24, June 4-16, and June 1112, 2007, and consisted of a 100%
pedestrian survey that included systematic
shovel testing, backhoe trenching, and visual
examination for surface exposure of cultural
materials (Figures 2, 3).
The project area is depicted on the
Conroe, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 2), and consists of
12 small stormwater runoff outfall locations
(less than Â½ acre each), and an irregularly
shaped 7 acre tract, all of which are located
along the eastern bank and two large
drainages. The project is in preparation for
a large residential housing development.

In order to determine the
depositional nature of the project area, as
well as search for the presence of deeply
buried sites, seven backhoe trenches (BHT)
were excavated during the investigations
(Figures 4-10). Each of these trenches was
placed in proposed outfall sites located
directly on Little Caney Creek. None of the
trenches identified cultural deposits or
features.

A total of 43 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
