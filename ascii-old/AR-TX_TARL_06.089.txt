MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
As a prerequisite for application for a permit to mine lignite
in an area in northern Fayette County, the Lower Colorado
River Authority (LCRA) sponsored an initial intensive. cultural
resource survey of slightly more than 15,000 acres in 1982 and an
additional 10,100 acre survey in 1983. Both surveys were conducted by
the Texas Archeological Survey (TAS), The University of Texas at
Austin. This report contains the results of the second survey season.
The Prospect lies on the upland divide between the Brazos and Colorado
rivers and encompasses portions of two minor drainage
systems
tributary to the Colorado;
Rabbs and Cummins creeks. The entire
25,000 acre Prospect lies within Fayette County;
its northwestern
boundary is the Lee County line. The southern extension of the study
area reported herein included two small towns, Waldeck and Nechanitz.

continued to test the prehistoric settlement pattern model that
postulated a concentration of occupations along the minor drainages.
Although the area was included within the bounds of the Stephen F.
Austin colony and two roads crossed the Prospect as early as the
1830s, the availability of more fertile lands in the major stream
basins delayed settlement here until the 1850s. The historic research
continues in this volume to explore the model developed by Jordan
(1966) that the German speaking immigrants who settled here were
quickly assimilated into the Anglo-American cultural complex, losing
their ethnic distinctiveness more rapidly than the German settlers in
the Texas Hill Country.
This survey was conducted between September 19 and November 23,
1983 under the field supervision of Bruce A. Nightengale. Historic
research was conducted by Jack M. Jackson and Henry Moncure.
The
prehistoric research design was the work of David G. Robinson.
Dr. Solveig A. Turpin gave overall direction to the project as
Principal
Investigator.
Analysis
and report preparation were
accomplished by Bruce A. Nightengale, Jack M. Jackson and Henry
Moncure, assisted by the TAS editorial staff and the Principal
Investigator between December 1983 and March 1984.
Field survey was accomplished by pedestrian transect coverage.
All exposures such as cut banks, gullies, gravel quarries and road
beds were especially noted for indications of subsurface features.
Limited shovel probes were dug at all prehistoric sites in order to
assess both site extent and the depth of the archeological deposit.

All standing structures over 50 years old were recorded as historic
sites, with the exception of a few where owner preference limited
access.
Maps, photographs and sketches were made to record these
structures along with the standard site record form of the Texas
Historical Commission, Artifact collection was limited to those items
helpful in determining site function or age.
All artifacts and
original field documentation are curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.
Seventy seven prehistoric and 29 historic sites were recorded in
the 10,000 acre parcel surveyed during this season. In the total
23,320 acre study area, site inventory reached 133 prehistoric and 63
historic properties. The findings of the first survey were confirmed
by the striking preference for creekside habitation reflected in the
distribution of prehistoric sites.
Based on the survey data from both this and the 1982 season,
three hypotheses were derived which will serve as the basis for
testing and evaluating the prehistoric sites which show some promise
of yielding information useful to archeological research.
The
priority of site selection for testing will, however, be directed by
the final configuration and extent of the mining permit area and an
evalua~ion of the probable impact of these activities on the sites
by
the Texas Historical Commission and the Environmental Protection
Agency.
The three hypotheses are: First, that the differential resource
potential of the two drainage basins resulted in encampments of longer
duration along the pooled or spring-fed waters of the Rabbs Creek
systems.
Conversely, the ample lithic resources of the Cummins Creek
Basin would have attracted smaller groups to this lesser stream for
the procurement of these raw materials as well as subsistence
exploitation.
A second proposition assumes that if the
motivation
for
prehistoric site preference - the distribution of natural resources was constant through time, then settlement pattern would also be
constant.
The acquisition of temporally diagnostic artifacts through
subsurface testing is essential to the evaluation of this second
hypothesis.
The work of previous investigators in this region has often
characterized it as a transitional zone between East, Central and
Coastal Texas cultures. The third hypothesis proposed as a rationale
for site testing is derived from this concept. An attempt will be
made to identify those sites which have potential for contributing
toward the delineation of spheres, or times, of influence of these
cultures and toward identification of specific types of interactions.

iv

A total of 29 historic sites were located and recorded during the
second survey season. The Waldeck Cemetery, although subsumed under
the community recommendation as a National Register district, is an
exceptional amalgam of burial customs.
The Matejowsky House and
adjacent former store site are currently considered eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places. Â· 41FY403, the Wolff House,
clearly holds similar potential but further archival research and
recording is required to document its significance. Three structures,
41FY387, 41FY388 and 41FY396, merit additional inquiry to fully assess
their local importance.
Two other structures contribute to our
knowledge of the early architecture
but
are
not
considered
individually eligible for the National Register because of their
current condition.
All are recommended
for
video-photographic
recording along with significant portions of Waldeck and Nechanitz,
both potentially eligible as National Register of Historic Places
districts.
This economical and powerful method preserves the local
history both orally and visually.
Two major stages in the planning of this large project were
reached after completion of the second intensive survey. The LCRA
defined their 12 year permit area, a 9,408 acre tract on the south end
of the study area, north and west of the communities of Waldeck and
~echanitz.
Only 3,948 acres of the larger permit area will be
modified
by
surface
m1n1ng or the construction of auxiliary
facilities. The recommendations for further work at sites recorded in
both intensive surveys have been reordered to provide a staged testing
and mitigation sequence consonant with the scheduling of mining
activities.
Twenty four of the prehistoric sites will be directly
affected by mining activities. Twenty three historic structures are
included within the 12 year permit area. Seventeen of the prehistoric
sites in or near the initial disturbance zone are currently undergoing
limited testing.
No potentially significant historic sites will be
directly affected in these early stages of mine development.
The
indirect effect of mining on the hamlets and farmsteads adjacent to
the disturbance zone can be anticipated and lessened by a combination
of additional recording, informant interviews and archival research.

ABSTRACT
From September through November 1983, the Texas Archeological
Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, conducted an intensive
cultural resource survey of a 10,000 acre lignite prospect in Fayette
County, Texas for the Lower Colorado River Authority. This project
was a continuation of an earlier survey which covered approximately
13,000 acres in the same area {Nightengale and Jackson 1983).
Seventy-seven prehistoric sites were recorded during the current field
season.
Of these, 29 were recommended for further testing. The
overall creekside distribution of these sites confirmed the settlement
model proposed in the f1rst survey. Twenty nine historic sites were
also recorded. Several hypotheses regarding the acculturation of
German immigrant farmers are examined as well as hypotheses about the
nature of the aboriginal settlement pattern. The results of this and
the previous survey are summarized and placed in the context of mine
permitting and a potential determination of the study area as a
National Register of Historic places district.

INTRODUCTION
In 1982, in compliance with prov1s1ons of the State Surface
Mining Act, prerequisite to application for lignite surface mining,
the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) sponsored an intensive
survey of the cultural resources of the Cummins Creek Prospect, an
area of approximately 15,325 acres in Fayette County, Texas.
Results
of this survey, conducted by the Texas Archeological Survey (TAS), The
University of Texas at Austin were reported in Nightengale and Jackson
(1983).
Fifty six prehistoric and 34 historic sites were recorded in
the 13,288 acres accessible for survey.
Additional studies to
determine eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places
were recommended at twenty prehistoric and seven historic sites.
In 1983, the LCRA expanded the area of the Prospect to include
approximately 10,100 acres adjacent to the original study area (Fig.
1). The intensive survey of this additional tract was carried out
between September 19th and November 23, 1983 by TAS staff members Andy
Cloud, Don Lloyd, Jeff Turpin, Johnny Webel, Steve Kotter and Frank
Broderick under the superv1s1on of Bruce A. Nightengale.
Later
assistance was given by David 0. Brown. Jack M. Jackson conducted the
historic
research.
Solveig A. Turpin
served
as
Principal
Investigator.
This survey was designed
to
comply with
the
National
Environmental Policy Act and its related regulations (40CFR6) as
implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (36CFR, Part 800). This
cultural resource assessment also conforms to criteria and guidelines
set forth by the Texas Historical Commission for Phase II intensive
survey and recommendations offered by
the
Council
of
Texas
Archeologists.
With the additional 10,100 acres, the total Prospect encompasses
over 25,425 acres of Colorado River uplands, including portions of two
minor drainage systems, Rabbs and Cummins creeks.
Access to some
1,232 acres of the area added to the Prospect, not leased by the LCRA,
was denied, reducing the areal coverage to approximately 8,868 acres.
Also included in the 1983 survey was 1,165 acres inaccessible during
the 1982 season. Most of this acreage is along the main stem of
Cummins Creek. In total, 23,321 acre~ were surveyed between 1982 and
1984. Seventy seven prehistoric and 29 historic sites were recorded
during the extended survey of Cummins Creek, bringing the total
inventory in the Prospect to 196 cultural properties; 133 prehistoric
and 63 historic.

INTRODUCTION

This report is considered an extension of the initial survey and
concentrates on presenting the data accumulated during the 1983 field
season.
Introductory material, summarized from Nightengale
and
Jackson (1983), includes an abbreviated environmental background and a
discussion of methods and techniques used to gather the field
information.
The following section, Prehistoric Resources, presents
the archeological background, summarizes the continuing prehistoric
research design, describes the results of the survey and lists the
sites which may meet criteria for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places. The historic resources section format parallels
that of the preceding chapter.
While this report was undergoing
review by the participating regulatory agencies, the LCRA filed an
application for a permit to mine lignite with the Railroad Commission.
chapter, added to this report after the permit
A concluding
application, summarizes the findings of both field seasons within the
context of projected land use. Within that chapter, a distinction is
made between the Study Area= the 25,425 acre Prospect in general,
Permit Area = the actual 9,408 acres included within the 12 year
permit request, and Disturbance Zone= the 3,948 acres which will
include the mine proper and auxiliary facilities. Appended are a
complete reprint of the 1982 research design and a narrative
description of sites which, in our opinion, do not merit individual
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Environmental Background
LOCATION
The LCRA's prospective lignite mining area is just south of
Ledbetter in the northeastern corner of Fayette County (Fig. 1). The
Lee/Fayette county line is northwest of the Prospect and
the
Washington/Fayette line is to the north. The 25,000 acre Prospect is
irregularly shaped, but, in general, Highway 290 is the northern
boundary, the Lee County line the boundary in the northwest, various
property lines in the west, FM 3011 in the southwest, and various
property lines in the southeast, east and northeast.
GEOLOGY
The study area is on the West Gulf Coastal Plain (Fenneman 1935).
This plain is made up of geologic formations of Cretaceous age in the
northwest, and Pleistocene age in the southeast;
both generally
parallel the coast in northeast-southwest bands. Three formations and
two gravel deposits are evident in the study area (Fig. 2) (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1974;
Jackson and Garner 1982). The Late Eocene
Manning Formation contains clay, sandstone and petrified wood and
underlies the Jones, Owl and Blair creeks area (Rabbs Creek Basin).
The Whitsett Formation, formed during the Late Eocene or Early
Oligocene, is sandstone with quantities of petrified wood, and

INTRODUCTION

underlies an area along the southeast side of Jones Creek.
The
Catahoula Formation, a Miocene sandstone formation, lies along the
northwest part of FM 2145 at the confluence of Cedar and Cummins
creeks, and in a small pocket along the north side of Cummins Creek
east of FM 1291.
In the majority of the study area, these three formations are
overlain. by Quaternary fluviatile terrace deposits extending south and
west of Highway 290. These deposits have been identified as Uvalde
gravels (Byrd 1971); lag deposits which rest on formations of varying
age and are believed to be materials redeposited from the Ogallala
Formation of the Llano Estacada (Byrd 1971:5).
Lithic material
associated with the Uvalde gravel varies throughout Central Texas but
is basically composed of pebble- to cobble-sized quartz, quartzite,
chert, jasper, granite and silicified wood. The most abundant lithic
materials in the study area are cobbles of quartzite and chert,
producing a ready supply of raw materials for stone tool manufacture
throughout prehistory. Commercial exploitation of these same gravels
in the twentieth century has destroyed some of the prehistoric record.
HYDROLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY
The study area is in the uplands of the Colorado River Basin.
The southern crest and slopes of the interfluvial divide between the
Brazos River Basin and the Colorado River Basin form the northern
boundary of the Prospect. Cummins Creek runs through the northeast
part of the study area, fed by numerous intermittent tributaries, but
the major portion of the flow enters from named tributaries to the
northwest and west. These form the headwaters of Cummins Creek and
include, from northwest to southeast, West Fork, Pin Oak and Turkey
creeks. Alexander Branch, named for Amos Alexander, whose tombstone
(41FY281) is on the north bank, flows into Pin Oak Creek. On the
northeast are Mile Branch and Violets, Flat and Cedar creeks. Cummins
Creek is an intermittent stream; pooled at the beginning of field
work, it flowed during the later part of the survey, after the fall
rains began.
Rabbs Creek flows west of the Prospect but its deeply cut,
west-flowing tributaries, Owl Creek, which is fed by Jones and Blair
creeks, and Rocky Creek cross the study area. All these drainages are
subject to flash flooding.
At the time of the 1982 survey, Jones
Creek held an adequate supply of pooled water and, according to local
informants, was historically a good spring fed water supply during dry
spells. During the 1983 survey, Owl Creek held pooled water. A local
informant stated that several springs exist along Owl Creek and
further north along Greens Creek. This same informant knew of several
springs in the area that have ceased to flow because of increasing
aridity.

CUMMINS CREEK

In order to retard overbank flooding along Cummins Creek, the
Soil Conservation Service erected six water control structures which
dammed seven drainages: West Fork, at the county line;
Mile Branch
and Violets Creek at their confluence; Turkey Creek, just west of its
juncture with Cummins Creek; Flat Creek;
Shaw Creek proper;
and
Shaw and Albers Branch.

inundated by these retention ponds.

prehistoric occupation of this area and also affected early historic
settlement.
CLIMATE AND VEGETATION
Interdependent aspects of climate and
vegetation
in
the
prehistoric environment have been studied in Central Texas through the
pollen analyses of three peat bogs in Gonzales and Lee counties, and
one archeological site in Travis County (Bryant 1969). Briefly, the
results of these studies indicated a decline in woodland vegetation in
the Late Glacial to the present savannah of oak, hic~ory, and gra~~es.
This decline in woodland communities is a result of the trend from
moist to drier climate.
The highest rainfall in Fayette County occurs in April through
the average maximum is September's 4.53 inches
June and September;
(Dallas Morning News 1980-81). The driest months are January, March,
July and August with the minimum average moisture (1.94 inches)
received in March. The average annual temperature ranges from a
maximum of 96 degrees F in July to a minimum of 42 degrees F in
January.
Present vegetation in Fayette County consists of an overstory of
post oak, blackjack oak and hickory, and an understory of little
bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, purpletop, and long-spike silver
bluestem;
a group Gould (1973:3) terms Post Oak Savannah. Figure 3
illustrates some of the vegetational cover within the study area.
Stands of loblolly pine were noted in the southwest portion of the
study area during the 1983 survey. These grow in pockets made acidic
by the leaching of lignite deposits.
When dissected by creek
downcutting, these deposits also increase the acidity of the pooled
water.
Geographically, this savannah extends from the Texas-Oklahoma
border in the northeast to Bexar and Wilson counties in the southwest,
between the Pineywoods of East Texas, the Gulf Prairie and marshes to
the southeast, and the Blackland Prairie to the northwest.

INTRODUCTION

FAUNA
The mammalian array in Fayette County includes the oppossum,
least shrew, badger, fox, striped skunk, ringtail, raccoon, coyote,
bobcat, fox squirrel, plains pocket gopher, various mice and rats, and
whitetail deer (Davis 1978). During the field work the crew sighted
whitetail deer, pocket gophers, cottontails, water snakes, water
moccasins, common king snakes, turkey vultures, black vultures,
various hawks and one caracara.
Fauna utilized by aboriginal populations at the Cedar Bridge
Site, 41FY74, a Late Prehistoric hunting camp, were bison and mussel.
Evidence from other excavated archeological sites in neighboring
counties indicates consumption of numerous varieties of fish, bird and
mammal, many still found in the region today (lord, in
Hall
1981:422-423).
SOILS
The following brief descriptions of the soil types in the 1983
survey area are as mapped and described by the Soil Conservation
Service (1978-1981).
These soils are similar in that they are
incohesive, sandy and poorly drained. As was the case in the 1982
survey area, only Bleiberville clay, or less than 2 percent of the
total study area, is considered prime farmland. This lack of highly
productive soil accounts, in large part, for the rather late historic
settlement of the area.
Soil Descriptions

In the first intensive survey, sites were found to correlate with
Mabank, Shalba and Bunyan soils, indicative of a preference for
creekside habitation and the higher visibility afforded by an eroded
landscape (Nightengale and Jackson 1983:25). Mabank and Shalba soils
are not found in the extended survey area. The relationship between
site distribution and soil types is further discussed in the
Prehistoric Resources, Results of the Survey section of this report.
Methods and Techniques
Prior to the inception of field work, Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) site files and appropriate USGS topographic
maps for Fayette County were examined for: 1) physiographic location
and kinds of sites in the county, and 2) the locations of any
prehistoric or historic sites recorded in the study area. Information
from these records was compiled for a site settlement model for the
county (see Appendix I), but no sites had been recorded within the
project boundaries.
The Texas Historical Commission's National
Register of Historic Places files were also examined to determine if

In conjunction with site recording, local and individual family

and local residents.
Maps of the study area, supplied by the sponsor and TAS, included
a 1":1000 1 landowner tract map, 1":1000 1 aerials, and USGS 7.5"

Survey
technique varied with the terrain. The most generally used procedure
was to take bearings on fencelines, align the crew perpendicular to
the fenceline at 30 meter intervals, and then walk the length and
width of the property. Each surveyor walked a zig-zag pattern to
increase the area scanned. Along drainages, surveyors paralleled the
creek on each side in order to observe cut banks and terraces. Ground
visibility was limited in some areas by dense cedar brakes and
greenbriar, and by ground cover of leaf litter and grasses in improved
pasture. Natural erosion, gullying, sheetwash and bank slump had both
exposed and destroyed numerous sites (Fig. 4).
At prehistoric sites, shovel probes were dug to ascertain the
extent and depth of subsurface cultural deposits and to assess the
nature of the soils. The contents of each probe were screened through
1/4 inch hardware cloth, recorded by level, and probe locations
plotted on the site map with bearing and distance measured to a
relocatable datum. Structural drawings were made at historic sites in
lieu of shovel probes.
Artifact collection was kept to a m1n1mum. Only functionally and
temporally diagnostic specimens were collected.
The density and
distribution of non-diagnostic material was noted on the forms.
Descriptions of the collected artifacts are based on comparisons with
established types as discussed in Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1982), Suhm
and Jelks (1962) and Weir (1976a); with similar types reported from
sites within the region (Fullem 1977;
Hall 1981;
Honea 1961;
Skelton 1977;
and conversations with TAS and area archeologists).
Standard metric measurements were taken on each projectile point.
These include:

following the description of the site from which they came in the
Sites Recommended for Testing section and Appendix II. All specimens,
photographs and other documentation are curated at
the
Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.
All sites were plotted on three maps (topographic, aerial and
tract) and recorded on State of Texas archeological site data forms.
Sites were assigned permanent site numbers in the trinomial numbering
system, i.e., 41 =Texas, FY= Fayette County, 1 =number of site
found within the county.
Thus, for example, 41FY232 is the two
hundred thirty second site recorded in Fayette County, Texas.
HISTORIC METHODOLOGY
Research into the specific history of the survey area was
accomplished using a combination of cadastral maps, tax archives, land
title abstracts and deed records in the Fayette County court house. A
complete ownership history of every site was not constructed. Where
early settlement was established through land and tax records, the
personal histories were fleshed out with data from the manuscript U.S.
Census for 1860 and 1870. The farms that were in operation in the
study area were all located in the Agricultural Schedules of the 1860
census to establish certain data sets required by the research design.
In addition to these primary sources, a number of secondary works
relating to the history of the German element in Texas and to the
history of Fayette County were consulted for information pertaining
directly to the survey area. These works are cited in the text and
listed in the bibliography. As always, Webb's Handbook of Texas was
used extensively as a general reference and research tool.~Additional
biographical
details
were obtained through correspondence with
descendents of the original settlers.
Oral history notes were taken by the crew chief as
the
opportunity
presented itself.
However, systematic oral history
collection is considered an integral part of the testing program later
recommended for some historic sites.

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES
Archeological Background
Fayette County lies between three
archeologically defined
cultural areas - East, Coastal, and Central Texas. Past researchers
have generally considered the area to be a transitional zone most
closely aligned with Central Texas. Skelton (1977:13-16) summarizes
the archeological background and presents the evidence supporting the
tricultural hypothesis in his reporting of investigations prior to the
construction of the Fayette Power Plant, the first major project in
Fayette County sponsored by the LCRA.
Since Skelton's (1977) report, a number of surveys have been
conducted in Fayette County.
Some, a direct result of the Fayette
Power Plant, were transmission line surveys conducted by TAS for the
LCRA (Brown and Kenmotsu 1980; Kenmotsu and Freeman 1980; Robinson
1982). The first, Kenmotsu and Freeman (1980), a transmission line
survey through Bastrop, Caldwell and Fayette counties, located 37
prehistoric sites and 21 historic localities.
Twenty four of the
prehistoric and 17 of the historic sites were in Fayette County and
the majority lie south of the Colorado River.
Brown and Kenmotsu
(1980) reported test excavations conducted at three prehistoric sites
and one historic site. Two of the prehistoric and the one historic
site are located in Fayette County. Robinson's (1982) survey of the
proposed Fayette to Salem transmission line identified only two sites
but resulted in the compilation of prehistoric settlement pattern data
used in the research design for Cummins Creek.
Another transmission
line survey (Laurens, Guy, and Prewitt 1979) for the Fayette Electric
Cooperative recorded 20 new sites and re-evaluated seven previously
recorded sites.
The first survey of the Cummins Creek Prospect,
carried out in 1982, remains the largest areal study yet carried out
in this region (Nightengale and Jackson 1983). Much of the research
initiated in that project is continued in this, the second Cummins
Creek
survey.
A sample survey of the proposed Columbus Bend
Reservoir, soon to be reported by New World Research, will greatly
expand the representation of mainstem Colorado River sites in the
settlement model derived for Cummins Creek.
Most recently, Goode
(1984a,b)
tested
three Fayette County sites and presented an
alternative to the transitional zone interpretation of the region.
Other authors have speculated upon the transitional nature of the
region surrounding the present study area. Hall (1981) found good
examples of differing cultural influences at Allens Creek in Austin
County.
Intensive excavations took place at three prehistoric sites
and testing at twelve. All were located on a bluff overlooking the
Brazos floodplain.
Two of the sites, 41AU36 and 41AU37, were
stratified deposits containing burials and occupational
debris.

14

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

Components of 41AU36 date to the Middle Archaic, Transitional Archaic,
and Late Prehistoric; 41AU37 had Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, and
Late Prehistoric components.
The third intensively excavated site,
41AU38, is predominantly Late Prehistoric. Through analyses of burial
associated goods, quantities of burials and occupational debris, Hall
has suggested that an eastern influenced, import-export
sphere
prevailed during the Late Archaic and declined during the Transitional
Archaic and Late Prehistoric, or from about 400 to 800 A.O.
(Hall
1981:308).
A variable associated with this interaction was a marked
increase in population size during the Late Archaic followed by
decline in the Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.
Artifact assemblages suggest influences from Central, Coastal, and
East Texas, and from further east, during the Middle Archaic through
the Late Prehistoric.
Fullem (1977) examined and compared dart point types found at the
Black Hopper Site (41FY25) with points found at various places in
Texas. Archaic dart points from 41FY25, when compared with such
classic types as Bulverde, Wells, and Godley, were found to possess
distinct morphological attributes. Fullem suggests that the variation
in
.. Archaic projectile points from the Black Hopper
site illustrates the mixture of artifacts and
traits that would be expected from an exchange
among the three coterminous cultural areas
central, east and coastal. (Fullem 1977:29).
The mechanisms which result in the observed point varieties are a
focus of the recommendations for further testing of sites in the
Cummins Creek Prospect.
Skelton (1977:118) suggests that because of the abundance of
chert cobbles in the upland area along Cedar Creek, groups from
different geographic areas may have exploited these resources. Eighty
percent of the present study area is overlain by Quaternary fluviatile
terrace deposits of gravels containing large quantities of chert and
quartzite;
two percent more is overlain by the Manning Formation
which contains quantities of workable petrified wood. These deposits,
readily available along the banks of Cummins Creek, could have made
this a very desirable lithic procurement area. Located on the divide
between the Brazos and Colorado River basins, the Prospect would have
been easily accessible to groups from both basins, as well as from the
northwest and southeast.
Although Skelton (1977:123) does not rule
out local adaptation by an indigenous cultural group, he largely
supports the idea of groups influenced by diffusion of stylistic ideas
from peripheral cultural groups.
Peterson (1965:54) questioned if the pottery found at 41BU1
(Erwin Bridge Site) was made locally or traded in from the coast.
Prewitt (1982:218) makes a good case for either direct contact with

CUMMINS CREEK

15

the coast or extensive trade during the San Marcos Phase (2600-2250
BP) at Loeve-Fox Site (41WM230). His argument is based on a conch
columela bead associated with a cremated burial and a marginella bead
found in association with a hearth.
Prewitt uses the technology
involved in the manufacture of the conch bead as an argument in favor
of an extensive trade network with the coast.
This interpretation
suggests that the transitional zone was traversed by movement of goods
to and from the coast, movement of people to and from the coast, or
the use of the transitional zone as a tri-cultural interactive sphere.
In a report published after the conclusion of the 1983 field
survey at Cummins Creek, Goode (1984b) suggested that at various times
in prehistory, indigenous populations developed local traditions,
similar but
not
identical to those of neighboring cultures.
Contradictory as these diverse interpretations may seem, they are not
necessarily mutually exclusive.
Only the more intensive study of
excavated sites can determine the validity of these hypotheses over
the long time span of prehistoric occupation of the region.
Although the study area may, in many respects, differ from
Central Texas, that chronology is the most fully developed and will be
used as the temporal framework for artifacts and sites located during
this survey.
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (prior to 10,000 to 8,000 BP)
The evidence for this, the earliest known cultural period in
Texas prehistory, is based in Central Texas on surface finds and
excavated material. Buried cultural deposits associated with this
period have been unearthed at the Levi Rockshelter on the Pedernales
Prewitt 1982),
River (Alexander 1963), the Loeve Site (Eddy 1973;
Tombstone Bluff on the San Gabriel River (Prewitt 1974a, 1982), 41BX52
on the outskirts of San Antonio (Henderson 1980) and 41WM235 near
Leander (Young 1984). Projectile point types known to be assignable
to the Paleoindian occupation of the region are Clovis, Folsom and
Plainview.
Direct stratigraphic associations for the traditionally accepted
subsistence of Paleoindian groups, that of dependence on now-extinct
Pleistocene megafauna, is lacking in Central Texas.
It is assumed
that here their economy depended upon hunting and gathering, a mode of
existence which was retained until the time of contact with the first
Europeans.
ARCHAIC PERIOD (8,500 to 1,250 BP)
The Archaic hunters and gatherers of Central Texas were highly
dependent on variable environmental factors - the availability of
water, game and edible vegetation. Tool kits included contracting and
expanding stem dart points, food processing tools such as manos and
metates, and various auxiliary implements. Based on the changes that

16

PREHISTOF.IC RESOURCES

took place within the tool kit and other cultural markers, such as the
increase and decrease of burned rock middens, a cultural construct
containing eleven chronological phases for the Central Texas area has
been proposed by Prewitt (1981). This chronology combines and expands
on earlier syntheses (Prewitt 1974a, 1974b, 1982; Weir 1976a, 1976b)
and earlier studies (Jelks 1951; Johnson 1967; Kelley 1947a, 1947b;
Suhm, Kreiger, and Jelks 1954) and adds new phases to accommodate
various changes.
These eleven phases correspond to
previous
chronologies as follows:

Prewitt considers this chronology a basis for future refinement and is
currently revising it to accommodate new information.
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (1250 to 200 BP)
This period, referred to by Prewitt (1981) as the Neo-archaic
stage in Central Texas, is one of gradual change, exemplified by the
replacement of the atlatl and dart by the bow and arrow. Pottery made
its appearance during the later part of this period and, in parts of
Texas, although not readily documented in Central Texas, incipient
agriculture emerged.
Certain time diagnostics are used to delineate
subdivisions within the period, the Granbury and Scallorn arrow points
characterize the Austin Focus (1250-650 BP) and the Perdiz and
Cliffton arrow points, along with the bone-tempered Leon Plain
pottery, characterize the Toyah Focus (650 - 200 BP). These are the
foci of the Central Texas Aspect (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954) and
phases of the Neoarchaic (Prewitt 1981). Prewitt (1981:68,74) has
proposed that the appearance of cemeteries during the Neoarchaic is a
chronological delineator for this period in Central Texas.
HISTORIC PERIOD
The beginning of this period is marked in Texas by the first
European contact - the journey of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca across
Texas ca. 1528. This was followed by French and Spanish traders and
explorers when the study area was part of a larger region occupied by
autonomous bands of hunters and gatherers known as the Tonkawa

CUMMINS CREEK

17

(Newcomb 1961).
These bands coalesced in the nineteenth century to
form the Tonkawa Tribe. Honea (1961:11) found that local tradition
marked Yegua Creek (18 km north of the study area) as the boundary
between the Waco Tribe to the north and the Tonkawa to the south.
Later encroachments by incoming Comanches and the advancing waves of
settlers decimated the Tonkawa.
Prehistoric Research Design
A site settlement model for Fayette County was compiled by David
G. Robinson (Nightengale and Jackson 1983:14-20) as a research design
for the 1982 survey of the Cummins Creek Prospect. The original model
is reprinted in this report as Appendix II for the convenience of
readers who do not have access to the 1983 report.
This summary of
prehistoric
settlement correlated
seven site types with five
physiographic zones. A preference was noted for creekside campsites
with light scatters of chert flakes, burned rock and no discernible
features. Based on current theory, this type of site was used as a
resource procurement camp where various needs, such as food gathering
and lithic procurement, were satisfied.
Used
and
reused
at
intermittent times of the year, this camp was occupied by groups who
purportedly returned to more permanent base camps along the major
stream courses.
The 56 prehistoric sites found during the first survey were used
to
test
Robinson's
county-wide
compilation.
This comparison
demonstrates the viability of the upland creek settlement model;
the
majority of sites in both the Rabbs Creek Basin (28 sites) and the
Cummins Creek Basin (28 sites) were light scatters without features
along creek terraces and lower slopes (Nightengale and Jackson
1983:20; Appendix !:Table I-2).
During the analysis of site characteristics, several major
differences were noted between sites in the two basins. The sites
found in the Cummins Creek Basin were
exemplified by
heavy
concentrations of chert flakes and burned rocks amid gravel deposits
containing chert and quartzite.
Also, these sites were
found
primarily along Cummins Creek proper with few sites in the drier
upland areas of the basin.
In comparison, the Rabbs Creek Basin
contained a higher density of sites in the area surveyed along Jones
and Owl creeks and an increase in datable diagnostic material from
these sites.
The existence of several springs makes the Rabbs Basin
drainages more reliable sources of water.
Cummins Creek flows
intermittently with pooling during the dry periods of the year. The
numerous flood retention structures built by the Soil Conservation
Service testify to the extremes in flow level experienced in the
Cummins system. These differences were the basis for two of three
hypotheses to be tested at the 20 sites selected from the 1982 sample.

18

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

I. Cummins Creek sites were primarily seasonal camps used when
the stream was flowing and were oriented toward acquisition of raw
materials for lithic tool production.
Conversely, the sites along
Jones Creek were more permanent or of longer duration due to the more
reliable presence of pooled or spring water.
II. The preference for establishing more permanent settlements
along Jones Creek and the sporadic occupation of the Cummins Creek
area was a constant throughout prehistory.
III. Cummins Creek Prospect lies within a zone of transition

artifacts diagnostic of these three cultural areas will be found at
the tested sites.
The investigation of the additional 10,100 acres extended the
previous model of prehistoric settlement in the two upland basins,
most notably into the Rabbs Creek Basin, where spring water is
available.
In the Rabbs Basin, buried cultural material of early
prehistoric age was unearthed at some sites and observed on the
surface at others.
This, combined with the site density along the
Owl, Jones and Blair creek drainways, poses some interesting questions
about early upland settlement in the Colorado Basin. The effect of
past environmental changes on settlement can be addressed as an
integral part of the research into the cultural blend of the area.
What were the environmental factors molding Paleoindian/Early Archaic
settlement, and did these factors affect upland spring settlement
during these and subsequent time periods?
Some researchers have
postulated interesting and correlative answers to these issues.
McKinney (1981:91-120) suggests
that
some
Early Archaic
settlement was a response to environmental change. Two epochs of
extreme dryness during the Altithermal climatic period may have
concentrated Early Archaic occupations along the Balcones Escarpment
(McKinney 1981:114). Gunn and Weir (1976) propose that climatic
fluctuations during the Central Texas Archaic are reflected by
variations in lithic assemblages. Their analysis suggests that four
of the seven assemblages used during the Central Texas Archaic were a
cultural response to environmental changes (Gunn and Weir 1976:35).
These changes may have also affected settlement in the upland basin
area of the Colorado River.
Drawn to reliable water sources,
prehistoric groups would have depended extensively upon springs
because other water resource areas were dry.
Spring settlement was found to span prehistory at Spring Lake in
San
Marcos
where Shiner
(1983:1)
found
evidence
of Late
Paleoindian/Early Archaic as well as later occupations.
He also
investigated several other spring sites on the Edwards Plateau and
along the Balcones Fault. Each of these was situated beside a spring
coming from a Hill Country aquifer. Shiner (1983:6) suggests one
explanation for large spring encampments:

CUMMINS CREEK

19

Since the waters emerge at temperatures ranging from 70-75
degrees Fahrenheit, the effects on local flora and fauna
would be highly significant. Not only would edible flora
and small fauna be available year round, green foliage near
the temperate water would attract large fauna during dry or
cold seasons.
The permanence of spring encampments would have been dependent upon a
relatively steady, large flow. No reconstruction of the history of
spring activity in Fayette County has been attempted, but the temporal
range of prehistoric settlement suggests at least recurrent flow of
sufficient quantity to support populations over a long period of time.
Brune (1975:22) states that, in general, prehistoric spring flow
remained relatively constant, although water volume varied during wet
and dry climatic cycles.
Alteration in spring flow came with the
settlers who deforested the land and drilled wells, reducing the
underground source water. The effect of spring water on prehistoric
settlement is subsumed under hypotheses I and II and will be a problem
addressed in the testing program at Cummins Creek.
Results of the Survey - Prehistoric Resources
The Cummins Creek II Lignite Prospect encompasses 10,100 acres of
land.
Approximately 8,828 acres were intensively surveyed for
cultural resources. Access to the remaining 1,232 acres was denied
for various reasons. Only 420 of the unsurveyed acres fall within the
recently defined permit area and none of those are within the proposed
disturbance zone.
When access to these rema1n1ng properties is
granted, any that might be affected by mining activities will be
surveyed.
It is highly probable that site distribution in the
unsurveyed areas will be similar to that of the Prospect as a whole;
site settlement is most likely to occur along the creek terraces and
lower slopes. Also surveyed in this season were 1,165 acres of land
inaccessible during the 1982 survey season. The majority of this
acreage was located along Cummins Creek. In total, 23,321 acres were
surveyed over the course of both field seasons.
As a result of the survey, 106 sites were recorded in the
extended study area. Seventy seven are prehistoric, one described in
the prehistoric section has a historic component and 29 are solely
historic sites.
The latter are discussed in the historic section of
this report. The salient characteristics of all the prehistoric sites
are presented in tabular form (Table 1) and some typical settings are
illustrated in Figure 3.
A narrative description of sites not
considered eligible for the National Register of Historic Places is
appended. Natural and artificial disturbances to site integrity are
shown in Figure 4.

PREHISTORIC RESOTJRCES

Comparison of the 77 prehistoric sites with the county wide
settlement model presented by Robinson (Appendix I; Nightengale and
Jackson 1983:14-20) demonstrates its usefulness. In short, Robinson's
model indicated that settlement in these upland basins would be
creekside campsites marked by
light
lithic
scatters without
discernible features.
The majority of sites in the study area are
featureless light scatters of stone flaking debris, stone tools and
burned rock along creek terraces and lower slopes of basin drainages
(Tables 2,3). Also noted in this year's results was an increase in
sites described as light scatters with features. The majority of
these are located in the Rabbs Basin where limited shovel probes
revealed a number of buried hearths. It is probable that limited
testing will result in a reclassification of sites now recorded as
featureless scatters.

The chi-square statistic generated by cross tabulation of site
type and physiographic zone is not statistically significant, largely
because of the similarity between the frequencies of light scatters
without features on creek terraces and lower slopes. However, when
those two physiographic zones are combined and the Cummins Creek site
data is added to the original model of Fayette County settlement
(Appendix I), the distribution demonstrates its deviation
from
randomness at a significance level of .01.
As was the case in the previous survey, the variable of site area
is of some value in discriminating between light scatters with and
without features. Those with features (X=5930m) average over 50
percent larger than those without (X=3987m). Lithic scatters averaged
1,728 meters, or less than half the mean of light scatters without
features.

The most salient characteristic of overall site distribution
remains the striking preference for creekside occupation, noted in the
initial survey (Nightengale and Jackson 1983:21) and reaffirmed this
season.
The statistical test of this distribution against the most
stable surviving element of past environment; soil types, can now be
repeated using a much larger sample (Table 4). The basic premise,
stated in terms of the null hypothesis, is that if a given soil type
occupies a certain percentage of the Prospect it can be expected to
contain the same percentage of the total number of sites recorded.
The chi-square test follows Hodder and Orton (1976:224-225) by means
of a computer program written by Turpin (1978).

The difference between the observed and expected site frequencies in
the first season's survey was greatest on Bunyan, Mabank and Shalba
soils. The high chi-square generated for Mabank and Shalba soils may
be in part attributable to their extremely limited occurrence. Other
factors include the creekside location of the Mabank acreage and the
extreme
gullying of the Shalba soils which provide subsurface
exposure. Of more significance is the high site density on the Bunyan
soils, creekside alluvially derived sediments which are frequently
flooded. The discrepancy between the observed and expected on Arol
and Burlewash soils points toward another factor, only summarily
discussed previously. The bulk of the Aral soils are in the Cummins
Creek Basin which, in general, exhibits a much lower site density than
the Rabbs Creek Basin where Burlewash soils are concentrated.

CUMMINS CREEK

27

Overall, the 133 prehistoric sites recorded in both seasons are
unevenly distributed with 82 in the Rabbs Basin and 51 in the Cummins
Creek Basin. Of the 77 sites recorded in 1983, 54 are in the Rabbs
Creek Basin.
Used here, Rabbs Basin refers to Owl Creek and its
tributaries, Jones and Blair creeks. Rabbs Creek proper flows outside
the Prospect but the high concentration of sites in the Basin is a
function of Rabbs 1 spring fed tributaries. Although this cannot be
regarded as the only factor affecting prehistoric settlement, it
played an important part in the decision to use a certain locale.
Other factors, such as availability of food and lithic resources,
influenced this decision making process.
Ample food
resources
generally correlate with abundant and constant water, since water
would support vegetation and, in turn, game.
Lithic resources are
readily available in the Cummins Creek Basin and, to a lesser degree,
in the Rabbs Basin.
Based on observed and collected diagnostic
cultural material, this combination of factors promoted prehistoric
occupation throughout the Prospect from the Late Paleoindian through
the Late Prehistoric Period, or from approximately 8000 to 200 BP
(Figs. 5-8). The Rabbs Basin, however, produced eight sites with Late
Paleoindian or Early Archaic style projectile points.
By comparison, 21 of the 23 sites in the Cummins Creek Basin were
found along Cummins Creek proper. This type of settlement was also
noted in the first Cummins Creek project. However, in contrast to the
1982 survey results, where the majority of sites were featureless
concentrations of lithic debitage and burned rock without temporal
significance, the sites recorded during the present survey yielded
time diagnostic projectile points from amid the concentrations of
burned rock and lithic debris. Most of the sites, with the exception
of one late Paleoindian/Early Archaic locale, are of Middle Archaic,
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric age. Despite these indications,
settlement in this basin was not necessarily later than that of the
Rabbs Basin.
Only subsurface testing can demonstrate the age of
buried deposits. It can be hypothesized, however, that use of this
basin may have become more intense during and after these dates.
These questions form the basis for further research into the area.
This research in turn is based on a design which explores the
prehistoric settlement, using the
basins
to
define
separate
physiographic zones and compare local to regional settlement.
Prehistoric Sites Recommended for Testing
The intensive survey of the enlarged study area resulted in only
minor modification of 1983 hypotheses and test questions. As before,
the 29 sites (Table 5) selected for testing represent the two basins,
permitting comparisons between the two physiographic zones unique to
the study area and, more broadly, to regional diversity.
Testing at
selected sites is also based on the possibility that intact subsurface
deposits will satisfy criteria for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places. Subsequent results of testing at these sites will

marked by pooling of spring water, thus providing a more reliable
water source. The differences in resource availability between the
two drainages and the intervening interfluvial divide provide the
basis for Hypothesis I:
I.

Cummins Creek sites were primarily seasonal camps used when
the
stream was flowing and were oriented toward the
acquisition of raw materials for lithic tool production.
Conversely, the sites along Owl Creek and its tributaries
were more permanent or of longer duration due to the more
reliable presence of pooled or spring water.

Sites recommended for testing this

hypothesis will
assume
following questions are

a) Owl, Jones and Blair creek sites will show a greater
diversity in tool types suggesting the more varied functions
characteristic of longer term encampments;
b) the lithic material recovered from sites along Cummins
Creek should reflect a predominance of debris from initial
reduction; Owl, Jones and Blair creek sites' debitage would
result from the final production of tools;
c) features, such as large hearths, burials or burned rock
accumulations, should be more frequent at sites along Owl
Creek and its tributaries;
d) perishable items, such as food residues, which might
indicate the season of occupation or primary subsistence
base, are not to be expected in the uncohesive sandy
environment characteristic of the Cummins Creek Prospect.
However, the results of shovel probes at a number of sites
indicate the possibility of intact hearths with charcoal at
depths of 80 centimeters or more. The recovery of lump wood
charcoal holds some promise for the recovery of identifiable
plant or animal remains representative of
prehistoric
dietary items and may allow a determination of the season of
occupation.

CUMMINS CREEK

Time diagnostic artifacts were common at the sites along Owl,
Jones and Blair creeks, supportive of Hypothesis I; a statement that
more diverse and formal tools would be recovered in that area than at
the Cummins drainage locations. The occupational periods represented
were Early, Middle and Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric.
Similarly,
more features were detected in the Rabbs Creek sites.
The settlement pattern reflected by
the
distribution
of
prehistoric sites across the landscape of the Prospect is dramatic in
the preference for stream associated occupation. In the absence of
stricter time controls, any changes in the pattern which might reflect
diachronically variable cultural or physical responses in
site
location are undetectable.
Sites selected for testing hold promise
for intact stratigraphy or buried components which might be datable by
relative or absolute means. Stated in terms of the null hypothesis,
Hypothesis II reads:
II.

The preference for establishing more permanent settlements
along Owl Creek and its tributaries and the sporadic
occupation of the Cummins Creek area was a constant
throughout prehistory.

Given the scarcity of intact, buried cultural deposits in the
naturally uncohesive soils of this upland prospect, sites selected for
testing will stand in support of Hypothesis II if earlier components
consistently underlie the more recent occupation. Conversely, the
isolation of one component sites uncontaminated by earlier or later
occupational debris will refute this proposition.
The majority of the previously reported work in the general
Prospect area has described this region as a contact zone between
Most recently, Goode
East, Central and Coastal Texas cultures.
(1984b) has suggested the converse, that indigenous populations may
have developed their stylistic approach to stone tool manufacture at
various times in prehistory.
As these two propositions are not
of
strict
mutually exclusive and depend upon the acquisition
chronological controls, our previously presented hypothesis remains:
III.

Cummins Creek Prospect lies within a zone of transition
between East, Central and Coastal Texas cultures. A mixture
of artifacts diagnostic of these three cultural areas will
be found at the tested sites. If sites selected for testing
are relevant to the resolution of this proposition, they
will assume National Register significance based on regional
criteria.

Most pertinent to this question is the recovery of artifacts
characteristic of the three different cultural areas.
A second
question, contingent upon the acquisition of such an assemblage, would
be to discern between contemporaneous deposition, implying trade goods
or transitional cultures, and individual occupation, suggesting the

32

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

contraction or expansion of spheres of influence. If no support for
the hypothesis is produced in the testing phase, it should be restated
to include Geode's corollary proposition.
The recommended testing program is intended to determine if any
sites hold cultural deposits relevant to the three stated hypotheses.
If these deposits can be shown to lie in an intact context, the site
may be of National Register quality. The Texas Historical Commission
and the Environmental Protection Agency are considering requesting a
determination of eligibility for large segments of the Prospect as a
National Register Historic District. If such an action is taken, it
can be assumed that many prehistoric sites would be considered as
contributing members. However, recommendations for data recovery or
preservation of the listed sites (Table 5) can only be formulated
based on the results of subsurface testing.
Prehistoric sites not
specifically recommended for testing show little promise for meeting
National Register criteria and are described in Appendix II.
CUMMINS CREEK SITES
Seven sites situated along Cummins Creek have been recommended
for further testing. Five of these contain temporal diagnostics from
the Middle and Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric;
one (41FY314)
contained a Late Paleoindian cache.
These sites are relevant to
hypotheses I and II.
41FY310
Site 41FY310 is in the Cummins Creek Basin on a natural northwest
southeast trending levee paralleling Cummins Creek. The area has been
cleared sometime during the last 25 years;
piles of earth were
observed at various points along the levee. 41FY310 lies 500 meters
southwest of a southeast meander of Cummins Creek.
Soils are the
frequently
flooded Bunyan series fine sandy loams (SCS 1980).
Vegetation in the area consists primarily of field grasses, scrub, and
yaupon with scattered post oak and cedar trees. Based on diagnostic
cultural material, this probable open campsite appears to have been
occupied during the Round Rock phase of the Middle Archaic Period
(3400 - 2600 BP), though it may contain additional components.
Artifacts observed on the site surface include burned rock and flakes.
Shovel probes turned up more burned rock, a core, several large and
small flakes, two charcoal chunks and a complete Pedernales dart
point.
Subsurface deposits reached a depth of
at
least
40
centimeters.
Using the distribution of surface and subsurface
material as a basis, site size was estimated at 60 meters from
northwest to southeast by 25 meters from northeast to southwest.
Although the site has been affected by some downslope erosion toward
the creek and has been cleared, it appears to be largely undisturbed,
especially beneath the surface.

41FY314
Site 41FY314 is atop an oblong rise in the floodplain of Cummins
Creek, approximately 50 meters northeast of Cummins Creek and 250
meters southeast of the Violets Creek/Cummins Creek confluence. Soils
in the area are Tremona gravelly loamy fine sands (SCS 1979).
Vegetation is primarily short grasses (improved
pasture)
with
scattered oak. Recent rains have exposed cultural material along the
margins of a gully which parallels a recently constructed oil well
access road. Erosion has also exposed underlying sandstone and clay.
Lying about 30 to 40 centimeters below the surface, material in this
cutbank consisted of an artifact cache (Fig. 5) containing 11 primary
flakes, a complete Angostura lanceolate point and a thick biface.
On
the same level and three meters to the northwest was a thinned biface;
approximately five meters northwest of this a Pedernales dart point
was found in association with a concentration of burned rock. The
projectile points indicate a Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic and a
Middle Archaic occupation (8500 and 2600 BP). Site depth appeared to
be less than 40 centimeters.
Size, based on the distribution of
cultural materials, was estimated at 60 by 25 meters. Shovel probes
revealed little in the way of cultural material on either side of the
road.
It appeared that, while road construction exposed the material
that led to the recording of the site, it also destroyed some of the
cultural deposits.
What was observed in the eroded gully may be all
that is left of any consequence, but the cache and its location on a
rise in the floodplain may prove significant in further testing of a
larger area.

All eleven specimens are the products of splitting off primary

sheared cone which would suggest the use of an anvil to split the
cobbles.
With the exception of two flakes (Fig. 5.3 & 5.12), either
hinge or feather terminations were noted on the distal ends. Only two
flakes (Fig. 5.6 & 5.10) appear to be from the same cobble. The
remaining nine are from various cherts.
Length, measured from the
cone to the distal end, ranged from 6.5 to 10 centimeters, with the
average being 7.5 centimeters.
41FY316
This site sits on top of a knoll approximately 25 meters east of
the confluence of Violets and Cummins creeks, on the southeast side of
Violets Creek. The soils on the knoll are Falba series fine sandy
loams (SCS 1981).
The site lies in an improved pasture, with short
grasses and scattered post oak the dominant vegetation.

In addition, the area has been cleared in the

41FY319
This site, lying along the eastern terrace of Violets Creek about
150 met~rs northeast of its confluence with Cummins Creek, is within
50 meters of 41FY316 and separated by a shallow gully. The site is in
improved pasture with scattered oak.
Soils are Tremona series
gravelly loamy fine sands (SCS 1979). Although surface scatter was
light, shovel probes revealed cultural material to 60 centimeters,
indicating more substantial deposits than were suggested by surface
remains. One late Middle Archaic and one Late Archaic dart point were
among the surface finds, placing occupation at the site sometime
between 2250 and 1250 BP. Other artifacts observed included three
bifacial cores, several secondary and tertiary flakes, one primary
flake, and burned rock. The majority of the artifacts were turned up
in shovel probes. Based on the distribution of surface and subsurface
deposits, site size was estimated at 50 by 100 meters. Disturbances
to the site include erosion and clearing.

This site is on the western bank of Violets Creek, 300 meters
downslope and across the creek from 41FY320. Cultural materials found
in the present stream bed suggest that the drainage channel has

CUMMINS CREEK

changed since the site was occupied.
The deposits are buried in
Tremona gravelly loamy fine sands (SCS 1979) which support a thick
growth of intrusive weeds and scattered live oak trees. The ground
surface has been recently scraped, revealing numerous artifacts as
well as a hearth lying amid exposed gravels. Several diagnostic
artifacts were found laying around the hearth,
including
two
Pedernales basal fragments, one complete Middle Archaic point, one
Darl mahomet style dart point and two unidentifiable dart point
fragments.
These indicate occupation during the Middle Archaic and
Late Archaic periods (between 4600 and 1250 BP).
Numerous flakes,
bifacial
tools, bifacial cores, burned rock, and one possible
prismatic blade were also observed. Surface scatter covered an area
50 by 80 meters to the west of the hearth, and subsurface probes
revealed cultural material to a depth of at least 60 centimeters in
unscraped areas. The site has been partially disturbed by bulldozers
clearing for pasture, which has enhanced erosion of the exposed soils.

This site was found on a rise or natural levee in the floodplain
of Cummins Creek near its confluence with Cedar Creek. The site lies
in a cleared pasture where Bermuda grass and annual forbes dominate
the vegetation;
it is edged by the riverine forest of post oak,
cedar, yaupon and wild rose bordering Cummins Creek. Soils are Falba
variant loamy fine sands (SCS 1981).
Artifacts were observed in
rodent backdirt, concentrated in the southwestern corner atop the
rise, and eroding from the gentle slope down to the floodplain.
Tertiary and secondary flakes, burned rock chips and cobble fragments,
several cores, one biface fragment and a single bone tempered sherd
were distributed over an area approximately 110 by 55 meters in size.

38

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

A shovel probe in the area of highest artifact concentration, near the
location of the sherd, uncovered a hearth at a depth of
20
centimeters.
Cultural debris in this and other probes continued to a
depth of 60 centimeters. The presence of the ceramic sherd suggests
that this large, open campsite was occupied during the Toyah phase of
the Late Prehistoric (650
200 BP).
The site appeared largely
intact, with some damage due to downslope erosion.
Artifacts:
Pottery Rim Sherd
Black interior with grayish exterior.
Preliminary petrographic
analysis of the sherd indicated that the particles and pore space in
this thin section are distributed homogeneously throughout.
Pore
space covers 7 to 10% of the section, scattered through a dense, dark
grayish-brown ceramic matrix in patchy voids as long
as
.75
millimeter.
Quartz covers 30 to 40% of the section, ranging widely
from silt - (.Olmm) to coarse sand sized (.88mm) particles. The silt
and very fine quartz particles are rounded in shape, but the large
coarse sand sized particles are angular and sub-angular.
The very
coarse sized fragments of bone identified in the megascopic analysis
of the sherd nere not seen in the slide, and were probably pulled out
in the grinding of the thin section. Bone fragments of smaller, more
resistant sizes were not observed in the section.
41FY364
This site is on a rise which
parallels
Cummins
Creek,
approximately 300 meters upstream from the confluence with Cedar
Creek. The site lies in an improved pasture of Bermuda grass and
annual forbes, bordered by post oak and yaupon woodlands. Soils are
Falba loamy fine sands (SCS 1981).
Cultural debris was dispersed
across an area 115 by 45 meters in size and consisted of a dense
scatter of secondary and tertiary flakes, burned rock chips and cobble
fragments, most of which were below the surface. A complete biface
preform, one biface medial fragment with dulling along the lateral
edges and three other chert biface fragments were also observed
eroding from the creek bank.
No diagnostic artifacts or cultural
features were found. Subsurface materials, which reached a depth of
50 centimeters, were mixed with dense stream gravels, suggesting
redeposition or heavy disturbance.
Erosion has also affected the
site.

UPLAND SITES
These two sites were selected for testing based on their
physiographic location and their potential for comparison of the
uplands and creek aligned campsites.
41FY378
This site is in an open field approximately 75 meters northwest
of Albers Branch of Shaw Creek. Low grasses and weeds cover the site,
which is bordered by creekside forest of cedar, post oak and yaupon
holly. Soils are Falba fine sandy loams (SCS 1981). Material culture
consisted of a large scatter of flakes, tools and burned rock covering
an area 80 by 55 meters in size, with deposits reaching depths of 60
centimeters or more. The site has been previously collected by the
landowner, Mrs. Berger. Artifacts in her collection indicate probable
occupation from the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric (4600 - 650
BP).
The site is now fenced but had previously been plowed and is
somewhat affected by erosion.
41FY380
This site is on the trest of a knoll approximately 300 meters
north of an unnamed tributary to Shaw Creek. The knoll is in an area
high weeds and low grasses comprise
the
of cleared pasture;
vegetation. Soils at the site are Falba variant loamy fine sands (SCS
1981). The fair sized lithic scatter consisted of secondary and
tertiary flakes and burned rock chips and cobbles covering an area
approximately 50 by 60 meters in size and reaching a depth of 60
centimeters in the shovel probes.
The site has been disturbed by
erosion, as well as by clearing, bioturbation and nearby oil well
construction.

RABBS CREEK BASIN SITES
Twenty sites have been selected for testing in the Rabbs Creek
Basin.
Many of these are believed to be spring oriented encampments.
Temporally diagnostic material at many of these sites indicated
multicomponent occupations dating from 8500 BP.
Three are small
campsites with subsurface deposits that could lead to a determination
of site function.

41FY325
This site is on a point of land formed by a north meander of a
tributary flowing west to Owl Creek.
This tributary is deeply
entrenched, with two to three meter high cutbanks. The soils on the
point are Falba variant loamy fine sands (SCS I98I). The vegetation
is primarily riverine forest of post oak and cedar with open areas of
short grasses and weeds. A hearth was exposed in the cutbank at the
northernmost end of the point. Flakes and burned rock were observed
along the east and northeast banks on the south side of the tributary.
A chert core and biface fragment were among the artifacts recorded.
Petrified wood flakes and four petrified wood tools were also noted.
Shovel probes revealed cultural material to a depth of 75 centimeters
along the eastern edges of the meander, where the majority of
materials appear to be concentrated. Overall site size was estimated
at 25 by 40 meters.
The site has been disturbed by erosion and
slumping.
4IFY326
41FY326 is located on a knoll situated in an open field.
Jones
Creek takes a southeast meander 25 meters from the site. The knoll is
on the southeast edge and lower s~opes of a southwest trending
interfluve separating Owl Creek to the northwest from Jones Creek to
the southeast. Soils in the area are Falba series fine sandy loams
(SCS 1981). Vegetation consists of short field grasses with isolated
cedar trees. The area may have been under cultivation at one time.
Two chert and one petrified wood core were observed, along with
tertiary flakes of both materials, burned rock and a single sandy
paste ceramic sherd (found below surface), which suggests a Late
Prehistoric occupation (650-200
BP)
of
this
open
campsite.
Distribution of materials extended over an area 120 by 110 meters;
and in shovel probes to a depth of one meter. The site appears to be
largely
intact, but erosion was noted and there may be some
disturbance due to plowing.
Artifacts:
Pottery Sherd
Black exterior and interior with a smooth surface on both faces.
During preliminary petrographic analysis, the first noticeable feature
of the sherd in thin section is that all particles and pore space are
distributed homogeneously throughout the section, with no clustering
toward the interior or exterior of the sherd. Pore space covers 30%
of the section in angular, patchy strips as long as one millimeter in
length.
These voids interrupt a reddish-brown ceramic matrix.
Sub-angular quartz grains cover 25% of the slide in a wide range of
sizes, from very fine (.lmm) to very coarse (I.Imm) sand sizes.
Another species cover 3 to 5% of the slide in fine to medium sized
sub-angular particles, and is probably volcanic tuff.

41FY327
This site lies on the outside of a southeast meander in Jones
Creek, between two north flowing tributaries. Located some fifty
meters from the creek, the site is forested with post oak and cedar
interspersed with short field grasses. Soils at the site are Falba
variant loamy fine sands (SCS 1981).
Heavy erosion made for high
visibility - among the numerous artifacts observed were a Nolan type
dart point and a point base reminiscent of the Meserve--type,
suggesting that the site was occupied during the Early Archaic and the
early Middle Archaic, between 8500 and 4600 BP.
Other artifacts
included petrified wood and chert flakes, one uniface scraper, one
Guadalupe gouge and one biface scraper. Distribution of materials led
to an estimation of site size at 135 by 60 meters. Shovel probes
revealed intact cultural deposits to a depth of 90 centimeters in the
remaining uneroded areas.
Much of the site, however, had been
bulldozed in order to lay pipes, resulting in heavy erosion.
Further
assessment of the site is contingent upon gaining access to
neighboring property.

consists of sparse short grasses and weeds. Chert and petrified wood
flakes, burned rock and three bifaces were scattered along an area 75
meters wide, paralleling the creek and the direction of the plow
furrows for some 175 meters. Subsurface deposits reached a depth of
80 centimeters to sterile clay. Artifacts noted included secondary
and tertiary flakes, a single core, a finished biface with noticeable
beveling at the tip, one thinned biface medial fragment, another

This site was found on a steeply sloped cutbank on the west side
of Owl Creek between two sharp eastward bends in the drainage. The
Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978) are deflated at the creek's bank
but become foliated upslope in a westerly direction. Vegetation
consists of post oak, cedar, yaupon holly, short grasses and weeds.
The main portion of the site rests atop a low rise which parallels the
creek approximately 25 meters from the bank.
Two possible hearths
were uncovered in shovel probes, both in areas of high artifact
concentration. Quantities of burned rock and numerous flakes were
found above and below the surface to a depth of about 90 centimeters.
A fragmentary biface and several cores and core fragments of opalized
wood were also observed. None of the artifacts noted were diagnostic
of occupation period. The site was estimated to extend over an area
some 260 by 75 meters in size. Portions of the site nearest the creek
bank were badly eroded from deflation and gullying, but deposits
further from the creek appeared to be fairly intact.

This site is atop the cutbank along the south side of the
northwest headwater branch of Blair Creek. Soils at the site are
Falba fine sandy loams (SCS 1981); creekside vegetation included post
oak and cedar, yaupon holly, wild grapes, annual forbes and grasses.
Cultural deposits were thickly distributed over an area 70 by 40
meters in size and reached a depth of more than 90 centimeters in the
shovel probes. Concentrations of burned rock suggesting hearths were
noted in the cutbank, in shovel probes and on the surface. A layer of
burned rock appeared to extend across the site at a depth of 60-70
centimeters below the surface. Additional artifacts observed included
large quantities of secondary and tertiary flakes of chert, petrified
wood and palmwood, one biface distal fragment and one chert core. No
artifacts assignable to a specific occupation period were found.
Gullying, sheetwash erosion and sloughing in the cutbariks have
disturbed this site, but the depth of the deposits suggests that much
is still intact.

This site is situated along the northwest cutbank of the
southeastern headwater tributary to Blair Creek about 50 meters north
of the confluence of the headwater branches. The site area is wooded
with post oak and cedar, with an understory of annual forbes and
grasses. Soils are Falba fine sandy loams (SCS 1981).
The densely
distributed cultural material included one Pedernales base and one
Bulverde dart point base, which indicate a Middle Archaic (4000 - 2600
BP) occupation of the site. Two biface tips, a moderate quantity of
chert, petrified wood and palmwood secondary and tertiary flakes and
an abundance of burned rock were also observed. A fairly discrete
hearth was eroding from the cutbank of the drainage and other
concentrations of burned rock were noted in gullies across the site 1 s
surface. In addition, burned rock was unearthed in shovel probes at a
depth of 60 to 70 centimeters. Surface and subsurface distribution of
cultural materials extended over an area approximately 80 by 35 meters
and reached a depth of 75 centimeters.
This site is similar to
41FY351 and 41FY352 further north on the same tributary, in its
creekside location, density of artifacts and the presence of a second,
subsurface layer of burned rock. The tentative placement of this site
in the Middle Archaic would date it between the apparent Early Archaic
and Late Prehistoric components at 41FY352.

This site is at the southern end of a divide between two unnamed
south flowing tributaries to Owl Creek.
The confluence of the
tributaries with Owl Creek lies approximately 150 meters south of the
site.
The end of the divide is an elevated area with slopes to the
south, east and west. It is heavily wooded in cedar, post oak,
blackjack oak and yaupon holly, with scattered clearings of short
grasses. Soils at the site are Tremona very gravelly loamy fine sands
(SCS 1979).
Cultural material was concentrated in two areas. The
largest covered approximately 110 by 50 meters along the southern and
eastern
sides
of
the divide.
Site depth in this area was
approximately 80 centimeters. Noted were a large quantity of chert
and petrified wood flakes, burned rock, one petrified wood and two
chert biface fragments, a quartzite hammerstone, three core remnants
and two chert dart points. One is a Wells type; the other is a Late
Archaic style. This puts two periods of the site's occupation within
the Archaic:
Early (7000-6000 BP) and Late (2250-1250 BP). The
second concentration of material was smaller and shallower, covering
approximately 100 by 40 meters along the southwestern slope of the
divide and reaching a depth of around 30 centimeters.
Cultural
material was more thinly distributed in this area. The site appeared

south flowing tributaries border the site on east and west. The site
area is thickly wooded in cedar, post oak, loblolly pine and yaupon

amounts of burned rock, mostly secondary and tertiary flakes of chert,
petrified wood and palmwood, two bifacial cores, one San Gabriel style
biface fragment found at 45 centimeters below surface and a single
dart point fragment which appears to date from the Middle Archaic.
Site occupation can be tentatively placed between the Middle and Late

This site is on a slope projection at the confluence of Owl Creek
and a primary tributary.
The area is densely wooded in cedar,
blackjack and post oak, yaupon holly and greenbriar, with occasional
clearings where sheetwash has exposed cultural deposits. Soils at the
site are Tremona very gravelly loamy fine sands (SCS 1979). Artifacts
were also exposed in the west bank of Owl Creek and the east bank of
the tributary, the interior sides of the 11 V11 formed by the confluence.
A large number of mostly tertiary flakes, both chert and petrified
wood, two chert cores and one chert biface fragment, the burned tip of
a projectile point, a dart point with tip missing and a moderate
amount of burned rock covered an area estimated at 130 by 90 meters in
size. Shovel probes revealed cultural material to a depth of at least
80 centimeters; one shovel probe encountered a concentration of
debitage at a depth of 60-70 centimeters below the surface. The dart
point is a Late Archaic variety which would date one occupation of the
site at 1400-1250 BP. Soils were more severely deflated on the slope
down to Owl Creek than toward the tributary, where the highest
concentrations of artifacts were found. The site was also disturbed
by sheetwash erosion and the cutbanks of the drainages.

yaupon holly, short weeds and grasses. The Tremona very gravelly
loamy fine sandy soils (SCS 1979) are badly eroded below the site
area, which is on high ground. The site is crossed by a fenceline;
material culture on the side surveyed is very light, consisting of
scattered burned rocks and mostly tertiary chert flakes. Site size is
estimated at 30 by 40 meters; the site probably continues on the
other side of the fence. Cultural material was found in shovel probes
to a depth of 36 centimeters. No diagnostic artifacts or cultural
features were observed.
This site has been disturbed by rodent
activity, marginal erosion, and the construction of the

This site is on a flat rise at the base of the southwestern
valley wall of Owl Creek, just above the floodplain. Much of the site
is cleared and covered in grasses and annual forbes; clusters of oak
and loblolly pine are scattered across the rise. Soils are Falba
series fine sandy loams (SCS 1981). Material culture appeared to be
concentrated toward the site center with thinner distribution across
the rest of the site. Cores seemed to be the most abundant artifact
type;
primary and secondary flakes dominated the debitage, though
tertiary flakes were also present. Burned rock was scattered across
the site.
A broken, opalized wood biface and an unidentified dart
point were found near the center of the site. The dart point suggests
the site was occupied during the Late Archaic Period (between 2250 1250 BP). Site size was estimated at 55 by 100 meters; however, the
area is divided by a fenceline, and the site may extend to the other,
unsurveyed side of the fence. Shovel probes revealed deposits to a
depth of 12 centimeters. The margins of the site, at the edge of the
rise and along the valley wall are heavily eroded, as are some areas
of the site surface.

Soils are Bunyan fine sandy loams (SCS 1980). The site covers a large
area, approximately 100 by 80 meters in size, but material culture is
rather thinly deposited. This consisted mainly of burned rock chips
scattered discontinuously on the surface and to a depth of 50
centimeters, a small quantity of secondary and tertiary chert flakes,
one chert core and one biface tip. None of the materials found were
diagnostic of occupation period. The site has been somewhat disturbed

Historic Background
The history of Fayette County has been the subject of several
thorough research reports (Lotto 1902; Weyand 1932; Weyand and Wade

documented and because much of it does not relate to the specific
survey area, these studies will not be reviewed here.

settlers in central Fayette County.
The first groups of settlers in Austin's colony were immigrants
from the southern United States, many of them attracted by the
generous size of the land grants and their relatively low cost. These
factors also made land speculation popular. Jesse H. Cartwright was
attempting to sell lots in Fayetteville as early as 1837 (Weyand
1932:88), even though that town was not actually founded for another
decade. Empressario Austin, who was, after all, in the business of
bringing in settlers for profit (he received payment from the Mexican
government in the form of land tracts, of a size based on the number
of emigrees brought in and settled within his grant) was inclined to
consider new sources for his settlers. Concerning the introduction of
Swiss and German families, he wrote, "They have not in genera 1 that
mania for speculation which is so prominent a trait in the English and
North American character, and above all they wil 1 oppose slavery 11
(Quoted in Barker 1925:254).
GERMAN SETTLEMENT
Domestic turmoil in nineteenth century Germany made emigration to
locations ~ttractive to many citizens. These conditions, a
complex blend of the effects of the Napoleonic Wars, empire/republic
political conflicts, severe business depressions and impractical
inheritance laws, were so oppressive to many that they led to open
revolution in the Rhenish Palantinate in 1832, in Frankfurt in 1833
and in Oberhessen that same year (Benjamin 1974:3).

these were influenced in their choice by books published by countrymen
familiar with America, such as the work of Gottfried Duden, first
published in 1829 and reprinted in several editions. It was this book
which convinced Friedrich Ernst, who had immigrated to New York in
1829, that his fortune lay in the Missouri territory described by
Duden. With his family, he sailed to New Orleans in 1831.
While
there, he discovered the league and labor land offer of the Mexican
government, made through its Texas empressarios, and took advantage of
the opportunity to come to Austin's colony. Once there, he wrote to a
friend in his native Oldenburg describing the benefits of life in the
colony and even gave a description of how to go about immigrating.
The letter was later printed in an Oldenburg newspaper and then widely
circulated in a book, Detlef Dunt's Reise Nach Texas. Dunt's comment
on Ernst's letter was as fol lows:

Several hundred Germans settled in Texas in the 1830s and early
1840s. News of these early arrivals and their subsequent destinations
were frequently reported in the Galveston and Â·Houston newspapers of
the day (Benjamin 1974:57).
Most of them were from the Duchy of
Oldenburg, Friedrich Ernst's former home, and they settled around the
town he founded on the west fork of Mill Creek in Austin County;
Industry, the first German settlement in Texas, or in small towns in
the same vicinity.
Ernst, and those who joined him early, settled
within the context of the Austin Colony and from the first were
subject to the influence of their Anglo neighbors, who had already
established the area's commercial, social and government functions.
Later immigrants came from a wider selection of German districts,
German influenced Central European countries, and German-French border
districts. It was this later, more diverse group who settled in the
study area. Thus, from the first the settlers came from a variety of
origins.
The second German settlement in Texas was founded by Joseph
Siegal, htmself a native of the French province of Lorraine, bordering
Germany. Siegal Settlement began in 1832 with Joseph's farm on Sand
Prairie Creek in southeast Fayette County, less than 10 miles south
southeast of the current study area (Carter and Ragsdale 1976).
The
Siegal Settlement's inhabitants arrived over a span of more than two
decades and came from a variety of German
states,
Denmark,
Switzerland, Austria, Poland and France.
This gradual arrival of
settlers is analogous to the settlement of Industry.
In short, the
study area's general neighborhood saw settlement which included an
initially small German element, along with other Central Europeans,
but which was predominantly Anglo. As individual immigrants came to
the area, the Germanic character of the population became more
pronounced, but remained diverse with respect to the areas of Central
Europe from which these settlers immigrated.
This is in contrast to the much more insularly German, en masse
immigration sponsored by the Society for the Protection of German
Immigrants in Texas (the Verein), an organization of German nobles
interested
in facilitating immigration while at the same time
preserving German culture in America. By the time the Verein had
commenced
its
operations, its representative in Texas, Prince
Solms-Braunfels, had informed his fellow noblemen that the Nassau
farm, a formerly Anglo plantation located southeast of the study area
which had been purchased by the Verein, was not suited to the purposes
of the colonization society.
It was in a neighborhood of prior
settlers and hence not adapted to establishing the Germans in a colony
by themselves to preserve their national customs (Solms, Letter, April
27, 1845).

58

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Similar group migrations of Germans to Texas and other locations
occurred during the flight of many intellectuals following the
unsuccessful revolution of 1848. The communities they set up were
like those of the Verein, insularly German, actively excluding other
settlers.
The differences between areas settled
by Germanic
group
migrations, for example the New Braunfels area, and those settled by
individuals such as the study area, have been extensively reported by
Jordan in German Seed in Texas Soil and can be summarized by stating
that the character of the-individually settled areas much more closely
resembles that found in Anglo settlements of the same period. Jordan
(1966:195) states ''The similarities observed between farmers of German
and southern origin were, in many ways, even more striking than the
differences."

Initial Survey Research Design
The historic research design for the initial survey of the
Cummins Creek Prospect (Nightengale and Jackson 1983:57-58) was a set
cf hypotheses, which, if supported by the data, would reinforce
Jordan's (1966:195) conclusions regarding the character of areas of
Texas settled via the staggered arrival of individual German/Central
European families. These hypotheses, and first survey results, were:
1.

The German settlers in the~ Cummins Creek area established ~
dispersed hamlet settlement pattern of small farms similar to
their Anglo-American neighbors.

The hypothesis was considered confirmed based on the small
separate farmsteads observed and the lack of evidence for the
establishment of a Central European agricultural village (Nightengale
and Jackson 1983:72).
Comment: The initial acquisition of land in the first (1983)
survey area was by Anglo-Americans. Subsequent subdivision of the
various grants and their piecemeal sale to other parties who occupied
and farmed them occurs nowhere earlier than 1854 and, in the majority
of cases, not until after the Civil War (Table 6).

German and other Central European immigrants could buy only such
land as was made available at the time of their arrival and thus had
little choice but to follow a settlement pattern not of their own
determination.
As individual families and not a consortium were
involved, land purchases were further limited by financial factors and
farm size kept small. The hypothesis was not retained for the current
survey due to the above factors and recognition that with the
diversity of immigrant origins, a number of settlers came from regions
where the dispersed hamlet pattern was indigenous (Jordan 1966:35).

house

The hypothesis was found incompletely confirmed, though the
majority of structures bore it out.
Four structures possessed
characteristics which, taken as a composite, appeared to offer the
possibility of a distinct folk type house, identified with a
German-Texas building tradition (Nightengale and Jackson 1983:73).
This hypothesis was retained for the current survey to further inquire
into the characteristics and antecedents of the generalized composite
house proposed as a distinct type.
3.

The German settlers adopted the general farming practices and crop
'"Patterns of the Anglo farmers, depending heavily on cotton and
corn as staple crops.

This hypothesis was given support by data derived from the
agricultural census records of 1860.
The group of predominantly
German farmers in the Elias Gilpin grant, roughly the Bell Settlement
(so called because most of the farms were purchased from land
speculator James C. Bell), were farming cotton and corn as their major
crops.
Comment: It was noted in the 1983 survey results that the crop
yield achieved was, for these small farms, less than that recorded by
Jordan in his study of the crops raised by Austin County German
farmers in 1860 (Jordan 1966:66-69). This was attributed to the poor
productivity of soil involved.

The size of the Austin County farms used by Jordan in his study
is not expressed in the referenced work. Thus, the greater crop
yields noted in that study may represent greater acreage farmed as
much as soil productivity.
The figures used by Jordan for corn
represent bushels per farm and, for cotton, bales per farm, unequated
to acreage. The Cummins Creek, Bell Settlement figures are for twelve
farms averaging only 12.75 cultivated acres each (see Table 7,
Nightengale and Jackson 1983:51).
It is noted that the highest
production of both corn and cotton among these farms was achieved by
the only farmer, Carl Kruse, with no milch cows grazing on his
property and that the production of both crops on the larger (250
improved acres) farm of Anglo George W. Thompson almost tripled

Settlement, one farmer had acquired his land in 1856, but those who
bought from Bell had to acquire theirs after 1857 (Nightengale and
Jackson 1983:50). Bell was still owner of 67 unsold acres at the time
of the 1860 census. Thus no farm had been established for more than
four years and the bulk of them had operated three years or less at

CUMMINS CREEK

61

the time of the census.
By the 1870 census, eight of the twelve
farmers shown in the 1860 census were still operating. Total improved
acreage for these eight in 1870 exceed that of 1860 by only eight
acres, 105 to 97, yet the number of bushels of corn harvested in 1870
is 750 as contrasted with only 279 in 1860. Similarly, the cotton
grown by these farmers in 1870 was 31 bales versus 10 bales in 1860.
It would appear that time since the establishment of the farms was a
major factor in productivity and that the 1860 figures are not an
accurate
barometer of soil fertility (Nightengale and Jackson
1983:Table 7).
That corn and cotton were major staple crops among the Bell
Settlement farmers appears to be upheld and the basic hypothesis
supported. The hypothesis was retained for this survey to be further
tested by noting the emphasis on cotton and corn production by German
farmers located within the study area.
4.

The ratio of oxen to horses among the German farmers is
to that of Anglo farmers.

identical

The hypothesis was considered confirmed in the first survey data,
wherein no significant difference between the Bell Settlement area
ox/horse ratio (Nightengale and Jackson 1983:75) and that of Austin
County (Jordan 1966:84) was found.
Comment: The significance of the ratio of horses to oxen is
based on the presumed use of both as draft animals of overlapping
utility with the selection of one or the other a matter of choice on
the part of the farmer. Since all horses are not used as heavy draft
animals, some being used only as mounts, brood mares or light harness
teams, and little use other than heavy draft tasks exist for oxen, it
is not clear that comparison of census entries showing all horses and
only those cattle which were oxen can be reduced to a ratio
representative of a farmer's choice of work animals.
The ratio
implies interchangeability but the data does not single out those

livestock ranching is involved, the ox is not a suitable substitute
for the horse. In view of the conformance of the 1860 vintage data
with that of Jordan's Austin Colony study, it is apparent that the
study area has this ratio in common with neighboring areas settled
under similar circumstances.
The real usefulness of the horse/ox
ratio is to show the differences between group settled, more isolated
areas and those settled piecemeal in areas initially Anglo controlled.
The utility of the ratio lessens with time
because
of
the
unsuitability of oxen to farm machinery and the decline in their use
(Jordan 1966:143). By the outbreak of the Civil War the percentage of
farmers reporting ownership of horses, German or Anglo, was about
equal (Jordan 1966:143-144).

62

HISTORIC RESOURCES

The foregoing is not intended to give the impression that the
initial Anglo settlement of the area was followed by an erratic but
persistent wave of Germans which displaced the majority of the
original settlers.
Anglo settlement in the general area continued
throughout the period of German immigration.
Moreover, starting in
the 1850s, a steady stream of Bohemian settlers came into the general
area, founding the towns of Dubina, Praha and Nechanitz, the latter
within the study area, and settling so heavily in Fayetteville and
Ellinger as to constitute a majority in those towns (Williams 1976:26,
27).
Additionally, at the close of the Civil War the freedmen of the
county which elected to stay there added a further element to the
population.
The 1870 U.S. Agricultural Census for part of the study
area shows Blacks with birthplaces in Georgia, Virginia, Alabama,
Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana (USDA 1870:11, 12). The real
settlement circumstances are similar to that of a patchwork quilt,
pieced together over a several decade time span and composed of
unequally sized and readily distinguishable elements with a limited
tendency to fully integrate with each other. Fayette County had a
population of 3,756 in 1850 (Kingston 1984:344). Olmstead, writing in
1860 but referring to figures gathered in 1857, places the number of
German inhabitants in the county at one third the population and then
cites an obviously rounded off figure of 1,000 as an estimate of their
numbers (Olmstead 1860:428 footnote).
The German population was
obviously sufficient to impart a definite Germanic flavor to the
county but did not constitute a majority or even a plurality of its
citizens.
This is in sharp contrast to such counties as Comal,
Gillespie, Medina, Victoria and Colorado where the German element was
the heavy majority.
It should al so be recognized that 11 German 11
emigration to Fayette County spans a time during which that country
which is now the two Germanies, was still a non-unified collection of
independent principalities, kingdoms, duchies and free cities.
Each
of these independent political entities made its own laws, conducted
its own foreign affairs and had its own army, tariffs, and even its
own coinage.
It took a series of wars with Denmark (1864), Austria
(1866) and France (1870-71) for Bismarck to militarily achieve
unification.
The German Empire had been tornÂ· into many separate political
entities as a result of the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) almost two
centuries before any emigration to Texas.
It
is
reasonable,
therefore,
to expect that the unqualified term 11 German 11 , when
referring to cultural traits of the nineteenth century, has about as
much meaning as 11 American 11 does when unqualified, each term giving the
impression of country wide affinity when in fact the trait may be
considerably more local. Fayette County and the study area received
separated
principalities.
immigrants from a number of widely
Immigrants from Oldenburg, Mecklenburg, Hanover, Hesse-Cassal, Saxony,
Baden and unspecified portions of Prussia were listed in the 1870
Agricultural Census data for those living in the post office district
of Waldeck hamlet (USDA 1870:9-13). Jordan states that 11 agricultural
practices and rural settlement form differed considerably from one

CUMMINS CREEK

63

part of Germany to another in the last century, and in order to
understand the farming heritage of the Texas Germans, attention must
be directed to the agricultural systems of the specific areas from
which they come" (Jordan 1966:33). The diversity in Germanic origins
seen in the study area coupled with the admixture of other settlers of
non-Germanic origin all set in a new environment presents the
opportunity for cultural trait amalgams and blends whose clear roots
are difficult to ascertain.
Material cultural resources within the study area can be expected
to have characteristics that reflect this diversity of backgrounds,
adaptations to local conditions, adoption of competing methods and
materials better suited to those conditions, and the discarding of
traits which were appropriate in a former locale but which are
incompatible in the new one. Jordan cites a list of more than a dozen
agricultural practices which were either quickly discarded or never
introduced to Texas by Germanic immigrants (Jordan 1966:196-198) and
it is reasonable to believe that the list could easily be extended by
considering customs beyond those of an agricultural nature. Several
practices among those cited by Jordan as discarded or never introducP.d
are particularly pertinent when considering the study area. These
are:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Winter housing of livestock
Large farmstead structures
Farm villages
Stall feeding of livestock

All of these have a direct effect on the quantity, type, size,
architectural style, physical placement, and material components of
farm buildings and structures. Hypothesis IV was considered confirmed
and was not retained for this survey.
Land Grants, Early Roads and Settled Communities
Figure 9 depicts the present and prior study areas on a map of
the original land grants. Early roads are also shown. The Wilbarger
Trace runs north and south roughly half way between the hamlets of
Waldeck and Nechanitz. The Washington-Bastrop road, known also as the
Goucher Trace, cuts through the Green DeWitt grant. The oldest road
is the La Bahia Road, which passes by the study area about three miles
southeast of its border.
It was popularly referred to as the
Opelousas Road, or the Lower Road, during the nineteenth century and
figured prominently in the cattle drive era.
These roads are
discussed in more detail in the earlier report (nightengale and
Jackson 1983:47-48). Minor sections of these old roads are still in
use as county roads but most stretches are long abandoned and are
almost untraceable on the ground today.

64

HISTORIC RESOURCES

After the railroad passed through the area and spawned the town
of Ledbetter in 1870, the primary focus of through traffic and farm to
market transportation was on the road that was built between LaGrange
and Ledbetter. This road, now FM 1291, passes through both Nechanitz
and Waldeck.
LAND GRANTS
A number of the land grants involved in the previous survey
(Nightengale and Jackson 1983) extend into the current survey area
(see Fig. 9), including those of William Nabors, Nicholas Taylor,
J.G. Wilkinson, John Vanderworth, Green DeWitt and Henry Craig. The
first two listed are wholly within the area of the combined surveys
while the latter four encompass considerable acreage not included in
either study area. The current survey adds to these the Montraville
Wood, Benjamin White, and Edward Powitzky grants plus about a third of
the G. W. Brazeale grant and minor acreage in the J.P. Longley,
William Williamson, and Amaziah Baker grants. Later grants maintained
the basic system but with greater emphasis on the even 320 acre 1344
varas square and digressions into smaller even acre sizes. Though
most grants are roughly rectangular, a few, such as that of Edward
Powitzky, appear to have been the result of surveying error or
anomaly. The irregular land ownership mosaic produced by these grants
is readily apparent (see Fig. 9).
The initial distribution and subsequent disposition of the land
grants had a direct effect on the settlement options available to
immigrants to the study area. Initial settlement of the various land
areas was sporadic and spread over several decades. Some lands were
patented long after warrants were issued while others were available
immediately.
Some were immediately transferred to speculators and
held for long periods while others were kept
unoccupied
for
generations of families before finally being purchased by those who
would live on the land. Most of those held for speculation were sold
piecemeal over several years when they finally came on the market.
The net effect was that settlement of a given tract is directly
related to the circumstances of original ownership, and the pattern of
settlement to the time when the land became available for subdivision.
Original ownership could be the result of an Austin Colony/Mexican
government grant, a Republic of Texas headright or bounty, or a State
of Texas patent recognizing one of the foregoing. The result is an
area which received settlers from several generations of immigrants,
the later among these occupying land contemporarily with the first and
even the second American generations of families which originated in a
number
of
European locations.
The settlement pattern of the
independently/individually settled study area has much more time depth
to be considered than others settled by organized groups within what
is sometimes referred to as the "German Belt" of Texas.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

The circumstances of grant acquisition and subsequent disposition
of those grants and surveys lying wholly or partially within the
current study area are summarized below.
The William Nabors Grant
This survey included 667 acres of the William Nabors 1476.13 acre
grant. The land was patented to the grantee on April 23, 1841. Still
owned by Nabors in 1860, by 1868 it had passed to land speculators
(Fayette County tax records).
By 1879 much of the property (1,275
acres) was owned by Julius Weishuhm, Sr. who lived on acreage he had
acquired in the adjacent Wilkinson grant. Weishuhm is cited without
further comment by Lotto as being among the old settlers of the
Nechanitz hamlet area (Lotto 1902:400). He is the owner of only 400
acres in 1870 (U.S. Agricultural Census:ll) half of that was in the
Wilkinson grant.
Thus between 1870 and 1879 he acquired just over
1,000 acres of the Nabors grant 30 to 39 years after it was patented.
A tax evaluation of only $368 was placed on the 1,275 acres of former
Nabors' land in 1879, about 29 cents an acre. The Wilkinson grant 200
acres was evaluated at $1,000 or $5 an acre. This contrast is
strongly suggestive of the undeveloped, unimproved nature of the
Nabors grant property at the time. The Nabors grant land produced one
historic site recorded during the survey, 41FY383. It is described in
a later section of this report.
The Nicholas Taylor and Montraville Wood Grants
Portions of these grants were surveyed during the first field
season.
Both are Bounty grants for military service to the Republic
of Texas. Both lie along the Lee County line in the extreme northern
portion of the study area.
The Wood bounty warrant was issued in
1849, thirteen years after the military service on which it was based
and not exercised to claim this land until 1877 (Miller 1967:700).
The Goacher Trace had been in use as a road, cutting across the
southern portion of the parcel, for almost 50 years before the land
was claimed from the public domain.
The Taylor tract was claimed
earlier but both tracts are gravelly, agriculturally unproductive
lands. No recordable historic structures or sites were found on
either parcel during this survey season.
The Henry Craig Grant
As noted in the earlier report (Nightengale and Jackson 1983:54),
this 1475.83 acre grant was held by a land speculation partnership and
remained intact through the last half of the nineteenth century.
Two
houses were recorded on the portion covered by the first field season.
The site of the second building to house the Bell Settlement school
(41FY400) was located on this grant during the second field season.

district serving primarily those persons living on lands within the

students from neighboring grants (Williams
1976:80-84). One of seven single teacher schools in the thirteen

school in that district (Williams 1976:81).
The school
still
functioned
in
the
mid-1940s but has since fallen victim to
consolidation.
The Benjamin White and James B.

Longley Grants

Both of these grants are third class headrights of the 320 acre
nominal size.
The White grant was patented in 1845 but was not
occupied. Just after the Civil War it was one of many purchased by
land speculator Nathaniel Faison of LaGrange. The Longley Grant was
patented to the grantee in 1842 and was purchased in 1847 by James
P. Hudson who had extensive land holdings. Faison, who had been an
agent for Hudson 1 s estate, became owner of record by 1860.
Faison's
-heirs continued speculating throughout the 1870s. This grant was part
of the holdings of a partnership, White and Bradshaw, in 1879 and its
estimated
tax
value of $500 in 1882 indicates that at that
comparatively late date it was still undeveloped.
Neither g~ant
produced a recordable historic site or structure during this survey.
The Edward Powitzky Grant
This small, nominally 160 acre, third class headright was
patented to the grantee on February 26, 1861. Powitzky, a Prussian by
birth, is not shown as a property owner in the census data for 1860.
He is listed as owner of 157 acres of unimproved woods in the 1870
U.S. Agricultural census. By 1879, the property was owned by James
Lambert, apparently to be held speculatively. Lambert did not even
render it for taxes in 1881 and 1882. No historic sites or structures
were located within the grant during survey.
The Amaziah Baker League
The Baker League is one of those granted by the Austin Colony in
1835. Only the extreme northwest corner is included in the study area
and no recordable sites or structures were found there by the field
crew.
The Green C.

DeWitt Survey (Abstract 164)

Roughly half of this large grant was surveyed during the first
field season. The second season involved an additional portion (Fig.
9) to the east. Because Green C. DeWitt was one of the colonial
empressarios, like Stephen F. Austin, considerable space in the first
report was devoted to a history of this and another grant in his name
(Nightengale and Jackson 1983:48-50). To summarize, DeWitt was dead

68

HISTORIC RESOURCES

when the land was granted in his name to his heirs.
It was settled
only after the Civil War when it was subdivided in connection with the
railroad construction and the resulting development of the town of
Ledbetter commencing in 1870. Only one structure was recorded in the
DeWitt grant during the second season. The old railroad station house
from nearby Carmine has been moved onto this land and reused for hay
storage. It was assigned site number 41FY410.
The William Williamson League
This Austin Colony grant was made under Mexican law in 1831,
making it the earliest granted parcel in the study area. Only a small
That small parcel
segment lies within the survey area (Fig. 9).
contains a single recordable house, 41FY409. An age greater than
fifty years was attributed to the basic structure although the house
has been heavily remodeled and modern additions made.
The George W. Brazeale Grant
About one third of this 3,129.36 acre grant was surveyed during
the current survey.
The large first class headright grant was
patented in 1845 but by 1849 more than two thirds of it was unrendered
for taxes and listed as owner unknown. By 1860 land speculators
Nathaniel Faison and John H. Moore owned more than 2,200 acres between
them and by 1868 a third speculator, A. Klicust, had purchased enough
acreage such that only two small farms aggregating less than 300 acres
of this tract were non-speculatively held.
Neither of the small
owners still held their property by 1880 by which time Faison and
Moore owned property included 2,920 acres with Moore having gained
control of more than two thirds of the grant. At this time only one
farm, that of J.M. Williard, seems to have been in operation.
Williard tilled 22 of his 100 acres. Another 100 acre holding was not
rendered for taxes by an absentee owner, W. Combs. The grant was
never heavily subdivided into many small farm holdings and has
relatively few owners even today.
The field crew recorded five
historic sites within the Brazeale grant land surveyed (see Historic
Resources section).
The J.G. Wilkinson Grant
The study area of the two Cummins Creek surveys includes nearly
all of the northern one third of this league. Original title to the
league was granted in 1835 by the Austin Colony under Mexican law.
The Wilbarger Trace roughly defines the eastern boundary of the
4,428.4 acre grant. By 1880 the grant had been subdivided into more
than 35 holdings ranging from one half acre to 546 acres in size.
Within the study area segment of the grant lies the village of
Nechanitz which is discussed separately in this report. Six historic
sites were recorded within the general Nechanitz area.

CUMMINS CREEK

The John Vanderworth League
This 4,428 acre first class headright grant was patented to the
grantee in 1848.
Vanderworth, even before patenting it, sold the
league to Otto von Roeder, a DeWitt County
land
speculator.
Undivided, the land was then sold to John York in 1855. York's death,
also in 1855, resulted in the entire league being sold in 1856 to
Robert Zapp of La Grange (Fayette County Clerk, Deed Book 0:88, 447).
Zapp, born in Elberfeld, Germany, had come to Texas in 1847, moved to
La Grange in 1848 and established a mercantile business there in 1855.
In 1859, Zapp moved his business to his Vanderworth league property,
in what is now Waldeck, then called Long Prairie (Lotto 1902:6, 304).
The early purchasers of Zapp's Vanderworth land were
not
exclusively of German origin, eight of his first 17 sales were to
Anglo farmers. Zapp's sales slowed during the Civil War, during which
he simultaneously maintained a strong Union bias while serving as
First Sergeant of a reserve state infantry company (Lotto 1902:304;
Weyand and Wade 1936:271). Zapp remained in the mercantile business
at Waldeck from 1859 to 1867, and continued to sell off property.
In
1867 he opened branch stores in Roundtop and Ledbetter, sold the Long
Prairie (Waldeck) store to Wenzel Matejowsky and Reinhardt Aschen and
moved to Roundtop (Lotto 1902:271, 304). By 1880 Zap~'s land interest
within the league was reduced to acting as agent for only 250 acres
while 39 other land owners or agents are shown on the tax assessor's
abstract for the league (Fayette County Tax Assessor's Abstract
312:1880).
By this time owners with Germanic surnames far outnumber
all others and include some of the descendents of Zapp's early
customers. For example, Gerhard Albers purchased 145 acres in 1860 at
which time he had three sons and two daughters. By 1880 Albers had
died, his wife had remarried and had subsequently passed away and two
of the sons owned 236 acres within the league.
The absence of
non-German
surname owners
can,
in
part,
be attributed to
Reconstruction days when the generally Union supporting Germans had an
advantage over Anglos who had supported the Confederacy. Many of the
latter, disenfranchised as citizens by law into the 1870s, sold their
property and left or were forced to sell for economic reasons. Their
more fortunate neighbors and newly arrived Europeans were
the
beneficiaries.
During the survey 14 historic sites were recorded
within the Vanderworth league (see Historic Resources section).
In summary, most of the land included in the most recent survey
was not settled early, but held for speculative purposes until well
after the Civil War. It owes its irregular rectangular pattern to the
policies and land measuring system of the Mexican government as
exercised through the empressarios and continued through the era of
the Texas Republic. The earliest land owners were, without exception,
Anglos; most of which resided elsewhere.
Only the Vanderworth
league, among the land grants involved in this survey, saw any
appreciable settlement prior to the eve of the Civil War.

COMMUNITIES OF THE EXTENDED STUDY AREA
Waldeck Village
The village of Waldeck is located at the periphery of the study
area just outside the buffer zone. It lies within the Vanderworth
League, 14 miles north northeast of LaGrange.
Ownership of the
property,
as stated previously, passed from the grantee to a
speculator and in 1856 to LaGrange store owner, Robert Zapp.
Zapp
began sales of property in the Waldeck area and opened a store at that
location in 1859. The location was, at this point, referred to as
Long Prairie, after the physiographic area in which it lay. The name
was retained when Zapp was appointed post master for the area in 1860.
Zapp continued to operate the store and sell off segments of the

sequence, the post office function was discontinued, Zapp opened
branch stores in Roundtop and Ledbetter, and sold the Long Prairie
store to W. Matejowsky and R. Aschen. A year later Aschen operated
the store and its post office function had been re-estab1ished with
Aschen as Postmaster (Lotto 1902:394; Wheat ms.:880). In 1862 Long
Prairie (later Aschen's store and still later Waldeck) became a voting
district serving about half those who had previously voted at
Roundtop. The 50 votes cast there in the August 4, 1862 election of
state and county officials gives some measure of how far settlement
had proceeded (Lotto 1902:311-312). The voting district was, in 1900,
composed of the Vanderworth League, the Williamson League and the
Mason and Baugh surveys, and prior to 1878 included the study area
leagues and surveys at to and beyond its bounds to the southwest

Voters registered and passed in line to voting booths after proving

difficulty involved in getting to the county seat, served to radically
reduce the total vote. When the Reconstruction Era ended in the early
1870s and voting in local districts resumed, the voter totals for
Waldeck - Aschen's Store were as follows:

The 1876 election voting total may be the result of its occurrence at
the time when both the Williamson and Vanderworth leagues were at
their most divided in terms of small farms recently purchased from
speculators and following the railroad's arrival. The subsequent
founding of Nechanitz and its establishment as a district polling
place resulted in the reduced totals seen in 1878 and thereafter right
up to the turn of the century.
Waldeck is essentially a convenience location established by
Robert Zapp.
It provided the mercantile essentials from 1859 on,
adding postal service, voting precinct, social, church, school,
cemetery, ginning, blacksmith and molasses press as demand developed.
In 1876, it lost its postal function to nearby Nechanitz which really
wasn't that much of a change since the postmaster there was the same
Wenzel Matejowsky who had purchased Zapp's store along with Reinhardt
Aschen.
The move may have been more a matter of convenience for
whoever was postmaster, than representative of a change in the postal
community.
Afterwards, Waldeck held its general service functions
until increased ease of travel and transport to LaGrange, the Fayette
County seat, Roundtop and other larger railroad towns, eroded their
support. During the middle years of the present century, the ginning,
molasses press, school and much of the mercantile functions were lost

72

HISTORIC RESOURCES

to other locations and the smithy was rendered obsolete.
Church,
cemetery, and other social functions were curtailed by the increased
ease of fulfilling them elsewhere. The same circumstances apply to
Nechanitz, Warrenton and Walhalla; the first within the study area
and the latter two within five miles distance. Each had a store, gin,
molasses press, smithy, church and were once postal and voting
locales. Each, in common with innumerable other small villages
outside the current commercial and governmental centers, suffered the
loss of some functions and the diminution of others and now serve the
local area to the extent that proximity makes the service convenient.
Recording of sites within Waldeck was accomplished to the extent
owner permission was attained. Much of the property is privately held
and not subject to the study sponsor's control.
Nechanitz Village
Nechanitz was the second hamlet to form within the Long Prairie
area.
It lies about 11 miles north northwest of LaGrange and less
than three air miles from Waldeck.
Nechanitz is within the broad
study area but outside the buffer and mining zones. Here also, much
of the property is in private hands cut of the sponsor's control.
The town is named for Nechanitz, Bohemia, the birthplace of its
founder Wenzel Matejowsky (also spelled Matajowski and Matajowsky in
archival records). Matejowsky came to Texas from his native Bohemia
in 1850 at the age of 21. After a short stint at farming in Austin
County he moved, in 1852, to Bastrop and established a cigar factory.
In 1855 he moved to Long Prairie, buying property within the John G.
Wilkinson League and returned to farming.
In 1867 he bought, in
partnership with Rienhardt Aschen, the Waldeck mercantile store of
Robert Zapp (Lotto 1902:271, 304). While Aschen continued to operate
the former Zapp location at Long Prairie/Waldeck, Matejowsky appears
to have begun operating a branch at Long Prairie/Nechanitz.
Just as
Aschen
succeeded
Zapp as Postmaster at the Waldeck location,
Matejowsky, in 1873, became Postmaster at Nechanitz. The two postal
facilities operated simultaneously for about 2 1/2 years and then, in
1876, Matejowsky at Nechanitz assumed responsibility for the whole
Long Prairie area.
Waldeck, as an incorporated hamlet in Long Prairie, had been in
existence since Robert Zapp opened his business there in 1859.
Nechanitz' identity commences with postal functions assumed in 1873
and separation from Waldeck (for a time both were called Long Prairie)
occurs by the election of 1878 with the establishment of two voting
precincts.
Some voters, previously served by Aschen's Store, were
polled at Nechanitz beginning in 1878 and both hamlets became polling
locations for specified land grant based districts. The dividing line
was the Wilkinson - Vanderworth, Nabors
Baugh survey line (see
Fig. 9).
Voter participation in Waldeck went from 135 in 1876 to 39

CUMMINS CREEK

73

in 1878. In the latter year, its first as a voting locale, Nechanitz
recorded 80 voters. Subsequent records show Nechanitz, in consonance
with the sale of speculative lands, reached a voter high of 101 in
1880 when 69 voted in Waldeck.
However, Waldeck voting levels
remained relatively constant for more than a decade while Nechanitz
rapidly declined from its peak to half its former size in the same
period.
Like Waldeck, Warrenton, Walhalla and several other towns in the
vicinity, Nechanitz consisted of a store, gin, church, smithy,
polling
cemetery, school grouping with governmental postal and
functions.
Occasionally other facilities, such as a lodge hall at
Waldeck, an additional store and a saloon at Warrenton, were added
central place facilities.
Matejowsky's extensively remodeled home is still occupied by some
of his descendents.
His original store was destroyed by fire. The
business continues in a recent building constructed across the road
from the earlier one. Th~ house and store were recorded during the
survey as were other appropriate sites where access was granted by the
owners.
By the 1880s the ethnic background of most study ar~a residents
was German American, a result of the blending of Germanic and central
European cultural traits with local ones.
Jordan, Bean and Holmes
(1984) cite the differences between German and German American Texan
in a range of cultural traits, including architecture, linguistics and
farming practices.
They describe the cultural - ethnic region in

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Results Relative to the Historic Research Design
The four hypotheses implemented in the historic research design
during the first Cummins Creek survey (Nightengale and Jackson 1983),
were altered as a result of that study 1 s findings.
Hypothesis 1,
concerned with settlement pattern, was considered confirmed by the
first survey data. It is commented upon earlier in this report and
was not retained for the second survey. Hypothesis 2, which dealt
with German building methods and vernacular house types, was deemed
incompletely confirmed by the first survey and is addressed again
herein. Hypothesis 3, concerned with corn and cotton as the stable
crops grown by German settlers, was supported by the first survey
results and is commented on earlier in this report. It is retained in
this report and addressed below. Hypothesis 4 was concerned with the
draft animal oxen to horse ratios used by Jordan (1966). According to
Jordan, these ratios help distinguish areas that were group settled by
Germans from those areas where German families settled individu~lly.
The hypothesis was considered confirmed in the first survey, was
commented on previously in this report, and was not retained for this
survey.

From the field data gathered during the first survey season, a

this was a two room house with a loft entered by an outside stair or

houses cited as the basis for the generalized house type, 41FY272,
FY280, FY297 and FY282, coupled with field data and research from the
current survey fails to support the German ethnicity of this building
style.
Although outside entered lofts were utilized by German
settlers in some areas of Texas, Jordan makes it clear that this is
one of several characteristics they copied from the native Anglo
American architectural types.
He goes so far as to say, "The house
types they copied were radically different from those in Germany, as
is evident in. . .
the outside stairway", and 11 The use of outside
stairways, an unthinkable feature in northwestern Europe, is a
valuable space saver in the warmer climate [of Texas] 11 (Jordan
1964:24). The porch/front room/rear kitchen floor plan is identified,
also by Jordan, as a floor plan of English origin with Middle Atlantic
(Anglo) origin. He describes these houses in Texas as varying from
one to one and a half stories tall and usually having a rear shed room
(Jordan, Bean and Holmes 1984:187).

Taylor (1980:171) states the houses built by German craftsmen of
Austin, Washington, Comal, Kendall, Gillispie and Fayette counties in
the late 1850s
and
early
1860s,
"are,
without
exception,
mortise-and-tenon frame houses built on the standard southern Anglo
American floor plan. 11 Further, Taylor (1980:164) makes the point that
Texas German houses are puzzling because they lack the expected German
vernacular influence in their architecture, an expectation brought on
by the continued vitality of the German language, social customs,
holiday customs, games, and other traits. In his words, 11 This lack
has caused some observers to strain at a gnat, and to speak of
'Germanic methods of construction
in
log
cabins',
'Germanic
craftsmanship' in mortise
and
tenon frame houses, and of the
'Germanic pitch' of steep roofs. 11
Thus the data from the two surveys supports the hypothesis that
the German settlers adopted the house types of their Anglo neighbors,
"The Germans copied the

farmsteads of the southern yeoman" (Jordan 1966:96), 11 No house type
was created by the Germans" (Jordan 1964:26), 11 The German settlers
learned to copy the native Anglo-American architectural styles and
floor plans 11 (Jordan, Bean and Holmes 1984:199).
Building methods both in construction techniques and materials
used, show much the same support for the hypothesis. Those building
materials which Jordan lists as differentiating German colonial
houses, half timbering, stone, brick nagging and thatched roofing
(Jordan 1966:166; 1964:24; Wilhelm 1982:16) are notably absent. The
single exception is an anomalous stone structure, 41FY403, the Wolff
House, which has been recommended for additional research. Similarly,
there is scant evidence for the external plastering of walls or
whitewashing. Only the Moss Cabin (41FY284), outside the permit area,
shows internal whitewash and the Wolff House, external plaster.
Similarly the heavy preference for casement windows, cited as German
introductions to Texas though also practiced by other peoples (Jordan
1964:24) is lacking. Jordan (1964:26), referring to the whole of
Texas' Germanic population places 1885 as the time when 11 descendents
of the German settlers chose to build typically American homes, devoid
of any trace of German influence 11 â¢ Thus, by the time the majority of
the homes, or cores of houses, still standing in the Cummins Creek
Prospect were built, ethnic distinctions were blurred through economic
and technological adaptations.
The houses of the study area are predominantly Anglo in floor
plan,
roof
pitch
angle,
construction
materials (with minor
exceptions),
placement with
regard
to
adjacent
farmsteads,
outbuildings, window type, outer covering, framing, porch type and
dimensions. The composite house type tentatively proposed in the
first report proves to be an amalgam of Anglo building practices which
gained some popularity in the last decades of the nineteenth century,
but which cannot be traced to any Germanic antecedents. Considering
the piecemeal, predominantly post Civil War, post railroad, settlement
of Cummins Creek where Texas-adapted Anglo models were abundant, this
is to be expected and Hypothesis II is confirmed as stated.

76

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Hypothesis 3.
The German settlers accepted the general farming
practices and crop patterns of the Anglo farmers, depending heavily on
cotton and corn as staple crops.
The data of the U.S. Census, Agricultural Schedules for Fayette
County for 1860 and 1870 shows that Aschen 1 s Store (Waldeck) farmers,
regardless of national origin, were growing corn and cotton as their
major crops (1870:9-13). They produced 22,390 bushels of corn and 435
bales (450 lbs ea) of cotton. The next most favored farm products
were butter, 1,901 pounds; sweet potatoes, 570 bushels; and Irish
potatoes, 122 bushels.
Only one of 106 farmers harvested more
potatoes than corn, 18 bushels of sweet and Irish potatoes combined
and he grew no corn.
His property was virtually all woods and
pasture, none of it listed as improved, and lay adjacent to that of
his father who produced 600 bushels of corn and no potatoes of either
type (Agricultural Census 1870:9, entries for John F. and Frederick
Odk in).
Data from the 1880 Fayette
County Agricultural
Schedule
(U.S. Census 1880, Texas) shows the 18 farmers in the vicinity of
Nechanitz, all but one with a German surname, produced 3,495 bushels
of corn and 122 bales of cotton. Total production of potatoes, grown
only by five farmers, was 51 bushels. CotÂ·n ar.d cotton 'i!ere the staple
crops of the area and as such represent a major change from those
grown in Europe, an adaptation to local circumstances.
HISTORIC SITES AND STRUCTURES
Introduction
Twenty eight historic sites (Table 8) were documented during the
current survey.
One additional site, consisting only of a soil
deposit, was pointed out by an informant, Mrs. Esther Matejowsky of
Nechanitz. Sites apparently older than 50 years were recorded. Where
a structure's age was in doubt, it was recorded.
Recording was not
regarded as indicative of perceived significance, but to safeguard
data that might prove useful to future research. A modest number of
potentially recordable sites were located on property not under the
sponsor's control, and access to them was denied. Most of these are
located near Waldeck.
Seven individual sites within the 12 year permit area merit
further consideration owing to their historic or architectural import.
These are described below. The remainder of the historic sites are
described in the appendix.

Cemeteries are afforded special protection status under Texas

HISTORIC RESOURCES

the current survey area.
41FY389 - Waldeck Cemetery
This large cemetery contained nearly 300 graves when it was
recorded in 1983, and is still in use. Although there may be earlier,
unmarked graves, the earliest dated memorial is 1871.
This date
corresponds well with the purchase, in 1867, of Robert Zapp's
mercantile business by Wenzel Matejowsky and Reinhardt Aschen, and
Matejowsky's donation of the land for a cemetery.
The cemetery shows a thorough blend of southern folk, German and
pagan characteristics.
There is an impression of orderliness and
neatness typical of Teutonic attention to such details.
Although an
overwhelming number of the burials bear Germanic surnames, this is not
a typical German cemetery. There are family burial plots in the
southern folk tradition. This is in contrast with the German practice
of burying only husband and wife together with burial succession in a
given ro~ ordered by the sequence of deaths (Jordan 1982:96). Husband
and wife burials are present with the husband to the left of his wife
in the German tradition, and to the right in the southern folk
tradition. German style individual grave curbings are present but so
are graves covered with cement and family plots with curbs in the
southern folk style. The pagan use of shells to decorate graves is
present, a practice adopted by both Anglos and Germans (Jordan
1982:100). There is a modern chain link fence without a lichgate.
The fence, a feature of southern folk traditions, may be a precaution
against damage by livestock. There is no distinct separate section
for the burial of children, a German tradition, but there are
instances of child burials grouped together.
The character of the grave markers is
affected
by
the
availability of mass produced items in the area after 1871. In shape,
materials, and style, most conform to what was popular at the time.
Block, tablet, obelisk, cross vaulted obelisk, scroll, raised top
inscription, pulpit, lodge linked and multiple burial/single block
types are all present in marble, granite and cement. German language
inscriptions are interspersed with those in English, and there is a
liberal use of symbols of both religious and secular origins.
This site, just within the bounds of the study area, is not
included in the current 12 year mining permit area, and can easily be
avoided. The wealth of genealogical information available from this
site makes it an appropriate resource in the study of several other
sites in the area. This cemetery would be part of any National
Register district created around the community of Waldeck. More
intensive study of this hamlet will be carried out as part of the
ongoing cultural resource program in the Cummins Creek area.

Standing Structures
41FY387 - The Krause House
The current floor plan of this structure is a central hall I
cottage with right rear ell (Fig. 10). It is unclear whether this is
the original design. The rear ell, an addition built with round wire
nails and undercut lumber, has a rear facing gabled roof at right
angles to the main roof line. There are six windows, unbalanced in
their placement, and five doors opening to the outside, supporting the
possibility that the right single pen, with its external loft
stairway, constituted the original house.
The property on which this house stands was owned by the Aschen
family before it was sold to Edward Albers in 1906. It is not known
who built it, or when. However, the balloon frame construction, the
use of machine headed square nails, round wire nails, mass produced
hinges, undercut lumber and tongue and groove siding all point to a
late nineteenth century origin. The structure has been used for hay
storage for a number of years and is currently in poor condition.
It is recommended that the structure be further investigated to
ascertain as precise a b11ilding date as possible, to determine the
original owner and/or builder, and to record its characteristics for
the use of future researchers.
41FY388 - The Bernshausen-Zieger House
This is a one and a half story, end gabled cottage with four
rooms.
It has a full width covered porch which balances the two rear
first floor rooms and allows the use of equal pitch angles in the
front and rear roofs. Both front rooms have entrances from the porch
and a stairway to the loft runs from the left side of the porch.
One
rear room has a door to the outside. The windows are six over six
paned sash hung types showing mass produced hardware.
There is no
chimney, but a brick stove flue passes from the first floor through
the loft and exits at the roof crest centered on the long axis of the
house.
The front roof slope contains symmetrically placed dormer
windows, whose horizontal, lapped siding contrasts with the board and
batten siding of the rest of the house. These windows, according to
the present owner, Perry Bernhauser, once formed dormer alcoves for
the beds of the children. The siding difference may indicate these
windows were an addition to the original structure.
By local tradition, this house is known as the "old Zieger
house 11 â¢ Robert Zieger bought the Brazeale League property on which it
stands in 1907 and it was sold to Bernshausen in 1957.
No current
evidence contradicts the tradition that the house was built by Zieger.
Although it has been used for storage for more than a decade, the
structure is in very good condition.

It is recommended that the house be further investigated to
determine whether it can be attributed to its reputed builder in the
time frame alleged, whether its dormer windows were part of the
original design, and to record its features for future researchers.
It is not within the 12 year mining area and is not currently thought
to be associated with the early Waldeck or Nechanitz hamlets. As an
entity, the house does not currently show
characteristics
or
associations which meet existing criteria for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places, but additional investigation is necessary
to confirm or deny this assessment.
41FY396 - The Finke-Matejowsky House
Little in the external characteristics of this heavily remodeled
farmhouse
suggests
significance
sufficient to warrant further
investigation. It is an I cottage with a nearly full width rear
addition, gabled perpendicular to the main roof. The covered front
porch is centered on the middle third of the front facade.
The
fenestration is symmetrical.
The use of aluminum framed windows,
asbestos siding, composition shingles of recent manufacture and the
installation of counter balanced dual roller track doors in the garage
addition, all give the impression of recent construction.
Only the
dual wooden front doors with their ogive arches in the upper panels,
give any hint of age and these are not indicative of more than a
century when found in this geographic area. However, it is alleged by
owner Fritz Finke and informant Gus Meiners that the core of the house
was erected by Wenzel Matejowsky when he lived in the general Waldeck
area prior to his participation in the purchase of the Zapp store.
Further investigation is required to determine the validity of
this suggestions and to ascertain if the core of the house is in fact
a remnant of the pioneer era. If the house is associated with Wenzel
Matejowsky, its significance in local history is established.
The house is on private property outside the 12 year permit area
and is occupied by the owner.
It is recommended that archival
confirmation of the Matejowsky association be sought and that an
examination and recording of the house core be undertaken, provided
owner permission is granted.
Qualification for eligibility for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places as an entity,
even should the Matejowsky construction be borne out, is open to
question not only because of the extensive remodeling but also because
there is another structure more closely associated with Mr. Matejowsky
(41FY401).
However, the establishing the association would make the
house a prime candidate for inclusion in the National Register
district of Waldeck and Nechanitz.

41FY401, 41FY402 Wenzel Matejowsky House, Nechanitz Store Site
The house was built by Wenzel Matejowsky in 1867, the date
generally accepted as marking his founding of Nechanitz. The house
has been continually occupied by the Matejowsky family since it was
built.
The house is of the I style with a left rear ell (Fig.
11).
Three dormer windows, evenly spaced, light the second floor and a
single dormer appears on the left roof slope of the story and a half
ell addition. The windows are six over six types with backband portal
trim used on the front and plain surrounds at the side.
The front
fenestration is two symmetrically placed doors with windows flanking
each. A full width covered integral porch with plain square posts
fronts the I, keeping the front and rear roof pitches equal at a
medium rise. A recently constructed coursed rack chimney with a
hipped fire box has been added to the left side of the I and a
fireplace faced with petrified wood inside.
Adjacent to the house is the site of the former Nechanitz stare
awned and operated by Wenzel Matejowsky. This is now only a soil
deposit, the store was destr0yed by fire in 1971.
The business was
resumed in a new building constructed across the street (FM 2145) from
the original site. Many local informants can describe the original
store and photographs of it exist.
These sites, really one complex associated with a prominent
figure in local history, are not located within the 12 year mining
permit area. However, further investigation is recommended in view of
their
function as the hub of one of the study area's early
communities. They are considered eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places.
41FY403 - Wesley W. Wolff House
The basic structure is a single story single pen square house.
The south wall is dominated by the stone fireplace of an external
stone chimney. A second room has been added, also in stone.
The
break in the masonry between the two rooms is obvious. Balancing the
stone addition is an open, covered wood framed porch. The roof pitch
dictated by the basic stone pen continues without a break over both
the stone addition and the porch. Aligned with the northwest wall of
the addition is a small single room stone pen currently under the same
roof but separated from the basic structure by a stone hallway and
having no wall in common. Although there is no symmetrically located
stone pen opposite this room, the hewn plate beam of the basic pen
extends beyond the masonry over the area. The current net effect is
that the original single pen, its stone addition, the frame porch, the
breezeway attached stone pen, and a more recently built frame section
are all under a single ridged roof whose components appear to be of
greater age than the frame section it covers. A more recent wood

84

HISTORIC RESOURCES

frame construction ell has been attached to the northeast wall of the
frame section, truncated at the point where the small stone pen's wall
commences. This addition is roofed with the ridge parallel to that of
the basic house and has a break in the roof pitch angle on the
northwest side. A cistern is located at the joint of the ell, one
which can make good advantage of only the newer frame addition's roof
runoff. A relatively recent complex including a garage, a frame barn,
and corrals are associated with the house.
The house is located in the extreme northwest corner of the John
Vanderworth league and is therefore on land available for settlement
after Robert Zapp 1 s purchase of the league in 1856.
The earliest
currently known owner of the property after Zapp is John T. Sommers
Sr., a blacksmith who operated a smithy in partnership with Adolph
Roerchke.
In 1877, J.T. Sommers Sr. sold his half interest in the
smithy to his son, J.T. Sommers Jr. (Fayette County Clerk, Deed Book
4:289, 291).
The senior Sommers appears on the 1870 agricultural
census records for the area and further research may reveal when he
acquired this property. He is not among the original 17 purchasers of
Zapp's Vanderworth property whose purchase dates extend through 1860,
a 17 year gap (1860-1877) to be researched.
The distinctly German derived use of stone and external plaster,
the
industrial
use
of the property, and the anomalous roof
construction make this site
a prime
candidate
for
further
investigation.
It is located within the 12 year mining permit area
but will continue to be owner occupied as it will be adjacent to a
retention pond.
The structure is considered tentatively
water
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places on
its method of construction alone and may meet other evaluation
criteria. Although not a unique form of construction for the general
area, there are stone structures in nearby Warrenton and the Siegal
Settlement, it is nonetheless a relatively rare form for this area of
Texas.
It is recommended that further archival and on-site research be
accomplished
to
ascertain
the
structure's
builder, date of
construction, early usage, occupancy chain and community association.
Additional
detailed recording of construction features is also
recommended.

SUMMARY OF TWO INTENSIVE SURVEYS IN THE
CUMMINS CREEK PROSPECT
The two intensive surveys of the Cummins Creek study area were
carried out prior to an application for a permit to mine and were
intended to serve the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) as a
planning aid. Subsequent to the submission of this, the second of two
reports, for regulatory agency review, the LCRA filed a permit
application with the Texas Railroad Commission. This summary of the
findings of both intensive surveys places the recorded sites within
the context of the 12-year mining plans detailed in the permit
application. Projected land use during the life-of-mine reflected in
the application will not be finalized for at least a decade so that
site specific cultural resource protection measures
recommended
throughout the two planning documents will require reevaluation at
that time.
Three areas, ordered by degree of proposed modification, have now
been defined. The Study Area is the 25,000 acre Prospect intensively
surveyed in the 1982 and 1983 field seasons and reported
in
Nightengale and Jackson (1983) and the body of this report. The
Twelve Year Permit Area consists of 9,408 acres, largely in the Rabbs
Creek Basin or the southwestern portion of the Study Area. Within the
Permit Area, a Disturbance Area of 3,948 acres will actually be
physically modified by mining or the construction of auxiliary
facilities.
STUDY AREA
Twenty three thousand, three hundred and twenty acres of the over
25,000 acres within the study area were intensively surveyed. Access
to the remaining 2,100 was denied by landowners. Only 420 acres of
the Permit Area remain unsurveyed;
none of those properties are
leased by the LCRA nor lie within the Disturbance Zone.
PREHISTORIC RESOURCES
One hundred thirty three prehistoric sites, 56 in 1982 and 77 in
1983, were recorded within the 23,320 acres surveyed. Of those, 49
sites were recommended for further study to determine their potential
for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Seventy
one of the 133 recordings fall within the Permit Area;
24 of those
are among the 49 originally recommended for limited testing (Table 9).
Seventeen of the potential National Register nominees are within or
adjacent the disturbance area and are currently undergoing limited
testing to determine if they meet eligibility criteria.

HISTORIC SITES
In 1982, 34 historic sites including 4 cemeteries were recorded
in the initial survey. In 1983, an additional 29, one of which was a
cemetery, were added bringing the total of historic recordings in the
Study Area to 63. Some standing structures, largely centering around
the historic hamlet of Waldeck, remain unrecorded at the request of
their owners.
Fourteen historic sites were considered to hold some
potential for nomination to the National Register, seven located in
the first survey and six in the second. Since that time, two standing
structures, 41FY294 and 41FY300, were sold and moved to new locations
outside the affected area.
Twenty three historic sites are within the permit area; nine of
those fall within the disturbance area. Only three of the historic
sites with individual potential for nomination to the National
Register lie within the permit boundaries but outside the disturbance
area. A fourth house, 41FY294, has been moved from the disturbance
zone.
More detailed archival work and additional recording are
recommended at 41FY280, 41FY297 and 41FY403. These early homes are
all still privately owned and no purchase of the structures is
anticipated by the LCRA. Therefore, no mitigative action beyond that
underway in the limited testing phase is currently planned.

The coming industrialization of Fayette County will undoubtedly
indirectly affect the character of these small communities. One
method of preserving the flavor and physical characteristics of these
hamlets, recommended in this report, is the video taping of the
structures and of interviews with long time residents.
Such an
approach could be extended to include other sites within or adjacent
to the permit area. Subsequent archival research to confirm avenues
suggested by the local citizenry would be an integral part of the on
going cultural resource program in the Cummins Creek Prospect.

Prehistoric Research Design

David G. Robinson

Reprinted from Nightengale and Jackson (1983)

RESEARCH DESIGN
Based on the previous archeological work in Fayette County, a
summary of prehistoric site distribution across physiographic zones
was compiled by David G. Robinson of TAS for use as a regional
research design.
The following excerpt describes the model of
prehistoric settlement tested by both the 1982 and 1983 intensive
surveys of the Cummins Creek Prospect.
A site typology was constructed by examination of the TARL site
files, and the site types were plotted on a table according to their
distribution across the physiographic zones of Fayette County.
The
result is a table showing the major components of the prehistoric
settlement pattern of the county. A discussion of site typology and a
description
of
the
physiographic
zones
precede
the table.
Observations and a discussion of the table follow it.
In evaluating the settlement pattern scheme, two aspects of it
must be noted immediately. First, the pattern does not control for
chronology. Sites from all time periods are found on it, primarily
because the majority of sites in the county are undated, and exclusion
of these sites from the table would have left the effort with
inadequate site data for manipulation. The effect of this temporal
inclusiveness is some likely skewing of each cultural
stage's
settlement pattern from the overall pattern. It should be remembered
however, that an accurate settlement pattern of each cultural stage is
contained within the charted whole, and is not a different character
entirely. Refinement of the chronology will refine the settlement
pattern, not restructure it.
A second aspect of the settlement pattern is its spatial
representativeness.
All
areas
of
the county are adequately
represented on the table in spite of the fact that numerous sites were
found in the Columbus Bend and Cedar Creek reservoirs in the
southeastern portion of the county.
Site Typology and Physiographic Zones
The site typology used here is descriptive. The attempt was made
to avoid straying too far from the typologies used by previous field
workers who identified Fayette County's sites and contributed site
information to the site files.
The result of numerous workers
operating independently, however, is a mixture of functional and
descriptive designations for the sites in Fayette County. For the
sake of consistency, therefore, it was decided to give descriptive
designations to sites with functional appelations. These designations
were made on the basis of materials and features observed and

CUMMINS CREEK

91

excavated by field archeologists, combining survey and excavation data
where available. It was recognized also that even a descriptive
typology necessarily divides a continuum of site variation, and that a
typology adequately accounting for every site would have one site in
each type. At that point one no longer has a classification. On the
other hand, too inclusive a typology would hide meaningful patterns of
sites.
The typology derived here tries to balance these opposing
forces and provide a meaningful classification which places similar
sites together and reveals patterns of site distribution over the
landscape. The taxa of site classification are quantity of cultural
material,
type of cultural material, site structures (cultural
features) and special locational features (gravel outcrops).
It is
apparent that this typology is peculiar to Fayette County and it is
directed toward current research problems in the area's prehistory.
The classes of typology, described in detail below, are:
1.

dense scatters,

2.

dense scatters without featÂ·ures,

3.

dense scatters on gravel outcrops,

4.

light scatters with features,

5.

light scatters without features,

6.

1i ght scatters on gravel outcrops,

7.

lithic scatters.

Locations on gravel outcrops are included in the typology because
gravel outcrops are significant resource areas in the county and
because their locations do not conform to the physiographic divisions
of the landscape. These facts demonstrate the very particular nature
of the site typology; this is by intent, and the typology is not
intended to be generally applicable or encompassing of sites and
territories outside the southeastern area of the Central Texas
archeological region.
1. Dense Scatters With Features. This type and all the dense
scatter types are what have been termed habitation or occupation sites
by most surveying archeologists. A dense scatter as defined here
implies both quantity and variety of cultural materials. In addition
to at least 100 items exposed on the surface or in cutbanks, dense
scatters in Fayette County have four or more of the following types of
items: burned rock, stone flaking debris, mussel shell, charcoal,
burned and unburned bone, flaked stone tools and pottery. Features
include hearths, burned rock middens, shell middens and burials.
Dense scatters with features may have one, a few, or all these
cultural features.

92

APPENDIX I

2. Dense scatters Without Features. This type consists of dense
material scatters without observable or likely features.
3. Dense Scatters On Gravel Outcrops. Sites of this type are
those which combine dense and varied scatters with locations on
natural gravel outcrops, regardless of
physiographic
location.
Quarrying activity is one likely function of these sites.
4.
Light Scatters With Features.
Light scatters are the
converse of dense scatters, being scatters with little exposed
material (fewer than 100 items), and that limited in variety to one to
three types of material.
In Fayette County the two most common
material types on sites are burned rock and stone flaking debris.
Other combinations occur, but examination of site forms showed that
light scatters had no more than three different types of items.
The
potential conflicting cases of little material but much variety, or
much material but little variety did not occur, it appearing to be
true that quantity and variety vary directly with each other. Light
scatters may reveal features but usually just one feature or one type
of feature, never several or all types of features. The light scatter
types were usually functionally termed limited activity sites by
previous surveying archeologists.
5. Light Scatters Without Features.
These sites consist
light scatters of cultural material without accompanying features.

of

6. Light Scatters On Gravel Outcrops. These sites consist of
light scatters located on gravel outcrops, where quarrying was likely
the primary function of the site.
7. Lithic Scatters. These sites are composed of scatters of
stone flaking debris, stone cores and unfinished or broken stone
tools. They are common but distinctive due to their monotonous
emphasis on lithic debitage and their lack of any other kind of
material. If another type of material was observed on the site, the
site became, by definition, one or another of the light or dense
scatter site types.

The Colorado River floodplain

2.

The first terrace of the Colorado

3.

The first fluviatile terrace and lower slopes above streams

4.

The upper slopes of stream drainages

5.

The uplands on stream divides.

These zones can be thought of as dividing the landscape of Fayette
County.
Certain areas of overlap occur, primarily where streams cut
the first terrace and floodplain of the Colorado, and designation of
site physiographic zones in these areas admits judgmental factors.
Generally, it was decided that a site lay on a stream terrace if it
lay immediately adjacent to a creek flowing across the first terrace
or floodplain. Farther away from a creek, a site would be designated
as a first terrace or flooplain site. In short, creeks flowing across
the first terrace and floodplain of the Colorado are considered to
lack upper drainage slopes and stream divides. For more background on
physiographic zones in Fayette County and the region, see Kenmotsu and
Freeman (1980), Looney (1977), and Thornbury (1965).
Results
Results of the file search and tabulation of site types in each
physiographic zone are seen in Table I-1. One hundred sixty-four
sites are included, all are prehistoric sites.
Twenty-five historic
sites in the TARL files were excluded, as were eight prehistoric sites
for which either locational or descriptive data were so inadequately
recorded that a determination of locale or site type was impossible.
Table I-1 is followed by observations of its
patterns,
some
interpretations, and a method for the testing and further application
of the settlement pattern indicated by the table,
OBSERVATIONS

the sites included in the study, far more than any other physiographic
zone. Additionally, at least one site of every type is found in this
zone.
Light scatters without features numbered 38 sites on creek
terraces, and 39 lithic scatters are found on them.

significant, and this is partially explained by Observation two.
2. Light scatters without features and lithic scatters are the
most numerous site types in the county, with 39 and 31.1% of the
studied sites, respectively. Light scatters without features occur in
a 11 physi ographi c zones, 1i thi c scatters in a 11 zones save the

3. The most complex sites, dense scatter with features, dense
scatters on gravel outcrops, and light scatters with features, occur
on the Colorado floodplain, the first terrace of the river and on
creek terraces, but not on the higher elevations - upper slopes and
stream divides. As an allied general observation, the more complex
sites cluster in the zones of lower relative position while simpler
sites are found in higher physiographic position. With reference to
the table, higher site frequencies are found progressively from left
to right and top to bottom, beginning with frequencies of more complex
sites in lowland locales to greater number of simpler sites in upland
locales, centered around stream environments.
The settlement pattern presented here hints at predominant creek
terrace locational and economic strategies employed by the prehistoric
cultures of the area. Sites on creek terraces may have been camps
that were offshoots from larger base villages at other points along
the creeks, on the floodplain of the Colorado River or first river
terrace of the Colorado.
From the creek terraces, the prehistoric
people probably launched their foraging and resource procurement
campaigns, and it is to these that they returned with their produce.
The preliminary settlement pattern scheme can be tested by
further survey and can contribute to test excavation and mitigation
programs to generate data and test propositions in further research in
the country.
The validity of the settlement model proposed by Robinson can be
only partially tested in a physiographically restricted area such as
the Cummins Creek Prospect.
The categories of river terrace and
floodplain are superfluous;
only the possibility of confirming the
association of site types defined as light scatters and lithic
scatters with creek terraces and lower slopes could be explored. Due
to the specific limitations on environmental setting within the
Prospect, Robinson's typology was refined for the final distributional
analysis to differentiate between creek terraces and lower slopes
(Table I-2).
Some ambiguity between the categories upper slopes and stream
divides was noted during these surveys. Sites were found on minor
upland drainways which could be termed "creek terrace", "upper
slopes", or "stream divide" depending on the referrant water source.
The field supervisors opted for the most appropriate classification.

These somewhat self-evident assumptions were those considered
testable at the level of information obtainable from intensive survey
of the Prospect.
More complex propositions

the
acquisition of survey data from more diversified environments than is
the case in the Prospect and upon testing and excavation programs yet
to be conducted.

Additional Site Descriptions
Sites recorded in this survey but not specifically selected for
additional testing or excavation are described below in narrative
form. Additional characteristics are listed in abbreviated form in
Tables I and 8. Based on survey data, none of the prehistoric sites
meet the basic criteria for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places, either because of sparsity and shallowness of
cultural deposits or severe post depositional disturbances.
Similarly, the historic sites listed here are judged to be
individually ineligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places, but may qualify as contributing members to any
district created around the study area. In the case of structures,
treir lack of qualification is usually due to remodeling that has
destroyed the historic integrity or to very poor current condition.
PREHISTORIC SITES
41FY311
This open campsite is on the first terrace along the west bank of
Cummins Creek, approximately 500 meters south of SCS dam No. 4 and 30
meters southwest of the creek itself. It lies in a clearing between
creekside vegetation and a wooded area, consisting of oak, cedar,
grasses and shrubs. Soils are of the Bunyan series of fine sandy
loams (SCS 1980). Artifacts noted included chert flakes and chips and
firecracked rock but no temporally diagnostic artifacts and occupation
period could not be assessed. Shovel probes revealed minimal cultural
material to a depth of one meter or more. The distribution of surface
and subsurface material indicated site size at approximately 64 by 18
meters. The site has been disturbed by erosion and clearing of
vegetation;
rodent activity was also observed. 41FY310 is located
approximately 300 meters north of the site.
41FY312
Approximately 250 meters south of 41FY311, this open campsite is
on the southeast terrace about 150 meters from Cummins Creek. What
appears to be an old channel lies at the base of the terrace slope and
the majority of the site is on the mid- and crest slope. Soils are

Other artifacts observed included a biface basal fragment, a
Friday biface, two bifacial cores and a scatter of secondary and
tertiary flakes and burned rock.
Based on surface and subsurface
testing, site size is estimated at 140 by 75 meters with a depth of 80
centimeters. The site has been heavily disturbed by clearing and road
construction.

41FY313
This site, lying 100 meters west of Cummins Creek, is on the
eastern edge of a ridge line tht~ farms part of the divide between
Cummins and Turkey creeks. The knoll overlooks the confluence of
these creeks about one kilometer to the south. The site soils are
Tremona loamy fine sands (SCS 1979).
Vegetation consists of short
field
grasses,
scattered isolated oaks and twist leaf yucca.
Artifacts observed include a minimal scatter of cores, flakes, chips
and some burned rock. No diagnostic artifacts were observed and the
site's occupation period cannot be determined. Shovel probes revealed
scanty cultural materials to a depth of 65 centimeters; site size is
estimated at 55 by 45 meters.
41FY315
This site, lying about 10 meters from Cummins Creek on the east
terrace and extending inland, is approximately 100 meters southeast of
41FY314. Site soils are of the Bunyan fine sandy loam series (SCS
1980) and are frequently flooded. The southeastern portion of the
site lies in the riparian forest, extending northwards into improved
pasture dotted with post oak.
Since no diagnostic artifacts were
identified, this light lithic scatter cannot be assigned an occupation
period.
Based on the distribution of flakes and burned rock observed
on the surface and in three shovel probes, site size was estimated at
10 by 30 meters, with a maximum depth of 40 centimeters. The
integrity of the cultural deposits has been affected by erosion, and
the surface of the site is traversed by a ranch road.

APPENDIX II

41FY317
41FY317 is set atop the southern end of a south trending
interfluve between Cummins and Violets creeks, about 200 meters
northwest of Violets Creek. The confluence of the creeks is 250
meters to the southeast.
The site lies in an improved pasture of
short grasses with scattered post oak.
Soils are Tremona very
gravelly loamy fine sands (SCS 1979). Cultural material consisted of
a light scatter of chert flakes and burned rock;
one biface basal
fragment was found. None of the observed artifacts were diagnostic,
so the site's occupation period remains unknown. The surface scatter
covered an area approximately 90 by 40 meters and a limited amount of
subsurface debris reached a depth of about 40 centimeters. Impacts to
the site included erosion and recent clearing of vegetation in the
floodplain.
41FY318
This site is on the southeast crest and slope of a southeast
trending slope projection at the end of an interfluve formed by Mile
Branch and Cummins Creek. The crest is partially forested with the
midslope cleared for pasturage. Soils at the site are Tremona series
gravelly lc..ir.1y fine sands (SCS 1979). Dominant vegetation is short
grasses with some live oak. The site was identified on the basis of
limited cultural material piled along the break between forest and
pasture, apparently redeposited as a result of clearing. Artifacts
observed included five bifacial cores, one thinned biface distal
fragment and a small amount of flakes and burned rock. Soils are
shallow - shovel probes reached a maximum depth of 25 centimeters.

41FY320
This scatter of cores and core fragments is on the western crest
of a south trending divide overlooking Violets Creek and site 41FY321.
Material culture consisted of cores and core fragments, with one
biface fragment found downslope from the main concentration atop the
rise. The lack of flakes suggests the site was primarily used as a
procurement area.
No artifacts diagnostic of occupation period were
observed. Site soils are of the Tremona series gravelly loamy fine
sand (SCS 1979). Vegetation consists of scattered post oak, live oak,
cedar, yaupon holly and short grasses.
Surface scatter extended
across an area of 110 by 70 meters; no subsurface probes were taken
because of impenetrable surface soil mixed with gravels. The site has
been disturbed by erosion and land clearing and an area 75 meters to
the east has been quarried for gravel in the recent past.

41FY322
This site, in the Rabbs Creek drainage basin, is in a cleared
field edged by a southeast meander in a northwest-flowing tributary to
Jones Creek. The confluence is 250 meters to the northwest.
Soils
are Falba variant loamy fine sands (SCS 1981). The site is covered
with short grasses, weeds and isolated cedars with a cedar and oak
forest bordering the creek. A few secondary flakes, three bifacial
cores and one piece of burned rock constituted observed cultural
material. Shovel probes revealed a shallow deposit, no more than five
centimeters in depth, with the surface scatter covering an area of
approximately 40 by 30 meters. No cultural features or diagnostic
artifacts were found. The site soils are badly deflated and the area
has been additionally disturbed by clearing.
41FY323
This site is on the north bank of an unnamed tributary flowing
into Owl Creek. The site follows the west bank at a point where the
creek meanders north. The Falba variant loamy fine sands (SCS 1981)
are heavily eroded due to meander cutting and sheetwash. The site
lies in a post oak and cedar forest with open areas of short grasses.
M:tarial culture consisted of a light scatter of flakes - a few of
which were petrified wood, a small amount of burned rock and a single
chert core.
Since there were no diagnostic artifacts, the site's
occupation period could not be assessed. The distribution of surface
and subsurface debris extended over an area approximately 50 by 50
meters, reaching a depth of about 20 centimeters.
41FY324
41FY324 lies on the outside of a meander on a unnamed tributary
to an
unnamed tributary of Owl Creek.
Owl Creek itself is
approximately 500 meters west of the site, Jones Creek about 800

41FY331
Located on the left bank of the southeastern headwater branch of
Blair Creek, this site was found eroding from a gentle slope and the
cutbank of the drainage, which takes a westward meander just to the
north.
The site lies partially in forest of cedar, yaupon holly and

41FY332
41FY332 is 500 meters north of the confluence of the two
headwater branches of Blair Creek, on the north side of a sharp
meander in the southeastern tributary. 41FY330 and 41FY331 are along
the same drainage. Falba fine sandy loams (SCS 1981) support post oak
and cedar woodlands with clearings of short field grasses. Flakes and
burned rock were found on the surface of this open campsite over an
area 55 by 25 meters and to a depth of 80 centimeters.

On the
northeastern margins of the site the trees give way to short field
grasses. Soils in the area are Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978).
Two concentrations of burned rock about ten meters apart were found
eroding from the crest of the slope down to the creek. A small amount
of flakes and burned rock were noted in association with these
hearths. No diagnostic artifacts were found. Based on surface and
subsurface deposits, site size was estimated at 50 by 30 meters, site
depth at 20 centimeters. It appears that most of the site has eroded
away.
41FY334
Resting on a slight knoll bordering on a tributary to Owl Creek,
this very light lithic scatter was exposed in gopher backdirt piles.
The site lies in an area of short field grasses and scattered post
oak.
Soils are Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978). Four tertiary
chert flakes were found on the surface. A few flakes were found to a
depth of 60 centimeters;
burned rock was also present below the
surface. No materials observed were diagnostic of occupation period.
Distribution of surface and subsurface debris indicated site size to

be about 20 by 20 meters. The site appears to have been disturbed by
erosion, plowing and clearing, but is estimated to be largely intact.
41FY335
This site was found eroding from gullies in the right bank of Owl
Creek.
A small portion appeared intact to the east of the gullied
area. Creekside vegetation consisted of cedar, post oak, live oak and
yaupon holly.
Soils are Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978).
Numerous chert and petrified wood flakes, a biface medial fragment and
a unifacially worked piece of petrified wood were noted. Based on
surface and subsurface deposits, site size was estimated at 15 by 20
meters; site depth at 40 centimeters.
41FY336
This site is situated on the deeply incised southeast bank of Owl
Creek, on the outside of a 90 degree west trending meander. A marshy
area, possibly a spring, is immediately to the south.
The site is
covered with short field grasses, isolated post oaks and a single
willow tree. Area soils are Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978).
One shovel probe exposed a hearth lying on sterile clay at nine
centimeters below the surface. Thirty meters to the north, a scatter
of petrified wood flakes and a petrified wood core were observed, but
no artifacts were noted in association with the hearth. No diagnostic
artifacts were found. Surface scatter covered an area 95 by 30 meters
in size. Soils were badly deflated and site depth appeared to be no
greater than 10 centimeters. Affected by heavy erosion and deflation,
the site is probably largely destroyed.
41FY337
Located on the southeast side of an unnamed tributary to Owl
Creek, this light lithic scatter was exposed in a deep gully cut into
the bank. Material culture consisted of four flakes and a small
amount of burned rock; no artifacts diagnostic of occupation period
were found. Soils are Falba variant loamy fine sands (SCS 1981).
Vegetation consisted of blackjack Â·oak, post oak, cedar and yaupon
riparian forest with clearings of short grasses. Shovel probes turned
up no buried deposits; it appears that heavy sheetwash and gullying
have removed all but the minimal remains observed.
Site size was
estimated at 20 by 20 meters.

104

APPENDIX II

41FY338
This lithic scatter was found eroding in gullies on either side
of an unnamed tributary to Owl Creek. The site area is forested with
post oak, cedar and yaupon holly with clearings of short grasses. The
land slopes gently down to the creek and has been affected by
sheetwash and gully erosion.
Surface scatter covered an area of
approximately 30 by 50 meters. Artifacts collected from the surface
included an unidentified dart point base and a lanceolate point base
with edge grinding, suggesting that the site was used during the Late
Paleoindian and possibly Archaic periods (before 8500 to 2250 BP).
A
petrified wood core fragment, several flakes and a scatter of burned
rock were also observed. Shovel probes revealed the Falba variant
loamy fine sands (SCS 1981) to be badly deflated; sterile clay was
reached at a depth of about 11 centimeters. A single burned chip was
unearthed in the probes.
The site appears to have been largely
destroyed by erosion.

appeared to be small and shallow, covering an area approximately 38 by
12 meters paralleling the gully bank and reaching a depth of about 40
centimeters. The gully has no doubt destroyed portions of the site.
41FY342
This light lithic scatter was found in a level area forested with
post oak, cedar, yaupon holly and short grasses approximately 200
meters south of Owl Creek.
The limited cultural material present
included chert and petrified wood flakes, a single petrified wood core
and scattered burned rocks extending over an area of 50 by 25 meters.
Natural gravels were abundant and, together with the paucity of
artifacts, suggest that this may have been a lithic procurement site.
No
artifacts diagnostic of occupation period were found.
The
Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978) bearing the cultural deposits
were deflated;
sterile clay was reached at less than 10 centimeters
below ground surface.
Sheetwash erosion and minor rilling were
observed.
41FY343
This site lies on a low, wooded ridge separating Owl Creek 100
meters to the northwest from an unnamed tributary to the south~ast.
The woods covering the site consist primarily of post oak, cedar and
yaupon holly.
Soils are Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978). The
site appears to be small and shallow;
burned rock, secondary and
tertiary flakes were scattered over a 15 by 25 meter area. Several
flakes were turned up in shovel probes to a depth of about 10
centimeters.
No formal tools or diagnostic artifacts were observed.
The site has been affected by sheetwash erosion.
41FY344
Located on a slightly sloping terrace approximately 175 meters
east of Owl Creek, this lithic scatter lies in a wooded area of post
oak, cedar and yaupon with a few annual forbes, grasses and blackjack
oak.
Soils are Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978). The thinly
distributed cultural material consisted of a few chert flakes, some
flakes of a high quality petrified wood, a petrified wood core
fragment, a partially reduced palmwood biface and the basal fragment
of a dart point, possibly a type indicative of a Middle Archaic
occupation (4600-2250 BP). The size of the scatter was estimated at
45 meters from northeast to southwest by 25 meters from northwest to
southeast. The deflated soils contained cultural deposits to a depth
of 10 centimeters or less.
Impacts to the site include sheetwash
erosion, minor rilling and the construction of an unimproved road
immediately to the north of the site 1 s apparent boundary.

41FY346
41FY346 was.found exposed in a cutbank on the south side of Owl
Creek.
Atop the bank the surface slopes back from the creek in a
southerly direction. Gullies have begun to incise this area, exposing
additional deposits.
The site area is wooded with cedar, post oak,
blackjack oak, yaupon and short grasses.
Soils are Burlewash fine
sandy loams (SCS 1978). Cultural material, consisting of chert and
petrified wood flakes, burned rock, a petrified wood core and a chert
biface, covered an area approximately 72 meters along the creek bank
by 42 meters southward from the creek, with some of the material
observed in the cutbank.
No artifacts diagnostic of an occupation
period were noted. Very light subsurface deposits reached a depth of
80 centimeters.
The site has been largely disturbed by the bank
sloughing, sheetwash erosion and gullying.
41FY347
This site is just below the crest of the stream divide between
Owl and Blair creeks, on gently sloping terrain overlooking Owl Creek.
It lies in a cultivated pasture with short grasses, annual forbes and
widely scattered post oak and cedar. Soils are Falba fine sandy loams
(SCS 1981). The very light scatter of chert flakes and burned rock
covered an area approximately 25 by 25 meters in size. Shovel probes
revealed additional remains in the 11 centimeters of plow zone above
sterile clay.
A single chert core was found on the surface; no
diagnostic artifacts were observed.
Erosion and
plowing
have
disturbed the site.
41FY348
This light lithic scatter is above the confluence of two branches
of a minor tributary to Blair Creek, in a clearing of short grasses
and annual forbes surrounded by post oak and cedar woodlands.
The
tributary/creek confluence is 200 meters downstream near the head of
Blair Creek. The Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978) at the site
are badly deflated and gullied. Material culture consisted of several
flakes and three cores of chert and petrified wood.
Surface scatter
extended over an area estimated at 25 by 20 meters. No artifacts
diagnostic of occupation period and no cultural features were noted.
The site was so heavily graveled at the surface that shovel probes

41FY349
Located on the south bank of a minor tributary to Blair Creek
approximately 200 meters upstream from the confluence, this light
lithic scatter was found exposed amid gravels which have eroded from

CUMMINS CREEK

107

the tributary banks.
Cultural material was very limited, two cores
and a small number of flakes and burned rocks were observed. The site
is in a wooded area of post oak and cedar with patches of short
grasses and annual forbes. Soils are Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS
1978).
The size of the surface scatter was estimated at 25 by 30
meters;
shovel probes to 15 centimeters showed no
subsurface
deposits.
As with 41FY348, the minimal deposits amid gravels suggest
use as a lithic procurement area. This site has been disturbed by
gully erosion, probably accelerated by stock tank construction.
41FY350
This site is on the left cutbank of the main southeast branch of
the headwaters to Blair Creek; another small drainage runs into this
branch immediately south of the site, which rests at the point of
confluence. Vegetation is dominated by cedar, post oak, yaupon holly,
low grasses and weeds. Soils are Falba fine sandy loams (SCS 1981).
The site was defined on the basis of a moderate concentration of
flakes and a small amount of burned rock observed in erosional gullies
across the surface, covering an area estimated at 20 by 20 meters.
Two flakes were found in shovel probes at a depth of 20 centimeters
below the surface.
No cultural features or artifacts diagnostic of
occupation period were observed. Burned rock ~uggests the site was
utilized as a campsite but not reused to any great extent.
41FY358
This very light lithic scatter was found on the southeastern side
of Jones Creek, approximately 40 meters south of the creek's cutbank.
The confluence of Jones and Owl creeks lies 100 meters to the
northwest.
Vegetation
in
the area consisted of cedar, oak,
greenbriar, yaupon holly, short grasses and weeds.
Soils
are
Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978). Material culture included a
small quantity of chert and petrified wood tertiary flakes and burned
rock.
Most materials were found on the surface covering an area of
approximately 20 by 40 meters. Limited subsurface deposits reached a
depth of 40 centimeters in shovel probes. No diagnostic artifacts or
cultural features were found.
The site has been disturbed by
sheetwash erosion and rilling.
41FY359
This very light lithic scatter, exposed in a south flowing gully
draining into Owl Creek, occupies a stepped slope leading down to the
creek. The confluence of Owl Creek with a large primary tributary
lies approximately 150 meters west of the site. Vegetation consists
of cedar, post oak, blackjack oak, yaupon holly and greenbriar
woodland;
the gully lies at the edge of a small clearing covered in
bluestem and annual forbes. Cultural material observed included a
very few petrified wood and chert flakes, a light scatter of burned
rock, one piece of historic milkglass and one Scallorn eddy arrow

open campsite (1250
650 BP).
Artifactual material covered an
estimated area of 55 by 25 meters, reaching a depth of 20 centimeters
in shovel probes. The sparse remains seem to indicate a very brief
occupation, although heavy erosion and deflation of the Burlewash fine
sandy loams (SCS 1978) may have destroyed a large percentage of the
deposits.

A complete Darl hoxie dart point was found on the
surface, which dated site occupation to the San Geronimo phase of the
Early Archaic (7000 - 6000 BP). A few flakes and burned rock chips
were also found covering an area of approximately 14 by 24 meters.
Four flakes were turned up in shovel probes, with a maximum depth of

This site was found in a clearing on the north side of the divide
between Jones Creek to the south and Owl Creek approximately 80 meters
to the north. Vegetation consisted of cedar, post oak and blackjack
oak, with an understory of yaupon holly, and short grasses and forbes
in the clearing. Soils are Tremona very gravelly loamy fine sands
(SCS 1979). A moderate scatter of chert and petrified wood flakes and
burned rock chips covered an area 12 by 38 meters in size. Subsurface
deposits remained moderate and varied in depth from approximately 70
centimeters at the eastern end of the site to 40 centimeters at the
western end.
A single chert core and a biface tip of petrified wood
were also observed. No artifacts found were diagnostic of occupation
period.
This open campsite has been disturbed by sheetwash erosion,
but subsurface deposits may still be intact.
41FY365
This very light scatter of cores and primary flakes is situated
on the edge of the divide between Flat and Cedar creeks. Local
gravels are present over much of the divide.
So'.1s are Falba fine
sandy loams (SCS 1981). The site is in an area of cleared pasture;
vegetation is dominated by annual grasses and forbes with clumps of
post oak and yaupon holly.
Two chert cores and two chert primary
flakes were the only artifacts found, precluding assessment of
occupation period but suggesting that the site was used for lithic
procurement. Several possible tested cobbles were noted on the
surface about 50 meters west of the site. Site area was estimated to
be 25 by 20 meters. Soils were deflated and site depth was no more
than five centimeters.
41FY366
This site is situated at the edge of a south terrace of Cummins
Creek, against the creek valley wall. It extends out onto the terrace
in the direction of the creek approximately 200 meters away. The site
area is heavily wooded in post oak, yaupon holly and a few cedar with
small clearings of grasses and annual forbes. Soils are Tremona loamy
fine sands (SCS 1979) with heavy gravels capping the upper slopes of
the terrace. Material culture was light, consisting of a minimal
amount of burned rock and several chert flakes, most of which were
found below the surface. No artifacts diagnostic of occupation period
were found. Deposits were concentrated in an area approximately 30 by
30 meters in size, reaching a depth of 70 centimeters in shovel
probes. This site has been somewhat disturbed by erosion.

This small, light accumulation of lithic debris and burned rock
is in an open field on the first, frequently flooded terrace of
Cummins Creek. The field is covered with mid-grasses and occasional
open, sandy areas. Soils are the Tremona loamy fine sands (SCS 1979).
The land slopes gently in a northeasterly direction to the creek,
approximately 190 meters distant. Sparsely distributed burned rock,
two secondary flakes and several tertiary flakes were observed on the
surface and in probes to a depth of 82 centimeters. The deposits
covered an area of approximately 55 by 25 meters.
No diagnostic
artifacts were found. An incision just north of the site appears to
be an old creek channel, or possibly a cut made by a bulldozer. Other
impacts to the site are minimal.
41FY368
This site, lying on a bank approximately 100 meters southwest of
Cedar Creek, is in a cleared corridor amidst dense woodlands of yaupon
holly and cedar. Mid-grasses cover the cleared area.
The Falba
variant loamy fine sands (SCS 1981) are frequently flooded and badly
deflated; the area has been additionally disturbed by clearing and
construction of a pipeline running appro~:~ately 100 meters to the
south. Burned rock was present on the site surface and in shovel
probes to a depth of 20 centimeters or less. Primary, secondary and
tertiary flakes and core fragments were also observed on the surface.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were found.
The site is small, covering an area estimated at 25 by 55 meters.
41FY370
This rather small, shallow site is on the crest of a low ridge
above the southwest bank of Owl Creek. A seep spring is located on
the southeast edge of the site, across the creek from the main
concentration of artifacts.
The site lies in a cleared area of
mid-grasses and annual forbes, surrounded by oak and loblolly pine
woodlands.
Soils are Tremona very gravelly loamy fine sands (SCS
1979). An old road, no longer in use, crosses the site from north to
south.
A hearth consisting of roughly a dozen large burned rocks was
observed eroding from this road. Three cores were found in close
proximity to the hearth.
Several primary, secondary and tertiary
chert flakes were also noted in the hearth's vicinity and scattered
across the site.
Several burned rock and core fragments were found
associated with the seep spring. A single biface of opalized wood was
uncovered in shovel probe A-1.
None of the artifacts found were
diagnostic of occupation period. Site size was estimated at 60 by 20
meters,
with
deposits
reaching
a depth of approximately 15
centimeters. Impacts to the site include erosion, primarily in the
area of the seep spring, and the road.

CUMMINS CREEK

lll

41FY372
This site is in a clearing on a thickly wooded interfluve between
two unnamed east flowing tributaries of Cummins Creek, which lies
approximately 500 meters from the site.
The larger of the two
intermittent tributaries is about 100 meters downslope from the site.
The woodlands around the site consist of cedar, post oak and scattered
yaupon; short grasses cover the clearing. Soils are Falba fine sandy
loams (SCS 1981).
Flakes and burned rock were noted in rodent
backdirt and scattered on the surface across an area 30 by 30 meters
in size. Shovel probes showed concentrations of flakes and burned
rock in stream gravels that started at the surface and continued to,
and below, 45 centimeters. Attempted probes about 10 meters south of
the site showed heavy deflation, with clays lying on the surface.
This deflation continued to the edge of the interfluve.
The site
appeared to be fairly disturbed by erosion and bioturbation.
41FY373
This very limited, short term campsite is situated on a small
terrace along an intermittent tributary which runs into Owl Creek
roughly 160 meters to the southeast. Vegetation consists of loblolly
pine, cedar, post oak, yaupon holly, short weeds and grasses. Soils
are Tremona very gravelly loamy fine sands (SCS 1979). The site was
identified on the basis of a hearth exposed along the drainage bank.
a
Material observed in association with the hearth was limited;
single core and a few flakes. Site size was estimated at 10 by 10
meters; deposits reached a depth of 20 centimeters in shovel probes.
This limited depth appears to be the result of heavy erosion.
41FY374
This site is on the western slope of the divide between Owl and
Blair creeks;
Owl Creek lies approximately 375 meters to the
northwest. The site is in and on either side of a cleared corridor
through dense woodlands of loblolly pine, cedar, post oak and yaupon
holly. Short grasses grow in the cleared area.
Soils are Tremona
very gravelly loamy fine sands (SCS 1979). Material culture at the
site was limited, consisting mostly of burned rock, with a few chert
secondary flakes, one chert core and one chert biface preform. A
hearth was observed eroding from the creek terrace where the burned
A biface and one secondary flake
rock scatter was most dense.
appeared to be in association with the hearth.
The extent of the
scatter was estimated at 50 by 45 meters. Soils were badly deflated,
with only two to ten centimeters above sterile clay.
The site has
also been affected by clearing and the construction of a fence.

112

APPENDIX II

41FY376
This light lithic scatter was found in an improved pasture
approximately 300 meters west of an unnamed tributary near the
headwaters of Blair Creek. The area is fairly level with a gentle
slope in the direction of the drainage. Vegetation consists primarily
of short grasses, with isolated cedar and oak trees.
Soils are
Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978). Material culture consisted of
scanty deposits of secondary and tertiary chert flakes and burned
rock, covering an area of 110 by 50 meters and reaching a depth of 80
centimeters.
No diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were
observed.
The site has been disturbed by erosion, clearing for
pasture and bioturbation.
41FY377
This site is on the west bank of the northern headwater branch of
Blair Creek in an area of short grasses and scattered post oaks and
cedar. Soils are Falba fine sandy loams (SCS 1981). The site appears
to be a.very light lithic scatter associated with a hearth, which was
observed eroding in a gully. A small number of chert flakes, burned
rock, one small chert biface and a dart point similar to the Lower
Pecos Langtry st.vle, suggestir.;, o. Middle Archaic occupation (4600-2250
BP), were found scattered over an area of 35 by 30 meters. Shovel
probes failed to unearth subsurface deposits.
The site has been
disturbed by erosion and probably by clearing.
Artifacts:
Unidentified Dart Point (Fig. 7i).
The tip and both barbs are missing from this specimen. The blade
has a wide triangular shape with beveled lateral edges on the left
side of both faces. The shoulders are barbed and the long stem
contracts to a small, concave base.

41FY379
This small, light lithic scatter is on the right bank of Albers
Branch of Shaw Creek, at the edge of a wide clearing. Vegetation
consists of post oak, cedar and yaupon holly woodlands, with clearings
covered in short grasses.
Soils are Bunyan fine sandy loams (SCS
1980). A sparse concentration of flakes, burned rock chips and two
cores was observed eroding from the drainage bank. The scatter
covered an area of 30 by 15 meters, and shovel probes showed no depth
to the deposits.
No diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were
found. The site appears to have been almost completely destroyed by
erosion.

CUMMINS CREEK

113

41FY381
This site is on a small knoll approximately 150 meters southeast
of the beginnings of an unnamed tributary to Jones Creek. The site is
in a cleared field with short grasses, scattered post oak and yaupon
holly.
Soils are Tremona loamy fine sands (SCS 1979). A small
drainage runs along a fenceline 50 meters north of the site. Material
culture, scattered across an area of 70 by 20 meters but concentrated
toward the site's center, consisted of one biface tip, several
tertiary flakes, two secondary flakes, several chert core fragments
and small pieces of burned rock. No diagnostic artifacts or cultural
features were observed.
The site has been cut through by the
construction of a gas pipeline, which appears to have severely
disturbed the deposits. One shovel probe showed deposits to a depth
of 100 centimeters, but another unearthed plastic at a similar depth.
Portions of the site lying away from the gasline, however, may be
undisturbed.
41FY382
This site, 200 meters west of the confluence of Cummins Creek and
an unnamed tributary, lies along the northern bank of the tributary in
been
a cleared and bulldo~~d area where a barn has recently
constructed. Vegetation consisted of pasture bordered by post oak and
cedar woodland. Soils are Tremona loamy fine sands (SCS 1979).
Several flakes, cores and one biface were observed lying on the
surface. The site lay beyond the proposed permit boundary, so no
determination of its areal extent or deposit depth was made. The area
appeared disturbed by erosion as well as by clearing and bulldozing.
41FY395
This site is on a short, broad finger ridge high above a small
intermittent tributary 100 meters to the southeast. Vegetation is
primarily short grasses, with scattered post oak, cedar and yaupon,
and dense woodlands on the perimeters. Soils are Falba variant loamy
fine sands (SCS 1981). Material culture covered an area of 60 by 35
meters, and consisted of numerous flakes, chips and cores of chert and
petrified wood and a single projectile point fragment, probably a
Hoxie type, indicating a possible San Geronimo phase Early Archaic
occupation (7000 - 6000 BP). Several large unmodified cobbles and
sandstone blocks were observed on the surface, suggesting the site
functioned as a lithic procurement area. No cultural features were
found.
Deposits reached a depth of 60 centimeters in shovel probes.
The site has been affected to some extent by erosion and possibly by
clearing.

Artifacts:
Probable Hoxie Dart Point. Early Archaic, San Geronimo phase, 7000
6000---sp-[Prewitt 1981).
The tip and the basal area of the stem are missing from this
specimen.
The point has been burned; lids are observable on both
faces. The blade is steeply beveled along the right lateral edge on
both faces.
Shoulders are slight and pointed. What remains of the
contracting stem indicates smoothing along the edges.
L: 5.0cm (approx) W: 2.0cm T: 0.6cm ST: 1.5cm
41FY412
This site, on the western edge of the interfluvial divide between
the Rabbs Creek Basin on the west and the Cummins Creek Basin on the
east, lies between two west flowing headwater tributaries of Owl
Creek.
Vegetation consists of post oak and cedar with scattered
yaupon. Soils are Falba variant loamy fine sands (SCS 1981).
The
site is best described as a light lithic scatter without features. A
small quantity of chert and petrified wood flakes were observed in a
cleared fenceline iÂ·oad and in a recently cleared house site area.
Four shovel probes reached a depth of 10 to 20 centimeters, with one
to three flakes in probes 2 and 4, and no cultural material in probes
1 and 3. One core/tool of petrified wood was observed lying in the
roadway.
No burned rock was found. Based on observable cultural
material, the site boundary was established at 50 by 50 meters.
The
site has been heavily altered by fenceline construction and clearing
for a house recently moved onto the site.
These aided the already
destructive forces of sheetwash and rilling that has occurred. The
combination of natural and artificial impacts has heavily altered the
integrity of the site; hence any further information obtainable would
be negligible.
41FY413
Site 41FY413 occupies the upper slopes of a west
northwest
flowing tributary of Jones Creek. The confluence lies approximately
800 meters from the site. Vegetation consists of pasture grasses with
scattered
post
oak, cedar and mesquite;
domesticates include
chinaberry and pear. Soils are Falba variant loamy fine sands (SCS
1981).
Shovel probes indicate 10 to 20 centimeters of sandy matrix
over most of the site.
The underlying clays vary in color from
brownish red to grayish brown with yellow mottles. Severe sheetwash
and runoff erosion have lowered the sandy cap.
Along the tributary
margins where sandstone has retarded the erosion, areas devoid of
vegetation have exposed artifacts on the surface as well as subsurface
mixing; a bottle fragment was found below several prehistoric flakes.
Erosion is also apparent in an area that has been borrowed for the
roadbed construction of FM 3011.
An area approximately 45 by 25

CUMMINS CREEK

115

meters has been scooped out by bulldozers, leaving an oblong mound of
backdirt in the southwest portion of the pit. Deflation and rill and
gully erosion are noticeable on the perimeter.
Obvious colluvial
redeposition can be observed at the bottom of the pit where there is
standing water. Other disturbances to the prehistoric component are
historic occupation and gopher burrowing. The latter is most evident
from the backdirt piles that dot the surface.
Both historic and
prehistoric artifacts were observed in these piles. Historic impact
is attributable to probable surface collection and surface alteration
construction as well as farming activities.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts were found at the site.
However, a perusal of artifacts in Mrs. Matejowsky 1 s collection from
the site indicate Early, Middle and Late Archaic, and Late Prehistoric
occupations.
Artifacts include chert and petrified wood flakes,
cores, burned rock and a biface blank. The areal extent of the site
is 55 by 80 meters.
The historic component consists of old barbed wire fencelines, a
wooden fence enclosure, a garden area, piled sandstone house supports
and various glasses and ceramics. The structure is no longer present.
Information from a former occupant depicts a single story four room
square house ~1~thout a central hall, oriented so that the two front
bedrooms and full length porch face southeast. Exterior siding was
vertical board and batten. One other structure, a barn, was also
located on the site. Water was carried from a well to the west. Corn
and cotton were grown at the site in the 1920s.
Recommendations for the prehistoric component are based on the
shallow, heavily eroded nature of the soils and evident mixing of
colluvial deposits on the north side. Due to these disturbances, the
recovery of significant prehistoric data would be negligible; further
evaluation is unwarranted.
Reconstruction of the historic component is based on the more
than adequate oral information from former tenants and the owner.
Further work, other than that now collected, could contribute little
to the compilation of local history.
41FY416
This site lies on the lower slopes of a west flowing tributary of
Jones Creek.
The divide between the Rabbs Creek and Cummins Creek
basins is 400 meters to the east. Vegetation consists of scattered
mesquite and pasture grasses. Soils are silty loams and clays of the
Wilson series (SCS 1981). The site is within proximity of chert
bearing gravels exposed along the slopes 100 meters to the southwest
and was defined on the basis of two biface cores and several flakes
observed on the surface and embedded in the soil. No burned rock was
noted. Based on the extent of observed cultural material, site size
was measured at 30 by 30 meters and fits the description of a

116

APPENDIX II

procurement area, probably being utilized by neighboring encampments.
No shovel probes were used because of soil density. Natural impacts
can be attributed to erosional gullying and rilling;
artificial
impacts stem from use as a pasture.
HISTORIC SITES
These sites and structures were recorded because they met at
least the minimum age criterion. Some were felt to be of value to
future researchers of vernacular housing and settlement patterns
and/or possible sources of corroborative data. In some instances,
their relationship with hamlets outside the 12 year permit area, but
in the study area, makes them candidates for inclusion in a program
treating those hamlets as collective entities.
41FY383 - Nechanitz Rent House Site
This site is marked by remnant domestic vegetation, chiefly
chinaberry trees and an iris bed. The outlines of a house foundation
are visible, as is a thin artifact scatter which includes twentieth
century diagnostics.
Joe Matejowsky of Nechanitz states that the
house which once stood here was moved to another location outside the
study area about 45 years ago. The site is appropriate for inclusÂ·ion
in a program for treating all of Nechanitz but not, as an entity,
considered eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places.
It is not within the 12 year mining
permit
area.
Mr. Matejowsky can provide valuable information on the original layout
of this property.
41FY384 - Withers House II
This is a square cottage with a truncated hip roof displaying
single dormer windows front and rear.
The house contains two
symmetrically placed internal chimneys.
A covered, open attached
porch fronts the center third of the house. Two over two light sash
windows are symmetrically placed throughout the house.
Each dormer
consists of two narrow windows separated by a wide mullion. The house
Nothing in its construction,
type is referred to as "pyramidal".
architectural style or materials suggests a building date earlier than
the 1920s. The site also includes a barn, garage, windmill and sheds,
all either newer or contemporaneous with the house.
41FY385 - The Withers-Lueke House and Barn
This farmhouse has undergone a series of remodelings
and
additions that have left the structure virtually unidentifiable
beneath asbestos siding and aluminum sash windows. Built by the Lueke
family, this house is now the Withers secondary residence. The roof
tyle suggests a shotgun house of late 1920s vintage lies at the core.
The second building in this complex is a two crib barn of split log

CUMMINS CREEK

117

construction with very irregular crude notching.
Although there is
some local lore that the building once served as a cabin, the lack of
windows and very low crib type doors that open into the unfloored
runway clearly indicate it was built as a two crib log barn of Middle
Atlantic influence (Jordan, Bean and Holmes 1984:188).
The roof of
the barn has not been kept in good repair and one crib corner is close
to collapse with dry rot. The house is not felt to be eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places nor is further
investigation necessary due to the lack of archeological, material or
associational merit.
The barn shows such crude use of log building
techniques that it is a poor example of that art. As a result, its
deteriorated condition is attributable more to poor construction than
to age.
41FY386 - The Freeman House
This farmhouse is an example of the L-shaped floor plan common in
early twentieth century homes of the region. The main wing is a
center hall, one and a half story with no exterior chimneys.
The
attic room is lit by windows in each gable, no dormers are present. A
porch runs across the front of the house. Perpendicular to the main
wing, a single story kitchen wing is attached. The house appears to
have been built as a single unit rather than in stages. The house is
currently occupied and in good repair. It is located within the 12
year mining permit area.
41FY390 - The Gallip Farm
This farm complex is on the southeast corner of the Vanderworth
league. The barn is very nearly a ruin but the house is in reasonably
good repair. It is currently vacant and appears to have been so for
some time. The house is one and a half story I-cottage with a gabled
roof. The attic room is lit by two large windows in each gable, there
are no dormers.
There are four rooms on the main floor and a metal
chimney. A porch with a separate shed roof runs across the front of
the house.
The general floor plan, roof, eave and window form, and
porch are all common types of the 1890 to 1910 era. The present owner
purchased the house from the Guehrs family, the reported owners of a
cotton gin in Ledbetter.
41FY391 - The Brand Farmhouse
This is another I-cottage similar in features to the Gallip
farmstead, but with shed additions to the rear and left gable side.
The house has been resided several times in the twentieth century.
The floor plan, porch, fenestration, roof and original materials
present no special characteristcs meriting further action and the
house is not felt to meet current criteria for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places.

118

APPENDIX II

41FY392 - The A.J. Berger House
This owner occupied house is now a single story four room cottage
with gabled, parallel ridged roofed additions to both sides. The
original plan appears to have been a story and a half square cottage
with four rooms and a loft. The present roof covers three quarters of
the porch which fronts the left side addition. Modern siding and sash
hung four over four windows with wide mullions were used in the
remodeling. A modern capped and flued chimney is also present.
The
overall effect is of a modern suburban home.
The modifications to this structure as so extensive that they
affect virtually all externally visible architectural features and
substitute modern materials and construction
methods
for
the
originals.
It is felt that these changes make the house individually
ineligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places,
but it could be part of any historic district formed around Waldeck.
It is outside the 12 year mining permit area.
41FY393 - The Mayer Farm
This house merited recording based on meeting the minimum age
criterion. It was built in 1925 in Bryan, Texas, and was moved to its
present location in 1936. It is currently occupied by the owner,
Mrs. Clinton Mayer.
The house is a single story low loft I cottage
with dual front entrances. It is not within the 12 year mining permit
area and does not meet established criteria for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places.
41FY394 - The Zingleman-Sweningsen House
This well preserved late nineteenth century farmhouse with
associated outbuildings is located in Waldeck only a short distance
from
the
cemetery
(41FY389),
school
site
(41FY407)
and
Finke-Matejowsky House (41FY396), and contributes to the nineteenth
century appearance of the community. Milton Zingleman, who now lives
next door, states his family built and resided in this house. The
house has been restored and is used by the present owners as a weekend
retreat.
It is an integral part of the Waldeck community and should
be included in the treatment given that hamlet.
41FY397 - The Emmet Lange Home
This house is central to a farm complex which includes a wooden
barn and several recent metal outbuildings. The T-shaped floor plan,
formed by centrally placing a rear ell on an I-shape, is common to the
area.
The main wing is one and a half story with single windows in
each gable of the attic room. The single story kitchen wing lies
perpendicular to the main body of the house. The porch across the
front of the main wing has been removed, but no other extensive
modifications, except for an attached carport, appear to have been

CUMMINS CREEK

made.

119

The house has been occupied by the Lange family for 26 years.

41FY398 - The Sternadel Farm
Only the much remodeled older house in this complex of buildings,
which includes a new house, appears to meet the minimum criteria for
recording. The extent of the remodeling of the house, however, makes
it difficult to estimate the date of its core. The current exterior
suggests that the house may be as late as 1930 in construction but the
actual core may be a decade or so earlier.
41FY400 - Site of the Bell Settlement School
This former site is marked by two features, a depression where a
privy once stood and the concrete steps that led into the building.
The structure was moved to LaGrange.
A thin artifact scatter of
window glass, bits of bottle glass, fragments of metal roofing and
other debris defines the general area. One cast iron fragment of a
student desk was collected by the field crew.
Research reveals this building was the second location of the
Bell Settlement school, the name derived from the general area which
was in turn reflective of the piecemeal sale of the nearby properties
by land speculator, James C. Bell. The school was one of 13 once
included in the Roundtop-Carmine School District and was in operation
from the turn of the century until consolidation in 1947. Several
former teachers were located and
collectively furnished
more
information on the physical appearance and cultural role of the school
than can be derived from subsurface testing. The site itself does not
meet criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
but the results of the informant interviews and archival research are
part of the forthcoming more detailed study on the community
patterning of the prospect.
41FY404 - The Erwin J. Wolff Home
Although the present owner/occupant states that the core of the
house is about a century old, neither the exterior general appearance
nor its floor plan offer any indications of nineteenth century origin.
The house is a heavily remodeled I-cottage showing profuse use of
modern materials and construction method. The extensive alterations
to a house type common in the area and its lack of association with
significant historical persons or events make it ineligible for the
National Register of Historic Places.
41FY405 - The Meiners/Fuchs House
The core of this house is a one and a half story main wing with a
one story kitchen wing forming the L-shaped floor plan. The house has
no exterior chimney nor masonry fireplace.
The present owner, Mr.
Gus Meiners who has lived in the house since 1943, was able to outline

120

APPENDIX II

the original section of the house, an addition added late in the
nineteenth century, another addition made in 1919 and where he had
reduced the house to its present size and configuration during
renovation
in 1943.
The house is surrounded by a number of
outbuildings of little note and lesser age than the house itself. The
house was originally erected by the Fuchs family. This dwelling can
be included in any further documentation carried out in conjunction
with that planned for the community of Nechanitz.
41FY406 - Site of the Nechanitz School
The locations of two school buildings are found at this site;
the first dates from the late nineteenth century when Nechanitz
qualified as a common school district.
The second building was
erected as a replacement in 1925 when a well was drilled on the
property. According to Mr. Joe Matejowsky, the water from this well
was never potable and drinking water continued to be brought in from
elsewhere. The second school building was torn down and the lumber
salvaged after the consolidation of several rural common schools in
1941. The well nead and a thin artifact scatter in the immediate area
are all that mark the site today. This site would be included in any
program treating with the hamlet of Nechanitz.
41FY407 - Site of the Waldeck School
Sandstone piers of the foundation and a set of concrete steps
mark the location of the Waldeck school, 50 meters south of the
cemetery. Local informants report that the school also served as the
first community church in Waldeck.
The land was donated to the
community by Wenzel Matejowsky, and was for many ye~rs administered by
the Waldeck School House Verein.
The site's location near the
cemetery and other sites at the south end of the Waldeck community,
would place it within any further study of the community as a whole.
41FY408 - The Joe Matejowsky House
This is a large and well built southern pyramidal style house
constructed in 1913 for the Charles Matejowsky family by Mr. Petzold,
the local builder of great repute.
It has been modified by the
removal of the dormers before the home was reroofed in 1972, and it
now presents a rather oddly pitched roofline for a one story house.
Mr. Joe Matejowsky is the current owner and occupant. This home would
make a contributing member to any National
Register
District
established to include Nechanitz.
41FY409 - The Brand House
This structure is basically an I-cottage but major additions and
remodelling have more than doubled the original floor space. A
three-quarter width attached porch with hipped roof fronts the
building.
At the right rear of the original house, an ell with a

CUMMINS CREEK

121

gable perpendicular to the main roof ridge has been added.
At the
left rear, the space within the ell and the main house has been made
into a flat-roofed additional which in turn has an ell extending
behind the right rear addition. Further, a third addition, another
I-shape as wide as the original house but deeper, has been attached to
the rear of the second addition. It is covered with an end-gabled
roof in imitation of the original house. The resultant configuration
is an extreme example of vernacular architecture's tendency to grow
and expand with time. The basic house is a common type for the area
and is the only component of sufficient age to qualify for recording
under that criterion. Materials, style and construction methods are
early twentieth century.
Those of the additions and porch become
progressively more recent. The house is currently owned and occupied
as a secondary residence by Ludwig Brand.
41FY410 - The Old Carmine Railroad Depot
This structure is a typical, late nineteenth century small town
railroad depot.
Recently moved from Carmine to its present location
to serve as a hay storage shed, it appears curiously out of place.
Although somewhat altered and showing the effects of both repairs and
subsequent neglect, the old station might meet consideration for its
historic significance were it still in its original Carmine location.
However, it has little relevance to the history of the study area and
many
duplicate
structures still stand where erected in small
communities in the general region.
41FY411 - The Herman Sons Lodge Hall
This facility is native to Waldeck but no longer stands in its
original location. A modern mobile home sits atop its former roadside
site; the lodge hall has been moved to the rear of the lot to make
room for the trailer. Mr. Marvin Speckels of Ledbetter states that
Lodge 210 met at this location from about 1905 to 1975.
When the
lodge elected to meet elsewhere, the building was moved from its prime
location.
The structure is a small (15 by 22 ft.) balloon frame building
with board and batten siding, unfinished inside. The original shingle
roof has been replaced with tin. The doors are in the gable ends, two
at each end, in the manner of a shotgun house. Each side wall has two
four over four light windows.
Door and window hardware
are
mass-produced items. The structure is now used as a shed.
The reuse of the lodge hall for storage and its displacement from
its original location have affected the character and composition of
the sheet refuse around the building. The commonplace architectural
style and the relocation have rendered the site ineligible for the
National Register of Historic Places as an entity but as an integral
part of the Waldeck Community it can contribute to any district
established around the hamlet.

APPENDIX II

41FY417 - Getz-Brambler Tenant House
According to Mrs. Esther Matejowksy, the most recent of three
tenant houses on the Matejowsky property once stood on this site. She
recalls occupancy by Louis and Vivien Getz, followed by the John
Brambler family, Black tenants. A neighbor, Mr. Wehrmeister and a
tenant in a similar rent house describe the three structures as alike
in floor plan with four rooms and a front porch.
The wooden
structures were used for storage until they deteriorated or the
materials were salvaged for use elsewhere. All that remains is a
sparse and dispersed artifact scatter. Further study of these three
rental houses will be carried out in conjunction with the more
intensive research into the community composition of early Nechanitz.
Interviews with former occupants and long-time local residents will
provide the basis for a reconstruction of the building characteristics
and layout of the property.
