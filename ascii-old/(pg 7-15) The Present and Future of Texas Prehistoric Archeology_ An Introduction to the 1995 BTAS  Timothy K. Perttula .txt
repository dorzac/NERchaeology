The Present and Future of Texas Prehistoric Archeology:
An Introduction to the 1995 BTAS
Timothy K. Perttula

ABSTRACT
The structure and content of this special collection of papers on the prehistoric archeology of Texas is
summarized. The purpose of the 1995 Bulletin of the TexasArcheological Society is to communicate to interested
members of the public, Native Americans, and professional and avocational archeologists what has been learned
about Texas’ prehistoric archeological heritage from 1950 to today, and discuss trends for the future study of the
state’s rich store of archeological resources.

INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE
OF THE VOLUME
Our understanding of the prehistoric archeology of Texas has come a long way since Dee Ann
Suhm (now Story), Alex D. Krieger, and Edward
B. Jelks (1954) published the now classic "An Introductory Handbook to Texas Archeology" as Volume 25 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological
Society. This book presented current knowledge of
the archeology of Texas, as well as an illustrated
compendium of the known pottery and projectile
point types in the state (the latter compendium was
separately republished by the Texas Archeological
Society and the Texas Memorial Museum in Suhm
and Jelks [1962]).
Since that time, a multitude of archeological
investigations have occurred in Texas--by both
avocational and professional archeologist alike-and the pace of archeological work has especially
quickened in the last 15-25 years with the passage of
Federal (principally the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and most recently amended in
1992) and State (the 1969 Antiquities Code of Texas,
as amended in 1995) laws and regulations concerning historic preservation and the conduct of archeological projects when important sites are to be
impacted by development projects. Recent archeological overview volumes commissioned by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Southwest Division
(COE-SWD), provide a good sense of the scope of
the archeological data base in Texas (with more
than 50,000 sites recorded to date) and surrounding

states, the types of investigations conducted across
the state, and the kinds of research problems and
questions that have been, and continue to be, the
subject of inquiry (Hester et al. 1989; Hofman et al.
1989; Jeter et al. 1989; Sabo et al. 1988; Simmons et
al. 1989; Story et al. 1990). While these volumes are
extremely valuable research documents, they are
not broadly accessible to all those interested in the
prehistoric archeology of Texas. Nor are the many
hundreds, if not thousands, of cultural resource management technical documents of surveys and excavations prepared by contract archeological firms for
clients, permit applicants, regulatory agencies, and
other government consumers; few copies are produced, few see the light of day, and few are written
to be read by more than the jargon-bound professional archeologist and cultural resource manager
(Fagan 1995; see also commentary in Bruseth and
Perttula [1995:1-2] about Texas archeology). Nevertheless, truly exciting and interesting archeologicat research is being conducted in this sometimes
bleak forum, and innovative ways must be found to
share this knowledge with the public and the interested avocational archeologist!
The Texas Archeologicat Society (TAS) has
contributed more than its fair share to the stock of
archeological knowledge by conducting annual
Field Schools across the state (see Richmond et al.
1985), with the results of the field school investigations being published on a regular basis in the Bulletin of the Texas ArcheologicaI Society (see
Mueggenborg 1994; Smith 1993; Turpin and Davis
1993; Houk and Lohse 1993 for recent publications

the various papers promise to present through the
careful consideration of the Texas archeological (and
paleoenvironmental) record, a new, vital, and innovative means of understanding the past.
While all regions of the state are not considered in this volume, important and innovative archeological research is producing exciting and
interesting results about prehistoric lifeways and
paleoenvironmental conditions throughout Texas.
Therefore, a short bibliography of some of the more
significant recent published reports for those regions is also included in this paper.

committing their time and resources to see it come
to fruition. Thanks also to the people at Morgan
Printing of Austin, Texas (especially Terry, Mark,
and Michael), for the innumerable tasks they
completed in a timely and professional manner, as
well as their efforts to make the publication look as
good as it does. Associate Editor Nancy G. Reese
(now in New Mexico!) also contributed her editorial
and proof-reading skills to the monumental editing
process. Finally, I thank Sergio Iruegas for his
assistance in redrafting Figure 1 in this introduction.
