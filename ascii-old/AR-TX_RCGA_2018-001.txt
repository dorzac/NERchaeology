Abstract

T

his report describes the results of Phase I
cultural resources investigation of workspaces associated with the proposed Line
1-N Abandonment Project in Harrison and Marion Counties, Texas. This field effort resulted in
the examination of 40 workspaces that totaled
2.83 ha (7.01 ac) in total extent. All fieldwork
was conducted in accordance with the procedures
outlined in the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended; the Archaeological and
Historic Preservation Act of 1974; and Title 36
of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66
and 800, as appropriate. Additionally, this survey
effort abided by the standards set forth in Archeology and Historic Preservation: The Secretary
of the Interior’s Guidelines, and with guidelines
contained within Preservation Connection: Texas’ Statewide Historic Preservation Plan. 20112020. Information provided by the Council of
Texas Archeologists, the Texas Archaeological
Research Laboratory, the Antiquities Code of
Texas, and the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeological Survey Standards For Texas and
Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiqui-

R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

ties Code of Texas also was utilized. This investigation was completed in January of 2018 by R.
Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc. on behalf of Texas Eastern Transmission, LP.
During survey, two historic standing structures, HSS-TJL-0117A and HSS-TJL-0117B,
were identified and recorded outside of but within
50 m (164 ft) of two adjacent workspaces located within Harrison County, Texas. However, the
use of these temporary workspaces will not alter
permanently, directly or indirectly, any physical
characteristics of these two historic resources.
Therefore, temporary use of these workspaces within the existing Line 1-N Abandonment
Project has no potential to cause adverse effects
to nearby properties as defined in 36 CFR Part
800.3. No further architectural investigations are
recommended for these two historic properties.
No additional cultural resources were identified
as a result of this investigation, and no additional
examination of the proposed workspaces associated with the Line 1-N Pipeline Abandonment
Project is recommended.

Introduction

Project Description
Texas Eastern plans to abandon three segments of the Line 1-N natural gas pipeline. These
abandonments are located in Harrison and Marion Counties, Texas. To facilitate this abandonment, removing liquids and other contaminants
from 8”, 10” and 12” segments will be conducted
by using compressed nitrogen. Where segments
are located in isolated areas, these abandonments will have their ends capped or plated with
block valves. At each state maintained roadway
crossing, railroad crossing, or body of water, the
pipeline segments will be abandoned per Texas
Department of Transportation and Harrison and
Marion County requirements. All above ground
appurtenances associated with each of the Line
1-N, 8”, 10”, and 12” segments will be removed.
In order to facilitate the abandonment of these
pipeline segments, a total of forty workspaces
totaling 2.83 ha (7.01 ac) were examined for cultural resources.

his document describes the results of
Phase I cultural resources survey of the
proposed Line 1-N Project in Harrison
and Marion Counties, Texas (Figures 1.1 and
1.2). Fieldwork for this project was completed
between January 15 and 19, 2018. This cultural
resources investigation entailed the examination of 40 workspaces that together totaled 2.83
hectares (ha) (7.01 acres [ac]) in extent. The investigated workspaces are associated with the
proposed abandonment of 8”, 10”, and 12” diameter pipeline segments that comprise portions
of Texas Eastern’s Lateral 1-N pipeline. This
cultural resources investigation was completed
on behalf of Texas Eastern by R. Christopher
Goodwin & Associates, Inc.
This field effort was designed to identify
and to evaluate all historic properties, archeological sites, cultural resources loci, standing structures, and/or cemeteries that may be impacted
adversely by the proposed project. All work was
performed in accordance with the procedures
outlined in the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended; the Archaeological
and Historic Preservation Act of 1974; Title 36
of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66
and 800, as appropriate; Guidance for Reporting
on Cultural Resources Investigations 18 CFR
380.12(f) and 36 CFR 800, Archeology and
Historic Preservation: The Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines; and with guidelines contained
within the Texas Historical Commission’s Preservation Connection: Texas’ Statewide Historic
Preservation Plan. This undertaking also was
guided by survey protocols promulgated by the
Council of Texas Archeologists, the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, the Antiquities Code of Texas, and the Texas Historical
Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure
for the Antiquities Code of Texas.

R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

Summary of Results and Recommendations
Intensive pedestrian survey augmented by
the excavation of 41 shovel tests failed to identify
any cultural material or evidence of intact cultural deposits within the limits of the proposed abandonments. However, two historic standing structures, HSS-TJL-0117A and HSS-TJL-0117B,
were identified and recorded outside of but within
50 m (164 ft) of two adjacent workspaces located
within Harrison County, Texas. However, the use
of these workspaces within the existing Line 1-N
right-of-way will not alter permanently, directly
or indirectly, any physical characteristics of with
these two historic resources. Therefore, temporary use of these workspaces within the existing
Line 1-N Abandonment Project has no potential
to cause adverse effects to nearby historic properties as defined in 36 CFR Part 800.3. No further

any of the proposed workspaces associated with
the Line 1-N Abandonment.
Previously Conducted Cultural Resources Investigations Conducted within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the
Proposed Project Line 1-N Areas
The 11 previously completed cultural resources investigations in Marion and Harrison
Counties were conducted to provide Section 106
compliance for projects regulated by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (n=4), the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (n=2), the Texas Department of Transportation (n=1), the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Rural Utility Service
(n=1), the City of Marshall, Texas (n=1), and the
Federal Highway Administration (n=1). An additional project was conducted by the Smithsonian
Institute at Site 41HS11 in 1951. The remainder
of these projects were completed between 1981
and 2009. None of these cultural resources investigations intersected or were located directly adjacent to the project items examined as a result of
this cultural resources investigation.

Previous Investigations
To ensure that all potential impacts to known
historic properties were addressed prior to investigating the project area, a review was undertaken
of those previously completed cultural resources
investigations, recorded archeological site locations, recorded historic standing structures, and
properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places situated within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the
currently proposed project workspaces. This review was conducted by R. Christopher Goodwin
& Associates, Inc., of data currently on file with
the Texas Historical Commission.
In total, 11 previously completed cultural resources investigations, 3 cemeteries, 1 National
Register-listed property, and 4 previously recorded archeological sites were identified within
1.6 km (1 mi) of the proposed project area. No
historic standing structures were identified during this review. None of the identified cultural resources are situated within or directly adjacent to

Previously Identified Archeological Sites Situated within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the Proposed Project Area
Four previously recorded sites were identified within 1.6 km (1 mi) within the examined
Line 1-N Phase I pipeline workspaces. None of
these previously identified cultural resources fall
within or directly adjacent to the three project
items. Each site is discussed in more detail below.
The Pecan Retreat Site (41MR257) is
situated 0.24 km (0.15 mi) east of the Cypress
River Airport and north of FM 134 in Marion
County, Texas. The site was identified during

the survey of a waterline infrastructure project
and described as a historic artifact scatter that
produced of glass, stoneware, whiteware, and a
single nail. The portion of the site within the waterline project right-of-way was recommended
as not eligible for listing on the NRHP (Perttula
and Nelson 2003).
The Dolly Bell Key Site (41MR259) was
characterized as a prehistoric lithic scatter that
also was identified during the survey of a waterline infrastructure project in Marion County,
Texas. Several pieces of lithic debitage were
recovered from three artifact producing shovel
tests excavated within the site area. The site was
assessed as not eligible for listing on the NRHP
(Perttula and Nelson 2003).
Site 41HS11, the Jodi Bender Site, was
situated approximately 0.45 km (0.28 mi) east
of the border of Marion and Harrison Counties
along the north and south sides of FM 134 (Weir
1989). The site, described as a Caddo period artifact scatter, produced ceramics, lithic debitage,
lithic tools, hematite, and a possible Native
American pipe fragment. The Smithsonian Institute conducted an archeological investigation
at the site in 1951, though that report currently
is unavailable. To date, the site has not been
evaluated applying National Register of Historic
Places Criteria of Evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [ad]); however, it previously was recommended
that the site be avoided in the future. The development of a data recovery plan has been recommended, in the event that the site could not be
avoided by future construction projects (Perttula
and Nelson 2003).
The Phoenix Plantation Site (41HS849),
is situated along Peter’s Chapel Road approximately 1.7 km (1.1 mi) north of the intersection
with Rayburn Road in Harrison County, Texas.
The site, described as the former location of a
plantation homestead, dates from approximately
1843 to 1853. Artifacts recovered from the site
included glass, brick fragments, square or cut
nails, historic ceramics, and smoking pipe fragments. The significance of the site has not been
evaluated, the National Register of Historic
Places eligibility of the site is not known.

National Register of Historic Places Listed
Properties within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the Proposed
Project Area
A single NRHP listed resource, the Locust
Grove plantation home, is situated within 1.6 km
(1 mi) of project items associated with the Line
1-N Phase I cultural resources survey. The Locust Grove plantation home is located along Bill
Coleman Road and near the town of Jonesville
in Harrison County, Texas. The Greek Revival
residence is part of the former cotton plantation
located on the property and one of several outbuildings still extant on site. The plantation was
constructed between 1847 and 1849 and included
several slave cabins, a barn, a log cabin, and extensive cotton fields. The Locust Grove Property
was listed on the NRHP in 1978.
Cemeteries situated within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the
Proposed Project Area
In addition to the above properties, three
cemeteries were identified within 1.6 km (1 mi)
of the Line 1-N Phase I project area. None of the
cemeteries are located within or directly adjacent
to currently proposed project items.
The Andrews Cemetery is located approximately 0.6 km (0.4 mi) east of the intersection of
FM 43 and CR 2116 and southeast of the town
of Karnack, in Harrison County, Texas. Directly
west of the Andrews Cemetery is the Andrews
African-American Cemetery. The Andrews Cemetery contains approximately 460 interments,
while the Andrews African-American Cemetery
contains approximately 30 interments.

Research Design
The current Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory was designed to
obtain data pertaining to the nature and distribution of all cultural resources located within the
proposed project items. Fieldwork for this investigation was comprehensive in nature; planning
took into account the results of the archeological
surveys previously completed within the general
project vicinity, as well as an assessment of the
probabilities for identifying cultural resources
within each survey item. Survey included onground inspection of all portions of the project
item; field methodology included both pedestrian
survey and systematic shovel testing throughout
the proposed project area.

All fieldwork was conducted in accordance
with the procedures outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended; the
Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of
1974; and Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and 800, as appropriate. Additionally, this survey effort abided by the standards
set forth in Archeology and Historic Preservation:
The Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines, and
with guidelines contained within Preservation
Connection: Texas’ Statewide Historic Preservation Plan. Information provided by the Council
of Texas Archeologists, the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, the Antiquities Code
of Texas, and the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas and
Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas also was utilized.

sites. Shovel tests were excavated at 50 m (164 ft)
intervals along a single survey transect where appropriate. Additionally, judgmental shovel tests
were excavated within the limits of some of the
workspaces to avoid buried utilities, roadways,
and other obstructions. In some cases, these obstructions prevented the excavation of shovel
tests within the workspaces; visual inspection
and pedestrian survey of these locations also was
utilized
Each survey shovel test measured approximately 30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter, and each was
excavated to a minimum depth of 50 cmbs (19.7
inbs), to sterile or compact clays, or until the
influx of ground water impeded the excavation
process. All shovel test fill was screened through
0.64 cm (0.25 in) hardware cloth; extremely wet
soils and clays were hand-sifted, troweled, and
examined visually for cultural material. Each
shovel test was excavated in 10 cm (3.9 in) artificial levels within natural strata and the fill from
each level was screened separately. Munsell Soil
Color Charts were used to record soil color; soil
texture and other identifiable characteristics also
were recorded using standard soils nomenclature. All shovel tests were backfilled immediately
upon completion of the archeological recordation
process.
As a result of this investigation, 41 shovel
tests were excavated successfully throughout the
40 workspaces associated with Line 1-N Abandonment project area (Appendix I). Two historic
standing structures were identified as a result
of the cultural resources survey of the proposed
project area and these are discussed in further detail in Chapter III. Both structures were located
outside of the project right-of-way.

Field Methodology
The field methods used to complete this investigation were designed to provide complete
and thorough coverage of the Area of Potential
Effect. This undertaking included pedestrian survey and systematic subsurface testing within the
limits of 40 proposed workspaces; in all 2.83 (ha)
(7.01 acres) were examined for cultural resources. In addition, this investigation also included
an architectural evaluation of any historic standing structures older than 50 years in age located
within or adjacent to the project area. These field
methodologies are described in more detail below.
Shovel Testing
Stratification of the proposed project area
was based on discussions held between the Project Manager and the Project Archeologist, as well
as on previously recorded site distributions and
settlement data gleaned from other archeological
surveys completed within the broader region, environmental factors such as elevation above the
surrounding terrain, slope, and proximity to, and
elevation above, perennial water sources. Each of
the workspaces proposed for the Line 1-N Abandonment project typically were less than 0.4 ha
(1 ac) in extent. Due to the small size of these
workspaces, these areas were considered to have
a high probability for containing archeological

Architectural Review and Standing Structures Recordation
Survey crews were instructed to record
any standing structures encountered during the
Phase I cultural resources survey of the proposed
project area that they perceived to be at least 50
years or more of age. Since the project has the
potential to impact or destroy historic properties,
the purpose of this architectural recordation was
to: (1) collect reconnaissance-level architectural
survey data for each building 50 years in age or

the proposed Areas of Potential Effect; (2) apply
the National Register criteria to each recorded
structure(s); and (3) apply the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation’s Criteria of Effect
to each historic property. The architectural survey was conducted within the entire project area.
In addition, the survey considered any historic
standing structures that were situated within 50

by several utilities aligned parallel with the road
and vegetation throughout the project item consisted of mowed grasses along the road shoulder
and ditch (Figure 3.4). Soils mapped in the vicinity of the workspace consisted predominantly of
Scottsville-Latex complex (ScxBn) soils (NRCS
2018). These clayey and loamy soils typically are
situated at summits and interfluves on flat terrain
(0 to 2 per cent slopes) and can be described as
moderately well drained.
Due to the presence of buried utilities and
the workspace location along the shoulder of
South I-20 Service Road, no shovel tests were
excavated within 8”-Dig Point #03 (Appendix
I). Visual inspection and photodocumentation of
the area failed to identify any cultural resources
within or in close proximity to the workspace.
No additional investigation of workspace 8”-Dig
Point #03 is recommended.

A total of two shovel tests spaced 50 m (164
ft) apart were excavated within this workspace.
A typical shovel test excavated within workspace
8”-Dig Point-04 exhibited two strata in profile
and extended to a maximum depth of 50 cmbs
(19.7 inbs). Stratum I, a yellowish brown (10YR
5/6) sandy loam extended from the surface to
25 cmbs (9.8 inbs). Stratum II, a light yellowish
brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, continued from
the base of Stratum I to 50 cmbs (19.7 inbs) (Figure 7.6; Appendix I).
No cultural resources were identified during
the cultural resources survey of this project item.
No additional examination of workspace 8”-Dig
Point #04 is recommended.
Workspace 8”-DIG POINT #05
Workspace 8”-Dig Point #05 is a rectangular-shaped area that measured 15 m (49.2 ft) in
width and 20 m (65.6 ft) in length. The workspace
encompassed 0.03 ha (0.07 ac) and was situated
along the north side of U.S. Highway 80 (Figure
3.1: Sheet 2; Table 3.1). Vegetation in the vicinity
of the workspace consisted of grasses, secondary growth species, and small stands of pine trees
(Figure 3.7). Soils mapped throughout the vicinity of the workspace consisted predominantly of
Scottsville-Latex complex (ScxBn) soils (NRCS
2018). These clayey and loamy soils typically are
situated at summits and interfluves on flat terrain
(0 to 2 per cent slopes) and described as moderately well drained.
A single shovel test excavated along the
western edge of the project item. This shovel test
extended to a maximum depth of 25 cmbs (9.8
inbs) and exhibited a single stratum of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam in profile.
Excavation was terminated due to the presence
of dense tree roots (Figure 3.8). No cultural resources were identified within the workspace and
no additional investigation of workspace 8”-Dig
Point #05 is recommended.

Vegetation in the area was described as grasses
within the extant corridor and a small wooded
area of mixed hardwoods located along the north
edge of the workspace (Figure 3.9). Workspace
8”-Dig Point #13/14 measured approximately 30
m (98.4 ft) in length by 15 m (49.2 ft) in width
and encompassed an area that measured 0.05 ha
(0.12 ac) in extent. The area displayed evidence
of relatively recent disturbance that included the
construction of a maintained gravel road located
along the north edge of the area, as well as levee construction associated with Clearview Lake
located within the southeastern corner of the
project item. Soils mapped in the vicinity of the
workspace consisted predominantly of Scottsville-Latex complex (ScxBn) and Eastwood very
fine sandy loam (EasEn) soils (NRCS 2018).
Scottsville-Latex complex soils are clayey and
loamy soils and typically situated at summits and
interfluves on flat terrain (0 to 2 per cent slopes)
and described as moderately well drained. Eastwood very fine sandy loams typically situated on
hillsides, back slopes, side slops, and interfluves,
and on moderately sloping terrain (5 to 20 per
cent) and are well drained.
A single shovel test was excavated along
the north side of the extant pipeline corridor.
The shovel test extended to a depth of 30 cmbs
(11.8 inbs) and revealed two strata in profile (Figure 3.10). Stratum I consisted of grayish brown
(10YR 5/2) sand that extended from the ground
surface to 10 cmbs (3.9 inbs). Stratum II, a pale
brown (10 YR 6/3) sand mottled with grayish
brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, continued from
10 cmbs (4.9 inbs) to 30 cmbs (11.8 inbs). Excavation was terminated due to the presence of
compact subsoils. (Figure 3.1; Appendix I). Pedestrian survey and shovel testing failed to identify any cultural material or intact cultural deposits and no additional investigation of workspace

workspaces consisted predominantly of Tenaha
loamy fine sand (TnD), 5 to 15 per cent slopes,
and Lilbert loamy fine sand (LuC) (NRCS 2018).
Tenaha loamy fine sands generally are situated on
strongly sloping (5 to 15 per cent slopes) terrain
at interfluves and backslopes and also described
as well drained. Lilbert fine loamy sands are situated within interfluves and along summits on
slightly sloping (2 to 5 per cent) terrain and described as well drained.
A single shovel test was excavated within
the northeast corner of the workspace 12”-Dig
Point #06 project item. Stratum I, a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam mottled with
strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) loamy sand, extended
from the surface to 10 cmbs (3.9 inbs) (Figure
3.75; Appendix I). Excavation was terminated at
10 cmbs (3.9 inbs) due to an influx of groundwater. Workspace 12”-Dig Point #07 was examR. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

ined visually and photodocumented. No cultural
resources were identified at either workspace. No
additional examination of workspace 12”-Dig
Point #06 or workspace Dig Point #07 is recommended.
Summary and Recommendations
In total, 40 workspaces encompassing 2.83
ha (7.01 ac) were examined for cultural resources.
Survey included utilizing pedestrian survey augmented by the excavation of 41 shovel tests. Two
historic standing structures, HSS-TJL-0117A and
HSS-TJL-0117B, were identified in Harrison
County, Texas. Temporary use of the workspaces
adjacent to Resources HSS-TJL-0117A and HSSTJL-0117B within the existing Line 1-N project
area will not effect the nearby properties. Following the temporary use of these two workspaces,
the areas will be restored, reseeded, and returned

no cultural material or evidence of intact cultural
deposits was identified as a result of the visual
inspection and subsurface examination of the 40
Line 1-N Abandonment workspaces. No additional examination of the workspaces is recommended.
